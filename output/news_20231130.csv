CLSK stock retreated 9.6% to $5.63 after hours. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) reported a FY 2023 loss per share of $1.29, which came in wider than the consensus by a hefty 52 cents. Revenue rose 28.1% Y/Y to $168.4M, but missed estimates by $1.37M. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) mined a record 6,903 bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in the fiscal year. The miner held $56M in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) assets as of September 30, 2023, versus $11.1M a year ago. In that same period, the world's largest cryptocurrency's price gained 38.8%. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has recently returned to levels from over a year ago, amid growing anticipation for a U.S. approval of a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund. CoinShares on Monday said that crypto funds had garnered their largest weekly inflows of the year. ""However, bitcoin price saw much volatility during the year affecting our revenues and margins accordingly. We also incurred an additional $32M of non-cash expense related to accelerated depreciation,"" CLSK finance chief Gary Vecchiarelli said in a statement . ""This acceleration was due to the reduction of estimated useful lives on our older and less efficient miners that we have pulled from service as part of our fleet upgrade or do not intend on using past the halving,"" Vecchiarelli added. The CFO was referring to an expected bitcoin halving in April 2024, an event in which the rate at which new bitcoins are released into circulation will be cut in half.

20902274,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563175,1701385228,3 Bitcoin-Like Proof Of Work Altcoins That Could Make You A Millionaire In 2024,"Bitcoin is still the leading proof of work blockchain and has already made massive moves over the years, with countless millionaires at the same time. However, with the price of Bitcoin having moved so much already, the upside is fairly limited, especially for crypto investors who do not have ample buying power to make a Bitcoin investment worth their while. In this vein, altcoins offer the best opportunity for smaller and retail investors to make the most money. But not just any altcoins; these coins also employ the proof of work mechanism, just like Bitcoin, making them a good choice, especially when they are newly launched. QUBIC: A Proof Of Work Coin Like Bitcoin The Qubic (QUBIC) coin is already making the rounds on social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) and with good reason. The blockchain uses a proof of work mechanism like Bitcoin. Led by IOTA co-founder Dominik Schiener, it has already garnered a reasonable following based on Schiener’s reputation. Related Reading: Top 2 Under The Radar Altcoins That Could Do A 70000% Run Like Kaspa (KAS) The coin is still trading well below $0.1 which could make it a good buy in the long run. With a current circulating supply of 71.425 trillion, its current market cap is currently sitting at around $200 million. 16% of the total supply has reportedly been burned already. Nexa (NEXA) Leads POW Altcoins Next (NEXA) is another proof of work blockchain, but unlike Bitcoin, it uses the UTXO Layer. This means that Nexa is a proof of work blockchain that is also able to support native tokens and smart contracts. To mitigate the problem of scalability often encountered by the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, Nexa employs Signatures and UTXO lookups. NEXA price at $0.000013 | Source: NEXAUSDT on Tradingview.com The Nexa token is currently trending below one cent with an around $35 million market cap at the time of writing. Given the kind of run that Kaspa (KAS) had even through a bear market, it puts in perspective the opportunity that lies with this token. Firo (FIRO) Firo (FIRO) is another proof of work coin that also holds a lot of promise among the altcoins that fall into this category. It rebranded from ZCoin and is a privacy-first coin, meaning it mixes two of the most sought-after attributes right now in the crypto market.

20900658,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563308,1701381616,"dYdX To Unlock $478M Worth Of Tokens, Will Bears Have A Field Day?","On December 1, dYdX, the layer-2 decentralized exchange, will unlock 150 million DYDX worth roughly $478 million to early investors and core team members. This substantial unlock has raised concerns among investors, who fear the influx of fresh tokens could substantially increase supply. If this is not matched by high demand, DYDX prices will likely pull back, reversing recent gains posted over the past few trading weeks. DYDX Worth $500 Million To Hit The Market According to Bubblemaps data, out of the $478 million worth of DYDX, over 50% is allocated to venture capitalists (VCs), including Paradigm and Polychain. Zooming back and looking at their data, VCs seeded $100 million to the layer-2 decentralized exchange. These tokens were distributed to private investors through five wallets, including Coinbase Custody, Investor Distribution, and the Foundation Wallet. Currently trading at over $3, DYDX is at February 2023 levels and technically bullish. However, the upcoming token unlock casts a shadow over the token’s positive momentum. Related Reading: Shiba Inu L2 Shibarium Crosses 4 Million Transactions As Burn Rate Explodes Notably, dYdX, postponed its token unlock by ten months. According to data, the humongous DYDX unlock was initially postponed from February to December 2023. Following this move, DYDX prices edged higher. Even so, prices pulled back before consolidating in the better part of Q2, Q3, and early Q4 2023. There was a pronounced rally in late October 2023 as DYDX rose, riding the optimism across the crypto board. At spot rates, DYDX is up 82% from October 2023 highs. However, looking at price action, bears are retesting the 20-day moving average of the BB. A break below this level might trigger a sell-off, pushing prices back to October 2023 highs. Which Way Could Take The Price Action? While it is likely that prices could contract ahead or after the unlocking event, the team has devised a way of mitigating the expected selling pressure. To illustrate, the initial unlock will release 30% of the total amount. Afterward, there will be monthly equal releases over the next three years. For optimists, however, that a significant portion of these tokens will go to the team, and investors could end up supporting prices. Team members and venture capitalists trade less frequently than retail investors, meaning the expected liquidation pressure, if any, could be limited. Moreover, some team members and even early investors might consider re-staking DYDX from their infrastructure, giving them more control.

42391946,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxpOV,1701380865,"Republicans' Leadership Squabbles Delayed U.S. Crypto Bills Until 2024, Key Lawmakers Say","Republicans had hoped to get U.S. crypto legislation through the House this year, but key lawmakers are now targeting 2024.  A Democrat who has negotiated on the legislation said success in the House may move the Democrat-controlled Senate.  After months of hoping U.S. crypto legislation could win House of Representatives approval this year, lawmakers doing much of the behind-the-scenes work are looking to 2024 as the time when digital assets bills may get passed by that Republican-controlled chamber though the efforts still face an uphill climb in the Senate where Democrats have the reins.  U.S. Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee's subcommittee that focuses on digital assets, said the House's consideration of two major crypto bills – one to regulate U.S. stablecoin issuers and another to form a broad system of rules for crypto markets – has likely shifted into ""early 2024.""  The House Republicans' recent fight over installing a new speaker – which ensnared key crypto negotiator Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) as stand-in speaker for a time – delayed the floor time lawmakers needed for the legislation, Hill said at a Blockchain Association event in Washington on Thursday.  ""That, I think, set us back a little bit,"" echoed Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) at the same event. Lummis, who has been pressing her own wide-ranging crypto legislation in the Senate, also suggested that the stablecoin bill, specifically, will make more progress next year. ""That is an area that could come early in 2024.""Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), who has also occupied a leading role in the House negotiations for both bills as the committee's top Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) withdrew support, suggested the industry needs to counter what House Democrats are hearing from outside groups and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler – a dedicated critic of the industry.  He was among a handful of Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee to buck his party's ranking member on the committee to favor both crypto bills this year. Waters has since indicated she's still open to moving forward on legislation, and Himes said Thursday that if Waters gets on board and the overall House approves a bill, ""a Democratic Senate sits up and takes notice.""  ""On the other side of the Capitol, the weather is uglier,"" Himes said of the crypto views of some Senate Democrats, including Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who runs the Senate Banking Committee. ""You could see a path, but I think it probably starts with a strong bipartisan vote"" in the House, Himes said.  Brown's banking committee ""has been a tough nut to crack,"" said Lummis, who is a member of that panel. But she said the fact that the U.S. Department of the Treasury recently came forward with crypto illicit-finance policy proposals is a good sign that the administration is now willing to negotiate, which could nudge the Senate Democrats, too.  Hill argues that the implosion of FTX last year and the recent massive settlement and criminal conviction of Binance, which may give some lawmakers pause about the sector, should actually encourage pursuit of the legislation.

Pando Submits Spot Bitcoin ETF Filing Switzerland-based asset management company, Pando Asset has become the latest entrant into the Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) race. The investment firm officially submitted its Spot BTC ETF filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 29. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Who Sold The Bitcoin Top Reveals How To Buy And Sell At The Perfect Time The news of the late filing comes as a surprise to the crypto space, as the final dates for the SEC’s decision on the Spot Bitcoin ETF approval approach. In the filing, Pando Asset provided a lengthy outline of its Spot BTC ETF, PBTC, highlighting its purpose, offerings, net asset value, regulatory compliance, tax considerations, and other factors. “The Trust was formed as a Delaware statutory trust on November 16, 2023. The purpose of the Trust is to own bitcoin transferred to the Trust in exchange for Shares issued by the Trust. Each Share represents a fractional undivided beneficial interest in the net assets of the Trust. The assets of the Trust consist primarily of bitcoin held by the Bitcoin Custodian on behalf of the Trust,” the filing stated. Pando’s BTC Spot ETF brings the total number of filed Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the crypto space to 13. Among them are applications from prominent financial institutions such as Grayscale, BlackRock, Ark Invest, WisdomTree, and others. The crypto space is presently anticipating the approval of these ETFs, as many crypto experts have predicted that a Bitcoin Spot ETF debut could result in massive inflows for BTC which may trigger a bull run. Spot ETF Approval Prediction While the crypto community awaits the US SEC’s final verdict on Spot Bitcoin ETF approval, a Bloomberg analyst, James Seyffart has predicted a favorable approval outcome for BTC Spot ETFs. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Identifies 3 Key Factors That Will Trigger Parabolic Move According to Seyffart, Spot Bitcoin ETFs could see potential approval by January 10, 2024. His prediction has also been backed by another ETF specialist, Senior Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas who gives a strong 90% likelihood for the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. “People asking me if we changed the odds. No, we are still holding the line at 90% odds of approval by Jan 10 (aka this cycle), the same odds we’ve had for months (before it was cool/safe). What we are watching for now: more amended/final filings to roll in and clarity on in-kind vs cash creates,” Balchunas stated.

42391948,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxpEF,1701374589,"Bitcoin Going From Boiling the Oceans to Draining Them, According to Critic","Longtime Bitcoin [BTC] critic Alex De Vries said each transaction on the Bitcoin network uses over 16,000 liters of water, enough to fill a small swimming pool.  De Vries yesterday published a research paper with his findings, arguing that a combination of miner cooling systems and the water consumption for miner energy sources are behind the massive usage.  The findings echo De Vries' previous criticisms of Bitcoin, which centered on the electricity usage of bitcoin mining. His tech research site, Digiconomist, for example, keeps a log of the footprint of each bitcoin transaction, putting it on par with ""808,554 Visa transactions or 60,802 hours of watching YouTube.""  The validity of calculating the energy cost per bitcoin transaction has, however, been criticized as having little relevance without further context. Cambridge University's Center for Alternative Finance, for instance, pointed out that ""transaction throughput is independent of the network’s electricity consumption. Adding more mining equipment and thus increasing electricity consumption will have no impact on the number of processed transactions.""  Digiconomist's name was also put to a 2017 prediction that Bitcoin would match the entire world's entire power consumption by 2020, an estimate which fell into a similar trap of predictions from the early 1990s about internet traffic and electricity use.  De Vries' latest offering to the Bitcoin discourse was met with criticism by Daniel Batten, founder of CH4-Capital, a startup that aims to remove methane from the atmosphere, a task for which he believes bitcoin mining can serve a purpose.  ""De Vries has a history of making predictions which [have] proven wildly inaccurate,"" Batten posted on X (formerly Twitter).  ""Rather than acknowledge error and move on, De Vries has simply pivoted his attack into other areas,"" Batten continued. ""Now that it is clear Bitcoin's major energy source is not coal (as De Vries had falsely claimed) but hydro, Bitcoin is suddenly bad for using too much water.""

42391952,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxpYl,1701372240,Paying for Use Slows Down Crypto's Search for a Use Case,"Polygon Labs gave DraftKings millions worth of MATIC tokens to become one of the Ethereum-scalable protocol’s 100 validators. The payments were never disclosed, but evidence is visible on-chain, CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson found.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Worse, DraftKings failed to maintain its validator's performance and was kicked off the network last month — despite receiving financial and technical support from Polygon as well as special privileges (like the ability to take 100% commission from delegators, well above the norm of 5%-10%).  When the tie-up was announced in early 2022, Polygon called it an ""important adoption milestone"" and “the first time a major publicly-traded firm has taken an active role in blockchain governance.""  See also: Polygon's Secret Deal: Sending DraftKings Millions to Run Failed Validator  While it's fairly common for Web3 companies to pay mainstream brands, celebrities and influencers to promote or use their crypto protocols, discussing such deals as a signal of ""mainstream adoption"" is both an overstatement and undermining of crypto's supposed values.  And, at least in Polygon's case, there are often other costs associated with these type of special arrangements. As Nelson writes:  ""DraftKings' earnings came at the expense of every other staker in Polygon's ecosystem. The network only issues a finite number of MATIC rewards to stakers annually. At least 80% of DraftKings' Polygon-delegated tokens came directly from the Foundation, meaning they were not previously being staked. These newly delegated tokens diluted how much rewards everyone else could get.""  And:  ""Polygon's undisclosed allocation to DraftKings – and its validator's near-complete reliance on Polygon – undercut the blockchain company's own characterizations about the validator being like all the others.""  It'd be hard to say exactly that Polygon did wrong by subsidizing DraftKings' use of the network. DraftKings did participate in other Polygon-related efforts, and made good use of a Polygon-based NFT platform. But the image being projected of crypto being willingly used and chosen by major brands is a falsehood, and one that will only end up costing the industry more in the long run.

The company’s former CEO, Michael Saylor, announced the acquisition of an additional 16,130 BTC, valued at approximately $593 million. This strategic move comes as Bitcoin enters a phase of accumulation above the $37,000 mark. MicroStrategy Adds To Bitcoin Stash As announced, MicroStrategy’s latest purchase was made at an average price of $36,700 per Bitcoin. With this acquisition, the company’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at an impressive 174,530 BTC. Throughout 2023 and previous years, MicroStrategy has consistently demonstrated its commitment to BTC, accumulating a substantial amount of the cryptocurrency. The total cost of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investments exceeds $5.20 billion, with an average purchase price of $30,252 per Bitcoin. This significant investment reflects the company’s long-term bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and hedge against inflation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Ready To Push Price Above $40,000? Data Throws Clues As reported by NewsBTC, the company has reaped substantial gains from the recent uptrend in the overall cryptocurrency market and Bitcoin’s impressive price surge. With BTC experiencing a 36% increase since October, Microstrategy has now amassed over $1 billion in unrealized profits. Notably, Bitcoin’s positive performance has directly impacted Microstrategy’s stock, traded under the ticker name MSTR. The stock has witnessed a significant surge in value, closely tied to the ongoing bullish momentum of BTC. On November 9, as Bitcoin reached its previous yearly high of $38,000, the price of MSTR stock also soared to an all-time high (ATH) of $533 per share. This milestone further proves Microstrategy’s successful investment strategy over the past three years. Michael Saylor, a prominent advocate for Bitcoin, has been a vocal proponent of the cryptocurrency, emphasizing its superior qualities compared to traditional fiat currencies. MicroStrategy’s continued accumulation of Bitcoin reinforces Saylor’s conviction in its long-term prospects and serves as a testament to the company’s belief in the digital asset’s store-of-value properties. Potential For Short-Term Pullback Looms In a recent market update by the CryptoQuant author IT Tech, short-term insights on the Bitcoin derivatives market shed light on the current upward momentum and the potential for a minor pullback. According to the analysis, the ongoing upward momentum in the Bitcoin market heavily relies on perpetual movement. The rising price of Bitcoin has been a key driving force, contributing to the bullish sentiment. However, the Crypto Volatility Divergence (CVD) Spot indicator suggests a relatively flat movement in spot demand. This indicates that a significant increase in immediate spot demand may not support the current price surge. Related Reading: Robinhood (HOOD) Extends Trading Services To The UK In the absence of strong spot demand materializing in the market, IT Tech suggests a possible minor pullback in the near term. This potential pullback could be attributed to several factors, including profit-taking by traders or a lack of sustained buying pressure from spot investors. The analysis also highlights the possibility of Bitcoin liquidations in the short term, which could indicate further upward movement to liquidate late short positions. This suggests that additional buying pressure may be from those who have taken short positions on Bitcoin. As these shorts are liquidated, it could continue the upward trend. As of the latest update, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $37,600, showing a slight decrease of 0.5% over the past 24 hours. However, it has maintained a gain of 1.5% over the past seven days, indicating a period of consolidation for the cryptocurrency Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/microstrategy-boosts-bitcoin-holdings-with-590-million-purchase-totaling-174530-btc/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

According to data from the crypto analytics platform Lookonchain, this enigmatic entity transferred 3,623 BTC, worth roughly $136.94 million, to two newly created wallets. Market Speculations And Potential Impact This mysterious investor initially accumulated their Bitcoin holdings at an average cost of $6,889 per unit from October 25, 2018, to December 31, 2019. Initially, the total investment stood at approximately $24.96 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Unbreakable Floor? Analyst Predicts BTC Won’t Fall Below $35,000 Ever Again However, at present market conditions, this investment has grown significantly and is now estimated to yield around $112 million in profits. The transaction’s significance extends beyond its sheer magnitude. It is particularly noteworthy for its timing, aligning with Bitcoin’s recent surge to a peak price not seen since May of the previous year, reaching around $38,400 per Bitcoin. A whale that had been dormant for ~4 years transferred all 3,623 $BTC($136.94M) to 2 new wallets 1 hour ago. This whale accumulated 3,623 $BTC($24.96M) at ~$6,889 from Oct 25, 2018 to Dec 31, 2019. At current prices, the profit is ~$112M.https://t.co/QL3fPiV900 pic.twitter.com/wrMe4loIwm — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 30, 2023 The sudden activity of this substantial Bitcoin holder has sparked speculation and discussions within the crypto community. On the X platform, a user pointed out the timing of the whale’s movement as it coincides with Bitcoin’s recent rally to a significant high. This observation has led to conjectures about the whale’s potential insider knowledge or strategic market insights, especially considering the substantial profit they are currently sitting on. Notably, the actions of large-scale holders, often dubbed ‘whales,’ can exert considerable influence on the crypto market. A transaction of this magnitude could signal various strategic moves, ranging from portfolio restructuring to preparing for a market exit. Such movements are closely monitored as they can provide insights into market sentiment and potential trends. A Closer Look At The Bitcoin Whale’s Strategy Delving deeper into the whale’s investment strategy reveals a calculated approach to Bitcoin accumulation. The purchase of Bitcoin at an average cost of $6,889 per BTC during the 2018-2019 period indicates a strategic entry during a time when the market was relatively bearish. The subsequent hold for four years through various market cycles underscores a long-term investment mindset, contrasting with the short-term trading strategies often seen in the crypto space. The recent awakening of this whale and the transfer of a significant portion of their holdings to new wallets might indicate a shift in strategy. While it’s speculative to predict the whale’s next move, this could involve cashing out on some of their investments or redistributing assets for diversification. It’s also plausible that the whale is positioning for new investment opportunities within the crypto space, potentially in sectors such as decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

The launch of Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 solution, has been a huge catalyst for the meme coin. At the same time, SHIB’s burn rate has exploded in the last two days, as investors look to push the price of SHIB in a positive direction. Shibarium’s Rapid Growth, Burn Rate Skyrockets In just the past few months, over 4 million transactions have taken place on the Shibarium network. According to Shibariumscan, the total transaction count now stands at 4.27 million at the time of writing, with the total block count also at 1.87 million, steadily approaching 2 million. The platform saw its daily transactions soar last weekend, reaching as high as 43,690 on November 23. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Who Sold The Bitcoin Top Reveals How To Buy And Sell At The Perfect Time This milestone seems to have rolled over to Shiba Inu’s token burning. According to data from Shibburn, Shiba Inu’s burn tracker, the burn rate has increased significantly this week. The last 24 hours have seen the token burns reach 82,887,109 SHIB, an increase of 913.89% from the previous day. SHIB tokens can be burned by any Shiba Inu investor by sending the tokens to any of the SHIB burn addresses. Apparently, most of the latest 24-hour figure came from one address, which incinerated 82.86 million SHIB tokens. The uptick in SHIB burns has been going on for a while now. The burn rate increased by almost 500,000% over the weekend with more than 264.20 million SHIB tokens sent to inactive addresses. What’s Next For Shiba Inu — Road To $0.00008? Shiba Inu burns are a way to create artificial scarcity for SHIB, driving up the price of the tokens in circulation. However, the price of SHIB hasn’t reacted to the recent burns and the Shibarium transaction milestone. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Identifies 3 Key Factors That Will Trigger Parabolic Move Shiba inu is currently trading at $0.000008221 and is down by 1.62% in the past 24 hours. On the larger timeframe, the crypto is up by 13.68% from its October bottom of 0.000006. The fundamentals surrounding SHIB also point to a price rise in the coming months as support grows. With increasing utility, the creation of new tokens in the SHIB ecosystem, partnerships like the recent one with boxer Manny Pacquiao, and more widespread mainstream interest on the horizon, analysts see SHIB revisiting and possibly surpassing its former high of $0.000088.

42391957,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxpyP,1701362796,"UK Won’t Excuse Ignorance in the Hunt for Unpaid Crypto Taxes, Experts Say","The U.K. on Wednesday published notices encouraging crypto users to voluntarily report unpaid taxes to avoid penalties.  A 2022 government survey showed 72% of crypto owners in the U.K. had not read its crypto tax guidance, but ignorance won't count as an excuse for tax evasion, experts told CoinDesk.  Regulators can use a number of tactics, including whistleblowers and creditor lists from recent bankruptcies to track undeclared crypto, tax advisors say.  The United Kingdom is cracking down on unpaid crypto taxes. Investors may not know that they owe the government money, but ignorance won’t work as an excuse, tax advisors told CoinDesk.  In fact, the government could employ several different tactics to track down who’s not paying taxes or hiding crypto holdings, David Lesperance, founder of tax advisory firm Lesperance and Associates, told CoinDesk in an interview.  On Wednesday, the country's Treasury asked crypto investors to voluntarily calculate and disclose any unpaid income or capital gains taxes to avoid penalties or additional interest. Disclosure requirements apply to exchange tokens like bitcoin [BTC], non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and utility tokens.  Some investors may not have even read the guidance or realized that their NFT trades could constitute taxable events, Dion Seymour, crypto and digital asset technical director at tax firm Andersen, told CoinDesk in an interview.  But if crypto holders don’t figure out what taxes they owe and come forward voluntarily, it could make matters worse for them, David Lesperance, founder of tax advisory firm Lesperance and Associates, said during an interview with CoinDesk.  ""[The Treasury] is going to say, okay, if you're going to make us look for you, it's gonna cost you,"" Lesperance said.  Tracking unpaid tax  There are a number of ways that the government can find those who have not paid their crypto tax, Lesperance said. If an investor has money with collapsed crypto firms like FTX exchange or lending platform Celsius, then that investor could be “named as a creditor,"" during bankruptcy proceedings, he said.  The Treasury can check if those funds are included in tax returns, Lesperance added. The government can also rely on whistleblowers who know you invest in crypto, he said.  However, the Treasury may need to invest in more resources and hire companies like Palantir to help with investigations, Lesperance added.  The U.K. was also among nations that recently welcomed new international norms for crypto tax data sharing between authorities developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  ""This means a lot more information going to [the Treasury] than people previously would have expected,"" Seymour said.  Calculating unpaid tax  If investors took “reasonable care” when declaring their taxes, they may have to pay what is owed in unpaid taxes to the government for a maximum of three years preceding the current tax year, the government said.  ""If you took reasonable care, you read the guidance and you misunderstood it, but then you asked a tax consultant about it,"" Seymour explained.  If investors didn’t make an effort to get their taxes right, then they might have to pay up for a maximum of 6 years.  Those who deliberately evaded taxes – knowing that they should have paid them – or deliberately reported wrong figures, could pay a maximum of 20 years worth of tax on their crypto.  Not contacting the Treasury could mean additional interest and penalties, the government said, but they can be minimized if any errors are reported. The government can slap investors with penalties between 30% and 100% of the extra tax due for deliberately concealing crypto holdings from the government.  Ignorance is not bliss  People may not know how much crypto tax they owe, Seymour said. A 2022 government survey showed that about 72% of former and current crypto owners had not seen the Treasury’s crypto tax guidance.  On top of that, ""the taxation of crypto isn't necessarily as straightforward or intuitive as some people may like,"" Seymour said.  People may not always realize they are creating taxable events, Seymour added. For example, purchasing an NFT using crypto like ether [ETH] can be a taxable event, he said. Purchasing crypto using other crypto could also be a taxable event.  ""If [investors have] actually used software or they've kept on top of it as they've gone through the process then it won't necessarily be too bad, but if they haven't, then it can actually be quite a difficult process for them to calculate everything,"" Seymour said.

42391959,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxq3X,1701362700,Crypto for Advisors:  Investing in Web3,"Beyond just crypto, technology continues to evolve, and a basket of new solutions such as blockchain, machine learning and AI are contributing to the next iteration of the internet, referred to as Web3.  This week, Alex Tapscott, author of the new book Web3: Charting the Internet’s Next Economic and Cultural Frontier, takes us through the evolution of the Internet and how investors gain access to new investments.  Also, you heard it here first, Consensus by CoinDesk is offering an exclusive session for advisors. Reply to this email for early access and VIP entry while seats last.  – S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Can Investors Gain Web3 Exposure from The Stock Market?  To those who don’t follow new technologies, innovations can sometimes look like overnight success stories. More often, they are decades in the making. Today is a rare moment as four transformational technologies, decades in the making, are hitting their stride at once: blockchains, AI, the internet of things (IoT) and extended reality.  These technologies are not separate but related. Just as the term ‘internet’ went from describing a narrow set of technologies to encompassing a range of technologies, business models, cultural upheavals, and social transformations, so too will the term Web3 come to capture this next era of progress.  Advisors and investors are searching for the best ways to gain exposure to these disruptive technologies. In the mid-1990s, we could choose among many emerging internet companies or other firms like Cisco that were seen to be capital on that first era of the web. Other legacy businesses deemed safe bets, such as Blockbuster, Borders, Compaq, JCPenney and Xerox, didn’t fare so well. Those companies had one thing in common: they were about to be disrupted or disintermediated by the first era of the web.  If viewed through the lens of the internet, investors would have evaluated them differently. Today Web3 requires a new lens on the markets. As with the early web of the 90s, Web3 will become an integral technology for business and will create winners and losers. So far, most of the value has been created in blockchains like Ethereum or private enterprises like OpenAI. But what about the public markets? Can investors gain exposure to Web3 by buying stocks?  We believe the answer is yes. Today, dozens of great companies are reaching into the Web3 toolkit to create new products and services, target new customers and unleash new capabilities.  Consider U.S. dollar stablecoins, which we believe will become ubiquitous payment tools, with companies like PayPal (PYPL), which recently launched its own stablecoin, PYUSD. So far, PYUSD is a small part of the overall stablecoin market, but it is growing very quickly, having increased the total supply in the first 100 or so days to around $150 million in circulating supply (Figure 1).  Figure 1: PYUSD Growth Rate  We believe the stablecoin market could grow to $200 billion in 2024 with PYSD reaching up to $5 billion (Figure 2). Stablecoin economics are lucrative, as issuers invest deposits into U.S. government debt, yielding 4-5%. Circle, a highly innovative global financial technology firm, with its own popular stablecoin USDC (with a circulating supply of over $20 billion) is mulling a public offering of its own. Indeed, the growing investment universe of pure-play Web3 companies and those adopting the technology is a tailwind for managers and advisors.  Figure 2  Second, there are simple and easy ways to get exposure to crypto assets directly via the public markets and OTC-traded products in the U.S. In an earlier edition of this newsletter, I wrote how Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust was attractive, not only because it offered exposure to ETH but also because at the time it was trading at an implied discount of more than 30%. We believe an ETH ETF is a matter of when, not if, and when that happens ETHE will convert, all but eliminating the discount. Furthermore, spot bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs already exist in Canada.  Third, a growing number of enterprises are embracing tokens and starting to make a lot of money from them. Nike and other innovative companies have already embraced tokens. For example, Nike has generated $385 million in revenue across 25 different NFT collections since December 2021. Other brands following in Nike's footsteps include Adidas ($150 million in NFT revenue), Dolce & Gabbana ($27 million), Gucci ($16 million), Tiffany & Co. ($15 million), and several others. Disney also announced a partnership with blockchain company Dapper Labs to launch its own Web3 initiative. Over time, the companies who embrace digital assets will be better positioned on the web’s next frontier.  – Alex Tapscott, managing director of the Ninepoint Digital Asset Group  Ask an Expert  Q: What are NFTs?  A NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a tokenized record of ownership that is distinct, indivisible and has its ownership and properties accounted for and verified using a blockchain.  These tokens differ from other blockchain-based tokens because they are “non-fungible,” or something that cannot be substituted directly by another of the same type.  They can be used to represent ownership of any digital or physical asset, intellectual property or rights.  NFTs can be used to ascribe uniqueness and ownership to any digital file including pictures, music, videos, articles, social media posts, software etc.  The key features that make NFTs so useful are:  Ownership status and history asserted by a distributed blockchain  Uniqueness and ownership can be ascribed to digital files (e.g. pictures, music, video, software, etc.)  Easily transferable  Ownership is verifiable 24/7 by anyone with access to the internet  –Layne Nadeau, NVAL  Keep Reading  British investment managers have been given the green light to tokenize funds, providing the ability to fractionalize shares and offer lower cost and transparent trading.  Crypto spot ETF approvals could see $70 billion influx according to recent analysis.

The MUNGER token subsequently lost more than 98% of its value on Thursday after details emerged around the token's smart contract, which had erroneous functions programmed that allowed developers to restrict the sale of the asset.  The former vice chairman of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway and described by Warren Buffett as his closet partner and right-hand man, Munger was a staunch bitcoin skeptic who once described the world's largest cryptocurrency as ""detestable.""  ""I just think the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization,"" Munger said about cryptocurrencies in general earlier this year.

The increase follows almost two years of down-shifting, “thus creating some optimism that the worst might be behind us in terms of the medium-term trajectory for DeFi/NFT activity, “ the report said.  “While we do not doubt this recent revival in DeFi/NFT activity is a positive sign, we believe it is too early to be getting excited about it,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain. NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items and can be sold or traded  JPMorgan says some recovery in DeFi is to be expected given the increased trading activity, some of which is executed on decentralized exchanges. Liquid staking by Lido is also partly responsible.  Additionally, ether [ETH] has underperformed other cryptocurrencies, so measuring total value locked (TVL) in ETH terms would mechanically show some improvement, as these other digital assets have gained more in recent months, the authors wrote.  Still, the rise of new chains and DeFi protocols such as Aptos, SUI, Pulsechain, Tenet, SEI and Celestia in the past year is encouraging, the bank said. NFTs have also benefited from the emergence of Bitcoin ordinals.

Recent data cast light on the current market structure and what could trigger an extension in the bullish momentum. Related Reading: Rare Signal Predicts Next XRP Price Move: Crypto Analyst As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $37,900 with a 1% loss in the last 24 hours. Over the previous week, the cryptocurrency has traded in the green as other assets recorded small losses, except for Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE). Big Day For The Bitcoin Price: What Whales Are Planning Data shared by crypto analytics platform Material Indicators shows the current state of the orderbook for trading venue Binance. The world’s largest crypto, looking into this orderbook often reveals patterns and clues to anticipate the price action. Today, Bitcoin faces two potentially high volatility events: whales will fight over the monthly candle close, and the US will reveal macroeconomic data. Thus, the cryptocurrency could finally break above its current levels or re-test support. The data from Material Indicators, as seen on the chart below, shows a spike in buying orders from Bitcoin whales and “mega” whales (Purple and Brown on the chart, respectively). This buying pressure is unlikely to translate into a rally as these investors prioritize market efficiency. Thus, they place small orders on exchanges to reduce slippage, leading the price to range. The good news is that this behavior is often positive for the BTC price by attracting, according to Material Indicators, “bid (buy) liquidity.“ Once there is enough liquidity in the order book, whales can sell their positions and avoid downside slippage. The firm stated: The more they attract, the more they can dump while minimizing slippage. Over the past 7 Days, Purple Whales have Market Bought ~$16M of #BTC and in 4 hours distributed ~$42M to the bidders they lured into the range. Regardless of whether you are bullish or bearish, there are #trading opportunities ahead, as this game appears to be on extended play mode.

Robinhood To Offer US Stock Trading In the UK Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Robinhood Vladimir Tenev confirmed the expansion toward the UK sector in an interview with Bloomberg. According to the CEO, the expansion aims to bring the US stocks into the UK market. The CEO stated: The intention is, for the U.K. market, Robinhood to be the best place to invest U.S. stocks, U.S. dollars, and we believe we can fill that need better than anyone else. Tenev noted that the company plans to gradually extend its platform to all users in the United Kingdom in early 2024. With the launch, consumers in the UK market will be able to trade 6,000 equities in the US market. Related Reading: Dogecoin And Bitcoin Become Latest Additions To Robinhood Wallet The CEO further asserted that a waitlist has been made available to people who wish to gain early assess to the app. Furthermore, the platform’s launch in the UK is under the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulation. Additionally, the platform offers users features like a five percent interest, and can change their uninvested funds from pounds to dollars. These offers aim to attract a larger range of investors, particularly those with little financial resources. Robinhood’s expansion sparks wider growth for its business globally. The CEO explained, “I aspire for Robinhood to be a global company. That’s been the plan from the very beginning. Baiju and I started this company as immigrants and children of immigrants, and so, the idea of making our services available to anyone in the world is just the vision that I had in mind from the very beginning.” The company’s entry into the UK market also puts it in direct competition with national and international companies. These include companies like Public.com, based in New York, Revolut, and Freetrade, among others. Zero – Fee Trading Initiative The CEO also underscored the platform’s commitment to offering Zero-Fee trading and accessible trading alternatives for UK users. This initiative is similar to the effective charge reduction strategy that was put in place in the US before the epidemic. Related Reading: Robinhood Wallet Introduces Swapping For Bitcoin, Dogecoin, And Ethereum Notably, Robinhood does not demand any commission fee for buying and selling stocks on the platform. Due to this, individuals can start creating their investment portfolios with a minimum of one US dollar (79p). Tenev explained: So we are launching imminently to the initial set of customers in the UK, and what we are launching is a commission-free share trading of US stocks. With its zero-fee trading strategy, the platform’s introduction into the UK market will completely change how average investors interact with the stock market. Also, with its focus on technology and user-centric features, the platform is poised to impact the current market. It will also bring fresh energy to the UK investment landscape.

There are potential bearish factors like the Mt. Gox repayment and the conversion of the Grayscale Trust into an ETF. I believe the upcoming Bitcoin halving and the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs are likely to remain dominant forces and the price trajectory continues. ProShares Bitcoin Strategy (BITO) is a Bitcoin ETF that' gives investors exposure to Bitcoin futures. For people that don't want to bother with setting up their personal wallets, it is a fine way to gain simple Bitcoin exposure. The ETF charges a fee of around 0.95% per annum. The runup in Bitcoin this year, however you own it, is, of course, great. Data by YCharts But occasionally, when I see it, I get the urge to decrease my position when faced with negative news or price action. Although not without risk, I believe it is quite important to hold Bitcoin here. Trained as a value investor, these are the toughest situations for me. I'm used to buying at a discount, sitting through deep bear markets, and tolerating my companies going nowhere. Flipping them as they achieve fair value or something close. I'm not as well trained to let investments run. There are several reasons why I want to do just that and I'll get into these in this article. Bitcoin went through quite a bear market. It could have been worse, but it had major and widespread consequences. Big and small names disappeared, fortunes were lost, and the industry disappeared from the front pages for a long time. This year's Bitcoin surge seems driven by the possibility of spot Bitcoin ETF launches and the Bitcoin halving, which is expected in April 2024. These events are exactly why I've been fairly bullish on Bitcoin. In addition, I think the collapse of the SPAC market and venture funding in general is also helping a lot. Bitcoin mining firms were receiving funding on very favorable terms. People were throwing money at these with little regard for the likelihood of a realistic return. A flood of mining machines got hooked up and started humming. When Bitcoin was going up, all these mining firms were hoarding coins. When Bitcoin started falling AND funding dried up, they started selling more and more. All part of a pretty standard boom-and-bust mechanics. There are a few near-term bearish arguments that I think deserve consideration. The top one is the Mt. Gox repayment , which I now expect next month or early 2024. J.P. Morgan (JPM) made the second one, which is the conversion of Grayscale, leading to a potential avalanche of sales. I think the Grayscale trust trade is still very good. This trade is based on a typical closed-end fund arbitrage. A closed-end fund typically trades at a discount to NAV (net asset value). When converted into an ETF that discount disappears because ETFs have a creation/redemption mechanism. If a trader wants to profit from the discount to net asset value disappearing, he or she goes long the CEF and shorts the portfolio of the CEF in the market. Sometimes, shorting the exact portfolio of the CEF is impossible. For example, if it holds private assets. In cases like that, you short a proxy. If the CEF contains private debt, for example, you could short the high yield bond ETF ( HYG ) against it. It may seem better to forgo the short. Why not just go long, and you'll pick up the discount and the underlying beta? Doing that is the approach that will lead to higher average returns on the position. But it is considered considerably worse by most players engaging in stuff like this. If you take the long/short position, you effectively tie up little or no capital. Your return on equity is sort of limitless. It isn't in practice because it will eat into your margin, and you have to risk control even if there are no margin limits. However, earning an 8% discount in what could be a matter of weeks or a few months is a fantastic return with almost no capital down. Second, the long/short position adds almost no volatility to your portfolio. This depends on the specifics of the exact trade. In practice, very little volatility will be added to your portfolio while you do add significant returns. Adding a lot of return and no volatility is beautiful to hedge funds and professional traders. If you have building blocks like that in your portfolio, it allows you to maintain risk elsewhere. You can take any beta you like elsewhere. You don't have to take this exact beta. The bottom line is that for professional arbs; it is very unattractive to go long the underlying outright. I think many will have hedged themselves through various means. When GBTC funds are finally freed up, this doesn't cause them to be net sellers. They are buying as much as they're selling. Their activity will essentially be neutral. Furthermore, some funds/institutions have undoubtedly used Grayscale as their preferred source of Bitcoin exposure. They're just long. But they have chosen to be long Bitcoin. Sure, they may decide to own Bitcoin differently. If six Bitcoin ETFs are coming to market, they may select another one or spread their allocation. But this shouldn't impact the price of Bitcoin either. Why would they suddenly start unloading Bitcoin just as many more institutional and retail investors get access to the space? Then there is the Mt. Gox argument. This is the bankruptcy estate of what was, once upon a time, the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world. FTX 1.0 if you will. First of all, Mt. Gox trustee holds 137890.981186 BTC on all known addresses. The total amount held by the Mt. Gox trustee amounts to around two days of Bitcoin volume. Data by YCharts I think it will be a drawn-out process for the Japanese trustee to send these Bitcoins to the original owners. Returning these funds to its owners will take a lot of time. I don't think it will be a 1-day batch and be done with it. Second, the recipients are primarily early-day crypto investors and didn't sell their claims at any time before. They may like the exposure. Third, the narrative around Bitcoin is pretty bullish, which may increase the likelihood they don't liquidate their assets. If the Mt. Gox selling temporarily pushes the market down, it may be a buying opportunity. Sellers want liquidity, and the market will provide it at a return. It will be clear that the wave of selling will be temporary. I genuinely feel uncomfortable when some asset I'm long has been surging upwards. To make things worse, Bitcoin's implied volatility has been picking up lately. That's not always a great sign for things to come. At the same time, several firms are in the race to launch ETFs. All these ETFs will likely be pre-seeded. Just think about it. When many people pick an ETF, they google ""best gold ETF"" or ""lowest fee cybersecurity ETF"" or something like that. They look at the list of the available ETFs. If they are longer-term traders or investors, they may compare costs and do some other applicable due diligence. Shorter-term traders may opt for the largest one because of the liquidity. In terms of options markets, often only the largest ETF has a lot of volume. Volume begets volume in ETFs. All these firms compete hard to get one across the finish line first. That's why GBTC wants to convert a high-fee product with an eternal lock-up into a lower-fee product with constant exit liquidity. It is the race to become the $100 billion or $200 billion Bitcoin ETF. Will these firms put $10 - $20 or $100 - $200 million in these ETFs? I'd think so. Perhaps they will hedge that risk with futures, but I'm unsure. There's some support out of this corner even ahead of the launches. I still believe that getting an ETF approved will catalyze additional flows into Bitcoin. I also think the halving is a natural tailwind. Finally, we're going into a holiday season with bullish, solid crypto narratives and matching price action. It is a simple indicator, but the ETF trades well above its moving averages, which is a positive and something many traders keep an eye on. It could end up a year with much crypto talk at the dinner table. Data by YCharts While the potential impacts of the Mt. Gox repayment and the conversion of Grayscale into an ETF present potential bearish considerations for investors, I doubt these factors will do more than stall Bitcoin's ascent. The upcoming Bitcoin halving and the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs are pivotal fundamental events that are likely helping to drive the current price ascend. As we approach and go through the holiday season with bullish, solid narratives for crypto, it seems fitting to me to hold on, even if Bitcoin surges a little faster and harder than I think is ideal.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4655140-proshares-bitcoin-strategy-etf-why-to-hold?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20888788.jpeg

Polygon Whales Have Increased Their Holdings Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a post on X, MATIC whales have made a decent amount of buys during the past week. The relevant indicator here is the “Supply Distribution,” which keeps track of the total amount of Polygon that the different holder groups are carrying in their wallets right now. In the context of the current topic, the whales are the ones of interest and their group address balance range may be defined as 10 million to 100 million MATIC (which converts to about $7.7 million to $77 million at the current exchange rate).

As such, their movements can often be worth keeping an eye on, as they may end up having an influence on the asset’s value. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Polygon Supply Distribution specifically for these humongous holders over the past month: The value of the metric seems to have gone up in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the indicator’s value for the Polygon whales has registered a notable uplift during the past week. In total, these large investors have scooped up more than 120 million MATIC (approximately $92.5 million) in this window. These buys from the whales have come while the cryptocurrency’s price has been trading around its lows following a sharp pullback from just under the $1 level. Naturally, this accumulation could be a positive sign for the asset’s future, as it suggests that the whales believe the current prices are low enough to gamble more on. While this may be so, though, another signal has also been brewing for Polygon recently and this one’s not quite as optimistic. As another analyst has explained in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the MATIC exchange reserve has observed a considerable rise recently, as the below chart shows. Looks like the indicator has continued to rise recently | Source: CryptoQuant The “exchange reserve” here is an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of Polygon that’s currently being stored in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. From the chart, it’s apparent that the metric started rising shortly after the recent rally in the asset took place, implying that investors began making net deposits. One of the main reasons why investors would transfer their coins to the exchanges is for selling purposes, so it’s likely that these deposits were coming from those looking to cash in on the profit-taking opportunity. Related Reading: Dogecoin To Double Its Price If This Barrier Breaks, Analyst Predicts This isn’t particularly egregious behavior, but the worrying fact may be that the exchange reserve has only continued to rise even after the asset has observed a significant downtrend from the top, meaning that the selling pressure isn’t slowing down. The whale accumulation is a bullish sign for Polygon, but so long as these exchange inflows continue, it’s perhaps unlikely that the price would feel any benefit in the short term.

20887867,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563174,1701352827,"Bitcoin 65% Crash Possible? $54 Million In Buy Orders Pile Up At $12,000","Bitcoin is still trending at a reasonably high price, especially after falling below $15,000 in 2022 following the FTX collapse. Given its rise since then, investors have turned bullish, expecting the start of another bull market. However, not all investors have bought into this bullish narrative for Bitcoin and this is evidenced by the amount of buy orders sitting at prices more than 65% below its current value. 4,500 BTC Bids At $12,000 In an interesting turn of events, a developer has revealed a massive buy wall waiting in the expectation that the Bitcoin price will crash further. One X (formerly Twitter) user who goes by @tedstalksmacro took to the social media platform to reveal the massive buy wall. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Identifies 3 Key Factors That Will Trigger Parabolic Move According to the post, there were 4,500 BTC bids waiting at around 65% below the current price of Bitcoin. These Bitcoin bids came out to a total of $54 million, going by the asset’s price at the time, and made up the largest buy wall at any price point for the cryptocurrency. Source: X These 4,500 BTC bids at the $12,000 mark suggest that these Bitcoin investors expect the price to keep falling. Now, if the Bitcoin price were to return to this level, it would mean an approximately 68% drop from the tight range of $37,500 to $38,000 that the price has been trading at. Another X user pointed out that the buy wall did not recently appear. Rather, the 4,500 BTC bids have been standing for more than a year. BTC struggles to hold $37,700 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Why Investors Are Expecting Bitcoin To Fall In response to Ted’s post, another X user, Luke Broyles, took to the platform to explain why there are so many bids for Bitcoin at $12,000. According to Broyles, the bids are a result of a “big unit bias level” that investors developed during the FTX crash. When the crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy in 2022 and the Bitcoin price dropped to $15,000, the calls for a decline to $12,000 had intensified. But of course, that never happened. However, not all investors have let go of the belief that this could still happen. Related Reading: The Other Side Of The Bitcoin: Analyst Highlights What Happens If Bulls Fail Broyles explains that “many people have either $10k or $25k saved up which would’ve made a nice comfy amount of coins at $12k.” Further adding that “Buying 2 coins at $12k sounded better than buying 1.5 in low teens.” The crypto enthusiast posits that the market has already moved beyond this level, although some people have yet to accept it. “Lots of people still waiting for $12k… still yet to accept market has been reversing for over a year now,” Broyles concludes.

Grove will use the funding to form new partnerships that advance DePIN toward mainstream adoption, according to an emailed statement shared with CoinDesk on Thursday.  DePIN refers to the use of blockchain technology and token incentives to build physical infrastructure networks so other projects don't need to incur the costs of buying and running their own equipment. In this sense, it can be seen as a decentralized version of Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud.  Grove provides Web3 infrastructure for building products and services atop its POKT network, which supports over 40 different chains.

AntPool said it would verify the identity of the sender if they sign an on-chain message via another bitcoin transaction using the same message – which will prove ownership.  Last Thursday, AntPool received the standard 6.25 bitcoin (BTC) as well as 85.2163 BTC in fees for all transactions included in that erroneous transaction, on-chain data shows.

42409309,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGJHZ,1701349260,First Mover Americas: Demand for Bitcoin Futures ETF BITO Ramps Up,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  ProShares’ Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) – a bitcoin futures fund offered in the U.S. – hit a high of $1.47 billion in assets under management this week, surging past a record set in December 2021. The increase indicates renewed institutional demand for bitcoin (BTC) as a flurry of bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications were filed in the U.S. BITO, listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), allows investors to gain exposure to bitcoin-linked returns through a regulated product. “Investor demand for BITO remains strong, as shown by the ETF reaching a new high in assets under management,” Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares, said in a statement to CoinDesk. “We believe this speaks to the demand for a familiar, accessible and regulated way to target the returns of bitcoin.”  Grayscale, the manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), is updating the trust’s agreement for the first time since 2018, according to a Wednesday filing. The aim is to optimize GBTC’s structure for an anticipated change to a spot bitcoin ETF and level the playing field when it comes to other applicants including asset-management giant BlackRock. The update, which will be put out for a shareholder vote, involves two proposed modifications to the trust agreement. The first allows fees, which had been collected by Grayscale on a monthly basis, to be payable daily. This is a structural tweak and not part of a fee reduction – something Grayscale has committed to, but which has not been finalized – a company spokeswoman said.  Cathie Wood's investment management firm ARK Invest sold a further $5 million worth of Coinbase (COIN) stock on Wednesday while buying $2 million of shares in trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) and $1.5 million of online bank SoFi Technologies (SOFI). The sale of 38,668 COIN shares from the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) follows the offload of 43,956 shares on Monday. COIN was largely static on Wednesday, closing down 0.35% at $127.82. The HOOD purchase was ARK's seventh of the month, and coincides with Robinhood starting to offer stocks trading in the U.K., its third attempt at international expansion. ARK has spent some $13.5 million on Robinhood this month, based on closing prices. The shares rose 3.24% to $8.92 on Wednesday.

42409295,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGIhC,1701347632,The Benefits of Building Apps On-Chain,"It sometimes feels like there’s an aversion to embedding elements of crypto into otherwise more traditional types of consumer applications. After all, why should something like a movie ticket live on-chain when millions of people already buy movie tickets as is? Or so the logic goes.  This is short-term thinking.  The real unlock lies in the long-term capabilities created from the buildups of data that aggregate on-chain. Traditional-looking apps with select elements of data or resources on-chain create the ability to see patterns of user across both time and applications. These are new information networks that not only don’t but can’t exist in Web2.  My hypothesis is that these information networks, or ""metagraphs,"" will expand the design space for engaging and exciting consumers.  Alana Levin is an Investment Partner at Variant, where she focuses on infrastructure.  Blockchains as metagraphs  A straightforward way to envision a blockchain is as an open, permissionless database. Users interact with applications via wallets, which live above the data layer on-chain. I’ve always thought of wallets as loosely analogous to cars, transporting users from one destination to another (where each “destination” is an app). As such, wallets also provide identifiers for one’s interactions across different blockchain-based applications.  See also: Coinbase Starts 'Wallet as a Service' So Companies Can Build Their Own Apps  The result is that the blockchain itself becomes an information network. By having a unified identifier for a unique user’s activity across applications, developers can start to construct and leverage more holistic views of user behaviors. These metagraphs are useful for segmenting customer behaviors, identifying superusers and facilitating more meaningful connections.  An example might help put the value of these metagraphs in context. Consider the relationship between a musician and two of their fans:  Fan A: listens to that artist’s music on Spotify for five hours a week, likes every single one of their Instagram photos, subscribes to their newsletter, collects the albums on vinyl, buys their merch and attends their concerts whenever they’re in town.  Fan B: listens to that artist’s music for 10 hours a week on Spotify but doesn’t do any of the other things.  Which fan is more of a superfan? Clearly it's Fan A. However, most consumer behaviors are untraceable, and so depending on the data the musician can see, they may unwittingly value the second fan more — after all, Fan B listened to their music 2x more than Fan A.  Don’t believe this is a real pain point? Say that the musician is Taylor Swift, and both Fan A and B really want to be whitelisted for early access to ticket sales for her next tour. Based on Spotify data alone, Fan B would likely receive priority. A painful result for Fan A and an unoptimized outcome for Taylor.  Blockchains change this dynamic. Putting information and activity on-chain expands the surface area for how applications, creators and consumers may think about patterns of behavior. Many of the components in the musician example could easily involve (minimally invasive) on-chain elements:  Subscribe to a newsletter via Mirror, with on-chain provenance of that subscription  Like/collect social media posts on Lens (or maybe one day Farcaster?)  Buy merch or vinyls that have digital twins on-chain  Collect a record on Sound.xyz  Each ticket itself could be a non-fungible token (NFT)  Scan a QR code live while at a concert to mint a proof-of-attendance NFT  In isolation, each of these may not seem like material improvements in consumer applications.  The question shouldn’t be whether blockchains are necessary, but rather whether they’re helpful  The aggregate metagraph, however, is a new social mapping — and that is what’s meaningful. Build a new road connecting two towns, and someone might not find it meaningful. Build a new highway system though, where each new road may not represent a significant incremental impact but the system in aggregate creates new connections, and you’ve built something powerful.  Expanding the metagraph: Time as a new element  If activity across applications is one form of how metagraphs expand context, user behavior over time is another. Every action on-chain is timestamped, which means third-party developers can tie together things that happened at certain dates/times, regardless of whether those actions occurred within their specific applications.  This is a step-function improvement in creating compelling products. References to personal history can produce compelling emotional ties between a user and an application. But within Web2, time as a dimension has been gated to incumbent apps: the data is siloed, so apps can only reference behaviors that existed within their app.  These emotional ties are powerful retention levers. Case in point: I still use Snapchat, despite not having sent an actual Snapchat in years, because I enjoy the “on this day five years ago” type of reminders and the nostalgic feelings they evoke. The longer an app has been around, the greater its ability to embed time into the product.  The problem is that new applications can’t tap into such elements of time. To date, the only way to create an “on this day five years ago” type of notification is if the app has been around for at least five years. This is not a favorable environment for new apps, which may explain why we haven’t seen many new consumer apps take off in recent years.  Web3 changes this dynamic. By encouraging activity to live on-chain, it democratizes access to information.  See also: It's Time for Web3 Games to Embrace Play AND Earn | Opinion  The ability to tap into global contextual information expands the design space for builders to remix and reimagine consumer experiences around specific points in time. One of my favorite examples would be an app built entirely around recreating “2015 vibes” — with an interface and content feed tailored to the types of songs, writing and media an individual consumed during 2015.  It’s like taking a nostalgic playlist on Spotify and making the experience 10x more immersive by enriching the interface with other media relevant to you from that time period. And because this data isn’t gated by outrageously expensive APIs, the app developers can build it with relatively low overhead. Phrased differently, the idea doesn’t need to be venture-scale to deliver a delightful experience.  Why does this matter?  It’s very possible that some breakout Web3 applications may look largely indistinguishable from Web2 in the short term — with crypto elements simply living under the hood—and that the true “aha” moments will come years down the road. An idea only needs to be modified by 3% to create something entirely new. Putting select elements on-chain may be that 3%: it creates optionality around what else can be built that leverages that data.  The challenge is that it’s rarely obvious what those products or features are, at least in the short term. As a result, some may write off the benefits of fostering such open access. I think this is a mistake. Open access to data facilitates experimentation and, in turn, creates a market of developers building with the broadest set of ideas.  Moreover, the most interesting metagraphs likely rely on identifying patterns across many applications and time periods.  My guess is there will be a point at which the richness and breadth of data on-chain will hit an inflection point. Thus, while some applications may look skeuomorphic today because at the surface they only innovate on a few degrees of the product, those three degrees can change the long-term trajectory entirely.  To be clear, there are also short-term, more single-player benefits to building on crypto rails. Crypto often offers cheaper and better payment infrastructure, especially if a product’s user base is globally distributed. The relative ease of creating secondary markets means areas that may suffer from traditionally wasteful resource consumption (e.g. unused airline tickets, reservations, etc.) can be made more efficient and unlock net new value. Attribution — and value attached to sources of distribution — may be easier to track and program on-chain.  See also: Decentralization, on a Spectrum | Opinion  But with each of these single-player examples, it’s important to note that the problem to be solved should never really be viewed as a “crypto” problem. Rather, the framing should be to use crypto as an enabling technology for whatever industry the application actually lives within: restaurants, entertainment, sports, content creation, etc. The most compelling short-term benefits are often best described relative to the context of each industry.  The point of this piece is to highlight what might be enabled when large parts of a broader system are rearchitected in an open and collaborative way — because that’s arguably less obvious, but just as important. We’re now at a point where crypto is becoming both easy and secure enough that using it under the hood adds little to no cost — and, at a minimum, opens a valuable call option for future product directions.  So if you’re building an app that leverages elements of crypto and someone asks “why does it have to be Web3?” send them this piece. Because the question shouldn’t be whether blockchains are necessary, but rather whether they’re helpful. It’s like asking if a car is necessary to get from one place to another 20 minutes away: it’s not necessary, but so long as the technology is safe and sufficiently inexpensive, it’s probably preferable.  The same is true of blockchains: so long the infrastructure continues to improve, the answer to “is it helpful to leverage blockchains?” will increasingly be yes.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX,Alana Levin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/30/the-benefits-of-building-apps-on-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd9379a8e27238a21ad4086f56c3d7ede60cdc07-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20884559,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563193,1701345650,Rare Signal Predicts Next XRP Price Move: Crypto Analyst,"The XRP price has been treading water in recent days. After XRP rose by more than 52% in just 18 days from mid-October to early November, the price is currently in a clear consolidation phase in the shorter time frames. However, a look at the 1-month chart of the XRP/USD trading pair shows that the XRP price has exhibited strong bullish months. In this sense, Crypto analyst Egrag has drawn attention to an extremely rare phenomenon in the XRP monthly price chart. The pattern in question is a series of three consecutive monthly green candles, which have only been documented twice in the history of the cryptocurrency. As the market approaches the monthly close today, a confirmation by a close above $0.5987 could mean the third monthly green candle for XRP. “Get ready—within the next [few] hours, we’re poised to seal another trio of consecutive green candles,” Egrag noted. Here’s What This Could Mean For XRP Price Delving into the specifics, Egrag elucidates two distinct historical precedents post such formations. In the first scenario, a 5-month consolidation phase was observed after XRP recorded three consecutive green candles from March to May 2017. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Identifies 3 Key Factors That Will Trigger Parabolic Move However, the consolidation phase had an extremely bullish effect. After it ended, the XRP price experienced a staggering 1,500% surge within just two months. Egrag suggests that if XRP’s price action were to emulate this historical pattern, investors can anticipate a potential surge to $10, starting from the 1st of April 2024. The second instance Egrag refers to the period from December 2015 to February 2016. During this time, the price rose by approximately 102% in three consecutive green months. What followed was a lengthier 12-month consolidation phase. But the wait was worth it again. In March 2018, the XRP price started an extraordinary 8,000% rally. A replication of this scenario would imply a potential skyrocketing of XRP’s price to $50, beginning on the 1st of November 2024. Notably, Egrag offers an average price target standing at $30. He stated, “XRP army stay steady, the average of these two targets lands at $30, you know that I always whisper to you my secret target of $27. Hallelujah, the anticipation is palpable!” Price Analysis: 1-Day Chart At press time, XRP was trading at $0.60333. A week ago, the price managed to break out of a downtrend channel. However, the bullish momentum quickly fizzled out after the price was rejected at the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.627. Related Reading: Bitcoin Decouples with XRP, BNB But Correlates With Dogecoin and Cardano For four days now, the XRP price has been squeezed into a tight range between the 20-day and 50-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average), with a breakout to the downside or upside getting closer and closer. In the event of an upside breakout, the price level at $0.627 would be decisive. Then, the price could tackle the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.688. However, if a breakout to the downside happens, a 100-day EMA at $0.575 would be the first support. This must hold to prevent the price from falling towards the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.552, which is also close to the 200-day EMA. The convergence of both indicators signifies a price level that the bulls must defend at all costs.

42409302,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGJ4L,1701345600,Polygon Gave DraftKings Multimillion-Dollar Edge in Special Staking Relationship,"Sports-betting company DraftKings publicly agreed in early 2022 to be a network validator that helped run the Polygon blockchain.  On-chain data shows Polygon gave DraftKings millions of MATIC to help its validator turn a massive profit with little precedent.  Even though it was being subsidized, DraftKings failed to maintain its validator's performance and was kicked off the network last month.  In early 2022, Polygon Labs announced an ""important adoption milestone"" for its tech infrastructure: DraftKings would begin running one of its network validators, ""marking the first time a major publicly-traded firm has taken an active role in blockchain governance.""  What Polygon neglected to disclose at the time: It would allow the sports-betting company to do this job on unusually lucrative and favorable terms.  Twenty months later, Polygon has foregone millions subsidizing a validator that's gone kaput.  CoinDesk reviewed dozens of on-chain records relating to Polygon's validator program to make sense of the companies' previously unreported financial setup, and interviewed former employees and validator operators familiar with Polygon's staking ecosystem.  Read more: What Is Staking?  On-chain data reveals that DraftKings received millions of dollars in crypto directly from Polygon at the start of their ""strategic blockchain agreement"" in October 2021. (It is unclear whether DraftKings paid Polygon for these initial 2.5 million MATIC tokens.) DraftKings then earned millions more through a special staking relationship that few of Polygon network's other validators enjoyed. Neither company disclosed these financial ties.  It's not unheard of for Web3 companies to pay mainstream brands to take part in their crypto ecosystems, be it through marketing partnerships or tech setups. But they balk at publicly discussing the treasure they spend to build this image of mainstream adoption. The on-chain data showing Polygon's special treatment of DraftKings provides a rare window into such an arrangement.  Representatives for Polygon and DraftKings declined to discuss the financing of the validator deal, citing confidentiality agreements.  DraftKings was not an ""equal community member"" among Polygon network's 100 validators, as one Polygon executive called it. Blockchain data show it received outsized compensation to take an ""active role in blockchain governance"" – and then didn't hold up its end of the bargain.  DraftKings' Polygon validator  Being a validator on Polygon's network comes with responsibilities. By design, only 100-odd entities – corporations, staking services, crypto exchanges and others – may lend their computing power to the network at once. They do the work of verifying transactions on the platform. The network rewards their efforts by automatically sending them Polygon's crypto, called MATIC. This is the key to the process known as staking.  Validators ""stake"" MATIC as collateral against their doing honest work. They can earn more MATIC rewards by staking more MATIC tokens. MATIC owners who don't run their own validators can ""delegate"" their tokens to others, who do. Most Polygon validators charge a 5%-10% commission on the rewards earned from these delegated tokens.  DraftKings' validator was different. It charged a 100% commission, meaning its dozen or so small-time delegators didn't get a single MATIC token as reward.  ""The whole point was to set and forget it,"" said Boris Mann, one such DraftKings delegator, who estimated he missed around $800 because he didn't realize the company took the whole staking reward as commission.  The DraftKings validator grew to be among the Polygon network's largest. Its biggest delegator was Polygon: The project had delegated 60 million MATIC tokens to help DraftKings earn more staking rewards.  Polygon apparently wasn't concerned with letting DraftKings eat its lunch – it seems that was kind of the point.  No money down for DraftKings  There's nothing unusual about Polygon Foundation – or any blockchain steward, really – delegating its native token to other validators, people familiar with the staking industry said.  By delegating tokens to validators, foundations can pay brand partners and reward network contributors without taking a direct hit to the balance sheet. The partners benefit from the staking payouts accrued to them by using delegated tokens; at the end of the day, the foundation can get those tokens back.  ""Foundations naturally have huge treasuries"" of their blockchains' native tokens, said Edouard Lavidalle, the co-founder of Stakin, a crypto staking company that runs a validator on Polygon. ""They need to stake these, and diversify this stake, while caring about performance and decentralization.""  But the size of the stake Polygon delegated to DraftKings, combined with the arrangement for DraftKings to take 100% of rewards, is highly unusual.  On Nov. 14 (a month after DraftKings' validator was removed from the network), a single Polygon Foundation-controlled wallet wielded nearly 13% of all MATIC being staked to the network. This wallet had spread 454 million tokens across 26 validators. Just over 50% of these tokens were with validators charging no commission – meaning Polygon got all the rewards. Most of the rest was with validators taking up to 10%. Just one validator (Stake Capital) with Polygon's MATIC charged 100%, and its delegated stake was a fraction the size of what DraftKings' was.  This chart shows how DraftKings' validator benefitted from MATIC tokens delegated by Polygon. It took a 100% commission on an unusually large tranche. (Chart by C. Spencer Beggs/CoinDesk)  For most of the last year, DraftKings' validator was staking 65.5 million MATIC tokens, 91% of which had been delegated to it by Polygon. Most of the rest was DraftKings' own MATIC: 3 million MATIC it earned from staking rewards, and 2.5 million it had staked at the beginning of the relationship in March 2022.  Blockchain data indicates DraftKings received this MATIC from Polygon Foundation in early October 2021. At the time, it was worth $3.2 million. Within weeks, the duo announced DraftKings would host a Polygon-based NFT marketplace. DraftKings also opened the door to running a validator.  When it did so five months later, DraftKings told its investors it would ""stake digital assets it holds in its treasury"" to earn rewards on the Polygon network. It did not say it had received those tokens from Polygon, nor did Polygon say it had sent any.  Special relationship  Polygon's undisclosed allocation to DraftKings – and its validator's near-complete reliance on Polygon – undercut the blockchain company's own characterizations about the validator being like all the others.  ""DraftKings will take its place among existing validators as an equal community member, solidifying our desire to achieve a decentralized, community-run consensus network,"" Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon, said in a press release on March 7, 2022.  The statement made no mention of Polygon's strategy to delegate millions of tokens to DraftKings. At that time, it had already earmarked 10 million MATIC for the validator; by the end of the relationship, that total had grown to 60 million MATIC.  From November 2022 until the validator's demise in mid-October 2023, DraftKings withdrew a total of 3.2 million MATIC, worth just over $2 million at current prices. It had amassed more in personal rewards than any other validator over that period. These rewards were possible only because of Polygon's massive delegation. Without those 60 million MATIC tokens, DraftKings might have earned only 4% of what it did, data from validator.info suggests.  DraftKings' earnings came at the expense of every other staker in Polygon's ecosystem. The network issues only a finite number of MATIC rewards to stakers annually. At least 80% of DraftKings' Polygon-delegated tokens came directly from the foundation, meaning they were not previously being staked. These newly delegated tokens diluted how much rewards everyone else could get.  Slouching toward irrelevance  It is unclear why DraftKings allowed its Polygon validator to fall into disrepair. But on-chain clues hint the companies' infrastructure relationship began to shift just over a year ago.  On Nov. 7, 2022, the entire crypto industry was on the cusp of chaos. Rumors were swirling of a massive financial hole at crypto exchange FTX. Within days, it would declare bankruptcy and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried would be arrested and later convicted of fraud.  By this point, DraftKings was rolling in MATIC rewards. In eight months, the validator's token stake had grown 120% to 5,578,691 MATIC ($6.3 million at the time). No other Polygon validator had earned that much for itself over that time. Then again, none of the other validators had been charging 100% commission on so many tokens delegated from Polygon.  DraftKings had been methodically staking its new MATIC rewards almost every day in order to compound the returns, according to data site validator.info. It did so one final time on Nov. 7, 2022. From then on, DraftKings has only opted to withdraw rewards.  DraftKings' validator kept on going for nearly a year until this September, when it began underperforming in its core job of checking the chain. It received a first strike, then a second; in early October, it got a ""final notice."" The self-policing network would soon boot DraftKings for failing to meet its requirements.  Polygon's separate NFT deal with DraftKings remains active.  On Oct. 19, Polygon kicked DraftKings out of the validator program and reassigned its slot to the crypto exchange Upbit. On Nov. 9, it moved its 60 million delegated MATIC tokens from DraftKings' defunct validator to a different one, with zero fees.  ""We are working with a third-party provider to have our validator node reinstated on the Polygon network adhering to standard procedures that all Polygon validators must follow. This will not impact our customers,"" a DraftKings employee close to the deal said.

Jelle provided a background for his knowledge as he stated these insights helped him sell his Bitcoin holdings at the peak of the last bull run. A Powerful Bull Market Indicator In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Jelle explained one of the “most powerful bull market indicators” that could help traders understand the direction of the market. This was based on how to use moving averages (MAs) for trade entries and exits. To enter trades, Jelle noted that he usually finds the confluence between MAs and horizontal levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holders Cross 5 Million, Catalyst For Price To Reach $0.1? The analyst shared a chart to elaborate his point further. According to him, there is usually a good entry when price retests an area that “makes sense both horizontally, and MA-wise.” This strategy is said to work well in the early stages of the bull market. However, he warned that traders will likely have to rely on MAs alone further into the bull market. Source: X He went on to give an insight into his Bitcoin trading strategy in particular. He said he uses the 21-week moving average when trading the flagship cryptocurrency. In relation to the lower timeframes and altcoins, Jelle mentioned that a combination of the 25, 50, and 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) works well. Finding Trade Exits For Assets Like Bitcoin Jelle also gave insights as to how to find trade exits. He noted that selling to MAs works well too and this is preferable when there is a confluence between the MAs and the horizontal levels. He also discovered that this strategy works best in downtrends. However, that was how he exited the Bitcoin market at its peak back in 2021. Source: X As to the best time to use MAs for exits and entries, Jelle stated that it works best when there is a strong trend present. Meanwhile, the strategy is said to be “much less accurate in a sideways market.” Although he decided not to go into details, he mentioned that mean reversion strategies are more successful during such conditions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETF: SEC Delays Fail To Stop BTC As Price Clears $38,000 Generally, Jelle believes MAs are a “great indicator in the trading toolbox.” However, he cautioned traders not to “blindly trade” when the price reaches an MA. Instead, they should also take a look at how the price reacts to the area. He gave an example of how wicks through an MA can tell one how “it is being respected.” Jelle had previously given insights as to how to buy the right dips in a bull market. His insights had also bordered on using Moving Averages to achieve this.

The surge indicates renewed institutional demand for bitcoin [BTC] from regulated and accredited investors, as a flurry of bitcoin spot ETF applications were filed in the U.S.  BITO, listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), allows investors to gain exposure to bitcoin-linked returns via a regulated product.  “Investor demand for BITO remains strong, as shown by the ETF reaching a new high in assets under management,” Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares, said in a statement to CoinDesk. “We believe this speaks to the demand for a familiar, accessible and regulated way to target the returns of bitcoin.”  “BITO’s average daily trading volume of $160M since inception puts it in the top 5% of all U.S. ETFs,” Hyman added.  Unlike some other bitcoin futures ETFs, BITO closely tracks the asset's spot prices, which has likely added to its allure among traders. In June, investors poured in more than $65 million in a single week, making it the largest inflow in a year and breaking a previous 2023 high of just over $40 million in April.  Bitcoin prices have rallied in the past several months as various investment giants, such as BlackRock (BLK) and Fidelity, are waiting for U.S. regulators to approve the offering of bitcoin spot ETF to clients – a move widely expected to drive buying pressure for the asset.

The rapid accumulation led to speculation it could be a new entity buying bitcoin, especially amid a flurry of spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings in the U.S.  On-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant told CoinDesk in a Thursday note that the address, bc1qchctnvmdva5z9vrpxkkxck64v7nmzdtyxsrq64, was a new one for the BitMEX exchange’s cold wallet, or a type of custody that isn’t connected to the internet.  A 566 BTC transfer was the biggest single transfer. The address appears on BitMEX’s latest proof-of-reserves holdings published on Nov. 28. CryptoQuant has previously labeled the sending addresses as belonging to BitMEX.  “This new address received the Bitcoin from a total of 450 addresses,” CryptoQuant said. “These addresses also appear on BitMEX’s Proof-of-Reserves report and have the characteristic bc1qmex prefix.”  BitMEX was probably conducting an internal transfer because it is migrating most of its bitcoin holdings from the 3BMEX format to addresses with format bc1qmex, the firm said. There are also Bitcoin addresses that start with “bc1q” that support SegWit, a type of bitcoin transaction, natively, allowing more efficient transactions that can pay lower fees.

ICOs are a method of fundraising, similar to initial public offerings (IPOs) that became popular shortly after the launch of Ethereum in 2015. Many of the most popular Web3 protocols got their start as ICOs, and while there was a ICO bust – because many were scams – during the 2017-2018 crypto winter, they turned out to be a good investment for many long-term holders.  The problem with ICOs, however, is that the majority, under current interpretations of the law, were flagrant violations of securities rules.  Hong Kong was a hotbed of ICO listings during their heyday, but regulators pushed hard to have exchanges de-list many of the tokens.  So-called ""legal"" ICOs, known as security token offerings (STO), which started around 2019-2020, weren't much of a hit with investors in Asia, as CoinDesk reported at the time.

42409308,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGJKs,1701338867,NFT Prices Are Still Lagging Behind Ether's Gains,"Ether, and crypto broadly, have posted gains of more than 10% since the start of the year, while NFT prices are trailing.  Stakeholders and analysts say utility and technological development are needed to bring growth  Crypto is inching toward bull-market territory, but non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have failed to benefit from the market euphoria.  While ether (ETH) is up approximately 70% year-to-date, NFT valuations aren't following. Nansen's NFT-500 index, which measures the valuation of the top 500 NFTs, has dropped 50% year-to-date when denominated in ether and 16% in dollar terms.  The Blue-Chip 10 index, which measures the valuations of the most prominent NFTs, such as CryptoPunks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club, is down 44% in ether terms, 1.7% in dollars.  OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, hasn't fared much better. At the height of NFT mania in January 2022, the platform was clearing $387.48 million in fees every month and $120.45 million in revenue, according to data from DeFiLlama. Now, fees have slumped to $6 million a month and revenue to $1.39 million.  ""NFTs have survived their first market cycle and have yet to take on a new jumping point in technology to usher in more user interest, like DeFi had with Uniswap's AMM,"" Nick Ruck, the COO of ContentFi, a decentralized IP-focused content financial ecosystem, said in an email interview. ""Many new innovations are still being built to increase the use cases of NFTs, but it's also partly due to the fact that NFT prices are generally negatively correlated with the USD price of ether.""  There are some signs of growth in the market, however, including a growing market of NFTs based on utility rather than monkey JPEGs, applying the technology to things like ticketing and loyalty programs.  Bitcoin ordinals also continue to grow in popularity, with miners appreciating the fees. Sora Ventures' Jason Fang attributed their success to them being a hub for the growing development of something similar to a layer-2 for the Bitcoin blockchain.  ""Bitcoin ordinals is not only a breakthrough for bitcoin utility, but also a hub that brings communities together,"" he said in an interview by email. ""Communities like Stacks, BSV, Rootstock, and even Starkware, which don't usually interact with each other, are all exploring ways to get involved and build on Ordinals Protocol – everyone found a common ground and wants a piece of it.""  David Mirzadeh, Ecosystem Finance Lead of Taiko, says this utility is also the narrative driving the NFT rebound.  “I see NFTs recovering some of the ground they have lost once they move beyond just speculative JPEGs to assets with utilities in areas such as games, music, and social,"" he said. ""Until then, their price performance will largely depend on speculative hype and mania.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/30/nft-prices-are-still-lagging-behind-ethers-gains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09b06443a6492ee40152e00c6d0c490a33407ebb-1398x722.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Nevertheless, the price did not manage to close the day above the important $38,000 mark. Shortly before the end of the day, the bears managed to push the price down again. As crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades remarked, “Market does its best to shake out everyone trying to pre-position for a possible Bitcoin ETF approval. It’s just free liquidity for the MMs/Whales. Sweep highs, trap longs, squeeze out longs, bait shorts, front run lows and repeat the whole process.” BlackRock Argues With SEC Over Details Of Spot Bitcoin ETF In a notable development, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has been again actively engaged in discussions with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concerning the structure of its spot ETF yesterday. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, revealed, “BlackRock met with the SEC’s Trading & Markets division again yesterday and presented them with a ‘revised’ in-kind model design based on Staff’s comments at their 11/20 meeting.” This revised model includes a notable change in the process, specifically at ‘Step 4’, which is the offshore entity market maker acquiring Bitcoin from Coinbase and then pre-paying in cash to the US registered broker dealer who is not allowed to touch BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes New Highs As Bloomberg Analyst Reiterates 90% Chance Of January ETF Approval James Seyffart, another Bloomberg analyst, highlighted the ongoing negotiations, adding, “More confirmation that Issuers are still meeting with the SEC. BlackRock/Nasdaq still pushing for In-Kind creation & redemption. Seems like SEC hasn’t budged on cash creates demands if this was the primary focus of the meeting. At least not before yesterday, Interesting days ahead!” The original “In-Kind Redemption” flow had Market Maker’s Broker/Dealer entity (MM-BD) placing an order for redemption through the Authorized Participant (AP), who approves the order, allowing MM-crypto to borrow Bitcoin (or cash) to sell short. This redemption flow had potential balance sheet impacts and risks that the SEC was concerned about. BlackRock has now proposed a “Revised In-Kind (‘Prepay Model’)” Redemption flow. This new model involves MM-crypto delivering cash to MM-BD instead of Bitcoin, and MM-BD then delivers ETF shares to the Transfer Agent via API. The Bitcoin custodian is instructed by the issuer to transfer Bitcoin to MM-crypto, who then closes the short position in BTC. Related Reading: The Other Side Of The Bitcoin: Analyst Highlights What Happens If Bulls Fail The benefits of this revised model are manifold. It aims to lower transaction costs and shifts the execution risks from investors to crypto market makers. It also claims to provide superior resistance to market manipulation and remove the need for issuers to finance or pre-fund sell trades. The reduction in risks of operating events and the simplification across the ecosystem could mean lower variance on how In-kind models can be executed versus cash models. 90% Odds Of Approval Remain Should the SEC approve this revised model, it could herald the introduction of the first US-based spot Bitcoin ETF, a significant milestone that would allow investors to gain direct exposure to Bitcoin rather than through derivative instruments like futures. Despite these developments, there remains a level of uncertainty surrounding the SEC’s stance on the matter, particularly regarding the implications of spot Bitcoin exposure for retail investors through an ETF. Recent leaks suggested the SEC might prefer cash creation processes over in-kind Bitcoin transfers, a move that could significantly alter the landscape for ETF issuers and broker-dealers dealing with Bitcoin. Nonetheless, Bloomberg’s ETF analysts have reiterated their 90% odds for a spot ETF approval by January 10 yesterday. At press time, BTC traded at $37,728.

Observing Bitcoin’s impressive resurgence throughout the current year, the bank identifies the onset of what they refer to as the ‘crypto spring.’ This period of renewed vitality in the cryptocurrency market has sparked optimism, leading Standard Chartered to set an ambitious target for Bitcoin’s future valuation. Related Reading: Is $20 On The Cards? LINK Price Rides High With Chainlink Staking v0.2 Rollout Bitcoin Surpasses $38,200, StanChart Predicts $100K By 2024 The world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, attracted interest from institutional investors once again this week, as its price surpassed $38,200 on November 29. Geoff Kendrick, Head of Crypto Research at Standard Chartered Bank, reiterated the company’s bullish forecast that the price of Bitcoin may reach $100,000 in 2024. The projection is a continuation of the bank’s April outlook for this year. The April research stated that a number of reasons that might propel Bicoin’s ascent over $100,000 are already in action, and that the crypto winter has now come to an end. The report emphasized that in March of this year, there was disruption in the financial system, which contributed to the “re-establishment” of Bitcoin’s use as a decentralized scarce digital currency. Bitcoin market cap currently at $740 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com Kendrick and the Standard team expressed their optimism that the US government’s approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs will be the next catalyst for the growth of cryptocurrencies, and that these developments will occur sooner than originally anticipated. “We think that a number of spot ETFs will now be approved in the first quarter of 2024 for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, setting the stage for institutional investment,” they said. Additionally, Standard Chartered highlighted another cause that can lead to future price increases: the upcoming Bitcoin “halving,” which would limit the currency’s supply and is expected to happen in late April 2024. BTC seven-day price action. Source: CoinMarketCap With its headquarters located in London, Standard Chartered caters to a global clientele of both individual and corporate customers. While it does not offer retail banking services in the United Kingdom, its multibillion-dollar operations across Asia, Africa, and the Middle East position it as one of the world’s most significant financial enterprises. And it’s because of this significant role in the global financial system that Standard Chartered’s positive prediction for bitcoin earlier this month is all the more intriguing. Record Hash Rate And Market Maturity Validate Standard’s Bullish Prediction Bitcoin’s hash rate, the amount of processing power miners are using to secure the network, and a measure of the network’s strength—which recently reached an all-time high—all support Standard Chartered’s bullish stance. BTC Price Volatility Trends compared to Mega Cap Stocks (data as of Nov. 2023). Source: IntoTheBlock Meanwhile, recent on-chain data from IntoTheBlock indicates that the Bitcoin market has displayed indications of increasing maturity and stability in comparison to large-cap stocks and index funds.

Standard Chartered’s forecast of a Bitcoin price surge has gained validation as Bitcoin has witnessed a remarkable 130 percent surge in 2023.

BTC’s dominance in the digital assets market remains robust, having increased from 45 percent in April to a current 50 percent share of the overall market cap. Bernstein analysts echoed Standard Chartered’s optimism, predicting that Bitcoin might reach $150,000 by mid-2025 for the same supply-related reasons.

BTC is consolidating above the 100 hourly SMA and might attempt another increase. Bitcoin is still facing heavy resistance near the $38,500 zone. The price is trading above $37,400 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $37,350 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could make another attempt to clear the $38,500 resistance unless it breaks below $37,350. Bitcoin Price Holds Support Bitcoin price remained well-bid above the $37,500 support zone. BTC climbed higher above the $38,000 level and made another attempt to clear the $38,400 resistance zone. However, the bulls failed to gain strength and the price peaked near $38,400.

A close above the $38,500 resistance might start a fresh rally. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The next key resistance could be near $39,200, above which BTC could climb toward the $39,500 level. Any more gains might send BTC toward the $40,000 resistance. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $38,400 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $37,550 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $36,721 swing low to the $38,390 high. The next major support is near $37,350 and the trend line. If there is a move below $37,350, there is a risk of more downsides.

20866649,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563105,1701307854,Empty Accounts Discovered As Celsius Allows Crypto Withdrawals For Eligible Users,"In a recent announcement, bankrupt crypto lender Celsius has initiated additional withdrawals for certain eligible custody users. However, it’s important to note that only specific custody assets are currently available for withdrawal, while other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) remain inaccessible. Starting November 29th, two groups, namely Class 6A General Custody Claims and Class 6B withdrawable custody claims, are eligible for withdrawals. Users within these groups have until February 28th to make their withdrawals. Qualifying users can withdraw 72.5% of their crypto, minus transaction fees, provided they did not participate in a previous custody settlement. Withdrawal Woes For Celsius Users In the November 29 announcement, Celsius urged users to withdraw these assets from the Celsius app immediately and to keep personal records of relevant information, as the app will only be accessible for a limited time. However, despite the withdrawal option, some Celsius users have experienced difficulties, according to reports on the X platform. This development comes as some 58,300 users hold approximately $210 million worth of assets that have been deemed “custodial assets” by the court. Related Reading: A Golden Opportunity For Ethereum? 600% Buy Signal Returns According to user responses to the Celsius announcement, there have been reports of login failures on the platform. Users claim to be experiencing errors even after attempting to reinstall the Celsius app. Additionally, some users have expressed concern that their Earn accounts are empty, further exacerbating the issues faced by former users of the crypto lending platform. One user specifically stated: While my frozen portfolio balance is visible, my custody balance shows 0. Transition To ‘Creditor-Owned’ Bitcoin Mining Company As reported by our sister website, Bitcoinist Celsius recently obtained approval from the bankruptcy court for its proposal to transition into a creditor-owned Bitcoin mining company. This plan involves repaying customers through a combination of crypto assets and stock in the newly established Bitcoin mining firm, which will be publicly listed. The distribution of assets is expected to commence in early 2024, pending endorsement from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, Celsius acknowledges the possibility of liquidation if the crypto-mining proposal fails to materialize. Related Reading: Chainlink Signal Resurfaces: Is Another 31% Rally Coming? Celsius and its founder and CEO, Alex Mashinsky, have faced legal action from various entities, including the SEC, Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), for alleged misleading practices. Celsius promptly settled with the FTC, agreeing to pay $4.7 billion once the bankruptcy proceedings concluded. Mashinsky has been charged with fraud; his criminal trial is scheduled this year. Overall, the resolution of the reported issues faced by Celsius users remains uncertain, including the login difficulties and accounts displaying zero balances. It is yet to be determined whether these occurrences are temporary or persistent and how the platform intends to address them. The future actions and measures Celsius took to rectify these concerns are still to be clarified. The lender’s native token, CEL, is trading at $0.2533, up 5% in the past 24 hours. However, it is important to note that the token has yet to recover from its 2022 decline and remains down more than 50% year-to-date.

Earlier this year, the Algorand Foundation branched into India with its initiative called AlgoBharat. The word Bharat represents the nation of India. At the time, Algorand partnered with Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) to support women-led enterprises building blockchain solutions and with Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University and the Indian School of Business to launch faculty development programs.  It will now build out the Web3 capabilities of youngsters under NASSCOM's FutureSkills Prime skilling hub and develop a blockchain-based credit scorecard and identity system for Mann Deshi Foundation's women entrepreneurs, Algorand Foundation's CEO Staci Warden and India Country Head Anil Kakani told CoinDesk in an interview.  ""In just a year, our strategic collaborations and innovative blockchain solutions with key players (in India) have pioneered financial inclusion, with the potential for impacting millions of lives in underserved communities,"" Warden said.  The blockchain protocol has also landed a new collaboration with TiE Bangalore, a global venture supporting entrepreneurs, to provide educational initiatives to support the Indian Web3 ecosystem.  Kakani said we are working on two types of partnerships – organizational to deepen India's Web3 foundation including broadening the developer base and then partnerships to build use cases.  ""We are not going to regulators with recommendations but we are waiting for (India's) central bank digital currency (CBDC) to happen,"" Kakani told CoinDesk. ""We want to see how we can build on that but as a protocol, our heavy focus is real-world utility.""  Algorand's earlier partnership with T-Hub to simply support startups will now include the launch of ""Startup Labs,"" a program that will offer mentorship for 20 Web3 startups. T-hub is a tech incubator led by the Telangana government, a state in south India.  With SEWA, Algorand has launched a pilot to help women earn high-value carbon credits through data it will collect via a blockchain-based solution.

While this pans out, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) remain mostly correlated with Bitcoin. XRP, BNB Decoupling From Bitcoin While rising de-correlation suggests that the market is maturing and becoming more sophisticated, secondary factors could make some of the top altcoins decouple and chart their courses away from the tight grasp of Bitcoin. Related Reading: XRP Community And Cardano Founder Engage In Heated Clash Sharing data from Kaiko, a blockchain analytics firm, @cryptobusy on X notes that the correlation between Bitcoin, XRP, and BNB has been contracting in the last two months. Meanwhile, BTC, Dogecoin, and Cardano prices have been moving in sync despite fundamental factors of each project impacting price action over this period. The drop in correlation indicates that altcoins are increasingly gaining more market share from Bitcoin. This drop in Bitcoin dominance happens especially whenever certain altcoins move independently and are not influenced by how Bitcoin trends. In most cases, like it has been the case in Q4 2023, a spike in Bitcoin prices triggers altcoin demand, lifting them as a result. Besides Cardano and Dogecoin, for instance, Solana (SOL) and Tron (TRX) are two altcoins that have been rallying and tracking Bitcoin. Additionally, the drop in correlation could mean the altcoin scene is maturing, and more investors are keen on picking out projects that offer more utility, not just BTC proxies. With more investors, altcoins tend to be more liquid, drawing even more capital. BNB, XRP, BTC Impacted By Fundamental Factors Even so, there could be more that explains the decoupling, especially with BNB and XRP. Seismic fundamental events have impacted BTC, XRP, and BNB ecosystems in the last two months. Related Reading: A Golden Opportunity For Ethereum? 600% Buy Signal Returns The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for instance, is likely to approve multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs filed by several heavyweights, including BlackRock and Fidelity, in the coming weeks. Hopes of the regulator authorizing these derivatives tracking spot BTC prices have catalyzed demand, lifting the coin to new 2023 highs. Meanwhile, a United States court ruled in favor of XRP being a utility when sold to retailers. The case initially forced prices higher, but the coin tracked lower throughout late Q3 2023 and 2024, only steadying as BTC rallied. At the same time, BNB was negatively impacted by Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, resigning in November 2023. The Department of Justice also fined Binance with a $4.3 billion penalty as a settlement.
