42399974,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzJ6S,1496951408,Libertarian Party Blasts Government Case Against Bitcoin Trader,"The US Libertarian Party sharply criticized the sentencing of a bitcoin trader on an unlawful money transmission charge this week.  In a statement, Nicholas Sarwark, who serves as chairman of the Libertarian National Committee, blasted the government's case against Randall Lord, who, along with his son Michael, was sentenced to a prison term late last month following an investigation into their alleged exchange activities.  As CoinDesk reported on 30th May, Randall and Michael Lord were sentenced to prison terms of 46 and 106 months, respectively. Both were charged with running an unlawful money transmission, while Michael Lord was also charged with conspiracy to distribute narcotics.  Sawark said the Libertarian Party ""vigorously condemns"" the case against Randall Lord, who previously ran as a Libertarian for a House of Representatives seat in Louisiana during elections in 2012 and 2014.  He argued:  ""Trading bitcoins is perfectly legal. Major retailers such as Microsoft, Expedia, Dell, Overstock, and Whole Foods accept bitcoins. Prosecutors targeted Lord for not being registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the US Treasury, and for not being licensed to operate as a money service business in his home state of Louisiana.""  Sawark, in his statement, later took aim at the broader political system.  ""The problem is overspending by federal politicians, their manipulation and regulation of currencies, and grandstanding prosecutors who get rewarded for convicting people rather than for achieving justice,"" he said.  He called for the sentencing to be overturned, asking supporters to “add your voice to ours in demanding freedom for Randall Lord”.  Lord's sentencing was a recent example of a trend of cases against bitcoin traders in the US. Similar cases have been pursued against traders in Michigan, New York and Arizona, among other states.

42399966,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzIzZ,1496942632,Chinese Regulators Expected to Release Bitcoin Exchange Rules This Month,"China’s central bank is reportedly expected to release new rules for bitcoin exchanges later this month.  According to a source quoted by Caixin, the People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC) investigations into the exchange ecosystem are complete, with regulations set to be put forward sometime in June.  The news, from 10th May, came just before China’s bitcoin exchange sector began processing digital currency withdrawals following a months-long freeze. That pause began following meetings between regulators in China and domestic exchange operators earlier this year.  Investigators reportedly drew issue with the fact that the platforms were providing financing and margin trading services to clients, according to Caixin, while further faulting the exchanges for their anti-money laundering systems. The withdrawal freezes from earlier this year were initiated as those markets moved to update those systems.  According to statements made previously by Xuedong Zhou, director of PBoC’s business management department, regulators are likely to ban the exchanges from providing leveraged trading, financing, and margin trading services. He also said that exchanges should not try to pump up the trading volume through waiving transaction fees.  Chinese regulators are also discussing possible regulations on initial coin offerings, or ICOs, according to a report review written by Yao Qian, director of PBoC’s digital currencies research department.  He wrote in May:  “Although the government is being tough on bitcoin, but in some sense, we should give a break to companies that has a top 10 market capitalization ICO market. We should give a chance to people to invest on these companies -- at least you could possibly be investing on some disruptive technology. It’s better than buying some stocks that are actually trash.  In the same review, he suggested that Chinese regulators to speed up the legislation for ICO regulations and to use a sandbox model.  Yao also discussed several plans including establishing ICO platforms like crowdfunding platforms, which will be responsible for educating the investors, reviewing ICO initiatives, disclosure of information, and anti-money laundering. Another model he discussed is adapting a venture capital management style and let professionals make the investment decisions.

42399976,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzJ8Q,1496941261,China's Banking Regulators Push for Blockchain Securities Rules,"The Chinese securities market needs new rules focused on blockchain in order to ward off potential risks, according to a new paper from the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC).  The paper  , published on 1st June and authored by CBRC staff members Liu Yuheng and Zhou Shaqi, suggested that Chinese regulators try to learn from their counterparts in the US and the UK as they look to develop new blockchain rules. While a footnote specified that the opinions in the paper do not represent the agency's official position, it nonetheless offers a window into its current line of thinking.  The agency – which functions under China's State Council – detailed several areas in which blockchain can help streamline the China securities market, including initial public offerings (IPOs), security deposit and transaction, and overall savings cost. At the same time, the authors highlighted what they believe are serious challenges given the tech's nascent stages of development.  The report said:  ""The innovation of blockchain application in the security market still needs to follow the theory and rule of thumb of the finance sector. The previous chaos of P2P lending in China explained well how a fast-developing technology can outpace the financial regulation and bring serious threat to the system.""  In addition, by referring to opinions from securities regulators the US, the commission said in the report that the central government should take lead in building up a blockchain industry standard instead of letting companies and organizations independently do so.  Citing recent moves from major central banks in the world, including the Bank of England joining the Hyperledger project and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority participating in distributed ledger consortium R3, the authors advocated for cross-border and industry collaboration.  The report's authors also called for the creation of a so-called ""regulatory sandbox"", in which startups and companies can develop and test new financial products in a limited setting.

42399987,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzJGI,1496931318,Charts: Bitcoin's Network is Objectively More Congested Than Ever,"This article highlights findings from CoinDesk Research's new Q1 2017 State of Blockchain report, focusing on data around the growth of bitcoin's blockchain.    Click here to download the slides as a PDF.    Born from math, bitcoin is a game of numbers.  Transactions have a size of ~500 bytes, blocks are limited to 1 MB and blocks can only be published after a puzzle is solved, a process that occurs via algorithm once every ~10 minutes.  The facts that underlie the current bitcoin protocol, set years before transactions could ever be called 'expensive', set the stage for the 'scaling debate' we've watched unfold ever since. Proposals have since developed to decrease transaction sizes, remove the block size limit and move transactions off of the main bitcoin blockchain, all in the name of boosting capacity.  Amid this indecision, the network itself has adapted.  As bitcoin miners can control the transactions they include in proposed blocks, and users can pay to have their transactions included, a fee market has developed to incentivize the inclusion of transactions into blocks.  Still, opinions on scaling solutions and alternate cryptocurrencies aside, objective data from the Q1 2017 tells a different story. Transaction numbers, block sizes and transaction fees on the bitcoin blockchain each reached all-time highs in the first quarter of 2017, proving the demand to use the network is now larger than ever.  Here's a closer look at the situation in three charts:  1. Nearly 300k transactions occurred on the bitcoin blockchain every day  Transactions on the bitcoin network have grown consistently since inception, and over 40% since a year ago.  Future growth however is limited due to bitcoin's current block size maximum and transaction size minimum, leading to a ceiling on the number of new transactions that can be added to its blockchain per day, one that bitcoin has now nearly reached.  2. Increased transactions lead bitcoin blocks to average 92% of their 1 MB capacity  Blocks have logically followed transactions to within bytes of their maximum capacity.  The pace has continued to increase as the year has progressed, and last month the daily average block size did not drop below 0.95 MB, leaving little to no room for transactions without considerable fees for miners.  3. Rising transaction volumes and block sizes lead fees to average over $.60 each  One of the aspects of the current state of bitcoin most dear to the community and the experience of any future user is transaction fees.  Not too many years ago, transactions on the bitcoin network were called 'free' or 'near free' and paying a fee was truly seen as optional. In the first quarter of 2017, however, average transaction fees grew 155% to $0.62, and began to rise at an increasing pace at quarter end.  On 7th June, fees averaged over $5.00.  Conclusion  Without a doubt, the bitcoin network is now more congested than ever.  Transaction numbers and block sizes are up against their limits and fees have reached unprecedented levels. As such, some of the major proposals are making an effort to mitigate user cost. Others argue that this is a sign of health and interest in the network.  While it's too soon to know which vision for the network will play out, the support, execution and timing of any action will markedly effect the future of transaction numbers, fees, decentralization, user growth, alternative blockchains and the entire industry.

42399968,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzJ3V,1496927804,Hewlett Packard Enterprise to Integrate R3's Corda Platform,"The startup behind the R3 consortium has partnered with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to integrate its enterprise-focused distributed ledger technology.  The move will see R3's Corda platform integrated with HPE's Mission Critical server services to deliver ""resiliency and scalability"" for enterprises bringing DLT applications into production, according to a statement.  ""HPE is excited to be adding DLT to its long history of innovation, so we can help customers meet the challenges they face as they grow and thrive,"" the company said of the integration.  HPE was formed two years ago after it split off from the main Hewlett Packard business, taking a more specific focus on providing IT services. The firm had previously partnered with R3 to develop a proof-of-concept built around Corda, which was unveiled last April.  Though the partnership represents HPE's first major foray into blockchain, the company is no stranger to the tech. Executives from the firm have spoken about the opportunities around applying it to its business practices, and in a Forbes op-ed from last November, the firm said that ""blockchain has the potential to reinvent the practice of business"".  In addition to the Corda integration, HPE has revealed it is planning to launch a client-facing ""Blockchain Discovery Workshop"".

42399977,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzJ9P,1496925011,New Chicago Blockchain Center Launches With Government Backing,"Several of Chicago’s largest enterprises have joined forces with the State of Illinois to formally launch a new blockchain center in the Windy City.  With partners that include the CME Group mercantile exchange, principal trading firm DRW and the State of Illinois, the Chicago Blockchain Center (CBC) was set up to help incubate local blockchain startups, mentor entrepreneurs and students, conduct original research and host a variety of events.  As part of the launch, the non-profit – founded by Bloq chairman and co-founder Matt Roszak – will be taking on the State of Illinois’ blockchain business liaison, Jennifer O'Rourke, as its first director of public engagement.  In interview, O'Rourke told CoinDesk:  ""With this partnership, the State of Illinois is directly connected to, and moreover responsible for, working with the blockchain community day to day to understand the needs of the community and meet them with bespoke programming and collaboration.""  Other founding partners include fintech trade association FinTEx Chicago, the Chamber of Digital Commerce, the Blockchain Education Network and Bloq.  While DRW is not well known in the blockchain industry, its wholly owned subsidiary, Cumberland Mining, rose to prominence in 2015 when it acquired at auction 27,000 bitcoins from the US Federal Marshalls auction of Silk Road assets.  Making connections  The CBC has evolved from an earlier incarnation founded in 2015, the Chicago Bitcoin Center, which was also founded by Roszak. One founding partner behind the Bitcoin Center, Bloq investor Tally Capital, has joined the new expanded operation as a strategic partner.  Other strategic partners include media startup Distributed and law firm Perkins Coie, which has a practice dedicated to serving blockchain startups and enterprises.  In addition to helping incubate startups, the public-private partnership is also intended to serve as a feeder of sorts between the region’s enterprises working to integrate blockchain and local industry startups.  ""Large, established companies will have the opportunity to tap into this dynamic ecosystem, which is already transforming their industries,"" said O'Rourke.  Shift in focus  Since the Bitcoin Center first launched two years ago, the State of Illinois has grown into a governmental leader in blockchain adoption.  Last November, the state first unveiled its blockchain policy, prompting a series of announcements including the February news that state legislator Michael Zalewski had called for the creation of a blockchain working lab. A month later, the state became the first US regulator to join the R3 blockchain consortium.  CBC founder Roszak positioned the center’s transition from a focus on cryptocurrencies to blockchain more generally as crucial to the diverse set of founding partners.  Roszak said:  ""We expect the CBC to prove to be a foundational component in the identification and maturation of the local distributed ledger technology talent pipeline.""

42399964,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzJ1X,1496921405,Bitcoin's 'Independence Day': Could Users Tip the Scales in the Scaling Debate?,"""V for Vendetta"" GIFs, ""Walking Dead"" references, images of tornadoes – even bitcoin's infamous 'BearWhale' has returned to welcome an approaching attempt to upgrade bitcoin.  While there have been many efforts aimed at improving the digital currency's protocol in recent years, few have attracted as fervent a following as bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 148.  Drafted in an effort to rally the community behind a process called a user-activated soft fork (UASF), the proposal is distinguished by being less reliant on gaining support from network miners. In fact, BIP 148 is the UASF with the shortest timeline to launch – and it's activating on the 1st August.  While some reject the growing support for BIP 148 as a kind of populist uprising, others believe it will lead to users having better control over the direction of the protocol. As per usual, opinions are split.  Because the change aims to circumvent what some consider a decision by miners not to signal support for Segregated Witness, a scaling solution preferred by Bitcoin Core developers, some have dubbed the upgrade date 'Bitcoin Independence Day'.  Alphonse Pace, a developer and supporter of BIP 148, told CoinDesk:  ""[T]here's no way to put it back in Pandora's box. The code is out; it's being run by economic nodes. Either we split on 1st August, or SegWit is activated.""  What we know and what we don't  So what does BIP 148 actually do?  BIP 148 is an atypical UASF in that it tries to encourage users to push miners to upgrade to the version of SegWit that some have been running as part of their bitcoin software since last November. By one measurehttp://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/segwit.html, more than 80% of bitcoin nodes are now ready for SegWit.  BIP 148's rules go into effect on 1st August, and by that date, miners have to show the network they're ready for SegWit by creating blocks with the version 'bit 1'. BIP 148-compatible nodes will reject blocks found by miners that do not signal the upgrade.  But it's hard to say what will happen after that.  If the majority of hash power signals its support, the full network is projected to follow that chain. If they don't, though, there's potential for a split, where there are two separate blockchains with two different transaction histories and two different tradeable bitcoin assets.  Some have already posted guides on preparing for the date, detailing how users can keep their funds safe in the event that this occurs.  Risks of a split  Given the potential for a network split, some are less than enthusiastic about the proposal.  For one, BIP 148 is more controversial than a 'traditional' UASF would be. Should users want to push through a protocol change, there may be safer ways to do so. This has led to a mixed reception from developers working on the open-source project, who have long sought to emphasize and promote user safety.  ""I personally don't support it,"" said Bitcoin Core contributor Jonas Schnelli, adding that the change likely won't be integrated into the Bitcoin Core codebase.  Schnelli indicated his support of a different proposal, stating:  ""BIP 149 seems to be the sane UASF.""  BIP 149 is also a UASF, but it differs from BIP 148 in that miners need to do less to remain a part of a network upgraded to Segregated Witness. Rather than signal for SegWit, they only have to avoid building on top of blocks that the network considers invalid.  BIP 149  would start after the current SegWit deployment times out in November, as some developers argue it's safer to wait until then before creating a new deployment that could be incompatible with old nodes. BIP 149 is tentatively scheduled for 4th July, 2018, though the timeline is still up for debate.  And, there are other concerns with BIP 148 as it stands today.  Developer Greg Slepak said the ""whole idea is idiotic given the lack of replay protection"", referencing a problem that played out last year when an ethereum software upgrade split the network in two. This led to a situation where coins could be spent on both chains.  Others argue that, while a UASF might be necessary at some point, now might not be the right time.  OpenBazaar's lead back-end developer, Chris Pacia, indicated he would only support a UASF if there was near-unanimous support beyond just miners.  ""But my read of the community at this point is that there isn't consensus on SegWit, and a UASF poses a real risk of creating a chain split,"" he said. The best way forward, according to Pacia, is Segwit2x – a more recent proposal that has support from most major bitcoin businesses and 80% of bitcoin miners.  Dangers in delay  To some, such as Pace, there's a risk also in waiting too long to activate SegWit.  He said:  ""Many have tried to say, 'We should do 149 instead of 148', and really it's the wrong question. Why wait for 149, which might never happen, when I could simply switch to litecoin, which has a community willing to stand for what it believes and has more functionality?""  Litecoin, a lesser-known cryptocurrency, has recently drawn attention for activating SegWit, a move that occurred after a closed-door meeting between network miners and developers.  Pace added that he believes that BIP 148 will find a lot of support.  ""I have a feeling a lot of people will underestimate [BIP 148], much like [ethereum classic], and will be caught unprepared,"" he continued. Many, including the original ethereum blockchain developers, expected ethereum classic, the old chain, to die off in the community's transition to a new blockchain last summer. It didn't, and now there are two competing tokens.  So far, 33 bitcoin companies have signaled support for BIP 148.  But what really matters in terms of pushing miners to support is whether the 'economic majority' supports it. In other words, major exchanges and wallets are key here, but many of the big players, such as Coinbase, Blockchain and Kraken, have yet to pledge loyalty to the effort.  Driving factor  Still, there are even more complexities.  Some claim a UASF, if done right, will have more of a psychological effect.  Shaolinfry, the pseudonymous developer who rekindled the idea of a UASF, argued that the mere prospect of a UASF is what pushed litecoin mining pools into supporting activation of SegWit. Similarly, some have argued, the same prospect of a UASF is what led so many mining pools to support Segwit2x.  And, still others think that now BIP 148 is going to happen, the safest option is for users to just go with it.  Bitcoin Core contributor Nicolas Dorier, for instance, argued those who do not run BIP 148 software are more at risk in the event of a split because of potential reorganizations.  ""I personally think that BIP 148 will work. I would have preferred [the] status quo, but the safest way for my services is to update to BIP 148,"" wrote Dorier, who works on QBit Ninja, an API for querying the blockchain.  However, it's unclear whether other bitcoin service providers will make the same decision. If they don't, though, Coinkite CEO and co-founder Novak Rodolfo said BIP 148 isn't the only option for those inclined to change the network's rules.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Support is really growing; there is a good chance [BIP 148] succeeds on 1st August. If it doesn't, then we have another chance with BIP 149.”  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of DCG, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase and Kraken.

42427596,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWbZh,1496917836,Virtual Currency in Washington State: What Changes in July,"Vic Lance is the founder and president of Lance Surety Bond Associates, and a graduate of Villanova University and the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.  In this opinion piece, Lance provides an overview of upcoming legal changes in Washington state that affect the virtual currency industry.      If you are trading virtual currencies such as bitcoin in the state of Washington, there are new rules you will have to adhere to as of next month. Virtual currency operators in Washington need to comply with new money transmitter laws starting 23rd July.  Introduced with Senate Bill 5031, the direction taken by Washington follows similar moves in New Hampshire and other states.  Online operators will now have to obtain a license and comply with the money transmitter bond requirement, but with the new legislation, Washington lawmakers are also reducing the differences in the legal framework that applies for more traditional money transmitters and for virtual currency operators.  Here are the most important changes that affect virtual currency operators in Washington, and how you can prepare to meet the new requirements.  Washington money transmitter laws now apply for virtual currency  With the passing of Senate Bill 5031, virtual currency operators are placed under the jurisdiction of Washington money transmitter laws. They need to comply with the same rules as traditional money transmitters. This means they have to get licensed with the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions.  The new bill provides a definition of virtual currency as a ""digital representation of value used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, but does not have legal tender status as recognized by the US government"".  Operators who store virtual currency are now also required to provide a third-party security audit of their data systems as a part of their licensing.  Virtual currency licensees need to make a special list of disclosures to their clients, which are included in the newly added Section 21 (2) of the bill. They must:  Clarify whether their products are insured and guaranteed for  Detail their liabilities  Note that transfers are irrevocable  Provide a list of fees and charges.  All money transmitters also need to comply with a new rule regarding license and trade names. If they a name is similar to an existing one, licensure can be denied.  Changes in the money transmitter bond requirements  Besides adding virtual currency operators to the laws governing money transmitters in Washington, the new bill brings changes to one of the licensing requirements. All transmitters will now have to post a money transmitter bond, and, unlike before, no other option will be available for fulfilling this security requirement.  The surety bond is an extra layer of protection for transmitters' customers. It guarantees their legal compliance. If they fail to follow applicable laws, affected parties can make a claim on the bond to receive a financial compensation for any damages.  The bond needs to be between $10,000 and $550,000. It is calculated on the basis of the transmitter's dollar volume and payment instrument’s dollar volume for the previous year. In exceptional cases, the bond amount may be increased up to $1m.  As earlier, the bond must be continuous and should be active for the whole period of the licensure. It should cover at least five years after the licensed transmitter has stopped operations in the state. The bond amount represents the maximum penal sum that can be paid to harmed parties on proven claims.  With the new bill, Washington currency exchangers will also need to post a surety bond as a part of the licensing. It should be between $10,000 and $50,000. Its amount is based on the dollar volume of currency exchange for the previous year.  What are your thoughts about the new Washington money transmitter laws that affect virtual currency operators?

42427609,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWbrh,1496912406,"At MoneyConf, An Unexpectedly Subdued Outlook for Blockchain","Over the din of 1,800 caffeinated entrepreneurs, financial incumbents and tech enthusiasts, MoneyConf 2017 showcased how cryptocurrencies and blockchain are steadily becoming an important part of the fintech scene.  One panel even went so far as to examine the question of how bitcoin will go mainstream, though responses were, perhaps, not as expected.  Jon Matonis, vice president of corporate strategy at nChain, said it already has – through gambling. He insists that this shouldn't be a surprise, though. After all, he reminded the audience, when PayPal went public, over 70% of its initial business was related to adult entertainment and online gaming.  He did concede, however, that that we haven't yet seen the scaling and the maturity that could make public blockchains ready for enterprise applications.  Holding patterns  His co-panelist Huy Nguyen Trieu, CEO of fintech consultancy The Disruptive Group, extended that argument to include private blockchains. He argued that while peak blockchain hype was last year, it will still be some time before we see blockchains in wide use in the financial industry.  Even once the technology is ready, he explained, internal processes need to be revamped, which can take years.  Nguyen Trieu went on to dismiss the disruption theory by pointing out that what is happening around blockchain in the financial sector is not disruptive at all.  He said:  ""We've lost the disruptive part of blockchain at the institutional level. That is coming much more from bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.""  However, he argued that the potential was still there. Blockchain architecture, he explained, is inspiring new design processes – this, he believes, will be the biggest impact in finance.  Matonis pointed out that a new vector of innovation was digital tokens, which ""totally transform investor rights"".  In another panel, Peter Smith – founder and CEO of bitcoin software startup Blockchain – agreed with that statement, stating that initial coin offerings (ICOs) were a ""500 to 1000-times improvement"" on how capital is raised.  Token sales also featured in an afternoon discussion between Matonis and Joseph Lubin, founder of ConsenSys, which highlighted how ethereum has escalated the speed at which ICOs are disrupting venture capital. Before, Lubin pointed out, developers would just fork the codebase, which has led to the current chaotic system of different-but-related blockchains.  Looking forward  Given that MoneyConf focuses on the financial applications of tomorrow, it's not surprising that more interest was shown in the potential of digital tokens than in the bitcoin price increase. What was unexpected, however, was the relatively subdued outlook for blockchain's impact on finance, as expressed by panel participants across the different sessions.  For instance, R3 CEO David Rutter ventured to predict that we will see digital ledger tech deployed this year, though mostly around end-of-day trade data. (While interesting, it's not the financial revolution many were hoping for.)  Matonis, while expressing short-term optimism, cautioned that the growth in ICOs is not sustainable.  And Peter Smith took the middle road by positing that the future would reveal some radical blockchain-based innovation in financial services, but that the incumbents would still be around.  Perhaps the most optimistic vision of the day came from ConsenSys' Lubin.  When asked if a consolidation in the distributed ledger sector was inevitable, he said:  ""I anticipate that there will be many, many different blockchain systems.""
