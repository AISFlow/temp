42403269,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfR5d,1568156441,Netherlands May Block Foreign Crypto Firms Under Anti-Money Laundering Laws,"Cryptocurrency entities based outside of the Netherlands may get the boot under new crypto regulations.  Following up a report by CoinDesk on the DNB’s recent registry mandate for cryptocurrency companies, DNB spokesperson Tobias Oudejans said the current legislation before the Dutch House of Representatives will not only force domestic companies to register with the central bank but that foreign entities will also not be allowed to conduct services within the country.  Foreign entities include all firms registered outside the of European Economic Zone, a block constituting most European countries.  When asked if foreign crypto companies will have to create offices within the Netherlands or Europe to gain access to the market, Oudejans gave no comment.  Oudejans said that the legislation, which addresses the fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD 5), is still under consideration. The central bank has already asked all Dutch crypto companies to register before the January 10 cut off date mandated by AMLD 5, however.  The legislation and central bank registration is based on anti-money laundering concerns. Like all financial firms, Oudejans said, crypto firms must register with the Dutch government. As a new industry, the regulations are very standard even if they seem draconian, he said.    Local crypto companies happy with regulation    A lack of clear regulation in the nascent Netherlands crypto market is an issue many Dutch crypto service providers are happy is being addressed, says one local crypto firm.  Crypto2Cash  founder PJ Datema told CoinDesk bad actors won't be able to live up to the DNB standards, helping mature the market with their exit.  ""It’s a really nice step. I'm not saying they are embracing crypto. [But] we are finally moving forward after a long period of silence,"" Datema said. ""It's good they are taking action. If we want the market to mature and the participants to evolve... you want anti-money laundering (AML) and proper know your customer (KYC),"" he continued.  How international--or even other European--firms will operate under the crypto laws being drafted has yet to be understood. Datema said the regulation is good for local companies and, from his interpretation, has the potential to block out competitors in Germany, France, and elsewhere.  For now, questions abound such as how the final legislation will look, how the DNB will enforce it, and how international players can operate within the Netherlands.  ""With one parliament in Brussel, you would assume you would role out one set of rules for Europe,"" Datema concluded.

In a blog post  , Blockstack co-founder Muneeb Ali wrote that the company's Reg A+ compliant token offering concluded on Sept. 9, and combined with a strategic investment round led by Hashkey Group and SNZ, raised a total of $23 million.  ""More than 4,500 individuals and entities participated in the 2019 token offerings,"" Ali wrote. ""Blockstack PBC has entered into agreements for more than $23M in these offerings (including both our SEC-qualified token offering and our offering to investors outside the United States made under Regulation S).""  According to a filing  in the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system, Blockstack specifically raised $15.5 million through the sale of 74.3 million Stacks tokens through its Reg A+ sale in the U.S., and another $7.6 million through the sale (and delayed delivery) of 30.6 million tokens through its Reg S offering in Asia.  The Reg A+ sale is further divided into two lots: it raised $10.9 million by selling 36.4 million tokens directly, and another $4.6 million from 37.9 million tokens sold through a voucher program. The company expects another $66,000 for tokens sold, whose payments have not yet arrived.  Blockstack announced its sale in July, after receiving SEC clearance to raise up to $28 million through its Reg A+ sale. The Stacks token, a utility token, will be used to pay developers on its Blockstack network, as well as by the token sale participants, Ali wrote.  ""Finally, our SEC-qualified offering opened the door to expand our App Mining program,"" he said, adding:  ""Through this program, we can start distributing Stacks (STX) tokens to developers who are building high-quality applications on the Blockstack network. Blockstack now has more than 250 apps on the network, most of them built in the last six months. The App Mining program plans to pay developers up to $1M STX by May 2020 and can potentially accelerate the growth of the Blockstack network.""

The bug was first made public on Aug. 30 by bitcoin and Lighting developer Rusty Russel and confirmed Tuesday afternoon by Olaoluwa Osuntokun, CTO of startup Lightning Labs.  It's unclear how much bitcoin, if any, was lost, or how many users were affected.  Multiple Lightning node versions are vulnerable and should be updated immediately, Osuntokun warned a developer mailing list, adding:  ""We've confirmed instances of the CVE being exploited in the wild.""  An experimental layer-two solution, Lightning aims to allow nearly costless transactions, making bitcoin feasible for mundane transactions such as coffee purchases.  But the bug shows the technology still has problems like any code-based financial product.  “Security issues have been found in various lightning projects which could cause loss of funds,” Russel said in the original posting. “Full details will be released in 4 weeks (2019-09-27), please upgrade well before then.”  Osuntokun emphasized that lightning is still in its infancy.  “We'd also like to remind the community that we still have limits in place on the network to mitigate widespread funds loss,"" he wrote, ""and please keep that in mind when putting funds onto the network at this early stage.”  Lightning Labs continued the warning on Twitter, reminding users that it's still possible to lose funds on the network.

42430969,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyn3h,1568145603,"WATCH: He Admitted to Faking Crypto Volumes, Then Got 5 New Clients","How do you get into the business of market manipulation? It's easy if you try.  Alexey Andryunin, a 20-year-old college student from Moscow, became a sensation after he quite openly told CoinDesk how his company was helping little-known token projects get traction via inflated trading volumes.  He spoke with CoinDesk about the business of market manipulation and explained why he believes the current market rules make manipulation inevitable. Now we have a full video interview with this token mastermind.  “I’m 20. I got into the crypto business when I was 18,"" he said. ""I was studying at the university, there were some problems in my family, let’s put it this way, and I needed money. I got an entry-level job at a crypto startup. The main part of my salary was in tokens, I trusted that startup, I knew absolutely nothing about the crypto industry.""  At that startup, Andryunin was in charge of listing tokens on exchanges and on CoinMarketCap. He soon realized he was in a tough spot.  “CoinMarketCap at the time required the daily volume as high as $100,000 to list a token, and those exchanges gave us pennies, absolutely nothing – like, $100, $200, $300 – and that was not so bad as it was right after our ICO,” he said.  The team realized they needed to fake it until they made it. So, Andryunin and his friend made their first trading bot.  “We would create a buy order from one account, a sell order form another account, they would meet inside of the spread where there were no other orders,"" he said.  The bot helped the startup get their token listed on larger exchanges and CoinMarketCap, but Alexey soon realized he and his friend could build their own business. One day, instead of his regular university volleyball training session, Alexey went to a crypto event in Moscow and met his first partner who helped create his company, Gotbit.  “Our product now is providing the full control over the token’s market: the volume, the price, the liquidity, and making money on the price movements,"" he said.  The clients were small token projects with an ICO. They wanted to calm their investors and look a bit better on exchanges. In a couple of years, Gotbit helped 28 projects look legitimate. It was not the only player on the field, Andryunin said:  “I think, there are about 100 companies, minimum, that can offer the market making services. They all advertise only inside of the community, you can’t come across an ad banner. Rather, you would get a message on LinkedIn, on Telegram, if your project has its own chat, somewhere else – this is how it usually happens.""  Next chapter  Andryunin is bearish on the market as a whole.  He said the industry itself created the market conditions in which the projects can’t get on the serious platforms without artificial volumes.  “In the crypto world, if a token is not on CoinMarketCap that project doesn’t exist, right? Without our service, or a service like ours, or without a real trading volume, which well-known projects can command, you can’t get on CoinMarketCap,"" he said, adding:  “It’s investors and those who believe in the crypto industry who are losing here. Because those serious institutional guys are afraid of entering it. But sooner or later, this all will get cleaned up, and personally, I’m for that, for getting it cleaned up and putting this to an end.”  And the end is near. Andryunin believes that the industry is getting more regulated: ICOs are now over, and new clients are hard to find.  The answer? Gotbit’s team is exploring other opportunities. However, he said he was happy to tell us about his “questionable” business in order to share a real story of how the market once was.  Said Andryunin:  “People should know the history of what has been going on. When the new rules for regulating the crypto exchanges come in place, people can learn from the shortcomings of now. I think our experience, the experience of our colleagues and clients, it can be a good example of what needs to be done to regulate this industry correctly.”  Alexey Andryunin image via CoinDesk video",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/10/watch-he-admitted-to-faking-crypto-volumes-then-got-5-new-clients,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/14b45fb157f7bdf13edc35d819cc9dc9e4a05aa5-1422x791.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430956,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMymhh,1568142907,You Can Now Buy Lightning-Powered Bitcoin With a Credit Card,"Payments startup Breez has unveiled a new feature allowing lightning-based bitcoin purchases directly from its mobile app.  The feature, made possible thanks to a partnership with fiat-to-crypto broker MoonPay, is available to users in 35 countries. According to the company, it simplifies the currently long-winded procedure for lightning payments.  A ""Layer 2"" payment protocol that operates on top of a blockchain, lightning is seen by many in the blockchain industry as solving bitcoin's scalability issues. But it remains experimental technology and users can potentially lose money during transactions due to undiscovered bugs, say security experts.  While buying lightning directly with a credit card sounds like a simple feature, Breez claims this functionality hasn’t been possible before now.  Breez CEO and co-founder Roy Sheinfeld told CoinDesk:  “Breez is not just a wallet. It's a lightning payment service that aims to provide a holistic experience. Breez’s goal is to take the lightning technology and infrastructure and expose it in an experience regular folks could use with compromising on the bitcoin values. Other [lightning] wallets are less UX focused.”  Previously, if users wanted to buy lightning, they would need to buy bitcoin, move that bitcoin to a wallet that supports lightning, then wait for that transaction to go through (the industry standard is to wait for roughly an hour to make sure the transaction is final). Buying lightning directly within a wallet allows them to skip a step.  Breez's new feature is part of a growing effort to make lightning payments less arcane for average folks.  “Going into a website and going through cumbersome process just to top up your wallet with a hundred bucks is not the UX we want to provide. We aim to provide a UX that is at least on-par with fiat,” Sheinfeld said.  Developers are still ironing out security problems with lightning — for example, by developing third party ""watchtowers"" that monitor for suspicious on-chain activity.  Breez doesn't require users to provide personal information for monthly purchases up to a total of 150 euro. But for amounts larger than that, it requires users to prove their identity under Know Your Customer (KYC) laws meant to outlaw money laundering and other criminal acts.

If allowed in executable code, the vulnerabilities disclosed to the Libra team could have been severe.  “The vulnerability in the Move IR compiler allows malicious actors to introduce executable code to their smart contracts disguised as inline comments,” OpenZeppelin’s CEO Demian Brener told CoinDesk.  He continued:  “The good news is that it was found and patched before the platform was live. Issues once thought of as benign can become more severe in the blockchain setting because auditability substitutes for trust.”  Founded in 2015, OpenZeppelin works with leading cryptocurrency, blockchain and internet enterprises including Coinbase, Brave browser and the Ethereum Foundation. The authors of Move work at Calibra, a subsidiary of Facebook focused on wallet development, and contributed the language to the non-profit Libra Association under a Creative Commons license.  Brener said the code was disclosed to Libra Aug. 6, with the Libra team evaluating and fixing the bug over the following month. As of Sept. 4, the patch was reviewed and confirmed to be fixed by OpenZeppelin.  Libra's stablecoin will have certain programmable features, such as the ability to make smart contracts. The full features of these smart contracts have yet to be disclosed.  Brener told CoinDesk the Libra team was highly responsive to the audits.  As larger protocols continue to develop in size and scope, Brener said audits are only growing in importance. Projects like Libra, with the potential for an international audience, require additional scrutiny, he said.  “We are seeing how huge and complex these systems are Libra is the first of many that are coming… and these systems go live and they manage millions of dollars by billions of people. It’s important to know what these complex systems are…people [need to be] aware of the potential.”  Earlier last month, Open Zeppelin concluded an audit on Compound, a decentralized finance protocol, which disclosed the ability to take out small, interest-free loans. Earlier today, it received an investment from Coinbase.

42430951,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMymZh,1568136940,Bakkt to Require $3.9K Down Payment on Bitcoin Futures Contracts,"Bakkt has officially revealed the initial deposits its customers will have to make to margin trade its bitcoin futures products.  In a new notice posted Tuesday, ICE Futures U.S. – the actual futures exchange Bakkt's contracts are trading on – announced the initial hedge and speculative requirements for customers, as well as its monthly rate add-ons.  John Todaro, director of research at TradeBlock, told CoinDesk that the initial margin requirements are “the amount of assets (collateral) that need to be pledged in order to open a position.”  According to Tuesday’s notice, customers will have a $3,900 deposit requirement for both Bakkt’s daily and monthly futures contracts as an initial hedge. The speculative initial requirements will be somewhat higher, at $4,290 each.  The initial hedge requirements are for accounts which already have exposure to bitcoin, Todaro said, adding:  ""Speculative requirements are for those accounts that are speculating on the price move on bitcoin through futures contracts. The CFTC and other regulating agencies have rules in place to protect futures markets from excessive speculation, which can lead to deviant price fluctuations, volatility, etc.""  Add-ons  Similarly to the initial hedge and speculation rates, Bakkt’s inter-month add-ons differ.  Both the monthly and daily futures contracts will have a $400-$1,000 hedge rate, but the speculative rate will fluctuate from $440-$1,100.  A footnote clarifies that the margin rate will vary depending on the expiration date and the ""difference in expiration dates of contracts.""  ""As contracts trade over time, there then becomes a maintenance requirement in order to keep your position open,"" Todaro said. ""Depending on market movements, this position may require you to allocate more funds to return the initial margin required.""  The notice also included an inter-commodity spread credit percentage rate, which Todaro explained relates to the credit ""available for offsetting positions in related instruments.""  With bitcoin currently trading around $10,000, Tuesday’s notice matches the predicted margin rates detailed in a FAQ Bakkt published last month, which noted that the initial margin was ""expected to be approximately 37 [percent] for outright contracts.""  While the FAQ said the spread was expected to range from $400 to $800, it did note that the ""ICUS risk department reserves the right to adjust the margin level based on market conditions.""  Upcoming launch  The notice comes less than two weeks before Bakkt is expected to launch its highly-anticipated futures contracts on Sept. 23.  When Bakkt was first announced in August 2018, the company said it would not support margin trading. However, the warehouse seemingly moved away from this position when it announced its September launch date last month.  Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler previously told CoinDesk that Bakkt's daily contract would be margined.  At the time, Loeffler did not say how much leverage would be available for the contracts.  The company's warehouse, which will actually hold customers' bitcoin, began accepting customer deposits on Sept. 6. The company has declined to share how much it has received to date or the wallet address for its holdings.  Tuesday's notice noted that the margin requirements were ""tentative.""

42430955,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMymXh,1568134809,Coinbase to Invest $2 Million USDC in DeFi Protocols Compound and dYdX,"Coinbase is putting money to work as part of a bid to grow the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.  Announced Tuesday, the US cryptocurrency exchange is investing 1 million USDC each in lending protocols Compound and dYdX. Called the ""USDC Bootstrap Fund,"" Coinbase says the new fund will support developers by ""investing USDC directly in the protocol.”  USDC is a dollar-pegged stablecoin launched last year by Coinbase in partnership with crypto finance startup Circle. According to data from Etherscan, there are currently $443 million USDC tokens in circulation.  Putting USDC tokens into DeFi protocols is a novel form of investment for the San Francisco-based startup. The move differs in important ways from the typical investments made by Coinbase Ventures, according to Coinbase product manager Nemil Dalal.  ""The USDC tokens we deposit cannot be used for items like salaries or user acquisition. It simply provides more liquidity in the protocol, making it easier to attract borrowers (for decentralized lending protocols) and takers (for decentralized exchanges),"" said Dalal, adding:  ""The USDC Bootstrap fund's goal is to make the supply side easier, allowing the protocol to grow.""  Doing so is mutually beneficial for both Coinbase and the participating DeFi platforms, according to dYdX Head of Operations Zhuoxun Yin.  ""It’s a totally different kind of investment,” said Yin. “They are supplying funds in a protocol to help bootstrap liquidity on that protocol and drive usage of USDC.”  Compound CEO Robert Leshner added that the USDC Bootstrap Fund can also be seen as “the starting point for the legitimization of open finance.”  “Coinbase is a financial institution and the fact that it's engaging with open financial applications is going to be seen as a rallying cry for other institutions to [do the same],"" said Leshner.  Other DeFi applications that want to integrate USDC for the first time or increase the asset’s liquidity on their platforms are encouraged to apply for the USDC Bootstrap Fund through an online form.  Risk on both sides  For Coinbase, the concern is with the security of the smart contracts on which DeFi sites rely. Yin said the Coinbase due diligence team did a thorough investigation of the dYdX code before committing to the $1 million USDC investment.  For dYdX, the concern is that major liquidity providers may choose to stop providing that liquidity.  “Any asset that gets added to dYdX is helping to collateralize the system as a whole,"" said Yin. ""There is some risk that USDC can be [withdrawn] at any point by Coinbase. So, there's risk on both sides. We're both comfortable that we're in this in good faith and we all take [user] security really seriously.""  Even so, Coinbase's Dalal emphasized that any investment through the USDC Bootstrap Fund should not be considered an endorsement of the DeFi protocol in question.  ""All investors in their protocols should conduct their own diligence before depositing tokens into a decentralized finance protocol,"" said Dalal.  That said, there is some immediate upside for Coinbase in investing USDC tokens on both Compound and dYdX: returns are promised to all users of these DeFi applications – including Coinbase.  The current interest rates on USDC accounts are 5.03 percent and 5.35 percent on Compound and dYdX, respectively.  Calling it a “prudent financial decision for Coinbase,” Leshner said USDC on Compound produces the second-highest earnings rate for users (DAI generates a 9.68 percent interest rate). Even so, those returns, according to Yin, are not the main motivation behind Coinbase's decision to launch the USDC Bootstrap Fund.  Yin said:  ""Any interest [Coinbase] can earn on the side is potentially helpful. But if you think about Coinbase's revenue, the earnings on interest is a drop in the ocean.""

As reported by Reuters on Tuesday, Mandelker said:  “Whether it’s bitcoin, Ethereum, Libra, our message is the same to all of these companies: anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism has to be built into your design from the get-go.""  Making her comments after a meeting on cryptocurrencies including Libra – which has its governing organization incorporated in Geneva – with representatives from the Swiss government, the Bank for International Settlements and other international financial organizations, Mandelker indicated she plans to meet Switzerland’s financial watchdog FINMA today.  The discussion will prioritize putting in place anti-money laundering safeguards as well as potential enforcement actions against projects in non-compliance with the rules, according to Reuters.  The digital asset industry has focused heavily on building its infrastructure and not enough on how to stop terrorists and other criminals using their networks to move value around, Mandelker argued.  The official also focused on Switzerland's growing role as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction, saying that, for nations taking that stance, ""it’s incumbent upon that country to take these particular concerns at the highest level [into] the utmost regard.”  While a Swiss central banker has previously said he is ""relaxed"" about the prospect of Libra's launch, and that Facebook seems “willing to play according to the rules,” the nation's privacy watchdog seem to be more concerned.  The Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner said in July that the social media giant had not responded to its request for more information on the safeguards that will be put in place to protect consumers, despite being based in the country.  Also on a visit to Switzerland in late August, Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), who also heads the House Financial Services Committee, said meetings left her with doubts over “allowing a large tech company to create a privately controlled, alternative global currency.”  Sigal Mandelkar image via Senator Jack Reed/YouTube",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/10/facebook-libra-other-cryptos-must-comply-with-us-rules-treasury-official,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6bb7d4a9d19b8c2953dd881c15ec3b762c68e960-1422x857.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430964,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMymxh,1568120446,CipherTrace Enters Race to Solve Crypto's FATF Compliance Headache,"CipherTrace has unveiled its answer to one of the thorniest questions now facing the cryptocurrency industry: how to securely share information about customers under new global regulatory guidelines.  On Tuesday, the blockchain security firm published its final white paper and open source software for wallet providers and crypto exchanges to comply with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s ""travel rule.""  The intergovernmental body dedicated to fighting money laundering and terrorism financing recommended in June that countries require exchanges and wallet providers to pass each other information about customers when transferring cryptocurrency.  This means that ""virtual asset service providers"" (VASPs) worldwide will have to hold sensitive personal information not only about their customers, but who their customers are transacting with.  Opponents of the recommendation  had claimed implementing such a rule would be ""onerous"" at best, but failed to sway FATF. Now, tech vendors are jockeying to offer solutions.  ""The industry itself has said it’s virtually impossible to adhere to the travel rule,"" CipherTrace chief marketing officer John Jefferies told CoinDesk. ""The reality is it can be done.""  CiperTrace’s Travel Rule Information Sharing Architecture (TRISA) would allow exchanges and wallet providers to share payment details and confidentially exchange customer know-your-customer (KYC) information, Jefferies said.  The reference implementation, a basic version of the software that others can modify, ""isn’t even that heavy,"" he said, meaning it won’t require much in the way of processing power. Much of the requirements are met once the exchanges establish they’re ""talking"" to the right counterparty.  ""While this rule may cause some consternation with respect to privacy because these exchanges are exchanging their data, they’re going to have to do that"" confidentially, Jefferies said. ""Assuming VASP A and VASP B need to share data, confidentiality is the most important"" part.  CipherTrace’s announcement comes a day after Netki announced it was updating its own digital identity service, to help firms comply with the FATF travel rule.  How it works  Exchanges adopting TRISA would essentially create an ""extended validation know-your-VASP"" certificate, which would be sent from the exchange originating a transaction to the one receiving it. These certificates would be verified through a third-party trusted certificate authority.  The exchanges receiving a transaction should in turn confirm that they did actually receive a transaction with a receipt (or otherwise send a receipt saying the exchange would reject the transaction, should a party be on a sanction or other black list).  According to the white paper, exchanges should also ensure they have secure and reliable communications set up between each other.  ""It’s much like websites, right? The whole architecture is identical to SSL,"" said Jefferies, referring to the secure sockets layer (SSL) protocol. ""It's not prohibitively expensive because half the sites use SSL.""  The company plans to let exchanges test the implementation for ""a little while"" to ensure it works as advertised. Any issues would be fixed by updating the open-source code, he explained.  Binance, currently the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, is examining CipherTrace’s code (though the exchange hasn’t yet committed to implementing it). A few other exchanges are supposedly also considering whether to implement the code, though Jefferies said he could not disclose the names.  FATF’s recommendations have yet to be formally adopted by most countries, so any exchange implementing travel rule compliance would be doing so proactively. Jefferies predicted that exchanges would either add the code as a possible boost over other exchanges or otherwise wait until ""it’s forced upon them.""  ""What we’re starting to see is compliance used as a competitive advantage,"" he said.  FinCEN stepping up?  While the ink is barely dry on the FATF recommendations, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) may be forcing exchanges to comply with the travel rule already.  FinCEN, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, published guidance in May imposing its own version of the travel rule.  The guidance, released May 9, gave exchanges 180 days to do so (meaning until Nov. 27).  Unlike FATF’s recommendations, exchanges are expected to immediately comply with FinCEN guidance, Jefferies said, adding:  ""The difference between FinCEN and FATF is FinCEN is a law, right? They have no choice.""  He told CoinDesk that FinCEN has already begun enforcement actions, though he did not provide any names. ""FinCEN is from my understanding actively taking action against people and VASPs in the U.S. who are not complying with the travel rule so we expect to see some disclosure of that in the not-so-distant future,"" according to Jefferies.  His comments echo Netki, which said in its announcement Monday that ""the U.S. FinCEN agency has begun enforcement actions against VASPs who are not in compliance.""  FinCEN has not announced any new enforcement actions in the crypto space since April. The agency did not reply to a request for comment.

The security token facilitator announced Tuesday that it had developed an administrative panel for transfer agents, essentially building a software tool to aid banks, trust companies and other third parties to more easily manage security token offerings on behalf of their issuers.  Mason Borda, CEO of TokenSoft, told CoinDesk that the company began working with transfer agents in 2018, finding that they had specific needs when it came to security token issuances due to regulatory requirements.  ""Any SEC-registered offering requires a transfer agent much like every security that’s trading publicly today has a transfer agent in the back,"" he said. ""So for registered offerings, we’re expecting the need for transfer agents to increase over time.""  Borda went on to explain:  ""They need to have administrative privileges over a token. For example, the ability to freeze a token to cover the case where someone might lose their keys, or where someone might pass away to transfer the token to the beneficial owner. So we’ve been building out a set of features where those can be met.""  TokenSoft is specifically offering its clients access to software tools that any transfer agent can use to manage securities issuances.  As a result, issuers or other clients who need transfer agents can work with their first choice. TokenSoft itself is not a transfer agent, though it will provide support for transfer agents using its tools.  Borda called support for transfer agents ""a key piece of infrastructure.""  Jeff Bandman, a former advisor to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), agreed. In terms of digital assets, transfer agents would be responsible for issues such as associating wallet addresses with user identities, said Bandman, who is now the CEO of one such transfer agent called BlockAgent.  Many digital assets are underpinned by smart contracts. Transfer agents can oversee these smart contracts to ensure they’re operating as intended, Bandman said.  Close control  TokenSoft CTO James Poole said the company’s new offering allows these transfer agents to verify identities, greenlight approved accredited investors and otherwise manage a security token offering.  The new tools would also allow transfer agents to burn and reissue tokens as needed.  Lawson Baker, head of operations and general counsel at TokenSoft, added that the new tools would also facilitate transfers from an original participant in a security token sale to a new buyer.  ""Let’s say James participated in the sale, but it’s a year later and he wants to sell to Lawson, this dashboard is what really allows that,"" he said.  The software, which includes role-based access controls, can allow transfer agents to pick between different rule sets (such as for a Regulation D offering or a Regulation S offering). Each set would be pre-configured by TokenSoft before the transfer agent would take control, Baker said, adding:  ""Whatever rules we put are set by the issuer and their counsel and we just configure it for their needs.""  BlockAgent is currently working to help an undisclosed issuer prepare for a security token offering in partnership with TokenSoft, he said.  ""We are working with TokenSoft in the context of a particular issuer who’s working on the issuance of digital securities,"" he said. ""TokenSoft is building the token itself, which includes smart contract functionality.""  BlockAgent, in its role as a transfer agent, would then have its own regulatory requirements to ensure that it can manage the tokens over the securities’ lifecycle.  Baker said that TokenSoft is currently working with roughly two or three such transfer agents in the U.S., though he noted that not all of TokenSoft’s customers would be using its tools.

CasperLabs anticipates issuing several ""interesting"" technical updates in the coming months, according to Mrinal Manohar co-founder and CEO of CasperLabs' parent firm ADAPtive Holdings.  “I’ve been following and studying the crypto and blockchain space since its earliest days, and I’ve been waiting for a company that can build the strength and decentralized aspects of a public chain with the speed, security, and scalability of a next-gen platform,” said lead investor Piezer, adding:  “Scalability of a product and company is the leading driver of value creation.

42430947,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMymVh,1568113234,Gemini Launches Custody Product With 18 Cryptos Including Ethereum Tokens,"The Gemini exchange is launching an institutional-grade crypto custody solution, according to an announcement Tuesday.  Through the Gemini Trust Company, a regulated custodian overseen by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), the Winklevoss-backed exchange now offers ""Gemini Custody,"" a platform which would enable clients to trade assets instantly by offering them credits.  Previously, clients would have to wait more than a day to access and trade assets. Gemini customers will be able to trade assets held offline without waiting to access them using the new system.  According to the release, customers can set up white lists, ensuring their crypto holdings can only be withdrawn to certain addresses; grant auditors access to confirm balances and activity; and set up different sub-accounts with different levels of permission as needed.  In a statement, Gemini managing director of operations Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto said Gemini Custody is a ""crypto-native solution"" which provides both security and liquidity for clients.  She continued:  ""Institutional investors have demonstrated a clear and growing demand for crypto, but they’ve struggled to find a solution that fully meets their complex regulatory and security requirements.""  As part of its security efforts, Gemini Custody allows for multi-signature offline storage, the release said.  The custodian, which already supported bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, litecoin and zcash, now provides support for 0z, Augur's REP tokens, the basic attention token (BAT), bread (BRD), dai, maker, decentraland's MANA token, enjin, flexacoin, the Gemini dollar, Kyber Network's token, Loom Network's token and OmiseGo.  Gemini plans to add support for other cryptocurrencies as well.  While many of the new ERC-20 tokens were not explicitly approved through the NYDFS, the New York financial regulator approved Gemini's Listing, Custody and Issuance Framework, according to a spokesperson. The ERC-20 tokens are being added in accordance with the framework.  Tuesday's launch is only the latest move in Gemini's efforts to provide regulated services to institutions.  The exchange announced in early July that it would file for a broker-dealer license through the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the self-regulatory organization overseeing securities dealers in the U.S. Should Gemini secure a broker-dealer approval, it would then be able to apply to become an alternative trading system, which would enable it to offer digital securities for approved traders.

42430971,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyn7h,1568113207,Bitcoin Consolidates Above $10.2K After Failed Price Breakout,"View  Bitcoin's hourly chart shows that yesterday's falling-wedge breakout failed, but the outlook remains neutral with prices holding well above key support at $10,060.  A break below $10,060 would strengthen the bearish setup on the daily chart and could yield a drop to $9,755 (Aug. 22 low).  The outlook would turn bullish if BTC invalidates the bearish lower-highs setup with a UTC close above $10,956 (Aug. 20 high).      Bitcoin (BTC) is lacking clear directional bias at press time, having failed to capitalize on a bullish breakout on Monday.  The top cryptocurrency has spent much of the last 20 hours trading the narrow range of $10,200–$10,400.  Prices dropped to a one-week low of $10,060 at 08:10 UTC yesterday, signaling a potential resumption of the sell-off from Friday's high of $10,950. The drop to the seven-day low was short-lived, though, and BTC rose well above $10,500 by 11:20 UTC, confirming a bullish breakout on the hourly chart.  The falling wedge breakout implied an end of the pullback from recent highs and a resumption of the rally from the Aug. 29 low of $9,320.  The bullish setup, however, failed to draw bids and prices fell back to $10,250 at 16:40 UTC, as seen in the chart below.  Hourly chart  The failed breakout has neutralized the bullish hourly chart setup.  Some observers consider failed breakouts as a warning of impending sell-off. So far, however, the downside has been restricted below $10,200.  The outlook will remain neutral as long as prices are holding above $10,060 – the low of the doji candle that applied the brakes on the sell-off yesterday and fueled a price bounce to levels above $10,500.  If prices break below $10,060, the bearish setup seen on the daily chart below would gain credence, possibly leading to a deeper drop to $9,750.  Daily chart  BTC fell from highs near $10,950 to $10,280 on Friday, engulfing the price action seen in the previous three trading days.  Essentially, Friday's sell-off marked a downside break of the consolidation, represented by Wednesday's spinning top candle and Thursday’s doji candle. The bear grip would further strengthen if the hourly chart support of $10,060 is breached.  The outlook would turn bullish if and when prices manage to print a UTC close above the bearish lower high of $10,956 created on Aug. 20.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,270 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.84 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  While BTC is wavering, ethereum's ether (ETH) cryptocurrency, the second-largest by market value, is better bid above $180 on Bitfinex.  ETH/USD daily chart  ETH jumped by 5.35 percent on Saturday, confirming a falling-wedge breakout – a bearish-to-bullish trend change. So far, the upside has been capped around $185.00.  However, the cryptocurrency produced a candle with long wicks yesterday, marking indecision in the market place. So now, $186 (Monday's high) is the level to beat for the bulls.  A UTC close above that level would add credence to the falling-wedge breakout and open the doors to $204 (Aug. 19 high).  On the downside, acceptance below $176 (Monday's low) will likely invite selling pressure, yielding a retest of the recent low of $164.

42430949,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMymbh,1568106028,Facebook Adds Singapore Dollar to Libra Crypto Basket: Report,"Details are emerging on which fiat currencies might back the Libra stablecoin.  Bloomberg reported Monday  that Facebook wrote a letter to U.S. Senators about Libra, addressing concerns over potential Chinese influence on the cryptocurrency. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) previously wrote to Facebook asking the company to exclude the Chinese yuan from the basket of assets backing the Libra stablecoin.  ""Any decision whether to add a new currency to the Libra Reserve would be made based on all the facts and circumstances at the time, including any direct or indirect regulatory restrictions,"" Facebook reportedly wrote, adding that the decision would be made by the Libra Association, not Facebook itself.  According to Bloomberg, Facebook provided a list of possible currencies to include in the Libra Reserve but appeared to stop short of saying that the yuan would be excluded outright.  The U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, British pound and the Singapore dollar were included in the letter.  David Marcus, Facebook's blockchain lead, previously told the U.S. House Financial Services Committee that 50 percent of the basket backing Libra would be U.S. dollars, with the other half in stable sovereign currencies and low-risk assets.  Controversial launch  Facebook first unveiled its vision for Libra this summer, announcing it would create two tokens: the fiat-backed stablecoin and a security token that members of Libra's governing council could use to oversee the network.  The project faced immediate pushback, with regulators in the U.S. and a number of other jurisdictions immediately calling for the company to halt development until lawmakers' questions could be answered.  Facebook's Marcus testified before the House Financial Services and Senate Banking committees in July, attempting to reassure lawmakers that the cryptocurrency wouldn't destabilize the global monetary system.  The company has pledged to continue developing the project, though it did say it would not launch until any regulatory concerns have been resolved.

42430963,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMymvh,1568098854,Little-Known Exchange Claims It Will Be First to Sell Telegram Tokens,"When Telegram launches its long-awaited blockchain sometime this month or next, the go-to marketplace for the new gram tokens could be a fledgling exchange with fewer than 4,000 users.  At least, that's what Blackmoon Crypto is hoping. But the Malta-registered exchange arguably has an edge, in part because of its relationship with a custodian that claims to have signed up over a third of the investors in Telegram’s early-2018 token sale.  Blackmoon's CEO, Oleg Seydak, is also the CEO of Gram Vault, the Swiss custodian, and the companies plan to work together to provide those large investors with a marketplace to sell their tokens.  Hence, unlike a number of exchanges that conducted sales of futures-like instruments based on grams, Blackmoon will be the only marketplace to sell real grams directly from legitimate investors as soon as the Telegram Open Network (TON) is live, said chief operating officer Sergey Vasin.  Vasin told CoinDesk:  “Exchanges that earlier announced selling grams actually listed some kinds of derivatives. We don’t mind that — at the end, they will have to look for liquidity to deliver what they promised to their users, and they will run to buy grams from us with a premium.""  Ties that bind  Another possible advantage for Blackmoon is its association with the secretive messaging app company behind the $1.7 billion TON project.  According to people familiar with the TON development and investment processes, Blackmoon is a part of a network of loosely affiliated entities working with Telegram on the infrastructure for the blockchain and token.  Alexander Filatov, СЕО of TON Labs, which is working on tools for TON developers, told CoinDesk that Gram Vault ""is working on the first-to-market custody solution for the gram with a number of reputable international partners.""  ""TON Labs are providing technical support for the project,"" Filatov added.  Further, Seydak is also CEO of a third company, Blackmoon Financial Group, which was co-founded by Ilya Perekopsky, the vice president of Telegram.  Blackmoon Crypto denies any direct link with Telegram, however.  ""Blackmoon crypto exchange has no relation to Ilya Perekopsky nor anyone else employed by Telegram,"" Seydak told CoinDesk by email. ""While we partnered with Ilya in other business ventures, I happen to be the exchange's sole shareholder and its General Manager. Blackmoon crypto exchange was founded in October 2018 without Ilya’s participation. The company has developed its own independent technical integration strategy of the new blockchain from Telegram. It doesn’t have, need nor plan to develop any affiliation with the Telegram team to pursue its targets.”  Modest beginnings  The affiliated company, Cyprus-based Blackmoon Financial Group, was founded in 2014 and started as a lending marketplace. In 2017, the crypto exchange was created, bootstrapped by a $30 million initial coin offering (ICO).  To date, Blackmoon Crypto has been an issuing and trading venue for ethereum tokens backed by shares in mainstream companies such as Xiaomi and Lyft. The underlying stock is held with the custodian, Vasin sID.  This business wasn’t exactly flourishing — according to Vasin, the platform now boasts only about 3,800 users. However, once the gram token is issued, Vasin expects the number to jump up to 15,000 in the days after the mainnet launch (the TON network is expected to be launched no later than Oct. 31).  “This estimate is based on the [number] of new sign-ups we got the day when the information was leaked,” Vasin explained, referring to an incident on Aug. 9, when a public relations staffer jumped the gun and published a press release about its plan to list grams earlier than planned. (Blackmoon formally announced the plan Tuesday.)  Vasin said Blackmoon is targeting both retail investors and sophisticated algorithmic traders who would come to the exchange for real gram liquidity.  Deep pockets  The liquidity would come from Gram Vault.  “Gram Vault is a joint venture between some of the biggest investors in the Telegram Open Network who invested over $600 million in both rounds of the deal,” said Alfredo Orrego, Gram Vault's chief business development officer, adding that the company originated out of the need for a compliant, institutional-grade custody solution for such clients.  Operating under the legal name Swiss Digital Group, Gram Vault exclusively serves investors who participated in the initial token sale, Orrego said. Describing the custodian's partnership with the exchange, he explained:  “Gram Vault's trading desk will use Blackmoon alongside other liquidity providers to trade Grams for its users. Blackmoon committed to allocate necessary resources for the technical integration with TON and the Gram listing.”  Vasin hesitated to predict the price of the token once it’s listed at Blackmoon, guessing $3. During the two rounds of Telegram’s token sale, investors paid $0.37 and $1.33 per token. Later, on the unauthorized secondary market, the tokens fetched as much as $4 apiece.  TON is expected to launch no later than Oct. 31. On Sept. 6, the code for TON blockchain nodes was rolled out, marking the final stage of testing before the launch.  UPDATE (September 10, 16:35 UTC): This article has been updated to include comments received after publication from Oleg Seydak, and to correct the location of Blackmoon Crypto; it is registered in Malta, while its token-issuing affiliate is in the Cayman Islands.

42430957,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMymjh,1568073637,IBM Employees Now Hold 6 of 11 Seats on Hyperledger Steering Committee,"IBM has doubled the number of its employees on the technical steering committee (TSC) of Hyperledger, stoking concerns about the tech giant's influence on the enterprise blockchain consortium.  Six out of the 11 2019-2020 TSC members announced last week are IBM employees. Five work at Big Blue itself and one, Mark Wagner, is a senior principal engineer at Red Hat, an IBM subsidiary. By comparison, the previous year's TSC had only two IBM representatives and the same number of total seats (Wagner served on the committee, but IBM's acquisition of Red Hat did not close until July 2019).  The new committee will begin governing after the new TSC chair is elected next week.  While IBM has long played a major role in Hyperledger, having contributed the code for Fabric, the consortium's biggest and oldest project, the election results rattled some participants from rival firms.  Todd Little, a blockchain platform architect at Oracle, wrote in the TSC mailing list:  “It is very clear that IBM now controls the TSC and is that the direction Hyperledger wants to take?”  At stake is the direction of one of the three most widely adopted enterprise blockchain platforms, the others being R3's Corda and variants of the ethereum blockchain. The Hyperledger TSC is responsible for creating working groups to focus on technical issues, approving projects and reviewing updates.  Low voter turnout was also raised as a reason to mistrust IBM’s dominance on the committee, with only 33 percent of Hyperledger members casting ballots.  “It has been shown that in a low turnout election, committed and well-organized groups dominate,” wrote Vipin Bharathan, an enterprise blockchain consultant.  IBM had no comment by press time.  True Blue?  Brian Behlendorf, Hyperledger's executive director, responded to the concerns on the mailing list discussion.  Hyperledger developers “are expected to participate and contribute as individuals first, and as employees second,” Behlendorf wrote.  He added that Hyperledger staff had privately given feedback in the past when seeing TSC members act out of loyalty to their employers, that the community can call out misbehavior, and that Hyperledger can’t change the outcome of an election just because the results aren’t what members expected.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Behlendorf noted that the voter turnout was consistent with what Hyperledger had experienced in the past. ""It's not like Linux or other open source organizations have 100 percent or 80 percent turnout,"" he said.  Around 130 of the 600 eligible voters participated in this last election. Anyone who contributes code to Hyperledger is allowed to vote, and anyone can nominate themselves or someone else.  Since the company has made more technical contributions than any other company associated with the consortium, this is not the first time that IBM has been suspected of having outsized control at Hyperledger, which has not been the company’s intention, Behlendorf told the mailing list.  “[I]t was made clear to us that IBM didn’t want that outcome,” he wrote. “They brought Fabric to Hyperledger to get developer leverage, so that their headcount would be complemented by the efforts of many others.”  Hyperledger worked with IBM on the technical process and public perception issues.  “I believe these are in the past,” Blehendorf wrote. “They no longer are more than half the contributions into Fabric ... There are many other projects beyond Fabric in Hyperledger, and IBM has supported those, boosting Indy and Sawtooth and now even welcoming Besu. Perhaps this is one reason the other electors felt comfortable voting for the IBM-employed candidates.”  The way forward  Blenhendorf then suggested that the TSC discuss increasing the size of the committee with the governing board or for “one time add of a set of new TSC members, so that this greater representation can happen in the current TSC team.”  Little argued that the TSC requirements seemed to be lacking. Under the voting process, he said, one outcome could be a steering committee run by non-Hyperledger members.  “[I]t just seems a little odd to me that there aren’t any diversity requirements for the TSC,” Little wrote. Replying to Behlendorf, he added: “You are correct in that the TSC members are individuals and not companies, but everyone [sic] of them know who butters their bread.”  Bob Summerwill, executive director of the Ethereum Classic Cooperative, noted another kind of diversity win, however.  Two women, Tracy Kuhrt, a technology architect at Accenture’s emerging technology division, and Swetha Repakula, a software engineer at IBM’s Open Technologies, won committee seats.  Summerwill told the mailing list:  ""While I would agree that the high level of IBM affiliation on the 2019-2020 committee is less than ideal, I must take the opportunity to congratulate Tracy and Swetha both on standing for AND winning election to the TSC following years of 100% male candidates.""
