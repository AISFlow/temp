42424903,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWuVh,1368569715,Liberty City Ventures launches $15 Million fund to invest in Bitcoin startups,"As interest in Bitcoin grows, so too does the number of investments related to the digital currency. Case in point: Liberty City Ventures today announced the creation of a $15 million Digital Currency Fund to support bitcoin and other digital currency startups.  The goal of the Digital Currency Fund is to start providing the resources necessary to fuel the digital currency ecosystem, says Liberty City Ventures partner Dorothy Jean.  “In order for Bitcoin to become mainstream, we're going to need a variety of world-class services/products that include exchanges, banks, brokerages, payment systems and other parts of a typical financial system,” Jean said in an e-mail to CoinDesk.  “We are committed to fueling the growth of this ecosystem by backing serious Bitcoin startups,"" Jean added. ""The complex nature of payment systems and regulation around them is inherently capital-intensive, and that’s why we thought now would be the time to dedicate a fund to this sector.”  Jean says Liberty City’s partners have been investing in financial services and payment companies for more than 15 years: “We’ve been interested in currencies for a long time and we see digital currencies as being a step function more evolved.”  She continued, “In 2010, we took notice of Bitcoin as an interesting alternative that addresses many of the issues with fiat-based currencies. Initially we were active miners and investors. Over the last few years and especially in the last few months, we really started to see how bitcoin has the potential to become the de facto currency of the internet and in real life.”  Liberty City’s new fund isn’t the first of its kind. SecondMarket founder and CEO Barry Silbert recently launched the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund.  Liberty City says it’s also working on building a supportive community around bitcoin startups: “We are putting together a bitcoin incubator in NYC as a community for a few early-stage Bitcoin-focused companies.”  The company hosts and sponsors the monthly NY Bitcoin Startups Meetup.  Silicon Valley accelerator Boost VC is also taking an interest in new ventures around digital currencies, dedicating $350,000 to funding bitcoin-focused startups.  Boost provides a 12-week program for startup companies that includes housing, office space, mentoring and a cash investment.  Boost’s goal is to help make bitcoin simple for non-technical users, according to founder Adam Draper.  “We are especially interested in startups that make it easier to actually spend bitcoin currency,” Draper told Wired.com. “Security is another big opportunity. If bitcoin is to succeed as a global currency and really start being used for transactions, everyone needs to trust it.”  Boost VC has already accepted two bitcoin startups into its latest class, Wired reports, with money set aside for at least five more. The application deadline is June 1, and the next program starts on June 24.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Doug Watt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/14/liberty-city-ventures-launches-15-million-fund-to-invest-in-bitcoin-startups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/85c18e78ab681e6179ed7297e6e02c579d65e80c-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424886,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWu3h,1368556717,Google Ventures invests in Bitcoin competitor OpenCoin,"Google Ventures and China-based IDG Capital Partners are the second group of tech investors in two months to place a bet on OpenCoin, the company behind the currently-in-beta Ripple open-source payments protocol.  OpenCoin announced today that it had closed an additional round of funding  -- the amount wasn't specified -- with Google Ventures and IDG Capital Partners. (Hat tip to GigaOM for the news.)  Last month, OpenCoin wrapped up an earlier angel round of funding from another high-profile group of technology VCs: Andreessen Horowitz, FF Angel IV, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Vast Ventures and the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund.  Co-founded by Jed McCaleb, a veteran of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange, and Chris Larsen, who previously established E-LOAN, OpenCoin is developing ripple, an open-source payments platform being touted as a quick, easy and low-cost way to exchange currency of any kind anywhere in the world. Ripples are also the name for the digital form of money (abbreviation: XRP) that will be among the currencies tradable on the ripple platform.  (Note: OpenCoin is not the same as OpenCoin.org, a different organization developing an open-source electronic cash system.)  Although ripples are a digital currency like bitcoin, OpenCoin says its coin will complement bitcoin rather than compete with it. In its "" Introduction to Ripple for Bitcoinershttps://ripple.com/wiki/Introduction_to_Ripple_for_Bitcoiners,"" the company states:  ""Ripple will likely be the easiest way to buy and sell bitcoins. Ripple's built-in exchange will allow people to buy and sell bitcoins using any other currency on the ripple network.""  Like bitcoins, ripples will also be limited in number. OpenCoin plans to ultimately create 100 billion, releasing half into circulation and keeping half to help ensure the currency's stability.  Google Ventures  describes itself as ""a radically different kind of venture-capital fund."" Founded in 2009, it has invested in more than 100 companies so far and plans to invest over $1 billion over the next five years.  IDG Capital Partners  is a ""China-focused investment firm with over $2.5 billion (US) capital under management.""",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/14/google-ventures-invests-in-bitcoin-competitor-opencoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49d38589dc68947e424aeb174f0fcdfb0180e0b7-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424866,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWrZh,1368543690,Is Bitcoin inherently criminal? We asked a criminal...,"(Following is part two of CoinDesk’s look at Bitcoin’s reputation as a currency for hackers and buyers of illegal drugs. See part one here.)  Face it: Many people who complain that bitcoin is just for criminals are thinking specifically of Silk Road, the “deep web” marketplace that uses Tor anonymizing tools to allow online purchases with bitcoins. The site sells various products, but most of them are pharmaceutical or recreational drugs.  Talking to people who use bitcoin on Silk Road, though, reveals the site is likely not creating criminals. There’s a fair amount of hassle and fiddling required to use Silk Road properly. Anecdotes and forum posts suggest that existing users who choose to buy certain, ahem, substances online were already previously buying them in the real world … much like music buyers who now use iTunes and Amazon once used Napster. In fact, many Silk Road users were previously buying drugs online through other, less secure, sites and payment methods.  CoinDesk spoke to a bitcoin and Silk Road user who requested anonymity. Asked if the currency encouraged criminality he said, “I’ve heard of a taxi driver in Hereford who takes them, and I saw something about whisky … as long as it’s not Bowmore, I might buy that.”  Anyway, he continued, engaging in the bitcoin economy isn’t for those seeking instant gratification.  “First of all buying bitcoins can take days … the first time I bought them I actually benefited from the delay by exchange rates going up about 20 percent, but it could have been the opposite.  “Everyone talks about lack of fees to buy bitcoins, but don’t forget bank charges. You need to transfer money to a foreign bank – I couldn’t find any UK-based exchanges and there aren’t that many in Europe. My bank charged me £15 to transfer £150 to Poland to buy two coins. But the next time I wanted to buy coins the exchange – Bit24 – had been closed by the Polish authorities. I had to find another exchange I trusted. There’s loads out there, but most look well dodgy.  “The biggest exchange is Mt. Gox, but it is based in Japan and transactions take five days. I wanted something for the weekend so that was too long to wait. In the end, I found two coins for sale on eBay for about £160 – at the time they were trading for about £70 (each) so I paid a bit over the odds to get them fast.”  Our source buys bitcoins and spends them almost immediately, so he isn’t unduly worried about exchange rate changes … although he points out that the long wait is a worry. He doesn’t see it as encouraging criminality:  “I use them to buy hash. It saves me buying off some kid in a tracksuit and so far has been better quality than I’d get on the street. As a currency, bitcoin does no more to encourage criminality than a £20 note does.”  Jeremy Cook, chief economist at online currency exchange World First, said: “I don’t think in 30 to 40 years we will see a solely online currency not backed by a central bank. As for criminality it would be disingenuous to say it was founded to help criminals, although people are taking advantage of its anonymity to use it for nefarious purposes.”  Cook continued, “The idea of people in Spain or Cyprus taking euros and changing them into bitcoins is crazy. In the short-term the price may continue to go up – because the cost of processing to earn bitcoins is getting more expensive. But we won’t really know until all the coins are mined – when all 21 million are out there, we will be able to see how useful it is.”  Cook added that World First had had no enquiries from customers wanting to trade bitcoin or any other alternative currencies.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2013/05/14/is-bitcoin-inherently-criminal-we-asked-a-criminal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c610a93342931a62c50265e6cfd94862891a330-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424857,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWrPh,1368529217,TerraHash starts Avalon OEM gold rush,"Another ASIC mining firm has entered the fray, this time using chips from a third party provider. Californian firm TerraHash is promising customers huge mining rigs using Avalon ASIC chips from designer BitSuncom.      The company will use ASIC boards from BKKCoin, a Thailand-based electrical engineer who has been creating a specification for a circuit board containing 16 Avalon chips.      “The boards for which we provide the Avalon ASICs, will start shipping in about 2 months,” said Terrahash in its FAQ. “We have already ordered 20,000 Avalon chips, and will order more in the coming days. As soon as we start receiving those chips, we will start shipping out our orders.”      Unlike Butterfly Labs, which has provided little more than a handful of review units to the press, Avalon has already shipped its mining hardware en masse. It has now started taking orders for just the ASICs themselves in batches of at least 10,000. The race is now on to assemble them onto circuit boards that are capable of mining.    BKKcoin is doing just that. Its design is codenamed Klondike, and was not yet complete as of Tuesday, but the developer promises that he is close to completion. In the meantime, Bitsuncom has released the reference designhttps://github.com/BitSyncom/avalon-ref for a ten-ASIC board as an open source specification, enabling anyone to take it and run with it. This effectively scales its business model by allowing other manufacturers to use its chips as the engine for their own products, and means that Terrahash is unlikely to be the only company offering bitcoin mining rigs on Avalon-based boards. As these systems begin rolling out, it is also likely to dramatically increase the difficulty of mining bitcoins. This is a race to the finish.    Terrahash is trying to establish its credibility up front. The company, which failed to return requests for comment, is not taking money for pre-orders (unlike competitor Butterfly Labs, which is working on its own ASIC design).      The company will offer the Klondike boards, prepopulated with ASIC chips, with hash rates of 4.5Ghash/sec or 18Ghas/sec. It will also assemble those boards for customers who wish to send in their own chips.      It will also offer the TerraHash DX Mini, a box featuring up to 20 4.5Ghash/sec boards, for a total capacity of 100Ghash/sec. The TerraHash DX Large will feature up to 10 18Ghash/sec boards for a total of 180Ghash/sec.      The 4.5Ghash/sec boards consume 32 watts of power, while the 18Ghash/sec units run at 128 watts.      The company is preparing a turnkey service for would-be miners. It will host the boards for them, and offer them a bitcoin payout proportional to their hash input, effectively operating its own mining pool.      At current difficulty levels, a fully-populated DX Mini should pay for itself in 13 days, according to calculations made at BitcoinX.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2013/05/14/terrahash-starts-avalon-oem-gold-rush,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424855,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWrLh,1368527000,Steambits takes bitcoins for games,"Bitcoins are now being accepted for videogames, courtesy of a service called Steambits.      The web site was launched last month by developer Ryan Connors, a lover of videogames, who wanted to offer a way to purchase them using the cryptocurrency. The web site is effectively a video game resale service. The customer pays for a game in bitcoins, and Connors then purchases it from the relevant party in US dollars, sending it to the customer within 24 hours.      The site started by offering games from Steam, the online videogaming portal, which sells games to users via online download. However, it has since expanded to include other, non-Steam games too, including codes for downloading games for the XBox 360.      The site hit a speed bump on May 5, when Steam noticed what was happening. “We had some (semi-anticipated) issues with Steam once we hit a certain volume of sales,” Connors posted in a support thread on Bitcointalk. The site was down for a time, but then continued with a limited selection, but has now expanded again.      The site is a good example of how goods not normally purchasable with bitcoin can be manually purchased as a service. The service provider can then make money from movements in bitcoin pricing.      Connors has also been offering several games at prices below Steam’s US dollar pricing. His methods are unclear, although gamers have been known to purchase games from different geographies, taking advantage of differences in regional pricing.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/14/steambits-takes-bitcoins-for-games,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ffe077bcb1dd577233d3608ab37364bde2312c3-614x369.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424856,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWrJh,1368520231,"Spies, cops and taxmen gather to talk Bitcoin","Police officers, spies and tax collectors from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs met in London yesterday to discuss approaches to alternative currencies.  ""The Future of Money"" conference considered the implications for tax, crime fighting and espionage if Bitcoin, or a similar system, wins widespread adoption.  The meeting was attended by staff from HMRC, Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), the Home Office and GCHQ.  A spin doctor for the Revenue told the FT one idea was to establish a regulated exchange which forced customers to reveal their identities. Several exchanges worldwide have been forced to close after losing banking services.  Banks in several countries, including Canada and Poland, have already effectively shut down exchanges by withdrawing banking services.  A regulated and recoginsed exchange would be a major boost to the credibility of the currency - even if it scares off the tinfoil hat brigade.  The Revenue told the pink paper that it was monitoring the development of the alternative currency market.  The spokesman for the Revenue told Coindesk:  “HMRC officials regularly attend conferences and external events, both to communicate the work of the department and to further understand the current tax-related issues.  “The tax system already deals with transactions in currencies other than sterling. Any such transaction will be potentially taxable”.  The conference was organised by the Foresight Horizon Scanning Centre - an offshoot of the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills.
