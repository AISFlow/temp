On Monday, sales volumes of CryptoPunks topped $86 million, a daily record, according to data from the industry tracking website CryptoSlamhttps://cryptoslam.io/cryptopunks.    And sales so far in August have already reached $332 million. Prior to August, the largest single monthly sales total was $135.2 million during July. This month's average price for a CryptoPunk is $199,069, more than double last month's average.      The market is so hot that Visa apparently had to pay up for its CryptoPunk purchase, announced Monday. According to CryptoPunks creator Larva Labs, the NFT that Visa bought – CryptoPunk #7610 – was acquired for a price of 49.50 ether, which is about $150,000. That's more than double the price of 21.75 ETH paid less than a month ago by a user named ""gmoney.""      ""We think NFTs will play an important role in the future of retail, social media, entertainment and commerce,"" said Visa’s Head of Crypto Cuy Sheffield in a blog post on Monday.      It's unclear if the surge in CryptoPunk sales was directly the result of Visa's vote of confidence, but more than 300 transactions took place Monday alone, versus a daily range of 16 to 184 over the past month, according to data from CryptoSlam.      Visa’s move, ""largely a PR exercise more than anything else, not only demonstrates how the underlying infrastructure of digital assets has improved over the years but also how quickly these assets can go mainstream,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital.      The ability to facilitate transactions and custody assets using Anchorage (a crypto exchange platform used by institutional investors) shows the willingness of traditional finance giants to adapt, he said.      “It will also likely further serve to boost the value of NFT marketplaces going forward as a whole,” said Vinokourov.

42424695,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVoph,1629750650,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stalls Near $50K Ahead of Options Expiration Date,"Bitcoin stalled after approaching the $50,000 resistance level on Monday. The cryptocurrency was trading at about $49,500 at press time and is up about 8% over the past week. Analysts expect a period of consolidation ahead of Friday’s option expiration date and news from the Federal Reserve’s annual economic policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo.      “The trend is bullish; however, caution is to be exercised at these levels due to the decline in volume as well as resistance from April and May,” Marcus Sotiriou, a trader at GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      “$51K would be a natural place for a short-term pause in the rally,” Katie Stockton, managing director of Fairlead Strategies, wrote in a Monday newsletter.      “Long-term momentum behind bitcoin has strengthened and the 200-day (40-week) moving average is rising again, supporting a bullish long-term outlook,” she wrote.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $49218, +1.14%  Ether (ETH) $3303, +4.25%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4479.5, +0.85%  Gold: $1803, +0.57%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.251%, compared with 1.261% on Friday    Several analysts noted that extreme overbought conditions have unwound since April, which is providing support for the crypto rally.      “Right now, bitcoin and other cryptos have enjoyed technical support (as they were becoming mildly oversold),” Santiago Espinosa, a strategist at MRB Partners, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “At this juncture, some cryptos can continue to do well if policymakers neglect inflationary pressures and regulatory issues don’t become a mainstream problem.”    Bitcoin options expiry    Roughly 25% of bitcoin options open interest is set to expire on Friday. The largest concentration of open interest is seen at the $50,000 strike price, which is also a key technical resistance level.      “Despite implied volatility softening over the past few weeks, $50K is a large psychological barrier and the open interest concentration could prove choppy going into expiration,” Gregoire Magadini, co-founder and CEO of Genesis Volatility, wrote in a Telegram chat.      The bitcoin options market is placing a 45% chance of BTC trading above $50,000 by the end of September, according to options data provider, Skew.    Bloomberg's McGlone still bullish on bitcoin    Bloomberg Intelligence's Mike McGlone, who won plaudits last year for being among the most prominent analysts predicting that bitcoin would go to $50,000, sees further upside now that the largest cryptocurrency has returned to the mark following a steep market correction.      ""Bitcoin, gold and long bonds are top assets set to outperform"" in the second half of 2021, McGlone wrote Monday in a report. ""The firstborn crypto may have solved the age-old problem of a global reserve asset that's easily transportable and transactionable, has 24/7 price discovery, is relatively scarce and is nobody's liability or project.""    BTC holdings rise    The percentage of bitcoin profitable addresses (BTC value above the cost basis) reached a three-month high, according to Glassnode data.      “The decline in realized losses of late could indicate that investors have found renewed conviction to hold on, or are potentially taking exits that are closer to their original cost basis, as price recovers towards the $50K range,” Glassnode wrote in a Monday blog post.    Crypto fund inflows    Crypto funds saw $21 million of net inflows last week as digital-asset markets rallied, pushing the total assets under management (AUM) to $57.3 billion, the highest level since May, a new report shows.      The latest data reflected a reversal after six consecutive weeks of outflows, according to the report Monday by digital-asset manager CoinShares.      Funds focused on Solana’s SOL token saw the largest inflow among all digital assets, at $7.1 million last week, the report shows. The token hit an all-time high of $82 on Saturday, according to Messari.      Investors redeemed $2.8 million from bitcoin-focused funds last week, the seventh consecutive week of outflows, despite the largest cryptocurrency’s price upturn. The run matched the streak of outflows recorded in early 2018, the report noted. That was just before the “crypto winter,” when cryptocurrency prices tanked and failed to return to all-time highs for more than two years.    Altcoin roundup  Visa buys a CryptoPunk for $150K: Visa has bought CryptoPunk 7610, a female CryptoPunk character for around $150,000, taking a step into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as it seeks to learn more about the burgeoning market. A collection of nine rare CryptoPunks that were among the first 1,000 minted fetched almost $17 million in an auction at Christie's in May. Cuy Sheffield, Visa's head of crypto, said in a blog post that the main purpose behind Visa's purchase was to learn more about the growing market. ""We think NFTs will play an important role in the future of retail, social media, entertainment and commerce,"" Sheffield wrote. ""To help our clients and partners participate, we need a firsthand understanding of the infrastructure requirements for a global brand to purchase, store and leverage an NFT.""  Tether starts printing again: Tether, issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, has started printing again after a roughly two-month halt that sparked investors’ concerns and speculation. Tether has minted at least 2.3 billion USDT since Aug. 1, pushing the token’s market cap to $65 billion, a Tether representative told CoinDesk via email. Demand for USDT has recently rebounded, according to Tether and industry experts, as crypto market sentiment has turned more positive. It’s possible, however, that the demand for USDT may not be driven by bitcoin but instead by some altcoins, such as solana (SOL) and terra (LUNA), whose trading volumes have surged, according to Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at crypto prime broker Genesis Global Trading, which shares common ownership with CoinDesk.  USDC to change reserves: The world’s second-largest stablecoin, USDC, will be 100% backed by cash and short-term U.S. Treasurys by September, according to developer Centre, a consortium of crypto exchange Coinbase and payments technology company Circle. Circle revealed last month that only 61% of tokens were backed by ""cash and cash equivalents,"" referring to cash and money-market funds. Centre “will ensure that the USDC investments revert back to a more conservative investment profile by the end of September,” Emilie Choi, president and chief operating officer at Coinbase, wrote in a tweet.

42424691,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVodh,1629750364,CFTC Commissioner Stump Decries 'Oversimplification' That Crypto Is Either a Security or Commodity,"The U.S.' top commodities regulator primarily oversees derivatives markets, rather than spot commodity markets, Dawn Stump, a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC), said Monday.      Stump, who was appointed by then-President Donald Trump in 2018, joined a growing group of regulators debating which federal agency should regulate the booming digital asset market in the United States.      In her statement, Stump described a “grossly inaccurate oversimplification” that digital assets are either securities or commodities that fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. If they are deemed to be securities, they would be regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.      Because the CFTC doesn’t regulate commodities themselves – only futures contracts or derivative products like swaps – Stump said it doesn’t matter whether digital assets are classified as securities or commodities, because they wouldn’t fall under the authority of the CFTC unless a futures or derivatives contract was involved.      Earlier this month, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said that his agency should regulate a broader segment of the crypto market, including possibly spot market and exchanges that list any cryptocurrencies that fall under securities law. In response, crypto-friendly CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz tweeted that the SEC has no authority over “pure commodities or their trading venues” – implying that responsibility belongs to the CFTC.      In her statement Monday, Stump also explained the difference between the CFTC’s regulatory authority, which Stump said doesn’t apply to digital assets, and its broader enforcement authority, which Stump suggested does. Using the CFTC’s case against crypto exchange and derivatives trading platform BitMEX as an example, Stump said the agency has historically used its anti-manipulation and anti-fraud enforcement authority to protect cash commodities.      “Because well-functioning futures contracts (and other derivatives products) rely upon a sound underlying cash market and may reference cash market indexes in their pricing. Thus, the CFTC utilizes this particular enforcement authority to protect the integrity of the derivatives markets that it regulates,” Stump wrote.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/08/23/cftc-commissioner-stump-decries-oversimplification-that-crypto-is-either-a-security-or-commodity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/05c15f08184f9f3ce21a7240c758bcb9bce349f6-1600x881.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424694,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVonh,1629747459,"Cuando China habló, bitcoin reaccionó. ¿Cuando lo hizo Estados Unidos? No tanto","Los gobiernos no pueden detener a las criptomonedas, pero sí pueden dificultar el acceso a ellas. Así que tendría sentido que las políticas gubernamentales poco amistosas de las mayores economías del mundo influyeran en la caída del precio de bitcoin.      Por ejemplo, unos días después de que China reiterara sus medidas drásticas contra el segmento cripto, en mayo, bitcoin llegó a caer hasta un 30%. El desplome fue otro recordatorio de que cuando ese país habla, el mercado escucha.      Al parecer, no ocurre lo mismo con Estados Unidos.    Esta columna apareció originalmente en Crypto Long & Short, newsletter (en inglés) semanal de CoinDesk con ideas, noticias y análisis para el inversor profesional. Suscríbase a Crypto Long & Short aquí.    Este mes se aprobó en el Senado estadounidense una controvertida disposición sobre el impuesto a las criptomonedas en el proyecto de ley de infraestructura de $1 billón, a pesar de los arduos intentos de modificarla. Los defensores de las criptomonedas afirmaron que la disposición haría imposible que los mineros, los desarrolladores de software y otros actores relacionados con la industria cripto cumplieran con las regulaciones fiscales de Estados Unidos, amenazando así con llevar gran parte del sector al extranjero. Esto parecería ser una señal bastante negativa.    Read this essay in English.    Pero no fue así, al menos a corto plazo.      En los posteriores días al avance del proyecto de ley, bitcoin se disparó hasta casi un 7%. De hecho, poco después del drama en Washington, todo el mercado de criptomonedas alcanzó una capitalización de mercado de $2 billones, un pico que no se veía desde mayo.      Esta semana la disposición pasará a la Cámara de Representantes, donde el texto puede o no cambiar. Queda por ver si el mercado responderá a lo que ocurra en Washington.      ¿Por qué bitcoin parece reaccionar de forma tan diferente a Estados Unidos que a China? Como ocurre con todo lo relacionado con su precio, es imposible decirlo con seguridad, y hay muchos otros factores que afectan a sus variaciones. Pero he aquí algunas de las teorías más plausibles.    Los movimientos de China parecen definitivos, pero Estados Unidos solo está comenzando    China ha sido durante mucho tiempo pro-blockchain y recelosa de las criptomonedas, y esta no es para nada la primera vez que Pekín ha tomado medidas enérgicas contra la industria. Pero el gobierno de China parece ir en serio esta vez, al menos para cerrar la minería de criptomonedas. Los mineros chinos parecen entender que es poco probable que protestar por esta política cambie algo, por lo que ya están trazando sus destinos fuera del país.      Sin embargo, la aprobación de la ley estadounidense en el Senado es sólo el principio. Ahora los esfuerzos de presión se centrarán en la Cámara de Representantes, donde el proyecto de ley se debatirá esta semana. Y, si el lenguaje no se modifica allí, la industria cripto no se rendirá. Incluso si la legislación se promulga tal y como está redactada, todavía existe la posibilidad de que el Departamento del Tesoro interprete la definición expansiva del término ""intermediario"" de forma favorable.      Lo que ocurrió en China es ""un barrido completo"", dijo Michael Wu, director general de Amber Group, una empresa de trading de criptomonedas con base en Hong Kong. ""Estados Unidos es visto por muchos como una puerta de entrada al diálogo y las discusiones"", agregó.      Bobby Ong, cofundador y director de operaciones del proveedor de datos CoinGecko, se hizo eco de este sentimiento.      ""La clave es que aún no es la ley definitiva, por lo que el mercado todavía no lo está descontando"", dijo. ""La gente cree que al final prevalecerá la cordura y las cosas se redactarán mejor"".    Lo ocurrido en Washington es realmente bueno para las criptomonedas    Hay algunas luces de esperanza en el drama de las disposiciones fiscales sobre las criptomonedas. El primero es que la industria ha alcanzado por fin su momento de mayor difusión, y ha desempeñado un papel en el retraso de un proyecto de ley de $1 billón. Ha obligado a los legisladores estadounidenses a reconocer al menos su existencia y relevancia. También vimos que la comunidad de criptomonedas, famosa por su descentralización y a menudo dividida, está empezando a convertirse en una verdadera fuerza política. Los defensores no se salieron con la suya esta vez, pero definitivamente consiguieron que la gente prestara atención.      ""La victoria moral se ha ganado"", escribió el director de contenidos de CoinDesk, Michael Casey. ""La comunidad cripto, que alguna vez fue marginal, se encuentra legitimada, lo que eventualmente resultará en un entorno político constructivo para la industria"".    Ni China ni Estados Unidos: se trata de la sincronización del mercado    O tal vez esto es sólo bitcoin siendo bitcoin, y estos movimientos de precios tienen poco que ver con la política de China o Estados Unidos.      La represión de China se produjo en un momento en el cual el mercado estaba en plena ebullición, pero para entonces los precios ya habían empezado a bajar. El índice de precios de Bitcoin de CoinDesk (XBX) cotizaba por encima de $42.000 a finales del 17 de mayo, poco después de salir de su máximo histórico de más de $64.000.      ""Tiene más que ver con los participantes del mercado que con las noticias en sí"", dijo Qiao Wang, socio de DeFi Alliance, una aceleradora de startups. Las noticias de ambos países fueron igual de malas, ""pero cuando se produjeron las de China fueron muy espumosas; cuando se produjeron las de EE.UU., la mayoría de las manos débiles habían vendido"".      ""El momento del mercado también es un factor clave"", dice Jason Lau, director de operaciones del exchange de criptomonedas Okcoin. ""Las noticias de China se produjeron cuando los mercados ya estaban sobreextendidos, bajando y buscando más noticias negativas"". En cambio, en el caso del proyecto de ley de infraestructuras de EE.UU., ""con la recuperación del bitcoin, el mercado buscaba activamente noticias positivas; por eso se vio el giro positivo del estilo 'es increíble cómo la industria fue capaz de reunirse y llevar una voz unida'"".    Estados Unidos no es el centro del universo cripto    Esta puede ser mi teoría favorita: la idea básica es que el mercado reconoció que esta supuesta disposición desastrosa sobre las criptomonedas podría hacerse realidad, pero, en última instancia, no importó mucho.      Porque incluso en el peor de los casos —en el que una gran parte de la industria de activos digitales tuviera que abandonar Estados Unidos— el mercado de las criptomonedas seguiría vivo.      Vale la pena repetirlo: todavía no sabemos cómo reaccionará el mercado a lo que ocurra en el Congreso esta semana. Pero todavía hay razones para creer que Estados Unidos no es el centro del universo cripto.      Por supuesto, no hay duda de que Estados Unidos es una fuerza importante en el segmento cripto —especialmente en lo que respecta a inversión institucional—, pero las criptomonedas son cada vez más globales. Asia ha sido durante mucho tiempo un actor fundamental, mientras que es probable que oigamos hablar cada vez más de África y América Latina. Si bien es notoriamente difícil rastrear con precisión el uso de cripto por geografía, el índice de adopción de 2021 de Chainalysis clasificó a Estados Unidos en el octavo puesto, después de Vietnam, India, Pakistán, Ucrania, Kenia, Nigeria y Venezuela.      Se podría argumentar que en los últimos años China puede haber sido más influyente que Estados Unidos. Por eso el mercado mundial se estremeció, aunque brevemente, cuando China prohibió las ofertas iniciales de monedas y cerró los exchanges de la parte continental en 2017, cuando apenas un año antes la mayoría de las operaciones con bitcoins se realizaban en yuanes chinos. El mercado de criptomonedas de China se mantuvo activo después de 2017, pero el cierre de los exchanges hizo mucho más difícil estimar el número de traders.      En lo que respecta a la minería en particular, se consideraba que China ejercía un poder desproporcionado, especialmente en el hashrate, la potencia de cálculo utilizada para la minería. El hashrate de Bitcoin se redujo en más de un 50% en julio en comparación con mayo, mes en el que China tomó medidas contra la minería, según datos de Glassnode. Desde entonces, el hashrate ha comenzado a recuperarse a medida que los mineros instalan equipos en otras partes del mundo.      ""La noticia de la minería en China fue un choque inesperado para la red Bitcoin, con un impacto real inmediato. Esto condujo a una verdadera incertidumbre en torno a cómo el hashrate y la red se verían afectados"", dijo Lau, quien agregó: ""Compara esto con la discusión sobre la política de Estados Unidos, que podría haber llevado a algunos efectos a largo plazo específicos para el país. Demasiado vago y nada relacionado con la salud de la red en sí"".      Ahora, con los mineros extendiéndose por todo el mundo, la influencia de China sobre la red Bitcoin está disminuyendo.      Puede que pronto veamos un día en el que ningún gobierno pueda tener un impacto importante en el precio de bitcoin. Dada la procedencia de Bitcoin como moneda descentralizada e inmune al control gubernamental, así debería ser.

42424693,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVojh,1629745598,Tether Starts Printing Again After 2-Month Pause,"Tether, issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, has started printing again after a roughly two-month halt that sparked investors’ concerns and speculation.      Tether has minted at least 2.3 billion USDT since Aug. 1, pushing the token's market cap to $65 billion, a Tether representative told CoinDesk via email. USDT, which is pegged to U.S. dollars, usually trades at $1.      In June and July, USDT’s market cap stagnated around $62 billion despite small fluctuations. Industry experts attributed the reduced demand to China’s crackdown on crypto, the rise of the competing stablecoin USDC and investor concerns over Tether’s own vulnerability.      Demand for USDT has recently rebounded, according to Tether and industry experts, as crypto market sentiment has turned increasingly positive. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap, bitcoin, has rebounded from its July low of around $29,600, trading at $49,540 as of press time, up 1.8% over the past 24 hours.      “From a supply/demand perspective, as crypto prices go up, more stablecoins and fiat are needed to buy the assets and expand the total market cap of crypto,” Gary Pike, director of sales and trading at crypto services firm B2C2, told CoinDesk.      “We are seeing increased trading activity across venues that support Tether tokens,” a Tether representative said.      It's possible, however, that the increased demand for USDT recently may not be driven by bitcoin but instead by some altcoins, such as solana (SOL) and terra (LUNA), whose trading volumes surged, according to Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at crypto prime broker Genesis Global Trading. Their main trading pair is USDT. (Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)      The average trading volume of USDT against solana for the first 22 days in August stood at 386.6 million, up from a July average of 123.4 million and a June average of 290.7 million, according to CryptoCompare. The average trading volume of USDT against terra for the first 22 days in August was 320.2 million, up from a July average of 120.5 million and a June average of 98 million.      “BTC’s price may be up, but trading volumes haven’t changed much,” noted Acheson.      Others cited Tether’s increased transparency as another reason for the rebounding demand. In its new attestation published on Aug. 9, Tether provided more details than ever before on the composition of its $62.8 billion of reserves, including its long-questioned reserves of commercial paper (CP) and certificates of deposit (CDs).      Roughly 49% of Tether’s $62.8 billion reserves are invested in commercial paper (CP) – typically short-term corporate debt – and certificates of deposit (CDs), out of which roughly 93% was rated A-2 and above, 5.5% at A-3 and 1.5% below A-3 as of June 30.      The latest disclosure “could be the reason for the resumption of printing, alongside renewed investor confidence and demand,"" Sean Rooney, head of research at crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments, wrote to CoinDesk in an email.      But for many, there's still a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) surrounding Tether's reserves.      It will take ""multiple years for all of the critics to be convinced,” Pike said.",POSITIVE,SOL | USDT,BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | USDT,Frances Yue,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/23/tether-starts-printing-again-after-2-month-pause,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e041044e0825484980ea501c404f6074423c281e-2560x1651.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ernesto Sanabria, a spokesman for Bukele, told CoinDesk that “the president has been clear in saying that the use of bitcoin is not mandatory.”      Asked about a possible change to Article 7, Sanabria said he had already addressed the issue in his response. He did not specify whether the article will be eliminated or otherwise modified.      On digital wallets to use bitcoin, Bukele said El Salvador residents “will be able to accept payments in bitcoin or in dollars, open a small business and manage it from there, receive money from family or friends and send and receive remittances without paying a single cent of commission to anyone.”      “If they want to. If they don't, just don't download anything and that's it,” he wrote.      If bitcoin is received, it can be converted into U.S. dollars, left in a digital wallet or converted into cash at one of the 200 ATMs that will be available in the country, Bukele said, adding that “there will also be 50 branches to withdraw or deposit money.”      On the use of bitcoin for remittances, Bukele wrote that Salvadorans abroad will be able to send money instantly to family members living in the country. “You can send bitcoin (if you want) or you can send dollars, if you want.”      “If you don't want to, you can always go to Western Union and pay a commission. No problem at all,” Bukele said.      Zelaya said last Tuesday that the use of bitcoin and digital wallets in El Salvador will be “totally optional,” and businesses that do not accept the cryptocurrency will not be penalized.

Circle&apos;s USD Coin was a dollar-backed stablecoin. Last month Circle announced that the dollar no longer backed its currency because cash was only 60 percent of the currency&apos;s capitals. The other 40 percent is backed by different bonds and debt securities. How a stablecoin is constituted is very important and what differentiates it from other crypto is that they are linked to a currency such as the Euro and the Dollar. This is because people want to evade volatility with cryptocurrencies like BTC, Ether, and other cryptos. Circle changes the makeup of USD Coin Circle announces that changes the makeup of USD Coins for a second time. This change will be for cash and rewards from the U.S. Treasury bonds. Coinbase and Centre, the company created by Circle announced the changes late Sunday. The Circle consortium said that they know the views on USD Coin exchanges within the public. The company indicates that the goal is to improve security and trust while the regulatory scheme evolves.

42424676,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVoFh,1629739242,Why Did Visa Buy a $150K NFT? Why Does Anyone?,"If you’re anything like me, you’ve been wishing for a quiet week in crypto news for a while now. Wouldn’t it be nice to sleep? But no, Visa decided to announce Monday morning that it paid $150,000 for a CryptoPunk NFT, a kind of blockchain art token, to add to its “collection of historic commerce artifacts.” In an accompanying blog post, Visa declared that “NFTs mark a new chapter for digital commerce.”      There are certain events and inflection points that mark the transition from fringe to something approaching mainstream, and crypto and blockchain have already had at least two of those in recent months. First we had a nation-state getting serious about bitcoin, then the entire U.S. Senate fought over whether wallet programmers are brokers.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Visa’s purchase of a CryptoPunk, I think, serves as a similar marker for the inevitable mainstreaming of non-fungible tokens. They’ve already featured on ""Saturday Night Live"" and drawn in celebrities from Tom Brady to Jay-Z, but the apparent stamp of approval from a major financial institution takes things to another level. Cynically, $150,000 is probably a steal for Visa considering the PR it’ll get (including this article). But the announcement set off a $20 million frenzy of CryptoPunk trading, and that hype train isn’t coming back to the station.      Visa’s move, though, also returns us to an inescapable question: Why in the name of all that is holy would anyone pay $150,000 for a 25x25 pixel image stored on an extremely expensive and slow database?      It’s impossible to wrap your head around this, I think, if you’re looking for a truly rational or utilitarian explanation. But there are some very good reasons, it turns out, rooted in our deep, totally irrational animal brains – the same strange forces that lead us to make other major purchases that seem completely loony if you think about them too long.      “You have this rock stuck on your finger,” points out William Quigley, co-founder of the NFT-focused WAX blockchain. “It doesn’t look like it does anything. It’ll never do anything. And you paid $10,000 or $20,000 for that.”      The transition to more and more online living, Quigley thinks, means physical status symbols like jewelry have new competition from similarly exclusive digital objects. Both Jay-Z and National Football League player Odell Beckham Jr. have recently bought CryptoPunks costing tens of thousands of dollars (at least) and made them their Twitter avatars. That's probably the biggest single use of NFTs right now. The uselessness, you might say, is the point.    Read more: Visa Takes First Step Into NFTs With CryptoPunk Purchase for Almost $150K    To understand any of this, some basic knowledge about the technology is essential. NFT stands for non-fungible token, which basically means it’s unique. An NFT exists on a blockchain ledger just like a bitcoin or ETH token, but one bitcoin is basically the same as the other several million – they’re “fungible” (with an asterisk).      An NFT is just as immutable as a bitcoin, but there’s only one: There are 10,000 CryptoPunks, but each of them is unique, and that uniqueness creates a lot of variation in their value. Visa, for instance, bought one of about 3,800 female Punks. CryptoPunks are particularly attractive because they were issued in 2017, making them among the first NFTs ever created.      NFTs come in a lot of different forms – they can even be interactive objects programmed to change based on certain inputs – but the most common type right now are image NFTs. Many of these are still essentially links to JPEGs stored elsewhere, which is a genuine problem for trust in the assets. But just last week CryptoPunks announced it had moved all data onto the Ethereum blockchain itself. It seems likely that this move helped push Visa to finalize its decision, because the move makes the assets more robust. Expect more NFTs, especially 8-bit series like the Punks, to transition to on-chain storage rapidly and, if you’re an investor, maybe look for that as a feature.      All this adds up to something deliriously simple: An NFT is a unique digital object. It is exclusive in a way that even bitcoin can’t claim. In fact, not even most real-world status symbols have the capacity to be as unique.      When someone buys an NFT avatar, “they’re saying, this is who I am,” says Henry Love, a managing partner at the NFT-focused investing fund Fundamental Labs. “So it’s more like a custom Rolex with your name on it. It’s one of one.”      Another crucial thing to know is that despite Visa grabbing headlines and all the comparisons to Rolexes and diamond rings, the NFT craze seems to be truly broad and grassroots. Trading volumes on OpenSea, the dominant NFT trading platform, have exploded, recently hitting $1 billion in monthly trading volume for August. But even that’s just the 10,000-foot view: There’s a frenzy of collecting and creation going on across Twitter and Telegram. NFT drop schedules are being watched as closely as Yeezy or Supreme drops were a few years ago.    Read more: Visa Adds Crypto Payments Startup Wyre to Its Fast Track Payments Program    And while a lot of that is fueled by insider speculation, there’s also something that feels much more real and special about this than, say, debating whether you’re going to buy $100 worth of cardano or solana. Because they’re ultimately about identity and taste rather than just money, NFT shopping has a personal element that seems likely to draw a much broader user base.      However, there’s a major barrier, especially for Ethereum-based NFTs like CryptoPunks: Transaction fees on Ethereum make buying and selling less-expensive assets impractical. I was just about to buy a $60 avatar NFT (because I too am an ape afraid of being left behind by my tribe). But the transaction fee was $50, which is quite a psychological barrier.      That’s why low-fee standalone chains like WAX and Flow (which hosts NBA Top Shot), which are largely focused on less-pricey branded collectibles, are significant right now, and have a real opportunity to grow from a core value proposition. It also suggests the market for NFTs on Ethereum, which have a significant credibility premium, will get substantially more insane, particularly at the low end, when Ethereum completes its transition to a lower-fee, proof-of-stake system.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,David Z.

42424686,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVoXh,1629738962,Another US Bank Joins the Small List Willing to Serve Crypto Companies,"Customers Bank, based in West Reading, Pennsylvania, is joining the small list of FDIC-insured institutions in the U.S. that are willing to work with cryptocurrency businesses.      The bank will compete against Silvergate in California and Signature in New York in offering crypto firms basic accounts as well as a blockchain-based platform for clients to instantly send each other dollars 24/7.      “We are well-positioned to be a great third banking option that can offer a strong offering to the digital asset space,” said Cameron Somers, Customers Bank's head of digital assets. ""The main focus is to build a low cost deposit franchise very similar to what Signature Bank and what Silvergate Bank has done.”      Because of onerous anti-money-laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, most U.S. banks have been reluctant to work with cryptocurrency firms. The exchanges and other firms that serve the digital asset market, however, process high volumes of payments and typically seek multiple banks to store and move their users’ fiat.      “Customers continue to try to find ways to be involved, engaged, and interested in the cryptocurrency world,” said Sam Sidhu, Customers Bank’s vice chair and chief operating officer. “Some banks might offer rewards or custody services to consumers. We are focused on the businesses that may directly or indirectly service those customers.”    Tokenized dollars    Ten to 15 clients will begin testing Customers’ blockchain payments platform from a technology provider called Tassat in September before the bank opens the service up to the rest of the crypto ecosystem in October.      ""Once we have a fully functional ecosystem with a number of different types of institutions on that platform then the idea would be to continue to expand from there and then potentially build on some additional products and features within our offering,” Somers said.      The Tassat Pay Network provides real-time blockchain payments by tokenizing U.S. dollar deposits and moving them between digital wallets on Tassat’s platform. Conceptually, it is similar to JPMorgan Chase’s JPM coin, which enables the megabank’s corporate customers to send each other money instantaneously using a private blockchain.      Similarly, Tassat’s blockchain can only facilitate payments between clients of the banks using it, though the platform is connected to traditional payments systems like the automated clearing house (ACH) and Fedwire.      The on-chain fiat payments will be free, in contrast to the fees for sending payments via ACH, and Customers Bank said it expects to pay little or no interest on these firms’ deposits. “So they’ll be the raw material for our bank to provide loans,” Sidhu said.      Customers Bank also plans to offer Tassat Pay to non-crypto clients in accounting, alternative energy, commercial real estate, healthcare, hospitality, insurance and manufacturing, Sidhu said.    Main Street banking    With $19.6 billion in assets, Customers Bank is 0.52% the size of JPMorgan, and regional institutions like this are the sweet spot for Tassat.      The partnership is a first for Tassat outside powering Signature Bank’s Signet. The fintech provider is courting banks with deposits between $5 billion to $200 billion, said Tassat CEO Ron Totaro. (Similarly, digital asset management firm NYDIG is targeting payments and banking tech providers to help smaller banks compete in the crypto space).      “The nation’s largest banks are experimenting with blockchain to launch new services and attract deposits and customers, often away from small and midsize institutions,” Totaro said. “What they have—that small and midsize institutions don’t—is an expansive budget, teams and ability to experiment. In contrast, small and midsize banks need to see ROI from every cent they spend on technology.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/23/another-us-bank-joins-the-small-list-willing-to-serve-crypto-companies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f2432a123f28d882acb8ee215d2526998e493a8-594x396.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421257,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXklZ7,1629727200,"Introducing Crypto for Advisors, a Newsletter for Financial Planners","CoinDesk is launching a new newsletter – one that’s different from our existing titles in an important way. It’s called Crypto for Advisors, and we’re building it specifically for financial advisors (FAs) and registered investment advisors (RIAs). The newsletter will do what CoinDesk is best at – informing and educating a highly engaged audience – only this time the audience is financial professionals who are new to crypto, curious about it and looking for ways to incorporate it into their work.  Why a newsletter for this audience, and why now? Read on.  Financial security is inherently a long game. We all want it, but few of us are sophisticated enough about markets and assets to take that security into our own hands. That’s why the financial advisor industry exists.  Similarly, the world of crypto is a mystery to many. That’s not surprising: The intricacies of cryptocurrencies and the markets built around them can be profoundly different from traditional assets. That learning curve keeps many people out of the market.  Still, the rapid expansion of crypto as an asset class has fueled a lot of curiosity. A recent survey by Gemini revealed 63% of U.S. adults consider themselves “crypto curious,” meaning they want to learn more or are planning to buy crypto soon.  In a normal world, those people would turn to financial advisors to help them navigate the subject. But while some FAs and RIAs have stepped up and studied crypto markets to figure out their place in the portfolios of people looking for long-term success, many others have taken a more absolute approach to the crypto industry and avoid it altogether. While that’s certainly the safest approach, it also cuts them – and their clients – out of this interesting and growing asset class.  Such a conservative approach is often the result of a lack of knowledge and resources – and that’s where our new newsletter comes in. Every week, Crypto for Advisors will speak directly to the FA community, informing and educating FAs about how crypto can fit into their lives as well as unpacking the most recent developments in crypto and finance for investors curious about this asset class.  Why us? For starters, CoinDesk is home to the best reporting about crypto and crypto markets on the planet, and has been for the better part of a decade. From that foundation, we’ve tapped into our community, in particular the people who helped us create Bitcoin for Advisors to help create this newsletter. You’ll see authors from the advisor world, journalists who cover the industry and writers who specialize in explaining the complex landscape of crypto to financially sophisticated audiences.  The rapidly expanding crypto market is attracting the attention of the world, and many investors are anxious to turn their curiosity into action. To help them find their way in this new – and volatile – territory, they need financial advisors who can continually build their understanding of digital assets. And Crypto for Advisors is designed to do just that.

In a P2P lending scenario, lenders are typically referred to as &apos;investors,&apos; who loan money to qualified applicants. The intermediary website (P2P platform) usually sets the rates and the term for the lending agreement, and once the terms are agreed by both parties, the transaction will be facilitated. To better understand P2P lending, it&apos;s important to have a firm grasp of the traditional banking model. Typically, if you want to take out a loan, you must fill out a loan application and submit it to the bank. The bank will then assess your creditworthiness and any other factors they deem relevant before deciding on whether or not they will grant you the loan and the terms you will be offered. Once terms have been agreed, the bank will then source the capital from either the central bank or from the savings deposits of their other banking customers. There are a few challenges involved with this method: Banks generally operate with a strict risk management strategy, which automatically disqualifies those with poor credit or a lack of credit history. Banks usually offer poor rates and often apply fees to the total loan value, which increases the price of repayments.

42424688,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVohh,1629718439,Bitcoin on Longest Weekly Winning Run in 9 Months Ahead of Jackson Hole Symposium,"Bitcoin has chalked up an impressive rally ahead of the Federal Reserve's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Friday. Analysts say the virtual event could strengthen cryptocurrency's bullish trajectory.      Bitcoin was trading at a three-month high of $50,200 at press time, having recorded gains for a fifth consecutive week. That's the longest weekly winning trend since November, CoinDesk 20 data show.      ""After Jackson Hole the dollar could see some depreciation, and with institutions missing out on bitcoin in the last two weeks and now slowly coming back to work for September start, this will trigger renewed inflows into the cryptocurrency and also equity,"" Laurent Kssis, managing director of exchange-traded products at 21Shares, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, which is sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City every year, hosts prominent central bankers, finance ministers, academics and financial market participants. Until a few weeks ago, some observers were suggesting that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell would use the event to set the stage for an early scaling back of the central bank's asset-price inflating stimulus measures.      Those expectations have been watered down in recent days, with the renewed spike in coronavirus cases in the U.S. and other parts of the world, as ForexLive's Justin Low noted. The Fed may now want to gauge the impact of the virus's resurgence on the economy before signaling a taper, or winding down of stimulus.      That may revive the global macro trade of sell dollars and buy everything denominated in terms of the greenback seen in the second half of 2020.      ""We expect the Fed to remain dovish and offer no surprises,"" said Matthew Dibb, co-founder and chief operating officer at Stack Funds. ""If this is the case, we will see continued risk-on across most markets.""      Bitcoin nearly quadrupled to $40,000 in the final three months of 2020 as the dollar nosedived. The cryptocurrency reached a record high of $64,801 in April before taking a beating in May and June.      The recent bounce from July lows of below $30,000 looks impressive, considering it has happened alongside an increase in the dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback's value against major currencies.      The DXY reached a nine-month high of 93.73 on Friday and was recently at 93.25. The ascent was in part fueled by the minutes of the June Fed meeting confirming that the central bank may begin tapering later this year, as Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, noted in a blog post.      The minutes, therefore, look to have stolen some of Jackson Hole's thunder. So even a hawkish comment from Powell later this week may not significantly deteriorate the risk sentiment.      Other crypto-specific factors also support a continued rally. ""The calmness of the $50,000 break leads me to think it could be sustainable with minor setbacks,"" Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Crypto Finance, said.      The market does look calm, with the perpetual funding rate – or the average cost of holding long positions in the derivatives market – still below 0.010%, according to Glassnode. That's significantly lower than highs above 0.10% observed during the bull frenzy of the first quarter and suggests little or no speculative froth in the market.      ""Looking at funding and the options market, this rally still appears to be spot-driven,"" Dibb said. ""Our expectation is that this break of psychological resistance will likely result in a rotation back to bitcoin in the coming weeks, with the next target of $60,000.""      The cryptocurrency's rally from July lows has been backed by strong hands, according to data analytics firm IntoTheBlock.      A minor correction, however, cannot be ruled out as short-term technical indicators are pointing to overbought conditions. That may weigh heavily on alternative cryptocurrencies like solana and cardano which have outperformed bitcoin in recent days.      ""Recently the market has seen modest inflows in bitcoin but rather large exchange-traded product inflows in all other coins especially Solana, Polkadot, Cardano and, of course, ether,"" Kssis said. ""The performance is attributed to bitcoin’s rise, which may see a reset at $50,000 and a short correction before what will be anticipated inflows from institutions back in September.""

Visa bought CryptoPunk 7610 on Aug. 19, the payments technology company announced Monday.  CryptoPunks, of which 10,000 have been minted, are considered to be the original NFTs. CryptoPunk 7610 is one of 3,840 ""female"" punks.  A collection of nine rare CryptoPunks that were among the first 1,000 minted fetched almost $17 million in an auction at Christie's in May this year.  Visa's head of crypto, Cuy Sheffield, said in a blog post that the main purpose behind Visa's purchase was to learn more about the growing market. ""We think NFTs will play an important role in the future of retail, social media, entertainment and commerce,"" Sheffield wrote. ""To help our clients and partners participate, we need a firsthand understanding of the infrastructure requirements for a global brand to purchase, store, and leverage an NFT.""  He also said Visa wanted to signal its support for the creators, collectors and artists who are developing NFT commerce, as well as to “collect an NFT that symbolizes the excitement and opportunity of this particular cultural moment.”  Sheffield further compared NFTs to the early days of e-commerce in which small businesses were empowered to sell online and reach customers worldwide.

42424680,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVoNh,1629715483,Cardano Alonzo Hard Fork: What You Need to Know,"Cardano’s Alonzo update brings the network much closer to its full capabilities.      The Alonzo hard fork is a major upgrade on the Cardano network that sees the much-anticipated implementation of smart contract functionality. Smart contracts are pieces of computer code that automatically execute when certain predefined conditions are met. After the Alonzo update, anyone will be able to create and deploy their own smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain, paving the way for native decentralized applications (dapps).      The system update, which is expected to roll out fully sometime in the third quarter, signifies the end of the Shelley era of Cardano and the beginning of the Goguen phase. Although there is no set date for the end of the Alonzo hard fork, developers all across the network have been working hard on testnets and have stuck to a defined road map with specific milestones in the form of “eras.”    The eras of Cardano    Cardano’s development road map is divided into six main stages, or “eras,” each focused on expanding the functionality of the network.    Byron - Sets up the foundation code of Cardano. Allows users to exchange the ADA currency, named after revolutionary programmer Ada Lovelace, and mine ADA with their proof-of-stake consensus algorithm  Shelley - Focuses on decentralizing the network by setting up incentives for users to host their own nodes. The main goal of this era is to make sure the nodes, or individual computers, are run by a diverse group of network participants rather than a small, centralized group of users  Goguen - Introduces smart contract capabilities to the network allowing developers to create decentralized applications on top of Cardano  Basho - Improves the underlying performance of the Cardano network to be able to process more transactions and scale up. This era also introduces side chains, which is a means of scaling a network using multiple blockchains  Voltaire - Adds a voting and treasury system for self-sustaining governance. Users will be able to stake their funds to influence future development on the network    Cardano is now in the final stages of the Shelley era. This development phase added a host of new features to Cardano such as a proof-of-stake protocol known as Ouroboros, an incentives and delegation scheme that rewards participants and better hard wallet support.      By offering rewards to those who run full nodes – network participants who download the entirety of the Cardano blockchain – Cardano incentivizes network participation and encourages the growth of the Cardano network.      Since its launch on July 29, 2020, Shelley has introduced two major hard forks: Allegra and Mary. Allegra introduced a token locking mechanism that allows users to lock up Cardano tokens in preparation for on-chain voting (which is expected to roll out in Voltaire, the final development stage). Mary, on the other hand, introduced token support for Cardano’s Native Tokens (CNT). These native tokens are similar to Ethereum’s ERC token standards and enable users to create and deploy their own tokens on the Cardano blockchain, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs).      Cardano operates using its own “hard fork combinator” – a system that combines two different protocols (such as Byron and Shelley) onto a single ledger to ensure a smooth transition between phases. One problem that Cardano developers saw with hard forks was that after a hard fork was agreed upon, there would still be a considerable segment of the community that did not switch over to the new version. That may have been because they disagreed with changes or just because they didn’t bother upgrading. Either way, the combinator allows nodes to run multiple versions at once, meaning transitions are seamless and updates are frictionless. Essentially, rather than be opt-in, the updates will be opt-out.    Alonzo stages    The Alonzo hard fork is split into three main color-coded phases.    Alonzo Blue  Alonzo White  Alonzo Purple    There are also two smaller phases post-Alonzo Purple dubbed “Alonzo Red” and “Alonzo Black.” Each phase essentially adds more users to the testnet and identifies bugs that may need to be fixed.      Alonzo Blue introduced smart contracts with around 50 technical participants, mostly stake pool operators (SPOs). Invalidation errors and other simple fixes were found and tweaked during this phase. These standard bugs are expected to appear and be fixed as Alonzo goes through testing.      Alonzo White adds more features and a wider range of participants to Alonzo Blue. The hundreds of new users will be run through a sort of “exercise boot camp” that will test the capabilities of the network. This experiment is being done by IOG; the main development company behind Cardano led by former Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. The company expects this phase to last around two to four weeks.      Alonzo Purple will become a fully public testnet and on-board thousands of participants to the network. This particular stage is split into two distinct phases, “light purple” and “dark purple.” The first will allow for simple smart contracts, while the latter will allow for more complex smart contracts.      Then comes the final Alonzo Red/Alonzo Black color phases, which are reserved for final bug fixes/cleanup to prepare the final release of the hard fork. Any future tweaks to the hard fork will be very difficult to make past this point, and so it is important that these two phases are looked at very carefully.      Staging adds quality assurance, as code is frozen and exchanges are prepped for the Cardano hard fork. Alonzo Mainnet will officially launch the final code.      The Goguen Era, named after famed computer scientist Joseph Goguen, will allow for the development of dapps on the Cardano network for the first time due to Alonzo’s new smart contract capabilities. Smart contracts are the vital components of dapps that enable them to operate without intermediary entities. A smart contract building platform called The Plutus Platform is scheduled to be released during this phase and will allow both technical and non-technical users to build dapps.    What is Plutus?    Plutus uses the native Cardano programming language, Haskell. Plutus and Haskell use the same code base for off- and on-chain development. This means that at the core, the coding is identical so that there will be no complications with programming languages when developing smart contracts. That allows Plutus contracts to become even more straightforward and permits testing, which will allow developers to perfect their products for much more intensive loads such as hosting large institutions or governments.      Hoskinson, who's now the CEO of IOG, explained Haskell was chosen because it is a high- assurance code (capable of providing a higher degree of certainty the code works as intended).      Many times in the blockchain sector, code doesn’t fully match the intent of the developer and as a result, millions of dollars can be stolen or apps can break down, such as what happened when a Solidity smart contract wasn’t fully fledged out. As a result, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) project suffered a significant hack.      With Haskell, intent can better match the code as the language, although complex, was designed to be precise.    Plutus Core    Then there’s Plutus Core, which is the programming language that connects smart contracts to the Cardano final settlement layer: the Cardano blockchain. Once a developer is done creating their code with Plutus, it is compiled into Plutus Core where the code is simplified for the Cardano blockchain. This method allows Cardano to better deal with the data and to take up less disc space on the actual blockchain.      For the less-technical enthusiasts, there’s Marlowe, a new domain-specific language (DSL) that allows any user to create and test their own smart contracts without needing any advanced programming capabilities. Marlowe is built on top of Haskell and Plutus but can be thought of as building blocks for creating smart contracts.      With easier smart contract production and more development on Cardano, one can imagine the potential projects to be built. If you look at Ethereum, you can see hundreds of projects that can be redeployed, reiterated on and even improved upon on the Cardano network, including Uniswap, Aave and many more. Projects that demand faster transaction speeds will benefit greatly from the low transaction costs on Cardano. Already, more than 65 projects are pledged to be released alongside Alonzo, including Synthesis, Miniswap, Stasis and CardWallet.      The emergence of easier dapp building will bring with it more projects. In his Africa Vision video, Hoskinson mentioned these projects will eventually compete with many real-world financial institutions and aim to replace them with fairer systems, granting economic freedom to those in need.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | FORKS,"Eli Tan, Myles Sherman",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/23/cardano-alonzo-hard-fork-what-you-need-to-know,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7ad2b6c081f8b8978a52953a5da1c37fa8377998-1500x945.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The ruling contradicts one from a Shanghai court last week.    The case could set a legal precedent for crypto trading in the country, an activity that is already under intense pressure.  Other courts in China have taken a different stance, ruling that digital assets are protected as virtual property or commodities.  A court in more financially liberalized Shanghai said last week that crypto is protected as virtual property, and China's Supreme Court last year called for increased protections for virtual currencies.  In the Shandong case, the plaintiff, identified as Ma, entrusted the three defendants with 70,000 yuan (US$10,500 at the time) to invest in tokens in 2017. Soon after, Chinese authorities banned crypto trading using the yuan, and Ma's money was locked in the trading account.  The Shandong high court said that notices from the People's Bank of China, as well as the securities, banking, cyberspace and other regulators had clearly said at the time that investing in crypto tokens is illegal. Under China's civil law, the plaintiff was breaching the law and thus couldn't get his money back from the defendants.

Doh Gyu-sang, vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission, expects one or two more exchanges will register before the end of August, local media reported Friday.  Authorities have threatened to block the websites of unregistered exchanges that fail to meet the Sept. 24 deadline.  Registration has several requirements, including setting up partnerships with banks to obtain accounts for real-name verification.  While other exchanges are reportedly having difficulty persuading banks to work with them, Upbit, South Korea's largest exchange, already has a partnership with online-first K-bank for real-name verification.  Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit also have such partnerships, and so they likely will be the next ones to register.  Foreign exchanges are also under the microscope. The FIU has called on them to register as well if they provide services to South Korean consumers.  Binance limited its exposure to the market on Aug. 13, when it stopped offering trading pairs and payment options with the South Korean won.  Last week, Upbit's local operator Dunamu rolled out a product for compliance with the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force's ""travel rule"" in Singapore.

Fantom CBDC is a solution to upgrade the existing banking infrastructure. In Jan 2021, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) surveyed 65 different central banks representing around 91% of the global economy. And guess what, 56 of those 65 central banks were either researching or developing and testing CBDC solutions. What CBDCs Are and What Makes Fantom CBDC Unique Central Bank-issued Digital Currency or CBDC, as the name suggests, is a digital currency controlled and issued by central banks. We already have paper-coin currencies and blockchain-based stablecoins. So why do we need CBDCs? Cryptocurrencies and stablecoins have several benefits over fiat cash, including faster transactions, decentralization, robust security, and much more. Governments across the globe want to offer digital currencies with benefits similar to cryptocurrencies while maintaining their control to ensure consumer protection and financial stability. This is where CBDC comes into the picture. In short, CBDCs are the best of both worlds - they provide the benefits of blockchain while providing consumer protection.

Several blockchain networks today, including the popular Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, struggle with scalability issues. However, Jax.Network has established sharding as the absolute solution to this age-old problem. Using precise sharding technology allows the Jax.Network blockchain to scale the network as the demand for transactions grows. Since blockchain networks are designed to handle loads of data every second, taking 100 GB per second worth of data requires careful scalability considerations. The JaxNet protocol uses a precise sharding strategy that doesn&apos;t involve the conventional validator nodes. The decentralized sharding strategy makes Jax.Network the most promising scalability solution today, competing with Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum. Unlike Jax.Network, other networks have a lot of validators, and they need to manage them. However, multiple validators within a network are drawbacks to scalability. Jax.Nework solves this through sharding. Jax.Network employs a pure-state sharding solution. In other words, you don&apos;t have to download the whole blockchain to verify one shard. As a small node, it cuts down on your storage costs. So, at any point, any user will be able to verify his account balance, which is one of the pro points.
