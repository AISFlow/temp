42377644,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72ga7,1411158310,How Discus Fish Became China's Largest Bitcoin Mining Pool,"Mining pools serve a crucial yet relatively mundane role in the mining process by providing a focal point for hashing power and enabling small-scale miners to collaborate with others. If bitcoin mining is a competitive sport that pits miners against each other to discover new blocks and generate more bitcoins, then mining pools are the teams on which they play.  Still, despite this importance, mining pools have not been the most transparent sector of the crypto economy.  A brief look at a bitcoin mining network hash rate distribution shows three clear winners in the race to discover blocks. Joining the ranks of GHash.io, owned by exchange operator CEX.io, and a still-yet-unknown source of hashing power, China-based Discus Fish has emerged as a powerful force in the network that, to some, has been too opaque in its operation despite its size.  The pool, based in China, currently constitutes roughly 25% of the bitcoin network, and on average is the largest source of hashing power today.  This level of influence has raised concerns about a potential 51% attack, fears similar to those that ultimately forced GHash.io to take measures to reduce its hash rate.  While the pool has never amassed enough hashing power to approach that rate, Discus Fish – also known as F2Pool – could face calls to shrink in the future should it continue to grow.  Breaking the silence  CoinDesk recently spoke with Wang Chun, the pool’s co-owner and chief administrator. He described Discus Fish as a venture between two Chinese technology enthusiasts that has, over the course of its history, addressed some of the frictions in the country’s mining community.  Wang told CoinDesk that he and his business partner, digital currency entrepreneur Mao Shihang, were early adopters of the technology, but that despite early growth, mining remained a key weak point. Prior to the pool’s creation, he said, China didn’t have a locally dedicated pool.  He said:  “We both have been active in the Chinese bitcoin community since 2011. BTC China, a bitcoin exchange, was established in July 2011. But China did not have a mining pool for a long time. The founder of fxbtc.com (now closed) tried to create one of the earliest China-based pool in 2012 but ended in financial failure.”  Discus Fish opened its doors on 5th May, 2013, and in addition to its bitcoin mining power, also makes up roughly 30% of the litecoin network. Today, it sports on average 7,500 active users out of a total 100,000 registered.  According to the pool’s estimates, Discus Fish services half of China’s mining community with more than 100,000 stratum connections worldwide.  Steady growth  Prior to its formation, Wang explained, he ran a private mining farm between 2011 and 2013. This early involvement laid the foundation for what would eventually become the pool, building the expertise to manage and run a large-scale operation.  A meeting with Mao and a couple of other businessmen interested in bitcoin soon resulted in the formation of Discus Fish. Wang said that the pool discovered a block on its first day of operation, which helped it gain attention and led to an increase in its user base.  From there, the company soon branched off into related projects, including a China-based bitcoin news venture and a scrypt ASIC project called Silver Fish, which also runs a separate litecoin mining operation in addition to Discus Fish. According to Wang, these side projects are independent of Discus Fish, and the team is still focused on long-term growth.  He explained:  “F2Pool is operated independently from these new businesses. Mao is mainly working on marketing and public relationship for F2Pool, while I am focusing on the technical and financial matters.”  On the 51% issue  With a growth-oriented strategy, it seems possible that Discus Fish could continue to grow in size and influence relative to the overall size of the network.  Discus Fish dismissed the issue as one not worth focusing on at this time. When asked whether Discus Fish would ever take action if its total bitcoin hash rate approached or exceeded 50%, Wang said that the public perception of the issue is not fully aligned with reality.  Citing data from Blockchain, he said that many large pools rarely rise above 40% for long, and noted that those metrics are not always accurate. He argued that it would be difficult for Discus Fish to reach that level today, but added that if that were to happen, the company would consider mitigation efforts such as raising fees to dissuade miners.  Wang remarked:  “If we do [see a significantly higher hash rate], we may consider increasing our fee make some miners leave for other pools.”  Looking ahead  Though well-positioned currently, Discus Fish highlighted the emergence of new pools both within China’s bitcoin and litecoin mining communities and abroad as a potential long-term concern.  However, Wang stopped short of speculating on the future of Discus Fish, saying:  “Pools come and go. We all remember Deepbit, and others. It is hard to say anything one year from now.”  He added that “we must constantly improve our service” in order to stay competitive in a global market of miners always on the lookout for better – and more profitable – mining pools.  When asked about the future of Chinese bitcoin regulation as it pertains to Discus Fish, Wang said that he hopes that pools will be allowed to continue serving their function in the mining network.  Wang cited the fact that pools don’t touch government-backed currencies as reason for the sector to be lightly regulated. But given the fact that mining pools form are a kind of utility in the space, it remains unclear how regulators will approach the business model moving forward.  “Mining pools do not involve fiat money. I think it should not be a bigger target of the regulators than an exchange,” he concluded.

42377646,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72gYr,1411149668,Bitcoin Foundation Bangladesh Suspends Operations,"The Bitcoin Foundation has issued a new statement suggesting that it is currently investigating whether bitcoin and digital currency transactions are now illegal in Bangladesh.  However, citing general uncertainty surrounding this week's statements from the Bangladesh Bank, the Bitcoin Foundation Bangladesh, the organisation's first Asia-based affiliate, will suspend operations.  In a post entitled "" The Case for Bitcoin in Bangladeshhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/09/the-case-for-bitcoin-in-bangladesh/"", executive director Jon Matonis suggested that the comments from the bank don't read like other bitcoin bans. This perception has proliferated since earlier this week, when Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported the South Asian nation's central bank had stated that using bitcoin is a ""punishable offense"".  Matonis took aim at the article which he called ""misleading"". Further, he updated the community on the work the Bitcoin Foundation has been conducting since the initial report, clarifying that the original statement is a ""standard issue of caution"", similar to others that have been issued by many countries globally.  Matonis wrote:  ""The Bangladesh Central Bank is alerting consumers of the risks involved with using bitcoin and reminding them that bitcoin is not government issued or sanctioned.""  Matonis went on to affirm that bitcoin's use is not prohibited by domestic laws such as the Foreign Currency Control Act of 1947 and the Money Laundering Control Act of 2012, though those who seek to use bitcoin for illicit transactions are punishable under these regulations.  Uncertainty remains  Still, Matonis suggested that the organisation continues to seek clarity on the additional implications of the law.  ""What has been left unclear is if there are any other official statements or conditions under which transacting or even educating others on bitcoin could be considered a punishable offense,"" he added.  In the meantime, the Bitcoin Foundation Bangladesh has updated its official website to include an English-language statement addressing the country's central bank.  ""We respect our country's specific laws regarding this issue and oblige thereby,"" the statement reads.  A sensible approach  In his remarks, Matonis went on to confirm his organisation's stance that bitcoin is an emerging technology that brings real risks to users, though it holds long-term promise that could drastically impact global finance.  Further, he argued Bangladesh would be wise to consider how bitcoin may be able to address some of its own economic issues, stating:  ""The sensible approach for Bangladesh is to understand and examine bitcoin and its promise for improving lives of its citizens, creating jobs and economic opportunity.""  In particular, he cited bitcoin's potential ability to lower costs in the remittance market. A popular financial tool in Bangladesh, residents receive roughly $14.5bn through remittance services annually.  Correction: A previous version of this article suggested that the Bitcoin Foundation had said that bitcoin is not illegal in Bangladesh. The organisation is currently seeking more clarity on this issue.

42377645,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72gV5,1411140621,Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme Perpetrator Fined $40 Million,"A Texas man charged with defrauding consumers through an illicit investment vehicle has been ordered to pay more than $40m in fines by a federal judge.  The Thursday ruling brought to close a case launched last July that drew headlines at a time when many in the mainstream US media were only first learning about bitcoin and its related technology.  Trendon Shavers, the founder and operator of Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BTCST) had reportedly accrued more than 700,000 BTC in customer funds, worth roughly $64m at the time of his arrest.  US Magistrate Judge Amos Mazzant wrote:  ""The uncontested summary judgment evidence establishes that Shavers knowingly and intentionally operated BTCST as a sham and a Ponzi scheme, repeatedly making misrepresentations to BTCST investors and potential investors concerning the use of their bitcoins, how he would generate the promised returns, and the safety of the investments.""  Notably, many subsequent government warnings by US regulators, both on the state and local levels, cautioned against bitcoin's potential use in Ponzi schemes.  Nonetheless, Shavers' actions were widely denounced in the community, including the Bitcoin Foundation's general counsel Patrick Murck.  Legal findings  Judge Mazzant found that Shavers violated securities laws by selling fraudulent bitcoin investments to consumers and using the funds of new investors to reimburse older investors.  Shavers, who was not represented by a lawyer during the trial, countered these allegations by arguing that BTCST was not subject to US securities laws that prohibit Ponzi schemes, due to the fact that bitcoin is not considered money under federal law.  Judge Mazzant ruled differently, ultimately determining that investments made to BTCST met all the requrements of investment secuities and therefore were subject to their related laws.  Shavers was eventually charged with violating anti-fraud and securities laws in a complaint filed in the US District Court Eastern District of Texas.  Calculating the damages  Perhaps most notable were the methods the US court used to calculate the damages in the case, given that the price of bitcoin is prone to fluctuations.  The fine was determined based on the average daily price of bitcoin on 26th August, 2012 when the scheme was uncovered, and includes $38.6m in profits BTCST earned fraudulently, associated interest of $1.8m as well as a $150,000 civil fine awarded to Shavers.  At a press time price of $399.02, the 700,000 BTC Shavers earned from investors is worth roughly $279m.

42377640,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72gSZ,1411136351,Bitcoin Foundation Hires Regulatory Expert for EU Policy Push,"The Bitcoin Foundation has been ramping up its lobbying efforts in the US since July, most notably with the hiring of Washington, DC-based firm Thorsen French Advocacy. Now, the organisation is making a similar push to promote the digital currency in Europe.  The foundation announced today that it has retained regulatory expert Monica Monaco to directly promote the digital currency with political leaders and policymakers in the European Union (EU).  This is the first time the an external expert has been directly hired in this way in the EU, where the foundation normally relies on the advocacy efforts of its members.  Brussels-based Monica Monaco, who is founder and managing director of TRUST EU Affairs, was a senior manager for EU relations and regulatory affairs in the legal department of VISA Europe for more than 10 years.  As well as a legal and economic background, Monaco brings to the role a knowledge of payment systems, consumer credit, e-commerce and financial education, which she will utilise to help the foundation ""protect and promote"" bitcoin in Europe.  Trust EU Affairs is a regulatory affairs consultancy specialising in financial services legislation at the European Union level.  New direction  Bitcoin Foundation executive director Jon Matonis told CoinDesk that Monaco would be a valuable addition to the foundation, saying:  ""Through her experience with Visa and financial clearing networks, Monica brings a wealth of knowledge and important contacts to the Bitcoin Foundation.""  He added, Monaco's role will also include strategic coordination with local affiliate chapters. Additionally, the foundation plans on launching an EU regulatory affairs committee, similar to the one headed by Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman attorney Marco Santori in the US.  Through its collaboration with TRUST EU Affairs, the Bitcoin Foundation aims to ""continue to expand awareness and recognition of the bitcoin community, the bitcoin protocol, and its benefits"".  The primary goal, the organisation says, is to discourage uninformed negative treatment of bitcoin and to lay the groundwork for law and policy changes that both maintain bitcoin’s independence and permit its fuller integration into mainstream financial services systems.  Perfect timing  Jim Harper, Global Policy Counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, argued that the move comes at the right time for the organisation, saying:  “As we've been doing in the US, we'll be introducing the foundation, educating policymakers about bitcoin and sharing bitcoin’s achievements and potential in terms of financial inclusion with leading policymakers and public officials.""  Matonis explained that retaining Monaco represents an extension of the foundation's general strategy, and ""internationalizes its educational and existing policy efforts"", adding:  ""Bitcoin is global and so is the foundation.""  Today's news raises the prospect of other regions being given their own Bitcoin Foundation representative to push the case for bitcoin.  ""The Eurozone and the UK are first,"" Matonis said, ""but other significant regions for bitcoin will be looked at on a case-by-case basis.""

42377651,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72ghf,1411128403,"Study: Illicit Goods Use, Age and Politics Predict Bitcoin Holdings","If you're in your 30s, love to shop on Silk Road 2.0 and live outside the US, then chances are, you're a pretty big bitcoin user. That's what a new study delving into the profile of bitcoiners has found.  The study, titled 'Who Uses Bitcoin? An Exploration of the Bitcoin Community' is by Jeremiah Bohr and Masooda Bashir at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Bohr is a visiting assistant professor at the university's sociology department and Bashir is director of social sciences research at the university's engineering school. The paper was first presented at the Privacy, Security and Trust conference in July.  The authors use statistical modelling to crunch the numbers from a survey conducted last year by Lúí Smyth, who was a digital anthropology researcher at University College London but now runs CoinJar's UK operations.  Who has lots of bitcoin?  Smyth's survey asked respondents how many bitcoins they held. Bohr and Bashir took this information and tried to find relationships between the number of bitcoin held and other factors, such as age, or whether respondents were active on bitcoin community forums.  Bohr and Bashir found that age was a statistically significant factor in predicting the amount of bitcoin a respondent held. Respondents with the most bitcoins were aged between 55 and 60 years old. Younger respondents had fewer bitcoins, although the amount generally doubled every 10 years. At age 60, bitcoin holdings drop off, which fits the pattern of asset accumulation across other asset classes, the researchers found.  ""The marginal effects of age on bitcoin accumulation slow down and then decline,"" the authors write.  Another attribute that predicts bitcoin holdings is a user's degree of sociability on various bitcoin-specific platforms like the Bitcoin Talk forum, dedicated IRC channels, or the r/bitcoin sub-Reddit. Those who actively participated in bitcoin online communities owned twice as much bitcoin as those who kept mum about their cryptocurrency activities online, the authors found.  Perhaps controversially for those seeking to position bitcoin as a mainstream financial technology, the research found that users who spent bitcoin on illegal goods had significantly more bitcoins than those who didn't. Users who purchased illicit goods, such as narcotics, had up to 45% more bitcoin holdings than those who stuck strictly to goods that wouldn't get them in trouble with the law.  Price optimism  The researchers also considered the effect of age and other factors on respondents' expectations on the bitcoin price. Older users were less optimistic than younger users, with optimism about the long-term bitcoin price peaking at about age 35, and then tailing off. The ""long-term"" price is defined in the survey as the price on 3rd January 2019, or six years from the time of the survey.  Other factors that were positively correlated with price optimism were the level of social engagement on forums and other platforms and the timing of a user's installation of the bitcoin client. The more recently bitcoin was installed, the greater the users optimism about bitcoin's near-term price. In the survey, the ""near-term"" was defined as 3rd July 2013, or four months from the survey's start.  Politics and bitcoin  Smyth's survey concluded with an open-ended question, asking respondents to describe their ""favourite aspect"" of bitcoin in about 140 characters. Bohr and Bashir crunched these responses and grouped them into themes. They then related these themes to the respondents' self-identified political leanings and other factors from the survey including age and respondents' country of residence.  Bohr and Bashir grouped responses into themes related to anonymity, freedom and the banking system. They found political identity was not a factor in predicting whether respondents valued bitcoin for its anonymity. The only factor that suggested a preference for anonymity was whether a user was a miner or not.  Respondents who favoured bitcoin for its potential to disrupt the banking system were found to be above the age of 40, residing outside the US and identified themselves politically as greens. In fact, greens were three times as likely as centrists, conservatives and libertarians to favour bitcoin, because of its critique of the modern banking industry. A sample comment from a 34-year-old in Norway reads:  ""The current monetary system is a fraud based on an old scam. Bitcoins are open, free and not a scam.""  Unsurprisingly, users who like bitcoin for its freedom-promoting qualities were found to politically identify as libertarian, residing outside the US and aged between 30 and 39. One of the freedom-loving comments, from a 28-year-old in Argentina, reads:  ""Freedom! Nobody can forbid me to buy/sell bitcoins, there's no government regulations on that.""  Research caveats  The authors note that their findings should be viewed with a few caveats in mind. The survey results were collected before the implosion of the now bankrupt exchange Mt. Gox, which lost hundreds of thousands of coins when it went under.  ""Future data collection may reveal sharp changes in attitudes of behaviours within the bitcoin community,"" the authors write.  The authors also highlight the fact that the survey represents only the English-speaking bitcoin community and that bitcoin's pseudonymous nature poses challenges to the collection of a random global sample. The researchers noted that no gender differentiation was required in the analysis because 95% of respondents said they were men.

42377649,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72gdt,1411118977,OKCoin Introduces Multiple Balances for Trading Flexibility,"OKCoin yesterday added a new 'margin management' system to its recently launched Futures trading platform, allowing multiple margin balances for a trader's different positions.  Margin management replaces a previous system which allowed only a single margin balance for all positions held. This meant that gains and losses of individual positions had the potential to impact each other by drawing on the same margin balance.  An OKCoin representative said:  ""As a pioneer of crypto-futures trading, OKCoin has devoted time to refining its platform to accommodate the most sophisticated traders in the market. With that in mind, we have been working over the past month to bring to life our new margin management system.""  Isolating risk  It is common practice amongst traders to have multiple positions open simultaneously, with some advanced users preferring to manage the amount of risk that they bear for each individual position.  OKCoin said some traders find that a one-size-fits-all margin system with a single balance lacks flexibility.  The exchange's solution was to utilize a system called 'fixed margin'. Under this system, traders' positions are grouped into four types according to contract lengths: weekly, biweekly, monthly, and quarterly.  Contracts of each type are designated a fixed amount of margin the trader can then add to or reduce as needed.  The advantage of the new system is that if a position or positions turn bad, the impact will be contained, effectively isolating the risk.  While the new system affords traders more control, the original single-balance option will still be available for those who prefer it.  International expansion  Like its Chinese exchange competitors, OKCoin has diversified its feature list in recent months to appeal to a more professional trading market and an international user base.  OKCoin manager of international operations Zane Tackett told CoinDesk the new features have been instrumental in the company's expansion.  He said:  ""Initially our Futures user base was mostly Chinese, coming over from the .cn site or 796, but since we've started promoting internationally, we've seen the international customer base grow much faster than our Chinese user base.""  OKCoin re-launched its margin trading system in June, shortly after a new English language version of its website went live.  The re-launch was designed to comply with People's Bank of China (PBOC) advice to reduce the risk of speculative activity, after OKCoin had halted an earlier margin lending and trading system in May.  In August, the firm added the Futures trading platform, which it said solved some of bitcoin's price volatility issues by 'locking in' the price at a set level.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/19/okcoin-introduces-multiple-balances-for-trading-flexibility,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c430d2e1af5638d6ef05f004111331bcc2dd1db5-2560x1904.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377647,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72gbN,1411094684,Downward Pressures Persist as Bitcoin's Price Declines to Near $400,"The price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) declined today from a near-open high of $455.24 to a low of $405.72 at 19:35 UTC, before eventually recovering to a press-time value of $421.42.  Prices were similarly affected on the CoinDesk CNY Bitcoin Price Index, which hit a high of ¥2,824.17, before falling 7% to a daily low of ¥2,517.74.  The turbulent day is the latest blow to the price of bitcoin, which has been in unsteady decline since July. Then, optimism was high New York's proposed bitcoin regulations would usher in a new era of legitimacy for bitcoin businesses, however, a reversal of this sentiment has since given way to concerns about overall merchant bitcoin adoption and industrial mining, and their effects on the market.  Larger arguments aside, Raffael Danielli, who runs quantitative analysis blog Matlab Trading, sees the day's decline as the result of protective and pragmatic maneuvers by the market's many more active traders.  Danielli told CoinDesk:  ""I think today was more of a technical move. Many traders probably had $450 as their lower bound exit point, and so they got out.""  While straightforward, the explanation is just one of many that proliferated throughout the bitcoin community during the day's trading.  OTC and miner trading  The day's price action provided additional fuel to the ongoing debate over whether the more widespread merchant adoption of bitcoin has lead to a weakening of demand in bitcoin's markets.  Payza  business consultant Charlie Shrem took to Reddit to rebuff this theory, asserting that since much of this selling happens outside major exchanges, or over the counter (OTC) where exchange prices are used as a guide, this trading has little impact on the listing price on major order books.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Tim Swanson, author the new book The Anatomy of a Money-like Informational Commodity, offered an opposing view, asserting:  ""That is what we are seeing now – it may not matter how many people are 'buying off-chain' or 'off-market' because no one wants to lose money.""  Swanson went on to suggest that OTC traders may be weakening buying pressure, but that other factors should not be discounted. For instance, he cited the need for bitcoin miners to sell bitcoins at high prices to support their operations, and similar recent observations from cryptonomics writer Robert Sams.  ""[Bitcoin] is only as valuable as another party is willing to pay for it,"" he added as a reminder.  Merchant market affects  Danielli suggested that merchant adoption may indeed be having an effect on the market, an opinion that is now widely debated in the community.  These market observers point to the fact that though more merchants are accepting bitcoin payments, they are not holding these funds in bitcoin. Thus, they argue, the market is not attracting enough buyers to absorb these bitcoins on the open market.  However, Danielli took this argument a step further, suggesting that this influence is measurable when comparing bitcoin to the second most popular cryptocurrency, litecoin.  For example, he pointed to the difference between performance in the bitcoin and litecoin markets, noting that when bitcoin had fallen 7.5% during the day's trading, litecoin had declined only 5%.  Cautioning that his observations were only speculation, he added:  ""Given that those two coins are mostly the same (professional miners, increasing difficulty, ability to short, available on many exchanges) except that bitcoin can be more easily spend relative to litecoin you could say that merchants might account for around 2.5 percentage points of today's drop with miners and traders sharing the other 5 percentage point.""  Danielli added that he believes merchant adoption is positive for bitcoin's long-term price performance, but that given the current general downward trend, it may be detrimental near term.  Further price weakening predicted  In the absence of any larger, positive news, Danielli and Swanson cautioned against speculative answers to the price decline, but suggested that all factors, as well as the perception of these factors, were contributing to the overall down trend.  Danielli added that bearish sentiment could continue, especially as the calendar advances toward the anniversaries of bitcoin's 2013 highs.  ""Year-over-year we are still up,"" he said. ""It will interesting to see what happens around November when year-over-year might turn negative.""  An informal poll on Reddit suggested this sentiment persisted among traders, with a leading 28% reporting they believe bitcoin's price will decline to the $350–$400 range in the coming weeks.
