42426820,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwndh,1461186960,Trailer for Unreleased TV Drama Highlights Digital Currency’s Seedier Side,"A new trailer for a TV drama called “StartUp” suggests the upcoming series to appear on Netflix-competitor Crackle will feature a heavy emphasis on “digital currency”.  Starring notable actors including Fargo’s Martin Freeman and The OC’s Adam Brody, ""StartUp"" centers around an idea for an ""unregulated digital currency"" and includes content that may sound familiar to those used to hearing product pitches from the bitcoin community.  As seen in the trailer, the series, set in Miami, focuses on actress Otmara Marrero (who plays Izzy Morales, the head of a digital currency startup called GenCoin) and actors Edi Gathegi (a gang leader named Ronald Dacey); Martin Freeman (portraying FBI agent Phil Rask); and Adam Brody (an investor with something to hide).  Of particular note are voiceovers that suggest that the GenCoin digital currency is ""untraceable"" and ""unregulated"", as well as lines from characters that seem to highlight the value propositions of the technology.  No mention is made as to whether GenCoin is built on a blockchain-based network. Similarly, no mention of bitcoin is made.  Still, the similarities are already drawing comment from the bitcoin community due to the prominent and negative connotations to digital currency and its connection to crime. More positive value propositions for digital currencies are included in the trailer.  For example, when Morales gives the pitch for the GenCoin startup, she states:  ""50% of the world’s population doesn’t have a bank account, but almost all of them have a cell phone. That’s GenCoin.""  Later, Brody’s character is seen defending the digital currency from criticism that no one will use the technology, while Morales calls the currency ""the future of crime and the future of commerce"".  The 10-episode series is scheduled to debut on Crackle this Fall.

42426817,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnZh,1461180688,Unlicensed Bitcoin Exchange Operators Plead Guilty in Louisiana,"A Louisiana man and his son have plead guilty to running an unlicensed bitcoin exchange, the US Department of Justice said today.  According to the Justice Department, Randall Lord and his son, Michael, plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money services business. Further, the Lords allegedly failed to report cash receipts in excess of $10,000.  The elder Lord also plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to distribute the anti-anxiety medication alprazolam.  The Justice Department said in a statement:  “According to the guilty plea, from at least 2013 to 2015, the defendants were accepting currency, money orders and MoneyPaks and exchanging those funds for bitcoin, a decentralized form of electronic or digital currency, existing entirely on the Internet and not in any physical form. Contrary to law, the Lords were not registered with FinCEN or licensed to operate as a money service business with the State of Louisiana.”  The two face as many as five years in prison for the money services business charge, and Randall Lord could be sentenced to an additional five years on the drug charge. The two could also be sentenced with three years of supervised release and as much as $250,000 in fines.  Sentencing is set to take place in August.

42426814,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnPh,1461179762,SWIFT is Now Developing a Distributed Ledger Platform,"A new report from SWIFT details the settlement network operator's plan to develop a distributed ledger application platform.  The 20-page report  , which was the result of research and development between SWIFT and professional services firm Accenture, includes new details on SWIFT’s proofs-of-concept focused on the technology. These include how it working on transaction settlement and identity management concepts that incorporate blockchain elements.  Notably, the paper outlines SWIFT's intention to create ""a distinctive [distributed ledger technology] DLT platform"" focused on financial applications, that it suggested it will build in collaboration with industry peers.  The paper's authors wrote:  ""Drawing upon its long history of fostering industry collaboration, SWIFT will leverage its unique set of capabilities – unrivaled standards expertise and track record in security as well as our strong governance, operational efficiency, reliability and reach – to deliver a distinctive DLT platform offer for the benefit of its community.""  Further, the paper argues that applications among financial institutions hinge on development in the areas of governance, data control, compliance, standards, identity, security, scalability and overall reliability.  Proofs-of-concept detailed  To date, some of SWIFT’s most visible work on blockchain applications comes as part of the Hyperledger project, the open-source initiative led by the Linux Foundation.  But, the paper offers a look at some of the other trials being conducted by the network in its innovation labs, including applications focused on identity and settlement.  One application described as an ""Identity and Access Management"" concept, for example, uses a distributed ledger.  ""This PoC integrates a DLT solution with a SWIFTNet PKI solution and access control mechanism (such as a closed user group and RMA) to demonstrate how SWIFT can leverage its existing platform and assets to solve the identity and access management issues highlighted as part of our technology assessment,"" the paper states.  According to SWIFT, these PoCs will play a role in the platform it seeks to build.  ""The areas covered in the PoCs should be considered as illustrative to prove the capabilities of the technology and support SWIFT’s work to build a DLT platform which is standardised and use case agnostic,"" the company said.  Push for collaboration  Throughout the report, SWIFT and Accenture push for industry stakeholders to work collaboratively on blockchain applications. This, the argument goes, will ensure the greatest degree of interoperability between networks and institutions running their own ledgers.  ""It is clear that industry-standard DLTs should be developed collaboratively with the industry in order to ensure the technology can be universally adopted,"" the paper states.  One angle of this issue, according to the paper, lies in the area of reducing costs and overall risks for those involved with development and deploying applications.  ""At the request of its community, SWIFT is heavily investing in building a complete compliance portfolio for its community. Compliance is a challenge shared by all financial institutions, and one that is best met together,"" the paper states, concluding:  ""Since investments in financial crime compliance do not yield competitive advantage, it makes sense to collaborate to mitigate costs and risks for all parties.""

42426818,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnbh,1461177288,Digital Asset Holdings Acqui-Hires Smart Contract Startup,"Digital Asset Holdings has announced that it has acquired the assets and senior leadership of a Zurich-based technology startup.  Elevence CEO Vincent Peikert will lead Digital Asset's Switzerland office, and serve as head of product for Europe. Further, James Litsios, Elevence's CTO, will serve as head of development in Switzerland. The terms of the acqui-hire were not disclosed.  In the statement posted to Digital Asset’s website, CEO Blythe Masters described how she sees Elevence’s eight-person team fitting into the company.  Masters said:  ""The resulting Digital Asset platform is specifically designed to address financial services applications requiring automation, privacy and immutability.""  The acquisition represents the fourth blockchain startup purchased by the New York-based Digital Asset. In the past year, Digital Asset has moved to acquire startups Hyperledger, Bits of Proof, and Blockstack.io.  Privacy focus  Founded in 2015, Zürich-based Elevence has been working to write a coding language specifically designed to model and execute financial agreements using a distributed ledger, while at the same time giving parties involved more control over who can see the information provided.  According to the announcement, Elevence has developed a modeling language to express ""any right or obligation"", including cash, securities and derivatives. The company’s code defines the considerations between parties to determine how contractual relations might change over time.  ""This provides relevant parties with a unified view of current and future rights and obligations on a need-to-know basis, rather than revealing confidential information as in smart contract systems,"" Digital Asset explained.  Blockchain or distributed ledger?  Today's announcement also provided more evidence of what increasingly looks like an industry-wide shift away from the term ""blockchain"" to the term ""distributed ledger"".  Earlier this month, banking consortium R3CEV announced its own distributed ledger platform, dubbed 'Corda', which the company described as being built from the ground up with user privacy in mind. At the time, R3 sought to distinguish its new platform from blockchain, the distributed database that underlies bitcoin and other digital currencies.  Similarly, today's formal announcement continued the company's tendency to make no mention of the word ""blockchain,"" but described the technology as a ""distributed ledger"" on five separate occasions.

42426825,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnnh,1461164916,Payments Firm Qiwi Wants to Launch Russia's R3CEV,"Russian payments provider Qiwi has revealed it wants to launch a domestic blockchain consortium it compared to the 44-member banking consortium R3CEV.  In statements today, Qiwi CTO Alexei Arkhipov expanded on his company’s work with blockchain tech, reiterating how the company has developed its own prototypes for payments processing. Originally nicknamed ‘BitRuble’, the project caused concern among local regulators, who have been moving to formally ban the use of blockchain-based digital currencies.  Arkhipov, however, said that sentiment regarding the technology is now changing, and that Qiwi is looking to create a consortium of regional banks, financial institutions and enterprise businesses that could band together to further explore the emerging technology.  Arkhipov said:  ""We see that the debate on the blockchain in Russia has become more substantive and constructive. By ​​creating a consortium similar to R3 ... many companies will have the opportunity not only to investigate but also to test existing prototypes.""  If successful, the effort would mirror similar work underway globally. For example, the Dubai government announced the creation of the Global Blockchain Council (GBC) in May, a 30-member group of tech businesses, startups and government agencies.  To date, R3 has been perhaps the most visible of these efforts, uniting 44 global financial institutions on trials that have so far replicated commercial paper trading and trialed private versions of blockchain technology from the Ethereum project.

42426828,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnvh,1461163525,Fidor Bank Veteran Joins Kraken as Senior Legal Counsel,"Kraken has hired Edward Stadum from Fidor Bank to help oversee the increasingly complicated legal work related to running a global digital currency exchange.  In interview, Stadum said he left the Germany-based Fidor on good terms, explaining that his new position overseeing Kraken’s legal work in Asia, Europe, the US and beyond stands to benefit both companies.  He told CoinDesk:  ""There’s a very important working relationship that involved Fidor providing banking account support to Kraken customers in the EU. And that’s important business for them both.""  Stadum will work ""with particular emphasis"" on San Francisco-based Kraken’s best business practices, corporate governance, finance, acquisitions, strategy, technology and regulation. Previously, he served as US general counsel for Fidor.  Ransomware a top priority  As general counsel, Stadum's first priority going forward is helping Kraken deal with numerous requests by users who want to create accounts for the purpose of buying bitcoin to pay off ransomware, a cyberattack during which hackers freeze computer assets and demand payment in bitcoin before they restore access.  Some of these customers, Stadum suggested yesterday, have come to Kraken after being denied service by other bitcoin exchanges.  “A request came into us just today from someone who said he needed bitcoin to pay ransomware and he’s gone to several exchanges and been denied,” he added.  Among his other duties, Stadum will help Kraken look into the potential legal implications of knowingly setting up accounts for the specific purpose of paying ransom requests.  Stadum said:  ""This poses some potential interesting challenges for a bitcoin company for whether it can or should provide bitcoin for such a purpose. This is something that's coming at us right now and is a perfect example of what I'll be doing as the general counsel.""  A continuing partnership  Stadum tells CoinDesk that he was originally commissioned by Kraken to write a report on certain aspects of the company’s legal matters, a process during which he concluded ""that Kraken badly needed a good general counsel.""  ""Ed wanted to join the team after seeing what was ‘under the hood’ while conducting an audit of Kraken,"" founder and CEO Jesse Powell said in a statement. ""In fact, having a window into how things work at Kraken made him even more interested in joining our exchange.""

42426815,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwnVh,1461157333,Insurance Giant John Hancock Begins Blockchain Tech Tests,"Life insurance and financial services giant John Hancock has begun work on multiple blockchain proofs-of-concept designed to show how distributed ledger technology could reinvent established insurance industry processes.  But, as yet, the proofs-of-concept aren’t actually related to insurance. Instead, the company that last year doled out $24.6bn in customer claims is exploring blockchain in a wide-range of areas of the business, with actual insurance applications only to come in the future.  John Hancock’s head of innovation, Ace Moghimi, said his team was working on several blockchain applications aimed specifically at making the company more transparent and more efficient.  Moghimi told CoinDesk:  ""Usually we’ll start with a customer need or a business problem we’re trying to solve. But for blockchain, we were looking at the impact of what this tech could have on our operational efficiency and effectiveness.""  Specifically, Moghimi said John Hancock, the US name for Canada-based Manulife, is working on a know-your-customer (KYC) trial, something in its legal department and a project to streamline back-office operations.  POCs explored  However, the proof-of-concept Mohmini was most excited about was in the area of employee rewards, or creating an incentive program around blockchain.  ""When you think about the aspect about how mining occurs and transactions go though the network, there’s some interesting dynamics there that you can gamify,"" Moghimi said.  Each proof-of-concept is being built out of the company’s Lab of Forward Thinking (LOFT) in Boston, Massachusetts. Established in May 2015 and launched in July, LOFT was created to enable employees to develop new technologies related to insurance as well as wealth and asset management.  Internal brainstorming sessions at LOFT, Moghimi said, resulted in several possible use cases, which led the team to meet with representatives of ConsenSys Enterprise and BlockApps, two startups working on the Ethereum blockchain.  ConsenSys Enterprise lead technical developer, Igor Lilic, said that when his company first met with Moghimi and the rest of the LOFT team in person, they were already well-advanced in their blockchain research.  Lilic described how Consensys Enterprise is working with LOFT to build the prototypes:  ""They are a team that has a mandate toward innovation so they have spent time understanding the blockchain technology, mapping out various use cases that made sense to them. And then as a team, we worked together closely to move through those use cases.""  Blockchain and insurance  John Hancock offers and administers a wide range of financial products, including life insurance, annuities, investments, 401(k) plans, long-term care insurance, college savings and other forms of business insurance.  While the company isn’t sharing details around its proofs-of-concept, earlier this year ‘Big Four’ accounting firm Ernst & Young published a report listing peer-to-peer insurance and faster distribution of “regionalized or personalized” products among its list of opportunities for insurers using blockchain.  Other possible applications according to the report include fraud detection through creating a decentralized repository of customer information and policies; digital claims management through providing historical third-party transaction data; types of distribution using micro-insurance and micro-finance; and new kinds of products around ""cyber liability"" for security professionals.  But, not all considerations mentioned in the report were positive.  Among the concerns EY notes is a potential for blockchain to increase the liability to both insurers and brokers, and that such adoption “creates the need” for new regulation.  From the report:  ""As society becomes increasingly digital and distribution channels more varied and complex, customers have higher expectations in choice of product or insurer. When certain aspects of the value chain become more commoditized, as a result, a customer bases a choice entirely on the availability of brand information and transparency of the insurer’s performance. The integrity, controls and transparency of insurers’ business processes, reinforced by recent trends in regulation, must be geared toward protecting the customer experience. Unless insurers are prepared to innovate, either customers or regulators will force them to change.""  Last year Ernst & Young placed insurance companies among the least trusted types of companies, with just 56% of people saying they trusted them. For some comparison, supermarkets were the most-trusted companies with 85% of people reporting a strong belief in these brands.  Baby steps  For the time being, the blockchain group at John Hancock's LOFT consists of four people currently working on a minimum viable product for the employee rewards application of blockchain technology.  Moghimi said he was unable to share the details of the application, but did elaborate on what its next steps are.  When the MVP is released in about a month's time, it will conclude the education and platform-building phase of the team's work with ConsenSys Enterprise and BlockApps. The next phase of the work will focus around tapping into ConsenSys Enterprise consultancy services and identifying broader use-cases of the work.  All of this, though, is just the beginning of a much larger project to build blockchain into John Hancock's actual insurance services — a process still in its early days for the massive industry.  In the US alone, the insurance industry including life, health, property and casualty insurance generated a total of $1.04tn, according to the most recent US Treasury report, a 4% increase from the year before.  Before an industry with that much momentum can bring about a significant change of course, Moghimi says industry leaders will have to get involved.  He concluded:  ""It all really depends on how regulations go to. We’re still talking about a tech that’s very risky from that perspective. Once that gets figured out, you’ll see the technology becoming more ubiquitous.""
