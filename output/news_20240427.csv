EGRAG, a cryptocurrency expert, has made one of these positive forecasts, which is that there will be a price spike of tremendous magnitude. According to the analyst‚Äôs recent post on social media, XRP could reach the $4 price level over the long term. Crypto Analyst Predicts 700% Bullish XRP Price Action XRP has experienced a small decline in value over the past few days as the entire crypto market consolidates in price action. XRP‚Äôs price movement this year has largely left many of its fervent enthusiasts feeling disappointed, particularly considering the fact that it is yet to reach the $1 mark as predicted by many analysts. Related Reading: Brace For Price Impact: Dogecoin Whales Move Massive 456 Million DOGE To Exchanges Data from Coinmarketcap shows XRP now finds itself bouncing around at the $0.51 price mark after retesting the $0.435 on April 13. However, according to EGRAG, this is poised to change soon. EGRAG, known for this very bullish stance on XRP, recently noted in his analysis that the current XRP price movement mimics the 2021 move which saw it breaking as high as $1.8. According to his analysis, EGRAG divided the price outlook into two sections blue and yellow, each depicting mirror images of 2021 price movement. #XRP Imitating 2021 ‚Äì Move: üîµ Blue Section: The current trajectory suggests a possible reach of $1.4 by June-July, a key target. The price range between ($1.2 ‚Äì $1.8) is a plausible target. üü° Yellow Section: Aiming for $4 is feasible if we follow a similar path to 2021.‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/BMUJSbb5GQ ‚Äî EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) April 25, 2024 The blue section is more of a narrow price trajectory which suggests that XRP could reach $1.4 by June or July, with a price range between $1.2 to $1.8. Meanwhile, the yellow section is a more bullish price trajectory. According to the analyst, XRP could reach the $4 price level by June or July if it follows the yellow section of 2021‚Äôs movement. Interestingly, a surge to the $4 price level would put the price of XRP at a new all-time high. What‚Äôs Next For XRP? EGRAG is one of the many crypto analysts who are still bullish on XRP‚Äôs price trajectory. His long-term price projection for XRP is $27, which he believes is still viable. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.5148, down by 16.8% in the past 30 days. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive Move For Bitcoin, What‚Äôs The Target? This means in order to reach $4 in July, the bulls will have to push the crypto on a 677% increase in less than three months. Although the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies suggests this price run is possible, current market dynamics point to modest XRP price gains at best. On the other hand, on-chain metrics have revealed that a bullish sentiment might be returning to XRP. Notably, the amount of XRP wallets holding at least 1 million coins has been surging recently, which could be a signal of a coming price surge.

26466353,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605415,1714240830,"Expert Says Bitcoin Price Has Topped And Is In Exponential Decay, Why This Is Not A Bad Thing","Crypto expert Peter Brandt has boldly claimed that the Bitcoin top for this market cycle may already be in. He made this conclusion based on his ‚Äúexponential decay‚Äù thesis, which he noted may actually be good for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Why Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Has Topped Brandt explained that historical data suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs price has topped. He further alluded to an ‚Äúexponential decay,‚Äù which he noted could be used to describe Bitcoin. Brandt‚Äôs exponential decay thesis is based on the fact that Bitcoin‚Äôs percentage gain has significantly reduced in every subsequent bull cycle. Related Reading: Ethereum Withdrawals From Exchanges Top 260,000 ETH ‚Äì What This Means For Price For context, Bitcoin, according to the crypto expert, recorded a 122x increase from its market low to market high between 2015 and 2017. However, that was only 21.3% of Bitcoin‚Äôs price gain in the previous cycle (between 2011 and 2013). Source: X Brandt further noted that the same thing happened between 2018 and 2021. Despite a 22x increase from its market low to market high, Bitcoin only recorded 18% of the price increase it saw in the previous cycle. Having laid this premise, the crypto expert concluded that this market cycle shouldn‚Äôt be any different as Bitcoin will likely see about 20% of the price gain recorded in the previous cycle. Taking $15,473 as the market low for this cycle, he noted that 20% of the previous cycle‚Äôs gain would mean that the market high for this cycle was supposed to be $72,723, a price level that Bitcoin already hit on its way to a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,750. Meanwhile, the crypto expert acknowledged that Bitcoin historically records its most price gains after the Bitcoin halving, which just recently occurred. However, he added that the crypto community has to deal with the fact of the exponential decay, which has made him believe there is a 25% chance that Bitcoin has already topped this cycle.‚Äù Why The Exponential Decay Might Be Bullish For Bitcoin Brandt mentioned that Bitcoin would likely drop to the mid $30,000 or its 2021 lows if it has indeed topped. He, however, added that this decline could be the ‚Äúmost bullish thing that could happen from a long-term view.‚Äù Related Reading: Brace For Price Impact: Dogecoin Whales Move Massive 456 Million DOGE To Exchanges From a ‚Äúclassical charting point of view,‚Äù the crypto expert hinted that Bitcoin was still primed for major parabolic moves to the upside, even though it doesn‚Äôt happen now.

Brandt also alluded to Gold‚Äôs chart from August 2020 to March 2024 as an example of what Bitcoin‚Äôs price action could look like soon enough.

With the overwhelming majority of fund allocation still going to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the fund's total return has performed largely in line with BTC. Of the fund's ten holdings, most have generally positive network trends. However, there are a few that look less than promising at this point. Back in October 2023, I covered the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ( BITW ) for Seeking Alpha and compared it with the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ( GDLC ). My main takeaways from that article can be summarized as follows: BITW has a better methodology for designating fund inclusion than GDLC BITW has a lower weighting to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) than GDLC BITW historically trades at a larger discount to net asset value than GDLC In the time since publishing, BITW has taken shareholders on a 200% rocket ride higher. I'm not going to reiterate all of the same points made in my last article again. Rather, with this article I'd like to offer more updated assessments for each of the coin networks held in the fund. Data by YCharts Since my October article, only Solana ( SOL-USD ) has outperformed Bitcoin and even that underperformance has been proven to be relatively minimal compared to the daily volatility of SOL - which can often be 5 to 10% intraday. Given the relative underperformance from the alts, the fund itself has underperformed Bitcoin slightly despite the enormous weighting to the coin. In the following sections, fund weightings are according to Bitwise. Additionally, the market cap ranks and circulating supply metrics are from CoinMarketCap.com. Bitcoin Current weighting: 70.4% Crypto Marketcap Rank: 1 Circulating supply: 93.8% of max supply For Bitcoin, 2024 has had plenty of catalysts supportive of higher prices. In January the SEC's approval of spot ETFs has resulted in over 217k BTC coming into traditional financial products. More recently, the block reward halving that cut coin issuance down from 6.25 BTC to just 3.125 BTC per block was coupled with an explosion in fee revenue: Weekly Fees vs P/F Ratio (Token Terminal) During the week of the halving, Bitcoin generated over $140 million in fee revenue for miners - an all time high for the network. With that fee spike, Bitcoin's fully diluted price to fees ratio (market cap/fee revenue) fell to its lowest level since December. Fees do come at a user adoption cost: Monthly DAUs vs Transactions (Token Terminal) Bitcoin's monthly average DAU of 450k in April is down 26% from April 2023 and well below levels from as long ago as 2020. Ethereum Current weighting: 21.0% Crypto Marketcap Rank: 2 Circulating supply: 100%, non-fixed supply A recent fundamental catalyst for Ethereum that appears to be having a considerable impact on the network is the Dencun upgrade . Weekly Fees vs P/F Ratio (Token Terminal) Dencun made it less expensive for L2 scaling chains to publish to Ethereum's main layer. The byproduct of that has been less fees for Ethereum as L2s increasingly become more widely used than the main layer. As of 4/26/24, Ethereum's $202 million in fee revenue is down 16% from April 2023. This comes after March 2024 generated more than 3x the fees from March 2023. Monthly DAUs vs Transactions (Token Terminal) For Ethereum, there has been a noticeable uptick in DAUs since Dencun and March's 454k DAUs was a record for the network. Solana Current weighting: 3.6% Crypto Marketcap Rank: 5 Circulating supply: 100%, non-fixed supply Despite yet another network shutdown in February, Solana's price action reflects a blockchain network that has experienced an incredible resurgence over the last several months: Weekly Fees vs P/F Ratio (Token Terminal) In many ways, Solana was left for dead after the FTX fiasco. And yet, SOL is arguably one of the most interesting tokens in the entire market given the surging network fees and comparatively low 90x price to fee ratio. L1 Active Addresses (Artemis) In the chart above, the green bars represent monthly active addresses on Solana. In back to back months, Solana has averaged 1.2 million DAUs. This is more than both Bitcoin and Ethereum combined in each month. Ripple Current weighting: 1.6% Crypto Marketcap Rank: 7 Circulating supply: 55.1% of max supply Ripple ( XRP-USD ) is admittedly not one of the blockchain networks that I've been overly excited about in my time covering the industry. I covered the coin in March for Seeking Alpha. 30 Day Average Active Addresses (CoinMetrics) The network generates almost no fee revenue whatsoever compared with the networks already mentioned and 30 day Active Addresses has been under 40k for most of 2024. After briefly being competitive with Stellar ( XLM-USD ), Ripple usage has been in decline for two straight years. Cardano Current weighting: 0.9% Crypto Marketcap Rank: 10 Circulating supply: 79.2% of max supply 30 Day Average Active Addresses and Fees (CoinMetrics) Cardano's ( ADA-USD ) fundamental story is very similar to Ripple's from where I sit. 30 day Active Addresses have been in decline for two years straight and the network's fee generation is minimal. Avalanche Current weighting: 0.7% Crypto Marketcap Rank: 12 Circulating supply: 52.8% of max supply Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) has been another Solana-like bright spot in the crypto market over the last year or so based purely on coin price performance from lows. That performance has since subsided in 2024 as network activity surges in December have been more of a flash in the pan than sustained: Weekly fees vs P/F Ratio (Token Terminal) AVAX's price to fee ratio has trended up in recent months and monthly DAUs have been comparable to networks like Ripple and Cardano. Polkadot Current weighting: 0.5% Crypto Marketcap Rank: 14 Circulating supply: 100%, non-fixed supply Polkadot Monthly DAUs (Artemis) Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) has a relatively small userbase compared to the other chains listed above. At just 7.6k DAUs for the month of April and minimal fee generation, I'm very surprised DOT is still valued at nearly $10 billion. Chainlink Current weighting: 0.5% Crypto Marketcap Rank: 16 Circulating supply: 58.7% of max supply Chainlink Weekly Transactions (IntoTheBlock) Chainlink ( LINK-USD ) is another network that I've covered for Seeking Alpha in the past. Unlike the other networks listed, Chainlink functions more as a data oracle than as a standalone blockchain. This is what I said about it back in July: Chainlink can serve as an important protocol for proof of reserves. With the well-documented blowups of centralized crypto firms like FTX and Celsius, there is likely growing demand for easily verifiable off-chain data. Token transactions have been trending down since November. The coin has roughly tripled since my article and I suspect most of the gains here have been had for the time being. Polygon Current weighting: 0.4% Crypto Marketcap Rank: 18 Circulating supply: 99% of max supply Polygon Monthly DAUs (Artemis) Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) is a network that I've generally been bullish through the years. The performance of the coin has been disappointing to say the least. Polygon Labs launched a second blockchain in addition to it's original PoS chain last year. The new chain, a zkEVM network, has had stagnant user growth this year - you can barely even see the zkEVM trend in the chart above. By comparison, the PoS chain has averaged over 1 million daily active addresses for each of the last two months. Interestingly, usage migration from zkEVM to PoS is a good thing for the MATIC token as the zkEVM network doesn't require MATIC for gas while the PoS chain does. All this said, considering the level of user adoption on the chain, Polygon still generates a very small amount of fees compared to leading networks mentioned above. Uniswap Current weighting: 0.3% Crypto Marketcap Rank: 23 Circulating supply: 59.9% of max supply Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) is a really interesting coin due the protocol's commanding lead in the DEX ecosystem. In February, I highlighted a vote to turn on fee sharing with UNI tokenholders. That vote ultimately did not pass and we've seen the spike in token price following that news completely retrace. More concerning now, the US Securities and Exchange Commission recently served core Uniswap developer Uniswap Labs a Wells Notice. Weekly fees vs P/F ratio (Token Terminal) The protocol itself generated over $150 million in fees during the month of March and April is closing in on $100 million. Assuming it gets there, March and April 2024 would be the first back to back $100+ million fee months for Uniswap since January 2022. To token currently trades at about 5x fees. Risks Getting beyond the understanding that all of these assets are highly volatile and hold significant risk of price depreciation long term, the biggest risk facing investors is likely the regulatory environment in the United States. With the exception of Bitcoin which had a fair launch, no ICO, and is sufficiently decentralized by several metrics, most of the coins on this list are either already under regulatory scrutiny or could potentially come under scrutiny in the future. Through various enforcement actions, the SEC has deemed most of these tokens to be unregistered securities already. These blockchains are all global and are thus not at the mercy of any one country, agency, or bureaucrat. But there are clear signs that US regulators have become more aggressive against crypto protocols in April and I suspect this will continue through the election. To the degree to which any of the regulatory headwinds have been priced in to any of these coins would be pure speculation on my part. Investor Takeaways As far as the individual coins in the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund go, I'm of the view that this fund is fairly well allocated. Most of the tokens in BITW have favorable tokenomic models. However, not all of them have positive trends in network usage and I suspect the next 5-10 years will see substantial consolidation of users among these networks. There are some in this fund that I flat out don't expect to make it. That said, the alt allocations are still very small. For long term buyers who want exposure to a broad crypto fund, BITW may serve that purpose. However, there is the drawback that the fund doesn't stake the PoS assets like ETH, SOL, or ADA. But the tradeoff with the blockchain reward opportunity cost is the fact that BITW can be held in a tax-advantaged account like an IRA. If you're a long term believer in crypto, BITW at a 32.5% discount in a Roth isn't a bad way to express the idea.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | SOL,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4687031-bitw-bitwise-10-crypto-index-fund-etf-holdings-assessment?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/26462780.jpeg

However, despite the AI‚Äôs bullish outlook, financial experts urge investors to approach the prediction with a healthy dose of skepticism. Related Reading: Is SUI Sinking? TVL Tanks As Crypto Price Fails To Keep Afloat Bitcoin Price Stagnant, But AI Model Foresees Bright Future For the past week, Bitcoin has been stuck in a holding pattern, hovering stubbornly around the $64,000 mark. This lack of volatility has left many investors scratching their heads, unsure of the market‚Äôs next move. But a deep learning model developed by CryptoQuant, a leading blockchain analytics platform, has thrown a curveball into the mix. Source: CryptoQuant The model, trained on a massive dataset of historical price movements and on-chain activity, predicts a significant price surge for Bitcoin in the coming weeks. According to the analysis, Bitcoin could break past the $77,000 barrier within the next 30 days, marking a new all-time high (ATH). Bullish Metrics Support AI‚Äôs Vision While the AI‚Äôs prediction is certainly eye-catching, some analysts are taking a wait-and-see approach. They point to several bullish metrics that seem to align with the model‚Äôs forecast. The network-to-value (NVT) ratio, a metric used to gauge an asset‚Äôs relative valuation, has dipped significantly, suggesting Bitcoin might be undervalued. Source: Alternative.me Additionally, exchange reserves have been dropping, indicating a decrease in selling pressure. These factors, coupled with the model‚Äôs prediction, paint a potentially optimistic picture for Bitcoin‚Äôs immediate future. However, a lurking shadow of uncertainty remains. The Fear and Greed Index, a measure of investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, currently sits firmly in ‚Äúgreed‚Äù territory. Historically, periods of extreme greed have often been followed by market corrections. This raises concerns that the current price stagnation might not be a prelude to a surge, but rather a sign of an overheated market ripe for a pullback. Bitcoin is now trading at $62.850. Chart: TradingView Stalemate Before Potential Breakout? Technical analysis of Bitcoin‚Äôs daily chart reveals further complexities. The price has repeatedly failed to breach its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a key indicator of short-term momentum. Both the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) are hovering sideways, suggesting a lack of clear direction in the market. These indicators imply that investors might be in for a few more days of sluggish price movement before a potential breakout, either upwards or downwards, occurs. Related Reading: Analysts Call It: XRP Primed For A 700% Surge ‚Äì Details A Calculated Gamble The deep learning model‚Äôs prediction offers a glimmer of hope for Bitcoin bulls, but it‚Äôs crucial to remember that AI forecasts are not infallible.

26456964,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605404,1714224638,Bitcoin Drops Below 4-Hour MA ‚Äì Bearish Trend Ahead?,"Following a pullback, the price of Bitcoin has continued on its downward movement. The coin, after failing to break above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the trend line has experienced a drop of over 6% from its previous high. Will the price of BTC continue to move in a downward direction or will it reverse and start moving in an upward direction? As of the time of writing, the price of BTC was trading around $62,972 which is about 28% down from its all-time high and was down by 1.27% in the last 24 hours. Although the price is trading below the 100 SMA on the 4-hour chart, on the daily chart it is still trading above the 100 SMA. Current Condition Of Indicators And What They Suggest Looking at the chart, technically a support level and a resistance level of $59,653 and $67,255 were formed respectively. However, there could be more support and resistance levels created if the price continues to move downward. 4-Hour Moving Average: A technical observation of the chart from the 4-hour timeframe as seen in the image below reveals that the price is trending below the 100-day moving average. This suggests that the price is on a downtrend and could potentially move further downward. 4-Hour RSI indicator: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator here suggests a downward trend as the RSI signal has crossed and is trending below the 50% line as observed on the above chart. The MACD indicator from the 4-hour chart also suggests that the price might continue to move downward as the MACD histograms are trending below the zero line. Both the MACD line and the Signal line have crossed and are trending below the MACD zero line, indicating a bearish trend, as seen in the above image. Possible Outcome With the setup of the above indicators, it can be suggested that the price of Bitcoin is still bearish and that there are possibilities that it could still move further downward. If Bitcoin continues downward and breaks below the support level of $59,653, it could witness a deep correction to create a new support level. However, if the price fails to break below this support level, it could start an upward correctional movement towards its previous level of $67,255 and if it manages to break above this level, the price will begin an uptrend.

This crypto analyst suggests that the crypto could rise to as high as $100,000 when it makes that move. Related Reading: Is SUI Sinking? TVL Tanks As Crypto Price Fails To Keep Afloat Bitcoin‚Äôs Bull Flag Suggests More Upside Denis Baca, Head of Product at Zivoe Finance, noted that the bull flag formation on Bitcoin‚Äôs daily chart historically suggests that the crypto token is primed for more upsides. He added that the bullish pattern is ‚Äúshaping up nicely‚Äù and that Bitcoin could potentially shoot up towards $100,000 once the declining volume picks up. However, Baca further suggested that Bitcoin could drop below $60,000 before it makes such a parabolic move. He alluded to how the crypto token historically retests the support level of the 20-week SMA (small moving average) in May. This could cause Bitcoin to drop to $56,000, he claimed. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.2 trillion. Chart: TradingView Baca opined that such price dips could be ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù for Bitcoin before it experiences a reversal. He elaborated that these dips ‚Äúoffer solid buying opportunities,‚Äù which could help spark Bitcoin‚Äôs move to record highs. Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also shared his thoughts on what this bullish pattern could mean for Bitcoin. On his part, he suggested that the formation further proves the continuation of Bitcoin‚Äôs bull run and that a bearish reversal was unlikely. #Bitcoin on a daily chart forming a bull continuation pattern.

He noted that the flagship crypto token has managed to build resilient support at $64,000, but without any catalyst, it will merely continue to trade around the $67,000 range. It is worth noting that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which previously served as a major catalyst to Bitcoin‚Äôs price surges, have recently suffered from declining demand. They have also experienced significant net outflows this month, leading to a wave of Bitcoin sell-offs from the fund issuers to fulfill redemptions. Related Reading: Analysts Call It: XRP Primed For A 700% Surge ‚Äì Details Despite this, Stoychev is positive that Bitcoin won‚Äôt drop below $60,000. He predicts that the only thing that can cause Bitcoin to retrace to such a level is if high interest rates are maintained longer than expected, as this can affect sentiment toward crypto assets. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $62,900, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

26448328,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605362,1714208440,Bitcoin Sell Calls Going Through The Roof: But Is It Really Time To Sell?,"The story has not been any much different for Bitcoin, with its price still stuck in a consolidation range in the past week. The sluggishness of the premier cryptocurrency ‚Äì and the general market ‚Äì has continued despite the completion of the halving event over a week ago. The halving event, which saw mining rewards take a significant cut, was expected to usher in another round of bullishness for the Bitcoin price. On the contrary, investors appear to be getting frustrated with the slow activity of the market, with many calling for the dump of BTC. Bitcoin Sell Calls At Increased Rate: Blockchain Firm According to a recent report by on-chain analytics firm Santiment, investors are increasingly calling for the sale of Bitcoin across social media following its latest drop toward $63,000. The relevant metric here is the ‚Äúsocial volume‚Äù indicator, which tracks the number of unique posts and messages on different social platforms that mention a specific topic. Related Reading: Ethereum Withdrawals From Exchanges Top 260,000 ETH ‚Äì What This Means For Price Santiment aggregated data of ‚Äúbuy or bullish‚Äù, ‚Äúsell or bearish,‚Äù or related mentions for the premier cryptocurrency over the past week. The on-chain analytics then highlighted a shift in the trend, with the bearish calls looking to drown out the bullish noise on social media. Social volume for Bitcoin over the past week | Source: Santiment/X According to Santiment, Bitcoin‚Äôs recent fall to $63,000 resulted in the lowest level of buy and bullish calls since April 21st (just before BTC recovered back above $67,000). As shown in the chart above, the social volume for terms related to ‚Äúsell‚Äù shot up after the price decline. Typically, the increased bearish mentions of Bitcoin suggest a rising level of FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) amongst investors. However, when traders seemingly become frustrated and impatient, there is usually a higher probability of a market rebound. Almost 90% Of Circulating BTC In Profit ‚Äì Impact On Price According to recent on-chain data, about 90% of Bitcoin in supply is in profit. On the surface, this basically implies that the most current holders of the premier cryptocurrency bought at a lower price compared to the current price.

BTC initially gained nearly 10% to trade as high as $67,020 on April 24. However, in the last two days, the digital asset‚Äôs price has declined by 6.49%, falling below the $63,000 price mark. As expected, such negative performance has drawn attention from investors and market speculators. In particular, renowned analyst with X handle Rekt Capital has provided a theory on Bitcoin‚Äôs price fall and perhaps an insight into the future price movements of the crypto market leader. Related Reading: Timing The Breakout: When Will Bitcoin Escape The Post-Halving Consolidation? BTC Potential Price Decline Ahead? In an X post on April 26, Rekt Capital stated that Bitcoin has now entered the Post-Halving ‚ÄúDanger Zone.‚Äù The analyst described this phenomenon as a period during which Bitcoin has historically experienced price corrections after the halving event. Rekt Capital noted that in 2016, Bitcoin recorded these price retraces in the three weeks following the Halving event. During this time, the token‚Äôs price declined by 11%. The analyst postulates that Bitcoin is now in the Post-Halving ‚ÄúDanger Zone‚Äù of the current bull cycle following its price fall over the last two days. It is worth stating that if Bitcoin mirrors past price movement in this phase, the token could be heading for $60,000. However, Rekt Capital states that if the crypto market leader experiences such a fate, it will be within the next two weeks. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades around $62,672 with a decline of 2.44% in the last day. This price fall underscores BTC‚Äôs negative performance in the last month in which it has lost 11.16% of its market value.

42408340,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIHxe,1714189498,DOJ Disputes Roman Storm's Characterization of Tornado Cash Operations in New Filing,"The U.S. Department of Justice pushed back against Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm's motion to dismiss a criminal indictment against him.  Tornado Cash was a money transmitting business, and the DOJ said it expects its evidence to support the charges, a Friday filing said.  The U.S. Department of Justice rebuffed Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm's motion to dismiss criminal charges on Friday, saying the defense filing presented disputed facts that a jury should weigh in on, rather than arguments that fit an early-stage motion.  The DOJ charged Storm, alongside fellow developer Roman Semenov, with conspiring to commit money laundering, conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitter and conspiring to violate sanctions law by creating and operating Tornado Cash, a crypto mixing service designed to anonymize transactions. North Korea's Lazarus Group and other criminal entities have laundered funds through Tornado Cash, U.S. authorities have alleged.  Storm's attorneys moved to dismiss the indictment at the end of March, arguing that Tornado Cash is not a custodial mixing service ‚Äì and doesn't fit the definition of a ""financial institution"" ‚Äì and that Storm was not able to control the service or block Lazarus and similar groups from using it.  Merely developing code for the project isn't the same as operating a money laundering entity, the defense argued.  In Friday's filing, the DOJ disputed how the defense characterized Tornado Cash, saying it was announced in 2019 as a mixer and the overall service includes a website, user interface, a combination of smart contracts and a ""network of 'relayers.'""  ""The defendant cannot obtain dismissal of the Indictment by simply making factual assertions about his own contested view as to how the Tornado Cash service operated and based on his own self-serving version of his intent or lack thereof when taking certain acts,"" Friday's filing said.  The DOJ also disputed Storm's assertions about how the Tornado Cash interface worked and how much control individual users might have over the deposit and withdrawal process, providing screenshots. The filing also argues that Storm and his co-founders maintained control over the mixer, at least during the time period the DOJ is referring to in its charging document (2019 to August 2022).  The filing makes repeated references to evidence the DOJ expects to introduce during trial, addressing how Storm and other Tornado Cash founders built and developed the system, how people used Tornado Cash and other details.  Storm is set to go on trial this September, while Semenov remains at large.

XRP And Ethereum Classic In The Spotlight Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP, was highlighted as a prominent crypto zombie. Despite XRP‚Äôs active trading volume of around $2 billion daily, Forbes asserts that the token‚Äôs primary purpose remains ‚Äúspeculative‚Äù and ‚Äúlacking meaningful utility.‚Äù Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Active: Here‚Äôs Where They Are Sending Coins However, Ripple Labs and XRP are not alone in this regard. Forbes reveals that 50 blockchains, excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), currently trade at values surpassing $1 billion, with at least 20 of them classified as ‚Äúfunctional zombies.‚Äù Collectively, these 20 blockchains hold a market value of $116 billion, despite having ‚Äúlimited user bases.‚Äù According to Forbes, an example of a ‚Äúfunctional zombie‚Äù is Ethereum Classic, which maintains the distinction of being the original Ethereum chain. While ETC has a market value of $4.6 billion, its fee generation in 2023 was less than $41,000, raising questions about the blockchain‚Äôs viability for the news organization. Another crypto project in Forbes‚Äô report is Tezos, which raised $230 million through an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017. Tezos‚Äô XTZ token currently holds a market capitalization of $1.2 billion. However, the blockchain‚Äôs fee earnings were meager, with $5,640 in February 2024 and a total of $177,653 for all of 2023. Algorand, once hailed as an ‚ÄúEthereum killer‚Äù due to its capability of processing 7,500 transactions per second, faces similar challenges. Despite a market cap of $2 billion and a treasury holding of $500 million, Algorand earned $63,000 in blockchain transaction fees throughout 2023. For Forbes, this casts doubt on its actual adoption and utility. Crypto ‚ÄòZombie‚Äô Blockchains The zombie blockchains are categorized into two groups by Forbes: spin-offs and direct competitors to established blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Spin-off zombies include Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XMR), Bitcoin SV (BSV), and Ethereum Classic. These blockchains, collectively valued at $23 billion, reportedly emerged from ‚Äúdisagreements‚Äù among programmers regarding the governance and direction of the original chains. Forbes notes that when such conflicts arise, hard forks occur, resulting in new networks that share the same transaction history as their predecessors. The agency claims that their market value ‚Äúoften exceeds‚Äù their real-world usage.

26431910,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605315,1714179627,Expert Makes Bold Call: It‚Äôs Time To Swap Your Dollars For Bitcoin,"Billionaire investor Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, recently discussed the viability of financial assets. He took to X, a social media platform previously known as Twitter and owned by Elon Musk, to highlight the decreasing purchasing power of the United States dollar in comparison to the potential of Bitcoin (BTC). US Dollar Vs. Bitcoin Value Performance In the post on X, the SkyBridge Capital founder pointed out that a dollar from 2020 is now only worth about 75 cents, underscoring a significant devaluation due to inflation.

Dollar from 2020 is now worth 75 cents. Buy Bitcoin credit @balajis pic.twitter.com/WzIosKfJv2 ‚Äî Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) April 26, 2024 Scaramucci‚Äôs critique comes at a time when the global economy grapples with heightened inflation rates, which have eroded the real value of fiat money. He specifically cited a ‚Äú25.14% compounded inflation rate‚Äù as a critical indicator of why the dollar is losing ground. In contrast, Bitcoin has not only maintained a strong profile but has also appreciated in value, further cementing its position as a viable hedge against inflation and a potential safe haven for investors. So far, Bitcoin‚Äôs market performance has been quite appealing. Particularly, despite the significant downturn experienced in the past few years, the asset has managed to come out of the bloodbath and recently soared to an all-time high above $73,000 in March. This peak performance labels Bitcoin as not just a digital asset but a major player in the global financial landscape. However, despite Scaramucci‚Äôs bullish outlook, it‚Äôs worth noting that Bitcoin has seen its share of volatility. It has been struggling to maintain its appeal recently, with a modest 0.9% increase in the last 24 hours ‚Äì a slight recovery from a 2% drop over the past week. BTC Shifting Market Sentiments Further insights into the market‚Äôs behavior towards Bitcoin reveal changing dynamics. Data from CryptoQuant highlighted a negative turn in the Bitcoin funding rate for the first time since October 2023, indicating a cooling interest in speculative trading on the asset. This shift suggests that while the long-term outlook might still be strong, short-term investor sentiment has become cautious, possibly awaiting clearer signals before making further commitments. The current market sentiment is also reflected in the technical analysis of a prominent crypto analyst, Ali. In Ali‚Äôs recent post on X, a notable mention was made of a ‚Äúdeath cross‚Äù seen in Bitcoin‚Äôs 12-hour chart, where the short-term moving average dips below a long-term counterpart, traditionally a bearish signal. Additionally, the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential indicator points to potential price reversals after a consistent trend, adding another layer of complexity to Bitcoin‚Äôs trading strategy.

26429987,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605333,1714176046,Timing The Breakout: When Will Bitcoin Escape The Post-Halving Consolidation?,"Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency in the market, has been trading within a re-accumulation range between the $59,000 and $70,000 price levels for the past month and a half. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital recently shared its perspective on this phase and its potential duration, drawing from historical patterns and data in a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Related Reading: Is SUI Sinking? TVL Tanks As Crypto Price Fails To Keep Afloat Breakout Timing And Historical Patterns According to Rekt‚Äôs analysis, Bitcoin tends to experience a re-accumulation range following the Halving event, which occurs every four years to counteract any inflationary effect on Bitcoin by lowering the reward amount for miners and maintaining scarcity. Historically, This consolidation phase lasts up to 150 days before Bitcoin breaks into a parabolic uptrend. Based on this pattern, if Bitcoin continues to consolidate for the next 150 days, Rekt suggests a breakout would be expected in September 2024. The ideal duration of a re-accumulation range is crucial in determining Bitcoin‚Äôs future trajectory. Rekt Capital noted that when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,700 in mid-March, it accelerated its cycle by 260 days. However, with over 49 days of consolidation, the acceleration has reduced to approximately 210 days. Resetting The Bitcoin Halving Cycle Repeating historical trends, where Bitcoin consolidates for 150 days after the Halving, would still indicate an acceleration in the current cycle, albeit by a lesser extent of 60 days. Nevertheless, Rekt contends that Bitcoin would ideally need to consolidate for at least 210 days to fully resynchronize with its historical Halving cycles and reset the current acceleration in this cycle to 0. This would bring the rate of acceleration to 0 days and potentially lead to a breakout around November 2024. Related Reading: Analysts Call It: XRP Primed For A 700% Surge ‚Äì Details The analyst further suggested that to achieve a 200+ day post-Halving consolidation and fully resynchronize with historical Halving cycles, Bitcoin would need to replicate its mid-2023 re-accumulation range, which lasted 224 days before a new uptrend emerged. Rekt concluded: Overall, how long this current Re-Accumulation Range will last will dictate the remaining acceleration in this cycle and ultimately influence where Bitcoin will finally peak in its Bull Market. The largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of $1.2 billion, is currently trading at $64,400, showing minimal fluctuations compared to Thursday‚Äôs price movements. Recently, Bitcoin has encountered resistance at the $66,000 level, hindering its ability to consolidate above this threshold. Conversely, the $63,400 level may serve as a support base for the cryptocurrency in the event of heightened downward volatility over the weekend.
