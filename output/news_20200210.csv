42383269,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uyqj,1581375620,"SEC 'Safe Harbor' Proposal Lauded by Token Fans, DeFi Builders at 0x Conference","The token industry is applauding SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s “Safe Harbor” proposal, calling it a mature response to the 2017 ICO bubble.      Announced the day before decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol 0x’s 0xpo conference last Friday in San Francisco, founders, lawyers and tokenization fanatics of all stripes said the proposal could be a boon for both entrepreneurs and investors in the nascent tokenization industry.      And what better a place to ponder the news: an event dedicated to the permissionless exchange of digital assets with a deep roster of ethereum veterans in attendance. Add to that, news of the DeFi sector breaching $1 billion in locked-in crypto and the energy at 0xpo rivaled tip-off at March Madness.      “It shows a remarkable level of personal care,” Richard Burton, an independent DeFi developer, told CoinDesk. “[Peirce] has clearly really thought through the opportunities and challenges of people building these systems in America. … Ultimately she doesn't want to see innovation leave America's shores.”      The SEC proposal has two major points: a three-year grace period for token projects to sufficiently decentralize according to SEC standards plus a documentation process involving both team and code disclosures.      Peirce said the three-year window would provide enough time for projects to decentralize their tokens so as not to fall under the securities definitions enshrined in the regulator’s infamous Howey Test. In March 2019, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton seconded SEC Director William Hinman’s opinion that ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, had decentralized enough to no longer be considered a security.      Robert Leshner, CEO of DeFi protocol Compound, said the Peirce proposal could lead to novel financial assets coming onto the blockchain. For Compound, that opens up more loans based on previously difficult-to-trade assets such as real estate.      “It creates an avenue to safely create financial assets,” Leshner said of the proposal. “I think there might be more other types of collateral assets available not just to Compound but to DeFi in general over time.”      0x data scientist Alex Kroeger told CoinDesk the 0x team was excited to see the proposal move forward.      As a past developer for Stripe and the founder of now-defunct wallet startup Balance, Burton called the three-year safe harbor period just about right for projects, noting bitcoin, ethereum and DeFi protocol Maker took about three years to get out the door. Good projects should be met with healthy regulation, Burton added.      “If you're in North Korea explaining how to use DAI or you get a celebrity to help you sell a shitcoin, you deserve to meet the tough arm of the law,” Burton said. “If you're trying to build new financial services with sensible valuations and using experienced investors – that should be what America should encourage.”      The Peirce proposal comes after massive investor losses following the 2017 ICO boom and subsequent bust. Dozens upon dozens of coins remain 90 percent or more underwater from all-time highs. Bitcoin remains nearly 50 percent down from $20,000 peak in December 2017 and ethereum down some 84 percent, according to data provider Messari, despite its recent run-up to $220.      Kevin Owocki, who operates an open-source funding project for ethereum, Gitcoin, called the proposal a “positive step.” Although Gitcoin does not have a token and never ran an ICO, Owocki told CoinDesk the proposal keeps the “U.S. a competitive place for technological innovation.”      Compound’s Leshner came to a similar conclusion, telling CoinDesk that stronger teams and products will ship because of the clear regulatory stance.      “We are going to see some sense of comeback of higher quality teams into the market willing to create financial assets knowing that there’s a path for them to do so safely,” he said, “This will probably take at least a year to play out before we start to see the comeback of the token.”      Even still, the proposal is just that: a proposal.      As a commissioner, Peirce’s stance is notable and valuable for the industry but has a long road before becoming law, said Daniel A. Nathan, a partner at San Francisco-based securities law firm Orrick. Orrick has successfully defended 100 securities class actions in the U.S., according to documents from the firm.      “She’s out there by herself,” Nathan said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | ZRX,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/10/sec-safe-harbor-proposal-lauded-by-token-fans-defi-builders-at-0x-conference,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/094b782e25df12ed02a1277f67f4e47d452e6ff1-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383258,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uyct,1581370249,Trump's 2021 Budget Proposal Seeks to Optimize Crypto Policing,"U.S. President Donald Trump’s $4.8 trillion budgethttps://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/budget_fy21.pdf proposal for FY 2021, released Monday, seeks to expand the Treasury Department’s cryptocurrency oversight by returning the United States Secret Service, now a division of the Department of Homeland Security, to its jurisdiction.    The reshuffling would “create new efficiencies” in the Secret Service’s investigation of criminal acts involving cryptocurrencies and the financial marketplace, the executive report reads. It will also give Treasury more fire power to, as the budget reads, “disrupt terrorist financing, hold rogue states and human rights abusers accountable, and detect and deter financial crimes.”      The Secret Service is better known for protecting U.S. presidents and their families, but it is also responsible for investigating a wide range of financial crimes including fraud and counterfeiting, among others.      “Technological advancements in recent decades, such as cryptocurrencies and the increasing interconnectedness of the international financial marketplace, have resulted in more complex criminal organizations and revealed stronger links between financial and electronic crimes and the financing of terrorists and rogue state actors,” according to the document.      That may be why the people behind the budget think the Secret Service, the sole office charged with the protection of U.S. currency, could give a major boost to Treasury’s cyber crime-fighting efforts.      At Treasury, the Secret Service’s cryptocurrency investigations could dovetail with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a money-laundering watchdog that monitors cryptocurrency-related violations of the Banking Secrecy Act.      DHS, the Secret Service and branches within the Treasury Department have already spent millions of dollars on blockchain analytics, tapping Chainalysis to provide software tools and services.      Trump's budget is a long way from becoming law, though. Presidential budget proposals have little to no legal bearing on the budget process, which the Constitution stipulates must begin in the U.S. House of Representatives.

42383266,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uyoD,1581357603,Inside Chainalysis’ Multimillion-Dollar Relationship With the US Government,"It started with a $9,000 data software contract for the FBI in 2015.      But just five years later, Chainalysis is now the cryptocurrency-tracing equivalent of Palantir, the data analytics company flush with lucrative government software contracts. Chainalysis is, right now, doing millions of dollars worth of business each year with the U.S. government, dwarfing its competitors in the young industry of blockchain surveillance.      The company is by far Uncle Sam’s leading crypto analysis contractor by spending and has become the go-to firm for 10 federal agencies, departments and bureaus.      In short, the feds want to catch up on, and make sense of, the tangled transactional web of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to stop all sorts of crimes – and they’ll spend big to do it.      Federal agencies have spent at least $10 million ($10,690,706 to be precise) in American tax dollars on Chainalysis’ tools, services and training since 2015, when Chainalysis was founded, according to 82 records of federal procurement contracts reviewed by CoinDesk. Counting contracts with possible extensions, the company stands to take in more than $14 million.      No competing firm’s federal contracts match Chainalysis', and none are as prevalent across agencies. CipherTrace, led by CEO David Jevans, has made about $6 million through mostly research and development contracts; Elliptic, a British firm, has had only one contract worth $2,450 with the Internal Revenue Service, according to federal data.      Chainalysis’ contracts open a small but prescient window into the federal government’s nascent relationship with the cryptocurrencies some use to evade detection. Bitcoin is a pseudonymous system with inherent traceability – a network moving billions of dollars in value on a public ledger that anyone can track.      And though Chainalysis data show only 1.1 percent of bitcoin transactions were illicit in 2019, that proportion is growing: up 180 percent over the year before.      The U.S. government has responded in kind, raising its spending on Chainalysis every year, the data show. It paid the company over $5 million in 2019, a 20 percent increase from 2018 and a 22,558 percent increase from 2015, when the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service were Chainalysis’ only federal clients.      Nowadays, Chainalysis’ federal money comes from many corners: the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), from financial regulators in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), from the IRS, the Secret Service (USSS), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) – even from the Department of the Air Force.      Most have signed six-figure deals with Chainalysis, although some agencies spend more than others. For instance, the TSA spent $40,000 on one contract in 2018 while the IRS, Chainalysis’s biggest federal partner spent $4.1 million over five years – $3.6 million of it since 2018, according to the data.      ICE, with $2.6 million in total contracts, holds the number two spot, and the FBI’s $2.4 million is third.      But the FBI plans to spend millions more in the next two years, and will overtake the IRS as the U.S. government's most prolific Chainalysis partner. On Dec. 18, 2019, it paid Chainalysis $377,500 for ""Virtual Currency Tracing Tools,"" with an option to spend at least $3,628,775 through 2022.      By contrast, when Vice reported on Chainalysis’s government contracts in 2017, the fledgling New York firm had received $330,000 from the FBI, $88,000 from the IRS and $58,000 from ICE in its history.    What are they buying?    It’s tricky to state with certainty what the agencies are buying from Chainalysis. Many of the contracts are short on details, with 29 mentioning various product licenses, five noting “Reactor” software and others a cryptic mix of telling and vague. (The Department of the Air Force has spent over $110,000 on “BitCoin [sic] Cryptocurrency Transactions”).      But the company that raised $30 million in Series B funding a year ago makes only three products: Reactor, KYT and Kryptos. Only Reactor, its flagship transaction visualization software, has been around for more than a year.      “While our private-sector customers also use Reactor, we have also developed two newer products – KYT (Know Your Transaction) and Kryptos – specifically for them,” said Jonathan Levin, co-founder and chief strategy officer at Chainalysis.      Reactor is Chainalysis’ investigatory workhorse. It visualizes cryptocurrency movement across a blockchain and flags addresses associated with illicit activity.      Casey Bohn, a high-tech crime specialist with the Virginia-based National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C), who regularly trains law enforcement officers to use Reactor and other firms’ cryptocurrency tools, said Reactor takes some of the pain out of blockchain crawling.      “It’s a relatively easy tool to use. It's not a rocket surgeon level of complexity,” Bohn said. “Once you figure the tool out you can really make some good headway in what is truly a tedious task.”      Bohn has taught federal, state and local officers, including some in the 10 agencies that contract with Chainalysis. He explained that blockchain analysis has broad appeal for them.      “All of these investigative agencies kind of have a specialized sub-niche” that intersects with cryptocurrency, he said.      One such niche is the IRS Cyber Crimes Unit (CCU), a five-year-old division of its larger Criminal Investigation (CI) wing and the force behind the tax collector’s cryptocurrency crimes investigations. It’s also a major Chainalysis client: CCU has spent over $3.3 million on four years of “Case Support and Training” from the firm.      The IRS did not respond to requests for comment. But in the 2019 Criminal Investigations annual report, IRS-CI Deputy Chief Jim Lee hinted his agents’ crypto-tracing prowess is “in demand” even outside of the agency.      “U.S. Attorneys want IRS-CI agents in all of their financial crime cases. The fact of the matter is, if a case involves money and it’s a crime that rises to the federal level, IRS-CI almost always has jurisdiction. There is no better example to this than in tracing cryptocurrency transactions,” he said.      IRS-CI Chief Don Fort has been even more explicit about his investigators’ relationship. He has said that Chainalysis helped the IRS and the Department of Justice dismantle a sprawling child pornography ring in South Korea.      But other agencies don’t talk about their cryptocurrency tracing activities. Most did not respond to requests for comment. FinCEN, the FBI and DEA declined to comment.      “DEA does not discuss any investigative techniques,” a spokesperson said.      Agencies may also not want to publicize their private-sector relationships, other now-public documents show.      In 2018, Vice filed a FOIA request with ICE demanding the agency produce documents related to its $13,188 contract for Chainalysis “software.” Five months later, ICE released an at-times poorly redacted document that confirmed its Homeland Security Investigations unit uses Reactor.      “Public disclosure of Chainalysis, Inc.'s cooperation with ICE would also damage ongoing cooperative information sharing arrangements with other companies in the logistics and financial sector,” according to that document.    Starting small    Chainalysis tailored its earliest product to cryptocurrency investigators. Levin, the co-founder, said his company initially focused on signing specialized agency teams.      “We started off with smaller units within agencies who were focused on being able to deal with cybercrime and money laundering,” Levin said. “What we found is that the different types of crime and illicit activity that these agencies need to be able to prevent means that our appeal has become much broader to those organizations, and our role has expanded.”      The strategy triggered a snowball effect of federal procurement contracts that may well stretch beyond the figures disclosed here. Levin said some contacts do not get reported in the FPDS system.      “Our revenue is roughly a 50-50 split between public and private sectors,” Levin said. The public split includes contracts with state-level agencies and governments overseas.      In many respects $10.6 million is a negligible total, according to Bohn, the cyber crimes educator. He pointed out the U.S. government spends many times more on other private-sector tech solutions, like Cellebrite, which helps investigators crack mobile phone data. Cellebrite has made at least $40,000,000 from government contracts since August 2015, FPDS records show.

42383263,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uyhv,1581355848,IBM Blockchain VP: Every Dollar Spent on Blockchain Yields $15 on Cloud,"Enterprise blockchain is a catalyst for further spending at Big Blue, according to Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s vice president of blockchain technologies.      ""It is driving additional spend,” Cuomo said. “When you look at the direct attribution of the actual dollars spent on blockchain, we are seeing that for every dollar spent, $15 is spent on other cloud services.”      The back-of-the-envelope math offers a revealing glimpse into the storied tech company’s current thinking on blockchain. Cuomo’s revenue figure comes as IBM works to bring enterprise blockchain closer into the company’s sprawling cloud offering. Some commentators have described the move as a reprioritization or even consolidation following the dissipating hype surrounding distributed ledger technology (DLT).      “Blockchain is a new class of enterprise application,” Cuomo told CoinDesk. “It plays into trends like app modernization and new cloud-native applications, data and analytics. It crosses all those things.” As such, the blockchain part of a blockchain application only accounts for about 20 percent of the overall solution, said Cuomo. That leaves 80 percent in other tech for bringing the network to life.      The bigger picture concerns tectonic shifts in Big Blue’s overall business strategy. Last year’s $34 billion acquisition of open source software giant Red Hat seems to be paying off. In its Q4 2019 results, IBM posted what analysts called surprising revenue growth: cloud and cognitive software revenue were up 9 percent, while Red Hat posted 24 percent revenue growth.      In addition, IBM chief Ginny Rometty is stepping down to make way for a new CEO, Arvind Krishna, the head of the cloud and cognitive business and architect of the Red Hat deal. Krishna takes over officially on April 6.      Regarding IBM’s changing priorities, Cuomo said IBM has “put its chips down on the table in a very aggressive way around the hybrid space.”      Hybrid cloud, a market worth some $1.2 trillion, according to McKinsey & Company, comprises a mix of on-premise, private-cloud and public-cloud services, where workloads can be handled across these different platforms.    Happily married    Drilling into potential synergies between blockchain and cloud, Cuomo pointed to “a wedding ceremony” arranged by IBM between Hyperledger Fabric – the Linux-based greenhouse for incubating enterprise blockchain projects – and Kubernetes – a platform for automating and scaling clusters of services across hybrid cloud systems. Kubernetes is a technology Red Hat has lots of expertise in, as exemplified by its OpenShift platform.      “Hyperledger Fabric works well with Kubernetes,” Cuomo said. “Many of the things we've done around Chaincode, which is the way we plug smart contracts into Fabric, is to make sure it runs really well on that type of containerized environment with buttoned-down security. Red Hat gave us that motivation.”      Ask Cuomo if the “trough of disillusionment” has meant enterprise adoption of blockchain tech has slowed down, and he’s defiant.      “That's 180 degrees from my observation. If anything, maybe the number of inbound projects has stabilized. But the thing I’ve noticed is the quality of the projects and sponsors of the projects really being thoughtful about what they are doing,” Cuomo said.      Describing 2018 as “more of a Wild West,” he added:    “We had a lot of projects. Some would hit, others missed. The ideas weren't always completely baked. Going into 2020, clients continue to get smarter.”    The fact remains, there have been some noticeable contractions in the enterprise blockchain world of late. Might there yet be some bloodletting on the blockchain side at IBM?      Cuomo says no: “We are very healthy here in blockchain land.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/10/ibm-blockchain-vp-every-dollar-spent-on-blockchain-yields-15-on-cloud,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c819d392b19c50e23f215f5413673c04aa9c976d-2560x1671.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That is, however, once it has received a banking license in the nation.      DAG has already had one go at winning the license. While its 2018 application wasn't successful, it has since had “constructive dialogue” with British financial watchdogs, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, according to a Monday report from the Financial Times.      It now plans to resubmit the application next month with a view to offering bank accounts to crypto firms from next year.      The U.K. banking sector has been notoriously averse to serving firms in the industry such as cryptocurrency exchanges. In the earlier days of crypto, U.K.-based exchange clients were forced to use SEPA banking transfers via European banks to fund their accounts. And though that situation has eased slightly , even prominent and established firms like Coinbase have still had problems, with Barclays pulling support last year.      Businesses in the U.K. industry are ""fed up with what they’re faced with to meet basic business banking needs at the moment,"" DAG Chief Commercial Officer Stephanie Ramezan told the FT.      As such, DAG hopes to improve the situation and join the very small number of financial institutions, such as Clearbank and its partner BCB Group, officially licensed – and willing – to serve the local crypto space.      “It’s a lack of understanding and reputation risk that has kept others away.

Vo1t's data centers can be installed on the premises or accessed remotely from a client’s computer, and IBM’s enclave keeps client’s key exchange data encrypted, regardless of whether it's in transit or in memory.      “Having this means our clients get to sign with their key in a separate transaction with IBM,” said Sebastian Higgs, general manager at Vo1t.      The London-based firm, whose name is supposed to remind customers of a bank vault, provides custody, lending, staking and trading products for 35 digital assets. Since 2017, Vo1t has been offering cold storage to firms listed on the Financial Times Stock Exchange, Trust companies and other financial institutions around the world. It advertises a 45-minute withdrawal time for assets held in cold storage.      While custody was once only the purview of wallet providers and crypto exchanges, banks and other large firms are pursuing the institutional investors who are becoming increasingly interested investing in cryptocurrency.      “We’ve been looking at the digital custody space and how we could make our servers and our cloud platform be a killer value proposition for this specific market,” said Rohit Badlaney, director of IBM Z as-a-Service.

42383259,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uye9,1581343200,Seed CX  Expands European Presence With Euro-Crypto Order Books,"Seed CX is expanding its European services with the addition of eight order books for its spot-trading market.      Seed Commodities Market, the Chicago-based firm’s spot market, announced Monday it has created euro trading pairs against bitcoin, ether, litecoin, bitcoin cash, Paxos dollar, TrueUSD, USDC and the U.S. dollar. It's also expanding trading hours to 24/7.      The new order books were launched in response to demand from Seed’s European traders, said Brian Liston, president of the spot market division.      “We have a lot of traders who are in Europe and Asia and we wanted to cater to those clients and make it extremely relevant,” he told CoinDesk. “People who are predominantly focused on euro books like our liquidity, our prices, our infrastructure but they just want to trade these order books.”      The company will now focus on building volume for the new books, which have already been live for a week. Further down the line, Liston envisions adding yen-denominated pairs – including an order book for YEN/USD.      “That creates an interesting strategy because not many places offer FX [foreign exchange] in more than one denominated book,” he said.    Focus on spot trading    While Seed CX’s spot trading business is expanding, its previous plans to launch its own derivatives products may be on hold.      According to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission’s list of Swap Execution Facilities, Seed CX’s SEF registration went dormant in September 2019. An SEF registration allows companies in the U.S. to trade derivatives products.      A CFTC fact sheet said SEFs are considered dormant if they have traded any derivatives in the past 12 months, and have been in operation for at least three years. Seed CX received its SEF in August 2016. It can reinstate the registration by filing documents with the CFTC.      Seed decided to focus on its spot trading and settlement due to the large number of derivatives exchanges currently in the market, according to Liston.      Seed Digital Commodities settles through Zero Hash, Seed CX’s subsidiary focused on custody and settlement. Zero Hash can support most currencies used in G20 nations, and would be able to add new order books quickly if there is sufficient demand, he said.      “We still have a good relationship with the CFTC and are keeping our options open,” Liston said. “However, we’re focusing almost all of our effort on the digital commodities market.”      The firm’s new 24/7 operations also come in response to existing demand, he said.      “What we’ve just done is launch trading over the weekend and a lot of crypto is 24/7 but our exchange was five days a week,” he said. “A lot of it was settlement [and] working with banks.""",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/10/seed-cx-expands-european-presence-with-euro-crypto-order-books,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4799b3b33f882114b32801f0e1d9636aeb64948a-1500x1004.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a document published on Friday, the government branch responsible for the digitization of Ukraine's economy listed the main principles of the country's approach to the crypto assets.      The main goals for the government in the field should be ""formation and implementation of state policy in the field of digitization, digital economy, digital innovation, e-governance and e-democracy, development of information society; assuring the development of virtual assets, blockchain and tokenization, artificial intelligence,"" the document reads.      Most notably, the ministry said it has no plans to bring in rules to regulate crypto mining as that industry is already self-governed by blockchain consensus rules.      ""We remain loyal to mining activities that form part of open decentralized networks. Mining does not require regulatory activity from governmental oversight bodies or other third-party regulations, this activity is regulated by the protocol itself and network members,"" the manifesto states.      The ministry will also ""contribute to the development and market introduction"" of distributed ledgers, support ""any innovation using these digital technologies, even if they are partially unregulated and/or not defined by national law"" and create regulatory sandboxes for the blockchain industry.

A small part of the funds are safe on cold wallets.""      An update on the company's website now indicates that ""fortunately a good part of the coins were kept on cold storage"" and that it will issue partial refunds, not having the wherewithal to fully compensate users.

The bitcoin and ether stolen were valued at around $72.5 million at press time.      Customers of the exchange will need to get their applications in quickly, with exchange saying: ""Refunds will begin on February 10, 2020, and end on May 8, 2020; after this date it will no longer be possible to request a refund as the Altsbit platform will be terminated.""

42431531,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN37Ph,1581332424,Bitcoin Takes a Dive After the Longest Daily Winning Run Since September,"View  Bitcoin's ongoing pullback could be extended further to the former resistance-turned-support of $9,586. Acceptance below that would expose the next base at $9,188.  A UTC close below $9,075 (Feb. 4 low) would invalidate higher lows on the daily chart and confirm a short-term bearish reversal.  The case for deeper pullback would weaken if prices rise above $10,010, violating the bearish setup on the hourly chart.    Bitcoin is feeling the pull of gravity at press time, despite having confirmed its longest daily winning streak since September on Sunday.      The top cryptocurrency by market value dropped from $10,197 to $9,732 during the Asian trading hours and is currently trading at $9,850, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      The sharp pullback has blanketed Sunday's ascent from $9,900 to $10,180 and is suggesting bullish exhaustion.      Bitcoin closed out (UTC) Sunday with a 2.75 percent gain, having risen by 5, 1.4, 0.5 and 1 percent on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, respectively.      That is the longest daily winning streak in five months, as seen below.      Bitcoin produced five straight green candles (days with net gains) from Aug. 30 to Sept. 3, marking a convincing move higher from $9,350 to $10,783. The rally, however, ended up recharging bears' engines for a deeper slide.      The latest winning streak is preceded by a sharp rise from lows near $6,850 observed in early January. Such solid rallies are often followed by corrections.      Bitcoin could soon test dip demand by revisiting deeper support levels.    Daily chart    Bitcoin ended Sunday with a green ""marubozu"" candle, which comprises a strong body and small or no wicks. It indicates buyers were in control from the open to the close, and is reflective of strong bullish sentiment.      So far, however, the followthrough has been negative. In fact, today's red candle has already engulfed Sunday's bullish marubozu.      A failed bullish marubozu at multi-month highs, or after notable price rallies, often precedes a deeper pullback.      So, a slide to the former resistance-turned-support at $9,586 (Nov. 4 high) cannot be ruled out. A violation there would expose the Jan. 19 high of $9,188 and the Feb. 4 low of $9,075. The short-term outlook would turn bearish if prices find acceptance below $9,075, invalidating the higher-lows setup.      If the support at $9,586 holds ground, the bulls will likely once more target the Oct. 26 high of $10,350.    Hourly chart    Bitcoin has lost its upward trajectory, as indicated by the downside break of the ascending trendline.      The ongoing drop looks to have legs as it is backed by an uptick in selling volume, as represented by red bars.      The case for a deeper pullback to $9,586 would be invalidated if prices rise above $10,010 with strong volumes, invalidating the lower-highs setup on the hourly chart.

42431521,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN373h,1581328800,Why Cypherpunk Witches Love Bitcoin,"We live in an age where young women use everything from emojis to bitcoin to practice witchcraft.      Claire Gallant, an ethereum fan who founded the Future Witch Facebook group, along with a corresponding art installation to fundraise for the crypto research startup Open Privacy, said she sees many similarities between cypherpunk values and witchcraft. (Open Privacy founder Sarah Jamie Lewis cheekily refers to herself as a cyberpunk witch on Twitter.)      “I think witchcraft and crypto are deeply involved with each other,” Gallant said.      After all, Gallant said, technology is “a little bit magic to us,” something that is spoken (and coded) into existence. Beyond that, cryptocurrency can enhance witches’ power by letting them transact beyond the grasp of restrictive mainstream commerce platforms.      “Whether it’s ritual objects or access to birth control in various places around the world … that whole scale applies to crypto as it applies to cash,” Gallant said, describing her interest as primarily feminist. “If you don't have privacy and security, you don’t own yourself anymore. So cryptocurrency is important for that.”      Although witches often use TikTok and Instagram to share spells and recipes, they have not always been welcome on e-commerce platforms. Etsy temporarily banned witchcraft-related sales in 2015, just as eBay did in 2012. Taboo or occult religious practices can sometimes be subject to financial censorship due to potential reputational risks. In 2017, witches reported being banned by Square for selling “occult” items.      That’s why feminist author Sophia Digregorio publishes manifestos about “How Witches and Occultists Can Use Bitcoin and Altcoins for Privacy and Anti-Discrimination.”      From Gallant’s perspective, the right to purchase objects for her own personal use is crucial. Even as these issues apply to all religious minorities, they are more likely to be censored if the person violating social norms is a woman.      Open Privacy’s Lewis found a similar motivation herself. She and Gallant are among the many crypto enthusiasts who incorporate spirituality into their tech experiments.      Freedom of religion    “When someone asked if I was an activist or a researcher, I told them I was a witch,” Lewis said.      “We’ve delegated what is ‘appropriate’ to sell, advertise or even believe to some extent to these platforms,” Lewis added, referring to platforms like eBay that have temporarily banned or penalized occult shops.    For a more recent example, the organizers behind the witchcraft pen-pal project Witch Swaphttps://www.witchswap.com/, which helps witches share books, crystals, tarot cards and other ritual tools, said they created a backup Instagram account after the original account wrongly triggered the platform’s community standards enforcement. On the other hand, Kelsey Lester-Perry, the entrepreneur behind KVLT Kreations online shop, said she accepts bitcoin although Etsy and Instagram still work for such sellers and novice learners most of the time.    “I get the best information from just having a dialogue with my community on Instagram,” Lester-Perry said. “There are certain keywords that you shouldn’t put in an Instagram post, like you shouldn’t use dollar signs. Their bots will catch those if you say the word ‘giveaway.’”      Yet, as the Witch Swap instance shows, accounts that promote witchcraft but don’t sell or directly distribute occult products can still attract scrutiny. All things considered, many tech-savvy witches believe the types of systems-thinking used in astrology or tarot deck readings can also apply to cryptocurrency ecosystems. And they see this technology as crucial to ensuring their future rights to freedom of religion, both in terms of commerce and self-expression.      “The acceptable norms are shrinking,” Lewis said. “We need these technologies and avenues to push back against that shrinkage. Without them, we live in a much smaller word.”",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/10/why-cypherpunk-witches-love-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d96cadd96521b6bc9deccec32df1131cbda907fd-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Ministry for Industry, Science, Energy and Resources has formulated a new national strategy aimed at capturing the potential value generated via business-related blockchain activity, with a particular focus on supporting global supply chain management systems and tracking.      The 52-page roadmap focuses on three main areas: ""regulation and standards;"" ""skills, capability and innovation;"" and ""international investment and collaboration.""      The plan is a revision to March 2019’s blockchain objectives, which intended to prioritize blockchain standards related to terminology, governance, security and identity.      Australia’s interest and investment in blockchain as a decentralized, peer-to-peer solution has been gaining ground because of the technology's promise to deliver significant cost savings across a number of industries including finance, energy and manufacturing.      Gartner, as cited in the new roadmap, predicts blockchain will generate a global annual business value of over US$175 billion by 2025 and in excess of US$3 trillion by 2030.      As reported by The Sydney Morning Herald last Friday, Karen Andrews, minister for Industry, Science and Technology, said the potential for blockchain to strengthen export opportunities was “exciting,” with its ability to help Australian producers track their goods and services across the global supply chain.      Within finance, the focus will be on identity checks as part of know-your-customer procedures, while within education the plan eyes ""trusted credentials and facilitating trusted information about an individual’s skills and capabilities.""
