Silvergate's CEO has come out in defense of the company. The current outlook for SI remains bearish, but I'd be interested in buying at lower prices. What You May Have Missed The FTX (FTTS-USD) collapse has been a major headline crypto-related news for the past few weeks. One of the biggest centralized exchanges (CEX) implosions seen in the crypto industry's history. FTX was a centralized cryptocurrency exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried (also popularly known by the initials SBF) in 2019. During its prime, FTX was ranked the third largest crypto exchange in terms of trade volume. There have been many claims and stories about the root cause of the FTX fiasco. In the wake of the FTX collapse, the crypto community has shown its information-digging prowess while regulators and legislators have been seeking answers. Based on the popular demand of the crypto community, some existing CEX has begun publishing their digital asset holdings via proof-of-work reserves. The FTX implosion has affected several crypto-based firms that have cited exposure to FTX and Alameda Research, FTX’s trading arm. Crypto lending platform BlockFi halted withdrawals as a result of its FTX exposure and has since filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. Genesis Trading, Celsius Network (CEL-USD), and Galois Capital are among the firms that have been affected by the FTX collapse. Silvergate Bank ( SI ) is one of the financial institutions at the core of the on-ramp and off-ramp of fiat on most US-based crypto exchanges. As the FTX contagion continues to spread, Silvergate Bank has become a part of the contagion. Silvergate's share price has fallen by over 40% in one month, as a reaction to the FUD generated over its links with FTX. The FTX Contagion Spreads to Silvergate Bank In the wake of the FTX debacle in early November, a statement regarding Silvergate FTX exposure was released by Silvergate. In the statement, Alan Lane, Chief Executive Officer of Silvergate, said: In light of recent developments, I want to provide an update on Silvergate’s exposure to FTX. As of September 30, 2022, Silvergate’s total deposits from all digital asset customers totaled $11.9 billion, of which FTX represented less than 10%. Silvergate has no outstanding loans to nor investments in FTX, and FTX is not a custodian for Silvergate’s bitcoin-collateralized SEN Leverage loans. To be clear, our relationship with FTX is limited to deposits. Source: Alan Lane A group of US lawmakers, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, has asked Silvergate to release its full records of FTX transactions; this will give closure into the potential role Silvergate Bank played in the collapse of the crypto exchange and into how Silvergate is connected to FTX. Silvergate has until December 19 to comply with the lawmakers' request. Your bank’s involvement in the transfer of FTX customer funds to Alameda reveals what appears to be an egregious failure of your bank’s responsibility to monitor for and report suspicious financial activity carried out by its clients, Source: Senator Elizabeth Warren In the wake of the FTX collapse, Lane has issued a statement . In the statement, Lane said Silvergate takes risk management and compliance very seriously and also claims extensive due diligence on FTX and Alameda Research was conducted. It has been a very difficult few weeks for the digital asset industry, as we have all come to terms with the apparent misuse of customer assets and other lapses of judgment by FTX and Alameda Research. There has also been plenty of speculation – and misinformation – being spread by short sellers and other opportunists trying to capitalize on market uncertainty, Source: Alan Lane Will FTX Impact Silvergate? In the statement by Lane, he reiterated that while it has been a turbulent time in the digital asset industry, customers’ deposits at Silvergate are, and have always been, safely held. In addition to the cash we carry on our balance sheet, our entire investment securities portfolio can be pledged for borrowings at the Federal Home Loan Bank, other financial institutions, and the Federal Reserve Discount Window – and can ultimately be sold should we need to generate liquidity to satisfy customer withdrawal request, Source: Alan Lane Silvergate shares have continued to drop amidst the FTX debacle. The stock price dropped by about 14% on Tuesday, December 14, reaching a two-year low and closing at $18.73 on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The Stock price has fallen by 90% year to date (YTD). In the latest developments in the FTX debacle, ex-CEO of the fallen crypto exchange Sam Bankman-Fried has been arrested by the authorities in the Bahamas, where he has been based, following formal notification by US authorities to the Bahamian government that criminal charges have been filed against Sam Bankman-Fried. A hearing by the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services was held on Tuesday, December 13, in which FTX post-collapse CEO John Ray III provided testimony. Sam Bankman-Fried has been denied bail in the Bahamas and will remain in custody until February 8, 2023, when he will appear in court. Technical Analysis With the recent drop in price, the technical picture doesn’t look great for SI, but we are still within an acceptable range for a retracement. Price Analysis (Author's work) We did break below the 61.8% retracement of wave 1, so the next key fib level is the 76.5% retracement, followed by the ultimate resistance level, the 88.7% retracement. Now, if we consider this a five-wave move to finish off a C wave, as labeled above, then the Fibonacci extensions project us into the $10 area. Wave 3 has almost hit the 2 extension at $16.42, so wave 5 could reach the next key fib level of 2.618. I might consider entering a trade if SI reaches this level, but investors must be wary that this is a high-risk/reward trade. Closing Remarks The FTX collapse has sent shockwaves through the crypto market. SI, Grayscale ( BTC )"" target=""_blank"">OTC:GBTC ) and now even Binance ( BNB-USD ), which is seeing huge withdrawals from its exchange, have all been negatively impacted.

The blockchain has seen significant growth in Daily Active Users, Total Value Locked on chain, and share of transactions. There is no native token of the Arbitrum blockchain. The best way to get exposure to Arbitrum's network growth is simply buying ETH. Crypto winter continues as investors close out 2022. We can only speculate whether we've seen the depths of the bear or if there are deeper token price discounts to come in 2023. Despite the severity of year-to-date drawdowns in most crypto-based assets, one network that has seen substantial growth over the last several months is Arbitrum. What is Arbitrum? Arbitrum is an Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) Layer 2 scaling chain that utilizes optimistic rollups. Because of the low TPS drawback of Ethereum, secondary layer blockchains like Arbitrum and Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) are necessary to truly scale the Ethereum network. Arbitrum is able to increase transactions per second by batching transactions together and considerably reducing the user fees associated with conducting activity on the Ethereum blockchain. Arbitrum's core developer is Offchain Labs . The developers envision Arbitrum's optimistic rollups main function to be scaling Ethereum in a decentralized manner: its design is geared heavily toward avoidance of introducing any centralization or trust assumptions, and it is thus a clear, strict net-win for the Ethereum ecosystem. Arbitrum is unique among many of the Ethereum scaling chains in that it doesn't have a native token. The Arbitrum users and developers can bridge Ethereum or stablecoins to Arbitrum and conduct transactions on the secondary chain without paying gas through any L2 chain-native currency; this would be counter to a network like Polygon which utilizes the MATIC token for gas on the secondary chain. Arbitrum Network Growth Arbitrum has experienced rather explosive growth in daily active users. According to Token Terminal, the average for the current week is over 74k DAUs. This is up 25% from 59k DAUs during the previous week and up nearly 14x from the 5k during the same week a year ago. Arbitrum DAUs (weekly average) (Token Terminal) This growth in users has helped drive greater share of Layer 2 transactions. When stacking the transactions on Optimism and Arbitrum with the transactions on Ethereum, we can see that not only are we getting more ecosystem transactions in aggregate, but a greater share of those transactions are happening on Arbitrum: Layer 2s vs ETH (Dune Analytics/Marcov) Excluding December because we still have several weeks remaining before the data will be final, each of the last 3 months have seen significant moves higher in the amount of transactions happening on both Arbitrum and Optimism. However, Arbitrum is growing slightly quicker. Arbitrum and Optimism were essentially at parity in August with a little over 2.4 million transactions each. By the end of November, Arbitrum accounted for 8.1 million transactions - nearly 2 million more than Optimism. These transactions represent a fairly diverse set of on-chain interactions. Arbitrum has seen growth in its NFT footprint over the last several weeks. The table below is sorted by buyers: Blockchain NFT Sales Volume Buyers Buyer Change Ethereum $432.8 million 112k -18% Solana ( SOL-USD ) $57 million 70k -57% Binance ( BNB-USD ) $4.4 million 26.2k +80% Arbitrum $979k 23.2k +122% Flow ( FLOW-USD ) $5.2 million 19.7k -15% Source: CryptoSlam, last 30 days The NFT market on Arbitrum has produced over 23k buyers over the last 30 days; up 122% from the prior period against a total NFT market that is down 25%. That buyer figure also puts Arbitrum as the 4th ranked blockchain by unique buyers behind only Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain. Despite the large move in buyers, the NFT sales volume on Arbitrum is well below peers at a little under $1 million. From the outside looking in, the early Arbitrum NFTs seem more geared toward a lower-cost buyer. This is a market that has been served well by Solana in the past. From a DeFi perspective, Arbitrum is a top 5 chain in the raw USD value figures: Arbitrum TVL (DeFi Llama) On November 14th, Arbitrum was the 6th largest chain by TVL. A month later, Arbitrum has passed both Polygon and Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) with $1.1 billion in total value locked as of submission. Rank Blockchain DeFi Protocols TVL 1m TVL Change Protocol Dominance 1 Ethereum 612 $24.62b -4.90% 26.1% 2 Binance 512 $4.46b -13.27% 52.9% 3 Tron ( TRX-USD ) 11 $4.4b -1.14% 65.0% 4 Arbitrum 149 $1.11b 24.39% 39.6% 5 Polygon 347 $1.06b -4.09% 24.8% 6 Avalanche 277 $847.17m -11.02% 39.1% 7 Optimism ( OP-USD ) 92 $550.05m -11.11% 18.9% 8 Fantom ( FTM-USD ) 269 $463.33m 9.19% 20.6% 9 Cronos ( CRO-USD ) 86 $425.07m -40.18% 44.1% 10 Solana 91 $290.67m -16.70% 31.3% Source: DeFi Llama Arbitrum has been quickly moving up the ranks in dollar-denominated TVL and has been one of the fastest growing chains by that metric over the last month. It's one of just 2 chains in the top 10 to have positive TVL performance in the last 30 days when denominated in dollars. Risks TVL is a decent way to measure a blockchain's DeFi footprint but there are other metrics to consider when assessing a chain's TVL. For instance, a healthy DeFi footprint shows diversification of TVL spread throughout various protocols. While Arbitrum has almost 150 protocols on the network, nearly 40% of Arbitrum's DeFi footprint is coming form a single protocol. That protocol is GMX ( GMX-USD ) and I've expressed concerns about that project in BlockChain Reaction. GMX is one of the more hyped crypto projects this year and has served as an Arbitrum proxy for speculators who can't gamble on Aribtrum's growth through a native token. I don't believe GMX has systemic risk to Arbitrum but it is something to keep in mind as some of the network usage growth is coming from a protocol that might have problematic tokenomics. Summary Arbitrum has been one of the few bright spots in the broader public blockchain market lately. We've seen Ethereum scaling solutions do far better from a user growth perspective than some of the high throughput Layer 1 chains that compete with Ethereum more directly. In my view, Arbitrum's lack of a native token could be an indication that the core development team's goals are a bit more in line with what proponents of public blockchain as a legitimate utility might be looking for. Namely, building solid infrastructure and worrying less about 'number go up' from a coin dumped on retail investors. Of course, given the lack of a native token, one can't really ""invest"" directly in Arbitrum through crypto rails. I believe the best way to gain exposure to Arbitrum is through applications built directly on Arbitrum or through simply buying Ethereum. In crypto winter, the latter is the far safer play.",NEUTRAL,ETH | MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | ICO | MATIC | ARB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4564554-arbitrum-betting-on-fast-growing-ethereum-chain?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5608446.jpeg

This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  If it becomes law, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act will bring know-your-customer (KYC) rules to crypto participants such as wallet providers and miners and prohibit financial institutions from transacting with digital asset mixers, which are tools designed to obscure the origin of funds.  The act would also allow the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to implement a proposed rule requiring institutions to report certain transactions involving unhosted wallets – wallets where the user has complete control over the contents rather than relying on an exchange or other third party.  Concerns over the use of crypto to facilitate money laundering and terrorist financing are frequently aired by lawmakers or regulators and are often used to highlight the need for more robust regulation of the digital asset industry.  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization lost hold of earlier gains and was recently trading at $17,800 after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates another 50 basis points at its last meeting of the year and signaled further increases were likely in 2023. BTC was trading as high as $18,356 right before the Fed’s announcement, over the $18,000 mark for the first time since early November. It’s up 0.5% in the past 24 hours. “Cryptos are getting dragged down as the dollar rallies with the return of risk aversion,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst of the Americas at Oanda, wrote in a Wednesday note.  Equity markets also turned red, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closing down 0.76%. The S&P 500 was down 0.61% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.42%.  Ether (ETH): The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap after bitcoin similarly followed BTC’s trajectory, sliding around 1% to $1,310 as of publication time. Earlier in the day, PayPal and MetaMask announced the payments company will integrate its buy, sell and hold crypto services with MetaMask Wallet as the companies look to broaden users' options to transfer digital assets from their platforms. Users will be able to buy and transfer ETH from PayPal to MetaMask.  Maple (MPL): Blockchain-based lending platform Maple Finance unveiled Wednesday a major protocol overhaul in an attempt to improve on shortcomings highlighted by a spate of recent loan defaults. The upgraded version includes improvements on the withdrawal request process, introducing an option to schedule and prorate withdrawals. Maple Finance's native MPL token was trading up as much as 6.9% in the past 24 hours on the news before falling back a 1.7% advance to $3.80, according to price tracking site CoinGecko  Latest Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 882.61 −1.9 ▼ 0.2% Bitcoin (BTC) $17,834 +73.0 ▲ 0.4% Ethereum (ETH) $1,311 −9.7 ▼ 0.7% S&P 500 daily close 3,995.32 −24.3 ▼ 0.6% Gold $1,819 +4.8 ▲ 0.3% Treasury Yield 10 Years 3.5% ▲ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: Focus on Bitcoin's Price Charts, Not Hawkishness From Fed's Powell  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Let’s unpack this week’s move up past $18,000 for the first time since Nov. 10. Does the move have real merit, or is it just a short term relief rally? It could be that – just the mere fact that we're asking the question is a sign for optimism.  Historically, on a seasonal basis, the market is not entering a time of the year of strong performance. From a price-chart perspective, bitcoin’s roughly $17,900 level moves the asset into a “low volume node” region – possibly indicating the potential for quick price moves.  Volume nodes can be identified as zones on a price chart using the Volume Profile Visible Range tool, showing trading activity by price point. A high volume node represents areas of significant price agreement, which often coincides with slower price movement.  By contrast, low volume nodes represent areas of low activity. Prices have the tendency to move rapidly through these areas until they reach the next area of agreement. An illustration of this can be seen in the 14% decline that took place on Nov 9. Bitcoin has now entered that same space, but to the upside this time around.  Read the full technical take here.

The miner announced a partnership with energy technology company Lancium earlier this year for an initial 200 megawatts (MW) of power capacity in west Texas, which translates to 6.6 EH/s of hashrate, with an option for an additional 300MW in the future.  However, Lancium informed CleanSpark that capital constraints have affected its ability to meet its commitments, according to a statement. The expected completion dates have been pushed into late 2023 or even later, which led to the guidance cut by the miner.  Crypto miners have been severely affected by the current crypto winter as the price of bitcoin has slumped, killing their revenue. Meanwhile, energy prices have soared, increasing their costs. This has resulted in one of the biggest mining data center operators in the U.S., Compute North, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September, while big players such as Core Scientific (CORZ), Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and Greenidge Generation (GREE) have all said they are experiencing a liquidity crunch.  In addition to the guidance cut, CleanSpark said that its fourth-quarter revenue rose 235% compared to the same period last year. Meanwhile, its net loss widened by 683% year over year, mainly due to the impairment of goodwill and bitcoin balances as well as non-cash charges due to modification of equity instruments, the company said in the statement.  Shares of the miner have fallen 12% on Thursday, while the price of bitcoin also declined about 2%. CleanSpark's shares have fared slightly better than most peers, falling about 79% this year, compared to other miners such as Core Scientific (CORZ) and Marathon Digital (MARA), whose shares have declined more than 80% this year.

42411288,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMigc,1671055273,After FTX: Explaining the Difference Between Liquidity and Insolvency,"There’s a brutal liquidity squeeze going on. As central banks withdraw fiat currency from their economies at a rate not seen since the early 1980s, financial institutions that have relied on easy money are finding it hard to survive. The crypto industry is among the worst affected, with company after company experiencing “liquidity crises” that force them to stop withdrawals and cut back lending. But if a “liquidity crisis” is so bad that the company ends up in the bankruptcy courts, the problem is not liquidity – it’s solvency.  A company can recover from liquidity problems, if the business is sound and the assets valuable. Like a plant, watering can get it through a dry spell. But if it is diseased, no amount of water will save it. Lending to a company that is failing because its business model is corrupt and unsustainable is throwing money down the drain. So, it’s important to know whether a failing company is merely suffering from a ""liquidity crisis” or is actually insolvent.  Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.  However, it's not always easy to distinguish between liquidity and solvency. And it can be convenient for companies to focus only on the short-term cash need and ignore deeper issues. FTX, Celsius Network, BlockFi and Voyager Digital all desperately tried to persuade people to lend them money to keep them going. All of them have ended up in the bankruptcy courts.  To be fair, it is not just crypto companies that say they are merely suffering from a “liquidity crisis” when they are actually insolvent. Traditional financial institutions are just as likely to say everything will be fine if only someone will lend them some more money. For example, RBS, the British bank whose disastrous collapse in October 2008 nearly took down the U.K.’s payments system, insisted it just needed more funding. But it eventually needed a U.K. government bailout costing some 46 billion British pounds (that’s $56.58 billion at today’s exchange rate, but the GBP/USD exchange rate was much higher in October 2008, so the USD equivalent then was about $69 billion).  The confusion between liquidity and solvency is partly caused by the generally accepted definition of “insolvency,” which is “unable to meet obligations as they fall due.” This sounds very much like shortage of cash, i.e., a liquidity crisis. But shortage of cash isn’t necessarily insolvency. Suppose a company that has lots of long-term assets but very little cash is suddenly hit with a margin call on an interest rate swap. It must find more cash in a hurry but, provided there are buyers for its assets or lenders willing to advance cash against its assets, it can meet its obligations. It is not insolvent.  Read more: Frances Coppola – Crypto’s 1907 Moment  But suppose the company’s assets mainly consist of a large pile of claims on other companies that are also experiencing “liquidity crises” and have as a result defaulted on their obligations. No one is going to buy those assets, and no one is going to lend any money against the security of those assets either. So the company cannot meet its obligations. It is insolvent. As, of course, are the other companies. This is what happens in systemic crises like the one that has engulfed the crypto world. Voyager’s claims on Three Arrows Capital made up over a quarter of its assets: When Three Arrows failed, those assets became effectively worthless. Three Arrows Capital was itself rendered insolvent by the collapse of Terra. When companies are connected by chains of claims, the insolvency of one company can result in domino-like collapses across an entire industry.  Balance sheets that contain large amounts of “intangible assets” – things you can’t kick – are most likely to end up catastrophically insolvent. Crypto companies with balance sheets full of their own issued tokens, for example. Or conventional conglomerates that have overpaid for acquisitions and ended up with a balance sheet full of unrealizable future cash flows from those acquisitions – what accountants call “goodwill.” Goodwill evaporates in insolvency. So does the value of tokens.  But Sam Bankman-Fried insisted that FTX failed because of a “run on the bank.” So what are bank runs? Are they merely liquidity crises or are they insolvency?  Contrary to popular opinion, so-called “fractional reserve” banks are not generally insolvent. Their assets exceed their liabilities: In banking parlance, the difference between the two is known as “capital,” and for licensed banks the size and composition of that difference is governed by capital regulations. The problem is that most of their liabilities must be repaid on demand, but their assets mainly consist of a pile of long-term loans and securities that can’t be called and might not easily be sold or pledged for cash either. So they are chronically short of cash. If depositors all try to withdraw their deposits at the same time, fractional reserve banks can literally run out of money.  Read more: David Z. Morris - FTX’s Collapse Was a Crime, Not an Accident  “Reserve requirements” aim to ensure that banks have sufficient cash on hand to meet the normal daily volume of deposit withdrawals, but they aren’t intended to cope with bank runs. So licensed banks that experience runs can, as a last resort, borrow cash from central banks against the security of their assets. There’s a caveat – the bank must be solvent. The “Bagehot Principle” says that in a financial crisis a central bank should lend freely, at a penalty rate, to solvent firms, in exchange for “good” securities.  What happens to customer deposits when a bank becomes insolvent? Legally, deposits are loans to banks, and depositors are creditors. In insolvency, depositors are only entitled to a share of the bank’s remaining assets, not return of their money. So depositors can lose some or all of their money. Rumors that a bank is insolvent can therefore cause bank runs. Deposit insurance schemes such as FDIC discourage runs by guaranteeing that most depositors will get their money back.  But it’s not just fractional reserve banks that can suffer runs. Any financial institution that has long-term assets and very short-term liabilities, or liabilities that can become payable without warning, is at risk of runs. Most of these don’t have central bank support or FDIC insurance. FTX wasn’t a bank, but it did experience a run. And because the run was triggered by fear that FTX was insolvent, FTX couldn’t persuade anyone to lend it the money to survive the run.  Was FTX already insolvent when the run happened? Yes. The ”liquidity crisis” that brought it to its knees was caused by its insolvency, not vice versa. Will depositors lose money? Almost certainly. FTX has a gaping hole in its balance sheet, and no one seems remotely interested in plugging it.  When the bottom has fallen out of your bucket, pouring more water into it won’t fix it. It will just waste water. Nonetheless, if you can find a reliable source of water, you can continue to give the impression that your bucket is sound. Similarly, insolvent companies can continue to trade if they can persuade enough people to part with their money (yes, I know, this is illegal but it nevertheless happens). Too many trusting souls have been lured by promises of high returns into handing over their life savings to insolvent companies.  So it’s important that anyone thinking of putting money into a crypto company does due diligence.

42411671,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfEib,1671055221,What Is a Multisig Wallet?,"Cryptocurrency communities have long been known for being passionate about their favorite tokens and projects. One longstanding debate in the crypto community that has been known to cause friction even among specific communities: hot versus cold crypto storage.  For the hot storage camp, the convenience and low costs makes hot storage by far the most favorable. Cold storage supporters, on the other hand, will rally about their method’s security using the old adage: “not your keys, not your crypto.” While cold storage offers increased security from traditional hot storage wallets, there's often a legitimate need to keep your crypto online. Further, “not your keys, not your crypto” solutions can get difficult when it’s not a single person’s crypto that needs to be safely stored, but a business or group that needs to keep crypto assets safe.  See Also: How Do Hardware Wallets Keep Your Crypto Safe?  In this article, we’ll take a look at an effective way of increasing asset security without using cold storage with multisignature (multisig) wallets, including how they work and why they’ve become a popular tool for institutions and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).  Multisig basics  Multisig wallets, also sometimes called multisig vaults or safes, are a type of crypto wallet that requires two or more private keys to perform certain tasks. This is done to increase the security of the funds stored in the wallet by requiring multiple parties to sign off before sending any transactions. The process of a multisig wallet works by requiring multiple signatures from a set of predetermined addresses, and if any one of these signatures is missing, the transaction will not be able to go through. Think of it as a safe with unique keys that must be used together to open it.  While there are many different types of multisig wallets, there are two top-level types: the first type requires all parties to attest or sign to a transaction, most commonly three-key wallets, and the second type requires a certain number out of the total pool to participate for a transaction to process, for example, two of three or three of five.  The process of signing transactions on multisig wallets differs from traditional wallets due to a key design difference. Traditional wallets are known as externally owned accounts (EOA), meaning they are generated by users and controlled by private keys. EOAs are generally considered to be “user accounts,” meaning they are created for members of the general public to interact with blockchains.  Multisig wallets, on the other hand, are smart contract-based wallets. Rather than being endpoints controlled by a user, these smart wallets are controlled by code and governed on-chain by their owners. Because of this setup, multisig wallets are considered a “seedless” form of self-custody.  Benefits of using a multisig wallet  In addition to increased security and multi-party participation, there are several other benefits for using a multisig wallet. Particularly for institutions and DAOs, the structure of multisig wallets provides a significantly better experience compared to using traditional hot or cold wallets.  No 'key person' risk  First, the design structure of multisig wallets eliminates traditional ""key person"" risk. Key person risk refers to when a company relies almost entirely on a single individual to succeed. This risk is all too common in crypto, particularly in instances where one individual is in control of a wallet’s seed phrase. One of the most infamous examples of this is in the case of crypto exchange QuadrigaCX. After the sudden death of its founder, it turned out he was the sole key holder for the exchange’s cold storage, which allegedly held $190 million worth of customer deposits that was inaccessible.  Because multisig wallets require multiple signatures from a number of participants in order to complete a transaction, they are able to eliminate key person risk and mitigate any single point of failure. Implementations like the two-of-three multisig can further ensure that essential transactions can go through despite one key party being absent at the time of the transaction.  Greater transparency  Multisig wallets provide increased transparency compared with other types of wallets. Transaction policies, signers and actual transactions are all made publicly available on chain or in the code. This allows for a clear picture of the rules for transactions and accountability of those who participate in directing funds.  Further, the open-source nature of multisig wallets allows anyone to view the code that governs them. Through clear, open development, anyone is able to audit the wallets and ensure that funds remain safe and secure.  Buildable  Due to a multisig’s position as a smart wallet, it can be easily adjusted or upgraded to fit the needs of an institution or DAO. Building on top of the wallet, developers can create protocols and models that can allow for more complex actions including DAO voting or asset management services. Platforms such as Juicebox have enabled groups of people to develop community-owned, programmable wallets that enjoy the power of multisigs.

42411290,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMinE,1671055200,"After Sam Bankman-Fried's Arrest, the FTX Show Goes On","Strap in folks: It’s a big week. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and current FTX CEO John J. Ray III were supposed to speak to the House Financial Services Committee. Obviously, things didn’t quite work out that way.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Oh jeez  The narrative  Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) will spend Christmas behind bars after a judge denied him bail. FTX’s bankruptcy case continues moving through the U.S. court system and, wow, there's been a lot of hearings this week.  Why it matters  These legal cases are going to be interesting.  Breaking it down  I originally planned to write a “what might SBF say” piece based on his various media interviews and whatnot.  And then he got arrested. And then Forbes published his prepared testimony. And then the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission came out with their own charges.  What a week.  So, to recap: Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested Monday night by the Royal Bahamas Police Force, after learning from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York that a grand jury had indicted him.  The indictment was unsealed Tuesday morning, revealing that prosecutors charged Bankman-Fried with wire fraud against both investors and lenders, conspiracy for the same, conspiracy to commit money laundering and some securities fraud and campaign finance-related counts for good measure.  The Securities and Exchange Commission came in with its own charges, alleging that Bankman-Fried misled investors on multiple occasions and that he committed various forms of securities fraud.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission likewise targeted Bankman-Fried’s various public statements, alleging those statements impacted the price of commodities.  Bankman-Fried appeared in a courthouse in the Bahamas. A judge denied him bail and scheduled an extradition hearing for February. But if you read anything, you have to read this incredible piece from the ground by Cheyenne Ligon, who attended the Bahamas hearing.  I’d also recommend this excellent analysis by Danny Nelson on what these various lawsuits reveal about the closeness of Alameda Research and FTX.  Elsewhere, Bankman-Fried’s successor as CEO of FTX, John J. Ray III, had basically a grand old time testifying before the House Financial Services Committee about how poorly run the company was under its prior leadership. Jesse Hamilton recaps the highlights here.  FTX’s other travails  FTX continues to enjoy a troubled bankruptcy process. In its first bankruptcy hearing, its attorneys argued that the names and other information tied to the exchange’s creditors should be withheld for now, contrary to normal bankruptcy practices.  Judge John Dorsey of the federal Bankruptcy Court of Delaware agreed, at least for now: He ruled that the names and other personally identifiable information (PII) should remain under seal for the moment. There will be a hearing to discuss this on Dec. 16.  Late last week, a number of news organizations, including Bloomberg, Dow Jones, the New York Times and the Financial Times, filed to join the bankruptcy case in order to argue that – at the least – the names of the creditors should be released.  “Debtors claim that their ‘customer list, and related customer data, is an important and valuable asset of the Debtors and the Debtors maintain their customer list in strict confidence,’” the filing said. “They also claim that ‘Public dissemination of the Debtors’ customer list could give the Debtors’ competitors an unfair advantage to contact and poach those customers and would interfere with the Debtors’ ability to sell their assets and maximize value for their estates at the appropriate time.’”  The news organizations are not convinced by this argument, calling it vague and saying that a concern about competition does not rise to the level necessary to redact the names of a bankruptcy estate’s creditors.  The news organizations also specified that in this cas, they’re only looking for names, and not the addresses or contact information for creditors, though they added that these types of redactions should not be normalized if there isn’t a threat to the creditors.  The crypto industry is likely to argue that there is a threat, that crypto investors are targets because they hold valuable, easily transferable assets.  We saw this whole thing happen earlier this year with Celsius Network, which filed for bankruptcy protection a few months ago. Some 600,000 customer accounts were revealed, including wallet addresses, transaction histories and crypto holdings. This information could easily make someone a target for a malicious actor hoping for an easy score.  On the other hand, bankruptcies are matters of public record and the U.S. does have a system that publishes creditor names for various reasons, including having a list of people to notify. What’s more, if FTX’s creditors want to recover their funds they'll have to share their own names anyway, the news organizations pointed out.  “The Court has indicated that proofs of claim will not be submitted anonymously. If disclosure is inevitable, there is no point to keeping the names anonymous now,” the filing said.  Where things start to get kind of odd is with the U.S. Trustee’s office, which also objected to redacting the names of creditors. That entity’s filing points out that FTX doesn’t even want to file the names under seal, which is somewhat unusual.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  The Senate Banking Committee advanced the FDIC nominations, including that of current Acting Director Martin Gruenberg, to the full Senate.  Outside CoinDesk:  (CoinDesk) No ruling yet on whether the CFTC can serve an entire decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) through a web forum but the judge in the Ooki DAO case wants to know why bZeroX founders Tom Bean and Kyle Kistner haven’t been served with the case.

""People did mistakes and there will probably be some other mistakes that are coming out of the crypto industry. That doesn't mean the whole industry is going to fall apart,"" the Carlyle Group co-founder told CNBC. Rubenstein's comments come in the wake of last month's revelation that closely watched venture capital firm Sequoia Capital had zeroed down its investment of over $210M in cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Rubenstein added that increased regulation might have increased the amount of information available ahead of the FTX collapse. He predicted that U.S. lawmakers would take about a year to pass legislation after the FTX scandal. ""Most likely the SEC will be the main regulating body [for crypto] because people would say this is securities we're dealing with and not just commodities, and the SEC is tough in this area,"" he said. Explaining his one-year timeline for potential legislation increasing crypto oversight, Carlyle co-founder pointed to historical precedent. He noted that it took a year to come up with legislation after Enron's bankruptcy in 2001. Rubenstein reported that he has not invested in any of the cryptocurrencies. He added that Carlyle has also not invested in crypto even though the firm has invested in some companies that serve the industry. The cryptocurrency market has come under pressure in 2022, dragged down by a general move away from risk assets and a wave of collapses, of which FTX represented the most specular example.

Bankman-Fried was expected to testify before the committee until his arrest Monday.

Called Magic Eden Rewards, the new feature will allow users to create a profile across all wallets and will award users with “Magic Points” based on secondary trading transactions on the platform.  For every 1 SOL traded, users earn five “Magic Points,” placing users in one of five loyalty tiers. This ranking system will reward users with unique benefits, including exclusive creator content, partner discounts, and NFT giveaways airdropped directly to their profile.  Magic Eden also plans to introduce dynamic fee pricing into the tiering structure. This means that instead of flat fees for trading, the amount that users and creators pay to transact will depend on their marketplace activity and will be be distributed between sellers and buyers.  Magic Eden’s effort to introduce loyalty rewards to its marketplace comes after it moved to a royalty optional model in October, which caused its trading volume to dip. Earlier this month, the marketplace rolled back its decision and launched an opt-in tool that will allow creators to enforce royalties on their projects.  Magic Eden CEO Jack Lu and head of marketing Tiffany Huang told CoinDesk that the Magic Eden Rewards program will allow collectors and creators to better collaborate through an infrastructure that entices engagement.  “We want Magic Eden to be a place where collectors and creators connect beyond the transactional level and instead, a hub where users can more deeply engage with the community,” said Lu and Huang.",POSITIVE,SOL,MINING | SOL | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/12/14/nft-marketplace-magic-eden-rolls-out-rewards-program,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/001b34057bd33735d9dd61841f4ec0455a26a45b-838x629.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411048,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBE9K,1671051434,A Snapshot of the 2023 Crypto Regulatory Landscape,"Crypto regulation is a wild beast, but few deny that the market desperately needs wrangling. After the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, John Ray III, the former Enron undertaker whom the court appointed to lead the defunct crypto exchange through one of the worst bankruptcy proceedings of all time, declared that he’d never seen “such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.”  Indeed, few of those heralded as the golden children of crypto are held in such radiant light today. Do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of Terraform Labs, is on the run from prosecutors since the collapse of Terra earlier this year. Three Arrows Capital, the crypto hedge fund that failed to repay loans after Terra’s collapse, also went bankrupt, sparking the collapse of lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, leaving customer funds in the lurch and pummeling all the other companies from which Three Arrows had borrowed money.  Regulators and lawmakers are now picking up the pieces and investigating why the companies collapsed. The U.S. House Financial Services Committee is holding a hearing on FTX this week, and investigations will likely carry into the new year. After FTX went bust, FINRA started collecting information about crypto marketing practices – which could result in new policy. CoinDesk’s Nik De said that “lawmakers are paying attention,” and that this is the kind of case that investigators are interested in prosecuting. This could continue the drive of “regulation through litigation” that has dominated crypto for years.  So, what are regulators doing next year to patch up the industry, and are new laws needed to prevent another FTX-style collapse?  1. Regulators will litigate  Regulators have long litigated the bad apples in crypto. In 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Kim Kardashian for shilling ethereumMax during the 2021 bull market, as well as a number of other high-profile celebrities. The Treasury Department settled with BitPay over letting people in sanctioned countries, including North Korea and Iran, use its platform, and in March 2022, the DOH launched a taskforce to enforce sanctions against Russia.  A note from law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP said that the U.S. government will likely continue its litigation in 2023, and that “we will see additional crypto-related sanctions guidance, enforcement actions and designations in the near term,” partly influenced by President Joe Biden’s executive order on crypto from March 2022, which required federal agencies to report on the industry.  The coming year will surely bring no shortage of litigation. In August 2022, the Treasury Department added sanctions against Tornado Cash, a decentralized crypto-mixing service for Ethereum. The SEC will also continue its case against XRP creator Ripple Labs, whom it alleged sells XRP in unregistered securities sales. Bankruptcy courts will continue to settle the matters of Three Arrows Capital, FTX, Voyager and Celsius (plus the companies their collapses claim as victims), no doubt setting legal precedents for the industry.  2. Policymakers and regulators will mull new laws  Preventing another FTX-style collapse is at the forefront of every government body’s mind. In the U.K., the deputy governor of the Bank of England called on Britain to “continue to bring these activities and entities within regulation.” New regulation, he said, would ensure that new stablecoins “meet standards equivalent to those expected of commercial bank money.” In the U.S., Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has called for customer funds to be segregated from company assets.  On the regulatory front, the Senate Agriculture Committee’s Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA) wants to protect people from another Celsius or Voyager by setting strict rules on customers’ assets. If it goes ahead, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) would oversee its implementation and litigate those who break the rules, but there’s pushback: critics think this could make decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols harder to operate. In an op-ed for CoinDesk, Cato Institute’s Jennifer Schulp and Jack Solowey argued that it threatens “DeFi’s unique features of composability and permissionlessness.”  But perhaps introducing a ton of new laws is not the way forward.  “We have very strong investor and consumer protection laws for most of our financial products and markets that are designed to address these risks,” said Yellen in a statement following FTX’s collapse, while calling for “more effective oversight of cryptocurrency markets.”  Lisa Braganca, a former SEC branch chief, thinks new regulations, if any, will not come from Congress but from the SEC and the CFTC.  “I have serious doubts still about whether Congress wants to step in and do something rather than letting the SEC and the CFTC figure it out,” she told CoinDesk.  SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce called on the two regulators to collaborate on fresh regulation, telling CoinDesk: “Having one regulator devoted to crypto could be problematic.”  Critics of the regulators argue the SEC didn’t do enough to prevent FTX from running away with customer funds, and the collapse could prompt the regulator to revise its policies. Harvard Law School emeritus professor Hal Scott and Committee on Capital Markets Regulation research director John Gulliver argued in an op-ed in Financial News that an SEC accounting rule dissuaded reputable large banks from holding crypto assets. They wrote: “If the SEC rescinded this bulletin, banks and affiliated broker-dealers could offer their services to U.S. investors in cryptoassets and to crypto exchanges, placing cryptoassets in the hands of the safest custodians in the world.”  3. Stablecoin legislation  The Biden administration’s report on stablecoins earlier this year proposed stablecoin regulation as well as the possibility of a digital dollar. 2023 could finally see some movement in a key stablecoin bill. Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), one of the sponsors of the bill, which would allow the Federal Reserve to license stablecoin issuers, described it as a “pretty ugly baby” because of the competing disputes, chiefly about who should regulate stablecoin issuers.  If it’s the Federal Reserve, stablecoin issuers could borrow money from the central bank or insurance coverage from the FDIC. Its wording could affect major U.S. stablecoin issuers, like Circle and Paxos.  4. Europe will implement landmark crypto regulation – with a catch  The European Union has charged ahead of the pack, and next year will continue to push through the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation. Law firm Akin Gump called the legislation “one of the first attempts globally at comprehensive regulation of cryptocurrency markets.”  The bill is wide-ranging, covering money laundering, the environment, corporate reporting and consumer protection. It would require stablecoin issuers to hold enough reserves to prevent their collapse, and would require crypto miners to disclose their energy consumption. What’s more, any exchanges that operate in the region will have to be monitored by a financial regulator from an EU member state.  Although it was supposed to be voted into law in early 2023, with the final text published in October 2022, BNP Paribas thinks that it’ll be delayed to the second half of 2024 – or 18 months after the law is published in the EU’s Official Journal.

42420846,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtVfh,1671050737,"Crypto Markets Analysis: Focus on Bitcoin's Price Charts, Not Hawkishness From Fed's Powell","Just after a better-than-expected U.S. inflation report had left investors in a good mood, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had to come in and spoil it.  The bitcoin (BTC) price fell Wednesday as traders reacted to the Fed's signals that monetary-tightening could continue well into 2023, even as the pace slows.  Instead of dwelling on the short-term retreat, investors might be better off focusing on the fact that, however briefly, they got a glimpse this week of a price trend resembling anything remotely bullish. It's something traders haven’t seen or even contemplated since the initial tremors in early November that ultimately led to the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange.  Lingering fears of FTX-related contagion risk still permeate markets, while looming concerns about Binance’s reserves and stability have sprouted as well. Up to this point, bitcoin has performed poorer than normal in December, while leading into traditionally bearish January. Whether concerns about Binance are grounded in legitimacy or rooted in post-FTX fear could be clearer in coming weeks.  In the meantime let’s unpack this week’s move up past $18,000 for the first time since Nov. 10. Does the move have real merit, or is it just a short term relief rally? It could be that – just the mere fact that we're asking the question is a sign for optimism.  Historically, on a seasonal basis, the market is not entering a time of the year of strong performance.  From a price-chart perspective, bitcoin’s roughly $17,900 level moves the asset into a “low volume node” region – possibly indicating the potential for quick price moves.  Volume nodes can be identified as zones on a price chart using the Volume Profile Visible Range tool, showing trading activity by price point. A high volume node represents areas of significant price agreement, which often coincides with slower price movement.  By contrast, low volume nodes represent areas of low activity. Prices have the tendency to move rapidly through these areas until they reach the next area of agreement. An illustration of this can be seen in the 14% decline that took place on Nov 9. Bitcoin has now entered that same space, but to the upside this time around.  The next high volume node appears near $19,100, approximately 7% higher than current prices.  Momentum for bitcoin has jumped 23% since Monday when using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) as a proxy for measurement. The movement from 51 to 63 reflects an uptick in buying pressure while coinciding with an increase in volume.  Now – the macroeconomic picture. Inflation concerns still linger, but they're moving toward less panic-worthy levels.  As expected, on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point), after four consecutive 75 bps hikes.  Powell's comments indicated that the U.S. central bank is committed to fighting inflation and can’t stop too soon, but that any changes to the underlying economic data will be evaluated.  The tone was hawkish, and the market reacted accordingly.  Bond market yields responded to Fed's comments with increased yields for two-year U.S. Treasurys, which maintains an inverted yield curve when set against its 10-year counterpart.  The increase in short-term interest rates implies questions on short term economic prospects, and expectations for more aggressive Fed interest rate hikes.  As market prices reflect future expectations for an asset’s prospects, the notion that we are a step closer to the end of Fed tightening is a welcome sight, even if that has yet to come into full focus.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/14/crypto-markets-analysis-focus-on-bitcoins-price-charts-not-hawkishness-from-feds-powell,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e3fa3bfe561b1eb41ee6ed2246a19e8b326f64e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

B Riley said it is prepared to fund the first $40 million of the new financing immediately, with ""zero contingencies."" The remainder of the financing is contingent on all principal payments to equipment lenders being suspended at bitcoin prices of $18,500 and below. Above that threshold, however, free cash flow from operations will be distributed to equipment lenders.

Core Scientific is one of several miners struggling to keep afloat as rising energy prices increase costs, while stubbornly low bitcoin prices slash revenues. The company went public in Jan. 20 after merging with Power & Digital Infrastructure Acquisition in a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transaction.  B Riley said that Core has about $300 million in total loans that have a very short maturity and were taken on by the miner during the peak of the crypto market. ""These debts were incurred as part of an aggressive, ill-conceived strategy by the company to continue to build out power facilities and expand miners while never selling bitcoin on hand and never hedging prices,"" the investment bank said in a statement.

After advancing as much as 3.2% just moments before the Fed's monetary policy decision, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) erased all of its gains, rising 0.1% to $17.75K as of 3:33 p.m. ET. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), though, turned negative after climbing 2.3% pre-Fed, now down 0.9% to $1.30K. Risk assets started to sell off after the U.S. central bank decided to lift its benchmark rate by 50 basis points to a target range of 4.25%-4.50%, the highest level in 15 years, as expected. That represented a downshift from the 75-bp hikes at each of its previous four meetings. At the same time, the Fed's dot plot ultimately supported a higher for longer narrative, as the officials' median projection now expect the federal funds rate to reach 5.1% in 2023, compared with 4.6% in its September projection. Fed policymakers expect to pause rates at that level with cuts not starting until 2024. Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that monetary policy will need to be restrictive ""for some time"" in an effort to get inflation down toward the central bank's 2% objective. He noted that the past two months of softer CPI data weren't enough for him to be confident that inflation is falling in a meaningful way.

42407230,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJsFr,1671049752,"Forget CBDCs, Here’s Where the Biden Administration Needs to Focus in 2023","This fall, the Biden administration in the U.S. released a framework outlining a potential way to regulate the emerging digital asset industry. The report also came with a proposal for studying a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which seems like the direction the whole world is heading.  Today, nearly every country with a central bank is studying or developing a CBDC, according to the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). At their best, CBDCs could advance certain national priorities like bolstering financial inclusion and simplifying tax collection.  That’s what the BIS suggests. What the “central bank of central banks” is less likely to say, however, is that there are significant downsides to concentrating even more monetary power in the hands of institutions like the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Cathy Yoon is the chief legal officer of MPCH Labs. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023.  A CBDC, which can be but is not necessarily built on a blockchain, would differ drastically from other forms of crypto assets because they are inherently centralized and permissioned by design. If the government is going to get involved in the digital money race, it should do so on the principles of openness and transparency.  The Biden White House’s proposed CBDC would likely be administered by the government and a coterie of banking partners in the old-fashioned, neoliberal tradition of public-private partnerships. Although CBDC boosters pay lip service to the ideal of “financial privacy,” there are still widespread and justified concerns over allowing the government to see the details of everyone’s finances on a minute-by-minute basis.  And, yes, it is true that a U.S. dollar-based CBDC would likely promote the international use of the dollar – thereby strengthening the currency against the Chinese digital yuan, which is being piloted today in no small part to one day bolster the Chinese Communist Party’s international “soft power” – this also comes with concerns.  To put it one way, CBDCs, at their core, are a tool that allows the government to fully politicize money. Today, no one can prevent you from spending the dollar bills in your pockets, because they are what’s known as a bearer instrument. A digital dollar would be programmable, meaning its functionality sits with those that can update the code.  A government, for instance, might be able to use a CBDC to incentivize citizens to purchase certain products, ban the trade of others and cut off individuals or businesses from their funds on a whim (like how police seize websites). With this kind of power at their disposal, it’s hard to imagine it would be utilized.  See also: Why Hong Kong Is Pushing for Its Own CBDC | Crypto 2023  A CBDC would be a massive undertaking in the mold of Depression Era or post-war infrastructure projects. So-called megaprojects can be sources of national pride and catalysts of economic growth – like the interstate highway system. However, instead of developing a CBDC, it would be much more productive and impactful for the White House to focus on different kinds of financial initiatives to benefit the public good.  I propose, instead of throwing resources and tax dollars at a CBDC project, the Biden administration should investigate a decentralized identification program and develop financial literacy programs for the general public.  Expanding the reach of financial services for all Americans  Currently, access to financial services is often limited by geographical location, onerous know-your-customer (KYC) procedures and the U.S.’ embarrassing history of class and racial inequality. A new digital identification system could go a long way in improving this situation.  The idea of a digital identity (DID) is to allow for one’s identity to be proven and maintained in alternative ways. It could be a way to harmonize the hodgepodge of details that banks and financial institutions often require for setting up accounts, such as previous bank statements, proof of residency and utility bills – altogether known as personally identifiable information (PII).  Further, blockchain-based DIDs bring with them the benefits of blockchain-guaranteed immutability and censorship-resistance. The concept of decentralized identity existed well before Web3, and is closely related to the dream of self-sovereign identity (SSI).  At their core, DIDs and SSIs are about enabling citizens rather than centralized institutions to control their own information. What form they take is still being worked out (Jack Dorsey’s Block, for instance, wants to jump straight to “Web5” using non-blockchain “verified credentials”), but in either case would be a radical departure from the current record-keeping regime. Simplify identity management now!  Improving efficiency and security with blockchain technology  Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging alternative to traditional finance without the middlemen. It offers many of the same services as Wall Street, including lending, credit and brokerage, but when done right it ensures that transactions are verifiable and platforms open for all.  While a number of of crypto’s centralized institutions disgraced the industry this year, DeFi proved its worth. None of the insider trading, theft of customer funds or preferential treatment seen at some crypto companies is possible when DeFi protocols are shipped correctly. Instead, these open financial platforms make everyone play by the same rules – and open the books for verification.  Regulators should embrace emerging technologies as a means to better allow market participants to become more efficient, cost-effective and secure. Blockchain, in conjunction with other cryptographic layers such as multi-party computation, could allow financial institutions to improve internal process management while also leaving a transparent and auditable trail as a means to provide assurances to customers, investors and regulators.  Regulators have a unique opportunity, working together with some of the brightest minds in the space to help steer technology that will inevitably help financial institutions, their customers and the economy become more streamlined and secure.  By developing smart regulations for smart contracts (rather than quashing it), the government can help erect ecosystem guardrails to make these admittedly sometimes-complex systems safer to use for everyone.  Considering the pace of digital adoption is not slowing, a digitally native and digitally secure financial system makes sense. More of the world’s assets will be tokenized. Regulators that nurture the development of new technologies will ultimately help the U.S. financial system become more prosperous than it has ever been.  Focusing on financial literacy  To some extent, the crypto industry is a mirror into the poor state of financial education. It’s a sad fact that scams proliferate across the industry, in no small part because many do not know basics of investing – and can be tricked into thinking an unsustainable yield farm is sound.  If individuals are empowered with financial education at a young age, they can be in a position to think critically on their own. The government, like crypto itself, should encourage people to do their own research – something that would remove the need for the government to nuke all of Web3.  Regulation and education have always walked together hand in hand: In just about every Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement action, for instance, the agency encourages people to think critically about what they invest in.  Financial literacy puts financial liberation in the hands of each and every individual. It’s essential to the evolution and improvement of any society and ultimately benefits the economy by encouraging sustained growth from the ground up.

The jump in price saw Ethereum finally beat the $1,300 price point after hovering around $1,200 coming out of the weekend. However, the digital asset had met significant resistance at the $1,350 price level, which could end up being a bearish development for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Aim Big After Recent Breakout Above $1,300 Ethereum Trades Are Wary Currently, Ethereum traders are still very on edge regarding the cryptocurrency. Even the Tuesday recovery has not done much to actually instill faith in buyers, especially given the Fed’s announcement that is expected to happen on Wednesday. Expectations remain narrow because even though inflation saw a slowdown, it still remains high at 7.1%. Given this, traders are still being conservative in their positions and are not placing too much emphasis on ETH at this time. This is expected to continue through much of the midweek trading day until Powell’s announcement is live. There are also expectations to follow depending on what stance the Fed takes this time around. Over the last couple of months, the Fed had been hawkish due to the rising inflation in the country. But given that inflation had actually come out lower this time around, it could see the Fed soften its stance. If not, then a continuous hawkish stance from the Fed would no doubt see a retracement in the crypto market, which could see Ethereum lose all of its gains from Tuesday. Binance FUD Affects ETH Over the last couple of days, the Binance crypto exchange had been the target to crypto users’ ire as questions about its reserves were raised. As a result, there was massive withdrawals from the exchange, with Binance Ethereum withdrawals accounting for the majority of ETH withdrawals from centralized exchanges over the past week. As it is now, there are still rumors that the exchange may be insolvent and some are beginning to prepare for another FTX-level event if Binance were to fall. Naturally, this has led to caution among investors who expect a downtrend if such a thing were to happen.

After FTX collapsed, users in the space began to question if exchanges actually held enough in their reserves to honor all customers. Given what happened to FTX, is it possible for Binance to come out of this unscathed? Related Reading: Why Goldman Sachs Expects This Asset Class To Outperform Bitcoin Binance Withdrawals Intensify As the FUD spread across social media platforms, Binance users had taken to withdrawing their deposits from the exchange en masse. Data aggregator platform reported on Tuesday that Binance’s withdrawals had crossed $1.9 billion, and by the end of the day, reports were that the withdrawals were eventually higher than $3 billion in a single day. According to the data released, the withdrawals were one of the highest single-day volume for the crypto exchange, which understandably had users at the edge of their seats. However, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao had come out to quell fears, explaining that it was nowhere near the highest single-day withdrawals the exchange had processed. Zhao explained that Binance had seen higher volumes when the LUNA cryptocurrency had collapsed, as well as during the FTX implosion. Most of the FUD had stemmed from the ‘audit’ report from Mazars which had drawn criticism from some experts in the industry. The multiple tweets saying that the Mazars report did not qualify as an audit had gained traction, leading to the current situation. Can The Crypto Exchange Survive? So far, Binance has been able to wade through the enormous FUD without much of a problem. Reports on social media say that despite the large withdrawal volumes, the crypto exchange continues to honor all of them in a timely manner. Also, data on Nansen show that deposits into the crypto exchange has been high during this time, offsetting the outflows to a significant degree. This tweet retweeted by “CZ” includes a screenshot of Nansen’s dashboard that showed Binance inflows were almost as high as outflows, resulting in negative net flows of only $378 million for the 24-hour period. CEO Zhao has referred to the current FUD as a “stress test” that “helps to build the credibility for exchanges that passes the test.” Haters: Omg omg!! #binance saw over 6 bn in withdrawals yesterday!!But these fudders did not tell that it got more deposits (6.56B) than withdrawals.

Most regulators say they can’t do the job without more powers from Congress. So far, a sound-and-fury campaign from lawmakers hasn’t shown a path forward.  Any path will almost certainly depend on Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who concluded an FTX hearing Wednesday with a pointed question:  “Do you think crypto platforms could mostly comply with actual regulations?” he asked of witness Hilary Allen, a professor at American University’s law school who is a critic of the digital assets industry.  “No, I don’t,” she said. “And I think when they’re calling for regulator clarity, what they’re asking for actually is bespoke regulation that they can comply with.”  “Good answer,” he said.  Brown and other lawmakers in the hearing settled into the lanes the parties have established in the wake of FTX: condemnation and suspicion of cryptocurrencies from Democrats, and an insistence from Republicans that the technology isn't to blame. But the hearing did little to signal what they might do about the industry next year, when crypto legislation is expected to really get rolling.  The chairman hinted that one priority may be going after the structure of the big crypto firms, which routinely combines exchange, lending, custody and investing functions all under the same roof in ways that would be outlawed in the more closely regulated U.S. financial industry.  “If we are going to learn from FTX’s meltdown, we must look closely at the risks from conflicts at crypto platforms that combine multiple functions,” Brown said. “We can look to existing banking and securities laws for time-tested approaches.”  FTX and Alameda Research, the trading firm also founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, commingled their funds and accounts, according to the criminal charges and the findings of FTX's current CEO, John Ray III.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still leading the way in crypto oversight via enforcement actions. On Tuesday the SEC accused FTX and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried of defrauding investors. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has insisted that his agency is fine moving ahead with the powers it already has to force digital assets companies to comply with securities regulations. He’s warned the industry the standoff between his agency and crypto firms is nearing its end.  But Brown and other regulators, such as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have argued the answer has to be a wider effort across the federal government. Such a legislative solution would likely involve debates in several committees next year and may take months to make significant progress.  Any action from the Democrat-controlled Senate will also have to mesh with the views of a Republican-controlled House of Representatives for at least the next two years. While the industry has enjoyed a period of some bipartisanship, the drama around FTX may have widened the rift a bit. Committee members such as Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) questioned whether establishing regulations would give the industry too much credibility.  The committee had initially meant to have Bankman-Fried testify, but he'd refused the invitation even before being arrested this week. The committee also didn't have CEO Ray, who appeared Tuesday before a House committee.  Instead, the Senate witness list included Kevin O’Leary, a former spokesman for FTX who said crypto's problems could be solved with regulation; Jennifer Schulp from the libertarian Cato Institute; and Ben McKenzie Schenkkan, a television actor who has written about crypto.  A number of Republican senators were no-shows at the FTX hearing, and the crypto views of Sen. Tim Scott, (R-S.C.), who is set to serve as the committee’s ranking Republican in the next congressional session, remain an open question. He’s replacing Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) in that role, and Toomey has been one of the industry’s most reliable defenders on Capitol Hill.  Toomey, who is retiring from the Senate in the next couple of weeks, said the actions inside FTX seem to have been illegal and Bankman-Fried’s arrest in the Bahamas was no surprise to anybody, “with the possible exception of Mr. Bankman-Fried.” But he argued against blaming digital assets.  “There’s nothing intrinsically good or evil about software,” he said. “FTX and cryptocurrencies are not the same thing.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/14/ftx-hearing-in-us-senate-reveals-congress-doesnt-have-immediate-answers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ccb3b08680f3464b857330a655be6778f9e40ba-8272x5515.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With a price increase of around 50% within the last seven days, the token is the undisputed leader, followed by Stacks (+16%) and Bitcoin SV (+14%). Over the last 24 hours, Toncoin is writing a whopping 21% gain. While it was trading at $1.86 on Sunday, the cryptocurrency was trading for $2.86 at press time. In the last 24 hours alone, the trading volume has skyrocketed 83%, to $95.4 million. On the daily chart, TON is thus approaching its all-time high of $3.26. A Reason For The Skyrocketing Price Of Toncoin The reason for the recent pump of the Toncoin could be a feature of Telegram, which was announced last week. Pavel Durov himself, the founder and head of the popular messenger, introduced a feature for Telegram that allows users to buy an anonymous phone number with the token and create an account with it.

It sells the anonymous numbers compatible only with Telegram. Purchases are transacted on the platform using The Open Network Telegram token.

The most popular number is +888 8 888, for which 38,290 TON, the equivalent of about $103,000, are currently being bid. The auction runs for a little more than six days. The Open Network is the brainchild of the Telegram development team, which was forced to abandon the blockchain solution due to pressure from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June 2020.

5598253,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4564509-problems-with-defi?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1671046737,The Problems With DeFi,"Summary An overview of some of the potential opportunities and shortfalls of ""Decentralized Finance"" or ""DeFi"" for short. Analysis on various centralization risks and other risk associated with DeFi. Examples of misaligned advertising and problematic details around the DeFi industry. In the wake of the FTX/Alameda (FTT-USD) collapse, which came after prior collapses of Luna (LUNC-USD), Celsius (CEL-USD), Voyager (VYGVQ), and Three Arrows Capital, many crypto industry analysts have pointed towards DeFi (“Decentralized Finance”) as a potential solution. This article dissects some of the nuances of that view, grants that certain opportunities exist, but offers a rather critical assessment of the current state of the industry overall. CeFi: The Problem Of Opaque Leverage The purported benefit of DeFi is that the technology can supposedly decentralize and add transparency to various trading and leveraging services. So, it makes sense to start this article by analyzing crypto CeFi (“centralized finance”) before getting into crypto DeFi (“decentralized finance”). In the crypto asset industry, the two big types of centralized companies are exchanges and deposit/lenders. The term “CeFi” mainly refers to the latter, but more broadly can include both, especially since the two business models can be intertwined. Exchanges allow traders to swap around various crypto assets, and generally offer leverage to traders as well. Deposit/lenders (aka “liquidity providers”) allow people to deposit crypto assets and collect a yield, allow people to deposit crypto assets as collateral to borrow stablecoins or fiat currency, and allow some institutions to borrow money in an uncollateralized way. There are other companies as well, such as pure custodians, technology developers, and so forth, but those are the two types of companies that are relevant for a comparison to DeFi. Large portions of the legacy financial system are opaque. It’s difficult to determine how much liabilities any given entity has, unless it’s publicly traded. Even then, it’s still possible to commit fraud or to obfuscate the details with certain accounting tricks to some degree. This tendency carried over into the CeFi crypto industry, but on steroids. Various trading firms and funds frequently take on leverage to speculate on crypto assets, and especially altcoins. Since very few of these companies are publicly-traded, almost all of it is rather opaque, even though it involves many billions of dollars. Throughout 2021 and 2022, this industry began to run into problems for the cycle. The early problems began with the premium-over-NAV of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( BTC )"" target=""_blank"">OTC:GBTC ) flipping to a discount-under-NAV. In other words, there was a time when the market price of the fund was a dollar forty for every dollar worth of Bitcoin in the fund, and now the market price is below sixty cents for every dollar worth of bitcoin in the fund. YCharts Many trading firms had leveraged exposure to that vehicle, so this was a bigger issue for them than one might realize. For years, GBTC was one of the few ways to get bitcoin exposure in the form of a security, which a number of regulated entities wanted. Therefore, it traded at a premium over net asset value “NAV”, since it offered something that was otherwise hard to get in that type of securitized package, including within a brokerage account. As more funds and securities came to market, offering bitcoin price exposure for these regulated types of entities, GBTC became less unique, and its premium went away. Most close-end funds trade at a mild discount to NAV, and GBTC became no different. The vast majority of my bitcoin exposure is directly in bitcoin itself. However, in my brokerage portfolios, I have used a small GBTC position to replicate bitcoin price exposure for lack of better alternatives. I have rebalanced its exposure from time to time, especially when its premium became excessive, like in this case with my No Limits portfolio: YCharts In addition to just being a way for a portfolio to get some bitcoin price exposure, GBTC also gave accredited investors an arbitrage trade for many years. They 1) could short bitcoin, and 2) send funds to GBTC to create new units of GBTC at NAV. They had to hold this position for a six-month lockup, and then could sell their GBTC shares for a premium over NAV and close their bitcoin shorts, thus pocketing that premium over NAV as a profit without exposing themselves to the volatile bitcoin price exposure that underlies both bitcoin itself and GBTC. Then, they could repeat this trade again and again. This worked for a long time, until it became easier to access bitcoin exposure in various other regulated vehicles. At that point, there was no longer reason for the trust to have a premium over NAV. This caught a number of trading firms off guard, since they were stuck with a massive bitcoin short position and a massive GBTC long position that, rather than trading at a premium as it used to, was now at a discount. In other words, they experienced a major loss from what they viewed as a low-risk trade, and that they therefore had on in size and with leverage. So, that was strike one. I covered this premium-to-discount flip back in one of my premium reports at the time, although I mainly focused on it as a cessation of a portion of the buying pressure on bitcoin: Up against the structural bull market of the post-halving adoption cycle, there are two fundamental headwinds against bitcoin at the moment. The first is potentially bond yields as described previously. If they keep rising, and the dollar index remains firm, and liquidity gets more tight, that should continue to pressure highly-valued growth stocks, and bitcoin may temporarily be lumped into that category by investors as well, especially in a broad risk-off environment. The second is that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust no longer has a positive premium over its net asset value or “NAV”. In fact, it’s trading at a slight discount to NAV. Canada now has a solid bitcoin ETF, firms such as NYDIG and SkyBridge have come to market over time and provided competition for institutional and accredited investor allocations into bitcoin. So, there is less of a reason for GBTC to have a premium. Most existing closed end funds for other asset classes trade at a discount to NAV, and GBTC has at least temporarily joined the discount club. This discount to NAV is both good and bad. It’s good because it makes GBTC a better vehicle for holding bitcoin than it used to be, since you’re getting it at around net asset value rather than at a premium. It’s bad because it removes one of the sources of bitcoin demand. GBTC was the biggest buyer of bitcoin in 2020. Some of this was for long exposure, and another big chunk was for market-neutral arbitrage. For that second part, accredited investors and institutions could buy into GBTC at NAV with a six-month lock-up period, and then sell six months later at the market price, and that market price generally had a premium over NAV. Simultaneously with their purchase at NAV, they could short bitcoin elsewhere, and thus make a non-directional investment that simply lets them extract the premium over NAV every six months with no exposure to bitcoin’s price. This process made a lot of money for folks, and permanently sucked up a lot of bitcoin. GBTC basically converted liquid bitcoin to illiquid bitcoin, locked away in cold storage. If the GBTC premium remains minimal or negative, that trade is done, and thus that specific source of demand and liquid-to-illiquid conversion process is done. -Lyn Alden, February 28th 2021 Stock Waves report Strike two was when Terra/Luna blew up, and that was basically a ponzi scheme from the start. The people involved lured retail investors in with artificial unsustainable 20% yields. I warned about Terra/Luna during April and May 2022 near its highs, and then wrote a post-mortem on it called “ Digital Alchemy ” in May 2022. One of the themes of that post-mortem is that when liquidity and general business conditions are improving, crypto ponzis tend to be built, and when liquidity and general business conditions are deteriorating, crypto ponzis tend to be revealed and break apart: Trading Economics, annotated by Lyn Alden A number of leveraged trading firms had exposure to Luna, which made the subsequent blow-up in the crypto industry even more severe than I would have guessed at the time. The biggest surprise to many was the fall of Three Arrows Capital or “3AC” for short, which had been impaired by the GBTC discount and then was hit again by the collapse of Luna, which the 3AC team had been particularly bullish on. Three Arrows Capital was a large crypto trading firm that had been around for ten years, and they were using a lot more leverage than most people realized, since it was opaque and they were quietly borrowing from many different sources that were not necessarily communicating with each other. Multiple lenders including Voyager and Genesis had huge unsecured loans out to 3AC. BlockFi had a huge loan to 3AC as well, but it was collateralized, which reduced the total impact to themselves. Celsius and a couple dozen other firms also had loans out to 3AC. So, the resulting implosion of 3AC brought down large swaths of the crypto lending industry, with just a handful still standing afterward. The overall risk management in the space was bad, although some were better than others. Many of the lenders were lending to just a handful of the same massive borrowers, like 3AC. Overall, the biggest losses in the CeFi industry came from either 1) making uncollateralized loans to leveraged entities with opaque balance sheets or 2) custodying assets with leveraged entities with opaque balance sheets. And the problem with opaque balance sheets, of course, is that it’s hard to know for sure how much they are leveraged, especially when there is allegedly outright fraud involved in some cases. What DeFi Aims To Accomplish In contrast to CeFi, trading and leveraging occurs on various blockchains as well, in what is generally termed “DeFi”. As previously mentioned, this stands for “decentralized finance”. The foundation for this activity consists of Layer 1 smart contract blockchains, such as Ethereum (ETH-USD) , BNB Chain (BNB-USD), Positron (TRON-USD), Avalanche (AVAX-USD), Solana (SOL-USD), and others. These systems allow a computing environment to be embedded into a blockchain. This effectively becomes a federated computing environment, meaning a computing environment that is spread across multiple machines, and thus able to be observed and confirmed by multiple different entities. This computing environment can also be built on layers/sidechains on top of other blockchains like the Bitcoin network (e.g. Liquid or RSK), but most of the activity thus far has been on these Layer 1 smart contract blockchains. After the computing layer, the next layer up consists of two main parts: decentralized exchanges and decentralized deposit/lenders. The decentralized exchanges allow traders to swap in and out of various crypto assets, similarly to how they would on a centralized exchange. The decentralized deposit/lenders (the most common term being “liquidity providers”) allow users to either 1) deposit crypto assets into the protocol to receive a yield or 2) deposit crypto assets as collateral to borrow another type of crypto asset, with the most common asset on the deposit and the borrowing side being stablecoins. Whether or not these are actually as decentralized as they claim to be will be discussed in a later section of this article. After that, there are other types of DeFi assets. Most of these are equity/governance tokens associated with controlling and potentially earning profits from those exchange protocols and deposit/lender protocols. However, there are a lot of questions around what any of this means in the long run. Here are some examples of things that can happen with DeFi: Person A has a bunch of bitcoin, transfers it into Wrapped Bitcoin (“WBTC”), and so now it’s a custodial bearer asset that is tradeable on the Ethereum network. They then deposit that WBTC as collateral on Aave (AAVE-USD) (a borrower/lender protocol) to borrow stablecoins. They send some of those stablecoins back to a centralized exchange and sell them for normal fiat currency, which they withdraw to their bank to use for daily spending. They now have leveraged bitcoin, with multiple layers of counterparty risk to hacks and custodian problems, and as well as a chance of liquidation if the price of bitcoin goes too low. Person B has a bunch of ether, and deposits it as collateral into Aave to borrow a bunch of stablecoins. They then trade those stablecoins on a decentralized exchange called Uniswap (UNI-USD) for some DeFi equity/governance tokens (let’s say AAVE and COMP) as well as UNI, which is the coin associated with that same decentralized exchange. So they have leveraged ether as collateral to buy a bunch of DeFi protocol equity/governance tokens (AAVE, COMP, UNI). Person C doesn’t own much crypto assets, but decides to convert some fiat currency into stablecoins, and deposit those stablecoins into Aave and Compound to earn a yield. In this sense, they are funding the collateralized loans to Person A and Person B. Until the Federal Reserve increased interest rates this year, these stablecoin deposits earned much higher yields than they would get with a safer FDIC-insured bank deposit or a Treasury bill, albeit with much higher risk, and so this usage of capital kind of competed with junk bonds or similar ways to earn a high yield in traditional markets. If this all sounds familiar, here is what I wrote back in January 2021: One of my concerns, when reviewing the biggest use cases for decentralized apps, is that a lot of the use-case is circular and speculative. Ethereum is heavily used for decentralized exchanges of crypto tokens, crypto stablecoins that serve as liquid units of account for trading crypto tokens, and lending and earning interest on crypto tokens which is a practice that serves as a liquidity/borrowing source for traders of crypto tokens. To a lesser extent, it is also used for gamified ways to earn or trade various crypto tokens. So, it’s a big operating system powered by crypto tokens, for the purpose of moving around… crypto tokens. A healthy banking system in the real world would consist of people depositing money, and the banks making various loans for mortgages and for business financing, to generate real-world utility. A speculation-based banking system, on the other hand, would consist of a bunch of banks taking deposit money, and then lending to speculators in the nearby stock market, along with technology providers that make this easier, and then what those speculators are trading mostly consists of shares of those banks, shares of those tech companies, and shares of the stock exchange, resulting in a big circular speculative party. The biggest use case so far for Ethereum is a decentralized version of that circular speculation-based system. –Lyn Alden, An Economic Analysis of Ethereum , January 2021 When we look back almost two years later from my January 2021 piece that initially covered this industry, I can’t really say that it’s any different. It has been a circular and speculative party with little or no real-world utility the entire time, and the industry has made little if any improvement on that front. In fact, a March 2022 study found that 97.7% of the coins traded on Uniswap were rug-pulls. A rug-pull is when developers and investors hype up a project, extract value from it as investor money pours in, and have no intention to actually execute on their plans. The Ever-Present Risk Of DeFi Exploits DeFi offers some benefits of transparency, but it also offers a huge attack surface for hackers/exploiters. These are commonly referred to as “DeFi hacks”, where someone figures out how to steal funds from a smart contract. In reality, it’s better to think of them as exploits or arbitrage opportunities than hacks. “Code is law” was a common adage in the early days of DeFi (and of course, stretching back prior to DeFi). If there’s a bug in a smart contract, then someone can exploit it and potentially give themselves an advantage, up to and including taking assets in a way that the contract did not intend. This is similar to a poorly-written real-world contract, where a clever lawyer can find loopholes and help a client to abuse a contract in a way that was not intended when it was written. After all, if code is not the final arbiter of a smart contract, then what is the point of a smart contract? The Bitcoin network is the most streamlined blockchain, with nearly 14 years of operating history. It’s purposely simple, purposely changes very slowly, and is purposely resistant to change except in the case of overwhelming consensus. Despite all of that, the Bitcoin network has still encountered a number of serious bugs over the years. So, what hope do ever-changing and highly complex smart contracts have? Anyone who holds funds in DeFi or other smart contracts should assume that there is an ever-present risk of code exploits and loss of funds. You’re getting a 3% yield? Great. Weigh that against the probability of a 100% loss occurring at any point over the year, and then repeat that year after year. The risk is amplified when smart contracts from different blockchains or different layers interact with each other. More than two and a half billion dollars worth of crypto assets have been exploited from smart contracts over the past two and a half years: The Block Collateralized Vs Uncollateralized: That’s The Key Many DeFi proponents point to the fact that most CeFi lenders failed in 2022 while DeFi contracts continue to operate. While there is a grain of truth to that, we should examine the underlying reason: collateralization. CeFi lenders that made fully-collateralized loans generally held up well also. If they had to liquidate a client, it was the client that was ruined rather than the lender. The trouble occurred as CeFi lenders made under-collateralized or non-collateralized loans to entities that they thought were trustworthy (who then went and gambled it away in DeFi, such as on LUNA tokens, and were unable to pay back the loans). Due to DeFi’s automated nature, it’s very hard to do it in a way that makes sense without over-collateralization. So, by its very nature, DeFi consists of mostly over-collateralized leverage. The lesson here is not that DeFi is better than CeFi; it’s that when it comes to volatile assets in particular, over-collateralized loans are safer than under-collateralized or non-collateralized loans. In a DeFi environment, a depositor mainly has exposure to collateralized lending (a good thing, as far as lending is concerned), but also faces constant smart contract exploit risk (a bad thing). In a CeFi environment, a depositor may have a exposure to some blend of collateralized and non-collateralized lending (a bad thing), but has greater protection from exploits (a good thing). My takeaway from the crypto industry events of 2022 is not that DeFi is better than CeFi. Instead, my takeaway is that with these highly volatile assets, chasing yield is inherently unwise . And to the extent that cautious lending is done, it should mainly be over-collateralized lending. Bitcoin offers the user the ability to self-custody their own units of a finite liquid asset, and to send or receive permissionless payments with that asset, without relying on a centralized third party. In my view, that’s the signal through the noise, and that’s more powerful than many people yet realize. Intermediate-term usage of stablecoins for savings and payments in developing countries, where accessing dollars is difficult, is another good utility use-case. They should be aware of counterparty risks, and overall I’d like to see greater and greater transparency of stablecoin collateral. Almost everything else involves speculating, or involves picking up nickels (yield) in front of a steamroller (opaque counterparty risks and/or code exploits). The fact that I dabbled in yield-seeking for a year, even with a small amount of capital, and even though I stopped well before the blow-ups happened, is something that I consider to have been an error when navigating through this industry. The Centralized Shortcomings Of DeFi Aside from the circular, speculative, and sometimes outright fraudulent nature of the crypto industry including the DeFi sub-industry, there are centralization problems at the heart of the technology, even though it is marketed as being decentralized. Centralized Smart Contract Blockchains The foundation of the DeFi tech stack, the underlying smart contract blockchains, already start with some centralized aspects compared to the more decentralized Bitcoin network. For example, the Ethereum network had difficulty bombs in the code for over seven years from its inception in 2015 until its proof-of-stake conversion in 2022. This reduced the power of miners and individual node operators, and enhanced the power of the head developers, which is a form of centralization. It allows them to push through a roadmap and change the protocol according to their vision, which basically makes it an investment contract. Even after the proof-of-stake conversion here in 2022, users of the network still have to wait for developers to implement staking withdrawals. Binance, meanwhile, can pretty much ask the Binance Smart Chain to pause if there is a problem, like it did between October 6th and 7th of this year . The Binance chain in theory is a separate and decentralized system from Binance the centralized company, but in reality: CZ, Binance CEO, via Twitter Similarly, when Solana unexpectedly went offline on five separate occasions in 2022, the validator operators had to meet via Discord to manually restart the chain. Many proof-of-stake chains operate like this. The technical or capital requirements to be a validator are quite high, which ends up making the operation of the system rather oligopolistic. And unlike proof-of-work protocols, proof-of-stake protocols have no unforgeable history of the ledger, and so if the system intentionally or unintentionally goes offline, it’s a rather manual process to determine where the appropriate checkpoint is and where to restart the network from. Since it is costless to create a nearly unlimited number of alternative histories, each seemingly as valid as the next, there is no unforgeable, self-verifiable way to determine what the “true” history of the ledger is in a proof-of-stake system (that’s what proof-of-work does specifically), and so with proof-of-stake checkpointing, some authority or set of authorities needs to be trusted. That’s why there are projects like Babylon Chain that allow proof-of-stake chains to insert unforgeable timestamps into the Bitcoin blockchain. It’s an attempt to mitigate some of the inherent circular problems with proof-of-stake systems by making use of the dominant proof-of-work system. They use the Bitcoin network as the checkpointing authority. In addition to centralized difficulty bombs, centralized developer decisions, centralized validation, and/or the centralized checkpointing authority problem, there’s also the simple problem that in most cases, the smart contract blockchain nodes are too big. Optimal blockchain privacy and decentralization occurs when a user runs their own node, or at least has the practical option to if they should need to. This allows them to verify aspects of the network for themselves, and allows them to initiate transactions themselves rather than asking a third party to initiate a transaction for them. However, by adding higher throughput or more code expressivity right on the base layer of the protocol, it increases the processing, storage, and bandwidth requirements of running a node. In order to run a Solana or Binance node, you pretty much need enterprise-grade equipment or use a cloud provider, for example. Ethereum nodes are lighter than nodes for Solana or Binance, but are still too bulky to run over Tor. According to ethernodes.org , there are only around 6,700 Ethereum nodes. Of those, over 4,400 are hosted by a provider (generally a cloud service), including 2,700 that are hosted via Amazon specifically. There are only around 2,300 non-hosted nodes. Most users and apps instead rely on third-party node operators like Infura and Alchemy (which themselves make heavy use of cloud providers). When the US Treasury Department sanctioned the privacy-focused smart contract Tornado Cash in August 2022, Infura and Alchemy complied, and ceased processing transactions related to Tornado Cash. This means that many foreign people, including those who aren’t even subject to US sanctions, can’t use Tornado Cash unless they are willing to run their own Ethereum node, which is nontrivial to do and can’t be run over Tor. In contrast to all of this, back when Satoshi Nakamoto invented bitcoin, he purposely made sacrifices in terms of bandwidth and complexity to make it as small and simple and decentralized as possible. This made it possible for individual users to run bitcoin nodes comfortably on a laptop with a normal internet connection. The requirements to run a node expand more slowly than technological improvements in processing, storage, and internet bandwidth, so it directionally becomes easier to run a bitcoin node over time rather than harder. The goal of the Bitcoin network from inception was to cut out all of the unnecessary fat to keep it as lightweight as possible. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own. -Satoshi Nakamoto, November 2008 Centralized Custodial Assets Aside from some of the centralization aspects on the underlying smart contract blockchains that the DeFi industry relies on, the actual DeFi use-cases tend to have even more reliance on centralized entities. The vast majority of DeFi total locked value relies on centralized custodial stablecoins and other centralized custodial assets. Stablecoins make up a large portion of the lending and borrowing in the pseudo-decentralized deposit/lending protocols, and stablecoins are common trading pairs in the pseudo-decentralized exchanges. A fiat-collateralized stablecoin, such as USDT or USDC, is one where a centralized issuer holds assets in the form of bank deposits, Treasury bills, repurchase agreements, commercial paper, or similar types of assets, and issues redeemable token liabilities that are tradeable on a blockchain. In other words, there is a centralized issuer that manages the collateral and processes redemptions, but the liabilities are digital bearer assets for the holders, and thus can be traded between people efficiently and automatically with no further action needed by the centralized issuer. The centralized issuer can, however, still choose to actively freeze specific addresses as requested by law enforcement or due to various code exploits. In addition to the heavy reliance on centralized custodial stablecoins, DeFi on Ethereum makes heavy use of Wrapped Bitcoin “WBTC”. This is a custodial product whereby bitcoin is held in custody, and its token liabilities can be leveraged or traded on the Ethereum blockchain. The amount of custodial bitcoin wrapped on Ethereum rivals the amount of custodial bitcoin held by the largest crypto exchanges. Much like stablecoins, this is a centralized product whose liabilities are bearer assets. The worst-case scenario for how this could play out on Ethereum, has already played out on Solana. There are tokens on Solana representing wrapped bitcoin and wrapped ether, to allow those assets to be leveraged or traded within the Solana ecosystem. The problem, however, is that FTX was the issuer of those assets, and FTX is now bankrupt. As a result, those custodial assets de-pegged and lost almost all of their value: Coin Gecko Attempts At Synthetic Stablecoins Some stablecoin developers have tried to get around this reliance on centralized issuers and custodians. After all, if most of the value of the assets traded on “decentralized finance” protocols are themselves completely centralized, then is that term even appropriate? Just because the liabilities of a centralized entity are bearer asset tokens, doesn’t make the system decentralized. MakerDAO, for example introduced DAI several years ago, which began as an ether-collateralized synthetic stablecoin. What this means is that rather than being redeemable for actual dollars like USDT or USDC are, DAI is backed by an over-collateralized amount of ether and balanced with a stabilization algorithm, to synthetically represent one dollar. Fiat currencies are centrally-managed ledgers. Trying to peg a pseudo-decentralized ledger (e.g. a crypto-collateralized stablecoin protocol) to an actively-managed and centralized ledger (e.g. the Federal Reserve system) is always going to come with various limitations and risks. In this case, using a volatile asset as collateral means that there is a reasonably high chance of sudden liquidation of that collateral. Sudden liquidations are likely to occur during tumultuous market periods, which leads to chain congestion and extremely high transaction fees as too many people scramble for the exit at once, and too many liquidations are triggered at once, for the network to handle properly. In March 2020, during the global market crash associated with COVID-19 becoming a pandemic and various economies locking down, the price of ether crashed, and in an emergency situation, MakerDAO ironically voted to add centralized USDC fiat-collateralized stablecoins as a form of DAI collateral. This is because a crypto-collateralized stablecoin (which is basically the attempt to back a low-volatility asset with a high-volatility asset) is inherently either fragile or capital inefficient. Ever since then, USDC has been a very large percentage of DAI’s collateral. USDC could freeze DAI’s collateral and basically end that project at any time, if asked to by the government. In order to have an arbitrarily low probability of liquidation, a crypto-collateralized stablecoin requires an arbitrarily high ratio of over-collateralization. In simplistic terms, if you want the stablecoin to avoid having to liquidate even with a 75% drawdown of the collateral, then you need 4-to-1 overcollateralization. If you want the stablecoin to avoid having to liquidate even with a 90% drawdown of the collateral, you need 10-to-1 overcollateralization. This would be extremely capital inefficient if handled that way, and therefore most protocols will try to get around these levels by relying on incentive mechanisms to bring in more collateral from the community when it is needed, rather than keeping it there all the time. For example, newer crypto-collateralized stablecoins like Liquity and Zero aim to be 100% crypto-collateralized via incentive mechanisms. Liquity (LUSD-USD) is collateralized by ether, and Zero (ZUSD-USD) is a fork of it on the RSK sidechain of the Bitcoin network that is collateralized by RBTC, which is RSK’s merge-mined federation-wrapped version of bitcoin. The way this works for Zero is that ZUSD synthetic stablecoins can be created when someone deposits RBTC into the smart contract as collateral and receives ZUSD as a loan on their collateral. If they get liquidated (which occurs if the value of the RBTC falls below the maintenance threshold on the contract), they lose their RBTC but keep the ZUSD. The system overall optimizes towards a 1.5x or higher level of system-wide overcollateralization, although individual loans can be as low as 1.1x overcollateralized. If the system as a whole reaches sub-1.5x levels of collateralization, it liquidates loans under 1.5x levels of collateralization and changes the incentive mechanisms for borrowing to encourage higher levels of collateralization. Importantly, there is a stability pool that incentivizes holders of ZUSD to deposit and support the lending. If loans get liquidated, these ZUSD depositors get their funds transformed into RBTC at a discount to the market price of RBTC (which is conceptually kind of like selling put options to wait and buy RBTC at a discount, since most of these participants would generally be bullish on RBTC). So, the system encourages excess ZUSD that is floating around in the market, to come back and get burned in exchange for the ZUSD holders receiving RBTC, to reduce the chances that the dollar amount of ZUSD is ever not fully backed by a greater dollar amount of RBTC. These incentive mechanisms are interesting. LUSD, with its longer history than ZUSD (and that ZUSD is based on) has managed to maintain its USD peg throughout the 2021 and 2022 bear markets, where ether (the collateral for LUSD) was at one point down by around 80% from its high. Here is a post from May 2021 analyzing how it held up well in an ether flash-crash scenario, thanks to a properly-working oracle and a properly-working stability pool. However, it has been less than two years of operation overall, and LUSD is tiny compared to fiat-collateralized stablecoins like USDT and USDC, meaning that DeFi as a whole is still incredibly reliant on custodial assets. I view bitcoin as being better collateral than ether, all else being equal, and so I naturally would prefer DeFi on the Bitcoin network, at least to the extent that I would be interested in DeFi to any meaningful degree. I don’t plan to leverage any of my bitcoin, and I’m happy to hold bank dollars, money markets, or T-bills to the extent that I want liquid dollar exposure, so I’m not exactly the target audience here. Ongoing holders of LUSD and ZUSD have to trust 1) that the underlying smart contracts won’t be exploited for the foreseeable future, 2) that the incentive mechanisms will continue to work for the foreseeable future to properly maintain over-collateralization through all market conditions, 3) that the price oracles won’t be gamed in any destabilizing way, and 4) that the governance of the smart contract won’t become misaligned with users or otherwise captured (referring either to the specific contract governance or the underlying computational layer governance). Centralized Oracles Tying digital assets to real-world information involves a centralized oracle, or a quorum of several centralized oracles to try to spread out the oracle readings. An oracle is a source of information that a smart contract requires in order to execute its function. For example, tying a crypto asset to the dollar means that the smart contract needs to know what the dollar-denominated price of that crypto asset is, which means it needs information from an exchange. Similarly, a sports betting smart contract needs an external source of truth that collects the information from the real-world sports game, so that the smart contract can award the gains to the winning speculators. This reliance on one or more oracles represents yet another point of centralization. Who controls the oracle or oracles? How easy is it to manipulate a given oracle or set of oracles and exploit a contract? Centralized Governance Actions Many deposit/lender protocols and exchange protocols have centralized web-based user interfaces, and centralized companies supporting them. The underlying technology may be open source and accessible without them (requiring the user to run a node, or otherwise be rather hands-on technically), but for most users, that web-based user interface is how they access the services. There have already been precedents for these centralized companies and interfaces removing certain tokens from their trading or leveraging environments, either when asked to by a government or pre-emptively to try to avoid breaking securities laws. And many of these systems have far more centralized control than they let on. For example, as Jameson Lopp pointed out earlier this month, the DeFi protocol called Serum on the Solana blockchain markets itself as fully decentralized in its Twitter bio and elsewhere, and yet right under its bio there is a pinned tweet about how it went defunct due to centralized control. This is what you see when you look at their Twitter bio as of this writing: Project Serium, via Twitter How can something be considered “fully decentralized” if one centralized entity holds the upgrade authority? Many of these protocols try to to answer that question by breaking up control of the service by using governance tokens. Either from an initial coin offering or from airdrops to users, these tokens can be distributed, and allow for voting on various governance actions that relate to the operation of the service. These same tokens may also earn a share of profits generated by the protocol. While this is interesting in theory, it begins with several problems. First, as with most things in crypto, the vast majority of governance tokens are held by whales, meaning that a small number of wealthy entities retain the controlling share of voting power. Second, voter turnout tends to be low, which gives highly active and incentivized parties even greater control over the protocol’s governance in practice. Third, because it is pseudonymous, these governance models tend to be more easily gameable than real-world democracies. Pay-for-votes, entities secretly controlling a larger total share of the governance than the market realizes, and other problems make it hard to operate in a truly decentralized way. The co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, recently brought up the economic problems associated with governance tokens, and I agree with him: Vitalik Buterin, via Twitter So, recurring profits may be able to support token value (e.g. an equity security in digital form), but governance alone is an insufficient reason for a token to hold sustained value. And regardless of whether they earn profits or not, they’re likely going to be rather centrally-held and controlled in practice. Overall, there is a high probability that DeFi protocols will face greater scrutiny and regulation over time. And because they have so many centralized attack surfaces, it’s not that hard for regulators to clamp down on them, reduce their usability, and increase their trackability. When it comes to the DeFi ecosystem, their blockchain nodes mainly run on centralized cloud providers, most of their locked value relies heavily on centralized custodians, and users primarily interact with the ecosystem through centralized web interfaces maintained by centralized companies. DeFi Doesn’t Solve The Fiat Onramp Bottleneck One of the criticisms that people in the DeFi industry tend to aim at bitcoin, is that bitcoin is heavily reliant on centralized exchanges and brokers. The vast majority of its buying and selling occurs in centralized exchanges or through centralized brokers. “That’s why we need DeFi,” many of them say. However, we need to conceptually separate the phases of 1) post-onramp speculation/trading vs 2) actual onramping and utility. If you want to trade in DeFi, how do you start? Do you magically teleport your capital into a DeFi ecosystem? No. First, you go through a fiat onramp exchange, like Coinbase or Kraken, by transferring money from your bank to the exchange. Or you go through some other centralized payment provider. Then, you can buy various crypto assets, and move those crypto assets into a DeFi environment. From there, you can trade and leverage those crypto assets across various smart contracts. So, DeFi isn’t cutting out the bottleneck of relying on centralized exchanges or centralized bank connections for the fiat onramp part of the process. DeFi merely offers post-onramp smart contract environments to trade or leverage crypto assets, as a competitor to the alternative of remaining on those exchanges to trade and leverage crypto assets there. But realistically, how many people should be trading or leveraging crypto assets anyway? These aren’t “banking” services; these services are mainly for speculators. The Bitcoin network, on the other hand, has a similar onramp bottleneck. You send money to an exchange or broker, buy bitcoin, and then from there you can withdraw your bitcoin from the exchange or broker. From that point, you are financially “self-sovereign”, meaning you can self-custody your own bitcoin, and use the decentralized network to send or receive permissionless bitcoin payments globally. Additionally, there are some multi-signature escrow services that you can use, if for some reason you want to get a loan (in fiat or in stablecoins) while using your bitcoin as collateral. The only way to go around the onramp bottleneck, should centralized exchanges ever all be shut out from the banking system, is peer-to-peer purchases. In addition to mining, that’s how people got into bitcoin in the beginning, before exchanges existed. There are now methods like Bisq or RoboSats or Hodl Hodl or Paxful or Azteco for people that want to buy bitcoin without going through a centralized exchange, and sometimes with anonymity. The downside is that there is limited liquidity; these types of services only work for buying or selling modest amounts of bitcoin. However, the number and size of these types of services would likely substantially increase if centralized exchanges are shut out from the banking system. As a tangible example, Nigeria shut out crypto assets from its banking system nearly two years ago. Nigerian banks are disallowed from letting customers send money to crypto exchanges. And yet, Nigeria has among the highest bitcoin/crypto adoption in the world on a per-capita basis, and bitcoin/crypto in the country has much higher adoption than the country’s central bank digital currency, the eNaira. How is this possible? Because they use various peer-to-peer methods to acquire bitcoin. They can even do remote work such as programming or graphic design, and get paid by foreign clients in bitcoin straight to their own self-custody, which they can then use for global payments. Where there’s a will, there’s a way. And when official consumer prices in aggregate have gone up about 5x since 2010 due to ever-expanding money supply, and when authorities have arbitrary power to freeze bank accounts of protestors, there’s certainly a will. Trading Economics The “killer app” of bitcoin is simply using it for what it was originally designed to do: self-custodying and sending/receiving permissionless payments in what has thus far been the most decentralized, secure, and immutable crypto asset. Trading/leveraging is something that a subset of bitcoin holders may choose to do, but it’s not as though the world is in desperate need for more ways to speculate on ten thousand crypto assets, especially when DeFi is only relevant post-onramp and has nothing to do with the on-ramping process from the existing fiat banking system. Summary Points In summary, DeFi environments are trying to address a genuine trading/leveraging problem, but generally consist of multiple layers of partial centralization. -The underlying smart contract computational layer is often not as decentralized as it claims to be, thanks to validator oligopolies or developer control, the reliance on a checkpointing authority due to there not being an unforgeable history of the ledger, and the general difficulty in the ability of users to run a node due to high bandwidth and storage requirements. -Any significant trade-able asset that refers to some external data, such as price or some real-world connection, requires some centralized or partially-centralized custodian or oracle. -Governance in practice, even for purely digital assets, often is centralized and can be traced back to a centralized business entity or small group of individuals. -Any potential areas of actual decentralization in leveraging/trading protocols that may occur in this industry only apply once the speculator gets past the fiat onboarding bottleneck anyway; DeFi doesn’t solve the fiat onboarding bottleneck.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4564509-problems-with-defi?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5598253.jpeg

42388275,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRCVgz,1671045272,"Crypto Lending Platform Maple Finance Unveils Major Overhaul, Stops Lending on Solana","Blockchain-based lending platform Maple Finance unveiled Wednesday a major protocol overhaul in an attempt to improve on shortcomings highlighted by a spate of recent loan defaults.  Maple is a credit marketplace where institutional borrowers can take out undercollateralized loans from credit pools and investors can provide liquidity to earn a yield on deposits. Each credit pool has a delegate, a financial firm that underwrites the loans and runs due diligence on borrowers.  According to Maple’s blog post, the upgraded version, called Maple 2.0, includes improvements on the withdrawal request process, introducing an option to schedule and prorate withdrawals.  It also eliminates the lockup period on new deposits, which previously led to smart contract auditing platform Sherlock losing $4 million.  MPL is up 6.9% in the past 24 hours on the news, per data by price tracking site CoinGecko, outperforming the wider crypto markets. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is up 1.15%.  The new version features an overhauled protection mechanism called “first-loss capital” for lenders, which ostensibly absorbs some losses when a loan defaults. Now, only pool delegates provide funds to the default protection and can only be denominated in the same asset as are in the credit pool.  This move essentially eliminated staking MPL, Maple’s governance token, in the default protection fund, which was a popular yield-earning strategy for some investors.  In a previous iteration, assets in the default protection fund were a combination of USDC stablecoin and MPL tokens, and investors could stake their MPL tokens to earn rewards for contributing to the first-loss capital. In practice, stakers withdrew and dumped MPL when a default was looming, resulting in depleted funds to absorb losses.  “Good design updates,” Walter Teng, vice president of digital assets for research firm Fundstrat, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  However, eliminating MPL from the pool cover and halting staking may seriously reduce utility of the protocol’s native token, he added.  Over the past month, MPL token’s price plummeted 52%.  MPL staking rewards have been halted “due to subdued revenues, volatile market and the need to strengthen Maple fundamentals,” according to a spokesperson’s post on Maple’s Discord server.  The upgrade attempts to patch Maple’s protocol design flaws as it is grappling with its largest debt crisis in its 18-month history. The protocol accrued $54 million of distressed debt in the last two weeks as two of its borrowers, Auros Global and Orthogonal Trading became insolvent due to the implosion of FTX, the recently arrested Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange. Maple liquidity providers now face steep losses on their deposits while MPL fell to an all-time low.  Read more: Maple Finance's $54M of Sour Debt Shows Risks of Crypto Lending Without Collateral  Major blow to Solana  Along with the upgrade, Maple made a ""strategic decision"" to double down on using the Ethereum blockchain and discontinue lending on the Solana blockchain, according to a blog post.  ""By making improvements to the Maple Ethereum app as well as Ethereum’s move to [proof-of-stake], we are confident that frictions on Ethereum will no longer be prohibitive to current and prospective users of the Maple protocol,"" Maple said.  Maple introduced lending on the Solana blockchain in April with ambitious plans to grow credit pools to $300 million by the end of 2022.  The move represents a symbolic blow to Solana's reputation as a challenger blockchain to Ethereum after the FTX blowup.

42388411,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRG9GT,1671044710,Bitcoin Falls as Federal Reserve Slows Rate Hikes but Stays Hawkish,"The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point) as it continues to slow the economy and moderate price increases.  The decision brings the federal funds target range to 4.25%-4.5%, the highest level in 15 years. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the terminal rate – the peak rate for the current hiking cycle, expected sometime next year – will likely be over 5%.  Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped by 2.5% since the 2 p.m. ET (19:00 UTC) decision, to around $17,740.  Wednesday’s rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed’s monetary policy panel, signals a slowdown in the pace of hikes by the Fed, which for the past four consecutive meetings has raised rates in 75 basis point increments.  “50 basis points is still a historically large increase and we still have some ways to go,” Powell said at a press conference following the FOMC statement.  Inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) continues to slow on a yearly basis: November’s CPI report showed that inflation rose 7.1%, down from 7.7% in October, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.  Officials with the U.S. central bank had said over the past month that it might be appropriate to slow the pace of interest rate hikes while the economy adjusts to the higher level of borrowing costs. However, ""ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate,"" according to the FOMC statement.  New set of economic projections  The FOMC also released a new set of economic projections (SEP) and “dot plot,” representing top Fed officials' projections for the next year. Ten out of 19 central bankers who are part of the committee expect the terminal rate to be higher than 5% but lower than 5.25% by the end of 2023, the dot plot shows.  For 2024, the majority of dots were put in the range of 4% to 4.25%, suggesting that rates will continue to stay elevated for a while.  “The most important decision is no longer the speed,” Powell said, but rather for how long the Fed needs to stay restrictive until inflation comes down significantly, which he said will “be some time.”  “It’s our judgment today that we’re not at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance yet,” he said.

42407234,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJsPm,1671044155,"After FTX, Let's Get Back to Hiring Crypto People for the Job","In the early years, people left Wall Street for crypto because they believed in the future of this industry. It was fundamentally different from traditional finance. Then somewhere during the last bull run, the calculus changed. We started filtering candidates not on their crypto chops, but based on who went to Harvard or MIT or had high-pedigree parents.  One of the first questions when you meet someone new used to be, “How did you get into crypto?” and the response would usually start with the year, followed by why they left corporate America to work at a startup for half the pay of Wall Street.  Jenna Pilgrim is the managing partner of Mayflower Capital, a firm building teams in cryptocurrency and Web3. She has been building teams in the cryptocurrency industry since 2015, with tenures at the Blockchain Research Institute, Bloq and Streambed Media. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.  Somewhere in the bull markets, we forgot this first-principle-based approach. We started filtering candidates based on their successes in Web 2 or traditional finance (TradFi), thinking they could easily learn the lingo of crypto enough to get by. We brought traders from Wall Street and entrusted them with huge books of tokens, assuming it would be the same. Derivatives are derivatives, right?  I keep asking myself how the hell we allowed Sam Bankman-Fried and his band of new-coiners to get as big as they did without sharing our same set of shared values. I’ve resolved that it comes down to a failure of contextual understanding of where we have been, and where we as an industry would like to go.  Ideology matters  If you build a company with a CEO who only cares about making as much money as possible at any cost, you’ll attract talent who think the same. If you build a company that doesn’t care about privacy or decentralization, guess what? Your teams won’t care about that either. One largely overlooked feature of the FTX debacle is their diversion – and in some cases complete rejection – of the collectively created first-principles. Organizations like the Chamber of Digital Commerce and the Blockchain Association have been working for more than 10 years in Washington, D.C., to educate and advocate for sensible regulation. Then in 2020, Sam comes out of nowhere and starts speaking for all of us?  I got into crypto in 2015 because I believed we could build a better, fairer system that worked for everyone. We started this to get away from centralization and blind trust of people and institutions. The first successful companies were built with people who believed in a few founding principles, all to varying degrees: decentralization, privacy, self-custody, and removal of middlemen. Don’t trust, verify. Can’t be evil. The list goes on.  Read more: Who's Who in the FTX Inner Circle  We, the community of investors, users and crypto natives, allowed SBF to build FTX in a vacuum that didn’t follow these shared principles. FTX was notorious for not playing well with others, for bribing talent with equity and tokens, and for using influencer feedback loops to bewitch retail investors (not to mention regulators, lawmakers and journalists) who didn’t know better.  FTX built a team all made up of new-coiners, teaching them to mainline his Effective Altruism ""kool-aid"" until their blood ran blue. That talent base obviously couldn’t be trusted to build sensible decentralized systems because, well, they had never built them before. They were missing the industry exposure and understanding that only comes from salty wounds of the past. I wouldn’t be surprised if most of the employees of FTX leave the crypto ecosystem altogether without a second thought. Honestly, the rest of us wouldn’t miss them.  One year in crypto equals four years anywhere else  Crypto hiring is a fundamentally flawed process. We as an industry are (commercially) about 10 years old. We have a few things figured out by now: custody, wallets, block explorers, price indexes. The list goes on. We haven’t quite got lending and yields right, but there’s still time. Ten years of battle scars means that there are people who have direct experience in these areas, but somehow they aren’t getting to the jobs they know how to do.  Someone who spent five years in crypto after five in investment banking is a far superior candidate to someone who spent 20 years at JPMorgan without having ever touched crypto at all. My least favorite statement to hear as a recruiter is, “I’ve been following the space for a while ...” I’m sorry, no. A candidate like that wouldn’t have the foggiest idea how to approach risk or compliance or custody or cross-border payments for their international customers.  There is no substitute for the lessons learned in an early stage crypto company trying to secure basic bank accounts.  There is no substitute for knowing how to receive investor dollars in USDC and manage a crypto treasury.  Read more: 'A Complete Failure of Corporate Controls': What Investors and Accountants Missed in FTX’s Audits  There is no substitute for knowing the cause/effect of a decentralized community being divided on an issue, and what a hard fork would mean for their business.  There is no substitute for understanding the knock-on effects of a hard fork after a hack.  You get the gist. At some point we shouldn’t have to watch this movie again.  The thing the two aforementioned candidates differ on is context. Context can never be undervalued when it comes to building a principle-driven team. Stop it with the non-contextualized tradfi converts, please.  Context applies to everyone, especially HR  I have heard time and again, “They’re in HR, they don’t need to understand crypto.” Well yes, they do. Human Resource managers need the same industry context that hiring managers have, if not more, because they need to span across disciplines and job functions to filter the right candidates. Their process needs to be ideology focused, not competency based.  Many job postings aren’t reaching the right audiences because no one fits the mold of a traditional profile. Most crypto people didn’t go to an Ivy League school or graduate top of their class. They mined ether (ETH) in their dorm rooms in college or maybe even bought drugs on Silk Road (or its successors) with bitcoin (BTC). They blogged in 2014 about the failures of the modern banking system. They traded their way to moderate success on Kraken and KuCoin and learned about short squeezes from GameStop and Robinhood. They learned what custody was by losing their crypto on a defunct exchange. Sorry, there are no effective filtering metrics.  The first question in a job interview at a crypto company should be along the lines of:  “What is money?”  “What is decentralization?”  “Why does bitcoin matter?”  “Do you own any form of cryptocurrency?”  “Do you know what a wallet is, and do you have one?”  Just take the meeting  We need to recognize our own bias and get off the job description high horse. We need to spend our days meeting as many people as we can, through the people we already know. We need to trust those around us to verify and vouch for good talent, then just give it a shot – regardless of whether they meet our bogus idea of what we think we need.  We have to get crypto people back to work.  Teams that grow using this human-first strategy are more resilient, initiative-driven and make better decisions. Companies foster a collectivist culture where people understand their role in the company, and the companies’ responsibility to foster the growth of the whole ecosystem. Employees are happier too, because they don’t feel they are working in the world alone.  The community of crypto leaders have been very vocal over the last few weeks about what should have been done better and what we can do next time. Putting the too-little-too-late narrative aside, the biggest thing we can do now is back founders and hire teams who share similar fundamental ideologies to crypto itself.

Giving access to FTX's platform would let funds slip away to an untrustworthy Bahamas government, while inflammatory congressional testimony from new CEO John Ray III risked taking the case “off the rails,” the court was told by the two opposing parties.  The hearing occurred the day after FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was denied bail in a Bahamas courtroom after being arrested at the U.S.’ request. The exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. on Nov. 11, and was liquidated in the Bahamas shortly after.  “This is dangerous information,” James Bromley, representing Ray's FTX, said of a demand from Bahamas-based joint provisional liquidators (JPL) to be given access to the Amazon and Google cloud services that underpinned the exchange.  Read more: FTX CEO Warned Not to ‘Obstruct’ Bahamas Probe as He Gives Testimony  “We do not trust the Bahamian government and … we simply don't trust that the JPLs will be able to hold this information and not provide it to the Bahamian government,” he added. “The Securities Commission of the Bahamas has already collaborated with the JPLs to obtain access to digital assets and to mint tokens.”  Bromley is worried that access to the platform will enable cryptocurrency to be transferred out of U.S. control. He has previously submitted as evidence a Nov. 10 email between Bankman-Fried and Bahamas Attorney General Ryan Pinder that suggested local users of the site would be given preferential access to assets.  Meanwhile, Brian Simms and other provisional liquidators in the Bahamas say they need to be able to review records so they can identify company assets and maintain value, warning that some crucial data could be auto-deleted if there are overlong delays.  “I've seen a lot of mega-cases go off the rails,” Simms’ lawyer Chris Shore told the court, also warning of high legal costs from a protracted dispute.  Read more: FTX's Bahamas Liquidators Seek to Exclude Over $200M Worth of Luxury Properties From Liquidation  Given allegations “that a foreign government has colluded with somebody who is jailed right now … we’re at least tilting on the rails,” Shore said, in an apparent reference to congressional testimony given Tuesday by Ray about relations between Bankman-Fried and Bahamian authorities.  Judge Dorsey attempted to calm what he called a “heated debate,” and clearly hopes to find a solution that will let Simms get on with his job. Compromises were discussed such as offering a clone of the database, granting static access to information or setting legal limits on how Simms can use the data.  In a Tuesday statement, the Bahamas Securities Commission also hit out at Ray, accusing him of “misstatements” and of confusing Bahamian organizations that Shore noted are as distinct as Ray himself is from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Simms is also seeking access to employee Slack and email records and the off-the-shelf accounting software QuickBooks. Such platforms may have been used for substantive decision-making and governance at the multi-billion-dollar company, to Ray’s apparent surprise.  Founder Sam Bankman-Fried has previously complained that his lack of access to personal and professional data from his time at the company means he can’t give a full account of FTX’s collapse. He now faces not just media interest and congressional hearings but a series of charges brought by the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and commodities regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Dorsey will consider the case further on Friday and possibly at an additional Jan. 6 hearing, should mediation fail.

The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act would disallow financial institutions from transacting with digital asset mixers, which are services designed to conceal the origin of digital asset transactions. In addition, the bill would direct the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to classify digital asset wallet providers, miners, validators, and other crypto participants as money service businesses. That, in turn, would bring Know-Your-Customer requirements to the crypto space. “Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, our government enacted meaningful reforms that helped the banks cut off bad actors’ from America’s financial system,"" Marshall said in a statement. ""Applying these similar policies to cryptocurrency exchanges will prevent digital assets from being abused to finance illegal activities without limiting law-abiding American citizens’ access."" The proposed legislation comes after the downfall of crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ) and the subsequent criminal prosecution of its founder and ex-CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, spurred increased regulatory scrutiny across the digital asset ecosystem.

Shares of the digital asset-focused bank has plunged about 46% from when crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ) filed for bankruptcy protection on November 11. And the stock is off over 86% in the past year in the face of a broader bear market. Palmer attributed the one-month plunge to ""misleading commentary"" about the company on social media. He specifically pointed to its alleged ties with Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire, where FTX reportedly may have used the Silvergate Exchange Network to transfer customer funds to SBF's trading firm Alameda Research. In response to those allegations, U.S. lawmakers sent a letter to Silvergate ( SI ) CEO Alan Lane requesting clarity about its relationship with FTX and Alameda, adding further downward pressure to SI shares. In an exchange of Twitter direct messages last month between SBF and a Vox reporter, the onetime billionaire noted that those seeking funds available for trading through FTX in 2019 would transfer funds to Alameda, Palmer wrote in a note. Three years later, his team ""had basically forgot about the stub account that corresponded to that and so it was never delivered to FTX,” the message read. Taking that into account, Palmer reckoned ""the senators' assumption that FTX used the SEN to facilitate the transfer of customer funds to Alameda may be false."" In his view, ""if the FTX funds in question had been held by Alameda in anticipation of a transfer to the exchange that never happened, and Alameda then used those funds to make the 'risky bets' that the senators referenced, then there would be no basis for the suggestion that SI had acted improperly,"" according to the note. If that's the case, the ""SI Short Trade Appears Likely to End With [a] Short Squeeze,"" Palmer highlighted.

42411289,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMijv,1671033067,Understanding the Charges Brought Against Sam Bankman-Fried,"I was about to get on a plane late Monday when the arrest of FTX and Alameda Research founder Sam Bankman-Fried in the Bahamas first became public. His profound and manifold criminality has been obvious for weeks, with more signs of disturbing corruption seeming to emerge daily.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Despite the torrent of obscene revelations, there has been concern that Bankman-Fried’s recent media blitz, in which he portrayed himself as inept rather than malevolent, would succeed in softening the legal and regulatory response. A few misguided or bought-out voices have made statements sympathetic to Bankman-Fried. That has left everyone with a shred of decency and good sense gritting their teeth and hoping the dimwits and shills don’t get control of the narrative, possibly helping one of the biggest malefactors of our or any era evade consequences.  See also: Bankman-Fried Is a 'Master of Deflection,' Securities Lawyer Says  Well, we can breathe a sigh of relief. Charges filed over the past two days make clear that the U.S. government is treating Bankman-Fried as the ambitious and calculating criminal that he is, not as merely a bumbling tech wunderkind who made some bad bets. A laundry list of incredibly serious civil and criminal charges have come from three U.S. agencies: the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and, most importantly, the Department of Justice (DOJ).  The charges are comprehensive, and the theory of the case presented is unambiguous – all of the agencies claim that Sam Bankman-Fried knowingly and with significant forethought committed fraud on a scale only comparable to history’s most elaborate cons. FTX will be remembered alongside not just Enron, but the Credit Mobilier scandal of the 1860s-1870s and the South Sea swindle of the 1720s.  It turns out Sam Bankman-Fried was not a genius of crypto or finance, but he was unambiguously a kind of idiot savant of financial crime. There is a very good chance that he will never breathe free air again.  The charges  The three primary sets of charges are distributed according to the purview of the three charging agencies. The SEC supervises securities, and its charges focus on Bankman-Fried’s fraud against equity investors rather than against customers. Those charges will almost certainly result in huge fines and Bankman-Fried’s being barred from the financial industry, probably for life.  The SEC largely echoes the outline of the crimes I laid out a couple of weeks ago. The agency alleges, in part, that “Bankman-Fried orchestrated a years-long fraud to conceal from FTX’s investors the undisclosed diversion of FTX customers’ funds to Alameda Research LLC … the undisclosed special treatment afforded to Alameda on the FTX platform [and] undisclosed risk stemming from FTX’s exposure to Alameda’s significant holdings of overvalued, illiquid assets such as FTX-affiliated tokens.”  The CFTC basically oversees market structure, and the agency’s charges are focused on Bankman-Fried’s core crime: the commingling of depositor funds between FTX and the hedge fund Alameda Research. These are also civil charges that would mainly lead to monetary penalties.  But why pretend? What we really care about are the criminal charges, filed by the U.S. Department of Justice in the Southern District of New York. They are unbelievably extensive and serious, with wire fraud, conspiracy and money laundering making up just three of the eight total charges. The charging documents are reportedly vague on purpose, to give prosecutors leeway to assemble a case and specific allegations as their investigation progresses.  Partly because of that vagary, there have been varied estimates of the jail time Sam Bankman-Fried might face. But the litany of criminal charges seems to affirm previous estimates that he could, at least in theory, be in prison for the rest of his life.  He could get off easier if he is offered and chooses to accept a plea deal from prosecutors, but even such a deal would almost certainly involve many years of prison time. A plea deal would normally be quite likely, but there are two headwinds here. First, Bankman-Fried appears to be in a self-induced state of delusion; specifically, he seems to think he really did nothing wrong. That may lead him to pursue a jury trial instead of a deal, which is certainly what I’d love to see, too.  But there’s also no guarantee that Justice will offer a plea deal. It’s common for even very serious crimes, but public outrage about FTX has been so intense that the Biden administration could conceivably push for a high-profile prosecution to appease a furious public.  As many predicted, FTX being located in the Bahamas rather than the U.S. seems to have earned Bankman-Fried little protection. The DOJ’s criminal fraud charges, for instance, are based on an email sent to an investor in the Southern District of New York on Sept. 18 containing materially false information about FTX’s financial condition. Presumably, the email claimed that the company was thriving when in fact it had already been wrung dry by the criminals in charge.  See also: Did Sam Bankman-Fried Finally Admit the Obvious? | Opinion  And so the incredible downfall of Sam Bankman-Friend and his fraudulent empire progresses to a slower, more methodical stage. There will be more horrendous skeletons in the closet (I’m particularly curious to learn more about what was really going on at all those nonprofits).  But the general path of events from here has been set, and it will not end well for Sam Bankman-Fried. As you read this, he is in a maggot-infested Bahamian prison, awaiting what I hope will be a rapid extradition to a high-security facility in the United States. He must be adequately protected until he stands trial or reaches a plea deal.  So, bon voyage to the former wonder boy.

Related Reading: VanEck’s Bitcoin Prediction Stands At $10K-$12K By Q1 2023 With a price increase of around 50% within the last seven days, the token is the undisputed leader, followed by Stacks (+16%) and Bitcoin SV (+14%). Over the last 24 hours, Toncoin is writing a whopping 21% gain. While it was trading at $1.86 on Sunday, the cryptocurrency was trading for $2.86 at press time. In the last 24 hours alone, the trading volume has skyrocketed 83% to $95.4 million. On the daily chart, TON is thus approaching its all-time high of $3.26. A Reason For The Skyrocketing Price Of Toncoin The reason for the recent pump of the Toncoin could be a Telegram feature, which was announced last week. Pavel Durov, the founder and head of the popular messenger, introduced a feature that allows users to buy an anonymous phone number with the token and create an account with it. On December 07, the Telegram Messenger team launched the sale of virtual numbers with the +888 prefix, which is a collectible on The Open Network blockchain. Users can log in to the Fragment platform with the TON blockchain-backed anonymous numbers and enjoy “ultimate privacy.” Fragment is a decentralized auction platform founded by Durov. It sells anonymous numbers compatible only with Telegram. Purchases are transacted on the platform using The Open Network Telegram token. These numbers can then be used to chat completely anonymously but not to call or register with third-party services. In addition, purchased numbers can be stored in a regular Toncoin wallet, transferred to other users, and offered for sale on marketplaces, just like any other NFT on The Open Network blockchain. +888 8 888 Is The Most Popular Telegram Number Some numbers are so popular that they are auctioned on Fragment for over $100,000. The most popular number is +888 8 888, for which 38,290 TON, the equivalent of about $103,000, are currently being bid. The auction ran for a little more than six days. The Open Network is the brainchild of the Telegram development team, which was forced to abandon the blockchain solution due to pressure from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June 2020.

The U.S. investment management firm received a resounding rejection from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in November 2021 after a three-year battle. Just six months later, on June 24 of this year, VanEck reapplied for approval of a physically-backed Bitcoin ETF all over again. The SEC’s decision is currently pending. Despite this support, the investment firm has made a bearish prediction for BTC into the first quarter of 2023. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, shared this assessment in a recent media presentation. BTC Price Could Drop To $10,000 “Looking ahead, Bitcoin could test $10,000-$12,000 as Bitcoin miner bankruptcies increase due to the drop in Bitcoin value and increasing electricity costs,” VanEck predicts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hints At Potential Reversal, Buy The Dip? The investment firm believes that many miners will be forced to restructure or merge in order to find capital during difficult times. As Siegel explained, the mining industry is in a tremendous stress situation. We have an index which tracks the publicly traded companies in this sector; the median market cap is now below $200 million, and every one of these companies is burning cash, trading well below book value. In recent months, BTC has traded like a risk asset, Siegel said. What is surprising to the company, however, is its sensitivity to higher interest rates. VanEck sees one reason for this in policy responses to inflation in developed countries, which have capped energy prices and expanded sanctions against Russia. This has been a difficult proposition for Bitcoin mining, Sigel elaborated. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks Above $18,200 – CPI Data Comes In Better Than Expected Still, VanEck is optimistic that the BTC price could rebound to $30,000 in the second half of 2023 as inflation declines. Looking further, the investment firm points to the halving in 2024, an event that traditionally drives up BTC’s value. Bitcoin Miner Capitulation In Full Swing As NewsBTC reported, the second Bitcoin miner capitulation within one cycle has already started two weeks ago. Charles Edwards of Capriole Investments reported on November 28 that the hash ribbons had confirmed the start of the capitulation. Glassnode’s latest “Bitcoin miner net position change” data shows that miners have sold aggressively in the last two weeks, to an extent that historically has only been higher in early 2021. Bitcoin miner net position change (7d moving average). Source: Twitter Historically, miner capitulation has lasted an average of 48 days, so an end to the selling pressure could be foreseeable by mid-January 2023. However, this is not in line with VanEck’s Bitcoin prediction, which foresees a longer bear market. Despite the fact that miners have clearly given up their BTC holdings in the last week, the interesting thing about this currently is that the price of BTC is showing an upward trend.

Polkadot buyers were substantially lower on the charts for the past few weeks, but now, as the coin has reclaimed the $5 mark, buyers have started to take control of the price of the asset. The technical outlook for the coin has started to lean bullish on the chart. A climb above $5.30 will no doubt help the bearish pressure to wane. The demand for the altcoin has already seen a positive change, indicating that the altcoin was making a recovery on the chart. The altcoin, however, is not completely out of the woods. If Polkadot starts to consolidate instead of moving upwards, then the coin could lose momentum and fall back to the $5 price level. If the altcoin touches the $5 price mark, then the coin might fall into the selling zone again, which would bring the bears back. That would cause the price to tumble further. If the price of the altcoin manages to go back above the $5.30 mark, the coin could briefly rally. This could provide an entry point for traders to make quick profits. Related Reading: Bitcoin Zeroes In On $18,000 – Can BTC Upside Breakout Materialize? Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOT was trading at $5.20 at the time of this writing. The altcoin has shown signs of recovery after it turned the $5 resistance mark into its support line. Immediate resistance for the coin stood at $5.34. Breaching the $5.34 mark will propel the altcoin to $5.60, after which DOT might have a chance to trade near the $6.21 level. In the event that DOT starts to trade laterally, the first drop will take the coin to $5.04 and then to $4.84. This could make the altcoin depreciate by 9%. However, the amount of Polkadot traded in the last session was green, indicating the bulls are seizing more control. DOT Technical Analysis The altcoin is attempting to move into the buying zone after it got rejected twice in the same month. Demand has yet to move upward even as Polkadot tries to cross above the immediate resistance mark. The Relative Strength Index noted an uptick, which signified that buyers were trying to get hold of the price. Polkadot’s price was below the 20-Simple Moving Average line; although as it registered demand, the coin was trying to topple over the 20-SMA line. Presently, sellers continue to drive the price momentum in the market. With accumulation reflecting on the chart, the altcoin also depicted a buy signal for buyers to act on. The Awesome Oscillator indicates the price trend. The indicator painted a small green bar, which meant that the price direction was undergoing a shift. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence represents price momentum and trend reversal. MACD underwent a bullish crossover, which indicated a buy signal for the altcoin. This could be an entry point for traders.

The SEC accused Bankman-Fried of engaging in a scheme to defraud investors in Bahamas-headquartered FTX as well as the platform's customers. Shortly thereafter, the CFTC charged the onetime billionaire and his companies in a civil fraud lawsuit for allegedly affecting U.S. commodity prices such as bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ethereum ( ETH-USD ), as well as the misuse of customer funds and misleading statements, according to a release . Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) dropped as much as 7.3% in the days following FTX's bankruptcy on November 11. To date, though, the token gained 4.5% , as seen in this chart . The CFTC also alleged that FTX customer assets were ""routinely accepted and held"" by FTX's sister trading firm, Alameda Research, ""and commingled with Alameda’s funds."" While FTX and other crypto exchanges don't register with U.S. regulators, including the SEC and CFTC, they are still subject to U.S. rules that disallow fraud if they either deal with U.S. customers or operate within the country, The WSJ explained. The outlet also noted that regulators only need to prove that a defendant committed fraud that subsequently impacted commodity prices, thanks to a change in law that Congress passed 12 years ago.

42407233,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJsMT,1671028416,The Year Crypto Yields Blew Up,"Remember the halcyon days of DeFi summer? Bitcoin was roaring, the Grayscale arbitrage trade was wide open, the basis trade was just getting going, traditional finance (TradFi) interest rates were plummeting and the broader public started to realize that a fully liquid 10% on stablecoins looked pretty darn good compared to the 0% offered in their savings accounts. Maybe we couldn’t point exactly to what was “alpha” in that spread, but numbers like that allowed us a fair amount of leeway in deciding that “this is a better way.”  Alex McDougall is president and CEO of Stablecorp Inc. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023.  In these early days, decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized finance (CeFi) were yielding similar rates and there had never been a default in the industry because all loans were far overcollateralized and there was real economic value in posting bitcoin (BTC) as collateral and borrowing stables or fiat. Liquidity was also well matched because all loans were “open term” and any redemption requests could be met by liquidity on hand or calling back loans. I wrote a year in review article for this very series in December 2020 that I still stand by, mostly outlining why the industry worked based on the above dynamics.  Smash cut to today’s smoking wasteland of shattered dreams, shattered trust and near-zero yields. What happened? Was any of it real? Most importantly, what’s next?  Let’s spend the minimum amount of time on what happened because, honestly, it’s relatively simple, and the bad actors and details will be extensively documented in court cases for decades to come. The (criminally) short version:  The arbitrage opportunities dried up. Spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) came out in Canada and caused all the closed-end funds to trade at a discount, wiping out the Grayscale trade and exposing some cracks in “lending” models at certain platforms. The basis trade is roughly correlated to BTC and is wider when prices rise, so the price turn in May 2021 caused the basis trade to start closing up. It opened and closed throughout the rest of 2021, but by the start of 2022, with basis yielding low single digits, the easy sources of yield were gone. [Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.]  At this point, DeFi yields dropped precipitously and have stayed near 1%-3% on stablecoins since then on the bigger platforms including Compound and AAVE. However, CeFi yields stayed in the high-single digits (red flag number 1!) as CeFi platforms slowly began to erode lending/deployment standards to move up the risk curve to keep yields high. This took the form of lower credit quality, lower collateralization, direct deployment into arbitrage trades, yield farming or unproven projects like Anchor, locking up assets for term or, in the worst case, straight up fraud.  Ultimately, you can’t hide in DeFi but you can in CeFi, and that’s what happened in the end. When the arbitrage opportunities dried up, DeFi yields dropped algorithmically and assets under management (AUM) did as well, while CeFi yields stayed artificially high and AUM plowed in until it didn’t and it all ended in tears. There’s a bigger point to be made here about how DeFi platforms aren’t shareholder value maximizing machines and CeFi platforms are, but I’ll save that for another article.  Read more: Crypto 2023: It's Sanctions Season | Opinion  Credit fundamentals matter  Very little in digital asset yield land is truly “new.” Most of the lending models that were “created” or popularized through the rise of DeFi are actually just more public versions of models usually executed deep within gigantic financial institutions – securities lending being the main one.  However, in the zeal to dispense with links to Tradfi, the fundamentals of operating those models – asset liability matching, correlation and contagion risk, collateralization models and robust underwriting models – got left by the wayside. While blockchain technology makes the operation of these pools and models much more transparent, effective and efficient (whether CeFi or DeFi), these are not technology platforms. They are financial risk trading engines, and the finance part of DeFi cannot be forgotten.  DeFi fundamentals like transparency are a must  Trust has been shattered in the digital yield space. Platforms that have gone through bankruptcies or have cut off liquidity will likely never recover, and this will leave a very long lasting impression on those looking to redeploy into this space. The “I pay you 12% and you don’t ask questions” model is gone for now (although never say never …). The first step in creating new models is a step function improvement in transparency. It has always been shocking how opaque lending platforms have been in an industry as transparent and “on-chain” as blockchain. Fortunately, because of that very same transparent nature of blockchain, quite a bit of knowledge can be gained about loan books, volumes and liquidity from an outsider’s perspective, simply by monitoring on-chain flows from known wallets.  Going forward, there will be a significant amount of pressure on purely CeFi companies to disclose more information about their loan books and asset deployment strategies. There will also be a greater use of on-chain analytics tools to bootstrap that transparency where it is not forthcoming.  There is also an entirely new model that has sprung up around this desire for transparency, colloquially known as “CeDeFi,” which refers to CeFi-style lending using DeFi rails. With this type of platform you have (mostly) the same level of transparency as a DeFi platform (i.e,. you can see the full loan book in real time including named borrowers) as well as any collateral posted and some summary risk scores on the borrowers. Borrowers are underwritten by “pool delegates” – third parties who do the diligence and also stake “first loss” capital into the pool to align incentives.  See also: Where Is the Ethereum Virtual Machine Headed in 2023? (Hint: Beyond Ethereum) | Opinion  Underwriting is getting ready for its time in the sun  One critical evolution in this space has been the bifurcation of two schools of thought and action around collateral. Collateral, particularly in DeFi, has always been used as a hack or replacement for underwriting. You don’t need to underwrite a borrower on Compound if they are posting 150% of ether (ETH) that will be liquidated at 120%. However, at the same time, it was constantly acknowledged that collateral was inefficient and exclusionary by nature. To participate in DeFi, you needed to already have assets to post as collateral, and with overcollateralization you are by definition taking assets out of circulation.  Before the meltdown, the truly institutional lending desks already had quite sophisticated underwriting processes for their counterparties, and the ones who followed them generally stayed out of the news. Now, with the increased push in transparency, underwriting practices are coming to light like never before, and with increased default data it is becoming possible to battle test these models and begin to build legitimacy.  There are novel structures coming online to help managing tail risk  There have been other novel structures that have sprung up in the lead up to and in the aftermath of the meltdown to help manage the tail risks associated with this type of relatively new exposure.  The first is DeFi insurance such as Nexus or Unslashed. Effectively, DeFi insurance acts similarly to any other insurance policy where an event happens and you are able to file a claim for compensation. Except instead of an insurance company underwriting and selling you the policy, it is an insurance pool that you are buying insurance from and the providers of the capital are other participants on the platform. If you put capital into a pool and it is bought out as insurance on the other side, you cannot remove your capital until either someone else puts in new capital or an insurance policy is cancelled. In this way, all policies are always fully reserved with assets. These platforms are new and they are certainly not Lloyd’s of London, but they do work. With the UST depeg there are now myriad case studies of users covering their risks via these insurance policies.  The second is tranching-type structures like that employed on Idle Finance. Idle employs a methodology where it takes exposure to underlying CeFi and DeFi yield generating pools (and CeDeFi pools) and tranches the exposure between a junior and a senior tranche that are priced differently. The idea is that in a loss scenario the junior tranche is eaten away first before any losses are passed onto the senior tranche. To a certain extent, this type of tranching plays the same role as collateral in that there is a support system of assets pledged to the senior tranche that is eaten up first.  There are ways to optimize yields that add limited risk  When everything is transparent and written out in code, platforms become infinitely “composable” and it becomes possible to build optimization layers or additional incentivization layers on top of other platforms. Morpho Labs is a great example of this. It takes the core engine of platforms like Compound or Aave and enhances the matching engine to turn it into a P2P network that both increases yields as well as decreases borrowing costs purely by improving the technology instead of stepping up any risk or duration curves.  DeFi rails on top of TradFi yields are an important part of modern yield portfolio  Finally, it’s crucial to examine the current reality and build models for resiliency. TradFi yields are now routinely higher than what is available in the arbitrage-driven digital yield space. This likely won’t always be the case but it may be for some time. So breaking down those barriers between the structures able to access arbitrage-driven yields and those accessing TradFi yields, particularly “risk-free” type yields, becomes an extremely valuable source of advantage for the next generation of digital asset yield products.  Setting a risk and yield floor with the TradFi market and opportunistically seeking to enhance that yield with composable, optimized, underwritten, appropriately collateralized, insured, transparent digital yield solutions is what will bootstrap this next generation of yield platforms.  Finally, it will take time to rebuild, but don’t quit on the yield space. There will be more arbitrage, there has been exponential infrastructure progress, there is more and more data to train appropriate risk models and there are more and more innovative ways to manage unique and tail risks inherent in the space. The first inning ended with a fastball to the shin, but crypto has survived utter devastation before and the yield industry will rebuild itself faster, more efficiently and more composable than before.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | TRADING,Alex McDougall,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/14/digital-yield-market-rebuild,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79a10be2959ec5adbe5dc99223c226fa3344a2d0-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42388430,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRGAFH,1671027641,Indian Crypto Traffic Took a Nosedive as Tax Regime Tightened,"Indians have lost interest in trading on local crypto exchanges since the government began imposing taxes on profits and transactions, data from AppTweak and SimilarWeb shows.  However, interest in Binance, the world's largest exchange by trading volume, has remained more or less constant. The exchange is not based in India and thus is not subject to its jurisdiction, even if its users are.  Visits to Indian exchanges Wazir X, CoinDCX, CoinSwitch Kuber and ZebPay fell 80% between Feb. 1 – when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government announced a 30% tax on crypto profits and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on all transactions – and Oct. 31, according to SimilarWeb. App downloads fell 93%, AppTweak shows.  The tax on crypto gains kicked in starting April 1 and was set at the same level as taxes on earnings from online casinos. But the industry was hit harder by the second tax, which took effect July 1 and was aimed “more for tracking transactions,” Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.  “The real killer has been the 1% TDS on each transaction,” said Ajeet Khurana, a crypto analyst and founder of Web3 platform Reflexical. “Because effectively this tax tells people not to transact. This has dampened sentiments the most.”  Foreign exchanges  While trading volumes crashed as much as 70% on Indian exchanges days after the imposition of the tax regime, the data shows website traffic for Binance remained more or less constant from June.  As for downloads, by July 22 – around three weeks after the start of the transaction tax – unique installations of Binance overtook all Indian exchanges.  “Effectively we have gifted volume to Binance,” Khurana said. “People will feel compelled to trade on international exchanges such as Binance because Binance will not implement the TDS.”  The move isn’t necessarily indicative of tax evasion, Khurana said. A notification from the income tax regulator said residents are supposed to calculate and file taxes themselves when an international exchange doesn’t implement TDS because it doesn’t fall under Indian jurisdiction.  In response to Parliamentary questions from opposition member of parliament Vivek K. Tankha on Tuesday, Pankaj Choudhary of the Finance Ministry said it does not register foreign crypto exchanges, and the same tax rules apply to anyone trading crypto irrespective of whether the exchange is registered in India or abroad.  The response also revealed that the government earned $7.3 million through TDS since its implementation.  ""The amount of tax earned by the government shows that the actual net volume of all the exchanges combined is around 6,000 crores ($727 million) in Q3 2022 which is way below as compared to 2021, when the crypto market witnessed a massive bull run,"" said Shivam Thakral, CEO of Indian exchange BuyUcoin.  The “poorly designed 30% capital gains tax on crypto assets and sledgehammer approach of 1% TDS on exchange-traded transactions coincided with [the] global rout in cryptocurrencies to kill Indians' interest in cryptocurrencies,” said Subhash Garg, a former secretary in the Finance Ministry’s Department of Economic Affairs.  That’s evident not only in transactions but also in interactions with mobile platforms. Searches of keywords including “bitcoin” and “crypto” have dramatically declined, while negative terms such as “scam,” “waste” and “fraud” have increased on reviews and ratings of popular apps in the past 90 days, AppTweak’s data shows.  “Keyword search volumes (indexed between 5 as the lowest and 100 as the highest) reveal that the popularity of the keyword ""bitcoin"" fell from 72 to 34,” said Karan Lakhwani, AppTweak’s India head. “A similar trend was observed for the keyword ‘crypto,’ wherein keyword search volume fell from 81 to 37.”  Read More: Crypto Trading Volumes in India Collapse 10 Days After New Tax: Crebaco",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/14/indian-crypto-traffic-took-a-nosedive-as-tax-regime-tightened,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1e52dc3e35bc43280915b71c2437f60c6ef7865-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42407236,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJsZh,1671027395,"I, Trading Bot","Movies about stock traders and investors often depict Wall Street mercenaries with great hair or uber-nerds wedded to their computers, but the age of the human trader is already a thing of the past. Welcome to the age of the “bot.”  Trading bots use algorithms that execute trades when certain market conditions are met. Since the early 2000s there has been strong growth in these bots especially as market data has become more sophisticated. Now the algorithms are being unleashed on the crypto markets.  Nathan Thompson is the lead tech writer at Bybit. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023 series.  Algorithmic trading is used across most capital markets. According to a 2020 report from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 78% of market trades were performed by “trading centers [that] depend on automated systems and algorithms.” Other commentators peg the volume of stock trades coming from bots at 60% to 70%.  Institutional traders rent or create their own bots that activate when the market hits certain conditions. These algorithms constantly search markets for the right trade setups, such as finding oversold stocks or trading a breakout. When they find the right conditions bots run scripts that determine the position size, execute the trade, employ stop-losses and exit automatically.  The bots are not perfect because they are created using past data, but the latest artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technology are already being employed – making them faster and more efficient than ever. Further, bots take the emotion out of trading (helping to stymie some of the emotional burden of investing in volatile markets).  See also: Become a Better Crypto Trader by Avoiding These Cognitive Biases | Opinion  “Reason is a slave to the passions” as philosopher David Hume said, and humans are by definition constantly at risk of making bad decisions based on emotions. For example, the infamous “revenge trade” happens when a trader fires ill-advised bids into the market in a desperate attempt to recoup a large loss, usually compounding their defeat.  More insidious is the fact that people don’t like being wrong. This makes them stay in a trade too long out of an irrational attachment to the company or digital asset when exiting is the best strategy.  Trading bots also don’t need sleep and thrive in the 24/7 crypto markets, where they are often used to take advantage of high volatility and arbitrage opportunities. Access to the bots is more egalitarian too, with most major centralized exchanges (CEX) offering trading bots to their users.  The most common bot strategy is the grid bot, which automatically places buy and sell orders within a specific range. If the underlying asset falls out of range then the account will either be stopped out or left inactive until the user resets it. And if the underlying goes on a tear then those profits will be left on the table because the bot stops trading at the top of a given range.  As part of a diversified investment strategy, trading bots can have a place in a properly allocated portfolio for both retail and institutional investors. They can be used alongside passive income strategies, or buying bonds, as a way of making small points on under-utilized capital. It’s possible to have multiple bots running for different assets and strategies further enhancing asset diversification.  See also: What Does an AI Chatbot 'Think' About DeFi?  Will human instinct and cunning be forever trumped by the crop of bots running rampant in our markets?

At the World Digital Mining Summit in Cancun, Mexico, last month, Bitmain, the world’s largest bitcoin mining rig manufacturer and the host of the conference, touted Latin America, particularly Paraguay and Argentina, as promising countries for mining. About a quarter of the conference was dedicated to the topic of “Latin America: Unlimited Potential Blockchain Land.”  Read more: Paraguay Votes Down Crypto Regulatory Bill in a Blow to Crypto Mining Industry  Argentina’s BitPatagonia and Paraguay’s Penguin Digital were invited to present, while Yiding (Fred) He, Bitmain’s director of business development, talked up the region’s potential, although he cautioned that it’s important to find the right partner to work with in Latin America.  Bitmain itself is looking into opportunities in the region, as are many other major firms.  The availability of cheap electricity in Europe, North America and former Soviet countries has dried up this year, partly because inflation and the war in Ukraine are driving up energy prices and partly because regulators and grids are hitting the brakes on mining as they assess what effects it has on their communities.  Read more: Canada's Manitoba Province Enacts 18-Month Moratorium on New Crypto Mining  As a result, companies were looking at Latin America, a region that still has untapped energy potential. Paraguay, in particular, boasts a relatively low price of under five cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) and as low as 35 cents. Many industrial miners in the U.S. are facing prices over that.  But Paraguay’s national grid operator and the government have asked miners to pay as much as 60% over the industrial price of electricity. A bill to stop that plan was voted down in the Paraguayan legislature on Dec. 6, meaning miners’ margins will be far thinner than what they had calculated before.  Meanwhile, high energy prices have already thinned out miners’ margins around the world, leading to some high-profile liquidity crunches.  The contagion  In previous conferences held at exotic locations, participants would often take meetings in the pool, or at least by the pool, and take time to catch up before getting to business. But this time, meetings were far more serious, and miners were bringing to the table printed financial presentations to now-scrupulous financiers, one attendee remarked.  The mining industry has been hit hard by the crypto winter. Miners’ direct exposure to flailing companies like bankrupt crypto exchange FTX appears to be minimal and mostly through intermediary companies such as crypto lender bankrupt BlockFi and others. (That is with the exception of Celsius Network, a bankrupt crypto lender that was operating a mining arm.) But they have felt the effects of the crypto winter as much as anyone. Miners’ revenues have declined massively, along with the price of bitcoin (BTC), while energy prices have been soaring.  Big companies in the mining industry like Compute North and Core Scientific (CORZ) have been affected, along with smaller firms that face higher energy prices. Few, like CleanSpark (CLSK), have been in a position to take advantage of the situation to buy distressed assets.  During the last dinner in Cancun, closed to most attendees of the event, Micree Zhan, co-founder and chairman of the board at Bitmain, unveiled the price of a special batch of new S19 XP Hyd. mining machines. The price was planned to be $19 per terahash (TH). But Zhan, speaking with a hoarse voice, decided on the spot to lower it to $18.5/TH in light of the revelations about FTX and how the market reacted. (Terahash is a measure of computing power.)

The exchange has endured $902 million of net outflows (the difference between the value of assets arriving and leaving the exchange) in the last 24 hours, according to data from Nansen. Binance’s net outflow has surpassed those of all other centralized exchanges’ and is almost nine times larger than the second-largest outflow. It is also the highest outflow for the exchange since Nov. 13, which was two days after rival exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy protection. The withdrawals come as traders look to an announcement from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday about interest rates. The Fed is widely expected to raise its benchmark rate by 0.5 percentage point.  Following the outflows, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao warned his staff to expect turbulent times ahead. Amid concerns about the exchange’s financial health, he wrote in an internal memo, ""While we expect the next several months to be bumpy, we will get past this challenging period – and we'll be stronger for having been through it.""  FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried will be remanded into custody after a Bahamas judge ruled Bankman-Friedshould be denied bail. Bankman-Fried's attorneys initially asked the judge to consider that he be released on $250,000 bail, arguing he needed to be able to regularly take medication, including Zyrtec, an over-the-counter allergy medication, and keep to his vegan diet. Prosecutors in the Bahamas argued that granting Bankman-Fried bail would go against a treaty with the U.S. that requires defendants to be held in custody pending extradition proceedings. Bankman-Fried told the judge he wouldn’t waive his right to fight the extradition effort, suggesting he may seek to remain in the Bahamas.     Chart of the Day  The chart shows the total number of stablecoins held in centralized exchange wallets has dropped by nearly 12% to a six-month low of 38.61 billion in one month.  The balance has declined by 8% this week alone.  Investors have been taking direct custody of their coins since FTX filed for bankruptcy last month. The trend has accelerated this week, with Binance facing ""extra scrutinies and tough questions"" in the wake of FTX's collapse.

The CPI was 7.1% on an annual basis in November, slower than a Refinitiv consensus estimate of 7.3% and down from October's 7.7% reading. Core inflation, which strips the volatile food and energy components, dropped to 6.0% from 6.3% the month before.  The data, which strengthen expectations for a slowdown in the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest-rate increase path and a pivot to liquidity easing in second-half 2023, lifted risk assets. Bitcoin jumped over 3% to $18,000 following the CPI release, the highest since Nov. 10, CoinDesk data shows. The S&P 500 gained 0.7%, while the dollar index dropped to a six-month low.  Optimism stemming from an assumption that once the Fed turns dovish institutions will again have access to cheaper money may be premature, however. Slower inflation often portends a decline in earnings per share (EPS), a barometer of corporate profitability. And that usually weighs on stocks and zaps overall risk appetite in financial markets. Bitcoin has moved in lockstep with equities since last year.  ""Those who find a lower inflation print a good opportunity to buy risk assets should look away now,"" Andreas Steno Larsen, founder and CEO of Steno Research, noted in the inflation review published Tuesday. ""Remember that the PPI (and the CPI, for that matter) is a leading indicator for EPS ... And if we allow the oil future to predict PPI, then we are in for negative EPS growth already during Q2/Q3-2023,"" he wrote, referring to the producer price index.  The PPI measures the average movements of prices received by domestic producers for goods and services sold on the domestic or international market. The U.S. PPI follows oil price movements closely and serves as a leading indicator for CPI.  ""This is NOT priced into expectations for equities. A revisit of the 3500-3600 should be on the cards for S&P 500,"" Larsen said. The benchmark U.S. stock index closed at 4019.65 on Tuesday.  The chart shows PPI will likely turn negative in the second quarter of next year. The projection is based on the price of oil futures.

42420794,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYH6r,1671021000,Binance Founder ‘CZ’ Insists We Can Trust His Crypto Exchange – but Can We?,"Monday’s arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried (“SBF”) capped off a historic period in the world of memes, money and mayhem that is the cryptocurrency industry. The arrest of the FTX exchange founder drew mainstream headlines that greatly overshadowed the other big crypto story of the day: questions around the solvency of Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume.  If the collapse of FTX was catastrophic for the burgeoning crypto industry, a collapse of Binance would be apocalyptic.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  FTX – at one point the third-largest crypto exchange by spot volume – processed around $37 billion in spot trades in October, the month before it collapsed, according to CryptoCompare. The second-largest exchange, Coinbase, processed $47 billion that month. Meanwhile, Binance’s spot trading volume in October totaled a whopping $390 billion.  For over a month, Binance CEO Chanpeng Zhao (“CZ”), like other exchange leaders, has been on a quest to convince users that his product is wholly different from FTX – the SBF-led exchange that became insolvent after misusing user funds.  Like FTX, though, Binance is largely unregulated, and not everyone is buying CZ’s repeated assurances of propriety. Over the past week, a shoddy audit of the exchange’s reserves – followed by news of criminal investigations into Binance executives – alarmed users enough to catalyze record withdrawals from the platform.  While Binance appears to be weathering the storm so far (there are no glaring signs that the exchange has misappropriated user funds FTX-style), recent events have drawn attention to the fact that Binance, which exists beyond the scope of regulators and tracks customer holdings on its own servers rather than on public blockchains, asks for a tremendous amount of trust from its users in order to operate. In the “trustless” world of cryptocurrency, this is a bit hard to square.  Trusting Binance  The biggest players in crypto are centralized exchanges – platforms like FTX, Coinbase, Kraken and Binance – that take direct custody of user cryptocurrency (rather than leave tokens in a user’s own blockchain wallet) in order to facilitate trades.  After investors were burned by FTX – the largest crypto exchange to collapse after abusing the trust of its depositors – people have grown wary of trusting other, similarly centralized platforms. But not all cryptocurrency exchanges that custody user funds have earned the same degree of skepticism.  Unlike U.S.-regulated exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, Binance (like FTX) operates in a sort of regulatory gray area. The firm was originally founded in China but left the country in 2017 just before its government banned cryptocurrency trading. Today, Binance deliberately obfuscates where it is headquartered.  While there are jurisdiction-specific versions of Binance, like Binance.US, which operate independently from the main Binance platform, the main, largely unregulated version of Binance is the biggest by far. (Binance.US doesn’t even rank among the top 10 crypto exchanges by spot trading volume.)  Coinbase, Kraken, Binance.US and other jurisdiction-specific Binance platforms make routine accounting disclosures and face strict oversight from regulators. The main Binance platform, however, isn’t subject to the same regulatory scrutiny as its peers. As such, it can offer relatively low fees along with products that it would be unable to run in the U.S. and many other countries – like sophisticated derivative contracts and margin trading facilities that allow users to borrow money in order to make bigger, riskier bets.  As a consequence of Binance’s regulation dodging, though, the platform’s users need to trust Binance’s word on whether their money is where it purports to be.  Record withdrawals  Fears of a Binance insolvency reached a fever pitch over the weekend after a much-derided “proof-of-reserves” report from the exchange failed to convince onlookers that it was fully collateralizing assets behind the scenes.  Widespread skepticism towards the report – which users criticized for its lack of thoroughness and selective disclosures – sparked record outflows from Binance, with investors pulling nearly a billion dollars from the exchange in a period of just 24 hours over the weekend.  Money continued to pour out of the exchange on Monday after a report from Reuters detailed a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into Binance – one of several ongoing probes into the firm from global law enforcement agencies. According to Reuters, federal prosecutors are weighing whether to charge Binance executives, including CZ, with money-laundering violations.  News of Binance’s legal troubles opened the floodgates even wider; users were soon criticizing Binance for everything from its ability to change the ledger of its “decentralized” BNB blockchain, to the solvency of “bridged” versions of BUSD, Binance’s stablecoin.  “Binance FUD” (meaning fear, uncertainty and doubt) briefly trended on Twitter.  The USDC pause  On Monday, Binance saw another $2 billion in net withdrawals from its platform – the largest withdrawal event for the exchange since this past June, according to crypto analytics firm Nansen.  The outflows were large enough to force Binance to temporarily pause withdrawals of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin – a vital instrument in crypto financial markets that stays “pegged” to the price of one dollar.  Binance said it needed to pause USDC withdrawals in order to facilitate a “token swap” of USDC stablecoins for its own BUSD stablecoins – a sort of practical measure necessary to loosen up liquidity for further withdrawals.  However, the move sparked worrying headlines, including one from CNBC, reflecting that some users saw the pause as yet another signal that Binance might not be fully collateralizing user assets behind the scenes. (Notably, pausing stablecoin withdrawals was one of the last actions FTX took before filing for bankruptcy.)  Despite the uproar, Binance’s explanation for why it paused USDC withdrawals is plausible on its face. Moreover, Nansen’s accounting of Binance-linked blockchain wallets shows that the exchange has at least $60 billion in on-chain reserves – more than enough liquidity to handle customer withdrawal demands and vastly more than FTX had (as a percentage of overall user assets) when it collapsed.  But without a full accounting of Binance’s assets and liabilities, the exchange’s health is impossible to judge definitively.  Why should Binance be trusted?  Despite Binance’s opaqueness, users continue to rely on the platform.  The largest crypto exchange offers users the ability to trade more kinds of tokens, with higher liquidity and lower fees, than virtually any other platform – centralized or decentralized. It also offers strategies that are inaccessible, in many jurisdictions, to anyone other than licensed investors.  But the fact that Binance is the only shop in town for certain trading activities isn’t the only reason why some investors continue to trust CZ with their money.  Wave Financial CEO David Siemer told CoinDesk that while he is wary of all centralized exchange platforms, he is relatively unconcerned that Binance will face FTX-type insolvency.  For one thing, says Siemer, Binance was founded in 2017 and simply has a longer track record than FTX, which was founded in 2019.  Siemer also noted that Binance has been relatively conservative in terms of the features it offers users – at least compared to FTX. “From a functionality standpoint,” said Siemer, “Binance rolls things out that are pretty tried and true.”  FTX, says Siemer, partially failed because it advertised a high-tech – but error-prone – cross-margining system. In essence, the system was supposed to allow a user to take multiple separate positions against a single pool of collateral; if one of a user’s bets went bust, the whole pool was subject to liquidation (meaning the FTX exchange would have automatically claimed the user’s collateral).  In Siemer’s experience, this system didn’t always work as advertised; users were sometimes able to make big bets that weren’t auto-liquidated when they should’ve been – meaning investors might have lost the exchange’s (and, it seems, other users’) money on bets that they should’ve lost.  Unlike FTX, Binance “[doesn’t] allow a lot of crazy, weird margining” features like cross-margining, said Siemer.  And then, says Siemer, there’s the fact that Binance “doesn't have an Alameda.” Alameda Research was the SBF-linked trading firm that collapsed after it apparently invested (and lost) funds belonging to FTX users.  “Because [FTX] had Alameda,” said Siemer, “both sides were able to just kind of prop each other up for a long, long time.”  While it’s technically possible that Binance is using or loaning out user funds behind the scenes (the firm is apparently under investigation for money laundering), there’s no sister firm like Alameda to which Binance would have obviously funneled money.  The importance of PR  While one can find some differences between Binance and FTX, it’s impossible to know what’s really going on at Binance behind the scenes. CZ, for his part, seems acutely aware of the fact that his exchange will live or die based on the trust of its users.  Amid all the “FUD,” the Binance founder – at one point more of a behind-the-scenes operator – has become uncharacteristically active on social media in recent months as the market has soured and the FTX debacle has continued to unfold.  In between tweets defending Binance, CZ has also found time to joke around with his followers, and he recently retweeted a tweet from 2019 in which he explained that he was “a normal guy, nothing fancy” and aimed to “seek and provide positive energy.”  In this way, one finds a striking similarity between CZ and SBF, his one-time nemesis. Both founders realize that in a world of centralization and lax regulations – perception is everything.",NEGATIVE,BNB | USDC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB | USDC,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/12/14/binance-founder-cz-insists-we-can-trust-his-crypto-exchange-but-can-we,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ce2244fe237a7b5e67b9e781d9c601b1cab18a2-5568x3712.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, in the year, the value of bitcoin plummeted due to macroeconomic factors. Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, and 2022 has seen a prolonged bear market phase that has left investors reeling. As a result, most crypto assets have seen their value plummet, and FUD is rising in the market. Related Reading: LINK Still On ETH Whales’ Shopping Cart Despite Dismal Performance In Last 7 Days Stablecoins were considered viable alternatives. However, the collapse of Terra created doubts about this theory and has left crypto investors looking for a haven for their tokens. But despite price fluctuations, bitcoin has proven its longevity and rewarded investors for their belief. Although some individuals debate its long-time value, it is the most adopted cryptocurrency worldwide. El Salvador recognizes the number one cryptocurrency as a legal tender and is bullish on its future. Investing Retirement Fund In Bitcoin – Is It A Good Idea? The bearish movement of the market does not move U.S. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis. Instead, she advised Americans to feel safe investing their retirement savings in bitcoin. She is a well-established bitcoin advocate and also has investments in BTC. Despite the unfortunate events on the crypto horizon, she remains unfazed. In an interview, she stated that adding BTC to 401(k) plans is a prosperous move. Senator Lummis regards BTC as different from other cryptocurrencies. She based this assertion on bitcoin’s scarcity. Bitcoin has a maximum market capitalization of 21 million. Therefore, according to her, it will only increase the price of the coin in the future. Related Reading: How Litecoin (LTC) Outperforms Other Top Cryptocurrencies In This Department However, some other American political heavyweights are not so comfortable with the idea of investing BTC into retirement funds. For example, Senator Elizabeth Warren scrutinized Fidelity’s decision to allow investors to include bitcoin in their 401(k) retirement plans. Senator Lummis is pushing to reintroduce her proposed crypto bill in January. She intends to discuss the details with the SEC. This bill aims at giving consumers maximum protection and creating some taxation benchmarks. Be Grateful For Bitcoin Lummis tongue-lashed the U.S. authorities for letting the U.S. fall into a financial crisis. According to her, the value of the U.S. dollar can decline in the coming years. She believes the best approach is for fiscal policy officials to ensure that non-fiat currencies blossom. She believes that the decentralized nature of bitcoin grants investors much-needed financial freedom. It will also shield Americans if the dollar were to lose its value. The senator has supported bitcoin passionately over the years with investments in the token. She purchased 5 BTC in 2033, close to the $300 mark, and added BTC worth $100,000 to her holdings last August. Also, many experts share their thoughts on cryptocurrencies as a store of future value as events unfold.",POSITIVE,BTC | LTC,BTC | BUSINESS | LTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/senator-lummis-claims-pouring-retirement-funds-in-bitcoin-is-still-a-good-idea/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

5572653,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512393,1671017883,VanEck’s Bitcoin Prediction Stands At $10K-$12K By Q1 2023,"VanEck is one of a handful of companies that continues to fight for the approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF. The U.S. investment management firm received a resounding rejection from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in November 2021 after a three-year battle. Just six months later, on June 24 of this year, VanEck reapplied for approval of a physically-backed Bitcoin ETF all over again. The SEC’s decision is currently pending. Despite this support, the investment firm has made a bearish prediction for BTC into the first quarter of 2023. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, shared this assessment in a recent media presentation. BTC Price Could Drop To $10,000 “Looking ahead, Bitcoin could test $10,000-$12,000 as Bitcoin miner bankruptcies increase due to the drop in Bitcoin value and increasing electricity costs,” VanEck predicts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hints At Potential Reversal, Buy The Dip? The investment firm believes that many miners will be forced to restructure or merge in order to find capital during difficult times. As Siegel explained, the mining industry is in a tremendous stress situation. We have an index which tracks the publicly traded companies in this sector; the median market cap is now below $200 million, and every one of these companies is burning cash, trading well below book value. In recent months, BTC has traded like a risk asset, Siegel said. What is surprising to the company, however, is its sensitivity to higher interest rates. VanEck sees one reason for this in policy responses to inflation in developed countries, which have capped energy prices and expanded sanctions against Russia. This has been a difficult proposition for Bitcoin mining, Sigel elaborated. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks Above $18,200 – CPI Data Comes In Better Than Expected Still, VanEck is optimistic that the BTC price could rebound to $30,000 in the second half of 2023 as inflation declines. Looking further, the investment firm points to the halving in 2024, an event that traditionally drives up BTC’s value. Bitcoin Miner Capitulation In Full Swing As NewsBTC reported, the second Bitcoin miner capitulation within one cycle has already started two weeks ago. Charles Edwards of Capriole Investments reported on November 28 that the hash ribbons had confirmed the start of the capitulation. Glassnode’s latest “Bitcoin miner net position change” data shows that miners have sold aggressively in the last two weeks, to an extent that historically has only been higher in early 2021. Historically, miner capitulation has lasted an average of 48 days, so an end to the selling pressure could be foreseeable by mid-January 2023. However, this is not in line with VanEck’s Bitcoin prediction, which foresees a longer bear market. Despite the fact that miners have clearly given up their BTC holdings in the last week, the interesting thing about this currently is that the price of BTC is showing an upward trend. At press time, BTC was trading at $17,882, with today’s FOMC meeting starting at 14:30 ET very likely to have a significant impact on price action in the coming weeks.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/vanecks-bitcoin-prediction-stands-at-10k-12k-by-q1-2023/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42414744,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBJfeB,1671014826,"Citi Says Crypto Market Leverage, Open Interest Are Historically Low","The past year in the digital asset market has been characterized by a series of negative shocks, triggered initially by the collapse of Terra/LUNA, Citi (C) said in a research report Monday looking back on the year.  “Leverage, volatility and interest have faded as investors battle with declining prices,” analysts led by Joseph Ayoub wrote. “Retail interest has broadly diminished as prices have declined,” and this has “coincided with a more general decline in volatility.”  Institutional interest has also declined. This “loss of trust” followed the failure of many centralized entities, and is reflected in exchange-traded product (ETP) flows, which have remained negative throughout the year, the report said.  Against a broader macro backdrop of inflation concerns, rising interest rates and tightening financial conditions, total crypto market cap has declined by about 61% compared to an 18% drop for the S&P 500 index, the report added.  The bank says the bankruptcies of crypto exchange FTX and lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital were failures of centralized entities rather than decentralized entities, “perhaps signifying the resilience of decentralized finance protocols.” Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications carried out on a blockchain.  Bitcoin open interest saw a significant decline, the note said. It started the year at more than $23 billion and has dropped to around $9 billion. Leverage has also largely declined. Open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts held by investors and represents active positions.  The bank notes there is still over $150 billion in market cap across stablecoins. This type of cryptocurrency saw only 5% net redemptions in 2022. However, relative declines show different investor behavior and diverging confidence in stablecoins, with tether (USDT) losing as much as $10 billion in market cap, while USD coin (USDC) stayed roughly level and Binance USD (BUSD) increased.  Spot trading volumes have remained resilient despite falling crypto prices, and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes have grown in recent weeks following the collapse of FTX. The demise of FTX has “further bolstered policymaker calls for crypto regulation, placing a greater emphasis on consumer protection,” according to the note.

42414741,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBJfYs,1671014543,Celsius Seeks $7.7M From Voyager's Estate as Bankruptcy Cases Intertwine,"Lawyers for bankrupt lender Celsius Network are seeking to claw back $7.7 million from the estate of rival Voyager Digital as judges wrangle over the exact legal status of Celsius’ assets.  The U.S. bankruptcy code allows clawback of transactions that took place up to three months before Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on July 13, sauid documents filed in a court in the Southern District of New York in the early hours of Wednesday morning.  “Voyager maintained Earn accounts with Celsius, which earned significant rewards for its users,” the filing said, citing Voyager transactions of $7.7 million between Celsius accounts, of which $5.9 million was withdrawn, during the crucial 90-day period. “Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code allows Celsius to claw back that cryptocurrency.”  Other withdrawals and transfers could also be subject to challenge, Celsius said, but added that the figure was still small in Voyager’s total pool of $1.85 billion in unsecured claims.  Voyager itself had filed for bankruptcy protection July 5, and claims against the company were supposed to be filed by Oct. 3. Celsius is begging for a deadline extension, saying that it had been too preoccupied with its own legal case, and that Voyager had sent its legal notice to an out-of-date address for Celsius’ U.K. arm.  On Dec. 8, Martin Glenn, overseeing the Celsius case, ordered $50 million worth of crypto held in Celsius’ “Custody” program to be returned to customers, and on Tuesday approved the sale of Celsius’ self-custody platform GK8 to Galaxy Digital as he winds up the estate.

5567936,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512386,1671012475,CFTC Deems Ethereum A Commodity In Recent Court Filing – Here’s Why,"Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have their fair share of controversy regarding categorization. Government regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) have had past battles with other digital assets. The SEC is currently embroiled in a long-running case with Ripple Labs, with the focus on defining the XRP token as a security. Related Reading: LINK Still On ETH Whales’ Shopping Cart Despite Dismal Performance In Last 7 Days The CFTC also views all virtual currencies as commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). However, this stance by the regulatory body is controversial since cryptocurrencies pride themselves on being decentralized. However, in light of recently outrageous events in the crypto space, the CTFC and SEC are more determined than ever to increase regulation and proper checks. Investors also desire more crypto coordination, transparency, and honesty to prevent future catastrophes. CTFC Vs. Ethereum The CTFC has labeled Ethereum as a commodity again during a recent court filing. This stance contradicts the position maintained by chief Rostin Behnam in his statement on November 30. According to Behnam, Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that should be classified as a commodity. The CTFC, in its lawsuit against Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX, and Alameda research, referred to Bitcoin, Tether (USDT), and Ether as commodities under the provisions of the United States law. The body quoted the law from Section 1a (9) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1a (9). The CTFC has been internally divided on its viewpoint to group Ether as a commodity in the past weeks. Benham said that Bitcoin is the sole crypto asset that should be called a commodity. This view is in contrast to the filing. SEC To Be Granted More Power? Meanwhile, popular crypto skeptic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is said to be preparing a bill to grant the SEC more regulatory authority over crypto assets. Jeffrey Sprecher, Intercontinental Exchange CEO, believes that crypto assets will eventually be called securities. During a financial services conference on December 6, Sprecher stated that this move would ensure greater consumer protections. However, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler is currently undecided on the subject. In an interview with Jim Cramer during the Mad Money show on June 27, Gensler confirmed that Bitcoin was a commodity. “That’s the only one I’m, going to say,” he stated. Related Reading: How Litecoin (LTC) Outperforms Other Top Cryptocurrencies In This Department He had suggested that Ether was security after its initial coin offering (ICO). But it had become more decentralized and evolved into a commodity. In September, he also seemed to reconsider his stance during Ether’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (POS). Gensler stated that staked tokens might be considered securities under the Howey Test.

Ether posted on-day gains of 4.46%, according to CoinDesk market data, coming in at $1,332 by late afternoon Asia time. Bitcoin gained 3.7%, hitting $17,805.  Bitcoin recently hit a one-month high earlier this week ahead of U.S. inflation data, and its dominance has cracked 41%, CoinDesk previously reported. Digital assets are generally rising as traders expect the Federal Reserve to slow down its inflation-fighting interest rate hikes.  ""This is the main trigger in the increase in prices,"" Raphael Kim, the founder of Seoul-based crypto VC Reframe, told CoinDesk. Kim said the lower-than-expected data in the CPI was a relief to many traders, who are building a post-FTX investment narrative.  Many other tokens on the CoinDesk 20 were up during the Asia afternoon trading session, in particular those associated with layer 1 tokens including Avalanche (AVAX0, up 7.3% to $13.69, Solana (SOL) up 7% to $13.94, and Cosmos (ATOM) up 6.9% to $9.92.  Data from CoinGlass shows that traders who held short positions have faced immense liquidation pressure over the last 24 hours. In total, $119.51 million in positions have been liquidated, with 83% of them being shorts.  Meanwhile, Binance’s exchange token, BNB, is up 4% to $274.  Nansen data shows that the netflow to the exchange flipped positive during the last 24 hours to $715 million. During the Tuesday trading day outflow hit nearly $2 billion over regulatory concerns and news that the exchange was temporarily suspending USDC withdrawals.  Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, Binance founder and CEO, tweeted that he welcomes the “stress test” and suggested that all centralized exchanges should have similar regular tests. While the exchange doesn’t appear to have a liquidity problem at this time, CZ has warned staff to expect “turbulent times” ahead.

The utility has struggled to rebuild its business and reputation after, in 2011, an earthquake and tsunami struck nuclear reactors in Fukushima that it was operating without proper risk controls. In 2012, the government later bought a 50.1% stake in the company.  TEPCO formed a subsidiary called Agile Energy X aimed to create digital value out of the utility's excess power, including through cryptocurrency mining, in September. The two companies signed a memorandum of understanding with TRIPLE-1, a local hardware manufacturer to develop distributed data centers throughout the country that capitalize on excess renewable energy with TRIPLE-1's semiconductors, according to a Wednesday press release.  The aim of the project is to ""make effective use of surplus power"" by creating new demand for crypto mining and artificial intelligence computation, according to the press release.  The three companies have already set up a demo project in Tokyo: a 1.5 megawatt (MW) data center with 1,300 computers, which look very similar to mining rigs in a photo posted along with the press release.  Japan could be generating twice the amount of renewable energy its is producing today, Japan's Ministry of Energy said in a report published this year. That's because renewable energy curtailment has grown in recent years, meaning more energy goes unused, and it has been difficult to connect more renewable energy sources to the grid due to congestion, the companies said.  Despite the turbulence, TEPCO remains one of the largest utility companies in Japan, with a market cap of approximately 820 billion yen (US$6 billion), less than half what it was before the Fukushima disaster.

The move is part of a plan to modernize Australia’s financial system and comes in the wake of the FTX collapse that forced the management of its Australian entities to hand over control to licensed insolvency practitioners who independently assess the financial situation.  Developing appropriate custody and licensing settings to safeguard consumers will be part of the next steps the government takes, the announcement said.  ""Unfortunately, our regulatory architecture has not kept pace with changes in the market,"" said the joint release by Australia's Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services Stephen Jones. ""In many areas, the previous government sat on its hands. In other areas, it made announcements but didn’t deliver.""  Significantly, the government will assess which tokens or ""digital assets should be regulated by financial services laws"" as part of its ongoing ""token mapping"" work. In August, Australia's Treasury announced it would prioritize token mapping work, which involves uncovering the characteristics of all digital asset tokens in Australia including charting the type of crypto asset, its underlying code and any other defining technological feature.  The framework for the licensing and regulation of crypto service providers will be part of ""a strategic plan for the payments system"" of Australia set to be released in the first quarter of 2023 for which a consultation paper was released simultaneously. The consultation paper invites feedback till Feb. 6, 2023, and touches upon various aspects of the crypto eco system including digital wallets, stablecoins, crypto assets and central bank digital currencies.  This also includes exploring “the policy rationale for an Australian CBDC, including investigating the economic, legal, regulatory and technological considerations associated with an Australian CBDC.” Australia's central bank is expected to complete its CBDC pilot by mid-2023.  On Tuesday, news emerged that CEO Laura Mercurio departed Blockchain Australia, the nation's industry body advocating for appropriate regulation and policy. The Australian Financial Review reported that Mercurio left just weeks after her appointment in early September citing “differences of opinion” with the board.

42414740,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBJfIx,1671003238,"Bitcoin Could Drop to $10K-$12K by Q1 2023, VanEck Says","The outlook for risk assets appears bright after Tuesday's U.S. inflation report that affirmed the expected slowing of the Federal Reserve's liquidity tightening.  Bitcoin (BTC), however, could remain under pressure because several miners are likely to go bust, overshadowing improving macroeconomic conditions, according to investment giant VanEck.  ""Bitcoin will test $10,000-$12,000 in Q1 amid a wave of miner bankruptcies, which will mark the low point of the crypto winter,"" Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, said in the 2023 outlook.  This year, bitcoin miners, or those responsible for making coins, have been caught between rising operational costs and falling bitcoin prices.  Miners' profitability is closely tied to bitcoin's price, given they receive the cryptocurrency as a reward for solving complex mathematical puzzles to verify transactions on the blockchain. The rewards received are often liquidated to fund operational costs.  And so, when the price crashes, as it has this year by 61%, it leads to miner capitulation – a situation where weak miners exit the market, selling their reserves and causing the price to drop further. In a worst-case scenario, the capitulation could lead to a death spiral.  Miners have been running down their coin stash to cope with adverse market conditions. Data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shows balance held in miner wallets has declined by over 25,000 BTC (US$444 million) since July, hitting a 14-month low of 1.818 million BTC.  The trend could continue as most companies engaged in mining are bleeding cash.  ""The MVIS Global Digital Assets Mining Index median market cap is now only $180 [million], with nearly all constituents burning cash and trading well below book value. With bitcoin mining largely unprofitable, given recent higher electricity prices and lower bitcoin prices, we predict many miners will restructure or merge,"" Sigel wrote.  A drop to $12,000 would mean an 82% drawdown from the record high of $69,000 registered in November 2021. The previous two bear markets ran out of steam at roughly 85% drawdowns from the the-then record highs.  Sigel expects bitcoin to bounce back to $30,000 in the second half of 2023.  ""Lower inflation, easing energy concerns, a possible truce in Ukraine, and a turnaround in M2 supply will power the start of a new bull market,"" Sigel noted, adding that an oil-exporting nation would add the cryptocurrency to its sovereign wealth fund.  Other key forecasts  VanEck also expects financial institutions to tokenize more than $10 billion in off-chain assets and a new decentralized stablecoin to reach the $1 billion market cap.  The investment giant also sees Brazil becoming one of the most crypto-friendly countries of the world and tokenizing a portion of sovereign debt offerings on blockchain, Ripple losing the Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit in the U.S. and Ethereum enabling withdrawals from the Beacon Chain.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/14/bitcoin-could-drop-to-10k-12k-in-q1-2023-vaneck,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9174167d13e5410130d062b30b681fc37f5abdef-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price change in this period is 0.3172. The 24-hour low is $2.05, while the 24-hour high is $2.37. Despite the recent events in the crypto space, TON has enjoyed a positive price surge today, recording gains in a volatile crypto market. Related Reading: SEC Charges SBF Of Allegedly Conducting Fraud Schemes The trading volume is up by 40% at $66,552,790. According to CoinMarketCap, its market capitalization stands at $2,808,494,330. TON is currently ranked number 22 on the crypto market list showing massive investor attention. Its affiliation with Telegram has also helped the project to soar in popularity even if it has been rebranded. Although the TON coin is still some way off its all-time high value of $5.84, it has enjoyed a positive week and might close 2022 on a high note. What Is Behind Toncoin’s Price Gains? Toncoin is a decentralized blockchain (layer-1) built by the developers of the popular social messaging app Telegram. Toncoin utilizes a proof-of-stake mechanism which has increased its adoption time. This mechanism encourages investors to profit by staking their tokens for rewards rather than going through the rigors of mining. Toncoin price has seemingly surged due to investors rekindling their interest in the project. The Network uses sharding to operate its blockchains and is efficient and scalable. While the crypto winter has persisted and with the dip in bitcoin, investors are looking to diversify. Also, the general crypto market has seen little gains in the last two weeks despite investors’ fears. TON Likely To Sustain Its Rally TON’s support levels of 1.123 and 1.572 have been held. TON has broken through the resistance level of 1.835 with 2.998, the next level it will likely surpass. Overtaking the next resistance level will launch Toncoin into a full bull run. TON is currently trading above its 50-day and 200-day SMA. This shows that the assets’ short-term and long-term price movements are positive. The formation of long green candles on the chart’s right side indicates the bullish pressure. The RSI reading is firmly in the overbought region at 72.48, meaning the asset is giving off a strong buy signal for investors. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) is above its signal line and displays the positive price movement on the chart. TON will likely sustain this pressure and finish the year strong if the bulls don’t back out or a major market capitulation. Most crypto assets have fluctuated in the past weeks but are slowly beginning to show signs of life.

The company is racing to roll out a new line of mining machines to diversify from the less-reliable business of generating revenue from its own cryptocurrency mining. The bottom line was that BIT Mining lost $22.2 million in its latest quarter, marking a slight improvement from the $29.6 million loss a year earlier. The cryptocurrency miner announced a 10-for-1 reverse share split to avoid delisting, but faces a far larger threat from its dwindling cash reserves. What’s shrinking even more rapidly than bitcoin? At least one answer to that question is BIT Mining Ltd. ( BTCM ), one of many cryptocurrency companies minted in China over the last two years during better times when bitcoin was booming. Of course, just the opposite is true now, which has put many of these companies’ futures in doubt. Within that group, BIT Mining appears to be one of the most endangered. On Monday the company unveiled the latest step in its fight for survival, announcing a change in its American depositary share (ADS) ratio that equates to a 10-for-1 reverse share split. The move is relatively technical, designed to bring the stock above the $1 level to avoid delisting based on the New York Stock Exchange’s requirement that all stocks trade above $1. Based on its Monday closing price, the reverse split, which takes effect Dec. 23, would raise BIT Mining’s shares to $2.33, removing that delisting threat – at least for now. The stock fell 6% in after-hours trading after the announcement, indicating investors weren’t particularly impressed. At its current level, the company is valued at just under $25 million, a fraction of where it stood a year ago. The bigger backstory, of course, is the huge crash of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies this year. Bitcoin is reflective of the larger group, down about 64% this year. The crash has dragged down a few major companies so far, including the high-profile collapse of FTX ( FTX-USD ) last month. The much-larger field of smaller companies like BIT Mining are all facing big difficulties as well, since many were miners that used business models reliant on high cryptocurrency prices. At current prices, many of those business models no longer work, with the result that most of these companies are losing money and have had to halt much of their operations. The biggest problem right now for BIT Mining, and many of its peers, is simple survival, as most rapidly burn through their dwindling cash. BIT Mining has been working hard on that front, raising a combined $20 million in July and August through the sale of 50.1% of its stake in its Loto Interactive unit for HK$78 million ($10 million), and another $9.3 million through the sale of new shares at a heavy discount. Frankly speaking, we’re surprised the company could find any buyers at all for its new share issue, since BIT Mining could quite easily go out of business, which would make those shares worthless. A look at the company’s cash holdings shows how dire its situation is. Its cash and cash equivalents stood at $12.5 million at the end September, roughly half the $22.6 million it had three months earlier, according to its third-quarter earnings report released last month. But if we add in the $20 million it raised during the third quarter in July and August, it means the company burned through about $30 million in that three-month period. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to realize that BIT Mining’s remaining cash at the end of September would be insufficient to cover its costs through the end of the year at its current burn rate. Mining machine maker? BIT Mining is quite an older timer on China’s corporate business scene, with more than 20 years of history. It’s also a bit of a chameleon, spending most of its early years in the gambling business as a third-party online seller of tickets from China’s two state-operated lotteries. That business model went up in smoke around 2018 when China formally banned such third-party sales after several years of hinting at such a move. After looking for a new business model for several years, the company thought it had finally found a winner in late 2020 with the then-booming cryptocurrency market. It moved aggressively into the space as a cryptocurrency miner, and briefly saw its fortunes – and stock – soar. But all those gains have been wiped out in the current crash, with BIT Mining’s stock down 96% so far this year, making it among the worst performers in the group of related Chinese companies. In its latest pivot to stay in business, the company has announced plans to make crypto mining machines. Such business isn’t too much better than BIT Mining’s core business of earning money through its own crypto mining operations. But the economics still seem to work in terms of being able to make profits. A case in point is Canaan Inc. ( CAN ), which managed to remain profitable in the third quarter despite falling revenue. BIT Mining provided updates on several mining machines it is developing in its third-quarter earnings report, most being developed by its Bee Computing unit. The most advanced is a machine used to mine Doge (DOGE-USD) and Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) cryptocurrencies, with the company saying it expected to mass produce 3,300 of the machines in either December or January. The mining machine initiative probably explains the recent acceleration in the company’s cash burn rate, since new product development always requires big R&D spending. But the clock is clearly ticking down on BIT Mining to not only build the new machines, but also find buyers in the current depressed market. The company’s revenue, mostly derived from mining operations, plunged by about three-quarters to $97 million in the third quarter from $393 million a year earlier. It managed to slash its operating costs by a similar amount, dropping the figure to $113.6 million from $414.2 million a year earlier. The bottom line was that BIT Mining lost $22.2 million in its latest quarter, marking a slight improvement from the $29.6 million loss a year earlier. But a company burning through cash as rapidly as BIT Mining can hardly afford such losses. Its precarious situation is reflected in its current miniscule price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 0.01, which pales compared to Caanan’s 0.47 times and a 0.62 ratio for rival Chinese miner The9 ( NCTY ).

I believe the overperformance is justified given the daily active user growth and partnerships that Polygon has experienced. MATIC is required for transactions on the Polygon network and end users are now engaging with MATIC without realizing it. This is a big deal. Crypto bear and crypto bull, MATIC should have a phenomenal 2023 if its non-crypto partnerships continue to bear fruit. Before FTX (FTT-USD) collapsed in early to mid-November, many assets in the crypto market appeared to be setting up for favorable returns to end the year. Unfortunately for broad crypto bulls, FTX happened and 2022 is going to go down as one of the worst years for crypto investors since the industry really began with Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) arrival in 2009. If Bitcoin closes the year at the current $17,750 level, 2022 will be the second worst single year performance for Bitcoin since 2011 by both year over year decline (-62%) and decline from all-time high (-74%). This bear market cycle looks a bit different from previous ones, however. BTC & ETH Dominance (CoinMarketCap) We saw Bitcoin's crypto market dominance move from 32% during Ethereum's ( ETH-USD ) early January 2018 peak back up to over 50% during the depths of the 2019 crypto market bottom. Bitcoin's dominance continued to move higher as many altcoins from the ICO failed to regain all-time highs during the last bull run. Given the magnitude of the selloff in crypto to this point, Bitcoin's 38% market dominance now is very low compared to previous cycles. This time, assets other than Bitcoin have proven resilient in this current crypto winter cycle. Ethereum is notably stabilizing in the 18-20% market dominance range; ETH dominance figures that were previously indicators of peaks could now be transitioning to dominance bottoms if ETH is ever to flip BTC from a market dominance perspective. Even more impressive is Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) which is currently right near its dominance high of 0.9%. Polygon Dominance (CoinMarketCap) Polygon has shown remarkable resilience in this bear market and I believe MATIC is in a terrific position to be one of the best performing assets next year. In this article, I'll detail why Polygon is my top crypto pick for 2023. We'll look at what Polygon is, assess network adoption metrics, valuation compared to peers, coin supply dynamics, and major risks to consider. What is Polygon? I've previously covered Polygon for Seeking Alpha here and here and for BlockChain Reaction subscribers here . Simply put, Polygon is a proof-of-stake blockchain specifically designed to bring better scaling to Ethereum. Like other layer 1 blockchains, Ethereum suffers from the 'blockchain trilemma.' Blockchain Trilemma (Ledger) The trilemma theory suggests public blockchains can't achieve all three characteristics (decentralization, security, and scalability) independently. Ethereum is secure and decentralized but not scalable. Ethereum's scalability problem has led to the proliferation of other base layer blockchains that aim to offer better scalability through faster block times and more transactions per second. Other attempts at solving Ethereum's scalability drawback have come from building secondary ""Layer 2"" blockchains on top of Ethereum. This is the route Polygon has gone. Through Polygon, developers can get fast, cheap transactions that are secured with Ethereum's infrastructure. Anyone with an Ethereum wallet can use the Polygon network and interact with applications build on Polygon at a fraction of the cost associated with building on Ethereum. Rather than using ETH for gas fees, apps built on Polygon use MATIC for gas payment. These gas fees are so cheap per transaction that applications will often cover this cost for the end user - we'll explore this more momentarily. Partnerships In spite of crypto winter, Polygon has been building an impressive list of partnerships with some of the top companies in the world. Polygon has been chosen as a public blockchain tool by Starbucks ( SBUX ), Meta Platforms ( META ), Stripe , and Reddit . Additionally, Polygon was the only blockchain scaling protocol that was granted presence in Disney's ( DIS ) accelerator program earlier this year . Starbucks is using Polygon to launch its new rewards platform, Starbucks Odyssey. While that platform is still in beta, demand for the product has reportedly been 'unprecedented.' It seems to work like most other rewards programs. The more a consumer engages with the product or service, Starbucks in this case, the more that consumer will generate rewards that can be redeemed for additional perks and benefits as a Starbucks customer. According to a recent Digiday piece , the crypto natives aren't the only ones paying attention to how Starbuck's NFT project performs: Marketers and industry observers say they are watching the rollout of the program as it could be a bellwether for how much consumers are willing to care about branded NFTs. Starbucks Odyssey isn't live for the entire market yet, that comes next year. But if it's received as well as Reddit's Avatar Collectibles project has been, Polygon figures to onboard several million more non-crypto native users to the crypto ecosystem very shortly. Reddit Avatar Collectibles The biggest issue facing broader crypto adoption may not be regulatory clarity, institutional demand, or approval of ETFs. In my view, public blockchain gets to the next level when people are interacting with crypto rails without realizing it. We're already beginning to see that with Polygon. Just about every crypto network has experienced drastic daily user declines since the Terra (LUNC-USD) collapse in May and June. Polygon has been a notable exception. This is in large part because people are indirectly buying MATIC without realizing it. Reddit NFT Unique Holders (Dune Analytics/Polygon) Reddit launched its Avatar Collectible NFT initiative back in July. Since then, the project has produced over 5 million collectible avatars; 3.9 million of which are from unique holders. According to Polygon, just 6.8% of the Reddit avatar holders have more than 1 avatar. This implies an impressive acceptance of the avatars by the Reddit community. Notable given the pushback regarding NFTs from certain communities earlier this year. NFTs have a bit of a stigma at the moment. The first thing that probably pops into the mind of the casual crypto spectator when they see the acronym ""NFT"" might be Bored Ape Yacht Club or Crypto Punks. The acronym is associated with people dropping silly amounts of money on JPEGs. This has led to rejection from some who see NFTs as nothing more than yet another tulip mania. Ubisoft (UBSFY) and Discord (DSCD) both infamously dialed back their plans to launch NFT projects after pushback from the gamer community. So how did Reddit pull this off? Simple. The NFTs weren't called NFTs. They were called ""Digital Collectibles."" This is what Reddit CEO Steve Huffman told The Verge in August: We try really hard not to use any crypto words — it just confuses people. The ecosystem is so confusing. I can’t figure out half this stuff. By covering gas fees as part of the out the door product cost and being very careful to avoid any crypto-related words, Reddit has proven a very valuable case study in both NFT and crypto adoption. It's just avatar pictures and other collectible NFTs today. But in the future, it'll be much more than that; digital assets like usernames, websites domains, and content itself can theoretically live on scalable public blockchains like Polygon. Network Activity The Reddit project has provided a noticeable uptick in daily active users on the Polygon blockchain. There was actually a two week period in October when Polygon was averaging more DAUs than Ethereum was. That average has come off that high a bit and the chain is now averaging a little under 335k DAUs: DAUs & Developers (TokenTerminal) This level of activity has helped Polygon's network stabilize in the 2-3 million daily transaction range despite the large declines in crypto-related transactions seen in other networks. Daily Transactions (Polygonscan.com) Polygon has had stable network engagement for all of 2022 even while numerous crypto-collapses have put a tremendous amount of pressure on the industry broadly, especially in NFTs. Price to Fees Valuation Valuing blockchains is a bit different from valuing traditional equities. Because the crypto industry is still so new, there isn't really a set of standards for valuing a network's token. This is especially true because crypto networks don't necessarily serve the same kind of transaction demand. When it comes to something like payments, NVT or the network value to transactions ratio, is a solid fundamental metric to consider. But for smart contracts, price to fees is of interest as well. It slightly mimics a price to sales ratio as it divides the fully diluted coin market cap by the annualized transaction fees on the network. When your network is all about cheap fees, this can create extremely elevated P/F ratios. P/F Ratio comparison (Token Terminal) Even though Polygon's gas fees are less than a penny per transaction, the high P/F ratio issues isn't really the case. Currently, the P/F ratio for Polygon is 540. This is higher than chains like Binance ( BNB-USD ) or Ethereum but much lower than other low-fee blockchains like Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ), Near Protocol ( NEAR-USD ), Cardano ( ADA-USD ), or Cosmos ( ATOM-USD ). When we look at the metric over time, we can see that Polygon has been growing into its P/F valuation: Polygon P/F Trend (Token Terminal) Back in July of 2021, the price of MATIC was at a very similar level to where it is now but the P/F multiple was roughly 5x higher than it is today. This shows network growth of Polygon that is outpacing the growth of the MATIC token price. Token Supply For Polygon, the network growth story becomes very interesting when we assess the supply/demand mechanics of the token. Many Layer 1 blockchains, Ethereum included, don't have a coin supply cap. Polygon is one that does: Tokens in circulation: 8.7 billion Max token supply: 10 billion Circulating supply: 87% MATIC Supply schedule (Messari/Polygon) All of the MATIC tokens will be in the circulating supply by mid-2025. Since the tokens are required for transactions on-chain whether the end user is aware of it or not, as the network grows there will always be an organic bid for MATIC as the key utility token on the network. With a token supply cap fast approaching, network demand should move the price of MATIC much higher. Risks As with any investment in crypto, Polygon carries significant regulatory risk in the United States. The market still requires clarity on if MATIC would be considered a synthetic commodity, currency, or a security. I will not attempt to handicap how the federal government views MATIC but in my opinion it would probably negatively impact the price of the coin to a larger degree if the SEC gets regulatory oversight of Polygon. There is also risk broadly speaking because digital assets are inherently riskier than traditional investments like equities or bonds. There is also macro risk to consider. Until proven otherwise, the ""fed pivot"" narrative, to which I absolutely subscribe, is still just a thesis and has not yet happened. Additionally, even if the Fed pivots it may not be enough to bring more liquidity into the crypto ecosystem. I think Polygon is more reliant on the success of NFT initiatives from key brand partners like Starbucks, Meta, and Reddit than it is on the central banks. There is no guarantee that Starbucks or any other partner will have the product success that was seen with Reddit's Avatar Collectibles. There is also no guarantee that these kinds of products will all be built with public blockchains. Summary Polygon has been one of the better performing crypto assets this year. In mid-June following the Terra/Celsius (CEL-USD) drama, the MATIC token hit $0.32 when crypto crashed. It is now up almost 200% since the June low and continues to on-board new users who are not crypto native. Polygon is working with several major brands on key growth initiatives. There is no guarantee any of these initiatives bear fruit for Polygon or its partners. But given the pedigree of Polygon's partners, I can't think of a crypto-native asset that is in a better position to bring new blood to crypto rails in 2023. All that said, I don't think we've seen the bottom yet in certain crypto assets. Frankly, I believe there are several crypto coins in the top 20-25 by market rank that will not last another 2 years. Polygon is different. As Reddit has shown us this year, the end user doesn't necessarily even know they are using crypto when they engage with some of the products that are built with Polygon. This is a massive factor in my view. Even if crypto as an investment category falls apart in 2023, I believe the case can be made that MATIC will hold up just fine provided the network continues to onboard non-crypto natives through new product offerings from companies like Starbucks. If crypto doesn't fall apart in 2023, MATIC will probably do even better.

42414747,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBJfjU,1670976092,First Mover Asia: Busan as Blockchain Hub? The Korean City Is Traveling the Wrong Path; No Bail for Bankman-Fried,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and other cryptos liked the sound of inflation slowing by more than expected in November.  Insights: The South Korean city of Busan wants to be a blockchain hub, but it is forgetting a few inconvenient truths.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 885.54 +21.7 ▲ 2.5% Bitcoin (BTC) $17,765 +554.0 ▲ 3.2% Ethereum (ETH) $1,319 +43.8 ▲ 3.4% S&P 500 daily close  4,019.65 +29.1 ▲ 0.7% Gold  $1,822 +41.2 ▲ 2.3% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.5% ▼ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Inflation Slows, Bitcoin Accelerates  By James Rubin  Former FTX boss and crypto wunderkind Sam Bankman-Fried went to a Bahamian jail, was denied bail and verbally pummeled at a congressional hearing by the executive who replaced him as the exchange's CEO.  Binance saw a torrent of withdrawals hours after a report that U.S. prosecutors were considering criminal charges against the exchange. Shares of crypto-friendly bank Silvergate plummeted to a two-year low.  The digital asset industry had a memorable 24 hours, though not for the reasons it would prefer.  Yet, crypto markets only had eyes for encouraging inflation figures from November.  Bitcoin was recently trading at $17,765, a 3.2% gain over the past 24 hours, as investors embraced the latest consumer price index (CPI) data, which showed prices rising 7.1%, lower than the 7.3% projected by economists responding to a FactSet survey. The CPI soared over 9% earlier this year.  “It’s pretty clear that the back of inflation has been broken,"" Jacob Sansbury, co-founder and CEO of Pluto, a provider of DIY automated investing services for retail investors, wrote to CoinDesk. After all, CPI prints are trailing indicators.""  Sansbury added: ""This is an auspicious sign for bitcoin and crypto, along with other risk assets. I’m not saying that a bottom has formed yet fully for the crypto market, but from today’s lower-than-expected CPI print, it’s pretty clear that a bottom is very, very close.""  Ether was recently changing hands at $1,319, also up 3.4% from Monday, same time. Most other major cryptos had a solid green hue with AVAX, the token of base layer network Avalanche, and LINK, the token of software platform, Chainlink recently rising 5.8% and 3.2%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently climbed nearly 2.4%.  U.S. equity indexes embraced the encouraging CPI figures more quietly as the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 climbed 1% and 0.7%, respectively. The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday also showed core inflation, which excludes more volatile food and fuel costs, increasing 6% versus expectations of 6.2% and offered additional evidence that the U.S. central bank's monetary hawkishness during the past six months has been working.  U.S. Treasury yields, which hovered above 4% just a few months ago, sank to 3.5% on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Fed is likely to raise the interest rate 50 basis points (bps), a decline from its streak of four straight 75 bps increases.  Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried was remanded to custody and will face an extradition hearing on Feb. 8, 2023. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York unsealed the indictment earlier on Tuesday, announcing that officials were charging Bankman-Fried with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and campaign violation allegations, among other alleged crimes. FTX collapsed last month after CoinDesk found irregularities in its balance sheet.  In a Tweet on Tuesday, Binance founder and CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao wrote that he welcomed a “stress test” of withdrawals on his exchange to address rising user redemption requests from the platform.  Of cryptos' Tuesday price surge, Bob Ras, co-founder of exchange and digital asset ecosystem Sologenic, noted cautiously in an email to CoinDesk that the bounce was not ""as substantial as many had hoped for.""  ""This isn’t to say there won’t be more upside for major crypto assets here soon. It’s certainly possible, if not likely,"" he wrote, adding that the emergence of China from its Covid lockdowns, could affect inflation in the months ahead.  ""There’s just too much uncertainty for a full-blown market breakout for crypto assets and equities that are further along the risk curve,” he wrote.

But will anyone care about its government enterprise blockchain initiatives and quest to build the first city-run crypto exchange?  Part of Busan’s status as the ""center of a global digital information ecosystem,"" as government literature describes it, is to integrate blockchain technology into all facets of government service. That means, according to The Korea Herald, that blockchain will be the technology that powers the city’s blockchain-based ID service called B-Pass, B-Fresh, its seafood logistics service, B-Tour, a tour platform, to name a few.  The problem is this initiative represents yesterday’s thinking on blockchain. Others have tried integrating permissioned enterprise blockchain into digital infrastructure, and it has failed. A few weeks ago, CoinDesk reported that two major enterprise blockchain projects were ending: Shipping giant Maersk and IBM abandoned TradeLens, a blockchain solution for optimizing supply chains, while the Australian Stock Exchange said it was abandoning a blockchain-powered clearing and settlement system because of a poor cost-benefit ratio.  “It’s a Web2 business model, but a little bit of Web3 pixie dust sprinkled on. And once the pixie dust kind of wears off, the value proposition doesn’t look so hot,” Paul Brody, head of blockchain at global consulting giant Ernst & Young, told CoinDesk in a previous article.  This is on top of IBM’s blockchain team being effectively wound down in early 2021, and Microsoft discontinuing its Azure cloud services for blockchain a few months later.  It isn’t exactly clear how the powers that be in Busan will do anything differently that could change the equation on enterprise blockchain. It’s probably that they can’t.  Blockchain remains slow  The reason why there hasn’t been a success story in this field is that the technology itself is slow compared to other database platforms.  “The problem was the cost in computing power to implement. Blockchain technology is slow and requires a great deal more computer power. Blockchain is the Model T of distributed ledger technology. They are amazing but now dated,” explained Burke Files, a consultant, when asked about why the U.S. Food and Drug Administration isn’t implementing blockchain technology as it once claimed.  Busan’s other blockchain venture is the creation of a government-run crypto exchange. In a recent announcement from the city, authorities said that the project had some setbacks, but its still on track for a launch next year.  Setbacks indeed. FTX was an early contractor on the project, but that’s obviously not going to work now that the exchange has collapsed and the former CEO has been arrested.  Binance and Huobi are also involved, but there’s been little to show for what should be a very simple project.  Even if it's built, will anyone want to use it? There will certainly be benefits for traders when it comes to Korean won on-ramps and expedited know-your-customer procedures. But will people be comfortable trading on a government-run platform? It’s a fiat exchange, and many will no doubt find it antithetical to Satoshi’s vision for crypto.  Busan might also be opening itself to some major headaches via liabilities.  What if the exchange is hacked? Or what if a listed token is the victim of a rug pull? When dealing with offshore exchanges this can add a level of complexity, but serving the city of Busan with a legal notice will be a lot easier for a Korean lawyer then tracking down an exchange that’s registered in Seychelles but has no central office.  Of course, the whole thing could be a Potemkin Village designed to look like busy work and extract dollars from tax payers. When CoinDesk visited the Busan blockchain center in August, it was just a co-working space with a handful of people. Hardly indicative of the makings of a global technology hub.
