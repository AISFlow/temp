42400033,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzRob,1497641416,In the Green: Cryptocurrency Prices Rebound After Market Correction,"Cryptocurrency prices rebounded today, reversing the price declines seen during this week's broad correction.  This rebound was seen across many different markets, with more than 90 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies seeing higher prices in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.  This broad rally coincided with the market capitalization (market cap) of cryptocurrencies reaching $107.7bn today, a roughly 17.5% increase over the prior day’s low of $91.3bn, additional CoinMarketCap figures show.  The wider cryptocurrency market saw a notable correction earlier in the week, with its collective market cap falling by more than 20% after reaching an all-time high of $117.2bn on 12th June. This stood in contrast to the significant inflows seen over the past few months, as the total cryptocurrency market cap has risen more than 500% year-to-date as of press time.  The sharp appreciation motivated some analysts to warn that the cryptocurrency market may have entered bubble territory.

South Korean publication Seoul Economic Daily reports that the cache of bitcoins – worth roughly $540,000 at press time – was seized during a cyber investigation operation by the South Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency, which arrested a 33-year-old individual in April for operating an obscenity website. It's the first auction of its kind.  According to the Korea Asset Management Corporation (KAMCO), the country's asset management operation that oversees state-owned properties and development, any seized financial assets including digital currencies became government properties, subject to public auctions.  It is anticipated that the final bid could be slightly lower than the market price, which is currently at approximately $2,525, according to CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. KAMCO told the publication that 3% of the sales will be returned to the South Korean government.  The auction comes amid a boom in South Korea's local cryptocurrency market.  Domestic exchange platforms like Bithumb, Korbit and Coinone have seen significant increases in trade volume in recent months According to data from CoinMarketCap, the Korean won is currently contributing to 32.26 per cent of the trading volume of ethers, the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network.

42400030,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzRle,1497619825,Europe's IT Systems Agency Explores Blockchain At Industry Roundtable,"An EU agency focused on the interoperability of IT systems discussed blockchain during a recent industry event.  Eu-LISA, formed in 2013 to help members of the European Union share information across borders, held a roundtable on 8th June that saw the agency hear from a group of companies about their work on interoperability.  It's a subject that invoked blockchain and, while it seems like eu-LISA isn't doing much more than gathering information right now, it's a noteworthy development given the agency's role in connecting information systems across the EU.  The agency said in a release:  ""Accenture, SAP, Guardtime, Augmentiq and SAS all provided interesting input in their presentations, recounting experiences related to implementation of interoperability elsewhere, considering the potential architectures for interoperable systems including blockchain technology and considering questions of data quality and analytics.""  The development comes amidst a widening effort within the EU to explore potential applications for blockchain as it relates to the management and oversight of the economic bloc.  The European Commission is actively funding research in this area, committing €500k in April to back a pilot project that creates a so-called 'observatory' through which officials and member state representatives can share information.  At the same time, EU officials have spent much of the past year advocating for stronger oversight of digital currency activities due to fears over the pseudonymous nature of the tech.

42400014,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzRYr,1497617107,Bitcoin Scaling Proposal Segwit2x Moves Ahead With Initial Code Release,"The working group behind the Segwit2x bitcoin scaling proposal has announced that the first version of its code is now ready for review and testing.  As such, the release provides the market with a first look at the technology underlying one of the most broadly supported bids to enhance the network. Announced in May as an ""agreement"" that united miners and startups, Segwit2x is an alternative technology roadmap to one proposed by Bitcoin Core, the network's open-source developer group.  It has since emerged as a frequent subject of praise, criticism and discussion.  However, in what could be a promising sign, Segwit2x could become a moderate option that helps to avoid a contentious network split, and it looks like it could end up being somewhat compatible with an alternative proposal, the user-activated soft fork (UASF) BIP 148, which, as coded, will activate on 1st August.  The news is notable because earlier this week any compatibility between the two proposals seemed less likely – a discordance that raised fears of a split of the blockchain into two competing assets.  The development became apparent on Wednesday, when bitcoin developer James Hilliard submitted a change request, along with a code change that would reduce the time it takes for mining pools to lock in the update.  On GitHub, Hilliard said:  ""This should reduce the chance of a conflict with BIP 148.""    By reducing that time, mining pools will have one (or maybe two) three-day periods in which they can lock-in a controversial code change called Segregated Witness (SegWit) by signaling support using the SegWit2x software before the UASF occurs on August 1st. Though, it's unclear if mining pools will decide to do so.    The request was well-received, being met with several 'ACKs' – developer shorthand for 'agreed', and a sign of approval.  Firmer timelines  The alpha release of SegWit2x includes a working version of the software, which combines two changes, the scaling optimization SegWit and an increased 2MB block-size parameter.  The increase to 2MB is now scheduled for three months after SegWit activates, according to an email from BitGo CEO Mike Belshe. Prior to this, it's been less clear (even to some SegWit2x participants) when the 2MB hard fork would take place.  ""Segwit2x development has been moving quickly according to plan, and the project is in good shape,"" Belshe said, in the message to the working group.  The 2MB block size has long been a point of contention, partially because it could lead to a blockchain split if not everyone agrees to upgrade to the new blockchain code. Further, some in the industry have already suggested they don't plan to.  However, SegWit2x has won the support of most major bitcoin companies and mining firms, in total representing over 80% of bitcoin's hash rate. (Though it remains unclear how reliable this support will be owing partly to fatigue around the issue).  With the alpha version out, the wider community now gets to review and test the software. The release also includes a new bitcoin testnet that developers can use to put the software through its paces and identify any bugs.  Testing phase  Developers can trial the software using the new test network, called testnet5, for the next two weeks.  ""We are planning to conduct rounds of testing against the new testnet5 including everyone from the working group who would like to participate,"" BitPay senior developer Justin Langston said in another email to the working group.  The plan for these rounds is to simulate the code's deployment lifecycle, from signaling support for SegWit to activating the 2MB block-size parameter.  These rounds of testing and review are aimed to help avoid any future network problems, such as, in a worst-case scenario, the loss of users' bitcoin.  In the email, Langston wrote:  ""My perspective is limited. We need your feedback on what tests would be essential for your company to adequately assess applicable risks and be prepared to deploy on livenet, signaling accordingly, when the time comes.""  Security loose ends?  Feedback on SegWit2x's plan has already been rolling in.  One working group participant argued there is potential for 'replay attacks' in the event of a hard fork. Replay attacks, in the event of a split leaving the community with two bitcoin tokens, could allow users to accidentally spend their bitcoin on both networks.  This confusion happened last summer when ethereum split into two coins, leading some companies to lose money.  The participant argued that protection from this confusing and potentially dangerous issue is needed within Segwit2x's code.  Some Bitcoin Core developers have also criticized Segwit2x's development timeline as being too short, because it often takes a significant amount of time to catch all errors associated with bitcoin code changes. SegWit itself was tested for over a year before it was launched.  So far, though, SegWit2x developers haven't skipped a beat, saying the project will continue to move forward along the original timeline, with the beta release scheduled for 30th June. On 21st July, users will be able to run and signal the fully vetted software, according to the group.

42400027,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzRkf,1497614443,Initial Coin Offerings: Where the SEC Might Stand,"Benjamin Sauter and David McGill of Kobre & Kim LLP and Brian Klein of Baker Marquart LLP are civil litigators and criminal and regulatory defense attorneys. They are also part of the Digital Currency & Ledger Defense Coalition, a group of over 50 lawyers dedicated to protecting US blockchain innovators.  In this opinion piece, the three attorneys ask if purveyors of initial coin offerings (ICOs) should fear the long arm of US law, citing a recent SEC decision that suggests the answer is yes.      With the market for ICOs red hot, everyone in the blockchain space seems to be asking: ""What does the SEC think about all this?""  While there's no direct answer, a recent statement by the head of the SEC's blockchain task force provides one clue. At CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference in New York, Valerie Szczepanik unofficially said that those involved in ICOs must protect investors, including by fully disclosing associated risks.  Another recent and relatively unheralded federal case in Utah, SEC vs Traffic Monsoon, reveals further clues. The case provides a potential roadmap for aggressive SEC enforcement and private class-action claims involving ICOs. (We'll look at it in more detail below.)  Blockchain professionals should closely monitor how case law develops in this area and factor it into ICO plans.  ICOs: A quick background  ICOs have exploded in popularity, in large part because they allow less-established companies to raise funds outside of traditional investment channels. They do not fit neatly within any previous fundraising paradigms. They come in all shapes and sizes.  A 'typical' ICO involves a company proposing a project to potential supporters, who then acquire (through investment, donation or otherwise) an amount of the company’s own proprietary digital currency or token.  ICOs have been wildly successful as of late. Bancor raised nearly $150m earlier this week for its Bancor Network Tokens, while web browser maker Brave recently raised $35m in less than a minute for its Basic Attention Tokens (BAT).  For better or worse, digital currency’s relatively novel nature and unprecedented success is attracting significant scrutiny, including by regulators like the SEC.  SEC vs Traffic Monsoon  The Traffic Monsoon case – which does not involve an ICO, but involves what is arguably an analogous offering – is instructive for how the SEC may approach ICO enforcement.  In March 2017, a federal court in Utah authorized the SEC to proceed with an enforcement action against the Utah-based internet advertising company Traffic Monsoon. In the SEC’s complaint, it alleged that Traffic Monsoon was orchestrating a Ponzi scheme in violation of US securities laws by inducing its 'members' to purchase 'AdPacks' (a product that promised a certain number of visits to their websites) in exchange for a share in the company’s future revenues.  Traffic Monsoon countered that its AdPacks were not 'securities' under US law and that its sales were beyond the reach of US securities laws (and the SEC) because approximately 90% of sales took place abroad.  The presiding federal court disagreed with Traffic Monsoon, finding that the AdPacks were securities and that the SEC could enforce US securities laws as long as the foreign sales had a substantial effect in the US.  Acknowledging both the importance and the novelty of its decision, the court certified the decision for immediate appeal. The appeal process is expected to unfold over the coming months.  Traffic Monsoon's significance  The court's decision in Traffic Monsoon is significant for four reasons:  How it defined a 'security'  What it said about the SEC’s territorial reach  How it may facilitate future class actions  What it said constitutes a Ponzi scheme.  1. The definition of a 'security'  Traffic Monsoon has strong relevance for the ICO market because it defined a 'security' in a manner that arguably encompasses at least some ICO offerings. The court, ruling in the SEC's favor, decided that AdPacks constituted a security subject to the US securities laws, reasoning:  The 'economic reality' of the AdPack purchases was more similar to an investment than a purchase of a service, because demand was ""driven by members purchasing and repurchasing AdPacks in order to obtain the incredible returns on their investment, not by intense demand for Traffic Monsoon’s services"".  The returns from the AdPacks came ""solely from the efforts of others"", despite the fact that investors were required to personally visit other websites to participate in revenue sharing.  This opens the door for the SEC to classify a new digital currency or token as a 'security'. And it may signal that courts will look beyond mere nomenclature in reviewing that classification. If the underlying economic substance of the ICO looks or feels like an investment, simply calling it by another name (for example, a 'donation', 'presale' or 'crowdsale') may not carry the day.  Likewise, the SEC may deem an ICO to be a security issuance, even if those acquiring the new coin or token have some ongoing role in the organization.  2. The SEC's expansive reach  The court's decision in Traffic Monsoon broke new ground on the question of the SEC's territorial reach.  The court held that the company's foreign sales were subject to an enforcement action because ""significant steps in furtherance of the violation"" had occurred in the US. The court specifically observed that Traffic Monsoon was conceived and promoted by persons located in the US.  This holding may foreshadow expanded SEC (or US Department of Justice) authority to bring enforcement claims even when securities transactions occur entirely outside of the US.  Companies engaging in ICOs need to carefully understand the likely impact of their issuances in the US and how they market or sell the new coins or tokens.  3. Class actions and ICOs  The Traffic Monsoon case may open the door to private claims by disgruntled non-US investors.  Ordinarily, private individuals may bring US securities claims only if the security is listed on a US stock exchange, or if the purchase or sale of the security occurred within the US. The court found that this standard was met because Traffic Monsoon was a Utah company, and thus even AdPack sales to foreign individuals over the internet were ""domestic transactions"".  Disgruntled foreign investors may well invoke this part of the decision to sustain private claims in US courts. And given the limited resources available to the SEC's enforcement division, this may turn out to be the most significant risk arising from the decision.  4. The contours of a Ponzi scheme    The court also held that Traffic Monsoon's AdPack investment arrangement constituted a Ponzi scheme. This is because, at bottom, the ""returns [were] not based upon any underlying business activity"", and instead ""money from new investors [was] used to pay earlier investors"".  Additionally, the court noted that a Ponzi scheme exists when investor profits ""are not created by the success of the underlying business venture but instead are derived from the capital contributions of subsequently attracted investors"".  As a result, the court ordered the seizure of all of the company's funds and enjoined the company from collecting further payments.  If applied more broadly, this holding could have implications for, among others, early-stage entrepreneurs raising successive funding rounds. In an environment where at least a few high-profile ICOs have been publicly condemned as Ponzi schemes, companies and investors should be aware of the broad and often vague contours of a Ponzi scheme under US securities laws.  Conclusion  To date, the ICO regulatory compliance discussion has focused on whether the newly issued coins or tokens are securities subject to the SEC's jurisdiction.  The Traffic Monsoon decision is a potentially significant development that warrants close attention, particularly in conjunction with Szczepanik's warning about protecting investors.

42400012,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzRWt,1497603609,"As Crypto Markets See Slowing Growth, Traders Look Long","In the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency markets, it can be easy to get caught up in small price fluctuations.  However, advocates of the technology have advice for those who may have had their interest sparked by the combined market's meteoric rise above $100bn this year. Amidst a broader pullback in cryptocurrencies, investors can benefit from focusing on the technology's long-term trajectory, analysts say.  Iqbal Gandham, managing director at eToro, told CoinDesk:  ""If you believe that bitcoin is the future of money, and that ethereum is the future of the internet, then you should be investing in the long term.""  Gandham is certainly not the only market observer who advocated long-term investing instead of short-term trading. Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, offered similar input.  Accurately predicting what the markets will do in the short term is very difficult, he told CoinDesk, and attempts to time the market are ""not for most of us"".  Eliosoff emphasized that while he has been expecting a pullback in certain cryptocurrencies, he is bullish on the asset class in the long-term.  Ether's appeal  That doesn't mean those involved don't have theories about where the best long bets can be placed.  As noted by CoinDesk earlier this week, ether, currently the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been catching up with bitcoin in terms of its total market value. At the time of the report, ether's market cap was more than 80% of bitcoin's, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  As such, traders like Whaleclub's Petar Zivkovski suggested those who are new to the markets should do their best to internalize ongoing narratives while attempting to understand the value propositions of any coin.  ""Ether has also become a true contender over the past few months when it comes to market cap,"" Zivkovski told CoinDesk.  One result of this large market cap is greater liquidity, which has in turn reduced the currency's volatility and made it more appealing relative to many other alternative asset protocols.  Big sell-off?  Of course, looking long is easier said than done given the nascent nature of cryptocurrencies.  For example, bitcoin's ongoing scaling debate appears to be intensifying, heightening trader sensitivity over fears the network could fork. Arthur Hayes, CEO of Hong Kong-based exchange BitMEX, for instance, sees this situation as one that could be ""bad news"" for the market as a whole.  ""With the 1st August UASF deadline approaching, I believe we will be range bound. There is a lot of uncertainty amongst traders about the event,"" he said.  Eliosoff also spoke to bitcoin's scaling challenges, describing the tensions that exist within the bitcoin community as ""worse than ever"" given that efforts like UASF could lead to a blockchain split. He explained how these difficulties have made other assets – particularly ether – even more attractive.  ""Given those deep hostilities in bitcoin, if I could only hold one coin right now it would be ether – even at these prices,"" he remarked.  Still, in this light, eToro's Gandham noted that the small dips in the price of assets like ether are perhaps best viewed in context, concluding:  ""Whilst the recent drop in the price may look like a crash ... it’s more accurately viewed as a bump in the road.""
