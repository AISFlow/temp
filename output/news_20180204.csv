42401005,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLZt2,1517739619,Why Crypto Is Spreading Up the Dublin Coast,"Symptomatic of a broader shift internationally, the crypto landscape in Dublin has changed rapidly, and with an enthusiasm perhaps disproportionate to the city's scale.  Suddenly perforated with meetups, ICO startups, crypto cafes, bitcoin merchandise and trading chatter in pubs, cryptocurrencies have seemingly taken the city by storm – and Reuben Godfrey, co-founder of local incubator Crypto Coast reckons this momentum will only continue.  Toward this, he's planted an office on the pier of coastal suburb Dun Laoghaire, in a venture that he hopes to spread all along the east coast of Ireland, and to many other ports in the world as well.  ""We'll look at Boston, Barcelona, Moscow, Kiev, where else are we talking to, Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, Lucerne in Switzerland, you know, stick a name on the map,"" Godfrey told CoinDesk.  Following a wave of blockchain hubs that have emerged internationally, the Crypto Coast hopes to connect local industry workers, while attracting international businesses and investment.  And in the few days since its launch, it's already attracted some international players, Russia and U.S.-based startups Coinfideal and Rewards Token, drawing some students and researchers in the process.  Godfrey said:  ""We're just providing a dance floor for people to come up and do whatever they want on basically.""  And while it's facing competition from established blockchain hubs internationally (as well as Europe’s more traditional startup centers like London and Berlin), Reuben reckons Ireland has an advantage.  ""As a place to do business, Ireland is absolutely world class. We've some of the best brains I've ever come across. And for sparky, innovative stuff that we need to be doing with blockchain, there could be nowhere better. I am absolutely adamant about that,"" Godfrey said.  Down the line, Crypto Coast even hopes to launch its own local cryptocurrency, potentially a token that buys up distressed property in order to ""deflate the housing crises usually made worse by tech hubs.""  That's the ""next phase,"" Godfrey told CoinDesk.  Local adoption  Stepping back, Godfrey is no stranger to the space. He set up the Blockchain Association of Ireland back in 2015, which has since been home to many meetups, as well as forging the early stages of Dublin's crypto community.  While such efforts were successful, sometimes drawing as many as an estimated 100 people, he acknowledges the city has changed, and that is has developed a bigger appetite for crypto. Blockchain meetups were faced with increasingly long waiting lists, with attendees spilling out into the hundreds.  ""I think people are just ripe, ready to trust in it,"" Godfrey said, pointing to how quickly Ireland adapted the euro when the national currency changed in 1999. ""It was instant, it didn't take long, we got the concept.""  Adding to this, Godfrey said that the shift in public interest has to do with an increasing number of people engaged in cryptocurrency trading.  ""We're also obviously a nation of gamblers,"" Godfrey laughed, adding, ""If that's what converts a big percentage of Irish people into it, that's fine.""  But to cope with this, the community needed to expand out of obscurity, and crucially for Godfrey, into something more friendly and accessible to the broader public. This led to the creation of Crypto AM, a Saturday morning meetup at the Crypto Coast that's engineered to have a broader appeal.  ""[We need a] far more accessible entry point for people to get involved, to ask questions, to hear about the bigger concepts and understand a bit more about crypto,"" Godfrey said,  ""And the more you get into it, the more you realize it's not about making money, it's about changing it,"" he added.  Clunky bits of symbolism  Part of a broader venture named Harbour Innovation Labs that hopes to supply working space for up to a thousand people, the Crypto Coast is situated on the site of an old ferry terminal.  ""The space it pretty much ticks all the ICO boxes, in another universe it would be used by a Bond villain, you know, a secret lair,"" Godfrey said.  And for Godfrey, this particular Dublin suburb is rich in symbolic value.  ""There's a few clunky bits of symbolism about it. Those are important for me as well, or certainly part of what made me think it was possible to do something here,"" Godfrey said.  He stated that, as a town, Dun Laoghaire owes itself to the industrial revolution, and the invention of the railroad along the Dublin coastline. ""Dun Laoghaire train station was the first ever commuter rail station in the world,"" Godfrey said.  As such, according to Godfrey, there's no better site for Ireland to become leaders in the cryptocurrency revolution, telling CoinDesk, ""If it happened once, then why not again?""  And there's another, more melancholic resonance at the site of the ferry terminal as well.  ""We're on the ferry terminal where tens of thousands of Irish people left during the '80s, got on the boat and never came back, went over to Britain and never came back."" Godfrey said.  And while emigration has reduced in recent years, it's still the highest in Europe, with over a quarter of a million leaving since 2008.  ""I’m absolutely sick to death of it."" Godfrey said.  In that, Godfrey hopes the venture will play a part in decreasing those numbers, as well as possibly encouraging those who have left to return to familiar shores.  He concluded:  ""I want to have a place [where] instead of having to seek out meetups, you can stand up from your desk and have a workshop... A safe space for crypto people.""

42401002,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLZr4,1517737537,"The Decentralized Web Just Might Need Databases, Too","There's a gap in the vision for the decentralized internet.  At least that's according to Bluzelle, which recently raised $19.5 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) aimed at creating a network of decentralized online databases.  While several companies, including Filecoin and Storj, are already working on decentralized file storage, Bluzelle is targeting the databases that keep data quickly and easily accessible for websites and applications to pull from.  These databases make the internet more useful for interactive tasks, such as updating weather and stock prices. And Bluzelelle wants to bring that flexibility to the decentralized web, which is currently as slow as molasses.  So-called structured data gives websites and apps faster access to data they can read, change and be updated externally. And following the interest by investors to fund what they call ""protocol tokens,"" there seems to be consensus that now's the time to be investing in this specific protocol.  Bluzelle sold 33 percent of its total pool of 500 million crypto tokens to 7,058 people and organizations.  Kenetic Capital, Kryptonite1 and 8 Decimal Capital participated in the ICO, which follows the $1.5 million in venture capital Bluzelle raised in August, in a round led by Global Brain, LUN Partners Capital and True Global Ventures.  While MySQL and several other open-source software projects are filling the database role on the internet, Pavel Bains, CEO and co-founder of Bluzelle, said he believes traditional tech companies will switch to decentralized database platforms as the technology matures.  One reason, he said, is that these platforms don't have the single point of failure that has plagued mainstream technology in recent years.  Bains told CoinDesk:  ""We see us as a complementary piece of the whole ecosystem. ... A natural complementary piece is going to be the database layer. What we've seen is, over the last year is nobody's really tackling this problem.""  Not one, but two tokens  Notably, Bluzelle didn't just create one token, it created two.  The first, BLZ, is the ethereum-based ERC-20 token that was sold during the ICO. BLZ will eventually be used to purchase the second, BTN, which was created only for use on the Bluzelle platform.  What Bluzelle found, as others, such as Kik and Mobius, have noticed, is that ethereum-based token transactions are just too slow and expensive for a service that, at scale, will need to constantly be running loads of micro-transactions.  ""If it's not fast, it's not going to be attractive,"" Bains said.  In this way, BTN will act as the speedy, cheap token for micropayments.  Plus, the company wants to be able to provide ""just-in-time pricing,"" meaning the price paid to specific nodes to host, share and write data, will change on the fly based on demand on the network.  Bains told CoinDesk:  ""If you did all those kinds of charges [with] a credit card or a traditional system, you'd eat a lot of merchants' fees.""  So why create the ERC-20 token in the first place?  Because crypto tokens that will be tradeable on the open market have been shown to entice a large community of people invested in the product's ongoing success. And as BLZ will be tradeable one-to-one with BTN, demand to access and use the platform should be accurately reflected in the price of the ERC-20 token, Bains said.  Cultivating the community  While Bluzelle has some competition in the space already from ethereum project Swarm, the latter's immutability might not be right for every user, as Keld van Schreven, cofounder of blockchain investment company Kryptonite1 and Bluzelle backer pointed out.  For instance, because the public data Bluzelle will host can be changed, it will benefit a number of applications, including those that must adhere to Europe's ""right to be forgotten"" laws.  Still, Bain said, Bluzelle is meant to be a ""complementary piece of the whole ecosystem.""  Currently, Bluzelle is focusing on the crypto space, citing prediction markets, currency exchange protocols and data streaming services as three potential early markets.  Each of these markets has actors that are reading as well as writing large volumes of data (sometimes both at once), which make for natural use cases for Bluzelle.  Now that the ICO is over, Bains said, the company has turned its focus to ""building out the open-source developer community,"" because developers are some of the earliest adopters of technology.  ""Our goal is to start with dapps,"" he said.  And with that, Bluzelle expects its first major release to happen in April, with a wider public release planned for July.  According to van Schreven:  ""Bluzelle has nailed an easy-to-use toolset and interface for developers building decentralized apps.""
