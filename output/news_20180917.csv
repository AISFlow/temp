42381240,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Nwj,1537219217,Ether Just Erased Half of Last Week's 35% Rally,"The price of ether (ETH), the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, sank nearly $30 today, effectively erasing half of the 35 percent rally recorded last week.  At press time, ETH is trading across exchanges at an average price of $196 - down $28 and 11 percent on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk's Ether Price Index (EPI).  The development came after what was a record-setting week for the cryptocurrency when it recorded its highest daily trading volume in over 12 months, most of which came from buyers. The surge in investor interest helped fuel a more than 35 percent rally in price from its weekly low of $167 set on September 12, to a high of $228 recorded just three days later.  The 12-month high in ETH trading volume proved to be a short-lived record, as it was surpassed by sellers today amid a broader market downturn.  At the time of writing, six of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are recording 24-hour losses above 6 percent, including the likes of bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), cardano (ADA) and monero (XMR). EOS is leading the pack, currently printing a daily loss of over 12 percent.  Bitcoin (BTC), the world's largest cryptocurrency, is faring better than most today, dropping only 4 percent on a 24-hour basis. That said, its current price of $6,223 is within arm's reach of an annual low near $5,800.  The risk-off sentiment currently plaguing the market will only get worse if bitcoin's annual low is surpassed, as it will reaffirm that the bears are getting stronger in an already overwhelmingly bearish market.

42381217,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94NgN,1537216257,Cryptojacking Scripts Found on Local Indian Government Sites,"Official government websites in India ran crypto mining scripts without their owners' knowledge, the Economic Times reported Monday.  Municipal government websites in the state of Andhra Pradesh, among others, were infected by cryptomining software such as Coinhive, security researchers found. Users visiting these websites would then inadvertently mine cryptocurrencies on behalf of the hackers who injected the scripts in the websites originally.  The process is called cryptojacking, as the malicious scripts essentially hijack a user's computer to mine cryptocurrencies.  Security researchers Shakil Ahmed, Anisha Sarma and Indrajeet Bhuyan discovered the vulnerabilities, finding that three of sites running cryptojacking malware belonged to the ap.gov.in subdomain, which sees 160,000 hits every month, according to the report.  Bhuyan told the Times that government websites are popular targets for malicious actors, saying:  ""Hackers target government websites for mining cryptocurrency because those websites get high traffic and mostly people trust them ... Earlier, we saw a lot of government websites getting defaced (hacked). Now, injecting cryptojackers is more fashionable as the hacker can make money.""  Andhra Pradesh's IT secretary did not respond to a request for comment from the Times, though the state's IT advisor to the chief minister, JA Chowdary, said ""thanks for notifying us about the AP website hacking,"" on September 10, according to the report.  Despite acknowledging the cryptojacking malware, the websites continued to run the scripts as of September 16, the Times noted.  It is unclear how long each website ran cryptojacking software, or how much cryptocurrency was mined for the attackers.

42381221,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Ndr,1537210835,Ukrainian Parliament Proposes Taxing Crypto-Related Profits,"The Ukrainian parliament wants to begin taxing residents' cryptocurrency-related profits.  Lawmakers proposed implementing a 5 percent tax on any cryptocurrency-related profits individuals and commercial entities see. These profits must be reported separately from other forms of income as well, according to the bill.  Further, commercial entities would see their taxation rate jump to 18 percent beginning on Jan. 1, 2024, should the bill pass.  The bill also suggests defining the concept of cryptocurrency within the country's Taxation Code as ""a virtual asset in a form of a token, which functions as a mean of exchange or a store of value,"" as well as defining virtual assets as a ""form of a digital record on the distributed ledger that can be used as a mean of exchange, unit of account or a mean of storing value.""  The bill also explains what crypto mining is.  The explanatory appendix for the bill notes that Ukraine hosted the early leaders of the mining industry and almost 30 percent of the global mining power, having been a home for the biggest bitcoin mining pool, GHash, at the time.  At one point in 2014, it controlled up to 55 percent of the total bitcoin protocol, raising questions if it could conduct a 51 percent attack, as CoinDesk reported at the time. But later, due to the regulation uncertainty in Ukraine, such companies left the country for friendlier jurisdictions like Canada, Georgia and Finland, the document states, leaving Ukrainians without a prominent money-making tool.  The document added:  ""Given the current state of affairs, Ukrainians are deprived of the opportunity to raise funds and resources to develop their ideas and technologies through traditional instruments. So, last year, Ukrainian companies did not get a single dollar through an IPO (primary public offering) mechanism. At the same time, according to the Ukrainian association UVCA and Deloitte in 2017, 19 Ukrainian start-ups attracted $ 160 million or more than UAH (Ukrainian hryvnia) 4.3 billion through the ICO (the primary token proposal).  As Ukrainian authorities estimated, the country's citizens own cryptocurrencies worth about 98.7 billion in the national currency, or about $3.5 billion, so legalization of the transactions with crypto assets will add at least $45 million in taxes annually in 2019-2024, the document says.

42381218,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Ncb,1537207208,"Ethereum Dapp Bancor Is Expanding to EOS for Fast, Free Transactions","Bancor, one of the most popular and valuable decentralized applications on ethereum, is expanding to the EOS blockchain.  According to a company announcement, the ""decentralized liquidity network,"" which allows users to trade a range of ethereum-based tokens without depositing funds in an exchange or matching trades in an order book, will bring that capability to EOS.  The new cross-chain product, called BancorX, will allow users to trade between select EOS-based tokens – which have yet to be specified – as well as between EOS- and ethereum-based tokens.  ""Bancor is now evolving into a cross-chain liquidity protocol,"" the company explained in the announcement, adding that it has published code for open-source smart contracts on EOS, allowing users to experiment with the protocol in a testing environment.  No timeline was set for BancorX's launch on EOS' live blockchain.  Explaining the decision to launch on EOS, Bancor's announcement cited the blockchain network's transaction speeds, which are faster than ethereum's, as well as its lack of fees – in contrast to the often-costly ""gas"" fees ethereum users must pay to call smart contracts.  As a corollary to the lack of fees, Bancor said that EOS eliminates ""front-running risk,"" since transactions aren't prioritized in exchange for paying higher fees.  It is worth noting, however, that while EOS transactions are fee-free for users, deploying dapps on the blockchain can be costly for developers, unless they choose to pass the costs on to users.  An emergency brake?  One feature of EOS that Bancor's announcement did not cite, but which may be relevant to Bancor's offering, is the ability for a supermajority of the network's block producers – who maintain the EOS blockchain in a way analogous to ethereum's miners – to effectively reverse transactions.  While block producers cannot erase completed transactions, they can forcibly transfer tokens from one address to another.  Nate Hindman, Bancor's communications director, denied that this feature of EOS influenced Bancor's decision to expand to that network, instead reiterating the benefits mentioned in the company's announcement: faster transactions, zero fees and resistance to front-running.  The freezing and reversal of EOS transactions has proved controversial, as many in the cryptocurrency community see the inability to do these things as a core appeal of blockchains. Indeed, many commentators reacted negatively to EOS block producers' decision to freeze transactions from a number of compromised accounts soon after the network's launch. Subsequently, the network's arbitration body ordered block producers to freeze yet more accounts.  Bancor, in a similar vein, is notable for its decision to write the ability to freeze and reverse certain transactions into its ethereum smart contract, as cryptocurrency developer Udi Wertheimer detailed in a blog post last year.  Eyal Hertzog, Bancor's co-founder and product architect, defended these design choices, citing the infamous DAO hack, which saw millions in funds siphoned away from smart contracts with no way to stop the theft. The incident eventually led the ethereum community to hard-fork the chain in order to reverse the damage.  Bancor made use of these capabilities following a security breach in July, when it blocked the transfer of 2.5 million BNT tokens, worth around $10 million at the time. The company was not able to prevent the theft of around $12.5 million worth of ether, however.  EOS, in contrast to ethereum, provides the ability to refer alleged thefts to arbitration and to have block producers reverse the damage through accepted – if controversial – methods.  Bancor's protocol is already being used on the EOS network to govern the market for RAM, a resource necessary for the creation of EOS accounts. Bancor also operates a block producer, LiquidEOS.

42381283,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Nk9,1537198234,Cloudflare Launches Decentralized Web Gateway at Its First 'Crypto Week',"Internet security provider Cloudflare is introducing a new product to help users more easily access the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), the decentralized storage protocol developed by Protocol Labs.  In a blog post Monday, Cloudflare announced it was launching a ""Crypto Week,"" where it will announce ""support for a new technology that uses cryptography to make the internet better"" every day. The first of these technologies is a portal to more easily access IPFS, as well as build websites on top of the technology.  In a second post, the company explains that the peer-to-peer nature of IPFS provides a number of redundancies for users trying to access a specific website or piece of data. The first is that content can be accessible even if a node goes down, whereas a single server failure might bring down a website on the existing internet.  The second feature revolves around the fact that users can request data using hash values, rather than IP addresses, which acts as a method of ensuring the data received is what was requested, according to the post.  To ensure users can access data stored through IPFS, Cloudflare is offering a gateway which delivers content using Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), the dominant protocol used to transfer data.  The post explained:  ""At the most basic level, you can access any of the billions of files stored on IPFS from your browser. But that's not the only cool thing you can do. Using Cloudflare's gateway, you can also build a website that's hosted entirely on IPFS, but still available to your users at a custom domain name. Plus, we'll issue any website connected to our gateway a free SSL certificate, ensuring that each website connected to Cloudflare's gateway is secure from snooping and manipulation.""  While Cloudflare's product is allowing access to a decentralized protocol, the company noted that users can still report abusive or harmful content, indicating that it may be able to revoke its portal to any websites providing such content.

42381200,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94LZX,1537192832,"Blockchain Can Help Solve Swathe of Environmental Issues, Says WEF Study","New research by the World Economic Forum (WEF) has identified over 65 ways blockchain tech can be used to address some of the most urgent environmental challenges facing the planet.  The insight study, conducted in partnership with auditing giant PwC and released at the Global Climate Action Summit last week, examines how new international platforms could ""incubate responsible blockchain ecosystems,"" according to a press release.  Such networks could range from decentralizing management of natural resources like energy and water, to creating supply chains that help promote greater sustainability. They could also provide new funding mechanisms for raising the vast sums of money expected to be required to deliver ""low-carbon and sustainable"" economic growth, the release adds.  As CoinDesk has reported, blockchain projects are already addressing issues such as the sustainability of tuna stocks by tracking fish from origin to the high-street store, or exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and boosting solar power projects via distributed trading.  ""Transparency is vital in influencing consumer decisions, updating supply chain practices and triggering new governance arrangements. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts could, for instance, be used to underpin innovative tenure arrangements that give specific resource rights to communities or fishers,"" the release states.  The research breaks down the areas that blockchain tech could positively impact into six sections: climate change, biodiversity and conservation, oceans, water security, clean air, weather and disaster resilience – each subdivided into more precise areas that could be targeted.  The report argues that such opportunities are being largely ignored by developers, investors and governments, yet they represent an opportunity to ""unlock and monetize value that is currently embedded in environmental systems.""  While blockchain use cases in disrupting finance have largely been the focus of enterprises and investors, Celine Herweijer, a partner at PwC UK, said:  ""There is an opportunity for fresh ideas to harness this nascent technology to help deliver big gains for our environment. From transparent and trusted clean and ethical supply chains, to incentivising sustainable consumption and production, or underpinning the much needed transition to low carbon decentralised energy, water and mobility systems.""

That's the driving idea behind a union between Kenetic, a crypto firm based in Hong Kong, and Tora, a trading systems firm that already supplies order execution, portfolio management, risk assessment and compliance services for well-established asset classes. Announced today, both companies are teaming up to create Caspian, a project that has raised $16 million in funding via a token presale.  Investors in the round include Kenetic, Galaxy Investment Partners, Octagon Strategy, Techemy Capital, Global Advisors and Bletchley Park, according to David Wills of Kenetic.  Wills called Caspian ""a frictionless on-ramp for crypto traders.""  Continuing, Wills said Caspian was built out of a need – one he saw firsthand when he transitioned from running a trading desk at the hedge fund Och-Ziff to Kenetic. Instead of having all the tools at their disposal, Kenetic was hacking together ways of making reports and visualizations to share data with the compliance and risk teams.  ""When I joined Kenetic, and it was sort of early days of running the business, it became very clear that different parts of our business needed a proper system to run all those businesses successfully,"" he told CoinDesk.  Ari Paul of BlockTower Capital, a partner on the project, agreed. ""Liquidity is fragmented across dozens of exchanges globally, each with their own quirky API connections. Professional trading software will facilitate greater liquidity in crypto assets,"" he told CoinDesk in an email.  Wills knew these products already existed in traditional finance but they just needed to be repurposed for crypto. And knowing the team at Tora from his prior career, he asked them for help.  ""We just sort of got the two management teams together and realized there was good culture fit,"" Wills said. ""They brought the trading system and we brought the connectivity to the crypto space.""  While the market for initial coin offerings (ICOs) has cooled somewhat, the companies are still pursuing a public sale in early October, looking to raise $1.5 million to $2 million from its relatively large community following.  ""To be honest it's more of a community building activity,"" Wills said.    Still, the team at Caspian has been encouraged by the size of the client pipeline they could have. The token will be used to buy access to Caspian; users that pay in the token will get a discount over those that don't.  There will be one billion caspian tokens, which were created with the ethereum token standard ERC-20. Of those, 40 percent are available for the token sale, with 32 percent available in the reserve for various future uses. The rest will be set aside for staff, advisors and the like.  According to Wills, some of the reserve could be sold later to fund building out a retail-friendly version of the service, or it could simply be put on the market to increase the supply available to existing users.  In a slide deck, the company contends it's already plugged in to 25 crypto exchanges, and offering a useable product to institutional clients.  Speaking to that, Wills concluded:  ""We're open for business.""  UPDATE (17 September 14:05 ​UTC​​): A previous version of this story incorrectly indicated BlockTower was an investor in Caspian's presale. Actually, it is a partner in the project. The article has also been corrected to indicate that Kenetic is based in Hong Kong, rather than Singapore.

42381207,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94LiL,1537185656,US Government Seizes Lambo and Crypto Millions from Dead Dark Web Kingpin,"On September 6, the Fresno Division of the Eastern District Court of California concluded a 14-month-long civil forfeiture case to seize assets and property belonging to Alexandre Cazes, the Canadian national who committed suicide by hanging in Thai prison last summer days after being arrested on suspicion of operating the darknet marketplace AlphaBay.  Cazes, whose death prevented him from standing trial, allegedly facilitated and profited from sales of illegal goods and services to United States and overseas customers on AlphaBay until law enforcement shut down the website in a dramatic confrontation outside of his primary residence, where he was led off in handcuffs on conspiracy charges related to identity theft, fraud, racketeering, trafficking and money laundering on July 7, 2017.  According to an arrest video investigating special agent Nicholas Phirippidis played at the International Conference on Cyber Security in January, officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration and Royal Thai Police crashed a squad car into the front gate of Cazes' Bangkok mansion to lure him into reach before he could encrypt or wipe digital evidence connected to the crimes.  That evidence – administrative accounts logged into AlphaBay forums and servers along with text files identifying password credentials for AlphaBay website and hosting services – was located on an open laptop police found in Cazes' bedroom while conducting a search and entry raid of his home.  A separate document breaking down Cazes' net worth, assessed at $23 million, recorded enormous sums of money, lavish real estate holdings and expensive cars that played up a life of luxury to match the black market fortune the 26-year-old is said to have amassed from commissions levied on AlphaBay transactions.  Because the website did not accept traditional payment methods, Cazes possessed more than $8.8 million in cryptocurrencies pooled across 1,605.05 bitcoins, 8,309.27 ether, 3,691.98 zcash and an unknown amount of monero, the financial statement indicated.  Customer funds were moved into multiple shell companies and cryptocurrency exchanges undetected this way. Federal complaints say Cazes used ""mixers"" and ""tumblers"" to programmatically split and combine the cryptocurrencies between several wallets, obscuring transaction histories.  The business fronts and the exchange wallets were linked to bank accounts Cazes and his wife Sunisa Thapsuwan, a native Thai citizen, registered in Thailand, Switzerland and the Caribbean to liquidate the funds into fiat money, including $770,000 in cash he saved on hand. The document marked the private keys and addresses for the wallets next to the cryptocurrency amounts.    Once the funds were converted, the couple splurged on four luxury vehicles – a $900,000 2013 Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 with a vanity license plate that read ""TOR"" (a reference to the privacy-enhancing Internet browser), an $81,000 Mini Cooper, a $21,000 BMW motorcycle and a $292,957 Porsche Panamera – and 6 beachfront vacation resorts overlooking the coasts of Thailand, Cyprus, St. Phillips South and Antigua and Barbuda.  The cars and the real estate properties, collectively valued at $12 million, were entered as claimants in the forfeiture motion, as were Cazes, Thapsuwan and his parents Martin Cazes and Danielle Heroux, who may have received money and gifts from their son that were purchased with proceeds collected from AlphaBay.  Silk Road parallels and differences  A notoriously lucrative enterprise from its inception in September 2014, AlphaBay was the busiest commercial venue on the dark web until Cazes' incarceration, peaking at over 400,000 lifetime users, 370,000 cumulative listings and $800,000 worth of daily transactions at the time of its collapse.  In 2015, AlphaBay made headlines when vendors sold user account data stolen from U.S. ridesharing app Uber and British telecommunications and broadcasting giant TalkTalk in company-wide data breaches. The following year, and the year after, AlphaBay's own website was compromised by hackers, who exposed upwards of 213,000 private user messages.  By then AlphaBay was 10 times the size of Silk Road, an earlier darknet marketplace that reigned as an one-stop shop for drugs, weapons, chemicals, malicious software and pirated and counterfeit information. Silk Road launched in February 2011 but closed in October 2013 when U.S. federal authorities apprehended Ross Ulbricht, its founder, in San Francisco.  Ulbricht, a 34-year-old Texan libertarian and University of Texas and Penn State graduate, has been serving a double-life sentence and 40 years in federal prison out of Colorado without the possibility of parole for similar charges the Southern District Court of New York pressed against him in February 2015.  However, Ulbricht's judgment factored in considerably more serious allegations of murder-for-hire. They were permanently dropped in July for lack of evidence, but his sentencing term remained unchanged with the decision.  The court's refusal to reconsider the conviction dealt another blow to defense efforts to reduce his sentence. Two appeals filed with the U.S. Supreme Court in December 2017 arguing Ulbricht's Fourth and Sixth Amendment rights had been violated were denied in the month prior to the dismissal of the pending murder-for-hire indictments.  Amicus curiae briefs drafted by an independent legal coalition in February defending the petition for a writ of certiorari suggested his Internet traffic data was seized without a warrant for probable cause and the judge presiding over his case failed to find the necessary facts to support the sentencing term.  A first appeal filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in January 2016 was previously rejected in May 2017. The appeal contested evidence of investigative malfeasance was illegally withheld during trial that, if aired, would have exposed inconsistencies in the prosecution's line of reasoning and a cover-up incriminating law enforcement in corruption scandals. Two D.E.A. agents were arrested for misusing and pocketing evidence during the course of the Silk Road investigation.    The appeals judge dissented and upheld the jury trial conviction. Ever since, Ulbricht's family and friends have been campaigning congressional leaders and political allies to commute his sentence under the Twitter handle ""@Free_Ross."" In July, the account tweeted a Change.org petition that has garnered over 80,000 signatures asking President Donald J. Trump to grant Ulbricht clemency. Supporters of the clemency claim the justice system mistreated Ulbricht.  Like the legal fallout, drama marred the pursuit to unmask his identity. While investigators also went undercover with AlphaBay purchases to dig up clues on Cazes, they implemented decidedly more aggressive means to monitor and bait Ulbricht from behind the screen. Trial testimony revealed intelligence authorities planted local and remote wiretaps on Ulbricht's computer devices and Internet service providers without court orders at the same time plainclothes police officers interacted with Ulbricht up close in his everyday life to befriend him and earn his trust.  As a result, Ulbricht's defense maintained their client was framed and, in agreement with U.S. Department of Homeland Security special agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan, accused Mark Karpeles, the CEO of the washed-up cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox, and Ashley Barr, Karpeles's colleague, of being the real ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" or the handler for the Silk Road administrator account whose ownership has come under dispute for these shared associations.  The D.P.R. pseudonym was handed down from user to user, and the National Security Agency possibly acted as an undisclosed force undermining the Silk Road investigation, Ulbricht's attorneys contended.  On the other hand, the government appears to have settled with following Cazes' paper trail from afar using groundwork investigative tactics, and Cazes' immediate circle and law enforcement officials have not challenged his leadership over AlphaBay or denounced the U.S. government for misconduct.  The federal government tracked Cazes down from his online aliases, as it initially did to Ulbricht before surveilling his Internet traffic with a pen/trap register. Welcome and password recovery emails listed the alleged AlphaBay mastermind's email address ""Pimp_Alex_91@hotmail.com"" as a contact source, analogous to the personal email addresses Ulbricht posted in forum boards that discussed Silk Road.  Case climate and contribution to crypto  Had he stayed alive, Cazes would have been extradited to the U.S. and faced an extensive conviction judgment as Ulbricht had, cyber-security experts and government watchdog groups have hypothesized. Both Silk Road and AlphaBay were situated on the dark web, an underground network of hidden Internet communities accessible only via encrypted software programs and anonymizing routing protocols like Tor and I2P.  By 2014, nearly half of the world populated the Internet, prompting government agencies to take notice of the dark web, where the full gamut of cyber-crimes ranging from gambling to child pornography flourished. The ease with which controlled substances could be bought and sold on there quickly evolved into an investigative nexus for the U.S. Department of Justice, which did not respond to requests for comments, to prosecute the war on drugs.  Today, the government's search for accomplices in both the Silk Road and AlphaBay cases has been actively ongoing, supported by a federal cyber-crime division that coordinates with the Internet Crime Complaint Center to tackle computer crimes. In March, the Northern District Court of Georgia arrested Illinois resident Ronald L. Wheeler, also known as ""Trappy,"" for marketing and promoting AlphaBay.  Gray and black market narratives have also persisted. Among notable figures who have double downed on old criticisms of cryptocurrencies, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and financial economist Paul Krugman once again recently minimized the technology's pervasive money laundering and tax evasion use cases. Critics, who responded saying the industry titans had rehashed tired points, waged on the contrary that cash and other variations of physical money have been used for these express purposes for centuries, often with greater degrees of secrecy.  Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was stigmatized early on as the preferred financial reserve for delinquent lawbreakers. The once-leading darknet websites mandated that users pay strictly in cryptocurrencies, which sometimes accounted for the bulk of trading volumes on most major exchanges when Silk Road and AlphaBay were online.  For the time being, AlphaBay and Silk Road clones have sprung up in the background and moved immense hauls of illicit goods and services in cryptocurrencies, although none have quite lived up to their predecessors' legacies. In 2014, the F.B.I. and Interpol took down Diabolus Market, a Silk Road 2.0 former administrators ran upon the downfall of the original Silk Road. Silk Road 3.0, or Silk Road 3 Reloaded, went financially under of its own accord in 2017 after having gone live in 2016.  AlphaBay's successor, Empire Market, surfaced in March and is still very much up and running, according to the website's search engine indexed results.

42381214,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Lkr,1537182018,"$6,550: Bitcoin Charts Suggest New Target for Price Rally","The corrective rally in bitcoin (BTC) could gather momentum if key resistance above $6,500 is crossed on the back of high volumes, according to technical charts.  The leading cryptocurrency witnessed a symmetrical triangle breakout last week, opening doors for a stronger corrective rally towards $6,800–$7,000.  However, despite the bullish setup, BTC was rejected near $6,600 on Friday and spent the weekend trading in a sideways manner in the range of $6,350–$6,550. As a result, the immediate bullish outlook has been neutralized.  Further, trading volumes fell to a two-month low of $3.22 billion on Saturday, putting a question mark on the sustainability of the recovery from the recent lows near $6,100.  That said, the corrective move could resume if the cryptocurrency sees a high volume bullish break from the three-day long narrowing price range.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,490 on Bitfinex – down 0.10 percent on a 24-hour basis.  4-hour chart        As can be seen, BTC has charted a narrowing price range over the weekend. A break above $6,540 (triangle resistance) would signal a continuation of the rally from the Sept. 8 low of $6,119.  More importantly, it would strengthen the bullish case put forward by last week's bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence and symmetrical triangle breakout.  On the other hand, a break below $6,380 (lower end of the narrowing price range) would signal an end of the corrective rally.  Daily chart  Over on the daily chart, the bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MA) indicates the path of least resistance in on the higher side. So, the cryptocurrency is more likely to extend the corrective rally in the short-run.  View  A high volume move above $6,540 (upper end of the range) could yield a sustained rally toward $7,000 (psychological hurdle). On the way higher, BTC may encounter resistance at $6,710 (50-day MA) and $6,750 (100-day MA).  A downside break of the narrowing price range would mean the corrective rally from the low of $6,119 has ended and that level could be put to test again.

At press time, XTZ is trading at $1.55, having clocked a 5.5-week high of $1.75 at 13:10 UTC on Saturday. At that point, XTZ was up 35 percent from Friday's low of $1.29, according to CoinMarketCap data.  The cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid on Friday after the developers tweeted that Tezos' mainnet arrives on Sept. 17. In fact, the mainnet has been live in beta since late June with tokens tradeable on some exchanges.  Notably, trading volumes also jumped 169 percent on Friday to a nine-week high of $5.13 million, marking a surge in investor interest in the cryptocurrency.  It's been a long wait for investors in the project. Having raised $232 million via an ICO in July 2017 – one of the largest token sales ever – things were looking bright for Tezos. However, the development of the blockchain network was thrown into disarray due to a bitter legal tussle for control between the founders and co-founding members of the project – problems that now seem largely resolved by a shift in governance.  Looking forward, if the launch goes well and the trading volumes remain healthy, then XTZ could soon revisit Friday's high of $1.75.

Announced Sunday, the trial effort will see the company working with partners in Japan, Taiwan and the U.S. to offer users of three mobile carriers cheaper and faster payments when travelling internationally.  Expected to launch early in 2019, the system is based on a blockchain cross-carrier payment platform provided by project partner, U.S.-based TBCASoft, according to The Korea Times.  LG Uplus has also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) Thursday with two other carriers – Taiwan-based Far EasTone Telecommunications and Japan-based SoftBank – to work together on the trial.  The service will enable LG Uplus subscribers to make purchases at select retailers using their cellphones when they travel to Taiwan and Japan. Similarly, users of Far EasTone and SoftBank will be able to shop via phone-based payments when travelling in Korea and Japan.  ""Customers will have the benefit of an overseas payment system based on convenient, economical and secure blockchain technology,"" Joo Young-joon, director of the mobile services at LG Uplus was quoted as saying.  Aimed to help users avoid costly international card transactions and speed up the payments process, the service bills for transactions through the carriers to be paid in users' home countries and in their national fiat currency via their mobile bills.  TBCASoft said it also reduces the risk associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, according to The Times.  Interestingly, the news comes less than a week after Softbank announced that it had completed a blockchain proof-of-concept for peer-to-peer mobile payments across different carriers, as reported by CoinDesk.  Softbank said at the time that the technology was also developed in partnership with TBCASoft, as well as Synchronoss, a Nasdaq-listed firm that delivered a SMS-replacement communications protocol called Rich Communication Service (RCS) in Japan.

In a series of largely similar patent applications published last week by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Mastercard outlines how a distributed ledger can be used to record ""point-to-point transactions"" as they are processed. This information can then be used by organizations or members of those organizations to create a log of items procured during the course of business.  A blockchain ledger can, in particular, be used to streamline account management, one of the applications explains, by simplifying the process in which purchase orders are registered orders and monitored.  Monitoring purchases on multi-service platforms can likewise be simplified using a blockchain, Mastercard contends in the documents.  The firm goes on to explain:  ""The use of digital ledgers, such as blockchains, may further facilitate the services provided by such a platform, by enabling data to be stored clearly and in a format that is easily auditable by participating entities. In cases where ledgers like blockchains are used, the ledgers may be provided even more benefits as they may be immutable and resistant to tampering, which may further increase the reliability of such data.""  ""As a result, such a platform may provide a great number of services to entities while doing so in a manner that is more secure and transparent than any number of systems dedicated to even a single one of the multiple services,"" the patent application states.  As previously reported, Mastercard has secured several patents related to blockchain, including one that details a method for speeding up cryptocurrency payments. The payments giant has also indicated its interest in hiring blockchain specialists in the past, marking another sign that Mastercard is actively pursuing applications of the technology.

42381197,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94LTF,1537156255,Gas Ain't Gold: Why Ether's Price Could Tank Even If Ethereum Succeeds,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      The virtuous circle that saw buyers of ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens drive ether's price above $1,400 mid-January has morphed into its diametric opposite.  The initial coin offering boom has fizzled and the price has sunk to just above $200.  This new phase, a vicious cycle downturn that has exposed the ether market's intrinsic connection to the ICO boom and bust, is of course painful for anyone who bought ether in the last 12 months.  But in the spirit of encouraging the crypto community to embrace failure as a real-world source of learning and growth, the experience is also incredibly informative for understanding how value is formed and lost in crypto assets attached to blockchain platforms.  This dynamic is still being figured out. However, a strong hypothesis is emerging that the correlation between the price of a token such as ether and its actual or expected network utility —that's is, its value as the ""fuel"" in a blockchain ecosystem — might not be very strong.  This is challenging for anyone who, like me, was initially enthusiastic about the ""fat protocol thesis."" As a recap, that idea, convincingly made by Union Square Ventures partner Albert Wenger, held that the prospect of rising prices for utility tokens allows developers of open-access software platforms to extract value for their work even when the underlying protocol is open and free.  It argued that crypto assets and blockchains would overhaul the prevailing Internet paradigm in which value could only be extracted by application developers who could charge users for their services whereas the developers of open-access protocols such as SMTP an HTTP were condemned by the requirement that they be free of charge.  But now we're left wondering whether tokens, these units of value/mediums of exchange – call them what you will – might have their upside fiat-currency monetization power capped because price could be antithetical to utility (which we might define as ""transactability."")  In Money, Bad Trumps Good  In essence, the problem has to do with Gresham's Law that ""bad money drives out good"" – the idea being that if you want a currency, or any token used for economic exchange, to function as a fluid enabler of transactions within your community, you don't want it to be overly attractive as an investment or store of value.  If a currency has that ""good"" quality – i.e. is durable, fungible, scarce, and can't be debased by some centralized issuer – it will appeal more as something to hold rather than use.  This has fueled the idea among mainstream economists that there's a sweet spot in which the interests of a community – but not necessarily those of the individual – are best served by their money being just a bit ""bad."" There needs to be some modest expectation of depreciation or inflation if a currency is to be trading. Communities need people to be willing to offload their currency rather than hoard it.  Milton Friedman, the father of monetarist economics, said as much, arguing that a very modest amount of expected, inflationary monetary expansion is desirable. It's by no means an argument for currency debasement and rampant abuse of fiat power. It's about optimizing exchangeability versus investment prospects.  I've argued elsewhere that this might be a problem for bitcoin, not for HODLing investors per se but in whether it can ever challenge the dominant fiat currencies as a medium of exchange. Bitcoin is a very ""good"" currency in terms of its scarcity and incorruptibility, which means its store of value qualities trump its transactional utility.  Many bitcoin enthusiasts dispute this view, arguing that after establishing itself as a solid store of value, a currency can then become useful as a transactional unit. Time will tell whether they are right, but for now I think the store of value treatment of bitcoin is winning out.  Notwithstanding its massive price drop since December, anyone who bought into bitcoin in the eight years before its runup last fall will quite satisfied with the returns they've had by just holding it. By contrast, real-world, non-capital transactions are few and far between. Layer Two solutions such as Lightning will make transactions easier, but I'm not convinced that this scarce ""good"" currency will become widely transacted.  Can Ether Have Reservation Demand?  What does all this have to with ether?  Well, as Vijay Boyapati laid out in a provocative tweetstorm, ethereum's smart contract functionality depends on people using and transacting in ether. That's what ether's metaphorical identity as the ""gas"" of ethereum is all about. But Boyapati said that's antithetical to the concept of ""reservation demand,"" a measure of how long people hold a currency and the core driver of the price of a monetary unit.  For the brief period of ICO mania last year, Boyaparti argued, ether suddenly attracted reservation demand because investors needed to acquire and hold a store of ether to participate in the ongoing flow of ERC-20 token offerings.  But now that flow has stopped. The issuers of those tokens who really just wanted dollars to fund their operations — not a store of ether with which to conduct smart contracts — are now faced with an existential threat if they don't dump the rapidly falling ethereum tokens they hold. Hence the conversion of a virtuous circle into a vicious circle.  Jeremy Rubin, a Stellar developer and former MIT colleague of mine, argued in a TechCrunch piece that these and other aspects of the ethereum ecosystem could drive the price of ether to zero.  A key point of Rubin's was that issuers of tokens that trade on top of ethereum can and will be incentivized to build models in which their smart contract network is managed not by transactions in the underlying ""gas"" of ether but by the incentives baked into trading in their own token.  The piece stirred up a lot of emotion, including a rebuttal of this ""economic abstraction"" argument from ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin.  Where Does Value Meet Price?  I'm not convinced of Rubin's argument that the price is destined for zero even if, as he assumes, ethereum ends up succeeding as a ubiquitous smart contracts platform that enables world-changing dapps.  In essence, I think there is some natural base level of reservation demand that will always be there for a unit of exchange that makes a powerful blockchain tick. And it's hard not to imagine that this level of demand increases if and when ethereum moves to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. At some point, utility value does correlate with price, just not with nearly the same direct relationship that people have assumed.  This debate is very important. If a disconnect is established between utility value and price, it will greatly affect how participants in token markets generally treat the assets they are trading. Note, however, that might actually encourage the development of dapps that are all about functionality and not just fronts for quick money-grabbing efforts by crypto startup founders.  The jury is also still out on the whether etheruem, or any blockchain platform, is even successful at all. But I look at the incredibly inventive community of ethereum developers toying around with wonderful new ideas for a better world and find it very difficult not to conclude that, in some as yet undefined way, they are creating a great deal of value.  It's just that, sadly for those who thought otherwise, that concept of value might be inherently at odds with the concept of price — at least as it is defined in fiat currencies. And that's a topic for another day…  Ether and gold image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Michael J.
