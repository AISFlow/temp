42400602,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK84K,1509663607,Smarter Bug Bounties? Hydra Codes Creative Solution for Ethereum Theft,"Can the right alignment of incentives encourage better blockchain bug reporting?  That's the goal of Hydra, a new effort funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and designed by a team of researchers including Lorenz Breidenbach, Phil Daian and Ari Juels from Cornell, and Florian Tramer from Stanford.  Announced today at ethereum's annual developer conference, Devcon3, the Hydra project is novel in that its contracts aim to automatically and programmatically offer those who report a bug higher rewards than they'd get if they exploited one. In this way, if a user's smart contract hack would result in a reward of 100 tokens, Hydra would pay out 1,000 tokens if he or she reported it instead.  As such, the project offers a potential solution to an incentive problem common in smart contract development. A popular tool for open-source projects, many times payouts simply make the bad behavior more lucrative.  Hydra tweaks the incentives, however, testing how the nascent concept of crypto-economics – simply, the study of cryptocurrency economies – might encourage people to report bugs they identify.  But rather than condemning the actions of bad actors, Daian sees Hydra as a solution that blends pragmatism and smart programming.  Daian said:  ""Let's see this as a game. What would a rational attacker do with these systems? Say an attacker finds a bug: would they attack or would they claim the bounty?""  But while many will be excited to start playing around with the system, released in alpha today, Daian stressed that it's still nascent technology that might not be safe for storing funds.  He said, ""The code is here for you to play with. But trusting funds with this baby Hydra we've spun up – not good idea.

In an interview with CoinDesk, swarm lead developer Viktor Tron said the proof-of-concept will be launching after ethereum's flagship developer conference Devcon3, going on now.  Tron emphasized how this work fits into the wider vision for ethereum, since the proof-of-concept will be fully compatible with the Geth client and the Whisper messaging protocol, bringing ethereum one step closer to its ""holy trinity"" vision, where three systems provide a complete alternative to the World Wide Web.  This third proof-of-concept gets swarm closer to the ethereum mainnet, which is expected for the spring or summer of 2018 with the launch of a fourth proof-of-concept.  Currently, the swarm team is completely rewriting the network layer, synchronization and retrievability, and connectivity layer and chunk synchronization, according to Tron.  Swarm should function much like Dropbox – providing the ability for platform users to store content and create and share folders – within this proof-of-concept, although the platform will be resistant to censorship.  He told CoinDesk:  ""If you operate it on Swarm, there's no way for a jurisdiction to take that down because it's this obfuscation method. Nodes can plausibly deny that they have the content. This is a very important feature because it's censorship-resistant basically.""  According to Tron, Swarm could pave the way for many ""beautiful things,"" such as distributed public archives that cannot be shut down or censored.  The proof-of-concept will also be stress tested through a network simulation framework that can mimic emergent behavior, Tron said.

Amazon has always been zealous with regards to defensive domain name registrations, many of which are performed remotely by brand protection agencies, as opposed to the business behemoth itself.This certainly seems like a viable explanation, especially considering Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin’s recent comment on the company’s block chain readiness compared to other tech giants: “Amazon, we’ve not seen that much, so we’ll see.”The true meaning behind the move remains to be seen, but one thing is for certain: with or without Amazon on the bandwagon, cryptocurrencies are most certainly on the rise.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/amazon-registers-cryptocurrency-domain-names,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/15990331.jpeg

At a press conference today, the New York Times reports, the bank chief called bitcoin's anonymity a ""challenge,"" before going on to say:  ""From what we can identify, the only reason today to buy or sell bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble.""  Criminal use of bitcoin is also a factor that goes against the cryptocurrency, he went on, arguing that banks ""have little or no appetite to get involved in a currency which has such anti-money laundering challenges.""  Thiam joins a growing list of financial industry names who have come out against the digital currency. Last week, billionaire investor Warren Buffett was the most recent to say bitcoin was in a bubble. He echoed Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, who expressed the same sentiment to CNBC in September.  At the time, Dalio noted that the speculation and volatility around bitcoin prevented it, in his eyes, from being an effective store of wealth.  While all over the news currently with its meteoric price gains, Thiam added that he expects interest in bitcoin to subside.

While tokens classed as securities or primarily created for fundraising will not be considered, those with utility will, providing there is a ""clear and compelling reason"" for the token to exist.  According to the document, the exchange will also assess each asset's levels of security and liquidity, the token scheme's structure and the transparency of the project.

42400618,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK8L3,1509631263,Short-Term Top? Bitcoin Price Seeks Direction on Choppy Charts,"Back to square one?  As per CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data, bitcoin smashed previous price records to hit $7,355.35 at 11:17 UTC today, only to crash back below $7,000 soon after. At press time, bitcoin is trading at $7,011.  As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has gained 7.19 percent in the last 24 hours. With the continued record-breaking run fueling accusations that bitcoin is in a bubble, the cryptocurrency has rallied more than 120 percent from the September lows below $3,000.  But are there fundamentals behind the gains?  It certainly looks possible as bitcoin's trading community continues to cheer a potential listing on the CME, which is seen as opening doors for profit-hungry institutional investors.  Elsewhere, bullish sentiment is proving strong enough potential headwinds with the upcoming SegWit2x hard fork, effectively a bout of uncertainty in its technical roadmap, have been pushed to the sidelines. The proposal, which would increase the block size from 1MB to 2MB, is scheduled to happen in about 2 weeks from now.  While the hard fork is intended to be a simple software upgrade that would become the dominant bitcoin code, there's also the risk of a split into two rival assets: bitcoin and a ""Segwit2x coin."" Should that happen, holders of bitcoin would effectively receive free cryptocurrency, and it appears the investor community may be snapping up bitcoins on that hope.  Though some investors might be wary of the coming hard fork, the sharp retreat from the record highs seen today is likely to be chart driven.  Still, the price action analysis warns of a potential bearish reversal pattern.  Daily chart  The above chart shows:  A sharp retreat from session highs. The daily candle carries a long upper shadow, which indicates bullish exhaustion.  A bearish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence (higher highs on price, lower highs on the RSI) would be confirmed if today's candle turns red (i.e. prices end the day below $6,759).  View  A confirmation of bearish price-RSI divergence would signal short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change. In such a case, bitcoin could revisit $6,000-$5,700 levels. The move would qualify as a healthy correction, given the cryptocurrency is up more than 500 percent this year.  A short-term consolidation in the range of $6,500-$7,400 looks more likely.

42400615,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK8H7,1509620419,Nasdaq Exec: Blockchain Progress Slow Amid Real-World Roadblocks,"Blockchain may be ready for primetime use on some of the world's largest stock exchanges, but that doesn't mean integrating the technology in financial systems will be an easy ride.  At the London Blockchain Summit on Oct. 31, Nasdaq Clearing's recently promoted head of product development, Gustaf von Boisman, addressed this gap, highlighting how the technology's current capabilities aren't necessarily leading to drastic restructuring. As such, the talk served to illustrate how major overhauls to the traditional financial system aren't what's being focused on, but instead very specific use cases.  For instance, in a notable example, von Boisman said that, while blockchains are capable of reducing settlement times down to real-time speeds, activating such a system within the framework of the financial industry could prove more complicated.  Von Boiseman pointed to several exchanges – including the Saudi Arabia Stock Exchange and the Moscow Stock Exchange – as companies that reached the coveted T+0 (same-day) settlement times with technology, only to return to slower settlements because of other drivers, for example demands for international harmonization and other market structure issues.  He told the audience:  ""We're confident that the technology can do the job, and that comes back to how settlement can happen. It's more of a choice of market than a technological choice.""  Nasdaq's current interest in blockchain includes work with advertising platform NYIAX, Swiss stock exchange SIX and – announced recently – Swedish bank SEB. To avoid market issues, though, von Boisman advocated that enterprises should look to break down the blockchain use cases that can modernize financial systems into smaller step goals.  ""That's sort of the way we're looking at this, finding opportunities where we can look at the settlement of a particular use case and find what is the best for this particular implementation,"" Von Boisman concluded.  Correction: An earlier version of this story misinterpreted a Nasdaq executive’s remarks about the progress and potential of blockchain technology. It also misparaphrased the reasons he gave why some stock exchanges have moved away from T+0 settlement times.

42400605,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK87H,1509616819,Free Market Forks? Bitcoin Startups Love the Idea But Brace for Reality,"You've probably heard the phrase ""let the free market decide.""  It's the concept that consumers and businesses determine the prices of services and products and whether they gain traction; an expression of the idea that the economic system should be one wherein supply and demand are unhindered from any government, authority or monopoly intervention.  More than an ideal, it's also the very real lens by which bitcoin's startups are looking at Segwit2x, a proposed change to the bitcoin software that's just weeks away from being introduced to the network.  Some users, namely many Bitcoin Core developers (and the miners and businesses that ideologically support their work) don't plan to go along with the changes, and so it seems more and more likely that the mid-November fork will lead to the creation of a new bitcoin cryptocurrency (yes, another one).  That said, the Segwit2x group has managed to secure two important blocks of supporters: miners and bitcoin businesses, and they continue to claim that these entities are broadly representative of users.  Those claiming to go along with the upgrades include mining pools (representing around 80 percent of bitcoin's computing power, though the figure is a bit misleading) and many bitcoin companies, including two of the most popular consumer wallet providers – Blockchain and Coinbase.  Segwit2x opponents have tended to demonize the companies involved in Segwit2x, arguing they're trying to ""corporatize"" or ""take over"" bitcoin in that the proposal tries to push through a bitcoin rule change that not all users agree with. But, as to be expected, many startups don't see it that way.  Firstly, startups feel they're merely advocating for a change that at least a subset of their users are behind. And secondly, startups don't see themselves as all that powerful.  ""The truth is this is a material event which may demonstrate where the 'consensus' center of gravity lies between miners and the development community; not all actors in the ecosystem are as influential as those two groups,"" said Hugh Madden, CTO of bitcoin exchange ANX.  He added:  ""Most users and businesses can't do much beyond stating a view, stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle.""  Planning for a split  This view is also reflected in the policy updates bitcoin startups have released ahead of Segwit2x.  Again, although the goal of Segwit2x is to upgrade bitcoin, not split it – it's a contentious proposal, and it's looking quite possible that not all users will move over to the new blockchain.  With that in mind, bitcoin companies that support Segwit2x are gearing up for this possibility.  ""There is a significant possibility that the planned hard fork will result in two bitcoin blockchains,"" a post from bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain reads, outlining further how it will deal with user funds in the event of a split.  In the post, the startup explains it will follow the chain with the most accumulated difficulty (a metric meant to denote the number of computers securing the blockchain) and refer to that as ""bitcoin."" If the cryptocurrency on the so-called ""minority chain"" has significant value, it will be made available for customers to hold or trade.  The post goes on to make clear that outgoing bitcoin transactions could be temporarily suspended for a period of time during any network instability that results from the hard fork.  Updates from other bitcoin companies outline similar steps to be taken in the event of a split.  Over email, Ripio founder and CEO Sebastian Serrano indicated much the same – that its wallet will follow the chain with ""the most accumulated difficulty.""  And BitPay, the network's largest transaction processor for payments, followed suit, announcing on Wednesday that it would ""suspend payment acceptance, payment disbursement and debit card reloads approximately 24 hours prior to activation of Segwit2x.""  Opportunity knocks  While startups seem on the same page about how to deal with a split, they have mixed views about whether a split will actually occur.  Yours co-founder Ryan X. Charles, an ardent support of Segwit2x believes Segwit2x will win out due to the commitment from miners and businesses.  But, other startups (and even some miners) don't share the same outlook.  ""As of now, it seems relatively unlikely that Segwit2x will emerge as the major token,"" said Crypto Facilities co-founder and CEO Timo Schlaefer, citing prediction markets and node counts as the reason.  But that's not a problem for all startups. Some see a Segwit2x-induced split as a way to grow their business amidst what could be a volatile time for the network. GoCoin founder Steve Beauregard, for instance, said the payment processor will ""likely"" accept tokens from both chains ""provided the liquidity is satisfactory"" for each.  Still other firms, even original signees of the Segwit2x agreement, plan to take a wait-and-see approach.  ANX's Madden told CoinDesk:  ""It is a mess. We will schedule a significant outage and monitor the situation carefully, before deciding which, if not both, chains will be supported.""  Free market devotees  But apart from pragmatism, ideology is also at play.  For the companies that signed the Segwit2x agreement, bitcoin should be considered a payment mechanism, one that would flourish with a larger block size capacity that would allow more transactions per block and lower fees for users.  ""I am convinced that we need greater capacity to reach the next 100 million bitcoin users, and by the time the New York Agreement took place, most of us we were sure that Segwit2x was the best way to break the lock on the bitcoin project development,"" Ripio's Serrano said.  In this way, Shapeshift CEO Erik Voorhees, too, believes the agreement has already helped move the network forward, evoking the original intent to pass SegWit and increase the block size.  ""We remain committed to our agreement to upgrade the bitcoin protocol to both SegWit and a 2 MB base block size. It is our opinion that SegWit activated because of this very agreement (after failing to achieve even 40 percent of mining support on its own), and we will honor our part to carry it to completion,"" he said.  But, Voorhees is also attempting to be diplomatic to potential customers, suggesting – similarly to Beauregard – that businesses are keen to ensure that their decisions now don't harm their future growth.  ""We understand some people disagree with this approach, but this is an open, decentralized protocol, and we will work to help it move in the direction we believe to be in the best interest of bitcoin's long-term development and growth,"" he continued.  Still, in the end, many of the industry's startups remain devout to the idea the market should decide.  Voorhees continued:  ""If the market prefers the status quo, we will accept that, and we'll happily continue building along with consensus. If the market prefers the Segwit2x upgrade, our preferred outcome, again we'll happily continue building along with consensus.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organize the Segwit2x proposal, and has an ownership stake in Blockchain, Coinbase, Crypto Facilities and Shapeshift.

Marco Abele worked for the banking institution from 2006 until this August, serving most recently as head of digital, according to LinkedIn. Prior to that, Abele worked at Deutsche Bank in its corporate and investment banking division.  Now, he's spearheading a startup called Tend, an ethereum-powered marketplace for sharing ownership of luxury assets, such as cars and jewelry.  As Abele explained in a statement:  ""Many people today are finding that there is more value in experience than ownership, and that it is about access to fine things, not just possession of them. At the same time, conventional investments have become uninteresting for the modern generation. That makes meaningful, special assets increasingly desirable and hence valuable.""  In essence, the platform offers users a kind of time share for high-value goods. The token offering will be structured like a bond under Swiss securities law, which Tend claims will be a first.  Without going into detail, the website promises that Tend will take ""care of the associated obligations of the object owners, including insurance and logistics.""  The firm further indicated that it has been running an alpha test with 20 users and plans to conduct the token sale in the coming months, though no specific timeline was provided for the event.

Trevon Gross was charged in March 2016, with federal prosecutors alleging that the pastor took bribes from those behind Coin.mx. In exchange, prosecutors said, Gross helped the firm use the Hope Federal Credit Union (which was later closed down by regulators) to facilitate international payments.  Gross, whose trial began in February, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan on Monday.  As previously reported, Coin.mx was a Florida-based exchange that was shuttered in mid-2015 after its two operators, Anthony Murgio and Yuri Lebedev, were arrested and charged with running an unlawful money services business. Coin.mx was accused of obscuring the nature of its business by operating as a so-called ""Collectible's Club.""  The U.S. government later tied the exchange to a broader crime ring that targeted firms like J.P. Morgan with cyberattacks.  Gross was ultimately convicted in March along with Lebedev, who himself was sentenced to 16 months in prison last week. Murgio was sentenced to five-and-a-half years in June.  According to Reuters, Gross was also handed a $12,000 fine.

42400601,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK83L,1509588013,'A Modest Proposal': Vitalik Unveils Multi-Year Vision for Ethereum,"What do you do after you've created a multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency?  A skinny, 23-year-old hacker in a green ""Doge"" t-shirt gave us an answer today. At ethereum's flagship conference, Devcon, project creator Vitalik Buterin revealed he has been quietly working on a new long-term plan for the future of the blockchain network. What he called a ""modest proposal,"" is perhaps better described as a three-to-four-year roadmap for ethereum's technical development.  Notably at the heart of the vision is a long-in-the-making technical change to ethereum called ""sharding,"" and while always expected to be included in the protocol's plans, today Buterin proposed what might be his most solidified strategy for the technique to date.  As such, the roadmap hints at problems yet to be solved on the platform, and puts the emphasis on scalability for project developers. As ethereum nodes need to store everything that ever happened on the network, Buterin stressed that there's a need for solutions that mitigate expensive storage costs that could escalate exponentially as the system expands.  It's a topic that's long been top-of-mind for the developer, as Buterin recently released new research into alleviating this problem.  Still, the talk was evidence of his emphasis on finding solutions, and of his efforts to galvanize ethereum developers more broadly to be thinking about the effort.  ""The amount of activity on the blockchain is orders of magnitude larger than it was just a couple of years ago,"" he said, pointing to daily transaction rates and the more than 20,000 nodes now part of the network.  With this, he suggested ethereum is running up against its limits.  Buterin told the crowd:  ""Scalability is probably problem number one [...] There’s a graveyard of systems that claim to solve the scalability problem but don't. It's a very significant and hard challenge. These are just known facts.""  High-level details  And Buterin believes sharding is the ""likely"" solution to this problem.  A way of partitioning data into subsets that takes its inspiration from traditional databases, the idea is that each node will only have to store a small chunk of the total network. Yet, the vision is that the underlying math would hold the system accountable, and if they need it, nodes could rely on other nodes for data.  How to execute on this in practice, and securely – without nodes sending other nodes false information – is another question that researchers have been looking into.  But Buterin is proposing a new type of sharding infrastructure that would solve both scalability and governance – ensuring the eventual system is well maintained and that it stays in check.  The proposal revealed today is for ethereum to be split into different types of shards. There will be the main shard, which would comprise today's ethereum network; then there would be other shards, which Buterin calls other ""universes.""  Crucially, though, Buterin believes the partitioning would allow for more aggressive changes on the smaller shards, and more cautious changes on the main blockchain. That way, ethereum still has platform stability, while developers still have room to test new changes and to experiment and move fast on the other shards.  Or as Buterin put it:  ""Other universes where all this stuff we’ve been working on these last few years can be rolled out much much faster.""  Looking forward  Buterin's roadmap includes other changes too, though they were less prominent in his talk.  These included planned upgrades to the ethereum virtual machine (EVM), the technology that today compiles smart contract code and communicates it to the network. He also addressed another long-in-the-making tech project, eWASM, for running ethereum in a web browser, one that hints at the necessity of ensuring this system given that the EVM has been implemented in other blockchain projects as well.  Another idea proposed was for so-called ""stateless clients,"" a proposal for how clients could sync with the network more quickly.  ""You'll be hearing about this idea more and more,"" he said. He invited developers to contribute to the effort, much of the research of which is housed on GitHub.  But, all in all, sharding looks to be the biggest change over the next three to four years, and Buterin ended by adding there's already developer work going on in these exploratory areas.  Notably, he hinted work might be further along than widely thought.  Buterin concluded:  ""Basically we’re just inches away from a proof of concept in python.""

42400606,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK88G,1509580818,Cornell Professor Claims Blockchain Advances with Thunder Token Debut,"A Cornell computer science professor known for her work on the fundamentals of distributed systems is soon to launch a new blockchain project.  Announced today at ethereum's annual developer conference, Devcon3, Elaine Shi explained that the upcoming work will be based on the thunderella protocol – a paper she co-authored alongside Cornell associate professor Rafael Pass earlier this year. Called thunder token, the effort aims to address a problem common to blockchains, their inability to accommodate significant numbers of users.  In the talk today, Shi proclaimed that thunder token may be able to achieve speeds 1,000x greater than available technologies today. Further, much like some other projects that have been popping up recently, it doesn't rely on a blockchain – at least, not entirely.  While in more traditional blockchain systems, blocks need to be validated for transactions to occur, it's a process that takes time, around 10 minutes per block in bitcoin, for example.  In this way, Shi sought to portray thunder token as a fast and scalable protocol – the ""dream of large-scale consensus"" – one she thinks could prove viable for banks and corporations.  Shi explained:  ""With cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum we now have empirical evidence that distributed consensus is now possible on a really large scale on the internet. We want to replicate that success.""  Currently, Shi said that blockchain consortiums such as R3 and Hyperledger are racing to create systems tailored for these large-scale formats, but that there's not enough focus on reworking or improving on the limitations of the underlying protocols in use.  In thunder token, the protocol proposes a split set-up so that transactions are confirmed very quickly, with the blockchain only being used in the case of emergencies. The rest of the time, thunder token will use something a little less familiar – a system of agents that follows the direction of a ""leader"" to vote on which transactions are made according to the rules.  Shi contends this design is ""as simple and robust as a blockchain,"" but with transaction confirmations in under a second and security embedded, as users can always ""fall back to [on a] blockchain"" in the worst-case scenario.  Still, it's early days for the idea. Shi said the company has only just incorporated, and it's not clear if the protocol will be purely private, or open to the public. Today, a website isn't even live, and there's no mention of a roadmap for the project.  But while the concept may seem a little fresh, Shi put forth a compelling case that the work could be one to watch as it evolves toward maturity.  And as Shi reminded the audience:  ""Simplicity is your good friend, especially for large scale distributed systems.""
