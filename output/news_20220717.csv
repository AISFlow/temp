Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin falls under $21K; ether is flat.  Insights: The initial coin offering crypto crash of 2018 can’t happen in 2022.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.

Bitcoin was recently trading at about $20,800, down more than a percentage point over the past 24 hours, although still higher than it stood before starting its mini-rally on Wednesday. Market observers see the crypto continuing to trade in the $18,000 to $22,000 range that it has maintained for a month, at least until investors have a clearer sign whether central banks can lick inflation without casting the global economy into recession.  ""While bitcoin saw positive momentum this week, it remains range-bound when you take a broader view, and is still struggling to cross the $22,000 resistance,"" Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, wrote to CoinDesk.  DiPasquale noted optimistically that ""BTC managed to stay strong,"" despite the recent gloomy inflation report that affected stocks and other high-risk assets. ""For now, we remain interested in the bottom of this range when it comes to Bitcoin's price, and are monitoring for accumulation during this range-bound movement.""  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was recently changing hands at roughly $1,350, flat over the same period. Most other major altcoins were in the red with UNI and AAVE off approximately 2.5% and 3%, respectively.  Cryptos veered slightly from stocks' path as major indexes closed solidly in the green on Friday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a heavy tech component, climbing 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising over 2%. The gains reversed some ground lost earlier in the week as investors tried to reconcile the latest data showing inflation still on the march and disappointing earnings among major brands in a range of industries with more encouraging signs that the global economy may not be cratering anytime soon.  Hot inflation  On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' consumer price index showed June inflation rising 9.1%, a 40-year high, with core goods and services, such as food and energy rising at an even faster rate. The University of Michigan's widely watched, monthly consumer sentiment index remained near its all-time low in its most recent release Friday.  Yet, the job market and retail spending have remained strong, indicating that the economy is still expanding.  Crypto news remained largely bleak, even without the continued afflictions of crypto lender Celsius Network, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Wednesday, and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy earlier this month.  Among other, more recent developments, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law banning digital payments across the nation, according to a policy amendment on Thursday. The legislation prohibits the use of digital securities and utility tokens as a means of payment for goods, services and products in Russia.  BitBull's DiPasquale will be eyeing the possible impact of the U.S. Federal Reserve's expected interest rate hike later this month on bitcoin pricing. The bank's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, meets next Tuesday and Wednesday and is widely expected to raise interest rates by at least 75 basis points in its quest to stem inflation.  ""If bitcoin does not break down from this range by the end of the month, especially post the FOMC [meeting], we could see it as a strong sign of a potential long-term bottom,"" DiPasquale wrote.  Insights  Here’s Why the ICO Crypto Crash of 2018 Can’t Happen in 2022  Digital assets crashed hard in 2018 as a result of the bursting of the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) bubble. As students of crypto history know, once ICO projects finished their token sale they converted their treasury to dollars, and this rapid glut of bitcoin and ether on the market crashed prices leading to the crypto winter of 2018-2019.  Those who had a broad portfolio of these ICO tokens and HODL’ed them through the dark days of that crypto winter came out well ahead, beating the stock market, even high-growth tech stocks that had their best days between 2018-2020, by a mile.  But there were also plenty of retail investors that got burned. Not just on fraudulent tokens – of which there were many – but on the rapid plummeting of crypto prices.  A big part of the crash, and subsequent winter, was that the infrastructure at the time wasn’t very sophisticated compared to what’s available now. As bad as the market correction of 2022 is, what happened in 2017-2018 was minuscule as far as market capitalization goes.  “The environment in the current crypto ecosystem vastly differs from the heyday of ICOs in 2018,"" Singapore-based Danny Chong, co-founder of DeFi protocol Tranchess, told CoinDesk. ""Market maturity has driven the need to establish stronger technological foundations to be laid which have enabled exchanges and [decentralized finance] protocols to provide a variety of products, with lending, bridging and liquid staking abilities, to reduce price fluctuations.”  Chong also points to the availability of more blockchain ecosystems beyond Ethereum that help shield the market from such rapid declines as experienced during the days of ICOs.  “Although the perceived domino effect hasn't changed since the ICO crash, the impact felt by institutions and retail investors is relatively less in 2022,"" he said.  One key piece of infrastructure that didn’t exist during the ICO bubble was automated market makers (AMM). These autonomous trading mechanisms are more efficient than a centralized order book, and prevent price slippage, by providing a readily available pool of deep liquidity to traders.  When a seller can’t find a buyer on a centralized marketplace, the price keeps dropping until there’s a match. AMMs would slow down this price slippage by providing liquidity to absorb the sale acting as a counterparty. This liquidity could be used for future transactions, or redistributed to other pools.  Right now, Uniswap has around $3.6 billion in value locked across dozens of pools, with most major digital assets represented.  “AMM models continue to improve over time and are more efficient than order book algorithms,” a person identifying themselves as ""Puff,"" who claims to be the lead contributor to the DeFi protocol Iron Bank, told CoinDesk. “DeFi has had five years to showcase its ability to handle volatility in both directions.”  And where was the genesis of most of these protocols? The crypto winter that chilled the market after the ICO crash. One has to wonder what will be built during this market downturn.

Throughout the case, Ripple’s native token, XRP, has not seen any progressive growth. This stagnation in its price move has lingered even before the emergence of the extreme crypto winter. But things seem to be taking a dramatic twist for XRP recently. With the ruling of the case, the price of XRP is positively waking. Also, the crypto coin is gradually becoming the leading choice for most BSC whales. Related Reading | Bitcoin Funding Rate Turns Highly Positive, Long Squeeze In The Making? XRP has shown more stability amid the collapse in the broader crypto space. It’s among the rare tokens that have not demonstrated a massive swing in value. Within 30 days, the XRP price has displayed a 1% marginal increase. This impressive trend is quite the opposite of the king of crypto Bitcoin. The price of BTC has dipped by almost 10% within the same period. WhaleStats showed that XRP has suddenly risen as one of the most used smart contract tokens. It noted that this trend has persisted over the last 24 hours among the 1,000 and 500 BSC whales. Also, the record from the firm displayed that the top 2,000 huge investors on BSC hold large XRP tokens worth about $15.09 million. Following the announcement of the long-running lawsuit between Ripple and SEC, the hike in the whale activities for XRP heightened. Through Judge Netburn’s pronouncement, the court has denied SEC’s assertions over Himan’s ETH speech. Also, the commission received the court’s mandate to produce all relevant internal documents. The court order stated that the commission is expected to submit the two proposed redactions to enable in-camera review by the court. Ripple’s attorney noted that the SEC could appeal the court’s decision to Judge Torres. Also, the SEC could demand up to one or two weeks as an extension for filing the objection.

42421493,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoUwP,1658069400,"Bitcoin’s Up, Gold’s Down, the Euro Is Dragging – and It’s All Inexorably Tied","The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released the consumer price index (CPI), the “inflation number,” for June this week. So macro trends are this week’s featured flavor because the CPI number wasn’t exactly pretty. From the press release:  “Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 9.1 percent before seasonal adjustment.”  So if you’re an American who didn’t get a 9.1% pay raise last year (which most didn’t), then everything is more expensive. If you dig into what made up that 9.1%, the really important stuff (read: food, energy) outpaced it. Food prices rose 10.4%, Energy prices were up 41.6%.  Of course, that means gold, the classic inflation hedge asset, should be going up. Except it didn’t? And bitcoin … did. Also the euro is a dollar stablecoin now. What gives?  That (and maybe more …) below.  – George Kaloudis  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  I’ll spend a lot of space in this newsletter on a soapbox because inflation really annoys me. But also because as a son of a Greek immigrant, I find the euro to be really annoying. And gold as a monetary asset never really made sense to me. Plus, I really like Bitcoin.  Since a lot of things have been said about all of these things recently, there’s a lot for me to latch onto and get worked up about.  So here it goes.  No, inflation is not ‘good for you’ and no, we don’t ‘need it’  “Inflation is good for you.” Google it. Real-life articles have been published that claim this.  And they’re serious.  Inflation is good for you because it favors debtors. That makes sense. If you have a $100,000 loan, that $100,000 doesn’t adjust as things get more expensive. It’s still $100,000. So if that $100,000 is a fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage, then your debt burden is lessened.  Assuming of course that your wages increased enough to make up for the fact that burritos are more expensive. For the record, wages largely didn’t increase enough in the U.S. So while inflation might be good for your mortgage burden, does it make up for the additional 40% you’re paying at the gas pump or the additional 10% for burritos?  “We need inflation.” Google that too. Plenty of articles.  All serious.  The basic gist of the argument for needing inflation is that a deflationary currency – one that increases in value over time rather than decreases – will lead to excess saving (or “hoarding”) and lack of spending in the economy given the time value of money (TVM). TVM is the core tenet of finance. A “dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow” given the earning potential of that dollar.  Except.  That's a whiteboard world. In the real world, there’s nothing wrong with saving. Also – and this should be shocking to absolutely nobody – people buy things because they either a) need them or b) want them. While they may be doing a TVM calculation implicitly, no one is pulling out a HP-12C to decide if they do want guac on their burrito.  Is anything an inflation hedge?  There’s a really good theoretical argument for the fixed-rate 30-year mortgage mentioned in the previous section as an effective inflation hedge (but don’t give Wall Street any ideas … again). But normally gold is touted as the ultimate inflation hedge. Gold has been money for millennia and it’s relatively rare. And it’s difficult to produce more gold. So in times of high inflation, we expect gold to increase commensurately.  Except now we have gold 2.0 in bitcoin. Here’s how both have fared since the June CPI was announced.  Bitcoin told gold: “Look at me, I am the captain now.”  I know this is a very short, cherry-picked time period, but it’s pretty profound. Bitcoin is finally doing that thing you’d expect it to do as gold 2.0. Maybe bitcoin can be an inflation hedge after all.  Read more: Bitcoin: Gold 2.0? Try Reserve Asset 3.0  Introducing crypto’s newest dollar stablecoin: the euro  Last week, for the first time in 20 years, the euro hit parity with the U.S. dollar. CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole wrote a great article about what that might mean for crypto markets. In the article, Genesis Global Trading’s Noelle Acheson (my former boss) was quoted saying that bitcoin has been “negatively correlated with the dollar index the past couple of years.”  So far this year, this trend has held up. The dollar index has performed extraordinarily well (up 12.3%), the euro compared with the dollar hasn’t (-10.8%), and not-to-be-upstaged bitcoin has done even worse (-56.1%).  Setting aside both crypto and my negative bias against the euro and its troika (which so graciously bailed out Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Greece) for a moment, it will be interesting to see what the European Central Bank will do in the face of a weakening euro, looming gas shortages, increasing energy prices and an impending recession. Hard times in the eurozone might beget hard times elsewhere.  For all of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s woes, at least he isn’t ECB President Christine Lagarde.  What does this have to do with bitcoin and crypto?  Thankfully (unthankfully?) it’s 2022. And in 2022, bitcoin is a real macro asset. So all of the things that happen in the broader economy affect bitcoin. The Hard Times in crypto that I wrote about the last few weeks may become Harder Times if things in the economy get worse.  Sure, bitcoin could be a way to opt out of the current financial system and get away from inflation and poorly run monetary unions.

7335,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=241173,1658019044,Here’s How C-Stores Can Push for Mass Crypto Adoption,"Cryptocurrencies have been around for some time, and while they are growing more mainstream, there is a lingering sense that a larger portion of society still considers them to be nothing more than oddities. Crypto is money, and the aim of money is to facilitate trade and investment. But money becomes less valuable if it can only be used within a small circle or if its reach is minimal. Digital currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC)and Ether (ETH) have gone beyond the point of mass awareness; most people have heard about them. But the magic phrase being whispered around the corridors of crypto right now is “mass adoption.” The widespread use of virtual money for everyday payments is the next frontier that crypto needs to conquer. What is Mass Crypto Adoption? Mass crypto adoption means that governments worldwide have created enabling environments for it to flourish, that the man in the street has become aware of crypto’s utility, and that businesses have taken note and are monetizing the opportunity. Several things are required for mass adoption to become a reality in crypto. First, there needs to be awareness. Thankfully, the initial coin offering (ICO) craze of a couple of years ago ensured that many people got to know about digital assets in general and cryptocurrencies in particular. The second thing needed for mass crypto adoption to become a reality is institutional adoption to pave the way for political and regulatory acceptance. Finally, crypto requires a seamless end-to-end experience for individuals and corporate entities to transact without having to go through the ordeal of converting digital money into acceptable fiat at the point of exchange. This last phase will require a combination of flawless user experiences, accessible technologies, and merchant acceptance. This is where c-stores, or convenience stores, can come in to play a major role in mass crypto adoption. C-Stores Ideally Placed to Push Mass Crypto Adoption Convenience stores are essential to daily living in much of the developed world. For instance, at least 93 percent of Americans live within 10 minutes of the nearest c-store, which could be anything from a 7-Eleven to a local “mom-and-pop” station. In February, Crypto.com released the results of a survey that found only 4 percent of merchants around the world accepted cryptocurrencies as payment. However, nearly 60 percent were interested in accepting payments within the following year. In comparison, about 40 percent of customers worldwide are already paying with cryptocurrency, while another 60 percent indicated they would like to settle their bills using virtual cash within the next 12 months. The report also showed that c-stores were tied with luxury goods sellers as the industries most likely to use cryptocurrencies. There is tremendous untapped potential for crypto acceptance within the c-store space. And with such a wide footprint, many believe c-stores could be the key to unlocking mass crypto adoption. Convenience stores are widespread, accessible, and easy to navigate. They supply customers with services that are both necessary and repetitive. By accepting crypto, these establishments can broaden their business models while exposing a wider variety of individuals to the potential advantages of digital currencies. Bitcoin ATMs Most c-stores are good locations for ATMs, and one of the newest advancements in the crypto industry is the Bitcoin ATM (BTM). This machine resembles conventional cash-based ATMs in design. It is often contained in a kiosk equipped with a pin pad and screen and positioned in a high-traffic area. The primary distinction is that people can buy BTC and other major cryptocurrencies directly from the machine. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are now more than 38,000 BTMs worldwide. That’s a lot of machines, but it’s still not enough considering there are more than 150,000 convenience stores and about 40,000 grocery stores in the United States alone. If even half of these retailers put up BTMs or coin conversion kiosks at their establishments, they would exponentially increase the visibility and usability of crypto. Major C-Store Chains Now Accepting Crypto Payments In May 2021, Sheetz became the first c-store chain to accept in-store crypto payments. The Altoona-based company, which operates about 625 convenience stores across the United States, partnered with payment technology provider Flexa to enable customers to pay for goods inside the store or to fill up their tanks at the forecourt using a host of digital currencies. In Australia, On The Run (OTR), another major c-store chain, now allows customers to pay for the fuel at more than 170 locations. OTR’s parent company, the Peregrine Corporation, also accepts crypto at a number of its other subsidiaries, including Oporto, Subway, and Smokemart. The list of retailers accepting digital currencies is much longer than most people know and includes major stores such as Lowe’s, Whole Foods, Regal Cinema, and Petco. Conclusion C-stores are innumerable, close to consumers, and are more … Continued The post Here’s How C-Stores Can Push for Mass Crypto Adoption appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform .",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | ICO,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | ICO | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/how-c-stores-can-drive-mass-crypto-adoption/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=how-c-stores-can-drive-mass-crypto-adoption,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png
