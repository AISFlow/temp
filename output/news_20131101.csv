42425118,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHr15h,1383338263,Dark Wallet launches crowdfunding campaign,"A crowdfunding page has been launched for the anarchic Dark Wallet project.  Described on the indiegogo crowdfunding page as a ""light browser wallet relying on an independent bitcoin implementation with out-of-the-box security and privacy features"", Dark Wallet is scheduled for release in early 2014.  The campaign launched yesterday (31st October) and has already reached over 40% of its goal to raise $50,000 for the development of Dark Wallet.  Those involved in the project include Amir Taaki, developer of Libbitcoin; Mihai Alisie, editor in chief at Bitcoin Magazine; and Cody Wilson, who is behind the 3D printable gun component company Defense Distributed.  Dark Wallet asserts that it needs to raise $50,000 in order to complete the development and testing of its product.  The indiegogo page reads:  ""We are interested in scaling up the bitcoin infrastructure in an intentionally subversive and empowering direction- taking bitcoin just where it has been threatening to go. Towards an integrity of values, and a neutrality promoted by anonymity and a resistance to censorship. Software can stand for something.""  The page shows that one person has already donated $5,000 in return for the 'Patron Pack', which includes ""complimentary swag"" and a flight to Europe for one weekend as the guest of Amir and Cody.  What do you make of the Dark Wallet project?

42425106,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHr0rh,1383323478,Founder of Liberty Reserve admits guilt and faces 75 years in prison,"Vladimir Kats, one of the co-founders of digital currency service Liberty Reserve has pleaded guilty to a number of charges including money laundering, marriage fraud and receiving child pornography.  The 41-year-old from Brooklyn, New York issued his plea at a federal court before US district judge Denise L. Cote yesterday (31st October).  Many of the charges he faced related to his role in running Liberty Reserve, which allegedly laundered more than $6bn in suspected proceeds of crimes.  If Kats receives the maximum sentence for each charge, he faces 75 years behind bars.  Acting assistant attorney general Mythili Raman said: “Vladimir Kats, by his own admission, helped to create and operate an anonymous digital currency system that provided cybercriminals and others with the means to launder criminal proceeds on an unprecedented scale.""  She went on to say Kats' conviction shows that action will be taken against banking systems that allow criminals to conduct illegal transactions anonymously.  ""Professional money launderers will be brought to justice,"" she added.  Yesterday, Kats pleaded guilty to the following:  One count of conspiring to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison  One count of conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison  One count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison  One count of receiving child pornography, which carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison  One count of marriage fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.  A sentencing date has not yet been scheduled.  The beginnings  Liberty Reserve was incorporated in Costa Rica in 2006, and was allegedly created to help users launder the proceeds of their crimes. For years, it operated one of the world's most widely used digital currencies, which it described as ""instant real-time currency for international commerce"".  The company touted itself as being the Internet's largest payment processor and offered its services to people across the globe including those in the US. In fact, the US government estimates the company had approximately 200,000 users located in America.  However, it failed to register with the US Department of the Treasury as a money transmitting business and was operating without even the basic anti-money laundering controls, such as know-your-customer procedures.  The indictment relating to Kats' arrest describes Liberty Reserve as follows:  ""A financial hub of the cyber-crime world, facilitating a broad range of online criminal activity, including credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, child pornography, and narcotics trafficking.""  It claims that the company processed more than 12 million financial transactions per year – totalling an estimated 55 million between 2006 and 2013, to the tune of $6bn.  According to the indictment, the merchants who accepted Liberty Reserve's currency were ""overwhelmingly criminal in nature"":  “They included, for example, traffickers of stolen credit card data and personal identity information; peddlers of various types of online Ponzi and get-rich-quick schemes; computer hackers for hire; unregulated gambling enterprises; and underground drug-dealing websites.”  The government document ordered the defendants forfeit ""a sum of money of at least $6bn"", plus all funds on deposit in 42 accounts in various countries across the world, including Morocco, Greece, Cyprus, Spain and Latvia. On top of this, the government is seizing up to $36,919,884 from three Westpac Bank accounts in Australia.  The domain names libertyreserve.com, exchangezone.com, swiftexchanger.com, moneycentralmarket.com, asiangold.com and eurogoldcash.com have also been seized.  In the indictment, the role Kats played in the company is detailed as co-director, and it states he also ran multiple Liberty Reserve 'exchanger' services.  Kats' departure  Kats left Liberty Reserve in 2009 following a dispute with co-founder Arthur Budovsky, who also goes by the names of Arthur Belanchuk and Eric Paltz. The site was shut down two years later in May 2013, the same month that Kats was arrested in Brooklyn.  Marco Santori, chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation’s Regulatory Affairs Committee, explained Kat's arrest and his recent guilty plea provides yet more evidence that digital currencies are a terrible tool for money laundering. He said:    ""Liberty Reserve operated a centralized convertible digital currency system that – as the guilty plea now confirms – was used for criminal activity and laundering money.      Decentralized digital currencies like bitcoin, on the other hand, offer unprecedented transparency to public scrutiny.""    Santori went on to say criminals chose Liberty Reserve’s centralized system instead of bitcoin specifically because Liberty Reserve offered the kind of opacity to public investigation that bitcoin has rejected from its infancy.  The charges against Kats' co-defendants are still pending, with a press release from the US Department of Justice stating: ""Those defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2013/11/01/founder-of-liberty-reserve-admits-guilt-and-faces-75-years-in-prison,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d5834983d3d90e68a3dab5363291ca1959fc8cfd-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425123,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHr1Lh,1383319852,"Big names’ big bitcoin bet, bugs bite bright idea, and forgetful fjord fellow finds fame","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 1st November 2013 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.  Circling in for the win    For bitcoin to fly, it needs to be easy to use, feel legitimate and be spendable all over the shop. If you look at the early marketing of credit cards, they went through the same process: card providers hammered home security, simplicity and widespread retail acceptance.      The news that copper-bottomed venture capitalists have raised nine million dollars to set up Circle, a very shiny, very now outfit dedicated to making bitcoin simple for users and companies alike, ticks all those boxes.      With track records in Facebook investment, an industry-standard video distribution company, WalMart board membership and many other VC CV desirables, the team’s about as good as it gets.      Their mission looks spot-on too: creating the tools and the brand to make bitcoin safe and simple.      That’s not too different to what most of the team did at Brightcove, the Internet video creation and distribution company where most of them hail from.      They created tools and a brand that existing media companies felt was a safe and effective way to get their video content online and in the faces of Internet users.      Also, they clearly know how they’ll make money out of the enterprise, which is by no means a given for Internet startups. So, they know what they’re doing.      All this has made Circle instantly legitimate in the eyes of the mainstream media, with the New York Times penning a respectful piece on what they’re up to - and, of course, including a canned round-up of what bitcoin is, how it works and some of its recent history.      Savvy watchers will know that the next step in bitcoin’s acceptance will be when major news stories about the currency come without these educational capsules.      That won’t be long in coming. John Law notes with some satisfaction that BBC radio news ran two bitcoin stories on successive days, albeit with their own little capsules, and that cabbies have started to ask informed questions when they discover their fare writes about the stuff.      The whole momentum is eerily reminiscent of the early days of the Internet: the difference is that, back then, people really didn’t get the idea of public computer networking. Now they do - and they get bitcoin with commendable despatch.      Of course, there’s no substitute for deliverables, and Circle is still in stealth mode over exactly what it’ll be delivering and when it’ll be delivered.      The good thing about bitcoin is that the hard work’s been done - a monkey with a Raspberry Pi can build a bitcoin gizmo between bananas - so the real sweat will have to be poured into top-notch user interfaces, solid infrastructure, marketing and confidence building.      The Circle guys have considerable form in all these areas.      The only potential downside that John Law can foresee is the name. While the name Circle has all the elements of simplicity, wholeness and completion that the brand requires, there is an unfortunate and rather sordid phrase created when you add on the old insult ‘jerk’.      If the boffo brains behind the company do run into any sort of technical or regulatory trouble, that phrase has the potential to stick.      It’s not likely this is keeping them up at night. Developments of a more wholesome nature are eagerly awaited.    What’s in a namecoin?    Unwelcome developments have hit namecoin, one of the various altcoin alternatives to grandaddy bitcoin.      Namecoin’s shtick is that it runs its own domain, .bit, which is entirely independent of the Internet’s own DNS, the Domain Name Service that translates all the human-readable addresses, like coindesk.com, into the numbers the machines use.      Running your own domain service has some great advantages - you get complete control over who gets addresses, and you’re not beholden to any of entities who charge for registration and decide what the rules are.      The major downside, of course, is that if anyone types a .bit address into their browser, it won’t know what to do with it and you won’t connect.      Namecoin fixed that by making some little browser extensions that you can plug into your Firefox or whatever, and voila - full interoperability with total independence.      It’s a great idea. Unfortunately, as the main DNS system knows only too well, it’s not just a matter of setting up a directory system: such things are at the heart of how the Internet works and if they’re attacked, enormous amounts of mischief can take place.      You might think you’re connecting to Mybank.com, but if that’s been hijacked the people taking your credentials may be a bunch of criminals bent on ripping you off instead of a respectable member of the international finance system bent on ripping you off.      The main DNS has seen a lot of attacks and has had to evolve some serious security smarts to defend itself.      Alas, Namecoin has learned this the hard way, with major flaws being discovered by an independent developer who was investigating whether it was safe to start to trade there.      In effect, anyone can hijack any .bit domain. And while the flaw can be fixed, it means that the block chain behind Namecoin’s coin system is no longer trustable - and you can’t just wave a magic binary wand over that.      It’s a salutary lesson in making a system secure, and one that security experts constantly warn about. You’re only as safe as the weakest link in the chain.      While the basic blocks of cryptocoin technology are considered suitably solid, when you come to glue them together you have to make sure that the glue itself is sound. There’s no point in plugging in deity-grade encryption if you let the keys leak out.      Indeed, that’s how the NSA gets to snoop on so much encrypted network traffic: it can’t break the encryption, but it can and has spotted the points where encrypted traffic is decrypted before being used. Tap those, and you get the lot without having to reinvent fundamental mathematics.      Namecoin may well overcome this hurdle: the idea of running an independent domain name service is intriguing, worthwhile and not fundamentally flawed.      If it doesn’t, it’ll be in the same company as the old UK aircraft manufacturer, De Havilland, which built the world’s first jet aircraft, the Comet. Put the UK years ahead of the world. Unfortunately, nobody really understood metal fatigue until after a few Comets had self-destructed in mid-flight.      After that, everyone got the hint - especially Boeing, who got the 707 out while De Havilland was still redesigning their aircraft to not do the falling-out-of-the-sky thing.      Them’s the breaks.    How to make a million by forgetting    Both are real ‘Hey, Maude!’ stories, so-called in the newspaper business because they’re the sort of thing that Harold brings to his missus’ attention over breakfast while she’s buttering the toast and he’s reading the paper.      The ATM story is cool because - look - you can stuff banknotes into a box and get bitcoin out. None of that messing about with online transactions and worrying whether your bank will spot what you’re doing or whether evil hackers will take your dosh.      This is particularly good because while you have to have all sorts of licences and regulatory insight if you want to take one sort of money and give the punters another sort of money, you don’t if you want to operate a vending machine that takes the dosh and hands out things.      As bitcoin isn’t legally money, you can - in Canada at least - pretend your bitcoin ATM is a vending machine and just stuff it in a coffee shop.      OK, so it’s got a palm-scanner to make sure you’re not trading more than $3,000 a day - triggering money laundering rules - or, at least if you are, you have to get a friend or two to stick their hands on the screen as well.      If one of those was in the corner of some bar, you’d stick twenty quid in to start playing, wouldn’t you? Course you would.      Of course, if you were really sensible, you’d have already bought your bitcoin back in 2009, when you could get around three to a penny - or 5,000 for $27.      Then you’d have looked at them in your wallet for a bit, and, seeing they weren’t doing very much, forgotten all about them. Until 2013, when you’d see a news story that a single bitcoin was worth around $200, which might trigger some sort of memory that, hey, didn’t you have a few lying about.      You might have had a few anxious hours while you tried to remember a password from four years ago but - hey - motivation, right?      And then you’d remember, and then you’d be practically a millionaire, and the BBC would be running a story about you. But you’d be a Norwegian called Kristoffer Koch, and you are not that man.      Neither is John Law, although he so easily could have been. He’s not bitter. But if he meets Mr Koch - Kris, dear friend - in a bar, he’ll be prepared to let him pretend to be a bitcoin ATM and buy him a pint of bitter.      $27. Try not to think about it.      $27.    John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler.

42425122,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHr1Jh,1383311375,Western Union: bitcoin isn't ready for international money transfer yet,"Is bitcoin ready for primetime? Presenters at a recent Western Union conference didn’t think so. At its 2013 Consumer Protection & Compliance Conference last month, executives gave a presentation that said it wasn’t yet suitable for international money transfer. Are they right?  “My audience and the discussion for this slide was about retail consumer money transfer – remittances,” said Jay Postma, president of MSB Compliance Inc, a company that consults on compliance issues for money service businesses.  Bitcoin holds great promise for payments and settlement transactions, but it’ll take longer for it to catch on in the remittance market, he maintains.  One of the big sticking points is liquidity, he argues, adding that family support payments can currently only be useful once converted to local fiat currencies.  “We're a long, long way from sending momma in Mexico $240 each month or a Somali family in a refugee camp $200 each month in bitcoin that is held in a wallet for conversion to local fiat currency and spending as needed,” he suggests.  Market movements can hinder transactions between bitcoin and fiat currencies by changing exchange rates too rapidly. And while bitcoin can slide around the world without friction, more people need to support its use natively, say advocates.  JinYoung Englund, director of public affairs for the Bitcoin Foundation, said:  “One could send bitcoins from one person to another, but if everyone who received a bitcoin decided to convert immediately to fiat - we now have a supply and demand problem.""  It’s true, payment processor BitPay has 10,000 merchants under their belt, but more is needed.  “Liquidity is important because currently, most merchants who provide life-sustaining goods such as groceries, gas and utilities have yet to adapt to this new technology,” Englund says.  The other issue that Postma identifies is regulatory. For bitcoins to be converted to wire payments, money transmitters need the ability to convert cash deposits while continuing to meet compliance obligations. They have to do that without endangering relationships with banks.  “The infrastructure and market for money transmitter operators (MTOs) to use BTC as transfer and settlement option is just not here yet. “  For bitcoin to overcome these regulatory challenges, there are several “areas of improvement,” he says.  These include customer identification and due diligence, verifying ownership and control of wallet addresses, and transaction monitoring for fraud.  Bitcoin institutions must prevent transfers that would violate OFAC (Office of Foreign Asset Control) sanctions or the UIGEA (Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act).  Some of this is already happening. Many exchanges are aggressively pursuing KYC and AML measures, in some cases beyond what they think regulators will expect.  But in many cases, they’re doing this in part because they don’t want problems when regulators finally wake up to bitcoin and start pursuing them. Coinfloor’s recent launch is a good example.  Postma warns:  “Perhaps the largest immediate problem for bitcoin exchanges in the U.S. is the inability of those needing state money transmitter licenses to obtain required surety bond coverage.""  And firms still face the challenge of building good banking relationships he adds. Many have fallen afoul of banks that cancel accounts after getting spooked by any association with bitcoin.  Finally, there are issues with the consumer interfaces for bitcoin wallets and other services, Postma warns. He would like to see the ability to send bitcoins via email, and to an IP address, along with the ability to send provisional payments subject to acceptance, and return of funds if not accepted.  He wants security features such as multi-factor authentication, transaction limit setting, and confirmation entry settings.  But again, some of this is already either happening, or in progress. Coinbase already enables bitcoin to be sent via email, and BIPS 70 will introduce some enhancements to payment processes, such as refund addresses, and the ability to send payment requests and certified payments without having to touch a bitcoin address.  Would Western Union ever use bitcoin as the basis for its money transfer services, if it decided that it was ready for primetime? Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase, says that the company may simply be too entrenched.  “They have innovator’s dilemma. It’s hard for them to move on bitcoin because they have all this massive infrastructure invested, with physical locations and agents everywhere,” he argues. He thinks that operating a closed system that they control is a key part of their business model.  That, of course, is where bitcoin and other payment systems that claim to be decentralized differ.  [post-quote]  “The fundamental innovation of these protocols is the ability to process transactions across a distributed architecture,” says Daniel Aranda, director of business development, Ripple. “There's never been a more exciting time to innovate in core areas of our financial infrastructure and improve access and service to millions of people.”  But when? When will bitcoin (or payment systems such as Ripple, for that matter) deserve to be recognized as mainstream?  Eventually, says Roger Ver, an investor in Blockchain.info, bitcoin will be able to do everything better than Western Union's current services, but it will take time for the infrastructure to develop.  “I think we will know when bitcoin has reached prime time when it is transferring more value each day than Western Union or Money Gram,"" he says. “I think we may see that happen within another two years.”  Others have different yardsticks for when bitcoin hits primetime. “Acceptance by major, reputable companies like WordPress and Baidu are beginning indicators of an idea whose time has come,” says Englund.  Baidu’s acceptance of bitcoin may be close to tripping one of Ehrsam’s triggers for a mainstream bitcoin.  He says that a major household name accepting bitcoin (think Amazon, eBay, or perhaps a major phone carrier) would be a good indicator.  Another might be a country undergoing major economic upheaval that becomes unable to trust its currency, and which turns to the cryptocurrency instead.  Bitcoin still faces its challenges, but some of the things that Postma highlighted in his presentation are in progress.  There’s no doubt that bitcoin is a ‘frothy’ business at present, with startups popping up on a weekly basis trying to push the cryptocurrency forward with more merchant options, better tools, and more sophisticated interfaces.  When will you consider it to be a currency ready for primetime? Let us know in the comments below.

42425121,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHr1Hh,1383302735,South American startup Moneero creates SMS bitcoin payment system,"A startup based in Uruguay is looking to make bitcoin easier to use via the widely used SMS platform on cell phones.  Steven Morell, chief programming officer of the company Moneero, told CoinDesk that the plan is to make bitcoin easy for anyone to use. The company estimates that its service can be used on the 6.8bn mobile phones already being used worldwide.  “We want to make it easy and convenient for non-tech savvy people. People who have heard about bitcoin in the news, and would buy it if it were easy for them,"" he said.  Morell points out his mother as someone who is not tech-savvy, but does use Skype, Facebook and a basic cell phone. He says she could use bitcoin with Moneero's platform, and explains how easy it is to do so:  ""Say I have a Moneero account, you type in a phone number, and a bitcoin amount. The moment she answers yes, a bitcoin wallet is created and is visible on the block chain. We are doing an address translation, sort of a DNS [domain name] service for bitcoin.""  Other companies have build bitcoin systems using SMS because of the massive number of phones that can use it. Coinbase, for example, released the ability to send and receive BTC via text message in August.  Moneero's competitive strategy is to provide an easy-to-use bitcoin API, then have developers build off that in order to use it on different systems.  ""This is for SMS, Twitter or any platform,"" said Morell.  The company has also partnered with a company to build a bitcoin ATM, which Moneero calls a Bitcoin Teller Machine, or BTM.  ""We are partnering with existing hardware makers to form our BTM. We have selected someone who has extensive experience in this industry. We started building it, we had to tweak and test a lot of things, and we are taking orders now for this. We have around 80 machines ordered from at least nine countries.""  The BTM is just another extension of Moneero's bitcoin transaction API. Morell says that the company has an advantage because its system is built for various compliance rules in different locales. He said:  ""Our API supports all types of KYC [know your customer] procedures. If you’re a German Moneero user or a California Moneero user, you’ll go through those corresponding procedures. Our API supports all of this. We can adjust to regulations.""  The decision to base the company in Uruguay is a combination of booming bitcoin growth South America, and clarity in terms of the regulatory environment.  ""We are in South America because of the market opportunities. Uruguay is called the Switzerland of South America for a reason. It’s very liberalized here. It’s a country with a very long banking tradition for the reason that all rich people on the continent bring money to Uruguay and you can trust they aren’t going to confiscate or overly tax money,"" Morell explained.  He also says that the United States is not the ideal place for a bitcoin startup because of the financial industry's rules for becoming a money transmitter.  ""You need a lot of money, you need a lot of time and it takes a lot of effort to become a bank if you aren’t already one,"" he said.
