42377774,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73XCH,1415316634,Pockio Expands Crypto Gift Card Service to Germany and France,"UK-based cryptocurrency gift card retailer Pockio has announced its international expansion to Germany and France, with more EU countries to come in the weeks ahead.  The move means that bitcoin and altcoin users in those countries can shop at retailers not yet accepting digital currencies.    Initially, the platform opens up companies such as Amazon.fr and Amazon.de, Steam and Skype to European mainland cryptocurrency consumers.      ""Over the coming weeks we plan to roll out more gift cards for our EU customers who, as in the UK, are looking for quick and easy ways to use their digital currencies day-to-day,"" CEO Bradley Roberts told CoinDesk, adding:      ""We’ll be targeting places with thriving cryptocurrency communities like the Netherlands, Scandinavia and Slovenia, that have really embraced bitcoin in particular.""              However, while France recently got its own bitcoin advocacy centre, La Maison du Bitcoin, the country doesn't yet have a notable bitcoin scene. Roberts is not discouraged, indicating that in time this will change.      He said:      ""Bitcoin recognition and adoption has been consistently growing as the technology and concepts become easier to use and as coverage in the media has increased and this holds true globally ... As such, places like Germany and France, with large economies and populations will become significant, market players in the long-term as they discover the benefits of digital currencies.""            UK retailer list grows  Pockio  also announced today that it has added a number of new retailers to its UK platform.  The firm now boasts 177 retailers accessible from Britain, such as Amazon, the Google Play store, Marks & Spencer and Spotify. Big-name new additions to its roster include Ryan Air, American Apparel, H Samuel and Zynga.  Along with the addition of extra gift cards, Pockio has also improved its platform, cutting the order wait time. Orders can now be processed after just one confirmation on the bitcoin network, meaning that cards are delivered much sooner.  Additionally, the checkout process has been simplified to make buying with cryptocurrencies a more user friendly experience.    ""Once you’ve got to grips with how to buy bitcoin in the first place, spending it is as easy as it would be at any other online store,"" said Roberts.      He explained:      ""Pockio’s service is fast and getting faster as we’ve worked very hard to reduce delivery times for gift cards. This has been a really important factor for our customers ... Eventually we want to be able to say that you will be able to buy absolutely anything you normally would with bitcoin.""            Bridging the gap  Launched in January 2014, Pockio was, at the time, the first British service to exchange retailer gift cards for digital currencies. Notably its original roster of eight cryptocurrencies accepted has now increased to 15, including dogecoin, litecoin and feathercoin, along with bitcoin.  While there are a number of US-based cryptocurrency gift card companies, such as Gyft and eGifter, the European market is still very small, with just the likes of Crypto de Change preventing Pockio having the region all to itself.  However, Roberts indicated his firm may eventually enter the American market too, saying:  ""Our plan, ultimately, is to expand to other continents like the US, where again, demand for somewhere to utilise digital currencies other than bitcoin is growing, but currently there are few options for people.""  ""It is early days for many countries, but we firmly believe that bitcoin and the technology behind it is revolutionary,"" he concluded. ""The financial industry is ripe for disruption, so adoption of these new currencies is only a matter of time.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | DOGE | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/06/pockio-expands-crypto-gift-card-service-to-germany-and-france,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1476495796ef264bbf71fad52f2eef58c760f8b1-1205x730.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377769,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73X5z,1415311503,Bitcoin Ponzi Schemer Charged With Criminal Securities Fraud,"Trendon Shavers, a Texas man who ran a scam investment scheme called Bitcoin Savings and Trust, has been arrested in his home state.  The charges filed against Shavers today are one count of securities fraud and one of wire fraud, with each having a maximum penalty of 20 years and potential fines totaling upwards of $5m.  Shavers, 32, has already been fined $40m by a federal judge in north Texas in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) -related case. This arrest is for criminal charges of fraud brought by the US Attorney in Manhattan.  Bitcoin Savings and Trust  By using the online monikers 'Pirate' and 'pirateat40', Shavers allegedly sold bitcoin investment opportunities on various online forums.  Calling his scheme Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BTCST), Shavers promised a 7% return per week to potential investors.  Shavers was able to amass over 700,000 BTC over a period of time stretching from September 2011 to September 2012, working on the scam from his home in McKinney, TX. The value of the bitcoin at the time of Shavers' initial SEC charges was approximately $64m.  The US Attorney's Office in Manhattan claims 48 of the 100 investors in the BTCST scam lost some or all of their money.  Officials on the lookout  Shavers' previous SEC case in North Texas created precedent when his attorney claimed bitcoin was not subject to US securities laws that prohibit Ponzi schemes. The judge in that case, however, ruled that the scam had indeed violated those laws, which are designed to protect investors from fraud.  Earlier this year, officials in Texas issued a warning in regards to virtual currencies. Joseph Rotunda, director of enforcement at the Texas State Securities Board, indicated that bitcoin has huge trust issues because of little regulatory clarity.  At today's bitcoin prices, the roughly 700,000 BTC Shavers apparently scammed from investors would be worth $243m.

42377779,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73XIZ,1415310058,Gavin Andresen Rejects Bitcoin Centralisation Concerns at Web Summit,"The Bitcoin Foundation's chief scientist Gavin Andresen has given his opinions on a variety of issues at this year's Web Summit – an annual event held in Dublin, Ireland, that attracted more than 20,000 attendees this year.  The summit has established itself as an important date on the calendars of technology investors, startups and even rock stars, like U2 frontman Bono, who attends regularly.  Andresen gave a wide-ranging interview to the Wall Street Journal's Lisa Fleisher, at the event's 'Centre Stage', discussing the centralisation in mining, regulation by governments and the future of digital currencies.  Cycles of centralisation  Creeping centralisation, particularly among miners, is likely to occur in ""waves"", Andresen said, adding that this would mirror the pattern seen in computing in general.  He said:  ""Centralisation of mining is going to go in waves. Now you see economies of scale for companies that create huge mining farms where electricity is inexpensive. Once those [ASIC] chips become commodities and inexpensive, you'll see it decentralise again.""  Andresen likened the cycles of centralisation by miners to earlier computing technologies that saw rapid cost declines over the time, leading to reduced reliance on centralised structures.  ""When I was in college in the 80s, we were at the cusp of going from mainframe computers to personal computers,"" he said. ""I worked in tech support, and the biggest wave of tech support requests happened around the time theses were due. People from campus would send their theses to this laser printer and then come and pick them up. That's what computing used to be.""  Andresen added:  ""It was very centralised, and then the PC revolution happened and everyone had a PC.""  Andresen graduated from Princeton University in 1988, majoring in computer science.  Nodes numbers not a concern  When asked about other weaknesses in decentralisation on the bitcoin network, such as the declining number of nodes, Andresen was similarly unbothered.  He told assembled journalists at a press conference after his onstage appearance:  ""The technology is still so early ... it doesn't really concern me much. Right now we have 7,000 nodes. It's a good number. If it was 700 or 70, I would be more worried. We're still a couple of orders of magnitude away from where it would be a problem.""  He indicated that changes are underway on the technical side that would make it much easier to run a full node, but explained ""we've simply had other priorities"".  Andresen also addressed the issue of regulation of digital currencies by governments, welcoming the attention that governments have given to cryptocurrencies in recent months and even expressing sympathy for regulators who have to grapple with the complexities of creating a framework for bitcoin.  ""Regulators have a hard job,"" he said. ""They have to react to this new technology and try to fit it into laws that were passed 40, 50, or 100 years ago. It's really a struggle for them.""  Need for balanced regulation  Andresen stressed that attention from regulators would be essential to bitcoin's mass adoption. However, regulators will now have to be careful not to get heavy-handed with digital currency.  He said:  ""Getting regulatory clarity is really important. In the last year, year and a half, we've seen more regulatory clarity. I think it's been incredibly positive for bitcoin, but now we need regulation that isn't going to kill innovation.""  Andresen singled out China and Russia as states that have approached bitcoin regulation too severely.  ""Certain countries around the world take a much stricter approach ... countries such as China and Russia have been really anti-bitcoin recently. Their first impulse is to ban something and, if they think it's good, they'll allow it,"" he said.  Andresen highlighted BitX's efforts to raise bitcoin donations to combat the spread of ebola and bitcoin ATMs as worthy ways of increasing awareness around the digital currency.  ""Bitcoin ATMs are a wonderful thing. I'd love to go to a bitcoin ATM here in Dublin and get some euros ... I could really see that taking off and taking bitcoin mainstream because international use of bitcoin will be the first mainstream place where it happens,"" he said.

42377764,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73Wzh,1415306716,Gallery: Fire Destroys Thai Bitcoin Mining Facility,"UPDATE (10th November 12:04 GMT): A source from Cowboyminers has now clarified the date and time of the fire: 14th October at 04:30am local time.  UPDATE (10th November 10:40 GMT): A previous version of this article stated that the bitcoin hash rate dropped following the outage. This has been removed awaiting further confirmation from sources concerning the exact date of the blaze. More to follow.      A bitcoin mining facility in Thailand was destroyed in a massive fire last month and foul play has not been ruled out, according to a local source.  The 5-megawatt farm was operated by mining cooperative Cowboyminers and primarily relied on Spondoolies-Tech and Innosilicon hardware, with some additional miners from BitFury and Gridseed.  Cowboyminers was formed by a group of European expats living in Bangkok, who tried to maintain a low profile, but at the same time operated a relatively extensive mining operation.  Extensive damage  According to Cowboyminers, the blaze started at 4:30am on 14th October, when just two people were at the facility.  Local media reports that the fire raged out of control for more than 30 minutes and, while no injuries were reported in the incident, damage was extensive.  Spondoolies-Tech confirmed that much of the hardware used in the facility was sourced from them.  The manufacturer's CEO, Guy Corem, told CoinDesk that he had visited the site in late June, when it was primarily populated by about 1,000 Dragon miners and around 100 Spondoolies-Tech miners.  Corem said the facility was expanded shortly after his visit, with hundreds of Spondoolies-Tech SP30 miners. These had operated for more than two months without incident and technical data indicates they were cooled properly, he added.  'Kosher' operation  There has been no official word on the extent of damage suffered by the facility. It is estimated that the farm housed upwards of 2,000 miners when it was destroyed, including about $2m-worth from Spondoolies-Tech alone.  Corem described the cooperative as a good and serious client:  “I want to add that they're legit customers who paid for the equipment with BTC. I know some of the people involved other businesses. All kosher.”  He stressed that his company is helping the cooperative recover and salvage some of the hardware that was not completely destroyed in the blaze.  “I can't estimate the total damage, but it's considerable. All the build-up was done from bitcoins the cooperative held,” said Corem.  He dismissed allegations that the miners were not properly installed, confirming that the SP30 units were designed to be stacked and that cooling was not an issue.  However, Spondoolies-Tech did not survey the site after the SP30s were installed and it could not vouch for the quality of the facility’s own AC wiring. The operators of the facility allegedly told the miner manufacturer that they did not rush the installation of new miners and that they had used the cables provided with the SP30 machines.  Arson not ruled out  The cause of the fire remains unclear, with local media reports suggesting it could have been a simple short-circuit.  Arson is another possibility that has not been ruled out, however. One facility operator indicated that it might have been an “external source” and that no short-circuit had occurred, saying:  ""There was absolutely no failure anywhere, no wiring failure. It wasn’t damaged, it was fine. The only cables you see are the power cables of the miners themselves ... The electrical system was working, there was no short and there is no short even now.""  The source, who wishes to remain anonymous, said the miners continued running even as the buildings were engulfed in flames – failing one by one. He also indicated that the adhesive holding the acoustic foam in place may have helped propagate the blaze:  ""It is the only reason the fire could spread. We left a huge empty space, 30–40 metres with no miners at all and then another 10–15 metres to the next building.""  The operator also suggested that ventilation inlets could have fueled the fire and helped it spread. In all, three buildings were engulfed, two of which subsequently collapsed.  The facility and the machines, which had been paid for in bitcoin generated from the mining operation, was not insured. However, the representative said it has enough resources to get back on its feet.  ""We had zero insurance. Everything is our own money,"" he said. ""We are early adopters and we are not new to mining.""

42377782,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73XHJ,1415298911,SumUp Brings No-Fee Bitcoin Transactions to European Merchants,"SumUp has integrated bitcoin into its mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) solution, allowing merchants across Europe to offer the payment option without paying any transaction fees through 2015.  Enabled through an integration with BitPay, SumUp boasts that it now provides the first mPOS solution powered by its bitcoin payment processing partner in Europe. In turn, BitPay framed the partnership as the latest evidence it will reach its target of enlisting 1 million merchants on its platform by 2017.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Marc Christ CSO and co-founder of SumUp emphasized that the decision is one that finds the mobile payments company embracing a broad array of new and alternative payment solutions, from bitcoin to Apple Pay.  Christ said:  ""We really want to enable our merchants to accept all kinds of payments. There's a lot of new payment options out there, but we saw that bitcoin is probably the most advanced at the moment, so we decided to first to learn how bitcoin can enable interaction between the consumer and the merchant.""  Launched in 2011, SumUp has raised $33m in investment to date, allowing it to compete with the number of European mPOS solutions, including iZettle and Payleven, that have proliferated in the wake of Square's international success.  SumUp said it has no plans to introduce fees on the service until the end of next year, but that such costs could be added at a later date.  ""We will evaluate the need for fees, but they might very well stay at 0% also thereafter,"" Christ explained.  Keeping costs low  Existing SumUp merchants interested in adopting the new payment method can now opt-in to the service.  At checkout, customers are presented with a bitcoin QR code, which then allows them to select a wallet for payment. SumUp uses BitPay's instant confirmation tools, so that merchants can settle payment in just a few seconds, the company said.  ""BitPay calls our back-end and our back-end connects with the merchant apps, and it all takes a few seconds. It's faster than a credit card,"" SumUp senior Android developer Dirk Jäckel said.  Developer Gustav Simonsson went on to say that SumUp had wanted to preserve what it considers to be one of bitcoin's main benefits – low-cost transactions, explaining:  ""We realized that since BitPay charges no fees at all, we had a unique opportunity to also charge no fees, in turn passing on this to our merchants.""  The only cost for payments completed through SumUp will be a miners' fee paid by the end customer.  Inspired by developers  Like many companies, SumUp indicated that it was inspired to adopt bitcoin payments by its own developers, who were intrigued by the technology.  In this case, Christ said it was Simonsson and Jäckel who convinced him – and by extension the company – that bitcoin ""was the greatest thing"".  The two developers began to take an interest in bitcoin in 2013, discovering the technology as it rose in value. Eventually, this interest led to hands-on experience, when the developers created the early prototype for SumUp's current bitcoin solution at a hackathon hosted at its Dublin office in the summer of last year.  ""During that weekend, we produced a working prototype, but there was no plan to put that product into production,"" Jäckel said. ""It was a very rough prototype.""  Notably, the developers initially used the Coinbase API, which they reported as being ""a bit rough around the edges"".  Jäckel added:  ""It was very much just a quick hack, but it was working and I think we even had NFC.""  Christ reported that he was personally impressed by what the developers had achieved, but that the company was focused at the time on developing its chip-and-PIN card reader.  ""Now that that is live and very successfully employed, we had the opportunity to do this again and the hackathon made it all the way into production,"" Christ said.  A final version of the integration was completed this October, over a three-day period.  Strong customer feedback  Christ indicated that he is excited by a number of new payment technologies, but that for SumUp, technology is only useful if it will be used by the end consumer.  To date, Christ said he has been pleasantly surprised by the number of new sign-ups, estimating that 100 merchants have so far enrolled because of the new bitcoin payment option.  Still, he suggested that SumUp won't go to lengths to promote bitcoin to customers who may not benefit from the option.  For example, Christ said that while the company was able to test the solution with enthusiastic merchants in the tech hotbed of Berlin, its customers in more rural areas may not have a compelling reason to accept bitcoin just yet.  Christ said  ""We don't want to push bitcoin on you if you don't have any customers. We want customers to push merchants to add the service.""  BitPay advances in Europe  The news can also be seen as a boon for BitPay's European strategy, as the addition of a major name in emerging payments technology is likely to reverberate in a merchant market that is still warming to bitcoin.  BitPay's Moe Levin said:  ""Leveraging a payment service provider's existing merchants, as opposed to taking on merchants one at a time through our sign-up process, gives us the ability to scale incredible quickly and reliably.""  He went on to suggest that BitPay intends to stay focused on acquiring new merchants in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK – areas where SumUp has so far been able to assist with merchant enrolment.  Going forward, Levin hinted that similar future partnerships could be in the works, adding that BitPay is seeking to partner with ""the most important payment services providers"" in an effort to scale its presence in the region.

42377777,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73XEn,1415293489,"Silk Road 2.0 Seized, Alleged Operator Unmasked in FBI Crackdown","The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) together with the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York have announced that they have arrested 'Defcon', the operator of illicit black market website Silk Road 2.0.  At press time, the Silk Road 2.0 marketplace was no longer operational, with the website displaying a disclaimer that it had been taken down by Europol, Eurojust, the FBI, US Department of Justice and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  Authorities arrested 26-year-old San Francisco native Blake Benthall yesterday in his home city. He will appear in federal court today to face charges for activities he allegedly perpetrated while running the website.  In statements  , Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara called Silk Road 2.0 a ""nearly identical criminal enterprise"" to its predecessor, Silk Road, which was seized and shut down in October 2013 following the arrest of its alleged operator Ross Ulbricht. Silk Road 2.0 has sought to provide an open, bitcoin-enabled online marketplace in the wake of Silk Road's shutdown.  Bharara affirmed the position of law enforcement officials, that those who operate such websites will be charged provided they allow crime to proliferate:  ""Let’s be clear – this Silk Road, in whatever form, is the road to prison. Those looking to follow in the footsteps of alleged cybercriminals should understand that we will return as many times as necessary to shut down noxious online criminal bazaars. We don’t get tired.”  ""The FBI worked with law enforcement partners here and abroad on this case and will continue to investigate and bring to prosecution those who seek to run similar black markets online,"" FBI assistant director-in-charge George Venizelos added.  The full report from the FBI alleges that Silk Road 2.0 was used by ""thousands of drug dealers"", with ""launder millions of dollars"" generated by the ""unlawful transactions"" it processed. Law enforcement officials estimate Silk Road 2.0 was generating $8m per month in sales from 150,000 active users as of September of this year.  ""The offerings on Silk Road 2.0 consisted overwhelmingly of illegal drugs, which were openly advertised as such on the site,"" the statement reads.  The FBI said that a Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agent was able to infiltrate the website, gaining access to ""private, restricted areas of the site reserved for Benthall and his administrative staff"". HSI further claimed that it interacted with Benthall during his operation of the site.  Ongoing global crackdown  At least two more arrests have been reported in connection with the site's shutdown, with RTÉ News reporting that a Dublin drug distribution center with ties to Silk Road had been raided. Two men in their 30s were arrested and almost €200,000 worth of cannabis, ecstasy and LSD were taken into custody.  DeepDotWeb reports  that the arrests are part of an ongoing global crackdown on dark markets labelled ""Onymous"", which promises to take down several dark market websites and forums over the next 24 hours.  Officers from the Garda National Drug Unit, the Computer Crime investigation Unit, and the Criminal Assets Bureau reported that the two men were major players in the distribution of illicit substances through black market websites, according to the report.  At press time, Silk Road 2.0's competing marketplace Agora was still online, though OpenBazaar had issued a foreboding tweet that could signal further action.

42377761,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73UvN,1415281317,Ghana Startup Launches Bitcoin Donations Hub to Aid Ebola Fight,"Unable to ignore the Ebola crisis in neighbouring Sierra Leone, Ghana-based remittances service Beam has launched a donations hub to raise funds for charities fighting the outbreak.  Launched on Monday, Bitcoin Against Ebola is a non-profit initiative that aims to reduce the percentage of charitable donations lost to fees in fiat currency money transfers.  The website will effectively act as a conduit for people in other parts of the world to send donations via bitcoin to two registered NGOs working in Sierra Leone: Sierra Leone Liberty Group and LunchBoxGift. It is also possible to remit money to family or friends affected by the crisis.  Beam  's CEO Nikunj Handa told CoinDesk:    ""We just couldn’t stand the fact that over 15% of the money [people] were sending to Sierra Leone to help their country was being spent on transaction fees.""    Minimising transaction fees  Sending money to the charity of your choice is a simple affair. After registering on the Bitcoin Against Ebola website and entering basic ID details, a payments page allows the user to select from Beam's supported charities or choose another by entering its name and Africell, Airtel or Comium telephone number.  Then it is merely matter of specifying the amount to send and scanning a QR code into your bitcoin wallet. Transactions are listed in your account immediately after sending and an email notification will be sent when the donation has arrived with the charity.    To get the funds to people on the ground, Beam has partnered with Splash Mobile Money, Sierra Leone’s largest mobile money provider. Nikunj said transaction fees cost just 2% – half going to Beam, half to Splash.  ""This is necessary to cover certain operational costs,"" Nikunj said. ""The recipients do not have to pay any extra money to cash out the money. 2% is the entire cost of getting cash to Sierra Leone ... Our exchange rate and lack of fixed fee is simply unbeatable.""  Donations can be as low as $1, and the charities receive the funds in minutes, according to the CEO, who stressed:    ""This is a non-profit initiative and we do not make any money out of this.""    Fighting the virus  While Ebola has not yet reached Ghana, the neighbouring countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea have suffered greatly from the deadly virus. Official estimates say almost 5,000 people have died, but the actual count is suspected to be much higher.  ""Entire villages have been wiped out by the disease,"" said Nikunj.  While the international effort to contain the outbreak and help those in afflicted regions is growing, the UN has said it still does not have the resources to contain the disease.  The charities supported by Beam are working on a much smaller scale than major organisations. However, Nikunj indicated that after interacting with NGOs in Sierra Leone, he found that small efforts in education and provision of supplies can also make a big difference.  He explained:    ""There is a lack of awareness on how the disease is spread. Some people even believe that the disease is 'fake' and this is a plot by the government against them. Due to this, there is a need for people on the ground in these countries educate the public on Ebola and how it can be prevented.""    One of Beam's featured charities, Sierra Leone Liberty Group, has been combatting this ignorance by promoting effective hygiene amongst local populations. Since the disease is highly contagious and easily transmitted through contact with body fluids like sweat and saliva, SLLG has also been discouraging people from shaking hands and sharing food.  Providing essential resources  Another issue for those fighting the disease or living in hard-hit areas is that food and medicines have to be delivered to patients and healthcare workers.  Making the issue even more complex, governments often quarantine affected homes and sometimes issue lockdowns of entire cities for days to prevent the spread of Ebola.  Under these restrictions, it is extremely difficult for people to gain access to food and other supplies, and NGOs play a critical role in providing essential resources before a lockdown begins.    Beam's second supported charity, LunchBoxGift provides freshly cooked lunches to these people, with each meal costing just £1 ($1.60).  LunchBoxGift is aiming to provide 50,000 hot meals to hospitalised patients and frontline healthcare workers in Ebola treatment centres over the next three months. This, the charity says, is particularly necessary because the isolation of patients means that their families cannot get food to them in the usual way.

The firm is promising speedy BTC-JPY transactions and has waived fees until the end of this year.  Coincheck  launched officially in September as a payment processor focusing on the e-commerce industry. Its arrival comes hot on the heels of international exchange Kraken, which launched its Japanese site just a week ago.  Speedy bank transfers  The new exchange promises easy sign-up and verification with Japanese ID if required, with minimum trades of ¥500 ($4.35). Bank transfers can be completed in as little as 10 minutes even for new customers, who can begin buying bitcoin straight away.  Customers may also link Japanese bank accounts for deposit and withdrawal. For deposits and withdrawals of less than ¥10,000 ($87.30) it is not necessary to supply identification.  The exchange features will integrate with Coincheck's other services, which, along with the payment processor, includes a consumer bitcoin wallet.  Consumer focus  With its simple interface and low minimum trades, Coincheck's exchange is not aimed at professional or high-frequency bitcoin traders. Instead, it is aimed at Japanese consumers who have heard about digital currency, but need an easy on-ramp to the bitcoin world.  Japan's various new consumer-focused bitcoin companies, including BitFlyer and Bitbank, are also trying to find a compelling local use case for digital currency.  The country already has various long-established NFC chip and card-based e-cash systems accepted nearly everywhere, such as Pasmo and Suica, and brick-and-mortar venues that accept bitcoin are limited to a handful of restaurants, bars and specialist businesses.  That handful is growing, though, with more bitcoin companies looking to recruit clients. Coincheck points to online men's cosmetics seller Bulkhomme, and Tokyo's Hackers Bar and Awabar – and says it aims to have over 500 businesses accepting bitcoin by next summer.  As in neighboring South Korea, there is potential in sales of digital goods, including casual games and add-ons for mobile chat apps, such as local favorite Line.  Coincheck is funded through Japanese social gaming giant DeNA's Incubate Fund for startups, with the fund reportedly looking into other bitcoin-related investments.
