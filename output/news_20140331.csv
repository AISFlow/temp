42377085,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkd1,1396299733,Mobile Payments Giant Square Introduces 'Pay with Bitcoin' Option on Square Market,"San Francisco-based mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) solution provider Square has announced that merchants will now be able to sell goods and services for bitcoin via its Square Market.  Introduced in June 2013, the Square Market is an online website that features Square retailers in a centralized location not unlike eBay or Etsy. Square Merchants are not charged for listing items on the marketplace, but pay 2.75% for each sale for payments made with traditional payment options.  Wrote the company on its official blog:  ""Making commerce easy means creating easy ways to exchange value for everything from a massage to a new calculator watch. In that spirit, starting today, buyers can purchase goods and services on Square Market with bitcoin.""  The news is especially significant as Square is expected to pass $1bn in total sales in 2014, and was most recently valued at $5bn.  Founded in 2009, Square has quickly become the dominant player in the burgeoning mPOS sector due to the popularity of its Square Credit Card Reader with small merchants. As of 2013, Square was processing an estimated $20bn in annual payment volume.  Despite Square's impressive performance, however, some commentators have alleged that Square merely offers a stopgap technology that will be eventually replaced by the prevailing mobile payment option of the future, making its interest in bitcoin potentially telling.  How it works  In a company blog post, Square Market lead Ajit Varma indicated that buyers who select the 'Pay with Bitcoin' option at checkout will:  Generate a new bitcoin address  Enter an email address to receive order details and receipt  Submit the bitcoin payment within 10 minutes, or the order will expire  Confirm payment to the network (buyers with a mobile wallet simply open and scan the QR code, while hosted wallet users will receive instructions for entering the information)  Have the payment validated by Square, which will detect that its receiving address was funded  Advance to the confirmation page.  During this time, Square will continually monitor the checkout process to ensure that it knows when the payment is received.  Said Varma about the process:  ""It’s pretty magical to witness first-hand!""  Merchants will receive the full amount of the purchase in dollars, minus Square's fee. Square didn't specify exactly what the fee is, but presumably it is the standard 2.75%.  The company also stressed it will not be offering an option to purchase bitcoin.  Should a customer require a refund, Square says it will refund in whatever currency was used for the purchase.  Industry impact  Given Square's leadership position in the mobile payments industry the new feature will likely be seen as yet another validation for bitcoin as an emerging payment mechanism.  Square follows fellow payments tech startup Stripe to become the latest payment facilitator to begin experimenting with bitcoin, and given the recent uptick in announcements, it's likely that these thought leaders in the space could encourage more to follow suit.  The California company also notably competes with Shopify in a number of verticals. Shopify added bitcoin as a payment option for its more than 70,000 merchants in November of last year.  Questions remain  Of course, as with any new announcement, Square provided only a big-picture version of how it will look to enable its merchants to accept bitcoin.  For example it is not yet known how Square will be managing the risk of providing zero-confirmation transactions.  CoinDesk has reached out to Square for further comment.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/31/mobile-payments-giant-square-introduces-pay-with-bitcoin-option-on-square-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62516a0df48f6b3f1d1d6b3177a7c2c212e328ed-1004x703.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377078,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkSx,1396295871,Online and Mobile Gamers Can Now Buy In-Game Perks with BTC Through SuperRewards,"San Francisco-based social and mobile game monetization specialist SuperRewards announced on 31st March that it will allow users to buy in-game virtual currencies from publishers such as A Thinking Ape, East Side Games Studio and Ninja Kiwi using bitcoin.      Bitcoin payments made by SuperRewards customers will be processed and converted to fiat currency by fellow San Francisco-based startup Coinbase. SuperRewards will then pay game publishers in US dollars.      Speaking to CoinDesk, SuperRewards co-founder Lyal Avery, indicated that adding bitcoin as a payment option lets his company take advantage of a natural overlap between its customer base and the digital currency's avid users.      Explained Avery:      ""We feel that it's a natural fit for someone that wants to buy virtual currency to use a digital currency.""              Unlike digital currencies, which can be exchanged for real-world money, virtual game currencies have value only within a specific game title or series of developer titles.      The most notable example would be popular social game Farmville's Farm Bucks, which can be purchased and traded for exclusive in-game items or special advantages.    Customer demand for bitcoin  Though SuperRewards supports a number of other payment options – from scratchable prepaid cards to pay by fax, Avery says that customer demand for bitcoin has been strong.    Said Avery:      ""We've had a bunch of emails in our support queue asking when we were going to accept bitcoin. It's something we want to be ahead of the curve on.""              This may not be surprising given the company's business model of facilitating alternative payments for global audiences. For example, Avery notes that he's been following bitcoin with interest for years.    Digital currencies in gaming  Bitcoin's potential to increase in-app payments for mobile games has been heralded as one of its most promising use cases, one encouraged by news that companies like social gaming giant Zynga and now SuperRewards are testing the waters.    However, while it may seem that digital currencies and virtual currencies are either extremely similar or competing options, Avery clarifies that they each have a specific role in online transactions. Digital currencies provide the potential to reduce publisher losses from fraud and chargebacks because they redefine the protocol of an online transaction. Virtual currencies allow those same publishers to construct digital economies and drive engagement among users.      Due to these benefits of digital currencies, Avery suggests that their expansion in the mobile and social game markets may come quickly:      ""What I do see as being really interesting is the intersection between the mid-core and hardcore gaming market and how fast they're adopting bitcoins.""              Avery notes that publishers have asked about receiving payment in bitcoin, though for the moment, this isn't something SuperRewards is prepared to offer due to legal complexities.    About SuperRewards  Founded in 2007, SuperRewards has partnerships with more than 2,500 publishers, and was purchased by game monetization company Playerize in 2012.    Further, it is not strictly a payments company. In addition to letting users pay directly for in-game currencies, SuperRewards also allows publishers to offer free virtual currencies to users who watch videos, sign up for a new service or take a survey through its offers program.      Playerize has raised a total of $2.5m from investors that include Real Ventures and Rho Ventures.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/31/online-and-mobile-gamers-can-now-buy-in-game-perks-with-btc-through-superrewards,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a772d19dc01be48c9ea075cc6497e3e21228ea2b-1000x700.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377081,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkXz,1396290371,PBOC Officials Discuss Bitcoin as China's Central Bank Stays Silent on Rumours,"Following as-yet-unconfirmed rumours that the People's Bank of China would move to block domestic banks from working with digital currency exchanges this April, the price of bitcoin has declined substantially since 26th March, dropping from a high of just over $580 to today's low of $442 on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index.  The decline  has been exacerbated by the fact the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank, has not yet issued a formal response. Notably, this lack of action sharply contrasts the events of 21st March, when the PBOC reacted quickly to quash rumours it would ban bitcoin.  As of press time on 31st March, no official word had yet been given as to whether the PBOC's stance toward bitcoin exchanges has altered.  However, two PBOC officials had independently addressed bitcoin, one via his personal microblogging site and the other at a speaking engagement at last Friday's 2014 China Internet Conference.  The officials offered seemingly contrasting takes on bitcoin and other digital currencies – with the former advising Chinese citizens to ""cherish life, walk away from bitcoin"", according to The Wall Street Journal, and the latter suggesting that bitcoin was a novel currency.  Though the statements may not reflect attitudes at the PBOC, they provide an insight into how the issue is perhaps being discussed at the major financial organisation.  Bitcoin exchanges compared to casinos  PBOC official Zhang Niannian took to his Sina Weibo account on Friday, 28th March, to compare bitcoin exchanges to casinos. Further, he called into question the legitimacy of the businesses, which he suggested could abscond with customer funds, leaving Chinese consumers with little recourse.  The Wall Street Journal reported that Zhang stated that his views do not represent those of the PBOC, but that he declined its requests for further comment.  According to the media outlet, it is unclear what Zhang's official position at the bank is, though he has been named as the PBOC's media contact on the subject of bitcoin in previous documents.  Bitcoin is a currency, not legal tender  The second notable statements allegedly come from Xu Nuojin, deputy head of the PBOC's Statistics and Analysis Department, who gave the keynote speech at the 2014 China Internet Conference on Friday, 28th March.  Informal translations of that speech indicate that Nuojin touched on the subject of bitcoin albeit briefly, calling bitcoin a currency, not a legal tender.  Further, he seemed to acknowledge the big picture implications of digital currencies, saying:  ""You can understand [bitcoin] as a kind of folk currency, so it is a currency, but it is not a legal tender. This is a breakthrough concept of sovereignty currency.""  Noujin went on to say that bitcoin is still not recognized by central banks as a currency, and that it lacked the recognition of an institution like the US Federal Reserve that would ensure its use.  Prices remain depressed  Though the comments highlight the conversations perhaps taking place between Chinese government officials, they are likely to do little to stem bitcoin's recent slide in value.  At press time, the price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk USD BPI was down 0.41%, or $1.90, for the day at $459.97.    Prices have been similarly low on the CoinDesk CNY BPI, which tracks price movements at major China-based exchanges BTC China and OKCoin.

42377077,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkUD,1396283819,"How Israel Can, and Should, Become Ground Zero for Bitcoin","Michael Eisenberg is a partner at early-stage venture capital fund Aleph. A key figure in Internet and software investment in Israel, he currently resides in Jerusalem and lectures on entrepreneurship at the Hebrew University.  Here, he makes a case for Israel as a potential hub for digital currency innovation.  This week, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) handed Israel a golden opportunity on a silver platter. Or, shall I say, a virtual gold opportunity. By deciding to tax bitcoin as an asset, like gold, the US Government effectively doomed bitcoin as a currency.  As Robinson Meyer correctly writes in The Atlantic:  “To tax bitcoin as property … destroys its fungibility: one bitcoin can no longer be exchanged for another …This was one of the original intents behind the service. Bitcoin aimed to function as a kind of digital money, meaning it had to work as a unit of account, a medium of exchange, and a store of value.”  To be clear, this does not doom bitcoin. The protocol and architecture of the block chain-based ledger will still enable endless disruption of existing industries.  However, it does cripple some of the nascent US-based entrepreneurial efforts to boost bitcoin-based commerce until the currency abstraction layer arrives on top of the bitcoin block chain. This Chamath Palihapitiya tweet is instructive in that regard:    ""Bitcoin is too complex for mass market. Need an abstraction so it can be used by people who don't care how it works"" @chamath #coinsummit      — Danny Thorpe (@danny_thorpe) March 26, 2014    Meyer, quoting Prof. Levitin of Georgetown, points out just how complex this tax treatment is for the common man:  “The price at which a particular bitcoin was acquired (and this is traceable) determines the capital gains on that particular bitcoin when spent. If I spend bitcoin A, which I bought at $10, but is now worth $400, I’ve got a very different tax treatment than if I spend bitcoin B, which I bought at $390. […] This means bitcoins are not fungible, and that makes it unworkable as a currency.”  I believe this opens the door for another jurisdiction, with appropriate regulatory and tax regulations, the right technology ecosystem and interested entrepreneurs to become the epicentre of bitcoin and virtual currency innovation. Israel should become exactly that place.  Israel is currently working on its bitcoin regulatory framework. The Bank of Israel and Israeli Tax Authorities should treat bitcoin as a currency and apply sure but light regulation. They should not, as Professor Danny Tziddon suggested at our Aleph Bitcoin event, simply follow the US Federal Reserve or government.  The Israeli regulators should “zag” where the US “zigged”. They should take a simple approach and not the United States’ complex approach. This would increase the velocity of bitcoin purchased by Israelis by making it a medium of exchange.  That increased velocity, and hence use, would also speed up the innovation around bitcoin, its protocol and the general commercial applications of virtual currency in Israel. Critically, it will also attract global bitcoin entrepreneurs to Israel.  Critical mass  Israel already has a critical mass of the crypto expertise and the entrepreneurial verve to enable bitcoin innovation to flourish here. We also have another advantage: we are a small country, a community, with our own currency that is not the world’s reserve currency.  Our economic system is not threatened by the emergence of a digital and decentralized currency. Our community ethos breeds trust, which is so necessary for new currencies. Hence, Israel can uniquely enable virtual currency and innovation to flourish around this digital currency revolution.  We are one of the few countries that stands to gain more as a country from the export of innovation engendered by bitcoin and virtual currencies than we stand to lose by having an alternative currency to fiat currency. Thus, we should be encouraging our legislators and regulators in Israel to be avant-garde, daring and world-leading in their policy approach toward bitcoin and virtual currencies.

42377083,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkaV,1396278111,'Micky' Malka on How Bitcoin Can Help the World's Unbanked,"Meyer 'Micky' Malka – a director at the Bitcoin Foundation – has been a financial industry entrepreneur since the age of 18, first in his native Venezuela and later in Europe and the US, where he most recently founded mobile payments company Lemon Inc., now part of LifeLock.  Also founder of Ribbit Capital, Malka says he wants to use the firm ""as an agent for change in the ossified and slow-to-change financial services category."" Besides investing in five companies in the space, Ribbit is investing directly in bitcoin – reportedly, along with Social+Capital Partnership, controlling 5% of the bitcoins currently in existence.  Malka sat down with CoinDesk at CoinSummit San Francisco to talk about why his firm is leading the charge to invest in the bitcoin space, how bitcoin can help people all over the world, and what needs to happen before bitcoin is ready for prime time.  CoinDesk: How has your experience with hyperinflation and bank failures in Venezuela influenced your interest in bitcoin?  Malka: In Venezuela for the last 12 years, it's been prohibitive to buy dollars, and it's an economy where everything works in dollars. It's become a giant black market. There's an official exchange rate if you are importing medicine and basic goods, another exchange rate if you are a tourist, there's another exchange rate if you are a businessman. There is another exchange rate if you want to buy dollars. It's crazy.  There is no price if you want to hold assets outside of your country – in theory you can't. It's crazy that in 2014 we still have places like that.  What bitcoin can do and has been doing is: one, embracing transparency in a country where there isn't any. It's an asset for when you do not trust your government, which is a real aspect of what's going on down there right now. And, two, allowing the economy to have to escape valves – ways to let this pressure out of the market.  Are there bitcoin startups in Venezuela filling this need?  No. There are no formal companies. It's more informal entrepreneurs trying to start. Right now Venezuela is in crisis mode. It's very hard to find people who are wiling to back entrepreneurs and fund companies when you're in the middle of this. However, LocalBitcoins and Bitcoin Venezuela, gatherings, meetups and exchanges are coming up informally all over the country.  How does the interest in Venezuela compare to in the US?  It's different because [here in the US] people think of bitcoins as speculation. Over there they think of it as a way to store value. There's a big difference of mentality ... what you can do with this.  When you don't trust your government and you don't trust their currency, the whole concept of having some sort of asset that is decentralized, that no one controls, that is scarce or limited, it's very refreshing.  People like cars as an asset. My first car – my parents gave it to me – cost $6,000. I sold it for $11,000. That mentality is very different from what we have here.  So because bitcoin is so potentially useful to Venezuelans, does a larger portion of the population there know what it is?  No, not yet. Mainly because the country is going through so much crisis that no one is paying attention to it. But you're starting to see more and more momentum.  You have warned that because bitcoin is in its infancy, no one should invest in it more than they can afford to lose. Yet, you have also spoken very confidently about the future of bitcoin, and Ribbit has purchased a large amount of bitcoin. Are you less cautious than you advise other people to be?  I am that cautious. I think this is an experiment in society. This is not a currency experiment. Can society trust an electronic ledger more than they can trust other aspects of life? Can they trust a ledger the same way they can trust gold or the governments printing money? That's a big experiment. It doesn't happen overnight. It took gold thousands of years to become what it is. It took governments three, four hundred years to become who they are.  You cannot expect bitcoin at five years old to take all that responsibility and act like a grown-up. It is still a toddler. That is a reality of this. Only as you see more people embracing it is it growing up. We're not there yet. We're super early. This is something you do from a venture capital perspective, something you do with what you're willing to lose. This is not where you put your savings. That's the difference.  I have a mandate. I'm getting paid by my investors to find asymmetric risks. That's what a venture investor does. I cannot find anything more compelling than bitcoin to deliver that. But I also have to be able to go back to my investors and say, ""Sorry, it didn't work."" There's nothing other than bitcoin that has that asymmetrical return right now in financial services. And also at the same time, it's something that can really change society for the good.  At peak in the world there were a billion landlines. Now we have six billion mobile lines. It's no coincidence that there are a billion bank accounts, but there are seven billion people. What are the chances of the banks banking the other six billion people, and what are the chances of something like bitcoin helping solve financial problems for that six billion? It's just too big of an opportunity. That's why I find nothing more interesting than this right now.  Are you disclosing how many bitcoins Ribbit is holding now?  No. It's a very large position.  Will Ribbit buy more bitcoins?  No, because our mandate is to find the companies. When we bought our bitcoin position, it was in a time when there were no entrepreneurs or companies that were worth backing. Right now we're seeing a great number of entrepreneurs and business ideas, and more interest from the ecosystem, so we'd rather back those.  Can you walk us through Ribbit's investments in the digital currency space – what companies, how much is invested in each, and why you chose them?  We've announced four out of the five that we're funding. Coinbase, Xapo, BTCjam and Pantera. Coinbase because it's the most trusted brand in the US for consumers to buy into bitcoins. Xapo is the ultimate and the best storage solution for bitcoins in the world right now – it gives you protection and insurance. BTCjam is building the first worldwide lending network on top of bitcoin. Pantera is the largest bitcoin currency fund in the world and is structured as a hedge fund.  In aggregate, we are probably the venture investor with the most exposure in the world to bitcoins, between those investments and the coins, of course.  What are your further plans for investing in the space through Ribbit? What are the big unmet needs that you would like to see new companies filling?  Right now we need a combination of two things:  More companies that are helping customers embrace bitcoin. We need more customers in this ecosystem. We need to add zeros. Whatever is building trust in the consumer, and making them understand what bitcoin can do for them, that's what we're interested in investing in. Ribbit is a fund that only invests in consumer financial services. We only invest in companies that are disrupting the consumer experience with financial products. That's our mandate, the only thing we look at. We're very consumer-centric.  Once that happens – and it hasn't happened yet – the second thing is using bitcoins as a protocol, not so much as a service but as a protocol. That's something that hasn't been done yet in things that will matter to consumers. One company that we are backing super early is creating a lending network around the world. They're using bitcoin not as a currency, not as an asset, but as a protocol to allow people to invest and borrow from other people all over the world. That's a user case. Somebody in India is saying I need to borrow money, and someone in Germany is willing to lend them money. You put them together.  You were recently elected to the board of the Bitcoin Foundation. Why did you want to be involved with the organization, and do you have goals for your tenure?  I've been a serial entrepreneur in this space for 20 years. I built four companies. I've been regulated by eight central banks. I lived in Europe, I lived in Latin America, I now live in the US. I thought that if I really believe in bitcoin, I had to also contribute back to it. Being part of the foundation with that kind of background was a good way of getting involved in trying to shape how regulators think of bitcoin and how to expand the foundation to something global, not something US-centric.  You have said that Mt. Gox's failure was more a case of one bad apple than a sign of a troubled system. Can you explain why you see it that way?  There were too many signals for too long that they were really inefficiently running their business. This is a company that a year ago had troubles with the law in the US; the government froze their money. They started to impede deposits and withdrawals eight months ago. It was like a slow death. It was not like overnight something blew up and trust got destroyed. This was a slow motion movie of a company going under for awhile. It shows that this is a problem of early entrepreneurs not being backed by the right investors, not having checks and balances, not working with regulators, not being transparent to their customer base. They were never transparent. They never communicated what was going on.  When you look at Coinbase's weekly blogs or Bitstamp's communications or Bitpay's investors or Xapos' insurance policies, it's a whole different system. There are much better entrepreneurs and companies out there.  What are the biggest problems that need to be worked out with bitcoin before it can reach its potential?  Number one, we need more entrepreneurs willing to work with regulators. You cannot only depend on the foundation to solve your regulatory issues.  Two, you want to see more simple user cases that are daily life, not corner cases. We need to see more simple usages of bitcoin solving real daily problems. The ecosystem is not behaving like that, still. You need more financial institutions willing to embrace bitcoins. They don't know if bitcoin is a friend or a foe.  With those things in place, venture capital will keep coming in, and then you create this ecosystem.  A lot of the talk about bitcoin is about who might get rich from it. Given your background in banking and low-cost financial services, can you talk about bitcoin's promise for low-income people internationally?  This is the way I think about it: six billion people have the same device I have [Malka holds up his phone]. Can they buy a $1 app the same way you and I can? They can't, for a few reasons. Sometimes they make $1 salaries, so they cannot afford a $1 app. Second, they don't have a bank account to buy a $1 app. They have the same device, but they can't use it the same way. Would they buy that app if it cost 1 cent? Probably yes. Can somebody charge 1 cent? Probably not, because Visa and MasterCard and bank transactions are more expensive than that. Can bitcoin solve that issue? Definitely. Microtransations for the six billion people. So there's a clear user case right there, which is simply letting anybody in the world buy the same apps you and I buy, which is not happening right now.  The other one is, people want to store value in something other than gold or dollars, or something other than local currency. This has a chance of being one of those solutions.

42377089,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xki3,1396273096,$46k Spent on Mining Hardware: Who Will Deliver the Goods?,"Manufacturers of digital currency mining equipment have become notorious for their long delays in shipments and poor customer service. But is this general perception actually the case?  Dario Di Pardo gives us his insight into the world of the frustrated miner, after personally dealing with a number of mining hardware makers over the last five months, and dealing with widely varying levels of delay, customer services and offers of compensation or refund.  Black Arrow  Product: Prospero X-3 (2 TH/s)  Price including shipping: $4,978  Order date: November 18th, 2013  Anticipated shipping date: February 24th, 2014  Expected delay: 2-3 months  After ordering in November and expecting delivery in February, shipping has now been delayed till May 1st due to power consumption issues with Black Arrow's 28nm ASIC chip.  To compensate for the delay, however, the company offered free cloud hashing power for six months – effectively worth 25% of the purchased hashing power.  Tape-out of the improved chip was completed on February 23rd, and no further issues that could endanger the new shipping date are foreseen.  Customer support has been somewhat slow, but still reasonable.  HashFast  Product: Sierra (1.2 TH/s)  Price including shipping: $6,696  Order date: November 18th, 2013  'Guaranteed' delivery date: February 15th, 2014  Expected delay: 2.5 months  In December, a production update was communicated via email. Unfortunately, it also contained the email addresses of all HashFast customers, thus compromising their privacy, as well as mine.  My initial order confirmation gave February 15th as the 'guaranteed delivery date' (deliveries after this date entitle buyers to a refund). In January, however, I received an email giving March 31st as the new 'guaranteed delivery date'. The email came without any complementary information whatsoever.  I received a further email on 28th March concerning shipping updates. Basically in my case (Batch 3), I must accept another month of delay (May shipment) or I can 'upgrade' my order to the new Sierra EVO (2 TH/s).  The latter option would also mean later shipment (end of May) and because it will be a kit, I would have to buy my own power supplies.  Ironically enough, people who placed an order for the Sierra EVO (available as of 20th February) will seemingly get theirs before I do, in April, this is despite the fact that I ordered mine three months before them.  Bitcoin refund requests from early customers who paid their order in bitcoins were refused and offered refunds in fiat at USD hardware pricing at the time of purchase instead. According some displeased customers, who are now considering legal action against HashFast, the terms of service clearly stated that orders paid in bitcoins would be refunded with the same amount of bitcoins.  Facing a one-week backlog, their customer support strikes me as questionable: some emails are ignored, while others are answered with generic replies.  No compensation for the delivery delay has been offered at this time.  Virtual Mining Corporation (VMC)  Product: Fast-Hash One Platinum Edition (1 TH/s)  Price including shipping: $6,479  Order date: November 24th, 2013  Anticipated shipping date: January 2014  Delay: 8 months?  Production of VMC's consumer mining machines is subject to a significant delay, due to underperformance of the 28nm ASIC chip manufactured by eASIC.  According Kenneth E. Slaughter, CEO of VMC, which is a subsidiary of Active Mining Corporation, customers who wish to cancel their pre-order will be refunded in full.  Strangely enough, this delay is not being communicated to the company's customers, neither by email nor via the website. One can only discover this information by checking the forums.  Considering the delay and lack of communication, I decided to apply for a refund on January 10th.  The only refund method is by cheque, and I received mine about a month after my application. Unfortunately the cheque came with a misspelling in my name, so that cashing it in was impossible.  The cheque was sent back with an accompanying letter clearly stating the correct spelling of the recipient's name, just to be sure.  However, mid-March a new cheque arrived containing the same misspelling and, this time, it wasn't signed either. At this point I started to wonder whether these errors were being done on purpose to delay the refund.  Declining my request to have the funds wired to my bank account instead, VMC will now be sending a third cheque (after receiving the unsigned one back from me).  So, maybe with some luck, some four to five months after applying for a refund, I will actually get my money back.  Despite all this, their customer service team has pretty good response times to email inquiries.  Bitmine  Product: CoinCraft Desk (1 TH/s)  Price including shipping: $5,758  Order date: November 28th, 2013  Anticipated shipping date: February (week 1)  Expected delay: 2.5 to 3 months  After a three months' delay, Bitmine began shipping their first CoinCraft Desk units on the 12th of February.  According to CEO Giorgio Massarotto, exactly one month thereafter, about 250 units were delivered, which would average out at a production capacity of 12 units a day.  Some customers have claimed the slow production rate is due to a deal Bitmine made with PETA-MINE, allowing them to cut in front of the delivery queue, causing extra delay for ordinary customers. This has not been confirmed, however.  In addition, Bitmine is currently experiencing a shortage of 1300W power supplies, which are needed for a fully populated (1 TH/s) CoinCraft Desk. Also a result of the PETA-MINE deal, according to some commenters.  Early recipients of the hardware have also reported that the Desk's 'turbo mode' doesn't work as advertised. For a 1 TH/s Desk 'turbo mode' would allow hash rates up to 1.5 TH/s. In reality it doesn't even come close to that number, they said.  Those who have ordered a CoinCraft Rig unit will have to cope with yet more delay, in the sense that shipment of these units has yet to be started. A recently published news update on the company website says this is expected in early April.  To compensate for the delay, Bitmine has a customer protection plan in place, which the company says consists of the following:    1) Shipment can be late up to a maximum of 10 days from the agreed shipment date.      2) For each subsequent 10 days of late shipping, we will add for free 10% more hashing power to your order as penalty.    3) After the 61st day of late shipment, you have the right to request a full refund and we will pay you an additional penalty of 10% of the initial order amount.    However, Bitmine recently announced on its official forum (just before it was closed down for about a week due to personal insults towards the CEO) that the maximum bonus hashing power was limited to 50% – a fact not mentioned in their customer protection plan.  This fact, in addition to the PETA-MINE story and the CoinCraft Desk's 'turbo mode' issues, has led to many upset customers.  From the end of February till mid-March emails were answered with a delay of one to two weeks. During this period it was also very difficult to get a support representative on the phone.  Bitmine has worked through its support tickets backlog, however, and you can now expect a response time of about one day.  So far, Bitmine has been unable to provide an estimated shipment date for my order.  KnCMiner  Product: Neptune (3 TH/s)  Price including shipping: $10,175  Pre-order date: January 7th, 2014  Anticipated shipping date: Q2 2014  Expected delay: None  Having taped out their 20nm ASIC chip in February, KnCMiner seems on track for the Q2 delivery of the 3 TH/s SHA-256 mining rig.  In case a delay should occur, KnCMiner has said it will compensate customers with a free hosted hashing package as part of its so-called 'Plan B'.  Alpha Technology  Product: Viper (Scrypt) Miner (90 MH/s)  Price excluding shipping: £5,450 ($8,984)  Pre-order date: January 10th, 2014  Anticipated shipping date: July 2014  Expected delay: None  Shortly after the KnCMiner 100 MH/s scrypt miner announcement on March 3rd, Alpha Technology struck back with updated specifications for both of its upcoming miners.  The hash rate of the 5 MH/s scrypt miner has increased to 16 MH/s, while the 25 MH/s rig will be mining at 90 MH/s. Prices have not increased as a result.  Regular development updates contribute to a good customer experience so far.  CoinTerra  Product: TerraMiner IV (2 TH/s)  Price including shipping: $6,569  Order date: January 12th, 2014  Anticipated shipping date: May 2014  Expected delay: None  CoinTerra's January and February batches were shipped out with a delay of about a month.  Because hardware specifications have been lower than anticipated – with a hash rate up to 1.72 TH/s instead of the advertised 2 TH/s and a 20% power draw increase – early customers were offered a 15% discount coupon redeemable against their next CoinTerra hardware purchase.  Seemingly now on track for delivery of later batches, they are working on improving the miner's performance and power efficiency to meet its initial specifications.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Dario Di Pardo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/31/46k-spent-on-mining-hardware-who-will-deliver-the-goods,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/78402c3a178b0ec41004fcbfa357f2fa694bbbbd-1000x664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374515,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlCYr,1396268899,IRS Bitcoin Ruling May Have a Bright Side,"Last week's guidance from the IRS on tax treatment for bitcoin transactions may have temporarily impeded one avenue in a single jurisdiction, but it has opened up another more significant avenue.  An IRS ""property"" classification for bitcoin reaffirms its status as ""digital gold"" because it tacitly encourages one type of monetary activity (store of value) over another (medium of exchange).  If bitcoin is digital gold, then gold is analog bitcoin. Both commodities have a significant economic role to play going forward because one is a consensual store of value based on chemical properties and the other is a consensual store of value based on mathematical properties.  This ruling was a lose-lose scenario for the IRS because an alternative tax ruling for treating bitcoin as a currency would have placed it in direct transactional competition with the US dollar. The Department of the Treasury was loath to do that at least from a tax perspective.  The big picture  In the big picture of so-called monetary transactions, economies support three basic types of transactions: person-to-business (P2B), business-to-business (B2B), and person-to-person (P2P). One could also include business-to-person (B2P), but I tend to leave that in the category of P2B.  These classifications hold up whether transactions are physical or digital and also whether transactions are domestic or international.  Regarding tax treatment in various jurisdictions, the only transaction classes affected would be P2B and some B2B in the jurisdictions enforcing merchant compliance for customer identity reporting. Hence, merchant compliance becomes a point of enforcement for authorities.  This is important because any tax rulings that bestow preferential treatment on bitcoin as a commodity will tend to nudge bitcoin (XBT) in the direction of a store of value perhaps backing alternate types of currency issuance or handling predominately large cross-border transactions – exactly the role played by gold (XAU) today.  Since gold and bitcoin are both monetary commodities that don't represent another party's liabilities, they become a medium of last resort for transactions without counterparty risk.  The two most prominent monetary metals in the world are gold and silver and while they might have established themselves initially in physical hand-to-hand exchanges, their usage has evolved beyond that. Even prior to the Internet, practical monetary transactions demanded easy divisibility and reasonable carry costs.  Dual properties  Bitcoin has the advantage of being both a potential long-term store of value and a useful medium in ordinary day-to-day transaction settings. The fact that bitcoin accommodates both makes its ultimate outcome more a function of jurisdictional treatment than commodity properties.  Remember, two of bitcoin's medium-of-exchange advantages over gold are its near-infinite sub-divisibility and its near-zero transportation cost over long distances.  Cypherpunk hacker juno moneta tweeted:  — juno moneta (@firstecache) March 29, 2014  What does this statement mean? Who wants to transform bitcoin?  To understand the answer to that, one must understand how PayPal willingly transformed itself in the regulatory sphere to get mainstream adoption. If the bitcoin innovators end up with a PayPal-like system saddled with third-party choke points, what has really changed in the payments world? Our twitter commentator states that the current IRS ruling happily steers bitcoin in the opposite direction.  Whereas PayPal never had the capability to evolve in the opposite direction, the distributed bitcoin network and its corresponding unit of value bitcoin certainly does. This is where the really big boys play.  The IRS ruling is also likely to elevate digital gold bitcoin into some form of reserve currency status and the vehicle of choice for large cross-border transactions. It would not be unusual to see this emergence as different jurisdictions will undoubtedly have varying treatments for ""official"" bitcoin classification.  Additionally, this outcome would support the thesis that larger international exchanges operate like bitcoin clearing houses while the domestic or regional exchanges satisfy the local markets.  About reserve currency  Reserve currency status refers to the use of a favored monetary instrument or commodity that is commonly held by nation-states and institutions for foreign exchange reserves and large cross-border transactions.  Reserve currencies, like gold, can also be used for the ultimate backing of a government's own monetary regimes as in the currency substitution cases of Panama, Barbados, Bermuda, and Uruguay.  Bitcoin as a reserve currency asset has appeal because it is non-governmental and global in nature. Its sustainability will not be affected by regional political instability and it has the potential to outlast certain countries and their form of government. Bitcoin is governed by the laws of mathematics.  In the case of large cross-border transactions, bitcoin has appeal because it knows no political boundaries nor is it hampered by capital controls, orchestrated payment blockades, and foreign exchange restrictions. As these transactions are typically performed by sovereigns or large institutions, the jurisdictional tax treatment will probably not be a concern. Possible use cases include closed-loop diamond brokers settling intra-network trades or even partner countries within a trading bloc seeking a pricing and settlement unit other than USD.  Institutional and sovereign transactions fall under the B2B payments category and they also could provide the valuable underpinning for bitcoin price discovery absent sufficient retail price discovery. Just as end-to-end encrypted email messaging, on-network P2P bitcoin transactions exist in a world of their own.

42377074,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkQR,1396265725,UK Bitcoin Exchange Bit121 Temporarily Ceases Operations,"UK-based bitcoin exchange Bit121 has announced that it will suspend trading and temporarily close today, March 31st. Although the exchange has indicated that the closure is not permanent, it has not said when it will reopen.  Bit121  said most of the site's functionality was removed on March 26th. However, users have been able to view account balances and statements, withdraw any sterling balance greater than £50 with no fee, and withdraw any bitcoins held with the exchange. All orders have been cancelled.  On Thursday (27th March), the exchange started carrying out withdrawal transactions on every account with a positive GBP balance.  Merely 'hibernating'  Bit121 had urged all users to withdraw their bitcoins prior to today's closure. The exchange maintained that it has been making every effort to contact all account holders individually to offer any help and support required.  Said the exchange:  ""Despite regretfully closing our doors for now, we like to think we have simply gone into hibernation, and we fully intend to re-open at some point in the near future. We have learned a great deal and gained a lot of experience in our 4-5 months of running a bitcoin exchange. It has been a challenging few months without a doubt but also a lot of fun. We would like to thank all our customers for your business, your support, your feedback and your understanding.""  Bit121 added that it is closing down in an orderly fashion and that it has already refunded sterling balances. Returning all customers' bitcoins, however, will take a little longer, as some customers do not hold personal wallets.  Payment issues  When it launched, Bit121 teamed up with payment service provider PacNet Services Ltd, which in turn worked with Barclays PLC. However, since then, the relationship with PacNet Services has broken down.  The exchange told CoinDesk that it decided to close because it was simply taking too long to secure an alternative banking partner.  Bit121 told CoinDesk:    ""Rather than have the website sitting dormant with minimal activity, it made sense to temporarily close Bit121 until a suitable banking partner has been secured. The likelihood is that there will need to be some redesign of back-end processes anyway once we re-launch, so the closure will provide us with some time and space to make some necessary changes to our processes and potentially some improvements to both the back-end processes and the bit121 website.      ""Our top priority is our customers and the service that we provide to them. We will only re-launch, when we are certain that we can provide a high-quality and competitive service to our customers.""    About Bit121  Never a large exchange, Bit121 launched last November and a month later chief executive Jim Iddiols said daily trading volume was about £100,000, with more than 500 registered users.  The exchange suffered a few teething problems shortly after it was launched, forcing it to suspend trading in on 28th November. Shortly thereafter, Bit121 resumed services after it found that there was, in fact, no glitch at all.  The exchange stored most of its holdings in cold storage and it maintained only a very small number of bitcoins in its hot wallet. No security issues were reported and, for better or worse, Bit121 didn't make that many headlines – usually a good thing when it comes to bitcoin exchanges.  For Brits despairing at the lack of exchange options, there is good news, however, as the departure of Bit121 coincides with the launch of Coinfloor, a new outfit that seems intent on becoming Britain's premier bitcoin exchange.

42425574,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIZF3h,1396261988,Why Bitcoin Faces an Uphill Battle in the Remittance Market,"One of the most routinely cited use cases for bitcoin is in the international remittance market – the financial sector worth over $500bn a year that specializes in facilitating transactions across borders at a markup that reduces the total money sent by 9% on average.  Given the high cost the remittance services, it's no surprise that many in the bitcoin industry take its potential in the space for granted. After all, its underlying technology offers anyone the ability to conduct low-cost, peer-to-peer payments without restriction.  Due to the power of the technology, it can sound like the traditional remittance market is already dead in the water. However, what's not often considered is that the technology might not be allowed to reach its full potential.  According to Andrew Brown, head of compliance at cross-border payments specialist Earthport, the current high fees in the traditional remittance market aren't just imposed by greedy service providers.  Brown believes much of these charges come from the added costs of compliance and regulation, costs that won't just disappear when bitcoin businesses enter the market. His prediction in light of this estimation is grim:  ""By the time all those obligations have been applied, I don't think any apparent advantage [for bitcoin] will be left.""  Although Brown doesn't specialize in digital currency, testimonials from bitcoin entrepreneurs in the field suggest similar difficulties, if less dire, conclusions.  Tomas Alvarez, CEO of bitcoin remittance startup Coincove, for example, was forced back to the drawing board on his bitcoin remittance plans after being regulated out of the US market.  Explains Alvarez:  ""We were banking on bitcoin being unregulated, allowing us to build, test and validate before regulations were enacted in our target countries. Unfortunately, the US beat us by a few months and effectively declared bitcoin as money, making it prohibitive for a startup to get licenses.""  As Alvarez's story shows, bitcoin businesses are potentially facing a long, uphill battle on the remittance front.  The high cost of failure  Perhaps most notable of Brown's concerns was that current regulation poses a formidable barrier even to new traditional remittance businesses. For example, Brown notes that the banking networks that service remittance providers are increasingly deciding not to serve aspiring entrants.  Brown cautioned that bitcoin can't be seen as the ""weak leak"" when it comes to money laundering, a criticism that has been prevalent of bitcoin among law enforcement officials:  ""There is so much invested by governments, international bodies and law enforcement agencies in the regulatory framework around trying to prevent organized crime [...] No government is going to suddenly leave open a back door to let some murky waters in.""  Brown also discussed how banks are pulling back from servicing accounts for cash remittances due to heavy fines, in particular he noted that the UK to Somalia service has badly impacted the Somalian communities.  The catch-22 inherent in the current system was perhaps summed up by Forbes, when it wrote:  ""Essentially, we can have a banking system with the current rules and regulations about money laundering or we can have a banking system that can handle remittances into Somalia. But what we cannot have is both: for the regulations are too expensive to allow the sending of small remittances into Somalia.""  Mexico, one of the markets in which Coincove is working, for example, has very strict AML guidelines due to the local drug trade, and high penalties for non-compliance. But, Alvarez said that he believes Coincove can adapt around this challenge, saying:  ""We believe that as long as we start developing our own AML and KYC framework from this early stage, we will be well-prepared if and when the Mexican government decides to regulate bitcoin.""  Coincove is not considered a money business in Mexico, but it is following the guidelines as a preemptive measure, Alvarez says. Due to these steps, he says his group is now working with domestic payment processors and banks.  Juan Llanos  , a risk and compliance expert who serves on the Bitcoin Foundation's regulatory affairs committee, however, notes that compliance is different from the risk of money laundering.  He told CoinDesk: ""You can be non-compliant and still have low money-laundering risk because of the nature and size of your business.""  Regulatory uncertainty  The foremost reason Brown suggests bitcoin remittance businesses will struggle is because of the different ways digital currencies are being approached by regulators. He noted that in China its use is severely restricted, while in Norway it's treated as an asset.  Due to these differences, Brown says, regulators will not provide bitcoin remittance businesses with the free reign they may need to innovate.  Alvarez echoed this danger. Coincove is now operating in Latin America, due in part to its slow response on digital currency regulation, providing it exactly this testing ground.  ""Given the uncertainties around the state of bitcoin in most countries at this point, it’s probably wise to start off with jurisdictions that you are familiar with.""  However, as an early market entrant, he sees an opportunity to influence regulation through eventual dialogue in these countries.  Brown acknowledged that companies that facilitate remittances between certain lucrative markets may be the most likely to take hold, provided the legislative framework is complementary, and so far Coincove provides evidence to this claim.  However, as Alvarez indicates, it still finds itself locked out of the US, the largest sender of remittances, so such arrangements are inherently limiting to the expansion of his business.  Bank 'discrimination'  Llanos was more optimistic than Brown, noting that technology always outpaces regulation and that, although there will be challenges ahead, bitcoin can find a way to overcome them.  Still, he mentioned similar challenges to those cited up by Brown, indicating that both Western Union and a new bitcoin remittance startup with no customers and no volume, would still be expected to meet the same licensing and anti-money laundering requirements.  Said Llanos:  ""Granted, each is supposed to be treated differently by virtue of the basic and highly-touted 'risk-based approach' principle, but that doesn’t necessarily happen. The reality is that regulators and bankers more often than not expect 100% compliance without regard to the likelihood and impact of the risks, the size of the businesses or the reach of a product.""  With the right know-how and resources, he says, licensing can be achieved, but the inability to obtain banking services is yet another hurdle. However, Llanos suggested that the entire financial industry – from remittance to prepaid card providers, is facing these challenges:  ""There are very few, too few, banks who are willing to consider opening an account [in these cases]. The regulatory pressures they themselves are under and the business case do not always justify taking the risk of banking this class of business. It’s really incredible, but an entire industry class is being discriminated against, just by virtue of the nature of the business.""  Furthermore, even once banks get on board, liquidity is another obstacle – due in part to the nature of the markets in which remittance businesses operate. Llanos explained:  ""Because buyers of digital currency are so few in the biggest payout jurisdictions – Mexico, India, the Philippines, Africa – this is bound to continue to be a big roadblock for some time.""  What lies ahead  Of course, given that bitcoin can be transmitted freely by users without boundaries, it remains unclear exactly what function bitcoin remittance businesses would provide consumers.  Alvarez, however, disagrees with this notion. He believes bitcoin remittance companies will be essential, especially in the early stages, as there is very little overlap between his target market and current bitcoin users.  ""From the insights that we gathered about remittance senders and receivers, we can foresee that bitcoin may not be a technology that they’d directly want to interact with for many years to come – many of them don’t even feel comfortable with traditional banking systems or credit/debit card services.""  Alvarez concluded:  ""In this sense, I believe that the main value added by remittance businesses would be empathy: developing a product with a deep understanding of the unique needs and desires of the specific market that is remittance senders.""  As for when Alvarez may be able to reach such a goal in a cost-effective manner, Llanos says that is a matter bitcoin's proponents will ultimately decide.  ""The industry needs to band together, speak up and invest in formal and informal efforts to influence policymakers, legislators and regulators to really pay attention to the issues and effect the necessary changes. [...] The Bitcoin Foundation also has committees working on these issues and many other groups are forming worldwide with the same goals.""  Even though he supports this burgeoning industry, Llanos questions whether more traditional remittance businesses based on bitcoin will be necessary given the technology's ability:  ""I see the evolution of remittances from the regulated intermediaries of today to truly peer-to-peer remittances happening very soon.""

UK-based LMB Holdings is the parent company of Neo & Bee, a bitcoin company that offers bank-like services, and which recently opened its first premises in Cyprus.  An update today on the company's Havelock page said:    ""Havelock Investments has been formally informed by the Pass-Through Fund Manager of NEOBEE that the compliance officer of Neo and Bee Ltd has stated that due to an increase of abnormal activity on the LMB share platform, there may be a high possibility of questionable trading activity. While Neo and Bee Ltd investigate the issue further they have strongly recommended that we halt trading and transfers.""      Havelock Investments has halted the NEOBEE fund and is awaiting further instructions from the issuer.""    A jittery bitcoin world, traumatized by years of sudden and high-profile downfalls in the space, immediately leapt on the news that one of its newest flag carriers might be in trouble. It should be stressed that the news at this stage only refers to the temporary share trading suspension, and that Neo & Bee's regular business continues to operate as usual.  There has been no public statement from Neo & Bee itself, and Havelock Investments has not elaborated on what the ""questionable trading activity"" might have entailed.  While CEO Danny Brewster is out of the country and has not made an official statement on the events, he denied anything untoward about his actions.  ""My silence is for a very valid and personal reason, all the rumors that are flying about are false and couldn't be further from the truth. I haven't moved from Cyprus or anything of the kind. I am TEMPORARILY out of the country resolving some big issues that were made much worse by people stating incorrect facts in a public forum.""  Strange trades  Whether it was related to Neo & Bee's request to Havelock or not is uncertain, but this unusual thread appeared on the bitcointalk forums on 22nd March, with a relatively new user expressing an urgent need to sell over 28,000 (despite originally saying 1,000) LMB shares, outside Havelock's platform.  ""I need the money ASAP, and the website says 'Transfers are typically completed in 1-2 business days.' which I would rather not wait,"" the user wrote.  Share prices  Neo & Bee, consisting of brick-and-mortar bitcoin savings company Neo and card-based payment processor Bee, exists under UK umbrella company LMB Holdings. LMB also controls cash-to-bitcoin processor Neo Easycoin and has plans for a future Neo Xchange brokerage platform. The first Neo physical bitcoin savings branch opened in Cyprus just last month.  The company launched an IPO on bitcoin-only share trading platform Havelock Investments in September 2013. The price stayed fairly constant at 0.0029 BTC preceding the first Neo branch opening, before jumping to its highest point of 0.00594 BTC on 26th February. It currently sits around 0.00185 BTC.  A revised version of LMB Holdings' prospectus, by Brewster, was released on 17th March with details of all current operations and future plans, including Crypto Portfolio Management, the 'Homemall' merchant marketplace and a remittance service.  Brewster had promised a PDF version of the prospectus with appendices containing all financial projections later that week, but neither has been released as yet. He has also been absent from Twitter since 18th March.  New bitcoin world  Many in the wider bitcoin community had great expectations for Neo & Bee, seeing it as a significant step towards bringing bitcoin out of the media shadows in which it often finds itself, and into the public consciousness. Its first Neo outlet, with plans for others to follow within a month, was backed by a professional image campaign rarely seen in pre-2014 'bitcoin financial services 1.0' businesses.  It stressed full reserve holdings, KYC-AML compliance, records-keeping, fiduciary duties to customers, best practices for bitcoin storage (cold storage, multi-signature), cryptographic proof of reserves and insurance against cyber attacks.  Neo has targeted a more non-technological crowd, hoping to bring new customers and stakeholders into the bitcoin fold with promises of added security and convenience. Neo conducted an extensive media and advertising campaign in Cyprus to accompany its launch.  Questions to answer  Neo & Bee also acquired some high-profile names as endorsements, most notably Andreas Antonopoulos, who was listed as the board's Technical Advisor.  As news of the suspension of trading broke, Antonopoulos was almost immediately faced with a barrage of questions on various social media sites, to which he replied.    @mccabe_brian I am a technical advisor, I have no insight into their operations or control over the management. Waiting to find out myself      — AndreasMAntonopoulos (@aantonop) March 30, 2014    Antonopoulos, who is widely respected by the bitcoin world for dedication to transparency and communication as well as his expertise, also responded to questions on reddit:    ""I have no information about the operations at Neo & Bee, I have only acted as a technical advisor. I am getting no communication from the firm and have not had any response to my messages.""      ""I have no investment involvement or insight, other than acting as a consultant on security architecture, providing advice over skype & telephone for their operations.

""We are pleased to inform that new trading instruments with Chinese offshore Yuan has been added. Now btc-e clients can trade 3 new instruments. A unique trading instruments that enables you to benefit either from price fall or increase are now available in your btc-e MetaTrader4 and WebTrader platforms under following symbols: USD/CNH (available on WebTrader only), BTC/CNH, LTC/CNH.""  'Offshore yuan' (CNH) refers to the amounts of Chinese yuan (CNY), also called renminbi (RMB), available for trade on international markets by businesses, usually at slightly higher value than the official version thanks to the added accessibility.  Offshore yuan is the fourth fiat currency offered for trading on BTC-e, the others being US dollars, Euros, and Russian rubles. It also allows trading between these currencies, as well as bitcoin and a selection of seven alternative cryptocurrencies including litecoin, namecoin and peercoin. To fund a BTC-e account with CNH, users must wire money via a National Australia Bank (NAB) account in Sydney.  BTC-e's news came just as a local Chinese exchange, Bter, announced it will halt deposits from banks due to advice related to expected stricter controls over, or outright ban on, interactions between digital currency exchanges and Chinese banks.  At publication time, the BTC/CNH price was ¥2594 ($417.5), slightly below the CNY-proper rates of ¥2755 ($443.46) on Huobi and BTC China.  Limited trade only  Thanks to strict capital controls, yuan is not freely tradable on world forex markets and its value is more rigid. It is not legal tender in Taiwan, Hong Kong or Macau, but often accepted and banks there offer yuan-denominated accounts. Hong Kong started the first offshore market in 2004.  Banks in Singapore and London also allow trading to and from CNH, and Taiwanese banks were permitted to open yuan accounts beginning 2012. Forex convertibility is limited to businesses for trade, investment and borrowing purposes and there are few, if any, chances for individuals to join in.  The Chinese government has allowed the yuan to float within a limited range since 2006, when a US dollar peg was removed.
