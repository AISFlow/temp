42425539,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIUB7h,1394062648,Will Linux Flaw Leave Bitcoiners Vulnerable to Attacks?,"A security flaw in a key cryptographic program has been revealed in the Linux gnuTLS package, an optional component for third-party bitcoin and altcoin client applications.  The gnuTLS SSL library is included in many open-source packages such as those in Red Hat, Ubuntu and Debian distributions of Linux.  Originally discovered during an audit of gnuTLS for Red Hat, the effects of the flaw are wide-reaching for developers.  Explained Ars Technica in its report:  ""[The] attacks circumvent the most widely used technology to prevent eavesdropping on the Internet, thanks to an extremely critical vulnerability in a widely used cryptographic code library.""  The bug, the source explains, is the result of commands in a section of the gnuTLS code that handle certificate verification. Estimates suggest the error could have been introduced as far back as 2005, though it was discovered on 4th March.  Further, more than 200 different operating systems and apps could be affected.    GnuTLS bug REALLY BAD: bypass SSL, TLS over 200 different OS's, Apps that rely on GnuTLS for SSL and TLS operations http://t.co/Tj7nA9R0ih      — Team Cymru (@teamcymru) March 5, 2014    The flaw, which involves errors with several ""goto cleanup"" calls, is potentially dangerous as it effectively allows someone to perform a ""man in the middle attack"", by which encrypted communications between a client and the web server can be exploited with specially crafted certificates.  Wrote Red Hat in its assessment:  ""An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate that could be accepted by gnuTLS as valid for a site chosen by the attacker.""  Impact on bitcoin users  Despite the alarm the bug has raised in the wider tech community, bitcoin lead developer Jeff Garzik told CoinDesk that the issue is unlikely to have a substantial impact on bitcoin, though some will be affected.  Explained Garzik:  ""The gnuTLS bug is pretty bad, but very few use gnuTLS in the bitcoin community. OpenSSL is standard.""  Garzik indicated that the use of OpenSSL mitigates a fork risk that is present when using other competing libraries for key software, such as gnuTLS.  He also stated that projects using OpenSSL, Mozilla NSS, Crypto++ or another crypto library are not impacted by the bug. Anyone who has compiled Bitcoind against this SSL package, however, would have an implementation that was vulnerable, he noted.  Ankur Nandwani, a developer at Bitmonet, suggested hosted wallet users and the users of bitcoin exchanges would be most affected, but stated that there are easy protections to prevent issues.    ""In both cases, an attacker can sniff users credentials, when users are trying to log-in to their account. To reduce the probability of online wallets and exchange credentials from being compromised, it is really important that everyone use two-factor authentication.""              Nandwani said that the bug is evidence that bitcoin users should reduce their reliance on online wallets and exchanges.    Implementing a fix  The gnuTLS team has since announced an update to account for the flaw, one bitcoin and altcoin users and developers in need of the fix can now upgrade to. Red Hat indicated that gnuTLS users should upgrade their packages to correct the issue, and indicated that all applications linked to the gnuTLS library must be restarted for the update to take place.  Though mistakes are resolved in version 3.2.12, they still linger among those in the public, which has invoked comparisons to other extreme errors in coding flaw history.    Gnu has an even worse networking security flaw than Apple had...

42425545,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIUBJh,1394059564,Robocoin to Debut First Traveling Bitcoin ATM at SXSW Interactive Festival,"Las Vegas-based bitcoin ATM specialist RoboCoin has revealed new plans for this week's upcoming South By Southwest (SXSW) Interactive festival, set to begin on Friday 7th March and run through 11th March.  SXSW is one of the more notable events on the annual tech calendar, having helped launched major brands such as Twitter and Foursquare.  Robocoin, which debuted the first bitcoin ATM in Vancouver in October to massive fanfare, has a similarly stylish rollout planned for its SXSW debut. Robocoin will launch four ATMs around the city to raise bitcoin awareness at the event.  The result, according to Robocoin growth guru Sam Glaser, is that attendees will have unprecedented access to bitcoin.  Said Glaser:  ""There should be no reasonable time of day where you can't go buy and sell your bitcoins from a Robocoin.""  Founded in late 2013, Robocoin is in the midst of a massive rollout of ATM units as demand for its products is escalating worldwide.  Event locations  Glaser indicated that Robocoin bitcoin ATMs will available at HandleBar, an ""old-school,"" neighborhood bar in Austin; Domincan Joe, a local coffee shop; and Central Texas Gun Works, a shooting range and firearm education facility.  Perhaps most notable, however, is the Robocoin Rover, its fourth unit.  The Robocoin Rover will be housed in the back of a moving trailer for mobile access around Austin for the four-day event, providing an experience akin to a traveling food truck.  The Robocoin Rover will be operated by Coinvault, a Houston-based firm, but Glass suggested it could become an idea it encourages more operators to consider.  ""We're going to test it at SXSW, and see how positive the response is. So far [Coinvault] is the only [company] we're talking to about, but I imagine if it's successful, it will take off.  At least one of the units will be moved during the day to the SXSW Trade show, where Robocoin can gain access to the festival's substantial audience. Last year, nearly 30,000 people attended the SXSW Interactive portion of the festival, attendance records show.  Stragetic goals  The event also has a strategic relevance for Robocoin, which is eager to showcase its units to the event's influential audience members.  Explained Glaser:  ""I think the biggest goal is to share Robocoin with a huge collection of technology journalists and influencers, and really share the information on Robocoin compliance, because that's what we've built our company around.""  Attendance records also show that SXSW could be the right event for the company to attend for this reason. Approximately 3,000 media personnel were in attendance at the event in 2013.

42425537,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIUAzh,1394050279,Poloniex Loses 12.3% of its Bitcoins in Latest Bitcoin Exchange Hack,"Digital currency exchange Poloniex, which trades bitcoin and other popular digital currencies such as litecoin, namecoin and dogecoin, has lost 12.3% of its total bitcoin supply in an attack.  The exchange took to Bitcoin Forum on 4th March to report it had been compromised by a previously unknown vulnerability in its coding.  Writing under the username Busoni, Poloniex owner Tristan D'Agosta, moved to calm concerned users by explaining what lead to the hack, as well as what the next steps from the company would be.  D'Agosta explained:  ""The hacker discovered that if you place several withdrawals all in practically the same instant, they will get processed at more or less the same time. This will result in a negative balance, but valid insertions into the database, which then get picked up by the withdrawal daemon.""  D'Agosta also detailed the exact process by which transactions on the exchange were confirmed to highlight the error, and further, took full responsibility for the loss, stating that he plans to repay the company's customers.  According to a Twitter post from the company, the original attack occurred during the early morning hours of 4th March.    Aware that markets are frozen. Some BTC was stolen. Details coming as soon as possible.      — Poloniex Exchange (@Poloniex) March 4, 2014    Behind the hack  Due to its current bitcoin shortage, Poloniex indicated that all customer balances would temporarily be reduced by 12.3% ""out of absolute necessity"". D'Agosta suggested that this was the only way that bitcoins could be distributed fairly among affected users.  ""If I did not make this adjustment, people would most likely withdraw all their BTC as soon as possible in order to make sure they weren't left in that remaining 12.3%.""  Poloniex plans to record the balances and to pay back customers using exchange fees as well as personal contributions. As a result, he indicated that all exchange fees would be temporarily raised to 1.5%, up from 0.2%. Altcoin and bitcoin withdrawals have since been reinstated, going back online on 4th March after less than a day's delay.  — Poloniex Exchange (@Poloniex) March 4, 2014  System changes  D'Agosta did also credit his design with preventing a more massive bitcoin loss. For example, he noted that the company's existing security features noticed the unusual withdrawal activity and froze affected accounts.  In the attack announcement, D'Agosta listed a number of next steps his company would follow, including updating the withdrawal daemon to check for negative balances before processing withdrawals and freezing any account with a negative balance.  According to its Twitter feed, updates have already been made.    Withdrawal system redesigned, now requests are processed sequentially from a global command queue.      — Poloniex Exchange (@Poloniex) March 5, 2014    Moving forward  D'Agosta expressed his apologies for the attack and appealed to the community for continued feedback on he could improve the service. Said D'Agosta:  ""I do not have the money to wave away the debt, so we'll need to work together.""  Response from the Bitcoin Talk community was largely positive, with many commenters posting messages of support for D'Agosta and his exchange.  Notably, the announcement follows a recent rush of attacks against bitcoin services, including Mt. Gox, Silk Road 2.0 – which has also embarked on a repayment plan, and Alberta-based ""bitcoin bank"" Flexcoin, which shut down its services on 4th March after losing $600,000 in bitcoins.

42425531,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIUArh,1394046066,KnCMiner Finalizes Design For World’s First 20nm Bitcoin ASIC Miner,"KnCMiner says it has finalized the design of what should be the world’s first 20nm bitcoin ASIC miner.  The company is still not saying much about the upcoming ASIC or the rollout schedule, it merely states that the ‘tape-out’ was achieved only three months after starting the project. The actual tape-out happened sometime in February.  In electronics, a tape-out is the last stage of the design cycle for an integrated circuit.  KnCMiner  teamed up with Alchip and Advanced Semiconductors Technology (AST) to design and produce the chip. The company points out that its first generation ASICs were delivered in three to five months.  Power friendly  KnC has not revealed any performance estimates yet, but the company is saying that the new ASIC should cut power consumption by 43%.  This sounds like a realistic estimate, as we have been hearing similar claims from chipmakers who are planning to transition from 28nm to 20nm later this year.  In addition to the new node, KnC has also optimised the design of on-die circuitry, which allowed it to stick 1440 cores in a relatively big 55 x 55mm package.  Back in November KnC said the Neptune 20nm chip would deliver at least 3TH of power, operating at 0.7 watts per GH/sec. The company was expecting a 30% reduction in power consumption and now it appears that it might beat its initial estimate.  This would not be the first time. When KnC announced the Jupiter ASIC, it promised 400GH/sec, but the chip actually operated north of 550GH/sec. However, it will be a while before we know whether Neptune can over-deliver like its predecessor.  Tricky transition  Marcus Erlandson, KnC’s CTO said he is proud of the team’s performance.  “The combined efforts of KnC and our partners Alchip means that once again we are bringing to market a world first silicon design and in record time,” he said.  President of Alchip Johnny Shen said KnC and Alchip have been working together on bitcoin ASIC design for less than a year and they have already delivered “two world-first projects”.  It is still unclear when the new ASIC will be ready for production. It usually takes several weeks between tape-out and full-scale production, but only if everything goes according to plan.  In the world of silicon chips, things can go wrong in an instant, and even big manufacturers have trouble transitioning to new manufacturing processes like TSMC’s 20nm node.

42425542,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIUBHh,1394043159,How Economist Milton Friedman Predicted Bitcoin,"Bitcoin and its crypto-cash counterparts are essentially trustless monetary systems that upend the banking establishment’s ideals of how a financial system should operate.  Intriguingly, the concept of digital money was predicted as far back as the late ’90s.  Milton Friedman  was one of the most renowned economists of the 20th century and his ideas radically changed the way that policymakers made their decisions.  Friedman foresaw that bitcoin, or something like it, could have great advantages and would inevitably be developed – much to the animosity of incumbent institutions in the financial world.  Jeffery Tucker is an economist, the founder of the Liberty.me and a regular speaker at bitcoin conferences. He says that Friedman had precognition about decentralized forms of money.  “Milton Friedman was way ahead.”  The liberating web  Friedman passed away before the arrival of bitcoin, but he lived long enough to see the Internet’s meteoric rise throughout the ’90s. By 1999, he had realized the Internet would shape authority:  “I think that the Internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government.”  Despots have come to understand this too. In the recent ‘Arab Spring’ upheavals, autocracy often did its best to suppress the uniting power of the web.  Friedman was long against ‘collectivism’, a term he used for a government that had become too all-reaching and powerful.  Fortunately, authoritarian regimes now have to deal with a new digital threat – decentralization.  Systems that lack a central authority can cause severe headaches for governments both good and bad.  Take, for example, the privacy tool Tor. This encrypted network has presented real problems for governments wanting to control and police criminal activity on the web – or, indeed, suppress free speech and activism.  What Friedman had in mind when he proposed the idea of digital cash, however, was reducing the need for a third party in transactions.  “The one thing that’s missing, but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A.”  It seems that Friedman knew the decentralization of money would arrive one day. But it’s not so certain that he willed it to happen. As Coinapult founder Erik Vorhees says:  “As the most popular champion of free markets, it’s always surprised (and dismayed) me that Friedman seemed to have little issue with central planning when it came to money itself. He would abhor central planning in basically every good, except the good of money, which is arguably the most important.”  Furthermore, Friedman advocated for abolishing the Federal Reserve, to replace it with an automated system that adjusted the money supply accordingly. It seems that he also believed the free market would bring that concept to fruition. He was right.  Anonymity fears  Bitcoin has been lauded as one of the technical innovations of its time. But it has an image problem to overcome – a common perception that is dark and lawless – created largely by the stream of sensational media reports.  Many people now believe cryptocurrencies are merely an avenue for criminality or bad behaviour, such as theft, drug dealing and gross negligence.  That’s why Friedman’s prediction that e-cash would be anonymous is concerning to many. Then again, this is an economist that believed in complete economic freedom; intervention was an impediment in his idealistic world.  The economist prophesized a method of electronic money that would be simliar to cash – a system that banking embraces, yet possesses major flaws:  “The way I can take a $20 bill, hand it over to you, and then there’s no record of where it came from.”  Eventually, Friedman’s belief that e-cash would proliferate on the Internet has proved correct, of course. Its advantages could not be ignored. One concern, however, is how legitimate could a cryptocurrency be if it were truly anonymous? Friedman saw this as a small problem that the market would eventually correct:  “You may get that (e-cash) without knowing who I am. That kind of thing will develop on the Internet and that will make it even easier for people using the internet.”  It seems Friedman knew that Silk Road would have to proliferate in order for bitcoin to become popular with the masses. On the negatives of ‘e-cash’, he said:  “Of course, it has its negative side. It means the gangsters, the people who are engaged in illegal transactions, will also have an easier way to carry on their business.”  Keeping it real  Some economists deride bitcoin because it is ‘Internet money’, and argue that it’s not ‘real’. The fact that bitcoin is a payments system with billions in market capitalization, and has a mass collective of machines confirming transactions, seems to prove nothing. But as Marc Andreessen put it for the New York Times:  “Economists who attack bitcoin today might be correct, but I’m with Ben (Bernanke) and Milton.”  Brave new world  The barriers that centralized banking has put in place have proved to be major societal problems.  Crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending and decentralized math-based currencies are new innovations, and are ideas Friedman would likely have approved of.  Mobile technology, which will shape the future of payments, would likely have been applauded too.  What also might have excited Friedman is the Seasteading Institute – a project his progeny are involved in – that has promoted the concept of creating permanent communities at sea. The institute is researching new ways to experiment with community economics outside of national borders and has embraced decentralized currencies.  “Of course, Friedman didn’t predict the block chain,” summed up Jeffery Tucker. ""But he was hoping for a trustless system. He saw the need.”  Quite a premonition, indeed.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/05/how-economist-milton-friedman-predicted-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/613296c8cba69e98d0715047bcada08317e80c9c-1190x696.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374539,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlH49,1394036402,"Bitcoin's Biggest Challenge is Educational, Not Technical","Erik Voorhees is among the top-recognised serial entrepreneurs in Bitcoin, which he views as one of the most important inventions ever created. Erik has been at the centre of the Bitcoin movement since April 2011. He is well known for his vocal advocacy of the ""separation of Money and State"".  It seems one of the greatest challenges facing Bitcoin is not technical, but educational.  The world is having a hard time coping with its new discovery. Economist and professor Peter Morici, writing for Fox News on 3rd March, has written one of the worst bitcoin articles of the year, and it must be addressed.  Gleefully simmering in our fabricated despair, Morici betrays his agenda immediately:  “Bitcoin believers were shaken to their digital souls when Mt. Gox, the world’s largest exchange, defaulted... and closed.”  In his very first sentence, facts are disregarded. Mt. Gox was barely the third largest by the time of its demise. But it’s not facts upon which Morici’s argument fails, it’s theory and philosophy.  Quantifying value  “Money,” Morici says, “provides a secure place to keep your wealth.”  Incorrect, sir. Money is a measurement of value. It is not a place, and it is not in itself “secure” any more than inches and yards are a secure location to store one’s measurements, or than minutes themselves might be entrusted to secure one’s time. He continues:  “Bitcoin traded for $1,117 on December 4, and now commands only about half that amount.”  Morici’s willingness to ignore bitcoin’s long-term track record (one of appreciation unmatched by any other asset class, anywhere) reveals the extent to which he has blinded himself.  “[Bitcoin is no place for your children’s college fund or retirement savings.” With this I must agree, but then neither is fiat, which in its best case, over a period of twenty years will scarcely measure half of its original.  “The earliest currencies were coins …” he says (wrong again, professor, but that’s not my true gripe), “often with the face of the sovereign stamped on gold or silver to instill confidence.”  Here is where petty disagreement changes to serious contention. Gold and silver needed no sovereigns stamped on them to “instill confidence.” It was the metal itself, valuable as a commodity, which made the coins desirable. Caesar’s visage was little more than marketing for the tyrant.  The fraud of fiat  Morici writes, “The Chinese issued paper money more than 2,000 years ago.”  Yes, and the vast majority of them collapsed in hyperinflation, as have over two dozen fiat currencies in only the past hundred years. That the fraud of fiat is as old as time does not mean we should continue falling victim.  And to matters of inflation, “Bitcoin advocates are riveted by the temptation of government to print too much and destroy its value through inflation.”  True, we tend to prefer money without perpetual debasement, which seems to put us at odds with professors (who, upon achieving tenure, have difficulty determining why their raise feels inadequate).  “However, inflation is hardly a problem in the United States, Europe and Japan, and central banks in other countries hold dollars, euro, and yen to back up their currencies.”  Okay professor, just as it would be hardly a problem if I took but a few percent of your assets each year for my own, indeed you may not even notice.  Morisi laments that “There is no ‘Bitland’ where a government has declared the Bitcoin legal tender to buy goods and pay taxes.” Are we in such a dismal state that even trade itself must be ordained by a king for legitimacy, professor?  Might I be permitted to breathe without a license or speak without permission of your preferred politicians? Why not then may I trade without their approval?  What anointed property is bestowed upon “dollars” which, being absent from bitcoins, precludes their usefulness? If you would not even eat your supper without the government first giving you its blessing, then I feel sad for you, for you are truly under a dismal spell and, and suffer a strange kind of man-in-the-sky worship.  Issues of privacy  Here though I must admire Morici, at least briefly, for not condemning the privacy of Bitcoin as a sign of reclusive and improper behaviour. But, it seems he resists the temptation to vilify privacy by claiming that Bitcoin simply offers none of it.  “Transactions can be spied by hackers or government security agencies through its fairly open payments system, the government can subpoena your Bitcoin records or those of your exchange when it needs.”  Professor, is it not a welcome improvement in human decency that a government must now subpoena for records, instead of calling upon its Orwellian spy arsenal – the NSA?  And while an individual, once named, can certainly have guns drawn upon him by Government, have you ever tried obtaining the name belonging to a Bitcoin account? Such a feat is not so easy, and thank goodness that at least several more barriers have been placed between the people and their rulers.  Though this is so far shallow, for the above is Morici’s basic pretense for his real thesis, displayed so eloquently at the end.  “Detractors of paper money have always been fixated by the absence of gold to back it up, but they fail to recognize what really makes a currency accepted and secure – the government guarantee and the good sense of the sovereign not to abuse its franchise.”  And he finishes with grand vision, “It’s not the gold but the face of Caesar – the promise his image carries – that makes a coin money.”  With this final beautiful prose, despite my stubborn resistance, Morici may have ultimately convinced me of his opinion.  And this is why, from this day forward, I shall with diligence stamp the face of Caesar into each slice of my bread, and carve it delicately upon my door, so that my food may always be rich and sustaining, and my home may be guaranteed its utility forever.  Bitcoin may fail for a great many reasons, Mr Morici. But if it does, it will not be for want of a tyrant’s face behind it.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Erik Voorhees,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/05/bitcoins-biggest-challenge-is-educational-not-technical,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0401a61aa41af31408b73333e0baa1b53c2e43f1-1600x1066.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The 32-year-old Internet entrepreneurs announced the news on their blog today, stating:  ""Cameron and I have decided to use our bitcoin to take the plunge, or rather propulsion, into space. Why? Because Bitcoin and Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic are two technologies that meaningfully represent our focus at Winklevoss Capital - the reduction of pain-points and friction in an effort to build a better world.""  The Winklevoss twins are best known for founding HarvardConnection (later ConnectU), a social network for students at Harvard University. The pair sued Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for $140m over the idea, dropping the suit in 2011 to accept a settlement made earlier in 2008.  Since then, the twins have become interested in bitcoin, and in July filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an investment fund based on the digital currency.  The twins remain firmly committed to bitcoin and even launched their own bitcoin price index last month called the Winkdex. In a Reddit AMA in January, Cameron said we are in new and 'uncharted waters' when it comes to digital currency, but he expressed his doubts about fiat currency.  ""I'm not sure about the US dollar and nobody I talk to is either,"" he said. ""In the last four years alone the Fed has quadrupled the money supply. At some point the music has to stop?""  He went on to say bitcoin would feel and act as mature as the US dollar in ten years. Last month, he estimated each bitcoin would, at some point, be worth $40,000.  Cameron Winklevoss said he'd spent a lot of time ""self-educating on crypto"", adding:  ""The beauty of open-source is that it adapts and evolves, so I am confident it will do so as needed.""  SpaceShipTwo  The twins will travel into space in Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo. At 60ft long and with a 90"" diameter cabin, this consumer-ready vehicle can seat six passengers.  SpaceShipTwo is partly based on the technology of SpaceShipOne, the craft that completed the first manned private spaceflight in 2004 and won the Ansari X Prize. SpaceShipOne won the $10m prize on 4th October 2004, the 47th anniversary of the launch of Sputnik 1.  It will be launched from its mothership White Knight Two. The rocket and mothership are both twice the size of their experimental 2004 predecessors, meaning extra years of test flights before anything is consumer-ready.  63 year-old Richard Branson, founder of 400-company Virgin Group, announced Virgin Galactic would accept bitcoin payments for suborbital space travel in November last year. A flight attendant from the company bought the first ticket for herself in bitcoin that same week.  Asked why he decided to accept bitcoin, Branson said:  ""Why not? Virgin Galactic is a bold entrepreneurial technology and is driving revolution – bitcoin is doing just the same.""  Branson said the 2004 test spaceflight paved the way for Virgin Galactic's tourist venture in 2014. Tickets to be among the first flight passengers to space are currently selling for $250,000, and 700 people are already in line.

At that time, the Internet was hot stuff. There were tons of burgeoning startups getting into the web game. It seemed as though every company was scrambling to get a fancy new .com address – which appeared to be the ticket to vast (albeit undetermined) riches.  You could come up with an idea, say, delivering pet supplies – and investors would go for it. Sometimes, when optimism is high, ideas will fly.  But sometimes, even though the economic realities eventually come into play. With Pets.com the hype seemed real – they even had a Super Bowl ad.  People will no longer go to pet stores, they said. Customers will sit at home and purchase that stuff from their sofa.  Mt. Gox could be compared to Pets.com as an early experiment in an emerging industry. Trying to sell pet supplies? Online? Who would have thought. Actually, it wasn't a bad idea. But it was ahead of its time.  Gox versus Pets  Any new technology will bring early adopters who will slowly bring concepts to the mainstream. Both Gox and Pets.com worked off of this ideal. The problem was the execution in between.  Pets.com had a marketing slogan that supposedly explained its business to people: “Because Pets Can't Drive!""  Of course, pets don't pay for their own food, either. The company, without any inkling of profit, went on a spending spree. Using money it raised, the company built warehouses and hired people for a service people didn't yet want.  By comparison, Mt. Gox was building a coffee shop on the ground floor of its offices. What was the assumption there? That people who stood protesting outside the company's Tokyo office would need a caffeine boost?  The exchange had engaged in a series of mishaps over the years. It's ability to run as a cutting edge platform for obtaining bitcoin was questionable at best.  Yet, people still invested in Mt. Gox. Its price premium proved to be too enticing, even though it was one of the most volatile exchanges.  Navigating bubbles  The Internet craze was a bubble back in the late 90s.  Is the race to get a bitcoin address reminiscent of the scramble for domain names? Some say a bubble can't be seen ahead of time, but that it can only be viewed when looking back.  However, at this stage there doesn’t seem to be the gold-rush mentality in bitcoin that you normally would see with an investor craze. Bitcoin is still new, and still appears to the general public as a risky investment. That’s a good thing.  It means that some of the early, antiquated bitcoin businesses can self-destruct on their own. They need to: creative destruction is necessary to go forward. Sometimes, in order to grow, things have to change.  The losses  The failure of Pets.com was swift. In less than a year after its initial public offering, the company was forced to liquidate its assets. But its $82.5m IPO was a sign that there was financial support behind the company. The fact that it lost over $300m (in 2000 dollars) shows it had no idea what it was doing.  Mt. Gox as a company never would have seen such investor interest. It had serious financial problems of over $60m it was trying to hide from users, and had its banking funds seized in the United States.  Was that part of the fall of Mt. Gox? It certainly didn't help. CEO Mark Karpeles has said that the financial system was impeding Mt. Gox to do its business:  “The pressure we got from banks and governments makes things very hard.""  Despite this, the exchange kept operating. And despite documents suggesting that Mt. Gox was trying to sell in the final hours, there were no takers.  In the end, no one wanted anything to do with the poor operational execution that Mt. Gox was renowned for. There wasn't a company within the cryptocurrency industry interested in helping to resuscitate it.  No doom  Timothy Lee of the Washington Post recently wrote: “The failure of Mt. Gox doesn't doom bitcoin any more than the failure of Pets.com doomed the Internet.""  He’s right. A fair comparison can be made that both Pets.com and Mt. Gox went down while totally screwing their investors. Mt. Gox, like Pets.com, has no future. Both companies were too early in the game. They were also too grossly mismanaged to ever be saved.  The exchange's website recently announced “A Procedure of Civil Rehabilitation"" plan. The statement even comes complete with a call center for angry investors to dial. But it's too little, too late for Mt. Gox.  Pets.com burned through its cash irresponsibly because that's what was done in those days. It dumped millions into marketing an idea that never required a business plan for investors to put money into.  Interestingly enough, Pets.com now redirects to PetSmart. That public company sells pet merchandise both online and in retail stores, profitably.  The only question now: What will MtGox.com redirect to in the future?

42425536,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIUB5h,1394022625,Ireland’s First Bitcoin ATM Will Launch in a Dublin Cafe This Week,"UPDATE: The venue for the ATM has now been moved to GSM Solutions, is fully installed and will launch at 10am on 13/03/2014.    A Lamassu bitcoin ATM machine, from Irish provider BitVendo, is to be launched at Hippety’s Cafe in the Temple Bar area of Dublin in the next few days.  With the new ATM just a stone’s throw from the Central Bank of Ireland, “there’s no way the Irish banks can ignore bitcoin now”, BitVendo, told CoinDesk.  Coming hot on the heels of the installation of the UK’s first bitcoin ATM in London, BitVendo say that it intends to roll out ATMs across Ireland and the UK, with three more expected this year.  Bank bitterness  The 2008 financial crisis hit Ireland particularly hard. Although the worst has now passed, the country had to go cap in hand to the EU and IMF for billions of euros in bailout money, which came with harsh strings attached.  At the end of 2013, it finally left the bailout programme, but distrust in the banking system has remained, says Giles Byrne, head of marketing at BitVendo:  “Initially people think the banks are behind bitcoin and are instantly turned off. There is huge hatred towards the banking system here, and some people want to support us purely to spite the banks.”  Bitcoin growth  As in other countries, bitcoin services and groups have begun to pop-up in Ireland.  These include bitcoin broker Eircoin.net and the Irish Bitcoin Foundation, which in January called for the Irish Central Bank to regulate bitcoin. Irish companies accepting bitcoin include a CCTV provider, a farmhouse B&B and a mobile phone store.  BitVendo was founded in July 2013 and was born out of frustration at the difficulty of buying bitcoin in Ireland, says Byrne:  “We were shocked to see how difficult it was. In Ireland the only people selling it were charging twice the going rate, so at that point we decided something should be done.”  The group then spent $5,000 on an ATM, an investment that could have netted them a $115,000 profit if it had been invested directly in bitcoin, Byrne notes. That discrepancy motivates the team, he says.  Image problem  As well as providing ATMs, BitVendo intends to offer a brokerage service in future, as well as “very personal cold storage for VIP clients”.  As well as trying to run a profitable business, Byrne says, BitVendo will have to keep fending off loaded media reports associating bitcoin with crime:  “We still haven’t seen our business mentioned in Irish media without the drugs on Silk Road, the Mt. Gox crash or general money laundering being mentioned too. More drugs are bought with cash than bitcoin, but the Irish media enjoys the glamour of crime.”  Bitcoin for Guinness  Meanwhile, the Baggot Inn in central Dublin has revealed on Twitter that it received its first bitcoin payment for a pint of Guinness yesterday. The pub claims this is the first pint of Guinness to be paid for in bitcoin in Ireland.

42425546,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIUBLh,1394018727,"Ripple Courts Developers, Entrepreneurs With New Initiatives","Ripple Labs is on the lookout for developers and entrepreneurs alike this week.  The Ripple Accelerator, an incubator designed to help companies using the Ripple protocol, opened in San Francisco. And Ripple Labs, the firm behind the open-source digital payment protocol, has launched a developer offensive to encourage third-party apps and services to support it.  The Ripple Accelerator is designed as an independent entity, not influenced by Ripple Labs. It is operated by CrossCoin Ventures, a separate group of four partners, two of whom run the Menlo Incubator. However, it is located in the same building as Ripple Labs, which is providing office space and funding.  At arms length  Ripple Labs CEO Chris Larsen and CrossCoin Ventures partner Adam Marsh nevertheless maintain that there is an arms length relationship between the companies, to avoid any conflict of interest.  To that end, while Ripple provides funding in the form or XRP, it won't take an equity stake in any companies that it funds. Neither does it get any input into what companies are chosen, says Marsh. He stated:  ""I'd like to see a dozen companies launched over the next twelve months or so at a minimum. I'd like to see quite a few of those go onto the next stage of the market and get some adoption. The areas we're looking at are pretty diverse,""  Marsh added that CrossCoin Ventures is offering up to $50,000 in funding to new firms. Companies already on its radar are tackling business services including remittance, microtransactions, wallets, merchant solutions, and analytics products.  About Ripple  Ripple is a payment system that also has its own currency, called ripple (also known as XRP). The currency is designed as a vehicle to send other currencies across the network. It supports any currency, but requires gateways to transfer them in and out of the network. Larsen describes it as ""SWIFT 2.0"", referring to the incumbent international payment system.  Ripple  , formally known as OpenCoin, has launched a developer portal designed to bring together tools and resources for the developer community. These include an API for its payment network, based on the popular REST API standard.  The firm has also developed a bounty program for third-party developers, to encourage them to create services for its combined protocol and payment network.  The first one has already been claimed, said Larsen; developer Mathijs Koenraadt developed a Ripple extension to e-commerce platform Magento, which enables it to read the Ripple public ledger and create an invoice.  The initial claim on the bounty was 400,000 XRP, which is about $6,000. European luxury jewellery outlet Rita Zachari has adopted it, and is one of the first merchants to offer a Ripple Wallet payment option at checkout, said the company. Larsen said:  ""There is no firm limit or timeline on future bounties, if something is adding to the overall utility of the protocol, then it's a good thing to do, and we should support that.""  This is the latest in a growing developer push for Ripple Labs. The firm finally open sourced its formerly proprietary server code in September, at its first developer conference.  It is also developing its own concept apps to show developers how it's done. It created an iOS client (without the ability to send currency), and published it in Apple's App store, publishing a lengthy blog post about it. Such posts will appear in the dev blog in the future, said spokespeople.  Ripple Labs received its initial funding in a round including Andreessen Horowitz almost a year ago, and has been adding to that ever since, having amassed around $9m so far from firms including Google Ventures.  Cranking the handle  Why is the firm launching its developer initiative almost one year, one name change, and after the departure of the CTO who created the protocol in the first place? Is it trying to turn the crank harder to bolster slow Ripple adoption?  At the time of writing, over the last 24 hours the Ripple network had processed around $42,000 in XRP/USD trades, and around 90 bitcoins in XRP/BTC. Conversely, Bitstamp (Ripple's primary bitcoin gateway), traded 21,000 bitcoins for USD during the same period.  Gateway support has also been slow to emerge. The firm has support from several: the main one is Bitstamp, but it also has RippleChina, rippleCN, RippleIsrael, The Rock Trading, WisePass, Dividend Rippler, TTBit, RippleUnion, Justcoin, XRPChina, Peercover, Ripple Singapore, and NoFiatCoin.  It also signed with SnapSwap and ZipZap for cash payments, but ZipZap was forced to back away from its relationship after losing support from partner SoftGate.  Many of these gateways seem set up purely to serve Ripple, though, and the lack of support from large financial service providers is notable. If you want to move a few thousand pounds in sterling from the UK's Barclays Bank to Canada's RBC, for example, you're out of luck.  Larsen says he has support from three large Wall Street institutions, but can't say exactly who they are.  Nevertheless, he is happy with the network's growth. Developer initiatives simply take a long time, he protested. ""It's a lot of work. Being open source was a prerequisite,"" he said, adding that the company has tripled its development team to 40 people since then.  ""To do a developer portal right takes a while. REST is the gold standard in APIs, and it takes a while to do that effectively, and document it. It may not have been visible from the outside, but inside, there was a ton of hard, foundational stuff, and now we're ready to bring that out.""  Ripple plans to flick the switch on the developer portal today, and it will be available here.

42425538,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIUB3h,1394014430,Mobile Bitcoin ATM Debuts at Berlin Payments Hackathon,"An interesting hackers’ event held in Berlin last month saw the development of a pocket-friendly bitcoin ATM.  The mPOS (mobile point of sale) Hackathon was held at the sidelines of the Merchant Payments Ecosystem 2014 event on 18th - 30th February, and attracted a number of German developers, including Meinhard Benn.  Benn came up with a simple Android app that can turn most Android devices into rudimentary bitcoin ATMs. Of course, the mobile ATM cannot dispense or accept cash, and it doesn’t look like a typical ATM, but it does work.  DIY technology  The Pocket Bitcoin ATM app can be used with a PIN card reader and that's about all the hardware you'll need to make a transaction – apart from an Android device running 4.2.2 Jelly Bean or higher.  In the demo, Benn used a Miura Shuttle chip-and-PIN card reader and a proprietary Payworks mPOS software developers’ kit, which allowed in-app payments and payment processing at the back-end.  An open-source bitcoin wallet and the bitcoinj library were used to initiate BTC transactions.  Once the system is set up, the process is straightforward, as outlined in the Payworks blog:  Merchant opens Bitcoin ATM app on their phone  Customer enters desired amount and destination bitcoin address  Customer inserts credit or debit card in reader, confirms and pays  Bitcoins are sent from merchant’s wallet to customer’s bitcoin address  Merchant collects funds from their account with payment provider  Payworks points out that the portable system would be easy to set up in small meet-ups, conferences and other events that might benefit from bitcoin microtransactions.  Teething troubles  Of course, apps developed at hackathons don’t tend to look or operate like mature products. There are a number of limitations to consider, as explained on the ATM GitHub page.  Benn’s app features execute transactions that are registered only locally. In a real-world application, the back-end would have to look them up using the SDK.  There are a few minor glitches too: the app can hang during a firmware update, and it exhibits “unexpected behaviour” when confronted with screen rotations.  However, we have to admit we have a thing for DIY ATMs made using off-the-shelf components. Last month, a team of Canadian enthusiasts created the first dogecoin ATM using a Nexus 7 tablet glued to a briefcase.  Fast-paced industry  The other thing to consider is the mind-boggling pace of development in the gadget industry.  Apple introduced Touch ID on the iPhone 5S last year and just last week Samsung entered the fray with the Galaxy S5, which also features a fingerprint sensor. Biometric authentication can now be performed by consumer gear, including Robocoin's trademark bitcoin ATM.  Technologies built on top of Bluetooth 4.0 LE, including Apple’s iBeacon and Qualcomm’s Gimbal beacon, are designed for interactive POS use in a retail setting, or in the hospitality industry – and they’re coming to more and more mobile devices.  Lastly, wearables like the Nymi smart wristband (which scans the user’s heartwave for biometric authentication) could offer ‘always on’ authentication, making mobile payments or mobile ATMs even more attractive.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | DOGE | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/05/mobile-bitcoin-atm-debuts-at-berlin-payments-hackathon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df27a76b5080f540a47b6f9b9d4b2921d617331f-1024x610.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
