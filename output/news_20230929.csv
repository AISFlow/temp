18196378,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553554,1696028425,LINK Price Primed For Meteoric Rise: Analyst Predicts 130% Rally To $18,"The LINK price is no stranger to bullish rallies, and in September alone, the token has gone from a low of $5.8 to a peak of $7.9. Even now, bullish momentum among enthusiasts has not waned, especially with a 130% price increase prediction from a crypto analyst. LINK Price Prediction Ahead Of October In the analysis posted to TradingView, pseudonymous analyst Babenski explains the reasoning behind the $18 surge presented in their chart. First, it points to the $5.8 low that was recorded back in mid-September which is identified as the accumulation range. Related Reading: What Is Behind The 16% PEPE Price Recovery And Will It Continue? This is not out of the ordinary given the massive buying that took place when the LINK price fell to $5.8. This accumulation was the reason behind the support that was generated shortly after, which served as the lift-off point for the rally toward $8. Despite already seeing a nice 35% jump from its September lows, the analyst sees further upside. Putting the peak of the rally at $18 means that the LINK price could rise another 130% if it plays out as expected. LINK rally to $18 | Source: Tradingview.com The first roadblock is a retracement that was placed just above the $8 level, and LINK is already seeing a similar retracement after almost touching $8. Going by the analyst’s chart, the price could decline a bit further before picking up once more and then shooting straight to $18. There is no timeframe added for when the LINK price would reach this price. But with September drawing to a close, October-November is more likely. LINK Whales Take Initiative The accumulation trend pointed out above has been mainly mounted by the LINK whales. Crypto analyst @ali_charts shared a chart on X (formerly Twitter) that showed that whales holding between 10,000 and 1,000 coins have been the main buyers. According to Ali, these whales bought up more than 7.5 million tokens in a matter of weeks which translated to about $53 million spent buying LINK. As the LINK price has risen, these holders are seeing profit on their purchase, which could explain the downward correction in the LINK price in the last day. #Chainlink whales have purchased over 7.5 million $LINK in the last two weeks, worth around $53 million! pic.twitter.com/jlu8stIB0r — Ali (@ali_charts) September 28, 2023 Related Reading: Factors That Suggest A Recovery For The ADA Price Nevertheless, the digital asset remains bullish, especially with the whales still holding more than 206 million coins.

18194828,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553584,1696024800,Cosmos Has A Grand Plan For 2024: Will It Crush Ethereum?,"Cosmos, a blockchain where developers can create custom chains that interconnect and communicate, has revealed its roadmap for 2024. According to an X post on September 25, the roadmap centers on increasing modularity, improving the developer experience, addressing “technical debt,” and driving user adoption. With this, Cosmos developers plan to take on the more established platform, Ethereum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes Turnaround: Could A New All-Time High Be On The Horizon? Analyst Predicts At the heart of Cosmos are features such as Tendermint, a consensus system that anchors blockchains such as the BNB Chain; Cosmos SDK, a software developer kit that allows coders to build fluid and custom blockchains; and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), from where all deployed custom Cosmos chains can connect and communicate, effectively driving interoperability. Cosmos Wants To Repay The Technical Debt And Make Its SDK More Modular In 2024, reading from the roadmap, Cosmos aims to solidify its position by attracting developers from competing platforms as they repay the “technical debt.” In app development, technical debt leads to extra work and can be caused by resource constraints and shifting code requirements. Cosmos will expand its developer base to repay this debt and make the Cosmos SDK more modular. Although the team claims the SDK has been modular in theory, swapping and modifications have made practical implementation more challenging. Therefore, to tackle these challenges, the work already done on Cosmos SDK will continue into 2024. Then, the goal will be to make the kit more modular at the core. This will make it more adaptable and flexible, meeting developer requirements. Ethereum Is Still Dominant It is yet to be seen whether this will be achievable in 2024 and whether Cosmos will grow as dominant as Ethereum. Currently, Ethereum is the leading smart contract platform, based on its market cap and the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi). Additionally, its ecosystem of layer-2s has been increasing, with more protocols and blockchains connecting to Ethereum to take advantage of the network’s pioneering activity. Related Reading: MATIC Price Rally Threatened As Whales Deposit Millions Of Tokens To Exchanges DeFiLlama data on September 29 shows that all the top 10 bridges are connected to Ethereum.

Besides Stargate, other bridges are Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible and predominantly connect to Ethereum layer-2s and Polygon, the sidechain. For example, the zkSync Era, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, and the Optimism Gateway, are plugged into Ethereum. Cumulatively, these bridges move millions of dollars worth of tokens to and from Ethereum at any instance.

Given the number of Bitcoins held and the pace of accumulation, MSTR will likely offer investors better returns than a spot Bitcoin ETF, assuming the SEC approves the pending applications. MSTR's downside risk is limited by the fact that it has a core software business whose performance is not influenced by Bitcoin's price fluctuations. Investors still need to be aware of the risks, including the heavy reliance on debt and stock issuances to fund Bitcoin purchases. The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) prolonged delay to render a formal decision on several spot Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETF proposals, including submissions from applicants such as BlackRock ( BLK ) and Invesco ( IVZ ), is disappointing news for investors looking to gain exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency through these proposed ETF products. However, for investors familiar with MicroStrategy Inc ( MSTR ) and its successful (so far) Bitcoin strategy, the long delays by the SEC to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF only serves to strengthen the appeal of MSTR, which is in my opinion one of the most convenient ways to currently gain exposure to Bitcoin through a stock brokerage account. MSTR is one of the largest publicly traded corporate holders of Bitcoin in the world thanks to a business strategy adopted in August 2020 that has seen the company aggressively accumulate Bitcoin over time using excess cash and proceeds from debt and equity fundraising. As of July 31, MSTR held 152,800 bitcoins acquired for a total cost of $4.53 billion or $29,672 per bitcoin, according to its Q2 2023 earnings presentation . Of the total holdings, 15,731 bitcoins are held at MicroStrategy, the parent, and are pledged as collateral for the company's 2028 secured notes. The remaining 137,069 Bitcoins, or roughly 90% of its total Bitcoin holdings, are fully unpledged and unencumbered. This buy-and-hold approach has defined MSTR's Bitcoin's strategy since inception 3 years ago, explaining the strong correlation between Bitcoin's price return and MSTR's return over this period. As the chart below illustrates, Bitcoin has returned 149% in the past 3 years vs. MSTR's 117%. Seeking Alpha MSTR is not the only game in town for investors looking to potentially profit from Bitcoin's price action. Stocks like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ), Bitcoin miners such as Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), and crypto exchanges like Coinbase ( COIN ), have historically moved in tandem with the price of Bitcoin. However, unlike these stocks, MSTR has an underlying core business whose financial performance is not impacted by near-term Bitcoin price fluctuations. This is a strong competitive advantage. Stable core business limits downside risk MSTR is an enterprise software company that has been providing business intelligence products and services for decades. MSTR employs about 2000 employees, including engineering teams that work in its core product. It has a solid customer base that includes brands like Hilton Hotels and Sony Interactive Entertainment and generates fairly predictable annual revenues, with sales of $499.3 million in 2022, $510.8 million in 2021, $480.7 million in 2020, and $486.3 million in 2019. Analysts expect it to earn $500.7 million this year. A key strategic initiative currently underway in MSTR's core business is the transitioning of its business intelligence customers to the cloud. This involves a shift away from generating revenue from product licenses to generating revenues from subscriptions. So far, the subscription model is proving to be successful with high renewal rates. ""Customer renewal rates were 93% for the quarter and remained above 90% for the sixth consecutive quarter, continuing to demonstrate the durability of our customer base even with a tough macroeconomic backdrop,"" noted Andrew Kang, Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer in the Q2 earnings call . In keeping with technological trends, MSTR's core business intelligence platform is also integrating with AI, particularly generative AI and deep learning. In Q2, MSTR expanded its relationship with Microsoft ( MSFT ), announcing a multiyear partnership that integrates MSTR's analytics capabilities with the Azure OpenAI service and Microsoft 365. The partnership also makes MSTR's products and services available on the Azure Marketplace. MSTR is also pursuing new innovations through MicroStrategy Lightning, which aims to leverage on the Bitcoin network to enable new e-commerce use cases and tackle cybersecurity challenges. While I'm not convinced these innovations and strategic initiatives will lead to explosive topline growth, I do believe that they are credible signs that MSTR's core business is healthy and will likely continue providing stable and sufficient cash to cover operational costs. This limits the downside risk to its share price, which implies a valuation that is roughly in line with the valuation of the broader software industry. MSTR has a Price to Sales (P/S) ratio of 7.1, which is at par with the average P/S of 7.14 for the software industry (system & application), according to industry data compiled by NYU Stern Professor Aswath Damodaran. From a P/S standpoint, MSTR is fairly valued at the present share price when compared with other software companies. The only thing, however, is that MSTR is not just any software company. In addition to the software business, it owns more than 137,000 unencumbered Bitcoins (and counting). This explains why the stock has been outperforming a broad selection of assets in recent years. Since adopting its Bitcoin strategy 3 years ago, MSTR has not only outperformed Bitcoin itself, but has also outpaced key assets and indices, including some of the leading Big Tech and enterprise software stocks. Microstrategy Access to low-cost capital a major advantage Another major reason why MSTR is a compelling choice for investors looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin is the fact that it is able to raise capital at attractive terms. Its outstanding debt and convertible notes of $2.2 billion have a bundled weighted average interest rate of approximately 1.6%, according to the company. This is compared to the blended weighted average interest rate of 2.1% at the end of 2022, which equates to a decrease of over $15 million in annualized interest expense. Being able to utilize low interest debt to accumulate Bitcoin is a smart move in my opinion since the value of the Bitcoin will likely surpass the cost of the debt and interest payment as crypto market conditions improve in the next few quarters due to factors such as possible ETF approvals by the SEC, the Bitcoin halving event in Q2 2024, and the potential for lower interest rates amid falling inflation. The issuance of new shares to raise capital is another important financing opportunity for MSTR. Since the third quarter of 2021, MSTR has raised a total of $1.7 billion in gross proceeds through At-the-Market (ATM) offerings with the average price of all issuances of approximately $424 per share, as per the company CFO. The primary use of ATM proceeds has been to acquire additional bitcoin. MicroStrategy What makes MSTR's ATM program unique is that it has a very low outstanding share count when compared with other players in the Bitcoin space like MARA and RIOT that regularly utilize regular stock offerings to raise financing. MSTR's total outstanding shares increased from 11.3 million in 2021 to 14.1 million in the most recent quarter. MARA, in comparison, has seen its outstanding shares jump from 102.7 million in 2021 to 174.2 million in the most recent quarter, while RIOT's count has increased from 117.3 million in 2021 to 185.3 million in the most recent quarter. A lower share count means that MSTR has more room to raise additional equity financing in future. Tellingly, MSTR on Sept. 24 sold a total of 403,362 of its shares for net proceeds of ~$147.3M, enabling it to make Bitcoin purchases for the same amount. Investors should expect more of these as the company leverages on its equity to acquire more Bitcoin. Concluding with a word on risk factors Before concluding, a word on some of the risks that come with buying MSTR is necessary. The first risk I foresee is that any potential decision by MSTR to dispose of part or all its Bitcoin for whatever reason in the future may lead to a disproportionately negative reaction by investors. The company must therefore continue taking on debt and diluting investors in order to sustain the Bitcoin strategy. There is also no assurance that it will be able to continue raising capital on attractive terms, especially if the price of Bitcoin continues to move sideways as it has in recent months, or worse, declines sharply. It's instructive to note that, during the last crypto bear market in 2022, a lot of crypto firms went under due to overleveraging themselves. Another factor that makes MSTR a potentially risky investment is the difficulty in valuing the company. Although investors can utilize the P/S ratio to get a sense of its valuation as a software company, this only tells half the story as MSTR is also a Bitcoin holding company. Moreover, the company's Bitcoin holdings lead to frequent impairment charges due to GAAP accounting policies that require the firm to recognize impairments quarterly if there is a change in the fair value of its Bitcoin holdings. This makes it difficult to compare year-over-year data due to the volatility of the price of Bitcoin over any given timeframe. As an example, MSTR recorded a Bitcoin impairment charge of $24 million in Q2 2023 in contrast to $918 million in Q2 of last year. These wild swings in impairment charges make comparing MSTR's net income over different time periods impractical, adding a layer of complexity to the already laborious process of valuing the company. These risks notwithstanding, I'm bullish on MSTR. For investors looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin, MSTR could be a better option than waiting for a spot Bitcoin ETF to come to market as I suspect the price of Bitcoin will have already moved up significantly by the time the SEC formally approves any of the pending ETF applications. MSTR can allow investors to lock in these potential Bitcoin price gains early. The arguments outlined in this article -- such as MSTR's core business limiting the downside risk to the stock, and the company's ability to raise capital at attractive terms to buy more Bitcoin -- are also compelling reasons to consider the stock over a spot Bitcoin ETF.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ICO | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4638208-microstrategy-stock-is-better-bitcoin-etf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/18194427.jpeg

The beleaguered crypto lender was among a rash of digital asset companies that froze their customers’ accounts and eventually collapsed after FTX blew up last fall. The restructuring plan, which more than 90% of creditors approved, will enable BlockFi to recover the assets it lost to crypto exchange FTX and failed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, allowing the lender to put more money in creditors’ pockets, the company said.  “Success in this [process] could increase client recoveries, depending on the product and jurisdiction,” according to the notice sent to creditors.  Lawyers for BlockFi did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  A bankruptcy court must greenlight the plan to finalize it, BlockFi said in the email. Once it's approved, the company will be cleared to distribute the related funds to its creditors.  Customers holding funds in BlockFi Interest Accounts or BlockFi Retail Loans should get their funds back within the next few months, the company said.

42409631,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcM7x6,1696020474,The Most Pressing Issue on Ethereum is Validator Size Growth,"On Thursday, September 14, Ethereum protocol developers made a last-minute decision to include an additional code change in the forthcoming Cancun/Deneb upgrade as a stopgap to the issue of validator set size growth. The short timeframe under which this decision was made has sparked controversy in the Ethereum community. Anthony Sassano, the creator of Ethereum-focused media site The Daily Gwei, said the decision “needed a lot more discussion, research, and thought.” Ryan Berckmans, founder of Ethereum payments app 3cities, tweeted that in his view the situation was not urgent enough to warrant a change to the Cancun/Deneb upgrade.  Christine Kim is a Vice President on the Research team at Galaxy Digital. This op-ed, part of CoinDesk’s “Staking Week,” is based on information and data from a Galaxy Research report called “Paths Toward Reducing Validator Set Size Growth.” To read the full report, visit galaxy.com/research.  Though it only took one week for Ethereum protocol developers to come to consensus about making a change to Cancun/Deneb, the larger issue of Ethereum’s validator set size growth has been a major topic of discussion and concern among developers for months. On July 13, when the proposal to cap the validator churn limit in Cancun/Deneb was first raised by “Dapplion,” a pseudonymous developer for the Lodestar client, on ACDC #113, developers acknowledged the time-sensitive nature of the matter. “The [validator attestation] aggregation is almost at its capacity today. If we drop more validators on the network, it can really get worse,” said Mikhail Kalinin, a developer for the Teku client, on the call.  During testing for a new Ethereum test network called Holesky, developers noticed that at 2.1 million validators, which was three times the size of Ethereum’s mainnet validator set at the time, the testnet struggled to finalize due to an excessive number of attestations (messages) being propagated through Ethereum’s peer-to-peer network. Eventually, developers settled on designing Holesky to support two times the size of Ethereum’s mainnet validator set, or 1.4 million validators. Once Holesky launches, it will be an invaluable resource for developers to monitor and assess both the health of Ethereum, as well as future code changes, on a large validator set.  However, the rate at which Ethereum’s validator set size is growing will soon make Holesky’s value obsolete. As of September 15, 2023, there are 806,759 active validators on Ethereum. Since the activation of staked ETH withdrawals in the Shanghai/Capella upgrade on April 12, the number of active validators has increased 43%. Without developer intervention, the number of Ethereum validators is set to exceed 1 million by the end of this year, assuming the maximum number of validators are activated on Ethereum, and no validators exit the network. Ethereum mainnet will reach a validator set size of 1.4 million under these same assumptions by March 2023.  Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7514 caps the growth of the validator set to eight validator entries per epoch (~6.4 mins). The addition of EIP 7514 to Cancun/Deneb buys developers a few more months to address the issue of validator set size growth, as the following chart shows:  Notice from the chart, though, that this upgrade only buys developers roughly two more months of time before Ethereum’s validator set size grows beyond the size of its largest testnet Holesky. Projections about the validator set featured in the chart above are based on two key assumptions. The first assumption is that Cancun/Deneb is activated in January 2024. The second assumption is that the staking appetite by Ethereum holders is sustained above the maximum churn for the next several months. This may not be the case given that the number of validators in the entry queue has been declining. The following chart depicts the total number of Ethereum validators in the entry queue since the Merge upgrade last year:  Though it is difficult to predict how quickly the Ethereum validator set will grow, it is likely to grow by some measure over the next several months because of the proliferation of liquid staking solutions. Liquid staking solutions lower the barrier to entry for many users to stake their ETH by allowing ETH holders to stake under the 32 ETH threshold and do so without giving up the full liquidity of their asset. Therefore, it’s likely that the problem of a growing validator set is an issue that will only continue to get worse over time if left unaddressed.  Despite the rather last-minute nature of the decision on September 14, developers have acted prudently by including EIP 7514 in Cancun/Deneb. Instead of gambling with the future of Ethereum, developers are correcting their lack of foresight by including a code change that will ensure a predictable maximum growth rate for the validator set of Ethereum while buying time to work on a more significant upgrade that will almost certainly be necessary. One week before the decision on EIP 7514 was made, protocol developers were not aligned on the severity of Ethereum’s validator set size issue, but the rapid turnaround time for consensus on this decision highlights how developers have agreed that this change is the safest to protect a network worth billions of dollars.  And the conversation about Ethereum’s validator set size growth does not end with EIP 7514. As discussed, EIP 7514 simply buys Ethereum developers more time to design long-term solutions, but not that much time. If appetite for staking on Ethereum does not meaningfully abate over the next several months, the size of Ethereum’s validator set will become problematic with or without EIP 7514. Whether developers should consider a more aggressive cap on validator churn, devote more time to researching ways to increase the effective validator balance, or consider different long-term solutions, are all topics of conversations that protocol developers will have in the months ahead.  It is of utmost importance that the broader Ethereum community participates in these discussions, and this time, the broader Ethereum community should not be caught off guard. Awareness about EIP 7514 may be the starting point for many in the Ethereum community about the issue of validator set size growth but it certainly should not be the last time the community speaks up about this issue. There are more radical changes to validator economics and network monetary policy that protocol developers are exploring to address validator growth in the medium to long run.  The Ethereum community has a responsibility to hold developers accountable in their decision-making process about the development of the Ethereum protocol. Instead of slowing the decision-making process, members of the Ethereum community should be driving this process by making their voices heard about the most pressing issues on Ethereum. Rather than oppose this upgrade due to its urgency, the community should be pushing for its inclusion, because the issue at stake is real, serious, and urgent.

18192427,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553530,1696019429,"Court Rules Sam Bankman-Fried Will Remain In Jail Through Trial, Here’s Why","During a court hearing held on Thursday, September 28, 2023, the Court ruled that the former CEO of now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX Sam Bankman-Fried aka SBF will remain in jail throughout his trial. Sam Bankman-Fried To Remain In Jail Throughout His Trial At the brief court hearing on Thursday at the Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers requested that the court should temporarily release their client so he could be able to prepare his defense against the charges raised against him. However, the judge overseeing the case Judge Lewis A. Kaplan has denied the request as he believes the Defendant is a flight risk. Related Reading: Important Events That Could Have A Massive Impact On XRP Price “The closer we get to trial, the more I’m wondering about that. Your client in the event of conviction could be looking at a very long sentence. If things begin to look bleak … maybe the time would come when he would seek to flee.” Judge Kaplan stated in the court hearing in Manhattan federal court. Bankman-Fried’s lead lawyer Mark Cohen then argued that there was no reason for his client to try and flee. Cohen told Judge Kaplan that his request was made due to him being unable to meaningfully confer with his client Bankman-Fried as long as he is jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. In response, Assistant US Attorney Danielle Kudla told Judge Kaplan that Sam Bankman-Fried already had enough time to prepare for his trial. Kudla pointed out that Bankman-Fried had more than seven months to review his evidence and better prepare for his trial from the comfort of his parent’s home in Palo Alto, California since his freedom was not revoked until July 2023. Sam Bankman-Fried was extradited to the United States from the Bahamas in December last year and he was placed on house arrest in his parent’s home in Palo Alto, California where he had limited access to electronic devices until he was jailed on August 11, 2023, by Judge Kaplan. Sam Bankman-Fried was denied a $250 million bond by Judge Kaplan after the judge discovered that Bankman-Fried tried to tamper with and influence potential witnesses testifying against him. However, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan pondered on what Cohen had said and he stated that the court would arrange for Cohen and other lawyers to meet with Bankman-Fried most of the trial days at 7:00 AM at the court to speak with Bankman-Fried hours before the testimony begins. Bankman-Fried’s trial is set to begin on Tuesday, October 3, 2023, and it is expected to last more than 6 weeks. His lawyers already lost two other bail appeals before now. This marks the third time that the Defendant’s request to be released during his trial will be rejected by the court. Prosecutors Bring Several Allegations Against FTX Founder CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to several allegations brought against him following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX back in November 2022. Prosecutors accused Bankman-Fried of allegedly deceiving customers and investors to enrich himself and other executives while playing a major role in FTX’s multibillion-dollar collapse in November last year. Related Reading: $9 Trillion BlackRock Sees Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval Delayed, What This Means It was believed that Bankman-Fried stole billions of dollars in FTX customer deposits to resolve Alameda Research debts – a crypto hedge fund governed by him, live lavishly in the Caribbean, and fund political campaigns.

18190773,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553578,1696015859,MATIC Price Downtrend Halted As Google Cloud Joins Polygon Network,"Google Cloud, the renowned cloud computing service provided by Google, has made a significant move by becoming a validator on the Polygon (MATIC) network. This collaboration aims to bolster the security of the Polygon Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network, with Google Cloud employing its infrastructure, which powers popular platforms like YouTube and Gmail, to contribute to the network’s integrity. Google Cloud Strengthens Polygon Network Security Polygon Labs, the team behind the Polygon protocol, recently announced that Google Cloud has joined their validator set. This move brings Google Cloud into the fold of over 100 validators responsible for verifying transactions on the Layer 2 Ethereum (ETH) network offered by Polygon. Related Reading: This Bullish Combination Has Finally Formed For Bitcoin, Rally Ahead? In a statement shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), Polygon highlighted the significance of Google Cloud’s involvement, emphasizing utilizing the same infrastructure that underpins YouTube and Gmail to safeguard the fast and cost-effective Ethereum-based Polygon protocol. According to the announcement, by joining forces with over 100 other validators, Google Cloud adds to the collective efforts to secure the Polygon PoS Network. Including reputable and security-focused validators like Google Cloud provides an additional layer of confidence for Heimdall, Bor, and the Polygon PoS ecosystem users. The collaboration between Google Cloud and Polygon Labs extends beyond a validator partnership. It is described as an ongoing strategic collaboration, indicating a long-term commitment to advancing the adoption and development of Web3 technologies. As part of their joint efforts, Google Cloud APAC released a YouTube video titled “Polygon Labs is solving for a Web3 future for all,” further underscoring their shared vision for a decentralized web. The Google Cloud team further stated: Is there an easier way to build and grow Web3 products? That’s the mission of Polygon Labs, and with the help of Google Cloud, it’s one step closer to making this vision a reality. We are now serving as a validator on the Polygon PoS network, contributing to the network’s collective security, governance, and decentralization alongside 100+ other validators. Overall, the involvement of Google Cloud, a prominent player in the cloud computing industry, as a validator on the Polygon network brings increased credibility and expertise to the ecosystem. This collaboration is expected to enhance Polygon’s network infrastructure’s overall security and reliability, benefiting users who rely on the platform for seamless and efficient blockchain transactions. MATIC Breaks Free From 3-Month Downtrend Polygon’s native cryptocurrency, MATIC, has successfully broken a 3-month downtrend that had pushed the token to reach a yearly low of $0.5040 on Wednesday. However, in the past 24 hours, there has been a notable rebound in MATIC’s price, experiencing a 1.7% surge and currently trading at $0.5240. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes Turnaround: Could A New All-Time High Be On The Horizon? Analyst Predicts This upward movement is further supported by the Squeeze Momentum Indicator, which has broken the downtrend pattern, indicating the initiation of a recovery phase for MATIC since Friday. It is important to note that MATIC’s ADX indicator displays a spike downwards, suggesting low volatility and a neutral battle between bullish and bearish forces in the cryptocurrency market. Looking ahead, MATIC faces obstacles around the $0.5442 zone, which it failed to surpass on September 21. Conversely, if the uptrend continues, the next significant hurdle lies at $0.5951 before reaching the $0.6000 level, which has not been achieved since late August. The sustainability of MATIC’s uptrend and its ability to strive towards its yearly high of $1,569, reached in February, remains uncertain and will require further observation.

42409629,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcM7qU,1696015650,"Bitcoin Slips Below $27K, but What Might Government Shutdown Mean for Prices?","While Bitcoin (BTC) remains on track to end its six-year streak of September losses, a modest pullback ahead of what could be an imminent federal government shutdown could put this month’s advance in jeopardy.  The largest crypto by market capitalization changed hands at $26,800 during Friday afternoon hours, posting a 3.2% return this month so far. However, BTC has declined 1.6% from the $27,400 it touched for a short time on Thursday.  Extending this weak price action into the weekend could put BTC’s provisional positive monthly return in jeopardy as the crypto began September at just about $26,000.  Ether (ETH) traded mostly flat at around $1,660, as market participants anticipate futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETF) to go live early next week.  Ripple’s XRP, Solana’s SOL and the Tron network’s native token TRON posted 3%-5% gains, outperforming the broader digital asset market. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was down 0.5%.  What does the government shutdown mean for crypto  “The oppressive macro uncertainty is still a major headwind,” Noelle Acheson, macro analyst and author of Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, noted Friday. “Bond markets around the world are flashing signs of distress, as yields have reached multi-year records in the US, UK, Germany and Japan to name just a few markets.”  She added that the looming U.S. government shutdown adds to the uncertainty and noted that the U.S. consumer spending growth in Q2 was revised lower, an indication that consumers might not be that resilient to tightening financial conditions.  “As scary as this may sound, during the 21 government shutdowns [in the past] the S&P 500 rose 55% of the time, generating an average return of 0.3%,” advisory firm Asgard Markets wrote in a Friday market report.  Digital asset investment firm NYDIG said that the government shutdown could delay regulatory decisions, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff will be radically reduced.  “A spot bitcoin ETF will have to wait until after SEC employees come back from a potential furlough,” Greg Cipolaro, NYDIG’s head of research, wrote in the report.  What’s next for bitcoin's (BTC) price?  Still, crypto markets held up well recently compared to the sell-off in stocks. Despite the difficult macro picture, Asgard has a more constructive outlook for risk assets in Q4.  “BTC and ETH are now trying to break upwards outside of their range established in the last month and a half,” Asgard said. “We are looking for a short-term move somewhere between $28,500 and a swipe of $30,000, for as long as BTC does not retrace below 26,000.”  Historically, October has usually been a bullish month for bitcoin, Markus Thielen, Matrixport’s Head of Research said in a recent appearance on CoinDesk TV.  He pointed out that ""over the last 10 years, eight of those times in October, the market was actually up with an average of 22%,"" adding that as soon as interest rates become dovish bitcoin is “going to break out quite aggressively.”  Thielen also argued that bitcoin miners, particularly Marathon Digital, are entering this next quarter with far more efficient operations.  At the same time, the halving is still on everyone’s minds: Marathon Digital, according to Thielen, estimated their mining costs would increase from $24,000 to $29,000 per bitcoin.  “Nevertheless, we need to really rally above 30,000,” he concluded.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Krisztian Sandor, Sam Reynolds",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/29/bitcoins-slips-below-27k-but-what-might-government-shutdown-mean-for-prices,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68aa81b5c6375825b5c052ae633df0c86c34b11c-2630x1522.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18188537,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553568,1696010436,Bitcoin Eyes Turnaround: Could A New All-Time High Be On The Horizon? Analyst Predicts,"Crypto Rover, a seasoned cryptocurrency trader and analyst, has recently shared insights suggesting that Bitcoin’s current trajectory may change. Based on the latest technical analysis, Bitcoin might soon paint a brighter, bullish picture. Bitcoin Break From The Bearish Shackles In his recent analysis, Crypto Rover explained Bitcoin’s price action shift. It’s been noted that the leading crypto is making headway in breaking a longstanding negative trend that has persisted for 77 days. This shift marks a monumental moment for Bitcoin, which had been entrapped in bearish confines for a considerable duration. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Hidden Threat? Miner Revenue Sent To Exchanges Surges Over 300% Crypto Rover’s assertions are not without merit. The analyst anticipates a more concrete bullish reversal if BTC sustains a break above the $27,200 mark. It is worth noting that the achievement of such a feat could give traders and investors the confidence to venture deeper into BTC, given the positive momentum. Beyond this threshold, Rover further disclosed that a breach above the $31,000 level would serve as an “unmistakably” bullish beacon, potentially propelling Bitcoin to scale new all-time highs. In a broader context, BTC seems to be making efforts to break free from its bearish constraints. While its price has mostly ranged between $26,000 and $27,000 zone over the past week, its market capitalization has notably increased by more than $5 billion. BTC’s 4-hour chart suggests it’s in a consolidation phase. This could indicate that the top crypto may be bracing for a significant move, as such phases often signal that the market makers are determining the next potential price trajectory. Bitcoin is priced at $26,844, witnessing a nearly 1% drop over the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour trading volume is $15.5 billion, a considerable uptick from the $9.9 billion seen just last Friday. Anticipation Of Regulatory Winds Of Change Furthermore, it’s not only the charts that dictate the potential bullish swing for Bitcoin. An undercurrent of fundamental factors plays into this optimistic outlook as well. At the core of this optimism is the anticipation surrounding the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and their forthcoming decisions on Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications. Recently, the SEC deferred its decision on the BTC spot ETF application from Blackrock, one of the world’s leading fund managers. However, Crypto Rover believes that this approval, when it comes, could set off a “domino effect.” Related Reading: Bitcoin In Spotlight: Robert Kiyosaki Questions BTC’s Future Amid Citibank’s Blockchain Play According to the analyst, should Blackrock gain the coveted SEC nod, it may pave the way for subsequent approvals for other major institutional players. Such a sequence of green lights could fuel a substantial BTC rally, further solidifying its bullish stance.

Sharks & Whales Are Accumulating Both Bitcoin, Tether Right Now According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, both the sharks and whales of BTC and USDT have been accumulating recently. The metric of interest here is the “Supply Distribution,” which keeps track of the total amount of a given asset that the different holder groups carry. In the current topic, sharks and whales are the entities of interest. For Bitcoin, the combined supply of these assets may be defined as the 10 to 10,000 BTC range, while for Tether, it’s generally 100,000 to 10 million USDT. The sharks and whales are influential entities in the sector due to their holdings, but their role differs between whether they are holding the volatile BTC or the stablecoin USDT. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surge Above $27,000 May Not Last, Here’s Why The chart below shows how the supplies of the sharks and whales of the two cryptocurrencies have changed over the last few months: Both of these metrics appear to have registered an increase during the past few days | Source: Santiment on X The graph shows that the Bitcoin sharks and whales have participated in some accumulation recently, which has taken their supply to 13.03 million BTC, a new high for the year. Interestingly, while this accumulation has occurred, the sharks and whales of Tether have also expanded their holdings. The metric’s value, in this case, has reached a six-week high of 15.03 billion USDT. The significance of the trend in the supply of the BTC sharks and whales may seem straightforward: these humongous entities are buying right now, so that should be bullish for the price. But what about the pattern being shown by the USDT cohort? Generally, an investor may buy into a stablecoin like USDT to avoid the volatility of assets like Bitcoin. Once these holders feel that the prices are right to jump back into the volatile side of the sector, they exchange their fiat-tied tokens for their desired coin. This shift can naturally provide buying pressure on whatever cryptocurrency they are swapping into. Because of this reason, one way to look at the supply of a stablecoin is as a measure of the available potential buying power for Bitcoin and other assets in the market. Thus, the latest Tether accumulation would suggest that the sharks and whales have increased their buying capacity. Sometimes, spikes in this indicator come at the expense of the corresponding BTC metric, as these holders convert their reserves. While the buying power goes up for the future in such a scenario, it has only come at the expense of a BTC selloff. Related Reading: Research Firm Reveals Its “Altcoin Trading Playbook” In the current case, though, both of these indicators have trended up at the same time, which means that not only have the sharks and whales participated in some Bitcoin shopping, but the capital reserves that these large holders may deploy into the asset in the form of Tether have also gone up. “This is generally a bullish combination,” explains Santiment. BTC Price Bitcoin had earlier risen above the $27,000 level, but the asset has retreated in the past few hours as it is now trading around the $26,700 mark.

This has led to a rare green day for the cryptocurrency market in as many months but MATIC may not be able to hold as well as other altcoins as whales make their move. Whales Move Tens Of Millions To Exchanges The first notable whale transaction involving MATIC was flagged by Lookonchain on Wednesday. The transaction was carrying 10.78 million tokens at the time worth around $5.5 million. Related Reading: IPO Frenzy: What Happens To XRP Price If Ripple Stock Climbs To $600? Mostly, it was the destination of these tokens that was important which turned out to be the Binance crypto exchange. The whale looked to have deposited the tokens to sell them as the MATIC price had taken a quick 3% dive following the deposit. A whale deposited a total of 10.78M $MATIC ($5.5M) into #Binance in the past 26 hours and the price of $MATIC decreased by 3%. The whale currently has 2.72M $MATIC($1.37M) left.https://t.co/C4VNQ1QDq9 pic.twitter.com/8JcoySfsRP — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 27, 2023 MATIC would later recover and move into the green, a price increase that seemed to have prompted more whales to take advantage of the situation. Over the course of the day, whale transaction tracker Whale Alert would report multiple whale transactions all carrying millions of dollars worth of the token toward exchanges. The next large transaction was one carrying 11,000,888 tokens worth $5.7 million to the Binance exchange. Another transaction followed shortly carrying the exact number of MATIC tokens also headed for the Binance exchange. Within the same hour, the whale tracker also reported 15,826,267 million MATIC being shifted once again to Binance. This transition was carrying approximately $8.2 million worth of tokens. This pointed toward whales looking to dump large portions of holdings. 🚨 15,826,267 #MATIC (8,199,632 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Binancehttps://t.co/fgGpVb7id0 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) September 28, 2023 MATIC price resting at $0.52 | Source: MATICUSD on Tradingview.com MATIC Price Could Suffer Drawdown The massive amounts of tokens being shifted toward centralized exchanges could mean that the whales are beginning to offload some of their holdings to avoid further losses. In this case, it is not farfetched to say that the altcoin’s rally over the last day might be a brief one. Such a fall could easily see the MATIC price fall back to $0.51 as bears retest the support at $0.5. Related Reading: Analyst Presents 4 Charts That Prove Crypto Is Not Dead However, all hope is not lost for the MATIC price as the coin still holds some bullishness. As one TradingView analyst points out, if the altcoin is able to break out from its current descending triangle, then the price could rally over 50%. MATIC could see an upside to $0.9 | Source: Tradingview.com The analyst puts the first target of this rally at the $0.9 level as well, which is an almost 100% price increase from here. But MATIC will continue to face opposition from bears, making it a tricky situation. At the time of writing, the MATIC price is resting above $0.5232, enjoying 3.06% gains in the last day.

18184051,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553556,1695999654,MakerDAO Secures $6 Billion For Treasury Bill Investments As MKR Dominates 2023,"According to a Bloomberg report, MakerDAO, one of the prominent decentralized lenders in cryptocurrency, has reaffirmed its decision to invest billions of dollars in US government bonds. This strategic move has propelled its governance coin, MKR, to reach its highest level since April 2022, outperforming other major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC). MKR has experienced a remarkable surge of 77% this quarter, emerging as the best-performing cryptocurrency of the year. Despite a modest decline of 3.9% to $1,452 on Friday, the coin has nearly tripled in value. MakerDAO Doubles Down On Treasury Bonds As per DefiLlama data, MakerDAO currently oversees $4.6 billion in assets. The rally of MKR can be attributed to MakerDAO’s 2022 decision to convert the backing funds of its stablecoin DAI into assets such as short-term US Treasuries and corporate bonds. Related Reading: Bitcoin News: BTC Price Drops To $2,700 On Binance, CZ Explains Why This strategic shift aimed to seek more stable yields amid the downturn in the cryptocurrency markets. Subsequently, MakerDAO passed a proposal enabling the investment of up to $6 billion in short-term Treasuries, doubling the existing limit. Simon Peters, an analyst at investment platform eToro, suggests that the recent gains in MKR can be attributed to rising treasury yields following the Federal Reserve’s indication of keeping rates higher for longer. However, signs of a potential slowdown in the MKR rally have emerged. CryptoQuant data reveals a gradual increase in MKR tokens held on centralized exchanges (CEX), indicating that some traders are preparing to secure profits from the recent surge. Notably, the drop experienced on September 29 ahead of the monthly close marked the largest decline since mid-September. According to Bloomberg, the trader enthusiasm for MKR has extended to DAI, MakerDAO’s stablecoin. DAI’s circulation has grown from a low of $3.9 billion on August 20 to $5.5 billion. Furthermore, MakerDAO introduced a limited-time offer of an 8% annual yield to DAI holders, which, combined with the approval of the investment proposal, could potentially trigger a fresh wave of buying in short-term Treasuries. Allan Pedersen, the CEO of Monetalis, a firm assisting MakerDAO in its investments, expressed that if the supply of DAI continues to increase, it could lead to a significant expansion of MakerDAO’s T-bill investments in a short time frame. The developments surrounding MakerDAO’s investment strategy in US government bonds, which have propelled MKR to new heights, signify a calculated move to achieve stability and sustainable yields by the decentralized protocol. MKR Hits 18-Month High MKR has declined over 4.5% in the past 24 hours, causing the token to retrace to its current trading price of $1,452. However, over the last month, MKR has exhibited consistent gains across various time frames, with notable increases of 12%, 19%, and nearly 40% over the seven, fourteen, and thirty-day periods, respectively. Related Reading: Important Events That Could Have A Massive Impact On XRP Price Furthermore, MKR has reached an impressive 18-month high, surging by 101% year to date and briefly peaking at $1,590 earlier on Friday. In the short term, safeguarding against an extended decline, MKR has two crucial support levels that bulls must defend. The first immediate support rests at $1,430, while the second support level, spanning two months, is positioned at $1,341. Meanwhile, MakerDAO and its ecosystem appear poised for further gains with their investment strategy. With a few months remaining in 2023, there is a potential for MKR to conclude the year as the top-performing asset if the ongoing rally continues.

42409619,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcM7JQ,1695999621,Where Liquid Staking Meets Tokenization,"Liquid staking has the potential to be the building blocks that incorporate established financial norms into crypto that mainstream audiences actually trust. This is because staking resembles traditional financial (TradFi) instruments they're already familiar with, like bonds, in terms of yield opportunities and risk profile.  Liquid staking will be a catalyst to the broader mainstream adoption and market stability, which remain key objectives for the crypto ecosystem.  Danny Chong is a co-founder of Tranchess.  The power of familiarity  To understand the significance of liquid staking as a familiar comfort blanket for non-crypto-natives, it’s important to understand how it works. Liquid staking refers to the process of locking up cryptocurrency assets to support blockchain network operation while offering a level of stability and familiarity similar to conventional financial instruments. It can be seen as a more advanced form of traditional staking where users can use their locked funds for other on-chain activities while still earning rewards from their original deposits.  In the financial landscape, both liquid staking tokens and government bonds in traditional finance bear the similarity in that they serve as investment vehicles that offer a form of yield or interest over time. In the case of liquid staking tokens, users earn staking rewards, while government bonds offer periodic interest payments. Furthermore, both liquid staking tokens and certain types of government bonds can be readily traded in secondary markets, providing liquidity to investors.  Cryptocurrency investments carry high-risk profiles, which have deterred many investors from entering the space. Liquid staking mirrors government bonds in the sense that both of these instruments are often considered lower risk compared to other investment options in their respective markets. This is particularly important as it makes liquid staking a compelling alternative for risk-averse investors seeking more stability. Therefore, the ability of liquid staking to offer a risk profile that is familiar to a low-risk traditional investment instrument is a noteworthy advantage.  By merging the benefits of staking with the familiarity of traditional finance, liquid staking appeals to mainstream investors and a broader audience, reducing barriers to entry and encouraging wider adoption.  Unlocking the potential of liquid staking  Liquid staking isn't just about staking assets and earning rewards. It represents an opportunity in the cryptocurrency landscape to unlock the potential of enhancing the overall financial ecosystem.  See also: Staking Risks Are Vastly Misunderstood | Opinion  Yield from liquid staking has the potential to form the base of structured products in the coming future due to its stable reward system. Compared to the price volatility of underlying cryptocurrencies, liquid staking rewards are relatively stable and predictable, making them a reliable source of cash flow to create structured products. For example, a financial institution may develop a yield-enhanced product that offers investors a higher yield by combining staking rewards with other income-generating strategies.  Likewise, financial derivatives can also be structured based on the expected yield from staking. These derivatives may allow investors to speculate on future staking rewards or to use the expected yield to purchase yield-enhancing structured products. While tokenization is an integral aspect of liquid staking, it isn't the sole focus of its innovation.  With liquid staking, ""staking deposits"" become a digital token that users can trade or sell. This means users have more control over how they use staked assets, like selling them if they need liquidity or swapping them for other digital assets. This flexibility and predictability make it easier to manage assets and make investments.  With improved transparency, reduced counterparty risk and decentralized control, liquid staking unlocks new possibilities for yield generation and empowers financial users.  The path towards mainstream trust and adoption  Liquid staking's promise lies in its ability to mimic the financial instruments that mainstream audiences are comfortable with, fostering wider adoption and reducing barriers to entry. This will introduce an influx of new participants that will fuel further expansion and diversification within the crypto market",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Danny Chong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/29/where-liquid-staking-meets-tokenization,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd9379a8e27238a21ad4086f56c3d7ede60cdc07-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409613,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcM72t,1695997415,Opposing Centralization in Ethereum Staking,"The market has agreed that staking is a really good deal — more so than core developers ever anticipated. There’s not just demand to build on Ethereum, but a wildly unanticipated demand to participate in Ethereum’s consensus, aka staking.  Stakers put down collateral in the form of ETH to validate the network and receive rewards in the form of ETH. Yield is dependent on the size of the validator set, which, in theory, creates a market equilibrium — if yield is too low, people unstake. If the validator set is too small, yield increases and new stakers are incentivized to enter the set.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Staking Week."" Nixo.eth is the executive director at EthStaker.  In the purest form of staking, affectionately called “home staking,”you run a small, unobtrusive, energy-efficient PC with Ethereum software and you control your assets. But there are two cohorts who want to stake but don’t want to “home stake.” The first set is people who don’t have the motivation, time or tech savvy to learn how to set up the necessary PC. The second set is people who don’t want to lock up their ETH for a ~3%-6% yield – they’re interested in more risk and more reward.  These two cohorts have given rise to a part of the ecosystem that is both a boon and a bane. They allow their stake to be managed by a third party who gives them receipt tokens, which means that this third party doesn’t have anything ""at stake"" but still retains some influence over the network. It provides a service and takes a cut of the rewards.  On the one hand, third parties democratize access to staking. The barrier to stake is quite high in terms of initial investment and tech knowledge, and ""staking-as-a-service"" providers make on-boarding easy. They are are a net positive for the chain.  On the other hand, third parties, or in other words middlemen, the types of market participants that crypto is meant to eliminate, come with problems.  Ethereum’s Shanghai hardfork in April enabled people who had been staking for years to finally withdraw. It was a massive derisking event for those interested in staking. Since then, the queue to get into staking has been several weeks to months long. The metaphorical bouncer has not had a moment’s rest.  Everybody is piling into staking and few are leaving, putting network stability and centralization risks at the forefront of the minds working in core development.  The boom in staking coupled with centralization issues of third-party providers has created somewhat of a villain narrative in the staking ecosystem. And one third-party staking provider has eclipsed all others: Lido. Lido is a semi-decentralized, non-custodial staking protocol that anybody can use to stake their ETH that is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  There are two sides to the debate — Lido is a successful business with attractive UX [user experience] and solid business development. It’s acting as an economically rational actor by seeking to control a large portion of all staked ETH and is stress-testing the limits of Ethereum’s protocol design. Plus, it’s not just one entity, it’s 38 operators.  See also: Does Lido Control Too Much Liquid Staking?  The other side would say that Lido is detrimental to the decentralization of the chain, because it refuses to artificially cap its staking dominance and that its rapid monopolistic growth is uncooperative with researchers while they figure out a ""coded in"" way to deal with the design flaw that has allowed a single entity to grow to manage one-third of all staked ETH. Further, those 38 operators are still managed by one entity: the Lido DAO, where decisions are usually made by just two wallets.  Lido is exploiting a flaw that threatens the core value proposition of Ethereum: its decentralization and inability to bend to any special interests.  In any case, the move here is to give Ethereum researchers more time to discuss, brainstorm and adapt the system to account for these economically rational actors. Core development and research are accomplished in uncharted territory with hundreds of the best minds in tech who now grapple with this centralization risk and how to mitigate or even actively account for it.  There are already ideas being discussed and the community is working hard to inform individuals and institutions of risks that might not be apparent when they choose their staking provider. I, for one, expect that the caliber of solution we’ll see will match that which we’ve come to know from Ethereum core development.

18182664,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553501,1695996030,"Bitcoin Surge Above $27,000 May Not Last, Here’s Why","Bitcoin has broken back above the $27,000 level during the past day, but if on-chain data is to go by, this surge may not last for long. Bitcoin Investors Are Taking Profits At Highest Rate In 3 Months According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, there is a chance that a short-term correction could happen for the cryptocurrency. The relevant metric here is the “ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss,” which, as its name suggests, tells us about how the profit-taking volume compares against the loss-taking volume on the Bitcoin network right now. This indicator works by going through the transaction history of each coin being sold/transferred on the blockchain to see what price it was moved at before. If this previous selling price for any coin was less than the current spot price, then that coin is being sold at a profit right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Long-Term Holders Deposit To Exchanges The sale of all such tokens would contribute toward the Bitcoin profit-taking volume, while coins of the opposite type would add towards the loss-taking volume. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this BTC metric over the past few months: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, this Bitcoin indicator has observed a large spike as the cryptocurrency’s price itself has seen a surge beyond the $27,000 mark and has reached a value of 2.51. When the metric has a value greater than zero, it means that the profit-taking volume is more than the loss-taking volume. On the other hand, values under this threshold suggest the dominance of loss-taking. At the current value of 2.51, the profit-taking volume outweighs the loss-taking one by 3.51 to 1. This disparity between these two volumes is the highest it has been since around three months ago. Historically, intense profit-taking has usually resulted in at least a short-term top for Bitcoin, so it’s possible that the current values of the metric would also result in a correction for the price. In the chart, Santiment has also attached the data for the “Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio,” which keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin market cap and realized cap. The latter of these is basically a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the cryptocurrency, so this metric tells us how the value that the holders are carrying currently compares with their total investment. Related Reading: Research Firm Reveals Its “Altcoin Trading Playbook” From the graph, it’s visible that the 7-day Bitcoin MVRV ratio has turned notably positive with this rise, which implies that the investors are carrying profits at the moment. The analytics firm notes that this metric going back below zero would be ideal for the next leg up, as the holders being in loss would lead to an exhaustion of the profit-sellers. BTC Price So far, despite the aggressive profit-taking happening in the market, Bitcoin has managed to hold above the $27,000 mark.

42409634,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcM80P,1695993020,First Mover Americas: Circle Argues Stablecoins Aren’t Securities in Response to SEC’s Binance Lawsuit,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Stablecoin issuer Circle has intervened in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s case against major crypto exchange Binance, arguing that financial trading laws shouldn’t spread to stablecoins whose value is tied to other assets. In June, regulators charged Binance with multiple legal violations for facilitating trades in cryptocurrencies, such as Solana's SOL, Cardano's ADA and the Binance stablecoin BUSD, which the SEC alleged constituted unregistered securities. That’s become one of the most major cases in crypto right now, as the world’s biggest crypto exchange – alongside rivals like Coinbase – seek to argue that crypto isn’t caught by existing heavy-handed U.S. financial laws.  Asset manager Valkyrie started buying ether (ETH) futures contracts, after getting approval to convert its existing bitcoin futures exchange traded fund (ETF) to a two-for-one investment vehicle. ""Today, the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (Nasdaq: $BTF) began adding exposure to Ether futures contracts, making it the first U.S. ETF to provide exposure to Ether and Bitcoin futures contracts under one wrapper,"" a spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email statement. Valkyrie was first to get approval for ETH futures ETF among other firms, as it ""supplemented its prospectus and updated risk disclosures related to Ether futures,"" said the spokesperson.  Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) announced this week that it had received regulatory approval in Bermuda to list perpetual futures to users outside of the United States. The move comes as no surprise, after Coinbase acquired a license in Bermuda to operate a spot exchange back in April following a gung-ho approach from U.S. regulators, with the ultimate intention of rolling out a perpetual futures platform. Perpetual futures are a type of cash-settled derivatives contract that allow traders to ""long"" or ""short"" an underlying asset with leverage. Instead of the contract expiring every month or quarter, perpetual swap traders pay a funding rate that represents the difference between the mark and index price of the underlying asset, this ensures that pricing stays efficient.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows that addresses holding at least 0.1% of bitcoin's supply have recorded strong net inflows throughout Q3.  When bitcoin dropped to $25,000 large holders saw inflows of $600 million within a day.  Since then bitcoin has seen three other spikes of $400 million + in net inflows to large holders, showing strong interest quietly building up, according to IntoTheBlock. ""These have happened while centralized exchanges have seen outflows, suggesting it is organic buyers receiving these funds and not just CEX addresses,"" said IntoTheBlock.

18181249,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553520,1695992452,Important Events That Could Have A Massive Impact On XRP Price,"Despite some analysts noting why XRP is unlikely to end on a high, certain macro (and micro) factors could significantly impact the token’s price and possibly see it enjoy the same trajectory it did following Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling in favor of Ripple. SEC-Related Factors Could Impact XRP Price On August 17, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was given approval by Judge Analisa Torres to file its motion seeking an interlocutory appeal against her ruling at the Court of Appeals. Related Reading: IPO Frenzy: What Happens To XRP Price If Ripple Stock Climbs To $600? However, this wasn’t an approval of the SEC’s appeal, and that is something that everyone in the XRP community is currently anticipating, as the court can either choose to accept or reject the appeal after considering the grounds for appeal and whether it meets the requirements needed to allow it. As a former SEC official Marc Fogel noted, the specific requirements for an interlocutory appeal are “hard to meet,” and the odds seem to be against the SEC. As such, the court is expected to deny the SEC’s request for an interlocutory appeal. If that happens, we could see XRP again enjoy most of the gains it saw following Judge Torres’ ruling when the token’s market cap rose significantly, overtaking Binance’s BNB to become the fourth-largest crypto by market cap (although it has dropped back to 5th). Another factor that could spark an upward trend for XRP is if a settlement between Ripple and the SEC becomes more feasible. Stakeholders in the crypto community have commented on the possibility of this happening and factors that could prompt both parties to settle. Pro-XRP legal expert John Deaton once stated that a settlement could happen this year if Judge Failla granted Coinbase’s motion to dismiss the SEC’s lawsuit against it. If that were to happen, the Judge would likely be adopting Judge Torres’ ruling that programmatic sales do not constitute investment contracts and crypto tokens bought through exchanges cannot be labeled as one. It is believed that this could force the SEC into settling as it will become more established (especially if its interlocutory appeal was rejected alongside) that it doesn’t have jurisdiction over token sales on exchanges as they do not constitute investment contracts. Related Reading: Analyst Presents 4 Charts That Prove Crypto Is Not Dead A more interesting factor that could force the SEC into a settlement is the revelations (and future ones) being made about the ETH Gate. As a form of damage control, the Commission could propose a settlement with Ripple rather than dragging the case to trial, where its credibility could be jeopardized. The SEC proposing a settlement (not necessarily in the public eye) will be considered a major win for Ripple. It could restore investors’ confidence in the ecosystem, leading to a price increase in the XRP token. XRP continues the recovery trend to rest above $0.51 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Ripple’s Expansion Plans Ripple has proven not to be deterred by the long-running battle against the SEC as the crypto firm has continued to build amidst it. In fact, the company’s President, Monica Lang, recently mentioned that the court case (following Judge Torres’ ruling) has helped them to expand their business not just in the US but “even more globally.” According to her, the ruling gave the company much-needed clarity, especially amid regulatory uncertainty. With this in mind, the company can map out a proper framework going forward, bearing in mind that Judge Torres had ruled that XRP isn’t a security in itself. On the back of Judge Torres’ ruling, Ripple’s general counsel Stuart Alderoty had revealed to CNBC in an interview that Ripple could potentially begin talks with US financial firms about them adopting Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, which can be used to facilitate cross-border transactions. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Addresses Bitcoin Adviser’s Claims That XRP Is Centralized If this were to happen, it would undoubtedly represent a bullish signal for the XRP community. Although Ripple and XRP have enjoyed outstanding success overseas (especially in Asia), many still believe that more work needs to be done to penetrate the American market. Therefore, a move like that could convince investors of the great strides the company is making in America. Meanwhile, there are also rumors of Ripple going public. Ripple is set to hold its “proper victory party” on September 29 in New York, and many in the XRP community speculate that the crypto firm could announce its initial public offering (IPO) plans at the event. Such an announcement will be huge and could generate more buzz and interest in the company, with XRP’s price being a beneficiary of this news. XRP is currently trading at $0.50, up by close to 2% in the last twenty-four hours as anticipation towards the party builds up.

The offering is accessible to individual accredited investors, regulated institutions, companies, funds and decentralized autonomous organizations, according to the firm’s press release. Third-party distributors can also integrate OpenTrade’s pool and power their own white-labeled yield offering.  OpenTrade’s initial distribution partners, direct lenders and liquidity providers include Enigma Securities, WOO X, Resonate, Kyber Network and Sino Global Capital. UK-based structured finance firm Five Sigma provides support for off-chain operations.  The offering comes as placing traditional financial instruments such as government bonds, private equity or credit to blockchain – often referred to tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) – has become one of the hottest trends in crypto, with big banks exploring ways to leverage blockchain technology.  U.S. Treasuries are considered as a gateway for tokenization efforts given their high yield and low-risk status. The tokenized treasuries market has grown sixfold this year to $668 million, with asset management firm Franklin Templeton being the biggest player, according to data by rwa.xyz.  OpenTrade’s tokenized Treasuries pool was developed using Circle’s Perimeter Protocol, an open-source codebase for on-chain credit facilitation, and is powered by the USDC stablecoin.  Following the U.S. Treasury pool, OpenTrade has plans to introduce a variety of on-chain yield products including investment-grade commercial paper and supply chain financing, founders Dave Sutter and Jeff Handler told CoinDesk in an interview earlier this week.  The opportunity for trade financing using blockchain rails is particularly attractive, they explained, as there’s a $2.5 trillion unmet financing demand from market participants, according to a report by the Asian Development Bank.

Shocking Bitcoin News For Traders On Binance According to crypto report Colin Wu, the price of Bitcoin crashed on the trading venue from its current levels to as low as $2,700. As seen on the chart below, and unlike previous occasions, the crash took place on different occasions. The incident was recorded at 16:17 UTC+8 time on the crypto exchange’s perpetual futures platform. One of the most popular trading instruments on the crypto exchange, its CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, responded to the incident. Via his personal X account, CZ said: Root cause identified, some new code caused it. Need to revert and fix data. Engineers say 1hr ETA for fix. So, expect 2hr or so.

A pseudonym crypto analyst claims that the cryptocurrency remains below the 20-day moving average and 21-day exponential moving average. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today? Insights From Leading Analysts If the cryptocurrency can reclaim this territory, then bulls could have a shot of returning above $30,000. Looking at potential clues that could hint at further profits, the analyst said: Bitcoin Open Interest came down a lot as price held steady. I said it yesterday but I’ll say it again, it’s looking a lot healthier than any prior dumps. This does not mean this can’t go down obviously. It does make it less likely to see these volatile up and down moves.

18179506,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553496,1695987938,Major Shiba Inu News Coming? Kusama Wants ‘To End Silence Soon’,"In a whirlwind of anticipation, the Shiba Inu community is holding its collective breath as Shytoshi Kusama, the chief architect behind SHIB, hints at breaking his silence. With a slew of developments on the horizon for the Shiba Inu project, the statement amplifies expectations for potential significant updates. In a message conveyed by team member Lucie on Twitter, Kusama emphasized his unwavering support for the Shiba Inu community, stating, “We FULLY intend to support the community. Hence the paper. Takes time, that’s all. But I think it’s time for my silence to end SOON.” This announcement has fueled heightened expectations and excitement for what’s next for the Shiba Inu project. Potential Shiba Inu News The Shiba Inu project has been the subject of much discussion recently, especially with recent alterations and announcements. A few days ago, there was a notable transformation of BONE, Shibarium’s gas token. The process, termed “renouncing,” ensures that BONE has now become fully decentralized, thereby eliminating any chance for future alterations or manipulations by the contract owner. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Update: 530% Spike In Shibarium Metric Could Trigger SHIB Recovery Kaal Dhairya, a prominent developer within the Shiba Inu community, took to X (previously known as Twitter) to affirm this significant shift. He remarked, “The deed is done, BONE is now renounced via the TopDog contract. We will continue to build decentralized, permissionless systems for the benefit of the community.” Furthermore, on the dawn of September, Lucie, who holds the mantle of Shiba Inu’s Marketing Officer, pulled back the curtains on the unveiling of Wrapped BONE. WBONE has been introduced as a Shibarium-based token. It offers a standardized representation of the BONE token, ensuring its compatibility with the diverse ecosystem of smart contracts and DApps on the Shibarium network. So, what developments can be anticipated next? Speculation runs rife on the next potential move for Shiba Inu. ShibaSwap’s transition to Shibarium has been a hot topic since Kusama’s last update in August, where he hinted at the move happening “soon”. However, an echoing silence has surrounded ShibaSwap’s migration progress since then. However, the Shibarium project is more than just ShibaSwap and there’s a broader vision. The SHIB team has pledged to transition all Shiba Inu-linked ventures to the state-of-the-art Shibarium platform. This migration includes captivating offerings like non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Moreover, eyes are keenly set on “Shib: The Metaverse” – a metaverse product that has been in the wings for some time without any fresh updates as of lately. SHIB Price Poised For Massive Rally? In recent days, the Shiba Inu price has shown a slight uptrend. However, the 4-hour chart shows that the bulls need to show much more buying power to break out of the sideways trend of the last three-plus weeks. Today, the SHIB price was rejected at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.00000742. Related Reading: Shiba Inu At $0.0000072: Sellers Push For Breakout From Compact Zone In order to build more bullish momentum in the smaller time frames, it is essential for SHIB to break through this resistance. As of now, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000753 and the September 23 local high at $0.00000770 are key price targets. If SHIB can build bullish momentum on the smaller time frames, this could also suggest that SHIB bulls are winning the battle on the higher time frames where a bullish quadruple bottom or a descending triangle is looming (1-week chart). As explained in previous analyses, both patterns are still too similar to make a final judgment at the moment. If the quadruple bottom bottom—a noteworthy pattern in technical analysis—is validated, SHIB could be poised for a substantial rally. Market participants would be wise to observe the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level closely, situated at $0.00002545, which could signify an approximate surge of 250% from its current standing. However, the bullish scenario depicted by the quadruple bottom is juxtaposed by the contrasting bearish implications of the descending triangle. A breach below the support level of $0.00000715 could corroborate the descending triangle pattern, likely thrusting SHIB toward a low of $0.000006 for the year. Such a breach may lead SHIB into unknown territory, with the prospect of establishing a new all-time low becoming a stark possibility.

Previous government shutdowns had little impact on Bitcoin's price. The 2023 banking crisis may be a better comparison, but Bitcoin's price dropped during times of uncertainty. Some analysts and experts are predicting a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rally in case a US government shutdown happens on the 1st of October. In this article, I will try to analyze if this would be a logical thing happening, based on past reactions of the Bitcoin price to other shutdowns and to the 2023 banking crisis. Government shutdown approaching Unless US Congress reaches an agreement soon, the government is headed toward a shutdown from the 1st of October, which is already this Sunday. I will not talk politics in this article, since this is a financial analysis about cryptocurrency. I will only look at the effects this shutdown might have. Usually, financial markets do not like government shutdowns. It must first be said that on the long term, government shutdowns have no measurable effect on the performance of stock markets (and likely also of cryptocurrency). But on the short term, uncertainty leads to volatility. The government shutdown that started in December 2018 was even accompanied by drops in the stock market of almost 20%. Let us take a look at the price development of Bitcoin during the previous government shutdowns. There are only three government shutdowns during which Bitcoin already existed, so there's not a whole lot of data here. Data by YCharts Graph 1: Bitcoin price (logarithmic) over the last 10 years (2013 is not listed since the data do not go back this far). Dates of shutdown Price change of Bitcoin during the shutdown 1 - 16 October 2013 +7.8% 20 - 23 January 2018 -15.7% 22 December 2018 - 25 January 2019 -9.8% Table 1: Performance of Bitcoin during government shutdowns (source: calculated by author) For the 2013 shutdown, during which Bitcoin gained almost 8%, it should be noted that Bitcoin was still relatively unknown during this time, and people especially did not view it as a safe harbor in case of financial turmoil. Also, after this shutdown, at the end of 2013, Bitcoin skyrocketed from levels around $200 to high of more than $1,200, so compared to this, the price change during the shutdown was quite insignificant. In the beginning of 2018, Bitcoin just came off from then all-time highs of more than $12,000 (see graph 1), which likely explains the bulk of the more than 15% drop. For the longest shutdown on our list, from December 2018 to January 2019, Bitcoin price dropped by almost 10%. As we can see on graph 2, the response of the S&P 500 ( SPY ) to the government shutdown is clearly visible, while Bitcoin's main drop happened before this (when the stock markets obviously did not yet view a potential government shutdown as a danger). The almost 10% drop of Bitcoin during the shutdown seems insignificant compared to the almost 50% crash in November 2018, which makes it more likely that the behavior of Bitcoin during this shutdown was just 'regular' volatility. Data by YCharts Graph 2: Bitcoin and S&P 500 prices between November 2018 and February 2019. So for previous government shutdowns, it seems unlikely that Bitcoin's price dropped or gained because of these events. Parallels between the 2023 banking crisis The 2023 US banking crisis is mentioned by some as a better comparison, since it happened more recently. Also, during the last couple of years, Bitcoin has increasingly been viewed as a safe haven by some investors. Let us take a look and see if the banking crisis which happened in the beginning of this year is a better comparison. Data by YCharts Graph 3: Bitcoin price during 2023. The banking crisis started at the 8th of March and ended around the end of April this year. After rising quickly in the first months of 2023, Bitcoin price reached a value of just above $20,000 on the 10th of March, after which it rose to more than $30,000 about a month later. This was a strong rise of 50%, but did it happen because the market saw cryptocurrency as a safe destination of capital? Data by YCharts Graph 4: Bitcoin price during March 2023. If we look closer and zoom in using graph 4, we can see that between March 8-10, when the Silicon Valley Bank run happened, Bitcoin price dropped. After the bank was seized on March 10, prices stabilized. Only after broad measures including a backstop from the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury Department on March 12, Bitcoin price started to rise again. Data by YCharts Graph 5: Bitcoin price during the last year compared with Invesco KBW Bank ETF ( KBWB ). Also, as we can see in graph 5, while the banking sector was hit hard and did not recover yet, Bitcoin price experienced some strong performance since then. I can draw a couple of conclusions from these graphs and events: Like most other financial assets, Bitcoin price dropped when uncertainty was at its highest, during the bank run Bitcoin has recovered quickly and sharply after the 2023 banking crisis Banks were hit hard while Bitcoin, being seen as an alternative to traditional banking, performed well Still, given Bitcoin's price volatility, it remains difficult to estimate how large the real effect of the banking crisis on the price of Bitcoin was What to expect from Bitcoin during a shutdown? As we tried to analyze earlier in this article, during previous government shutdowns, Bitcoin seemed to be influenced more by other sources of volatility than by volatility stemming from these shutdowns. Therefore, the 2023 banking crisis might be a better comparison. However, when we zoomed in on the events leading up to the banking crisis of earlier this year, we discovered that during times of uncertainty, Bitcoin price dropped. It was only after the largest uncertainties were covered that Bitcoin's price rallied. For this reason, I believe a government shutdown will not lead to a rally in Bitcoin price. Also, in the case of the banking crisis, it is likely that some investors regarded Bitcoin as an alternative to the traditional banking system. This might explain its strong rally between March and April this year. I think a government shutdown will not have the same effect on Bitcoin as the banking crisis. While Bitcoin and the contemporary banking system can be viewed as alternatives, this is not the case for a government shutdown. Long-term perspective On the short term, Bitcoin will remain a relatively volatile asset. Since its nascence, Bitcoin seems to have acted more as a trading instrument than as a store of value. On the longer term, though, I believe Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are likely to become another store of value, next to gold ( GLD ). Compared to gold, cryptocurrency has the advantage that it can also be used as a liquid means of payment at the same time. We can already see in graph 1 at the beginning of this article that Bitcoin's volatility has come down during the last 10 years, and I believe this development is likely to continue. Bitcoin might or might not act as an inflation hedge (the jury is still out on that one), but I am convinced that cryptocurrency will play a large role in the future of payment and store of value. Though volatility seems to be decreasing, please keep in mind that investing in cryptocurrency is a very risky business.

As the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform’s token rebounds from its November 2022 low of $0.4, crypto enthusiasts are left wondering whether this momentum is sufficient to initiate a sustained bullish trend for CRV. Over the weekend, cryptocurrency tracker Lookonchain detected an interesting activity involving two significant whales. The first whale orchestrated a substantial withdrawal, amassing a staggering 19.56 million CRV tokens valued at approximately $10.33 million from the popular crypto exchange Binance. Related Reading: Maker (MKR) Inks 20% Price Advance, Leads Top 50 Coins Today What makes this move even more intriguing is that the whale proceeded to stake the entire sum on Convex Finance (CVX), a DeFi platform intricately designed to empower Curve users in enhancing their rewards. Not to be outdone, another whale executed a withdrawal of 5.78 million CRV tokens, worth in excess of $3 million, from Binance on a Sunday, further piquing the curiosity of the crypto community. Whale”0xDf14″ withdrew 5.12M $CRV($2.7M) from #Binance again 6 hours ago. And the whale has withdrawn a total of 19.56M $CRV($10.33M) from #Binance in the past 3 days. The whale staked all $CRV on #Convex.https://t.co/eSOmZSlmk8 pic.twitter.com/8fXj2VVk3T — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 25, 2023 Resistance Looms, Yet Potential For CRV Persists The current price of CRV on CoinGecko stands at $0.515, reflecting a 0.1% decline over the past 24 hours but showing a promising seven-day rise of 16%. Despite the upward surge, CRV is currently confronting a resistance zone in the vicinity of the $0.55 mark, potentially attributable to short-term traders capitalizing on their gains. In the event that supply pressure mounts, this altcoin could undergo a minor retreat, possibly descending to levels around $0.5 or even $0.45 as it regains its bullish footing. CRV market cap currently at $459 million. Chart: TradingView.com If the ongoing recovery trend retains its momentum, CRV’s price, according to a price report, may aspire to another notable ascent, targeting a 10% upswing to challenge the upper threshold of a long-standing channel pattern. Taking a step back to assess the broader picture, the CRV token has endured a prolonged correction phase, ensnared within a descending channel pattern that has persisted since February 2023. Related Reading: Maker (MKR) Inks 20% Price Advance, Leads Top 50 Coins Today Implications For The Future As CRV navigates the currents of the crypto market, the recent surge in whale accumulation adds a layer of anticipation to its journey. Whether this accumulation is indicative of a more sustained bullish run remains to be seen, as the token grapples with resistance levels and supply dynamics. Nonetheless, the evolving dynamics surrounding CRV underscore the ever-evolving nature of the cryptocurrency space, where market sentiment and investor behavior can rapidly shift the course of a digital asset.

42392464,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg703T,1695981600,"Sam Bankman-Fried Almost Tweeted About His Depression, Drafts Show","FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has a right to shape the narrative around him, his lawyers argued during a court hearing last month. Unposted tweets obtained by CoinDesk suggest he may have been trying to craft a new image for himself since as soon as last December by discussing his mental health and prescribed medication.  “Things are a spectrum,” Bankman-Fried wrote before his arrest last year on fraud and conspiracy charges. ”I don’t have major depressive disorder, probably. But I do generally test positive for dysthymia [a form of mild, long-term depression], and anhedonia [the inability to feel pleasure]. My lows aren’t unusually low – but I generally don’t have highs.”  Last week, highlights from 250 pages of similar draft tweets were published by the New York Times after being leaked by social media personality and Bankman-Fried confidante Tiffany Fong. CoinDesk viewed the tweet thread entitled “EmSam” in December prior to his arrest, and Fong reportedly received the trove of writings the following month.  With one million followers, Bankman-Fried was a prolific and compulsive poster on Twitter, now known as X. But the unposted tweets show him describing his thoughts with influencers as he faces fraud charges related to FTX’s collapse. By March, the social media platform was not among the approved websites Bankman-Fried was permitted to access while confined in his parents' home in Stanford, California.  “According to Twitter, it’s because, uh, something about veganism or gambling or addiction or sex. EmSam helps, a bit. It helps me stay focused, and organized.”  The Federal District Court in Manhattan revoked Bankman-Fried’s bail and sent him to jail in August after deciding he was interfering with trial witnesses, in part by sending documents to the media. Prosecutors argued that Bankman-Fried sent diary excerpts written by Caroline Ellison, a key witness and executive within the FTX empire whom he once dated, to reporters in an attempt to intimidate her by casting her in a negative light. Bankman-Fried’s attorneys are disputing a temporary gag order barring him from speaking to the media.  Bankman-Fried said he first realized something was awry with his mental health during high school. “I’d already lived for 16 years. And somehow, never during those years had I really asked myself what made me happy. Nothing does… And at the end of the day I don’t really know what ‘happiness’ means. None of us really do. But the thing everyone describes–it’s not a thing I feel,” he writes.  Linking to a WebMD article, Bankman-Fried explained over the past decade he’s been prescribed an antidepressant called EmSam to balance his mental health. As a vocal proponent of EmSam, the former FTX CEO hired a psychiatrist as a company coach who prescribed the medication and who “witnesses have described as liberally dispensing prescriptions to FTX employees,” according to Department of Justice attorneys. Amid FTX’s downfall, speculation heightened on Bankman-Friend’s use of EmSam.  “According to Twitter, it’s because, uh, something about veganism or gambling or addiction or sex,” Bankman-Fried wrote. “EmSam helps, a bit. It helps me stay focused, and organized.”  While in custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, Bankman-Fried’s attorney, Marc Cohen, has brought up medical issues regarding his client’s access to prescription drugs. Cohen said in an August hearing that Bankman-Fried was not receiving his Adderall and was fearful of running out of EmSam. Moreover, he was subsisting on “bread and water, and sometimes peanut butter” because his vegan dietary restrictions were not being addressed.  The change in lifestyle from a luxury penthouse in the Bahamas to a Brooklyn jail may be drastic, but one of Bankman-Fried's unpublished tweets suggests it may not make much of a difference to him. “I’ve never really been into fancy things. I’d like to think it’s because it would be selfish, but honestly a lot of it is because fancy things won’t make me happy anyway. Because nothing will,” Bankman-Fried wrote.  “I did what I could to provide a nice life for those working for FTX – it was one part of trying to recruit the best team we could. But when I hear about all the wild parties we were supposedly happening, all I can think is, ‘I wish my life was as exciting as Twitter thinks it is.’ And then, ‘nevermind, it wouldn’t make me happy anyway.’”  DOJ attorneys have attempted to bar a mental disease defense from Bankman-Fried’s attorneys, arguing they’ve had no notice of such a defense before the appropriate deadline. After Bankman-Fried’s attorneys proposed jury questions to gather opinions of ADHD last week, the government filed a letter to the Southern District of New York court, arguing that such questions were “unnecessarily intrusive” and “telling the jury that the defendant has ADHD would serve only to improperly cast the defendant at the outset of the trial in a sympathetic light… Information about the defendant’s mental health – whether about his diagnosis of ADHD or depression – has no proper place at trial and the defense should also be precluded from mentioning it in opening statement.”  Bankman-Fried’s private writings have been criticized for blaming everyone, but himself.

The FTX founder, who has pleaded not guilty to charges including wire fraud and conspiracy, will go on trial next week in a New York City federal courtroom. The jury for the case will consist of 12 randomly selected New York State residents and two alternates.​​ CoinDesk spoke with several pedestrians in Manhattan’s Financial District to understand what this group could look like.  Many of these random New Yorkers suggested that they would need a better understanding of the digital asset space and Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency empire to be confident in their judgment. A majority declined to be interviewed for this article and video, claiming that they were not familiar with the story, and some even expressed distaste for the topic.  One pedestrian, when asked if they were interested in crypto, replied back “no, nor do I have any interest in anyone involved in it.”  Another person, Lucy Rafter – a law student originally from Ireland – admitted that she doesn’t know anything about crypto.  “It’s like a new fad,” she said. “I'd need to learn everything from scratch.”  On the other hand, Haseeb Khurram, a visitor from overseas who claimed to have “at least $7,000” stuck in the bankrupt exchange, has strong opinions about the upcoming trial.  “He should be guilty and he deserves what is coming for him,” he said.  An outlier from the interviewees was Jared Blikre, a seasoned reporter and anchor at Yahoo Finance.  The collapse of FTX reminded him of the MF Global bankruptcy in 2011, “but it's about 10 times worse,” the finance veteran said. However, Blikre doubted that he would be selected for the jury given his expertise. “I know a little bit too much.”  Attorneys for the Department of Justice and Bankman-Fried’s defense filed their questions for possible jurors earlier this month, which they hope will gauge if those who could be selected are familiar with the case, the cryptocurrency industry or the “effective altruism” philosophy that Bankman-Fried championed.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Dilin Massand,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/29/we-asked-new-yorkers-if-theyd-heard-of-sam-bankman-fried,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e1f46e024ac913c867577de517fd64efb9c96e0-2957x1663.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42409618,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcM7Mj,1695981600,"EmSam, Jury Questions and Another Denial for Bankman-Fried","In a rare display of candor – or as part of a calculated exercise in reputation management – Sam Bankman-Fried delved deep into his mental health struggles in a trove of unposted tweets obtained by CoinDesk’s Christine Lee and published for the first time on Friday. “I don’t really know what ‘happiness’ means,” he said in one of the tweets, which he wrote just weeks after his crypto empire blew up last year, as he was facing down a tidal wave of public scorn.  The tweets published by CoinDesk strike a similar tone to those obtained earlier this month by the New York Times; in both cases, it's difficult to discern whether Bankman-Fried’s musings provide an authentic glimpse into the beleaguered crypto founder’s psyche, or whether his mental health battles and personal anecdotes have been played up for sympathy. On this front, it’s impossible to fairly speculate, though it seems likely that Bankman-Fried’s mental health struggles could play a role in his defense.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  CoinDesk’s Dilin Massand and Victor Chen also went down to lower Manhattan to speak with random New Yorkers to approximate what a jury of Bankman-Fried’s peers might look like. Some people heard of FTX and its once-famous founder. Others suggested they wouldn’t feel comfortable being on a jury without knowing more about the industry.  Also this week, Judge Lewis Kaplan – who is overseeing Bankman-Fried’s trial – struck down a request from the FTX founder’s lawyers asking that he be temporarily released from prison. Bankman-Fried has been held in Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center since his bail was revoked in July, and his lawyers argued for the third time on Thursday that this has made it difficult for them to prepare for trial. With Bankman-Fried’s trial set to begin next week, the argument from his lawyers this time around was that Bankman-Fried would need time to strategize during his trial; previously, they’d asked he be granted release ahead of time.  Kaplan again denied the motion – arguing the FTX founder has had ample opportunity to review the evidence and prepare his defense over the past several months. Kaplan did make some concessions, however, ordering the Department of Prisons to ensure Bankman-Fried be delivered to court at a brisk 7 a.m. on most days of the trial – designed to give him and his lawyers a bit of extra time to incorporate fresh testimony into their defense.  Part of Kaplan’s rationale for denying the release request came from his belief, as a seasoned jurist, that Bankman-Fried might present a flight risk. “Your client could be looking at a very long sentence,” Kaplan told Bankman-Fried’s lawyers. “If things look bleak […] if he had that opportunity, maybe he would seek to flee.”  On a housekeeping note, we officially have the court calendar for the trial through Nov. 11. The court will meet four days a week except for the week of Oct. 22, when it will only be in session two days. There will be no trial on Oct. 9, 20-25, Nov. 3 or Nov. 10. The trial will likely continue after that, the judge noted during yesterday’s hearing.

Global oil prices retreated after a surge, while stocks in Asia and Europe inched higher as of Asian afternoon hours.  Crypto markets were buoyed mainly as participants expected increased demand in the short term as a formal ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) was floated by financial giant VanEck. However, some analysts warned of selling pressure on riskier assets such as bitcoin, citing all-time highs in certain oil markets.  Some analysts priced in a 90% chance of the ETF getting approved in the first week of October, impacting bearish positions. Strength in crypto markets seemed to bump majors, such as Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA tokens – each adding as much as 4.5%.  Traders at Japanese exchange Bitbank said in a daily note that they expect bitcoin prices to move towards the $28,000 level, citing ETF optimism.  “Despite the fact that the SEC postponed their decision to approve or disapprove Ark, BlackRock, and Valkyrie’s bitcoin ETFs this week, the market’s hope for spot bitcoin ETF approval seems to have been revitalized following the Ether Futures ETF decision,” analyst Yuya Hasegawa shared.  Meanwhile, Tellor’s TRB tokens continued a multi-week rally to rise some 10% in the past 24 hours, extending monthly gains to over 250%, data from CoinGecko shows. High funding rates on TRB futures could explain some of the demand for these tokens, analysts at Coinalyze said in a message, amid the lack of fundamental catalysts.  Funding rates are periodic payments that traders on perpetual futures markets pay from one side of the trade to the other. Depending on their open positions, traders will either pay or receive funding. The payments ensure there are always participants on both sides of the trade.  Participants utilize sophisticated strategies to collect funding rates while hedging losses due to token movements – which may, eventually, create market imbalance and volatility.",POSITIVE,ADA | BTC | SOL,ADA | ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/29/bitcoin-traders-eye-28k-solana-cardano-and-tellor-lead-altcoin-bump,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1820368dbf46cb6d80d46f9a07c9d96d2966155-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

SEC Request For Comments On BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Application In its release concerning BlackRock’s application, the SEC called for written comments on why the iShares Bitcoin Trust should be approved or disapproved. This move ultimately extends the period in which the Commission can decide on the proposed rule change, with the next deadline coming on January 15, 2024. Related Reading: IPO Frenzy: What Happens To XRP Price If Ripple Stock Climbs To $600? As part of its request for comments, the SEC specifically asked commenters to give their views on whether the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) represented a regulated market of significant size for spot Bitcoin. It also asked them to give their views on the correlation between the Bitcoin spot market and the CME Bitcoin futures market. It is unknown what the SEC aims to achieve from this, considering that the court had ruled in Grayscale’s case against the Commission that the spot and futures market were correlated. Therefore, there was no reason why ETFs relating to both markets should enjoy different regulatory treatment. Meanwhile, in a similar fashion, the SEC also extended the deadline for a decision on the Spot Bitcoin ETF applications of Bitwise, Invesco, and Valkyrie. Following this, the next deadline for the SEC to decide on these applications is in January 2024, with Bitwise’s coming on the 14, Invesco on the 15, and Valkyrie’s on the 17 of that month. It is worth mentioning that the SEC can still further delay these applications one last time before it finally has to decide on them. If that happens, these ETFs are likely not to launch (if approval is given) until mid-March. Meanwhile, the SEC must decide on the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF by January 10, 2024. The SEC is still expected to delay the Spot Bitcoin ETF applications of WisdomTree, VanEck, and Fidelity before a potential government shutdown on October 1. Not A Bad Day For Valkyrie Despite the delay of its Spot Bitcoin ETF application, asset manager Valkyrie and its investors still had something to cheer about, as it is reported to have gotten the nod to offer exposure to ETH futures contracts through its Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF. The asset manager had earlier applied to the SEC to convert its Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) to a new fund that holds both Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Addresses Bitcoin Adviser’s Claims That XRP Is Centralized This move was then touted as a way for the asset manager to gain a first-mover advantage over the rest, and it looks like it worked, as it will become the first to offer US investors the chance to bet on the future price of Ethereum. Confirming this news, Bloomberg Analyst James Seyffart stated that Valkyrie’s ticker will begin holding “a small % of ETH futures” from September 29 and will switch to “50% ETH 50% BTC” from next week.

The move comes as no surprise, Coinbase acquired a license in Bermuda to operate a spot exchange back in April following a gung-ho approach from U.S. regulators, with the ultimate intention of rolling out a perpetual futures platform.  Perpetual futures are a type of cash-settled derivatives contract that allow traders to ""long"" or ""short"" an underlying asset with leverage. Instead of the contract expiring every month or quarter, perpetual swap traders pay a funding rate that represents the difference between the mark and index price of the underlying asset, this ensures that pricing stays efficient.  Following last year's collapse of FTX, which was the largest crypto futures platform at the time, overall liquidity and trading volume across the crypto market plummeted. Almost one year later and the market is still reeling from that slump, with thin liquidity remaining heavily concentrated across a handful of exchanges.  Binance currently dominates the crypto market in terms of trading volume. Its spot market has racked up $6 billion in volume compared to Coinbase's $1.2 billion, for derivatives, meanwhile, Binance generated $32 billion in trading volume over the past 24-hours, equating to around $9.6 million in daily revenue from trading fees. If Coinbase can capture a portion of this market, it has the potential to continue its streak of beating revenue estimates.  Kaiko analyst Riyad Carey told CoinDesk that Coinbase is ""well positioned"" to capture some of that forgotten market share.  ""Regarding Coinbase, I do think that it's well positioned to capture significant market share,"" Carey said. ""Given Binance's recent troubles it stands to reason that larger traders and institutions may be skittish to hold significant funds on the exchange. On the other hand, Coinbase is one of the most trusted exchanges, which sets them up nicely.""

18174371,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553474,1695975017,Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today? Insights From Leading Analysts,"In the last 24 hours, the Bitcoin price experienced a significant surge of 2%, touching an intraday high of $27,320 yesterday. As of this writing, the BTC price hovered near the $27,000 mark. Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today? Several analysts have offered insights into the recent upward trajectory. Renowned crypto specialist Skew elucidated on Twitter, “BTC Aggregate CVDs & Delta: Lower timeframe stuff but pretty clear spot absorption around the high, so $27.2K is an important price area to clear for spot buyers. Most of the push up was perp driven with spot trailing price (short liquidations & strong perp bid).” Related Reading: Bonds Out, Bitcoin In? Bloomberg Analyst Predicts Major Portfolio Shifts Skew’s chart unveils that the momentum was predominantly backed by short liquidations and sturdy bids in the perpetual markets. Upon touching the $27,200 threshold, spot market selling began, indicating a potential local zenith for the Bitcoin price. Complementing the data, on-chain analytics firm Santiment confirmed that open long and short Bitcoin positions surged as Bitcoin’s price enjoyed a bullish Thursday. The chart shared by Santiment correlates Bitcoin’s ascent with the augmented open interest in the futures market. “After a quick price retrace after those longs & shorts quickly closed yesterday, they have remained high today, allowing prices to maintain their levels,” the on-chain tracker said. On a bullish note, Santiment commented that Bitcoin sharks and whale addresses, which are defined as 10-10,000 BTC wallets, have now accumulated to their highest amount held in 2023, amounting to 13.03 million BTC. Additionally, Tether sharks and whales are accumulating buying power. “This is generally a bullish combination,” Santiment remarked. Nonetheless, the analysis firm also sounded a note of caution: “The long-term outlook is bright for Bitcoin with whales accumulating BTC & USDT. However, watch for a short-term correction, with traders profit taking heavily as $27K hit Thursday. When the 7D MVRV gets below 0, that may be ideal for another leg up.” Related Reading: Marathon Digital Mines Invalid Bitcoin Block Amid Heightened BTC Volatility Their data further highlights that during yesterday’s significant move, Bitcoin showcased its highest on-chain profit/loss mark in the past quarter, which usually hints at an impending short-term correction. DaanCrypto, another industry pundit, remarked during the price flux, “Bitcoin Price up, Spot Premium up, Funding down. This move has seen a strong sustained spot bid so far which is looking quite healthy as we speak.” Similarly, renowned crypto analyst Exitpump chimed in during the price crescendo with the observation, “BTC Binance spot orderbook: Noticed chasing bid on the book with big asks stacked slightly above the price, it’s getting interesting. Maybe a spoof buy wall, but I think that it just grinds higher.” What’s Next For BTC Price? As described in one of our last analyses, the Bitcoin price is facing a crucial monthly close tomorrow, Saturday. Rekt Capital, a seasoned crypto analyst, recently spotlighted the significance of Bitcoin’s approaching monthly candle close. Via X, he emphasized that Bitcoin is currently treating the $27,000 mark as a resistance. He elaborated, “Bitcoin needs to monthly close above $27,091 for this to be a fake-breakdown. Otherwise, the breakdown will be technically confirmed.” In this case, a fall toward $23,000 could be imminent. On the 1-day chart, Bitcoin is showing strong bullish momentum today. The BTC price has managed to break the (black) trend line. The task today is to defend the re-test. If it succeeds, a monthly close above $27,100 seems very likely, and a rally similar to June could be possible.

Ether traded at $1,660 in Asian afternoon hours on Friday, extending gains to more than 6% since Monday.  Prices were likely buoyed as hopes for a quick approval could mean demand for ether from traditional finance players, who have, so far, had limited options to trade the second-largest token by market capitalization.  Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas Ether futures ETFs are ""highly likely (90% odds) to start rolling out in early Oct."" Balchunas said in a later tweet that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wanted to ""accelerate the launch"" of these futures, citing sources.  The price bump caught bearish traders in the crosshair, however. Coinglass data shows some $11 million in liquidations for traders of ether futures on crypto exchanges who were short – or betting against – the asset. This accounted for nearly 85% of all ether liquidations on Thursday.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader's initial margin. This happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position or fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.  OKX traders accounted for a third of liquidated positions, followed by Binance and Huobi, the data shows.  VanEck, the $77.8 billion asset under management firm, said Thursday it was preparing to roll out its ether futures ETF that will invest in standardized, cash-settled ETH futures contracts traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

What sets this rally apart is the consistency in MKR’s price patterns, characterized by higher highs and higher lows, a clear indicator of a bullish trend in the market.

They emphasize the importance of vigilance concerning the current influx of tokens to exchanges, as this trend may foreshadow a potential market correction in the short term.

In June, regulators charged Binance with multiple legal violations for facilitating trades in cryptocurrencies, such as solana's SOL, cardano's ADA and the Binance stablecoin BUSD, which the SEC alleged constituted unregistered securities.  That’s become one of the most major cases in crypto right now, as the world’s biggest crypto exchange – alongside rivals like Coinbase – seek to argue that crypto isn’t caught by existing heavy-handed U.S. financial laws.  Now Circle argues that assets tied to the dollar such as BUSD and its own USDC can’t constitute securities, in part because its users don’t expect any profit from standalone purchases.  “Payment stablecoins, on their own, do not have the essential features of an investment contract,” meaning they fall outside of SEC jurisdiction, Circle’s filing said. “Decades of case law support the view that an asset sale — decoupled from any post-sale promises or obligations by the seller — is not sufficient to establish an investment contract.”  The SEC alleged BUSD was sold as an investment contract because Binance marketed it as offering yield through reward programs. Binance, its U.S. arm and its owner Changpeng “CZ” Zhao last week filed to dismiss the SEC case, arguing the regulator is seeking authority over digital assets without congressional authorization.  Circle’s filing, known as an amicus curiae or friend of the court brief, is made in part by its Chief Legal Officer Heath Tarbert, himself former chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, another federal regulator which is suing Binance.",NEUTRAL,ADA | SOL,ADA | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SOL | BNB,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/29/circle-intervenes-in-binances-sec-case-argues-stablecoins-arent-securities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/46b1f8bd6a7171599e3050e8a05051e465fae3b5-710x458.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392470,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg70dN,1695949906,"Sam Bankman-Fried Scoops Help CoinDesk Win a Loeb Award, a Top Journalism Prize","CoinDesk journalists won a Gerald Loeb Award, widely considered the top prize in financial and business journalism, for exposing the shaky foundation beneath Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency empire and then vividly documenting the industry giant’s rapid, groundshaking and sometimes bizarre demise.  Ian Allison, Tracy Wang, Nick Baker, Cheyenne Ligon, Sam Reynolds, Sam Kessler, Nikhilesh De and Reilly Decker’s win in the beat reporting category was announced at an event Thursday night in New York. They were revealed as finalists in August.  Named for Gerald M. Loeb, the awards were established in 1957 to “encourage and support reporting on business and finance that inform and protect the private investor and the general public,” according to the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles, which oversees them.  The centerpiece story was Allison’s explosive Nov. 2, 2022, piece that raised questions about the sturdiness of Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried’s large trading firm, and, by extension, how safe the billionaire’s affiliated and better-known crypto exchange FTX was. Other CoinDesk stories honored by the Loebs revealed the unusual living arrangements of Bankman-Fried’s inner circle, documented (as it was still happening) a massive hack of FTX as the company was collapsing and gave readers a colorful view inside Bankman-Fried’s first court appearance.  Nine days after Allison’s initial story came out, Bankman-Fried’s companies were in bankruptcy court – a collapse so big (FTX had been valued at $32 billion earlier in 2022) and so fast it has little or no precedent. He was arrested soon after, and his trial in a Manhattan courtroom begins next week.  Allison’s initial scoop was widely cited as the catalyst for the collapse. Thousands of news stories credited CoinDesk for setting off the chain of events, including pieces from high-profile publications like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, The Financial Times, The Verge, New York Magazine, CNN and NPR’s “Planet Money” podcast.  The fallout reverberated throughout the crypto industry and even hurt CoinDesk’s corporate sibling Genesis and parent company Digital Currency Group, underscoring CoinDesk’s editorial independence and dedication to telling important stories.  “I’m totally blown away and humbled yet also immensely proud because this outstanding group of reporters and editors totally earned it,” said Kevin Reynolds, the editor-in-chief of CoinDesk. “The journalistic excellence, the commitment to following the story no matter where it led and the true esprit de corps are like nothing I’ve ever seen before.”  Read more: CoinDesk Wins a Polk Award, One of Journalism's Top Prizes, for Explosive FTX Coverage  Allison’s story detailed Alameda’s private balance sheet, which he obtained from a confidential source. The article’s explosive revelation was that Alameda was on potentially shaky footing because of its deep financial exposure to the FTT token issued by FTX. FTT made up nearly half of Alameda’s $14.6 billion of assets.  That was a surprising degree of financial entanglement for two supposedly separate companies, and also a pretty speculative asset to stash much of a trading firm’s assets into. If sentiment around FTX and Bankman-Fried were to tank, the price of FTT could fall, dragging Alameda down with it.  And that’s basically what happened. Four days after Allison’s story came out, Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao tweeted that “due to recent revelations,” his exchange would sell its hefty FTT holdings. That quickly drove down the price of FTT, putting Bankman-Fried’s companies into a tailspin.  Bankman-Fried was forced two days later to seek a bailout from Binance, a rival crypto exchange. But that proposed takeover fell apart in a day, something another Allison scoop (and Loeb winner) revealed was likely to happen hours before it was made official. Then, on Nov. 11, Bankman-Fried’s companies were forced to file for bankruptcy protection.  CoinDesk’s third Loeb-winning scoop that set the industry abuzz was a story by Tracy Wang that revealed Bankman-Fried and nine co-workers lived together in a luxury Bahamas condominium and at times dated each other while running his companies – including the fact that Bankman-Fried and Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison had once been a couple.  The piece raised concerns about nepotism, secrecy and conflicts of interest, previewing the tone of a scathing report issued soon after on FTX’s extremely lax administrative procedures. Besides Bankman-Fried and Ellison, the story named senior FTX executives Gary Wang and Nishad Singh; Ellison, Gary Wang and Singh all subsequently pleaded guilty to federal charges related to FTX.  Two other CoinDesk stories were honored by the Loebs. One documented the dramatic hack of FTX hours after its bankruptcy filing, an attack that drained hundreds of millions of dollars. Cheyenne Ligon, Sam Reynolds, Sam Kessler, Nikhilesh De and Reilly Decker’s collaborative, late-night reporting effort allowed CoinDesk to publish an evocative account of what was going on as it was still happening.  That story and the three scoops by Allison and Tracy Wang were edited by Nick Baker, who was also awarded a Loeb.  CoinDesk’s final Loeb winner was Ligon’s engrossing account, edited by De, of Bankman-Fried’s first court appearance, which was in the Bahamas. The story was the only detailed piece on the often-colorful event.

18163562,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553440,1695949223,"Billionaire Takes Over As GameStop CEO, Bullish For Dogecoin?","Billionaire investor Ryan Cohen has been appointed as the new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of GameStop, a brick-and-mortar video game retailer in the United States, a move that could potentially impact Dogecoin. GameStop’s stock and the Dogecoin price have shown signs of correlation. Before assuming this role, Cohen had been the Executive Chairman of GameStop since January 2022 and remained the largest shareholder. The experienced investor takes over in what analysts said is an attempt by the board to turn around the fortunes of the public company. Pro-GameStop Billionaire Takes Over As CEO In this role, Cohen takes over as the President, Chief Executive, and Chairman of GameStop, representing a move to overhaul and possibly revive the company’s leadership structure. While he assumes several positions, reports indicate that the billionaire won’t receive a salary. Following news of Cohen’s announcement, GameStop prices surged 10%. Analysts interpret this expansion as confidence in the experienced investor’s capability and even genuine commitment to sparking a turnaround following challenges in 2022 and the shifting landscape that has seen sales in brick-and-mortar stores fall. Related Reading: Research Firm Reveals Its “Altcoin Trading Playbook” The appointment is bullish for GameStop because Cohen is one of the largest shareholders. From September 2020, the billionaire started accumulating aggressively through to December 2020. The billionaire publicly supported a stock that hedge funds had ignored, as they were betting on a video game retailer to go bankrupt. However, in January 2021, due to a “short squeeze,” GameStop’s stock prices surged by 1,500% as retailers jumped on board, causing the stock to reach around $81. Will Dogecoin Mirror GameStop’s Rally Of 2021? The sharp expansion of GameStop in January due to FOMO and retailers banking on a “meme stock” bear the same characteristics as the sudden rally of Dogecoin in the first half of 2021. At peaks, Dogecoin soared to as high as $0.78 as support from Elon Musk, the world’s richest entrepreneur, pumped the coin to record levels. The CEO of X openly expressed support for DOGE, even appearing on Sunday Night Live (SNL) as the “Doge Master.” Related Reading: Maker (MKR) Rockets To $1,500 With 15% Surge, Will This Run Continue? Beyond Elon Musk, Dogecoin’s status as the first meme coin and its alignment with the broader trend of meme stocks rallying in early 2021, driven chiefly by online communities and social media, fueled DOGE prices. DOGE prices have since cooled off, falling by over 80% as bears pressed on, reversing the project’s huge valuations. Even so, supporters remain bullish, expecting the meme coin to recover in the sessions ahead. It remains to be seen if Elon Musk will continue tweeting frequently about DOGE. The billionaire is being sued in New York for allegedly promoting Dogecoin as a “get-rich-quick” scheme. The lawsuit claims that Musk, Tesla, and SpaceX were involved in a “racketeering conspiracy” to support DOGE.
