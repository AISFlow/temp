In a statement to the press today, bitcoin trading platform LedgerX confirmed rumors that it has already begun trading cryptocurrency derivatives, an offering it first received approval to begin selling to institutional investors in July.  According to figures provided by the company, LedgerX saw 176 swaps and options contracts traded in its first week, with notional values of more than $1 million.  LedgerX CEO Paul Chou said in a statement:  ""This week, a new standard is set for transparency, oversight and counter-party assurance. Institutional investors and traders can now rely on a guaranteed clearing and settlement process when transacting bitcoin contracts.""  Notably, while the initial LedgerX trades appear to be exclusively in bitcoin, the details of the license give the company the ability to add other assets that qualify as cryptocurrencies.  The company, based in New York, is licensed as both a swap execution facility (SEF) and a derivatives clearing organization (DCO).  LedgerX is now reportedly exploring working with options trading shops, asset managers, hedge funds, bitcoin miners, family offices and investment banks, as a way to grow its number of customers.  Chou concluded:  ""Our regulated, institutional-grade platform enables participants who were sitting on the sidelines, to enter the digital currency market.""

42427959,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4vrh,1508533529,BlackRock Strategist: There's No 'Right or Wrong' Price for Bitcoin,"The chief investment strategist for BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, said in a new interview that he doesn't know where to peg the ""fair"" price of bitcoin.  Speaking with Business Insider, Richard Turnill said that cryptocurrencies have experienced ""spectacular price increases"" in recent months, leading him to conclude: ""I would say that cryptocurrencies show many characteristics of a bubble right now.""  His remarks echo those of other Wall Street-based analysts and investors, including Ray Dalio, who leads the world's largest hedge fund, that have argued that the cryptocurrency market is in bubble territory.  And while BlackRock's own chief executive offered cautiously optimistic remarks earlier this month on the subject, Turnill argued that, in his view, there's no way to assess a ""fair value"" for bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.  He told the publication:  ""The main argument for buying them is that prices have risen and are therefore going to continue to rise over time. But there's no inherent right or wrong price for bitcoin. You could say, 'What's the fair value?' You know: 'I'm an investor; I like to think about the fair value of stocks of bonds.' I can't answer what's the fair value for bitcoin or any cryptocurrency. For that reason, I'm not an owner.""  This is not the first time Turnill has expressed concern with cryptocurrencies. In July, he referred to the cryptocurrency market as ""scary"" based on then-recent market moves.  Despite his concerns about cryptocurrencies, however, Turnill praised blockchain technology in general, saying the tool will likely be increasingly used.  BlackRock has already begun ""starting to use blockchain,"" according to BI.

42427964,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4vzh,1508527809,TSMC: Cryptocurrency Mining Drove Strong Third Quarter Revenue,"The chief financial officer for the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's largest independent semiconductor foundry, cited cryptocurrency mining in the firm's third-quarter results.  The company – which provides semiconductor manufacturing services for a range of industries, including firms that design and assemble application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for cryptocurrency mining – announced third-quarter revenue of $8.32 billion, an increase of 17.9% compared to the previous quarter and 1.5% year-over-year.  Boosting those figures, Lora Ho said, is demand for semiconductors used in mining products.  She said in a statement:  ""The strength of our third-quarter revenue was driven mainly by major mobile product launches and a generally healthy demand environment, including cryptocurrency mining. However, this strength of our third quarter revenue was partially dampened by our customers’ continued inventory management.""  It's a notable acknowledgment from a major hardware manufacturer, but one that's also unsurprising given past statements from other firms that have seen windfalls from the interest in mining, the process by which new transactions are added to the blockchain.  Both Nvidia and AMD, which make graphics cards, have both pointed to mining as a beneficial force for their bottom lines. Indeed, it was Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang who declared in August that ""cryptocurrencies and blockchain are here to say.""  Mining activity, as pointed out by some Wall Street analysts, is also attracting investors to the companies' public stocks.

Higher Price Push Still Possible on Search Demand,"The price of bitcoin may have hit a new all-time high above $6,000 today, but it's already showing signs it may be primed to push higher.  At press time, the bitcoin-US dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate was roughly $5,950, down slightly from the day's high, but up 9 percent on the week amidst what proved to be strong demand for bitcoin in the $5,000-to-$5,500 range.  Week-on-week, bitcoin is up 9 percent, while on a monthly basis, it is up a staggering 53.66%.  Looking ahead, however, at least two underlying trends suggest it may trace higher in the days or weeks ahead.  Search volumes rise  On the back of the all-time high, Google search volume has notably shot up in the last 4 hours.  Long an indicator of potential buying (the internet-based asset is bought online mostly after all), this trend suggests the rally has attracted the attention of the investor community.  According to data from Google Trends, bitcoin search volume is near all-time highs.  The situation could easily devolve into a self-feeding cycle – i.e. more investors enter the market for its stellar returns, and end up pushing prices higher.  Volumes on exchanges so far show that they've risen to match. At press time, 24-hour volumes were up across all major exchanges, with British Virgin Islands-based Bitfinex showing the highest increase at just over 14 percent.  Likewise, volumes on Bithumb (BTC/KRW) and bitFlyer (BTC/JPY), two other large regional exchanges, have jumped 7 percent and 6 percent, respectively.  Weekly chart - Charting the uncharted territory  As for price action analysis, there is little reason to worry except for the overbought technical indicators. Healthy pullbacks cannot be ruled out, however, the outlook would remain constructive as long as dip demand is strong.  Key levels that could act as resistance:  $6,000 (psychological level)  $6,196.81 (100% Fib extension of the move from July low-August high-September low)  $7,073 (161.8% Fib extension of move from July low-August high-September low)  On the downside, moving averages (50-MA, 100-MA & 200-MA) could work as strong support levels.

In a press release, the company announced today that it would first be working on business-to-business (B2B) transactions with the tech, as part of a bid to ""address challenges of speed, transparency and costs in cross-border payments.""  Mastercard first revealed its blockchain work in October 2016, releasing systems aimed at smart contracts and payment settlement processes. At the time, blockchain lead Justin Pinkham said the company was looking for collaborators to work with the company’s platform.  Now, MasterCard is encouraging other firms to begin settling transactions through its blockchain APIs, which it says can ease some of the friction experienced during cross-border payments processes.  Ken Moore, Mastercard Labs' executive vice president, said in a statement:  ""By combining Mastercard blockchain technology with our settlement network and associated network rules, we have created a solution that is safe, secure, auditable and easy to scale.""  The company said it intends to combine its blockchain APIs with other services to allow partners to develop their own use cases and create unique transaction types.  Further, Mastercard also highlighted its efforts to seek intellectual property rights around its uses of the tech, as well as its work with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance on use cases ""well outside the scope of Mastercard's traditional payments environment.""  For example, in a recently released patent application, the company indicated it was looking into a uniform payment settlement system, one that could utilize blockchain as a vehicle for B2B payments.

According to Reuters, the Islamic Research and Training Institute has struck an agreement with two startups – Ateon and SettleMint, the latter of which is based in Belgium – to perform technical feasibility studies ahead of any deeper research and development. SettleMint published the news about the deal on its official blog earlier this week.  Sharia-compliant finance generally forbids the collection of interest on loans, as well as speculative investments. While it's unclear what specific types of products it might ultimately consider deploying, the group reportedly said that it was interested in asset exchanges that can settle in near-instant time.  Matthew Van Niekerk, CEO and founder of SettleMint, said in a statement:  ""We are very excited to be able to contribute to this project. One of the core values of SettleMint has always been to change the world for the better, and by using the blockchain technology to further financial inclusion and development of the 57 member countries, fits our ambitions to the letter.""  According to the statement by SettleMint, blockchain smart contracts can help automate the contractual processes for Islamic institutions while ""alleviating the additional administrative and legal complexities as well as redundancies associated with Sharia-compliant financial products.""

In an announcement, MIT explained the certificates were issued through an app called Blockcerts Wallet, which allows graduates to securely share a ""verifiable"" and ""tamper-proof"" digital version of their diplomas with prospective employers and others.  The blockchain-based pilot is a result of partnership between MIT and Cambridge, MA-based software company Learning Machine, which jointly developed the Blockcerts open standard last year.  MIT registrar and senior associate dean Mary Callahan said:  ""From the beginning, one of our primary motivations has been to empower students to be the curators of their own credentials. This pilot makes it possible for them to have ownership of their records and be able to share them in a secure way, with whomever they choose.""  According to Chris Jagers, co-founder and CEO of Learning Machine, MIT is among the first universities to have ""issued official records in a format that can exist even if the institution goes away.  ""People can own and use their official records, which is a fundamental shift,"" he said.  The Blockcerts system uses the bitcoin blockchain, according to Jagers, because it ""prioritizes security over other qualities like speed, cost or ease of use.""  While the diploma information itself isn't stored on the blockchain, the system utilizes a timestamped transaction indicating that MIT created the digital record for the certificate. This allows the student to prove ownership of the diploma at a later date.  With interest in the use case for the technology picking up, Malta's Ministry for Education and Employment and Australia's University of Melbourne have also started testing Blockcerts for tracking academic certifications in recent weeks.

The upgrade, named Byzantium, was the first part of Ethereum’s Metropolis development phase, and one of the improvements it introduces, is the time it takes to mine a block in Ethereum. Before Byzantium it took around 30 seconds to mine a block, known as block time, and this is now down to about 14 seconds. This means better transaction throughput, less congestion (although big ICO/TGEs happening over a short time period will still be felt) and generally a faster network. Over the past week, there have been a maximum of a few hundred pending transactions whenever I’ve checked (although it was spiking earlier today due to the request network tokens becoming tradable), impressive numbers considering Ethereum is currently averaging around 21,000 transactions per hour. For comparison, Bitcoin’s average block time is currently 7.5 minutes with roughly 14,000 hourly transactions. October 17th saw a record high 505,000 transactions on Ethereum, and the median waiting time for a transaction to process on Ethereum is currently 77 seconds. The best part of this is that, unless you’re in a hurry and can wait a few minutes for your transaction to go through, according to ETH Gas Station, transaction fees are almost non-existent. To avoid the improvement in block times from doubling the returns for miners, known as block rewards, and thus inflation, also included in the upgrade was a 40 percent reduction of the block reward, pulling it down from five to three ETH per block. So with these impressive numbers, Ethereum community should be happy, right? Despite some rumours and speculation on potential issues that could have caused security bugs, none seems to actually have occurred, and the developers and user communities are pleased with what looks to have been a smooth upgrade process. Although with any extensive system upgrades like Byzantium, it will take some more time and testing before the system can be deemed fully secure and stable.

42427948,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4r3h,1508504404,Every Asset Ever: Circle Pulls 'Trigger' on Investment Product Pipeline,"Can't or won’t?  One of the more secretive companies to yet compete in the blockchain sector, Circle is characteristically tight-lipped about its acquisition of startup Trigger Finance.  Announced last week to little fanfare, the move adds an already up-and-running investment app to its arsenal of products – CirclePay, its most widely known consumer payments app, and Circle Trading, an OTC operation that claims $2 billion in volume monthly.  And while president Sean Neville and CEO Jeremy Allaire were quick to caution that there are no announcements to detail, they were clear that work has been underway.  ""I think what we would be comfortable saying is that digital assets – which are not just digital currencies, but a broader range of assets – it's an area that has grown a lot, but that's not easily accessible to mainstream investors,"" Allaire said  Still, both executives were more candid when speaking about the opportunity they see in expanding their business – one that already boasts offices in Beijing, Boston, Dublin, London, San Francisco, and now, with the addition of the Trigger team, New York.  In fact, Allaire believes that allowing investors access to digital assets might be the biggest opportunity they've yet pursued. In contrast to the stream of statements from mainstream investors seeking to label cryptocurrencies as a bubble, Allaire argued it's anything but.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We believe cryptographic assets and blockchains will consume every form of asset. Ultimately, every equity will be represented with cryptographic assets. Every form of property and asset will become a crypto token, and that seems inevitable.""  Rather than catering to early adopters, however, Neville and Allaire said that the key to creating a profitable company around this opportunity will be making the tech easy to use and approachable, something they argued they've already done with CirclePay.  Also of use will likely be CircleTrading, which already manages the buying and selling of bitcoin, ether, ether classic, zcash, bitcoin cash and litecoin for accredited investors.  To that end, Neville said there are existing frictions inherent in even the most usable blockchain products today – even the wallets and exchanges that have benefitted from a previous influx of investor capital. However, Allaire suggested he perhaps sees any investment play as one that could crossover into areas more akin to traditional investment options.  ""If I'm an investor, and I want exposure to international markets, how do you source that in a way that the average person can feel safe?"" he asked.  Winning investors  Allaire and Neville were keen to position Trigger as a small step toward that long-term vision, though one that hints at a sea change that will bring about that future.  According to Circle, the Trigger team was already attracting retail cryptocurrency investors, calling it the ""fastest area"" of growth for the product. Given that alignment, Neville said the opportunity of serving that audience was best explored together.  Still, Neville and Allaire also see the move as one of positioning – arguing that, even if mainstream investors are dismissive of crypto assets today, they won't be for much longer.  ""Even really intelligent and experienced people have been myopic about what this asset class really is, and based on a limited amount of data, they're not seeing the underlying pattern for how assets are conceived in this new way,"" Neville said.  Looking forward, Neville was keen to stress that, while cryptocurrencies may be worth a collective $170 billion, the key to their long-term value will be opening up new utilities for a wider audience of users.  Bubble or not, Neville expects turbulence ahead, with the certainty of long-term growth, concluding:  ""The markets may include some shake-outs, at the same time that's not going to detract from the maturation happening, and we will see increasing value and sophistication in the participants in the space.""

42427949,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4r7h,1508502620,Ether Prices Hold Above $300 as Fork Fears Fade,"Ether prices continue to hold strong despite technical headwinds.  At press time, the ether-US dollar (ETH/USD) exchange rate is roughly $305, up from a low of $287 in the wake of a recent software upgrade. And while the price may be down from a peak of $350 in the run-up to the release, the relative price stability may be impressive due to the supposedly shaky state of the code.  Of note is that ethereum's new blockchain has still yet to be deemed stable by its developer team. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin informed markets this week that one or two months of further testing may be required before it can be declared as fully secure.  Still, as the blockchain continues to run without issue, concerns about the possibility of a harmful security bug in the new code appear to be fading.  As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has lost 1.6 percent in the last 24 hours. Week-on-week, ETH is down 8.9 percent, while on a monthly basis, it is still up 7.78 percent.  But, will ether capitalize further on the sharp recovery from $287?  The price action analysis suggests that the odds of a bull run in the short-term are low.  Daily chart  The above chart shows:  Wednesday's long-legged (long shadow/long wick) candle shows dip demand. Thus, $287 (Wednesday's low) is a strong support level.  $250 (Post-hard fork high) is likely to act as a strong resistance.  Bearish 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA crossover.  The daily RSI and Stochastic is bearish (below 50.00).  View  A re-test of $287 cannot be ruled out if prices breach the psychological support of $300.  On a larger scheme of things, only a break below $287 (Post-hard for low/Oct 18 low) would signal the rally from the Sept. 15 low of $202 has ended. Prices could then proceed to test $240 levels (Sept. 17 low).  Bullish scenario  A move above $320 in the next 24 hours would add credence to the sharp recovery from $287 and could yield rally to $345-350 levels.

42427938,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4qjh,1508497233,DTCC Milestone: $11 Trillion in Derivatives Gets Closer to the Blockchain,"The company that today settles the lion's share of U.S. securities is moving its flagship blockchain project out of the testing phase.  Revealed in an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, the DTCC reports that it has completed an early version of a blockchain that could one day support the trade of $11 trillion-worth of credit derivatives. The milestone signifies a major development for the financial infrastructure provider, one that also marks a continuation of the largest effort yet to adapt an existing financial infrastructure to a blockchain.  First revealed in January, the goal of the project was to upgrade the infrastructure underpinning the DTCC's centralized Trade Information Warehouse (TIW) for over-the-counter derivatives, reducing the time it takes to clear derivatives trades from weeks (in some cases) to nearly instantaneously. To do that, the DTCC partnered with computing giant IBM, enterprise blockchain consortium R3 and venture-backed blockchain startup Axoni.  Now, with such a large-scale implementation complete, the partners are are turning their attention to testing it, and preparing it for migration of the TIW data in a compliant way.  Ahead of a scheduled launch the DTCC's chief technology architect Rob Palatnick sought to frame any obstacles ahead as a sign of progress.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The exciting thing is that there's continued comfort in the progress of the overall application and environment. There are always challenges, but we call it the 'noise of progress'.""  Side effects of ethereum  For the first time publicly, Palatnick also revealed that Axo's AxCore protocol was originally derived from the public ethereum blockchain, and that the DTCC's system uses the same Solidity smart contract language that powers its applications.  However, AxCore has been modified to include a modular consensus mechanism that lets it tailor services to the specific needs of the DTCC, as well as submit real-time reports to both regulators and other counterparties.  ""This is a huge improvement in situational awareness for individual firms, regulators and the industry as a whole,"" an Axoni representative said.  And, unlike ethereum, the DTCC implementation of AxCore does not include a token – though both Axoni and Palatnick confirmed the system is still powered by a form of ""gas,"" implying a parallel to the way transaction fees are paid on the ethereum blockchain.  While ethereum is the most-widely used blockchain protocol for developing these enterprise-grade implementations, the DTCC said complications still arose.  For one, ethereum's business logic is not as sophisticated as DTCC required – primarily in that Solidity has difficulty recognizing decimals, which was deemed necessary for the project.  Palatnick said:  ""There's lots of exceptions with everything, there's lots of nuances, and that meant things like the capabilities of the technology and the capabilities of using the smart contract language of ethereum needed to address business functionality.""  Early on, to address that, the DTCC thought much of the actual business processes workflow would need to be conducted ""off-chain,"" largely reducing the role of the blockchain itself to storing settled data. In this way, ""we wouldn't do a lot of the business logic in the smart contract language itself,"" Palatnick said.  But after several months of building, the developers discovered they were actually introducing more complexity by conducting this workflow off-chain than they were removing by using a blockchain in the first place.  ""We ended up backtracking and moving a lot more of the business logic on-chain,"" Palatnick said, noting that figuring out what information needs to go on-chain and what processes must happen off-chain was a challenge.  Moving forward  This behind-the-scenes work is scheduled to go live in the first quarter of 2018, if all goes to plan.  But before then, additional tests and a series of integrations – both with the TIW itself and external parties – need to be executed.  Currently, the DTCC is working with regulators to align Axoni's built-in reporting database with regulatory requirements. According to Palatnick, the reports have to be as good as existing ones, but will be available on a continual basis as a result of the smart contract functionality.  Additionally, the DTCC is working with R3 and its network of over 100 global financial institution members to learn from standards-making bodies how to create ""standards around what data should look like on a distributed ledger,"" he said.  Following the launch, Axoni intends to open-source the Axcore protocol.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Axoni.

42427942,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4qrh,1508490002,Cisco Seeks to Protect Blockchain System for IoT Device Tracking,"Tech conglomerate Cisco Systems has proposed a blockchain system to track Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  In an application released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday, the technology giant outlined a blockchain platform that can identify different connected devices, monitor their activity and evaluate how trustworthy the device is when connected to a network.  The system is also said to be able to automatically register and assess new devices as they are added to the network, by comparing their performance to devices already on the blockchain.  The filing specifically refers to ""low-power and lossy networks"" (LLNs), which usually run smart grid-type systems and may be composed of sensors, according to the release. Due to their environments and general design, these devices may suffer from reliability issues.  LLNs may be composed of anywhere ""from a few dozen and up to thousands or even millions of LLN routers,"" it explains. The number of LLNs is growing as well, as previously non-networked sensors and devices become increasingly connected to the internet.  As a result, the proposed system aims to improve the process by which devices are monitored, something the concept's authors say is ""key"" for the Internet of Things:  ""Particularly in the context of the IoT and similar networks, device identity and management is a key building block for a viable end-to-end solution. Depending on the particular use case, a 'thing' may have to register or authenticate its identity with different service enablers that may use various service-specific procedures.""  Automating the system using a blockchain is just one of Cisco's proposed solutions for efficiently adding devices to different networks.  Back in April, Cisco was one of several companies to announce an IoT protocol that registers devices using a blockchain-compatible application program interface, or API.

At day three of the annual financial conference, hosted by interbank messaging service Swift, Nadella provided a footnote on what was otherwise an event focused largely on collaboration between fintech startups, but which left blockchain out of the spotlight during several key addresses.  That, however, wasn't the case as the conference closed.  Following a question posed onstage by Swift CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt about whether blockchain was all it's been cracked up to be, Nadella responded definitively.  He told the audience:  ""There's real tangible progress that can be made. But, I think it's in your hands that it has to be converted into things that are very useful.""  Nadella's apparent challenge to Swift is especially nuanced as the platform that connects 11,000 of the world's banks has been conducting its own successful experiments with the technology that some say could render its service obsolete.  Elsewhere, Nadella's comments focused on Microsoft's blockchain announcements at Sibos, and the company's support of blockchain through its Azure cloud platform.  On a more personal note, though, he went so far as to reflect on his own time as a programmer at Microsoft, framing blockchain as the fulfillment of a long-held personal aspiration.  ""Ever since at least I've been in this industry, we've always looked for a distributed database with a trust harness that allows multiple organizations to collaborate, and that performs,"" he said, continuing:  ""Clearly, the blockchain and the distributed ledger that exists underneath it, I think is a very novel implementation, which I believe can have massive implications.""
