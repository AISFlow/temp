42430958,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMymph,1568058830,SEC Chair Clayton: Would-Be Bitcoin ETFs Have 'Work Left to Be Done',"The market has taken steps to address the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) concerns about approving a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), but there is still “work left to be done,” said the agency’s head.  Speaking on CNBC Monday, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said ""progress is being made"" in the crypto space to allow a bitcoin ETF to launch, though concerns linger.  In November the chairman said concerns around price manipulation were a key holdup for the financial product's green light, alongside questions such as how custody operates.  On Monday, Clayton reiterated these concerns, saying:  ""An even harder question given that they trade on largely unregulated exchanges is how can we be sure that those prices aren’t subject to significant manipulation? ... People needed to answer these hard questions for us to be comfortable that this was the appropriate kind of product.""  The SEC's questions are ""not trivial,"" Clayton added.  Critical juncture  Clayton's remarks come just weeks before the SEC is expected to approve or reject a pair of bitcoin ETF proposals.  Bitwise Asset Management, which filed one of the proposals with NYSE Arca, has published a number of reports over the past year in an effort to convince the SEC that the market is mature enough to support such a product.  VanEck/SolidX submitted the other proposal with Cboe BZX. This proposal was filed in 2018 and was seen as a strong contender to become the first bitcoin ETF approved by the SEC. However, it was withdrawn during the prolonged government shutdown of early 2019 and re-filed.  The SEC has postponed decisions on both ETF proposals but faces a final deadline of Oct. 13 for Bitwise and Oct. 18 for VanEck/SolidX.  While waiting for an ETF approval, VanEck has begun offering shares of its VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust to qualified institutional buyers using an exemption under the SEC's rules.  Though the product, announced last week, is not a retail offering (and therefore not an ETF), the shares come from the same trust on which VanEck hopes to build an ETF.

The stablecoin issuer said in a brief blog post Monday that the new token, known as CNH₮, is collateralized with yuan stored offshore.  ""CNH represents a further expansion of Tether’s capabilities in facilitating the digital use of traditional currencies, such as US dollar (USDT) and euro (EURT),"" the announcement said.  CoinDesk first reported in late August that Tether was looking to add a new stablecoin pegged to the yuan, also known as the renminbi.  At the time, over-the-counter trader (OTC) Zhao Dong, a shareholder in Tether's affiliate exchange Bitfinex, said he believed that a stablecoin backed by offshore yuan could boost the circulation of the fiat currency.  While Tether provided a smart contract address for CNH₮ Monday, it did not provide any further details about the new stablecoin. It was not immediately clear which exchanges would list the token, though Dong said in August that his company, RenrenBit, would provide support for it.  It also remains unclear where Tether will store the yuan backing the stablecoin, though Dong told CoinDesk last month that the reserves will be stored in a bank in Belgium.

42430932,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyjJh,1568044802,Stellar to Give Away 2 Billion XLM Valued at $120 Million Today,"Chat with your friends – and get paid to do it.  The Stellar Development Foundation and messaging service Keybase announced Monday a 2 billion XLM airdrop, the largest in Stellar’s five-year history, worth roughly $120 million. Over the next 20 months, Keybase users can expect monthly airdrops of 100 million XLM.  Keybase currently has 300,000 active users across its various services, according to the company.  ""All you have to do is have an authenticated Keybase account, and your XLM will appear in your wallet – automatically, every month, for as long as the airdrop continues,"" according to a draft blog post shared with CoinDesk.  Three months of airdrops are guaranteed, the company says, with the program's continuation beyond that dependent on hitting ""basic success metrics.""  The Stellar way  Stellar Development Foundation CEO Denelle Dixon tells CoinDesk that Keybase is a key part of its larger adoption strategy:  “The foundation's mandate is to deliver lumens [XLM] into the world. This is part of that plan. The up to 2 billion is a really great way. And we will have checks along the way.""  Stellar and Keybase have worked together for quite some time, beginning with a March 2018 investment from Stellar large enough to close Keybase's Series B funding round.  Dixon said the airdrop is an investment not only in Keybase users but the kind of projects the company says upholds its vision. Keybase's 300,000-strong user base shares a lot in common with crypto, Dixon said.  “The number seems much more rational when looked at over a 20-month period,” Dixon said of the airdrop. “It demonstrates that we think this is a valuable opportunity for users of Keybase to get to know us. They aren’t crypto-first.”  Social scramble  The airdrop coincides with multiple Keybase feature upgrades since its adoption of Stellar in May 2019.  On Keybase, users can send Stellar to different users and phone numbers – including those without a Keybase account – or even make inline bets with friends. A spokesperson says Keybase is adding more features in the coming months, including on- and off-ramps and XLM-based payment functionality across the web.  The airdrop partnership comes as other messaging apps ramp up their own cryptocurrency efforts.  Telegram  , which claims to serve some 300 million users, plans on launching its hotly anticipated Telegram Open Network (TON) next month. As of now, multiple methods of sending cryptocurrencies already exist on the application as well through independent development.  Facebook, of course, is also in the mix. The company's WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger services dwarf Telegram’s user count with some 2.7 billion potential users. An early goal for Libra is that the stablecoin will be compatible with Facebook-owned messaging platforms.  Keybase, it would seem, is taking a lesson from Twitter: working with an existing cryptocurrency instead of developing one in house.  ""Keybase believes Stellar can fulfill bitcoin's original goal of fast, cheap, worldwide payments,"" said a Stellar spokesperson.

42430927,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyjBh,1568043036,Tim Draper Joins Board of EOS-Based Messaging Dapp MakeSense,"Venture capitalist Tim Draper, an early investor in Tesla, Skype, and Baidu, has joined the board of MakeSense Labs, the provider of a messaging app built on the EOS blockchain.  Announced Monday, the appointment follows the August launch of the startup's Sense.Chat on iOS and Android.  Since 2014, Draper has made headlines through his active investments in the crypto industry, including leading financing rounds in Coinbase and Ledger, and purchasing 30,000 bitcoin at a government auction. In October 2014, Draper predicted bitcoin would rise in price to $10,000 within three years. (It took two months longer than that to happen.)  “We are very excited to have Tim’s support and advice. He’s been a massively important and pivotal figure in technology, and recently in the blockchain. He’s everything we want to emulate in our leadership – he’s creative, supportive, and passionate,” said Ben Sigman, CTO of Sense.Chat.  Sense.Chat allows EOS accounts to message and send funds to one another on mobile devices, without having a counterparty’s phone number or email address. The messages remain private and secure through public-key encryption.  “The world is becoming decentralized. I am excited to support this amazing application. Sense.Chat improves human connections by allowing private, seamless messaging and payments,” Draper said in the announcement.  Draper previously staked an undisclosed amount in Make.Sense Labs' parent company, Sensay, through his venture capital firm Draper Associates.  He also serves as headmaster at Draper University, a school for entrepreneurship.

World Bank research field coordinator Erick Baumgartner told CoinDesk he went to three high schools in the crime-riddled Pavuna district to recruit students for the nine-month program, which started in May.  “Even for classes that are happening right outside their houses, we’ve already had two days when they couldn’t come to class because of police operations,” Baumgartner said. “When shooting starts, people can’t go out of their houses.”  In order to serve this marginalized community of aspiring developers, the World Bank partnered with a slew of organizations ranging from MakerDAO to Banco Maré and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, plus the Brazilian education startup Blockchain Academy.  Only half of the students passed the computer literacy test to take the blockchain-focused course at the end of the program. They’ll be learning web programming basics, how to make ethereum-based smart contracts and a little about Hyperledger.  “The final purpose of all these efforts is to give them a real opportunity to be hired,” Blockchain Academy co-founder Rosine Kadamani told CoinDesk. “By the end of the training program, students are going to participate in a hackathon with MakerDAO, to have the opportunity to create something more concrete, something that could be helpful for themselves.”  DeFi-lanthropy  MakerDAO says its goals for the program are altruistic. Nadia Alvarez, MakerDAO’s head of business development in Latin America, told CoinDesk she hopes students learn about “solutions” beyond banks and traditional financial institutions.  “What we want is to give them information to develop their curiosity around the blockchain and other financial options they have,” she said.  Kadamani added that the program offers a well-rounded education, including the risks of decentralized finance (DeFi), so that students can decide for themselves whether crypto loans suit their specific needs.  As for the students themselves, 17-year-old Luiz Felipe Rangel Silva told CoinDesk that although his family has a bank account they mostly use cash. Concepts like blockchain and payment apps are foreign to him, beyond brief mentions of bitcoin he heard on the news.  “I’m always interested in learning and being better prepared [for jobs], also learning how to make websites and software,” he told CoinDesk, adding that students were restricted from using the computer lab at his school, to curtail theft. This will be his first programming course.  MakerDAO’s Alvarez and the World Bank’s Baumgartner both referred to this program as a pilot, which they hope to expand next year if participant feedback proves it helped them gain job opportunities. Kadamani, of Blockchain Academy, noted the program is still seeking crypto-industry partnerships, with companies looking to hire or to contribute to the curriculum.  Speaking of why MakerDAO sponsored the program, Alvarez concluded:  “It’s an incredible opportunity to create new solutions thinking of the actual needs of people in different countries.”  Class photo image via World Bank",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | MKR,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/09/09/makerdao-is-helping-60-kids-in-brazil-learn-the-basics-of-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8656664702808bfc77a2f6faa1eb83d265aa4766-1400x681.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430935,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyjNh,1568034052,Netki Retools Digital ID Service for FATF's New Crypto 'Travel Rule',"Netki has upgraded its digital identity service to help cryptocurrency firms meet tough new international standards for combating money laundering.  Announced Monday, the upgrade to TransactID adds two new features: The ability to break down certificates of a user's identity into smaller pieces of personally identifiable information (PII); and the ability for senders and receivers of money to request PII from each other.  ""Before, there was, like, one large, atomic transaction where each side shared all of the information about each other with each other,"" Justin Newton, CEO of Netki, told CoinDesk. ""Now the protocol allows for more of a conversation where each side can request and share individual pieces of identity information with each other.""  The change comes in response to recommendations released in June by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental body devoted to fighting money laundering and terrorism financing. They require “virtual asset service providers” (VASPs), including crypto exchanges, to pass information about their customers to one another when transferring funds between firms so law enforcement has an information trail.  While FATF standards aren't binding, its 37 member countries are expected to put them into practice through regulation or legislation, and the organization gave them 12 months to do so.  Indeed, even before the FATF guidance dropped, the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), stated that the ""travel rule"" already applied to crypto exchanges, just as it long has for other financial institutions.  TransactID was originally designed primarily with the U.S. in mind, but now that FATF has applied the travel rule to crypto, Netki has made the product customizable to account for differences in how countries interpret the guidance.  For example, the Swiss regulator FINMA last month extended this requirement to transactions between regulated exchanges and unregulated, personal wallets, going further than other countries that only applied it to exchange-to-exchange transfers.  FinCEN crackdown?  Even in the U.S., Netki claims there's now a stronger impetus to comply. ""Recently, the U.S. FinCEN agency has begun enforcement actions against VASPs who are not in compliance,"" it said in a press release. (FinCEN has not announced any crypto-related enforcement actions since April.)  “There have been a couple of meetings that I've been at that were around the FATF guidance and travel rule where lawyers from the top firms representing companies in this space have said that they have multiple clients that are undergoing FinCEN enforcement actions related to the Travel Rule,"" Newton said.  TransactID uses open-source standards that encrypt peer-to-peer exchange of identity information between parties before transacting. Netki claims its technology can do this while maintaining the integrity of the blockchain on which transactions take place.  Specifically, TransactID uses X.509 certificates, a standard commonly used for validating ownership of websites, to exchange identity information. Netki says it picked the decades-old standard because it's widely recognized by governmental and regulatory agencies as a legally valid form of identification.  Since the certificates are used in Netki's solution to identify the sender and receiver in a transaction, VASPs don’t need to establish a relationship with either party, the company says.  For companies that use Netki for their know-your-customer (KYC) process, certificates cost around $1 per user or less, Newton said.  The service is also built on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 75, developed by Netki and wallet provider Breadwallet in 2016. BIP 75 is a peer-to-peer protocol, based on open standards, available for anyone to use and compatible with custodial and non-custodial wallets.

The firm said Monday it has now ""soft closed"" its Nickel Arbitrage Fund to new investors, two months after launch. The raise was joined by funds of funds and family offices in the U.K., Europe, North America and Singapore.  Regulated  by the Financial Conduct Authority, the firm says the arbitrage fund strategy ""harnesses the extreme swings in crypto markets to deliver low-volatility, consistent performance.""  Nickel has built its own automated trading systems. By investing in only those digital assets that have active futures and swap markets, it maintains ""an overall market-neutral exposure to volatile crypto-assets,"" according to a press release  “As long as digital assets and their derivatives trade on multiple exchanges across the globe, with sufficient speed and execution quality, we can profitably make markets, while improving liquidity for other market participants,” said Alek Kloda, portfolio manager at Nickel.  Nickel also said it offers a solution for managing digital assets on multiple trading platforms.  ""Until now, hedge funds have been using a self-custody model for digital assets. Since blockchain transactions are irreversible, the risk of a single point of failure has been the key reason for institutional investors avoiding exposure to the asset class at any significant scale,"" Nickel said. The firm is employing multi-signature security to ensure no single party can move funds individually, and restricts movement of funds to a pre-approved white list of addresses.  Anatoly Crachilov, Nickel Asset Management CEO, said:  “Our vision is that it’s simply a matter of time until digital assets become part of institutional portfolio allocation for forward-looking investors around the world, and we aim to build an institutional-quality gateway to this high-octane world of digital assets.”  Nickel said the fund may reopen to investors for a limited period later this year as its service reaches full capacity.

42430945,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyjhh,1568026824,Bitcoin Price Faces Drop to Support Levels Below $10K,"View  Bitcoin risks falling below $10,000 this week, having confirmed a high-volume bearish reversal on the daily chart on Friday.  A break below $10,000 would expose key support levels lined up at $9,755 and $9,320.  The bearish case would weaken if the cryptocurrency rises above $10,350 today, confirming a wedge breakout on the hourly chart.  A UTC close above $10,956 (Aug. 20 high as per Bitstamp data) is needed to revive the bullish outlook.      Bitcoin (BTC) is losing altitude and may slide further toward $9,750 this week unless prices invalidate a bearish technical setup with a move above $10,350 in the next few hours.  The top cryptocurrency fell to $10,060 at 08:10 UTC, the lowest level since Sept. 2, according to Bitstamp data.  BTC hit the one-week low two days after facing strong rejection near key resistance. On Friday, the cryptocurrency fell sharply to $10,200 with strong volumes shortly after facing rejection near $10,956 – a bearish lower high created on Aug. 20.  Friday's drop marked a victory for the bears in an ongoing tug of war with the bulls represented by Wednesday's ""spinning top"" candle.  Essentially, the market turned bearish with Friday's drop and the negative follow through seen today has further strengthened the case for retest of key support levels lined up below $10,000.  Even so, sellers need to observe caution, as the pullback from highs near $10,956 has taken the shape of a bullish reversal on the intraday charts.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,240 on Bitstamp, representing a 3 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Daily and hourly charts  BTC fell 4 percent on Friday (above left), engulfing the price action seen in the preceding three days.  More importantly, prices closed (UTC) well below $10,378 on Friday, validating the seller exhaustion signaled by Wednesday's spinning top candle and Thursday's doji candle.  In the following two days, prices traded in the range of $10,200–$10,400 before falling to lows below $10,100 earlier today, marking a continuation of Friday's sell-off.  Now, the path of least resistance is to the downside, according to the daily chart. Prices could soon challenge support at $9,755 – the low of the Aug. 22 doji candle. A violation there would expose the recent low of $9,320 (Aug. 29 low).  The bearish case, however, would weaken if prices break higher from the falling wedge pattern seen on the hourly chart (above right). As of writing, the upper edge of the falling wedge is located at $10,350.  A falling wedge comprises converging trendlines connecting lower highs and lower lows. The converging nature of the trendlines indicates the bearish momentum is running out of steam. Hence, a breakout is widely taken as a sign of bullish reversal.  However, in this case, the wedge breakout, if confirmed, would only weaken the prospects of a slide below $10,000. The outlook would turn bullish only if prices print a UTC close above $10,956 (Aug. 20 high).  That would invalidate the bearish lower-highs setup on the daily chart. Note that longer time frame charts take precedence over the hourly and other intraday charts, as per technical analysis theory.

The ""self-sovereign"" system, the government says, will use apps on mobile devices or or computers to allow citizens to ""create and manage their own identities, with full legal effectiveness and privacy.""  As an example, a user may use the ID system to verify they are of legal age without having to provide either the date or the place of birth.  IdentiCAT will be developed to align with the 2014 EU's elDAS rules on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions. As such, IdentiCAT users will be able to access online services and carry out electronic transactions in any EU member state, the press release indicates.  The first stage in getting the system up and running will involve the tender of development of the underlying technology, including tools for generating self-sovereign IDs, software that will validate and authenticate the IDs, and a way to technically integrate IdentiCAT with authentication systems currently used by the authorities within the Catalan Open Government Consortium.  Once development is complete, IdentiCAT will be deployed and distributed for use by Catalan citizens, public organizations and companies.

42430934,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyjLh,1568019057,MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito Steps Down Over Epstein Financing,"Joichi Ito, head of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has resigned after it was revealed that he and other Media Lab staff had attempted to conceal financial contributions from convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  The New Yorker  reported last Friday that Ito and MIT Media lab – which hosts a number of innovation programs including a Digital Currency Initiative – had accepted donations from Epstein even though the financier was on the university's ""disqualified"" donors list and attempted to keep the source of the funds a secret.  Ito had disclosed last Wednesday that he had accepted $525,000 from Epstein for the lab, as well as $1.2 million for his investment funds.  However, the New Yorker published MIT emails sent by Ito that appear to illustrate how he had attempted to veil the donations from the university and the public.  After Epstein funded a researcher at the lab, Ito penned one message that said: “Make sure this gets accounted for as anonymous.”  Reportedly, the fact that the links to Epstein were widely known in the lab and he was known as Harry Potter villain Voldemort, ""he must not be named,"" among staff.  Epstein had also allegedly encouraged other notable figures to back the lab, including Bill Gates and investor Leon Black. When Gates made a $2 million contribution, Peter Cohen, the lab's then Director of Development and Strategy reportedly said in an MIT email:  “This is a $2M gift from Bill Gates directed by Jeffrey Epstein For gift recording purposes, we will not be mentioning Jeffrey’s name as the impetus for this gift.”  A spokesperson for Gates denied that Epstein had a role in directing any funding by the Microsoft billionaire.  Ito resigned from his role at MIT a day after the New Yorker report. MIT President L. Rafael Reif said in a message to the MIT community:  “Because the accusations in the story are extremely serious, they demand an immediate, thorough and independent investigation. This morning, I asked MIT’s General Counsel to engage a prominent law firm to design and conduct this process.”  Ito is also reported by the New York Times as having stepped down from positions at the MacArthur Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and The New York Times Company, as well as a visiting professorship at Harvard.  It's not yet clear if the scandal will affect the operations of lab's various programs, including the Digital Currency Initiative.
