42397693,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrDZ,1402956327,How Block Chain Technology Could Usher in Digital Democracy,"In the digital age, it seems strange that people all around the world still use paper to vote. Of course, given bitcoin's promise to remove paper from the financial system, many in the industry are beginning to ask if the same block chain technology can be applied to help modernize the democratic process.  There's good reason, as the traditional paper voting system has its flaws. In 2012, when the last US election occurred, one in every eighthttp://www.pewstates.org/uploadedFiles/PCS_Assets/2012/Pew_Upgrading_Voter_Registration.pdf voter registrations was invalid or inaccurate, and 2.7 million voters were registered in multiple states. That’s a terrible statistic in a system used to decide the future of any nation, let alone one as powerful as the US.  Some might argue that the paper voting system could use a little digital efficiency. Internet voting might not only be more accurate, but it could also be more frequent. Organising a paper-based vote on monthly issues would be impractical, but voting from your tablet or mobile phone on, say, whether to allow your local MP or senator to continue in their role might encourage a little more accountability in the seat of power.  Forget it, says Barbara Simons. ""At this point we cannot do Internet voting securely,"" warns the former IBM computer scientist who has conducted extensive research into Internet voting. Readers will point out that Internet voting is already happening, but she's saying that we cannot guarantee its integrity.  Simons, a former president of the Association for Computing Machinery, participated in a National Workshop on Internet Voting commissioned by former US President Bill Clinton, and authored a book, 'Broken Ballots'. She is a long-standing critic of online voting, and her research caused the US Department of Defense to nix an Internet voting system it was considering.  ""A lot of people think ‘I can bank online, so why can’t I vote online?’,"" says Simons. ""But, millions disappear from online bank accounts each year.""  There are several challenges facing Internet voting systems. One of the biggest is auditability. How can you prove that a vote was cast the proper way?  Sending your vote from a kiosk, mobile phone or home computer to a server - or even selecting options using an automated phone-based voting system - doesn’t guarantee that it gets registered properly at the other end, or even registered at all. The voter doesn’t have access to that server, or to the network along which their vote travels. And when it comes to a recount, there is no paper trail.  ""The beauty of paper ballots is that you can do recounts,"" says Simons.  Some are mulling block chain-based systems to help solve the tangled problem of Internet voting. Block chains are already used to encode information from - and about - a particular source, made at a particular point of time.  Blocks in a block chain are ‘sealed’ with a cryptographic hash, which can be used to verify the contents of that block at a later date. If anyone tries to alter the historical record of transactions in a network, or to introduce new ones, then they’d have to go back and alter that block in the block chain. That would create a new hash that wouldn’t match the existing hash on record for that block.  The fraudster could simply replace that hash with a new one, but it takes a lot of computing power to calculate a hash on the bitcoin network. And the hash for a bitcoin block is used to help compute the hash of the next block in the block chain. That means that the further back in time you try to alter a transaction, the more hashes you’d have to recalculate, and the more computing power it would take.  Voting on the block chain  That is how bitcoin is able to guarantee its validity as a public ledger for all transactions in its history. But, if you can do that for financial transactions, the argument goes, then why can’t you do it for votes? After all, votes are another kind of transaction that has to be recorded. The Liberal Alliance party in Denmark is said to be in favour of a block chain-based vote.  BitCongress  is using the Ethereum platform to build a scrypt-based altcoin called votecoin, that will use its network to hash and verify votes. It will use an application, Axiomity, both to organise and decide the parameters for votes, and to handle the voting process, explains founder Morgan Rockwell, who is also behind Bitcoin Kinetics.  Rockwell told CoinDesk:  ""The numbers that detail the cryptocurrency component, the voting methods, the GUI for Axiomity all are being set up to allow custom implementation of votecoin for multiple case uses.""  He added that votes will be hashed into a block chain.  Compromised machines  A block chain-based system might provide a useful way to prove that a particular vote was cast by someone with a specific private key, and thereby guarantee the integrity of the votes once they were cast. But, what about guaranteeing the integrity of the voting process itself?  The big problem with Internet-based voting software, experts say, is that it’s difficult to prove that the voting machines themselves have not been compromised.  ""If we're doing remote internet voting on the voters own machines, then we need some assurance that those machines aren't owned,"" says Christopher Camp, founder of Restart Democracy, a nonprofit organization focused on driving innovations in technology to help promote democracy.  Camp explained:  ""There is no simple solution. The rate of tech geeks who are having bitcoin lifted off them is a sign that this is a deep problem. And bitcoin owners are people who likely have decent security hygiene and high-entropy passwords.""  How might a client-side compromise work? Let's say that Bob is about to vote on the next president. Bob is using a PC-based system, with open-source code that anyone can inspect and the machine is under his control. Bob uses biometric authentication to prove to the voting program that he is who he says he is.  Bob then enters his private key - securely stored on a piece of paper in a locked safe - to access his votecoin and cast his vote. Using the public key, he votes for Jane to be president.  So far, so good. But, a rookit installed by Jane's opponent Mike via a drive-by download has altered the software’s functionality. The software uses Bob's carefully-validated ID to alter the vote. That vote, fully authenticated, is then hashed into the block chain for posterity - as a vote for Mike.  This is not far fetched. Similar things happen in banking all the time, says Simons:  ""Malware is put on the victims' machines, and malware steals money from the victim’s bank accounts without their knowledge. There’s a famous virus called Zeus that has stolen millions of dollars from online bank accounts.""  Zeus  does that by waiting for the victim to authenticate themselves to the bank, and then carrying out its own actions using that authentication.  But, surely the same software used to vote could scan the block chain and double-check that Mike’s vote was cast correctly? Perhaps. But then, if the software is running on a compromised machine and has been altered to tamper with a vote, then it isn’t to be trusted. Banking trojans also rewrite bank statements to fool users, after all.  Rockwell doesn’t have an easy answer for this.  ""The reality is that problem cannot be easily solved by any electronic method,"" he says. ""BitCongress is not being created to replace all forms of voting; it is merely for a simple block chain-based option to give a public ledger of votes to the public eye.""  Steps toward solutions  Some have tried to solve these problems using end-to-end auditable voting systems, which at least try to facilitate electronic voting, if not Internet voting.  Typically, votes are made via a kiosk, which produces some kind of paper record of the ballot, but they allow votes to be processed electronically rather than hand-counted, for efficiency and expediency. An E2E verificable system will typically cryptographically encode the physical ballots somehow, so that a later audit can be conducted if necessary to match the paper ballot with the registered vote.  Scantegrity  , a system used to cryptographically verify optical voting records, tries to solve the problem of verifying physical ballot validity by including a cryptographic code printed on the voting ballot. Auditors can use the cryptographic code later on to check that the vote registered on the system corresponded with the vote on the ballot.  But, Scantegrity relies heavily on data registered before an election (such as unique codes that can be used by voters, for example). What if an election official added more codes to the list of allowable voting codes, and then 'stuffed the ballot' to make new, fake votes?  Jeremy Clark  of Carleton University and Aleks Essex at the University of Waterloo hope to use block chains to solve that problem. They published a paper describing commitcoin. This is an implementation of a system that uses cryptographic proof of work systems to prove that they committed a message before a certain date.  The pair have suggested that this system could be used not to manage an entire voting system, but rather to prove the integrity of election data (such as a list of valid voting codes) before an event. That way, if someone tried to add more voting codes, it could be compared with the original, verifiable list.  A hybrid approach  Clark has also worked on a remote voting system known as Remotegrity. This allows voters to use the Internet, though it relies on the postal system as a side channel. Voters can’t rely entirely on the voting system, but must instead receive lists of candidates via the mail.  The candidates are represented by numbers, randomised across different mailings and they use these numbers when voting on the Internet. That prevents a compromised computer from changing their vote.  Clark explained:  ""I think the long term solution is to marry a modified version of Remotegrity with the block chain, so that you end up with a Distributed Autonomous version of Remotegrity.""  The block chain may be a useful means of guaranteeing vote integrity at the back end, but as these experts point out, guaranteeing vote integrity from end to end is a sticky problem - especially if you’re trying to make push-button democracy a reality.  On the other hand, in an electoral system where a quarter of eligible US voters aren’t even registered, rootkits are one problem in a constellation of democracy-threatening issues.

42395334,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaLkK,1402948815,Why Bitcoin is the Petroleum of Our Time,"Tuur Demeester is an independent investor and newsletter writer. He has a background in Austrian economics, the school that specialises in the study of boom-and-bust cycles in the economy. Here, he compares bitcoin's disruptive potential in traditional finance to petroleum's shakeup of the whale oil industry in the 19th century.  Today, I want to tell you the story of Charles W Morgan.  Mr Morgan lived in the United States during the early 19th century and was a successful entrepreneur and investor. He was active in the energy market. Or, as it was better known in the day: whale hunting.  It’s no exaggeration to say that at the time, the whole world was lit by whale oil. It fuelled most of the oil lamps. It was also used to produce the superior spermaceti candles – sturdier candles that burned brighter and with less smell than those from animal fat or beeswax.  We can still trace the dominance of the whale oil candles via the candela, widely used base unit for luminous intensity, which was originally based on the brightness of a single spermaceti candle.  When Charles Morgan got involved in whaling, it was an industry that had been growing for over five decades. It being very lucrative, the government had gotten involved decades ago and regulated most of the important aspects of whaling; it was a highly regulated industry.  Over time, Morgan built a fleet of seven whaling ships. In 1841, at the height of the whaling industry’s success, he launched an eighth, a 351-ton wooden ship named after – who else – himself.  However, a couple of years later Morgan started to notice the whaling space getting overcrowded – the competition was staggering. He also discovered that whale populations were in decline, making it more expensive to find and catch the deep-sea mammals.  Thus, in 1847 he decided to start selling his whaling ships and diversified into other sectors, such as mining, railroad construction, and banking.  Decline of the whaling industry  Morgan timed his decisions just right, because in 1849 a Canadian geologist distilled an oily substance out of bituminous tar, which he called kerosene. It didn’t take long before the world market switched from lighting their homes with whale oil lamps, to much cheaper kerosene lamps.  And in the 1850s, the invention of paraffin, a distillate from petroleum, dealt a devastating blow to the demand for the spermaceti from whales. (Electric light only was invented in 1880.)  After decades of strong growth and dominance, the age of whaling pretty much ended in the span of a couple years.  What did the whalers do?  This of course did not mean that all whalers went bankrupt outright. A not insubstantial number of them saw opportunity in the upcoming petroleum industry. Actually, there were quite a few parallels between the two sectors:  Both industries had booms and busts  Whalers were familiar with the phenomenon of depletion  Prospecting for oil was arduous and adventurous in whaling as well as in petroleum  Petroleum had to be refined with a chemical process, just like whale oil  And so it’s no surprise that historian Samuel John Mills Eaton made the following comment in 1866:  “Many of the old whalemen have thrown aside the tarpaulin and harpoon, and have entered upon the business of selecting [petroleum] sites and locating wells with as much avidity as ever they pursued the monsters of the deep.”  Revolution then, revolution now  Today my friends, we are seeing history repeat itself. The old industry of money and banking on the one hand, and brand new monetary technology on the other. Here are some parallels with the 19th century petroleum revolution:  1. The fiat banking industry, intertwined with central banking, has been growing quickly for over five decades, is heavily regulated and has been in a worldwide state of crisis since 2008.  2. Bankers today are also on a hunt for a rare find: yield. Making a return on investment in an environment of ever-increasing inflation and central bank interventions is a risky endeavour, perhaps akin to Captain Ahab hunting for a white whale named Moby Dick.  3. Technologies with vastly higher efficiencies are making waves and are growing at blistering speeds. To illustrate: a couple months ago, a $100m Bitcoin transaction was made, and it:  Cleared in a matter of seconds  Did not make use of any middlemen  Had zero transaction costs  Respected the privacy of the participants  Happened on a sunday  Vastly higher efficiency indeed.  4. Just like with petroleum in the 19th century, the challenger of the status quo:  Is an unlikely contender  Has no support from establishment intellectuals  Is associated with scams and fraud  Is a volatile sector, with violent price swings and spectacular bankruptcies  Features both horrible and super high quality products ('standard oil' was named such to indicate a certain standard in quality)  In other words, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs are operating in a wild west environment, just like in the early days of petroleum.  5. Cryptocurrency companies are beginning to snatch away the brightest minds in banking.  Just like the whale oil and petroleum industries had similarities, both the bitcoin and the legacy banking industries are dealing with digital currencies – so there are obvious opportunities for bankers who want to create value in the new economy.  Are these intriguing parallels showing us the way forward for the world of money and banking? Are they showing us that Bitcoin is bound to become the new world reserve currency?  We cannot know for sure, but what they do tell us loud and clear is this: don’t take the status quo for granted.  Challenges and opportunities going forward  Let me close with a couple of thoughts on what the challenge and opportunity is here.  Basically what we see is that the upcoming cryptographic technologies have taken the game of money and banking to a new level. The old rules apply to an ever smaller extent.  Here is what customers will increasingly demand going forward:  Control & flexibility: just like Steve Jobs set a new standard with his '1000 songs in my pocket' iPod, customers will not be satisfied with less than 'a bank in my pocket'  Deposit banking with high transparency: now that verifiable reserve audits are a possibility, they will grow out to become the new standard  Lending and borrowing brokerage as a separate service. In the absence of a central bank to bail out deposit banks, there is no benefit to increasing the risk of fraud and insolvency by blending these two traditionally independent industries. This is what we already see in bitcoin today  100% predictable monetary policy: men with beards uttering greenspeak don’t cut it anymore, people will want financial systems where they don’t have to trust a secretive, centralised institution  Finally people will demand antifragility: they won’t accept a central point of failure. Sure, maybe today they do still, but after the next big banking crisis many of them will change their minds  This is the new reality we live in.  And what an opportunity it represents. For the first time in history, we are able to build a robust and low cost financial system from which the entire world can benefit.  And what an opportunity for the Netherlands. Bitcoin adoption is among the highest in the world right here, and there’s a wealth of entrepreneurial knowledge and creativity ready to take things to the next level.  All the knowledge is present to make this place into the Silicon Valley of money 2.0, into the Hong Kong of 21st century banking.  Just like the Bank of Amsterdam was central for the Dutch golden century, cryptocurrency could be key for a new era of prosperity here in the low lands. So let us not be afraid of this revolution, but instead embrace it.

42397694,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrEY,1402945611,Ghash.io: We Will Never Launch a 51% Attack Against Bitcoin,"CEX.IO, the operating exchange for the largest bitcoin mining pool Ghash.io, has issued a new statement to address community concerns regarding the growing amount of the pool's bitcoin network hashing power.  The post marks the first time since Ghash.io began rapidly approaching 50% of the network's hashing power that CEX.IO has issued a statement on the mining pool's growing size and influence over bitcoin's core infrastructure.  Should Ghash.io reach and maintain 51% of the bitcoin network, the mining pool would theoretically be able to perform certain actions uncontested, such as double spending individual bitcoins, preventing transaction confirmations and obstructing other miners and mining pools from profiting from valid blocks.  Issued via CEX.IO's website, the pool operator reaffirmed its commitment to the bitcoin ecosystem, stating:  ""Our investment, participation and highly motivated staff confirm it is our intention to help protect and grow the broad acceptance of bitcoin and categorically in no way harm or damage it. We never have and never will participate in any 51% attack or double spend against bitcoin.""  Notably, however, CEX.IO also indicated that it is against ""temporary solutions"" to reducing the threat of a 51% attack, suggesting that should it embrace this type of solution, the underlying problem in the bitcoin network would not be removed.  CEX.IO added: ""It also does not address the core issue only pushing the problem a few weeks or months down the road when another pool or perhaps GHash.IO again grows towards 51%"".  To guard against this threat, CEX.IO is proposing a summit of leading mining pools and the Bitcoin Foundation that will aim to collectively address the issue of 51% attacks.  At press time, Ghash.io accounted for 31% of bitcoin's total hash rate, according to Blockchain.  Mining pool summit  Though details were scant, CEX.IO indicated it is in the process of contacting other leading mining pools and the Bitcoin Foundation, the industry's leading trade group, to hold a meeting on the issue of 51% attacks.  CEX.IO described the event as a ""‘round table’ meeting of the key players, with the aim of discussing and negotiating collectively ways to address the decentralisation of mining as an industry"".  The meeting could happen as soon as 10th-11th July, at the CoinSummit Conference in London, which will unite bitcoin industry leaders such as angel investor Roger Ver, BitGo CEO Will O’Brien and MaidSafe head David Irvine with payments experts such as Stripe’s Greg Brockman.  Limiting competition  CEX.IO took aim at its detractors who have suggested that the bitcoin ecosystem could benefit from it taking more immediate steps to discourage miners from joining the pool.  Framing this argument as one that is against the values of fair competition and innovation, the company said:  ""In any market, competition and innovation drives growth and that is particularly true in an emerging and disruptive environment such as bitcoin. Successful and innovative companies cannot be expected to limit their growth or competitiveness as a direct result of their success.""  Still, some in the industry have attempted to address the issue in time with recent community concerns.  For example, the news follows the 13th June announcement by industrial mining facility operator BitFury that it would pull more than 1PH/s of mining power from the pool over such concerns.  Community reaction  Reaction to the proposed plan was immediately vibrant on reddit, with detractors and proponents both sounding off on the latest development in what has become a highly publicized issue for bitcoin.  The news of bitcoin's latest perceived vulnerability was quickly seized by a litany of major news publications including The Guardian, TechCrunch and Ars Technica, among others.  Still, there remains a debate in the bitcoin community regarding the viability of such an attack, with experts aligning on both sides of the issue. The problem may be best summed up by Princeton professor and industry observer Ed Fenton who acknowledged the theoretical dangers of a 51% attack as well as its more practical considerations, stating:  ""Concentration of mining power might not be a short-term disaster, but it is unhealthy for bitcoin, and the community needs to address it.""

42397690,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrBb,1402939818,$30 Billion Online Merchant Processor Digital River Adds Bitcoin Payments,"UPDATE (18th June 15:00 BST): Updated to include information on Digital River's bitcoin pricing policy.      Commerce-as-a-service solutions provider Digital River – a company that processed more than $30bn in online transactions in 2013, has announced that it has added bitcoin as a payment option for its online merchants.  The offering is now available to merchants using the Minnesota-based company's SWREG solution for small and mid-sized businesses.  Notably, Digital River said it is seeking to allow customers to take advantage of the savings bitcoin can bring to international transactions, indicating it now sees bitcoin as one of a number of competing options for this use.  The company stated:  ""Bitcoin will now be available along with other international payment options, such as credit and debit cards, wire transfers, bank transfers and third-party wallets.""  Founded in 1994, Digital River is one of the first more traditional online payments businesses to embrace bitcoin. In addition to facilitating e-commerce, Digital River also offers site design, development, web store hosting, order management and fraud prevention, in addition to a list of other services.  Digital River clients include personal computer accessory specialist Logitech, subscription music streaming service Spotify, Internet security software provider Trend Micro and game developer Ubisoft, among others.  The formal partnership with California-based bitcoin merchant processor Coinbase follows Digital River's January announcement that it would seek to integrate bitcoin payments into its product offerings in 2014.  Bitcoin a 'game-changer'  Speaking to The Wall Street Journal, Souheil Badran, vice president and general manager at Digital River, indicated that he believes bitcoin is more than just a fad, and that his company's decision to accept the digital currency is a validation of this sentiment.  Badran told the media outlet:  “We see it as something that is here to stay, even if people are seeing it as just a payment method in general. But for me it is a game-changer.”  SWREG was previously the product of an independent, Minnesota-based payment processing company of the same name. It was purchased in 2005 and now operates as a subsidiary of Digital River, according to Businessweek.  Avoiding volatility  Tom Peterson, executive vice president and general manager of commerce at Digital River, said that the decision will allow its customers to access the benefits of bitcoin without the risks of some of its more well-known drawbacks.  For example, Peterson noted that merchants who have been eager to test out bitcoin payments can now avoid the currency's price volatility through Digital River, stating:  ""This business model creates an opportunity for our customers to offer payment solutions that may be in earlier stages of adoption in their domestic markets.""  Fee pricing unknown  Notably, at press time, Digital River did not provide information on any fees it would charge merchants for accepting bitcoin transactions through its offerings.  Other merchant-focused e-commerce solutions – such as those provided by Square and Stripe – have drawn criticism from the bitcoin community for charging merchant fees comparable to traditional payment products for bitcoin services.  A spokesperson for Digital River later confirmed that its pricing policy will not differ from other payment options, saying:  ""There is no separate pricing for bitcoin. Bitcoin is being offered just like any other payment option through our small to mid-sized commerce solution.""  According to the company's SWREG pricing charthttps://www.mycommerce.com/swreg/pricing, Digital River offers merchants two plans, meaning they could be charged 2.9% of each transaction plus $1 or 0% of each purchase plus $.99 depending on their choice of enrollment.

42397704,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrKS,1402935726,Multi-Sig Bitcoin Wallet Provider BitGo Raises $12 Million,"Bitcoin-focused security-as-a-service provider BitGo has secured $12m in new funding courtesy of several venture capitalists, seasoned bitcoin investors and a famed Hollywood A-lister.  The funding round was led by VC firm Redpoint Ventures and it attracted Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Opportunity Corporation, Radar Partners, Liberty City Ventures, Crypto Currency Partners and Ashton Kutcher’s A-Grade Investments.  Speaking to CoinDesk, BitGo CEO Will O’Brien framed the successful funding round as being about ""more than capital"", telling CoinDesk:  ""The folks that we’ve brought on [are] people like Stratton Sclavos, former CEO of VeriSign, and industry influencers like Barry Silbert. [...] We’re putting together a company that Fortune 500 [firms] and the largest hedge funds can trust as their bitcoin security platform.""  O’Brien added: ""This capital is about team, building a trusted brand and scaling globally"".  The news follows BitGo's recent addition of former Facebook employee Ben Davenport, who joined the company as head of product and co-founder in May.  Fortune 500 quality  O'Brien told CoinDesk that the funding would help improve BitGo's position and bring enterprise bitcoin security to a whole new level, saying:  ""Bitcoin is obviously still in its early innings, and we feel fundamentally that security is a threat to bitcoin adoption, and as an industry we need to solve this problem.""  O'Brien added that the company has been focused on security ""from day one"", when his team came to market with the first multi-sig wallet in August 2013. The company has since focused efforts around building a robust platform that can enable businesses and financial institutions to securely store and transact in bitcoin.  The CEO likened the progress of his business to early Internet trailblazers who helped pave the way for e-commerce, stating:  ""If you go back to the early days of the internet, it wasn't safe for you to put your credit card on a website, and companies like VeriSign came to market and enabled the growth of the Internet today. There's a lot of DIY and experimentation and we need to quickly move toward standards and robust security platforms.”  Security and celebrity talent  BitGo used the opportunity to announce that it has new board members, including former VeriSign CEO Stratton Sclavos and Jeff Brody of Redpoint Ventures.  VeriSign  is a hugely successful e-commerce platform that has become a de-facto Internet standard. Further, Brody was one of Redpoint’s founding members and he was ranked 19th on the Forbes Midas List of tech’s top investors.    As for Hollywood talent, Ashton Kutcher is also on board.      Kutcher is no stranger to the world of bitcoin, as he was also an early investor in bitcoin merchant payments processor BitPay.    Banking on multi-sig security  BitGo  describes itself as a leading bitcoin security platform that offers multi-sig security-as-a-service, and claims to provide the industry’s most secure online bitcoin wallet and enterprise solutions for corporate users.  The company says its investors include elite Silicon Valley angels and venture capitalists who have backed successful companies in the past, such as PayPal, Tesla, Twitter and Yammer.  Emphasizing enterprise-grade security, BitGo aims to offer institutional investors the opportunity to store bitcoin in online wallets and access their holdings on short notice.  As the above diagram shows, the BitGo platform uses three keys to bolster security. One is held by the user, encrypted in their browser. The second is generated by BitGo and stored on its servers. Finally, the third key (or the cold key) is generated offline, and it is only used for disaster recovery in case one of the other two keys is lost or compromised.  In a transaction, BitGo acts as a co-signer. The user can also set up additional layers of security, such as spending limits and corporate treasury policies.

42397687,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDr8e,1402931325,How BitPesa Plans to Reduce Friction in the Remittances Market,"The global remittances industry is now worth over $500bn a year and, for bitcoin advocates, it represents unimpeachable proof of the need for decentralized digital currency.  With high fees on international money transfers and few players in the market, the space is, to use the cliché, ripe for disruption.  Enter BitPesa, a bitcoin remittances company that integrates with Kenya’s mobile money system M-Pesa. Its success in challenging giants like Western Union in the Kenyan market will signal whether or not bitcoin can compete in the remittances market globally.  Social business  BitPesa CEO Elizabeth Rossiello calls herself a “devotee” of micro-finance champion Muhammad Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his groundbreaking work challenging poverty with small community loans.  “[BitPesa] is a social business, certainly for profit but we're not maximising our margins,” Rossiello told CoinDesk.  A former investment banker with a long pedigree in microfinance, Rossiello was new to bitcoin when co-founder Duncan Goldie-Scot, former Director of the International Financial Cryptography Association, approached her about the idea.  Bitcoin, she recognised, could help ""cut through"" the inefficiencies in international remittances and the underdeveloped banking system in East Africa:  “[When you’re] trying to butt your head against a system that doesn't work, especially in these markets when there's other things going on, anything that can cut through that just let's the sunshine in.”  Lowering costs  With a 3% fee on transfers, BitPesa isn’t quite the peer-to-peer system bitcoin advocates dream of when talking up the potential for bitcoin in the remittances industry.  Indeed, when you add in the separate cost of buying bitcoin in order to transfer it, the effective cost to the user is likely to be 3–4% or higher depending on the exchange. Compared with Western Union, which has a 7% fee for sending $100, for example, to a mobile wallet in Kenya, it’s only possibly a little cheaper.  Rossiello argued that BitPesa’s low fees are unmatched for the service they provide and that as the business develops and increases in size, “our ability to offer cheaper margins will go up.”  Peer-to-peer bitcoin remittance transfers are currently unfeasible for a country like Kenya, she explained. There aren’t enough places to spend bitcoin and the people receiving remittances aren’t in the position to invest their money in a speculative project like bitcoin:  ""People on Reddit go off saying this is just another middleman. People [in Kenya] are even more sensitive to income flows, how can they risk losing anything or [risk vendors] not accepting bitcoin? They can't just hold the [bitcoin], they don't have extra money to invest.""  Furthermore, there is a £400 maximum limit on each BitPesa transfer because of the service's connection to the M-Pesa mobile money system.  “There is a limit because the amount of mobile money you're allowed to get in one transaction is 70,000 [Kenyan] shillings,” said Rossiello. In future, BitPesa plans to allow transfers to bank accounts, which would effectively eliminate this restriction.  Removing friction  The five-strong BitPesa team, which includes staff across several continents, as well as in Kenya, is paid in bitcoin and is going up against an antiquated and slow-to-adapt international financial system.  “International transfers are far more manual than anyone suspects,” said Amy Ludlum, BitPesa’s Head of Trading Risk Management. “There is somebody actually reading these comments on wires and, if they see anything that they don't necessarily like, they can arbitrarily reject them.”  BitPesa itself has experienced first hand the friction in the current system, recently having an international wire transfer rejected repeatedly by an intermediary before transferring the funds via bitcoin instead.  Ludlum declined to name the bank and says the transfer may have been rejected because of its connection to bitcoin:  “We can't know anything for sure because we don't receive any comments from these intermediaries, but the fact that it said bitcoin on this wire makes us think that may be the reason our funds were held hostage.”  The incident hasn’t held BitPesa back. The business is currently open to all customers, unless you’re in the United States.  “We're compliant, we just don't want to pay the [US] licensing fees,” explained Rossielo. “It's super expensive for a lean startup. $50,000 per state, that's crazy.”  BitPesa officially launched in May. Only time will tell if it can overcome the challenges other bitcoin remittances companies have faced.

42397697,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrIU,1402922432,Delta Financial Offers Interest-Bearing Bitcoin Accounts,"You can trade bitcoin to make money, but earning income by simply saving the digital currency in a risk-free account hasn’t been an option so far, since interest-bearing cryptocurrency savings accounts are rarer than hens’ teeth.  Now, though, Delta – a new web service from Hong Kong- and Vancouver-based firm Delta Financial – looks set to change that.  There have been some attempts at providing no-risk growth for cryptocurrencies in the past. Some cryptocurrencies are based on 'proof of stake’, for example, which causes coins to produce more coins, and therefore reward users for holding the digital currency, by generating more for them.  Others sell bitcoin mining power as a kind of derivative, enabling people to earn more bitcoins based on the quantity of gigahashes that they buy.  Delta Financial is the first organisation we’ve seen that offers traditional interest-bearing accounts for people simply depositing bitcoins, though.  How it works  Customers can store bitcoins and US dollars in separate accounts, each of which can earn interest, says Delta Financial’s co-founder, Euwyn Poon. There are separate interest rates for each currency, he explained, adding:  “Interest rates are dynamically adjusted based on supply and demand. They’re adjusted nightly to account for the amount of bitcoins and US dollars in the account.”  In addition, the firm guarantees a 5% minimum effective interest rate.  How can it do that? Without proof of stake, the bitcoin protocol can’t inherently generate interest on its own.  In traditional banking, accounts generate interest because banks loan your money to other people at a slightly higher interest rate than they pay you, enabling them to profit from your deposit while guaranteeing you a safe return.  Delta Financial does something similar, lending money from interest-bearing accounts to other customers. Those other customers use the loan for trading bitcoins against US dollars on the company's own margin trading platform.  “So deposit accounts reward savers, and on the flip side, active margin traders can take out loans with up to five times leverage,” explained Poon.  Leveraging and its risks  Leverage is a common concept in foreign currency trading. Currency traders deposit a certain amount (a 'margin deposit') in an account that they’ll use for trading currencies. The currency trading platform then lends them multiple times that amount, so that they can make more money by trading.  That loan is called ‘leverage’, and it is necessary for currency trading, because currency movements generally aren’t that volatile. That means people need to make bigger bets on currency movements to earn significant amounts.  Bitcoin is a more volatile asset than most currencies, although the exchange rate for the cryptocurrency has settled down in recent months.  In margin trading, the currency trading platform watches closely to ensure that the trader isn’t losing too much money, which would endanger the loan.  If the market moves against them too much and they lose too much of the leverage, the platform will execute a ‘margin call’, taking the trader’s margin deposit. In Delta Financial's case, that happens automatically.  Poon stressed:  “We do try to build in safety buffers into our margin trading platforms to ensure that risk is minimised as much as possible.""  There are a few dangers here. The most common one is that the market moves quickly against a trader, and that the trading platform isn’t able to close out its position automatically by selling the coins or dollars it needs to recover its funds. After all, bitcoin is becoming a more liquid market, but it isn’t as liquid as many more established markets.  To cover this eventuality, the firm will cover deposited funds with its own reserves in the event that the market moves so quickly that a margin deposit is lost.  Guaranteeing deposits  This raises another question: how can the company be sure that it has enough reserves to cover all of its margin deposits and bitcoin savings accounts?  “During our introductory release, we are only accepting deposits to the extent that we have the USD and BTC funds to match our reserves,” says the company. That’s one reason the company is restricting its service to start with, by running an invitation-only offering.  “We are working on other ways to insure funds in our interest accounts, which we'll announce prior to opening our platform more.”  Company history  Delta Financial, which is incorporated in Hong Kong with a software development office in Vancouver Canada, isn’t the founding team’s first rodeo.  Poon founded Opzi, a developer of social games for Android and iOS platforms funded by San Francisco-based startup incubator Y Combinator. He was also a corporate attorney in New York, specialising in mergers and acquisitions, and securities groups. He’s a clear high achiever, with degrees in both computer science and law from Cornell.  His co-founder, Wilkins Chung, also founded a Vancouver-based games startup, A Thinking Ape – another Y Combinator-funded mobile games startup. Furthermore, A Thinking Ape software engineer Mike Douglas is also on board.  Regulatory issues  One obvious danger is that interest-bearing accounts may bring the firm under regulatory scrutiny. For the time being it is only taking deposits in bitcoins rather than fiat currency (customers would have to move their bitcoins back out of USD accounts to withdraw them).  Hong Kong regulators currently don’t have a rule on the use of bitcoin as money, meaning that for now, the organization would appear relatively safe. However, it also means that the interest-bearing deposits made by its customers will not be insured by a third-party organisation.  “We are currently not insured by any governmental organization,” admitted Poon, explaining:  “We are working with legal counsel to determine the proper regulations that may apply to our product, and are committed to ensuring that our products are compliant with all applicable regulations as we move beyond our introductory period.”  Delta launches for invitation-only accounts today, Monday, 16th June.

42395330,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaLfP,1402915208,New York Holiday Inn Launches Bitcoin Payments Trial,"A Holiday Inn hotel in Brooklyn, New York, is to start accepting bitcoin payments in a pilot programme later this week.  The announcement was made by bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem at the inaugural Bitcoin Fair – a weekly digital currency-friendly pushcart market in New York City – who added that he would be in charge of the scheme.  Travellers' hotspot  In a brief chat with NewsBTC, Shrem said the Park Slope Holiday Inn Express, located on Union Street in Brooklyn, is a good choice for bitcoin, attracting as it does a large number of foreign travellers.  Bitcoin reservations will be possible either by phone, online or in person, he said.  Shrem further noted that the hotel caters to European tourists and that the company is excited about the potential fee savings and a reduction in chargeback risks offered by bitcoin.  “Accepting a European credit card comes with almost double the fees as US credit cards and much more chargeback risk,” Shrem pointed out.  More locations could follow  If all goes well, the Park Slope hotel could be just the first Holiday Inn to accept bitcoin. Shrem explained that bitcoin could be rolled out to more locations and if the trial ""goes smoothly"". It will all depend on the response the chain gets during the pilot, he said.  Shrem added that the hotel plans to keep a percentage of its bitcoin income and convert the rest to dollars in order to cover its expenses. However, he did not say what this percentage would be.  Expedia too  Last week, travel bookings giant Expedia announced that it too will start accepting bitcoin for hotel reservations and will integrate bitcoin as a payment option for all customers at check-out, alongside more traditional payment options, such as PayPal.  Expedia has a market cap of $9.75bn, making it one of the biggest companies to accept bitcoin to date. The company covers a wide range of travel services, offering bookings for airline tickets, cruise tickets, rental cars and various related activities.  Brooklyn Bridge image via Shutterstock.
