42404398,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi1eR,1586205004,Coinhouse Wins First Crypto License From French Regulator,"Crypto trading company Coinhouse has become the first crypto company to be registered with France’s top financial regulator, the Financial Markets Authority (AMF).      The registration means Coinhouse now has a shot at getting banking services in France, which could give the firm cheaper services than the German bank it currently works with.      “It’s a recognition from the AMF that you’re a serious actor and do some strict [know-your-customer] policy,” Coinhouse spokesman Julien Moretto told CoinDesk.      To receive a registration, Coinhouse had to prove it was capable of freezing assets and making funds available in the case of proven fraud. It also had to hire a compliance controller to detect suspicious financial activity and prove it could use blockchain analysis tools like Scorechain.      The firm is now raising equity and integrating risk warnings, investment disclaimers and other legal documents to make a bid for the French crypto license. Based on its discussions with the AMF, it expects the regulator to begin issuing licenses by September 2020, Moretto added.      “The registration will soon be mandatory to do buy/sell and custody activities on cryptocurrency in France, but the license will be important for the brand image,” said Sandrine Lebeau, director of compliance and risk at Coinhouse. “The license will give us the right to do commercials and ads about our services.”    Pas de bébé    In France, the only firms that are required to register with the AMF for anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing reasons are those firms dealing with fiat-to-crypto or crypto-to-fiat services. The requirements come out of guidelines based on France’s PACTE law, one of the first crypto legislative packages passed in Europe in May 2019.      “I think we improved on security and trust working with the regulator,” Lebeau said. “I don't know if the compliance is really consumer friendly, but it improves funds security for sure, which is one of our top priorities.”      Securing banking services has been the “main obstacle” to the fast expansion of France’s crypto sector, said Emilien Bernard-Alzias, a Paris-based partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons.      “PACTE law was supposed to fix this by forcing French banks to provide basic banking services to crypto firms,” he said.    A first    While the law has been in place since November 2019, only one ICO and one crypto firm – Coinhouse – have achieved this status with the AMF, Bernard-Alzias said. Moreover, the law only covers basic deposit or payment account services, which means French banks can still deny a full range of services to crypto firms.      “To the best of my knowledge, at least five others crypto players, including non-French, are in discussion with AMF to get the registration statutes,” said Hubert de Vauplane, a partner at law firm Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel.      In addition to cheaper banking, Coinhouse also expects to be able to attract larger hedge funds and family offices as clients, Moretto said. The trading firm wants to encourage those clients to “put a little crypto in [their] portfolio management,” he said.      If banks begin to show interest in crypto custody, Coinhouse could also offer those banks crypto-custody technology.      Coinhouse has also developed some DeFi services, like staking, that require crypto custody. With the registration, it will now offer custody services for customers instead of having customers carry staked crypto in their personal wallets.      Coinhouse also plans to develop a euro-pegged stablecoin that will allow customers to pre-fund their accounts to buy crypto more quickly, Moretto said.      In addition to these new products, Moretto expects to see client demand increase across the entire business as a result of the registration and subsequent license.      “Now we can say we are registered and recognized by financial authorities,” Moretto said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/06/coinhouse-wins-first-crypto-license-from-french-regulator,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87d52c6365b79bd70045bc6673bafb70b211c558-2560x1709.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404417,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi1gP,1586203502,Nestlé Partners With Rainforest Alliance to Trace Coffee Beans,"Nestlé has added its Zoégas coffee brand to the IBM Food Trust blockchain and partnered with the Rainforest Alliance to bolster the coffee’s data traceability.      The food giant first announced the news in a blog post Monday. It will add QR codes to Zoégas’ “Summer 2020” coffee product packaging, sold in Sweden. When scanned, these codes will show consumers their beans’ journey from harvest to shelf, with documentation stored on IBM’s food tracing blockchain.      IBM Food Trust will get part of that data from the sustainable product certification nonprofit the Rainforest Alliance and the rest from Nestlé. That marks a change of stance for the multinational food conglomerate, which had “limited” third party supply chain data in previous QR code traceable product campaigns.      “Up until now we had been testing the best way to deploy IBM Food Trust internally alongside current systems,” a Nestlé spokesperson told CoinDesk. “We had to first build a robust knowledge and knowhow base on our deployment before linking our data to other organizations for an end to end view.”      After three years of IBM Food Trust trials and with two open-data product launches on the books, Nestlé felt that Food Trust was ready for more data sources, a sentiment the Nestlé spokesperson said Rainforest Alliance shared.      “They certify many of our coffees, but they were also very open to innovation to bring this information to consumers in a different way,” the spokesperson said.      Nestlé said the collaboration did not pose much of a technical challenge as IBM Food Trust has become “fairly mature” and Rainforest Alliance was willing to invest time and effort to make it work.      Rainforest Alliance has experience tracing coffee products with blockchain systems as a client of the supply chain software firm ChainPoint. (ChainPoint is separate from the open source Chainpoint protocol). A spokesperson for the Alliance did not immediately respond to questions about whether ChainPoint was being used in the Nestlé collaboration.      Nestlé’s previous Northern European blockchain product pilots make it confident that Zoégas will “resonate” with the Swedes, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson declined to state how many consumers have scanned previous QR code campaigns, “but we have seen a great level of engagement so far.”      Blockchain traceable coffee is a marketing trend being seen across the coffee industry, and the world. Starbucks is working with Microsoft’s Azure blockchain to bring its consumers “farm to cup” information, as is Medici ventures-backed GrainChain, and IBM, which in January debuted a coffee tracing app.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/06/nestle-partners-with-rainforest-alliance-to-trace-coffee-beans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84843476aa1fc49ddec44b5b867abce3489c8faf-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404390,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi1WZ,1586199600,China Is Winning the Coronavirus Information War,"Teddy Fusaro is the chief operating officer at Bitwise Asset Management, a cryptocurrency asset management firm in San Francisco. He has held management and leadership positions at alternative asset management companies for the past decade, and began his career at Goldman Sachs.      Westerners often say the Chinese word for crisis has two meanings: “danger” and “opportunity.” Without passing judgment on the character of the word (wēijī, 危机), my assessment is that this is a time of great opportunity for the People’s Republic of China, the Communist Party of China (CCP) and its General Secretary, the President of China, Xi Jinping. And it is a time of great danger for the existing world order and the United States’ role within it.      The existing world order was formed in the era of American empire and hegemony, a world defined by the growth of capitalism and spread of democracy; a system that has existed since the middle of the twentieth century, where the United States controls trade routes, extends military power and possesses the most powerful object in the world: the global reserve currency, the United States dollar.      See also: Michael Casey - China Seizes the Blockchain Opportunity. How Should the US Respond?      In a post-coronavirus world, the U.S. risks losing its status as leader of the free world and, with it, the claim to a set of ideals framed in our Constitution. The power on the other side of that dichotomy is the world’s great emerging power, the People’s Republic of China, and its authoritarian system of state capitalism.    Xi’s War on 'COVID-19'    At first, the Chinese Communist Party, by all accounts, reeled from the disaster, too. The government silenced those who spoke out about it, obviously obscured the data related to those who were sick and have died (this they continue to do), and refused entry of international health officials.      As the virus spread, Communist Party of China Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijan began promoting a theory that members of the U.S. Army who visited Wuhan in October 2019 brought the virus to China. CCP state media organs repeated the story, and the U.S. State Department summoned the ambassador to the U.S. and used strong language to denounce the accusation.      The State Department release says that “Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo spoke by phone on March 16 with Yang Jiechi, Director of the Office of Foreign Affairs of the Communist Party of China. Secretary Pompeo conveyed strong U.S. objections to PRC efforts to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States.”      See also: Teddy Fusaro - The US Needs a Wartime Effort to Win the Coronavirus Battle      Furthermore, the CCP propaganda machine has taken great lengths to establish and brand the global pandemic as “COVID-19,” instead of allowing any geographically descriptive naming convention to take root. The CCP has found a willing dance partner in the Western political left and associated media, both constituencies always eager to promote cultural togetherness (a noble cause, no doubt).      Political divisions within the United States have aided in turning this into a left/right issue, with the President referring antagonistically to COVID-19 as “ChinaVirus” and being pilloried in response by the left-leaning political commentariat, already inflamed by the early failures of the U.S. response, and reeling itself from its lack of teeth in waiting so long to cover the crisis in broad publications. Meanwhile, whitewashing the Chinese association from the pandemic’s global nomenclature (many prior pandemics are descriptively termed based on their regional origin, such as Zika, West Nile virus, the Spanish flu, Ebola, etc.) is a key part of the strategy to separate China from its role as initial source of the of the outbreak and smoothes the transition into its preferred and powerful narrative as defender of the globe and supplier of medical equipment to stricken nations.      The CCP did, however, buy the entire world critical time – a month or more – to prepare for what was coming by implementing draconian measures to close entire cities and economies and implementing social distancing by force and mandate. Reports indicate that, once taken seriously, the CCP and President Xi executed and implemented the pandemic playbook with precision and authority (keeping people inside and separate, cancelling public events, requiring the wearing of masks in public in affected areas, etc.).    The CCP’s ability to control, decide, and enact appears at this moment in stark contrast to the American model.    By that time, any reasonable person with a spreadsheet and a basic understanding of exponential math knew the risk of COVID-19 spreading across the globe was high. But Western governments, including the one that leads the world, our government in Washington DC, failed to respond to take advantage of that window.      Instead, as the United States cannot even internally allocate resources to deal with our sick and dying, China is manufacturing medical equipment and supplies, and shipping it to the rest of the world. And the all-important publicity campaign – coordinated through diplomats, official and unofficial CCP spokespeople, global media, state media, and non-governmental organizations – of announcing these provisions of aid to virus stricken countries has been equally strong.      The CCP media strategy is to ensure the announcement of this aid (which, it should be accurately noted, is gracious, life-saving, and a blessing for many in need) is widely publicized, so that credit is given where credit is due. A very specific image is being curated.      The picture being drawn across the internet, if you zoom out enough, is of one a world power in decline – hardly able to fight the virus on its own home turf – while another one rises to the occasion, and not only stops the virus at home, but extends that leadership abroad, saving lives in countries around the planet.    The dream of revival    In “Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China” Evan Osnos describes one of the most startling things he observed upon returning to China after a near-decade hiatus in 2012.      It was the striking change in Chinese culture’s interpretation of the word “ye xin” – the Chinese word for “ambition.” The literal interpretation of the word is “wild heart” and had previously “carried the suggestion of savage abandon and absurd expectations – a toad who dreams of devouring a swan, as an old saying had it.” But in the near decade that had passed before he returned to China in 2012 – just in that small amount of time – the word’s meaning and power had changed dramatically.      Children’s books, self-help books for adults, television programs, talk shows, and the news, all spoke of the pioneering spirit of the “wild heart” of ambition.      China has been one of the world’s great powers – or its greatest power – for most of human history. And the last 30 years of growth in China have been nothing short of shocking when viewed on historical scale. It is beyond the scope of this piece to put that growth into context, but I will point out that in 1872, the United States had ""per capita income"" of three thousand dollars per year, and it took nearly 60 years for the U.S. to go from there to seven thousand. China did it in seven years between 2000 and 2007.      See also: China Has Many Strategic Reasons to Invest in Blockchain      The growth of China into the second most powerful country in the world is so shockingly abrupt that it doesn’t actually look real on a long-term chart. In 1978 U.S. President Jimmy Carter officially announced the recognition of the Communist government in Beijing. In just 40 years, it has become the second largest economy in the world, and the engine of the world’s growth.      In recent years, China has also begun to flex its military muscle in the region, antagonizing the Philippines, Vietnam and others, while strengthening its military power in the South China Sea. It has increased its military activity generally, begun conducting naval maneuvers and exercises, and has constructed military and industrial outposts on artificial islands in disputed waters. World powers historically extend military strength first across their networks of important trade routes, and this pattern looks no different. The CCP understands more well than anyone else it’s growing power on the world stage. Lux Xun, China’s greatest modern writer, wrote that “hope is like a path in the countryside. Originally, there was no path, but once people begin to pass, a way appears.”      It is broadly accepted by historians that major shifts in geopolitical relationships — wars, phase transitions, shifts in balances of power – often coincide with massive disruptions to economies – debt crises. History shows that politics, power, and economics are always tightly intertwined. COVID-19 is an opportunity for the CCP.    A system worth defending    Capitalism, and systems of government that work functionally alongside and through it, has proven to be the greatest system in the history of the world for raising humans out of poverty, increasing total wealth levels and distributing opportunity across populations. Humans are now happier, healthier, less violent, more rich, and live a better lifestyle than at any time in human history. And that success is now more widely distributed from top to bottom than at any time since humans walked the earth (and this despite the very real growing wealth gaps and common misunderstanding of just how good things have gotten). Freedom, liberty, capitalism, the free press and the free market – western liberalism – have given humans the ability to express themselves and behave as they see fit like never before, and has given us the greatest improvement in living standards in the history of the earth. But a new model has arisen in the East – Chinese State Capitalism – and its time may have arrived.      The United States World Order, with the U.S. as the pre-eminent world power, has allowed Americans in particular to enjoy many advantages. Status as the issuer of the world’s reserve currency brings an economically advantageous, cyclically reinforcing wealth creation mechanism and a durable advantage over all other nations in the world. In addition to its military might, the U.S. dollar’s reserve status is the most powerful tool in the American arsenal. That status is at risk in initiatives like China's digital currency.      The CCP’s ability to control, decide, and enact appears at this moment in stark contrast to the American model of disagreement, disorganization and delay.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Teddy Fusaro,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/06/china-is-winning-the-coronavirus-information-war,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/81a91bac5b1e02ed74cce1bf3b663c7306e66a8d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The notice is a summary of the 2020 National Currency Gold Silver and Security Work Video and Telephone Conference, convened on Friday by Yifei Fan, the central bank’s vice governor. One of the annual meeting’s goals was to lay out top priorities for the bank in this coming year.       While this was at least the third time a digitized yuan, or Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP), was mentioned in the annual meeting, the unequivocal language used indicates a firmer stance on the project than before.       At the 2018 meeting, the bank said it would pursue the project “at a steady pace.” Last year, it said it would “accelerate” the process with a closer look at trends in cryptocurrency space at home and abroad and more strict supervision over online financing in 2019.       While the initiative is a few years old, it may have added impetus from coronavirus-related concerns about physical banknotes. At a Feb. 15 press conference, the central bank said it would disinfect and store cash for seven to 14 days before it takes it in, and put 600 billion yuan of new cash in circulation.

42404402,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdi1hO,1586196000,"Zoom Has Privacy Issues, Here Are Some Alternatives","Zoom, the popular-by-necessity video conferencing platform, has seen an explosion in users as the coronavirus pandemic forces people to work from home. In a recent blog post, CEO Eric S. Yuan said Zoom now has 200 million users, up from just 10 million last December.      But, with that increase in users has come greater scrutiny of Zoom’s privacy and security. With widespread reports of Zoombombing (where strangers dial in your channel with something rude and disruptive), the company’s procedures have been called into question by the New York Attorney General, and prompted a class-action lawsuit.      The New York’s Attorney General said he is “concerned that Zoom’s existing security practices might not be sufficient to adapt to the recent and sudden surge in both the volume and sensitivity of data being passed through its network.”      Until recently, Zoom’s iPhone app included software that surreptitiously funneled user data to Facebook. The lawsuit says the code allowed Facebook to target users with ads.      Zoom has been criticized for ignoring privacy before. A year ago, a researcher found four million Zoom user cameras were potentially vulnerable to remote takeover without you knowing.      The company is currently pausing all feature development and “shifting all our engineering resources to focus on our biggest trust, safety and privacy issues,” Yuan said. But for many users, this isn’t good enough. They’ve already lost trust in Zoom and are searching for alternatives (which we identify below).      “Despite its ease of use, Zoom does not seem to take privacy seriously,” said Reuben Yap, Zcoin Project Steward. “Despite claims that Zoom’s video calls are [end-to-end] encrypted, this isn’t actually the case. E2E encryption means that even Zoom should not be able to view the contents of the videos or calls.”      “Instead, all Zoom provides is transport encryption, meaning that it is secured to the extent that outsiders cannot intercept the call and view it. This still means that we have to trust Zoom to not read or leak this info. Given its track record, I don’t have high hopes,” Yap said.      Yoav Degani, the founder of MyPrivacy, an app that bundles privacy protection tools such as a VPN and a password manager, said there are several privacy and security issues with Zoom. Because meetings can be recorded and uploaded to the cloud, which is not secured, people who are not on the meeting can get a recording (like your boss for example). Also, organizers can receive a text file with the transcript of the meeting chat.      “There's also a feature available to the meeting's host called attendee attention tracking,” said Degani. “It allows the host to monitor participants' computers and see if someone is not active in the Zoom call for more than 30 seconds.”      See also: How to Protect Your Online Privacy While Working From Home      You may not be officially active if, say, you put the Zoom window in the background and play some game or read some post on Facebook.      Degani said some bad guys are taking advantage of the situation and there are dozens of websites with the name “Zoom” that all of a sudden appear in search results and advertising and are used for phishing.    Locking down your video    Several people who build and develop privacy-oriented tools recommend Jitsi as a more secure alternative to Zoom.      Emil Ivov, one of the founders of Jitsi, said what sets it apart from other video conferencing services is its low friction. Creating a meeting is as simple as typing your name in, and it’s just one click to join. The company uses WebRTC, or Web Realtime Communications, which enables peer-to-peer video, data and audio communication between two web browsers. So on desktops there are no downloads and no accounts needed, said Ivov.      “We are really mindful about privacy and security,” said Ivov. “We require no personal data and fully support anonymous use. We are also open source. This is where we are truly unique. If you have any concerns about how we run our service, then you can just go and run your own! It only takes 15 minutes.”      Being open source also means anyone can scrutinize its software. But Jitsi does not feature end-to-end encryption.      “For now this is simply not possible with WebRTC, although the whole community is looking into the problem and we are hoping there will soon be solutions,” said Ivov. “For the time being, however, all your data is encrypted in-flight using DTLS-SRTP [a protocol which adds encryption and ensures message authentication and integrity] as per the WebRTC standard. None of your media content leaves your computer unencrypted.”      Jitsi is one more secure alternative, and another includes Whereby. One big drawback: Users are limited to four meeting participants in the free version. The Pro version of Whereby is $9.99 per month, and allows up to 12 participants per room in up to three meeting rooms.      Other one-to-one alternatives include Facetime, which does have end-to-end encryption, as does Signal, the privacy-focused messaging and call app.      “Products and services can be built to be both convenient and to protect privacy by design at the back-end,” says Raullen Chai, CEO of IoTeX, a Silicon Valley company that develops privacy-protecting smart devices. “Then you don’t have to worry about whether or not you trust a centralized party because it is built in what can and can’t happen with your data, returning control to the consumer. Blockchain-based key issuance allows for true end-to-end encryption without having to trust a central provider to not keep a key for themselves.”      Take all this into account, and it’s just one more indicator that yes, that meeting could probably be an email. As long as it’s one sent securely, that is.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/06/zoom-has-privacy-issues-here-are-some-alternatives,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/82e1ea748e3ebdb9abd7a1cc0dafa4aef929b1b1-1292x838.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But it gets even more subjective when investors begin to think about “return of capital” more than “return on capital.”      Many investors stay invested in stocks throughout drawdowns, believing equity investing is about long-term historical average returns and not day-to-day or year-to-year fluctuations. Plenty of other investors prefer the safety of government or corporate bonds due to their seniority and stable cash flows. Some become concerned about counterparty risk and move money out of banks and brokerages and into cash, while others fear cash and move to gold to protect against inflation or lack of trust in local government. And, of course, a small but rising group of people want to rid themselves of as many systemic risks as possible and move into bitcoin (BTC) or other digital assets.      See also: Byrne Hobart - Bitcoin Is a Safe Haven for a Worse Storm Than This      None of these opinions are wrong. All have some merit.      But the different value drivers of equity, debt and digital assets may begin to manifest from the seemingly inevitable recession that will result from the current COVID-19 pandemic. All three are arguably part of the new ""capital structure"" now, but each creates value in entirely different ways.    Debt = Claim on assets  Equity = Assets minus liabilities or a claim on excess profits/cash flows  Digital Assets = Claim on future services and customer growth    Given this backdrop, it’s possible digital assets are the only asset class not actually affected by a recession.      Companies and projects in the digital asset world pre-fund themselves via the sale of tokens, thereby creating a service liability in how the token is ultimately redeemed in the future. The token can unlock usage of the product, can be used for discounts on services rendered, or in some cases can even gain economically via direct claims on future revenue.      This process is similar to companies that sell gift cards, which tend to speed up revenue recognition (booked upfront), but create a liability for the company in terms of future services/products delivered. Airline miles behave similarly as customers can earn them (or buy them), but it creates a future service liability for the airline. Notably, these future services don’t disappear during a recession and, as such, technically do not lose value.    In a fundamental way, digital assets are not actually losing value whereas the value of stocks and bonds is most definitely lower today.    The difficult conditions caused by global quarantine are simultaneously creating both demand shocks (lack of customers, job losses) and supply shocks (lack of production). This is having disastrous effects on revenue and profits (destroying equity value), and asset coverage (destroying debt recovery), but to date has had little to no effect on customer loyalty (gift cards/airline miles) or future service claims (tokens).      While fundamentals may not have mattered in the past 10 years as the “everything bubble” inflated all assets, we believe they will matter in the years ahead as revenue stagnate and debt begins to impair cash flows. At times like these, we are reminded equity and debt valuations rely on actual cash flows and hard assets, not just agreed-upon expansion multiples. Historically, the best combination for multiples has been strong growth and low inflation, but we are now entering a world of below-average growth and above-average inflation.      Further, most companies with debt and equity rely on physical customers and physical locations, and almost always rely on supply chains (with the exception of certain e-commerce companies). Conversely, most crypto companies and projects don’t have physical stores, customers or supply chains. They are the epitome of a “truly digital world.""      See also: Osho Jha - As This Crisis Worsens, Bitcoin Will Become a Safe Haven Again      From crypto trading exchanges, to video games and virtual worlds, to decentralized finance and web 3.0, the shift from physical to digital is happening, and we believe COVID-19 is further accelerating this evolution. Just as your Delta SkyMiles and Target gift cards don’t go away or lose value during an economic crisis, neither do the intrinsic value of digital assets. These tokens are claims on future services, not claims on revenue, profit or assets. As a result, most of these digital projects and companies appear to be immune to demand shocks and supply shocks. One day we may even say “digital assets are recession-proof.”      Crypto prices may, of course, still go lower. After all, risk is risk. But, in a fundamental way, digital assets are not actually losing value whereas the value of stocks and bonds is most definitely lower today than it was earlier this year. You could certainly argue digital assets are overvalued, but not because of what has transpired over the past six weeks.      Equity value is declining as profits decline. Debt value is declining as asset value declines. Fiat currency value is being devalued by money printing. Commodity value is being harmed by a reduction in economic activity.      You can argue digital assets never had value to begin with, but it is hard to argue their value is going down right now. In fact, it may be the only asset whose true value is unchanged.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | TRADING,Jeff Dorman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/06/digital-assets-are-more-recession-proof-than-you-might-think,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45abc2789e2341dfe072efd3ea11b805a3a2dc99-1500x976.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The South Korean central bank said Monday it had reevaluated the CBDC proposal after observing that other developed nations, including neighboring Japan and its close ally the U.S., were moving forward with their own digital currency plans faster than anticipated.      Abandoning their wait-and-see approach, BOK officials have now pushed the central bank into a 22-month pilot program – which started this month – to assess the technical and legal ramifications of replacing physical cash with a digital equivalent.      ""The U.S. and Japan had had no plans to issue a CBDC in the near future, but they changed their stance recently to enhance research in the emerging area,"" said an official, speaking to The Korea Times. ""The BOK also decided to remain proactive in the rapid shift in payment environments here and abroad, so we are going to set up the CBDC pilot system and check technical and legal issues surrounding its introduction here.""      See also: South Korean Central Bank to Organize a CBDC Task Force      CBDCs have become an extension of existing international rivalries, with some seeing digital currencies at the center of currency struggle to replace the dollar-denominated global economy. That China, the emerging global powerhouse, has made its digital yuan a top priority has forced lawmakers in other countries to press their own governments to begin work on CBDC initiatives.      Back in February, a group of senior Japanese politicians petitioned their government – which has already joined a CBDC working group – to share and collaborate on as much digital currency research as possible with close allies, including the U.S., against China's bid for complete ""currency supremacy.""      In the U.S., a digital dollar campaign has garnered support from a group of former regulatory chiefs, a Treasury undersecretary and presidential adviser. The U.S. government itself has kept its cards closer to its chest, but Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard revealed in February research is underway into whether a digital dollar could counter private initiatives like Facebook's libra.

But one caveat buried deep within Monday's five-page press release says that position could also change should there be a substantial shift in ""domestic and external conditions.""

42404369,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhytF,1586182152,"Bitcoin, Equities Markets Rally on Signs of Hope","The new – and now often-cited – connection between bitcoin (BTC) and global equities doesn’t just mean they fall together.      Sometimes, it means they rally on potentially good news. And that seems to be the case on Monday, as positive data on the war on the coronavirus offer hope to the markets that better days may come soon.      The price of bitcoin is at $7,145 as of 13:45 UTC (8:45 a.m. Eastern time), a 5 percent gain from the previous 24 hours. The move began during Asian equity market trading hours as Japan’s Nikkei index moved up 4.2 percent. Futures contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average also had some sunshine around then, indicating a more than 700-point gain when New York traders heard their opening bell.      Part of that optimism in stock markets and in cryptocurrencies stems from a few glimmers of hope on the coronavirus front.      “Looks like we're piggybacking on equities with some data possibly indicating virus peaking coming out of a few of the European countries,” said Dave Vizsolyi, head of trading at Chicago-based proprietary crypto trading firm DV Chain.      To be sure, cryptocurrency markets often gyrate with little rhyme or reason, and an original selling point of bitcoin was as a non-correlated asset, indifferent to movements in traditional markets. However, during the recent crisis, the bellwether digital asset has tended to track the incumbents.    Signs of progress    Daily new cases are slowing in places like Italy, where they have stayed in the 4,000 range since March 30; at its peak on March 21, over 6,500 new cases were reported. New York, the hardest-hit state in the U.S., saw a slight drop in coronavirus-related deaths; 4,159 lives were lost in the Empire State so far, but Sunday saw the first daily drop in fatalities since the crisis began.      That’s not to say the week promises to be easy on the United States, where there are more than 300,000 cases, a quarter of the world’s total.      “This is going to be the hardest and saddest week of most Americans’ lives,” U.S. Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams said on Fox News over the weekend. “This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment, only it’s not going to be localized. It’s going to be happening all over the country.”      However, his commander-in-chief, President Donald Trump, took a more glass-half-full approach, proclaiming in all-caps “LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL” on his preferred method of communication, Twitter.    Grim picture      Nonetheless, some in the crypto markets aren’t sold on the idea that the worst is behind us.      Paxos exchange CEO Chad Cascarilla warned of a grim picture on Patrick O’Shaughnessy’s podcast, “Invest Like the Best,” if fiscal and monetary stimulus prove too little, too late.      Cascarilla sees about a 25 percent chance the U.S. would need a bank holiday similar to what happened in the Great Depression and even some nationalization in its financial sector.      “It looks likely that we’re in a depression for at least a quarter or two,” Cascarilla said. “If you’re in that for more than two quarters, I think you need to have bank failures. The market would have a really hard time digesting that. If we need to fill a $6 trillion hole, I’m not sure we can do that in time before the feedback loops kick in. And then you can end up with a bank holiday and nationalization.”",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/06/bitcoin-equities-markets-rally-on-signs-of-hope,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8bd5d2794ac8a8bc0d8af9fae033793adeba740c-1482x836.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404365,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhysG,1586180445,Poloniex's New Tron-Powered IEO Platform Moves Exchange Closer to Justin Sun's Orbit,"Poloniex has launched an initial exchange offering (IEO) platform that aligns the exchange more closely with the interests of Tron founder Justin Sun.      Seychelles-based Poloniex – acquired by a group of investors including Sun in 2019 – said Sunday the new IEO platform, dubbed LaunchBase, would serve as a springboard to ""help quality blockchain projects grow and further develop their ecosystem."" The IEO platform, together with ""launch partner"" Tron, will promote user adoption through distributing tokens and professional consultation, Poloniex said in a blog post.      Notably, the exchange said Tron's TRX cryptocurrency would be the only eligible cryptocurrency for purchasing new tokens on LaunchBase. Further, the first company scheduled for a sale will be the Tron-based stablecoin lending platform JUST.      The blog announcement is unclear whether LaunchBase is exclusively for Tron startups, or whether projects based on alternative protocols are also welcome.      ""Huge congrats on launching Poloniex LaunchBase, a world-leading token sale platform! As Poloniex’s strategic partner, Tron Foundation and I will fully support the LaunchBase platform and its future development,"" Sun said on Twitter, Sunday.      Similar to an initial coin offering, an IEO is a crowdfunding tool for cryptocurrency startups, with an exchange acting as a trusted broker offering the token sale. The exchange also provides a proprietary token to execute the sale, in this case TRX.      For more on IEOs, check our video explainer.      Poloniex used to be one of the largest exchanges on the block. At one point, 50 percent of all crypto payments went through Poloniex servers. This continued even after payments app Circle bought the exchange for a reported $400 million. By the time the exchange spun out again, it only made up one percent of the total market volume.      Although Sun first denied reports he was involved in the investment group that purchased Poloniex last year, he confirmed it later at an event live streamed on Twitter. It's unclear who else was in the investment group, or how much sway the 29-year-old Sun has within it.      Sun has a history of taking over distressed companies. In 2018 he purchased the internet file-sharing platform BitTorrent, which, according to sources speaking to TechCrunch, had long been looking for a buyer.      Initial uneasiness about the acquisition appeared to materialize this January when some former BitTorrent employees sued Sun and the new management team for allegedly subjecting them to harassment and bullying for not releasing software updates fast enough.      See also: Poloniex Drops KYC for Withdrawals Below $10,000 Following US Exit      Earlier this year, Sun also bought Steemit, the most popular app on the struggling blockchain-based blogging network Steem. A power struggle between Sun and the Steem community quickly ensued, which eventually led to a community hard fork in attempt to move away from Sun. Both Poloniex and Binance staked tokens in support of Sun, but Binance founder Changpeng Zhao later apologized to the Steemit community for aiding and abetting a ""hostile takeover.""      Despite Sun's claims that Poloniex operates independently to the Tron Foundation, the relationship between the two remains hazy. Sun appears to have active influence over Poloniex, having announced a TRX20 airdrop campaign for Poloniex users during the same speech in which he said he'd bought the exchange.      See also: Fired Employees’ Harassment Suit Against Tron Will Move to Private Arbitration      CoinDesk approached Tron and Poloniex seeking to find out more on the relationship between the two entities, including information on the share of the exchange Sun actually owns.

The Barbados-based firm announced its intentions to build out a Polkadot parachain based on Parity Technologies’ Substrate network. The move is part of Shyft’s larger effort to create a universal standard for cryptocurrency regulatory compliance. It also complements Polkadot’s primary focus on interoperability.      “Once fully deployed, the Shyft chain will enable Polkadot users to bridge identities from other networks, and from DApps built on other networks, to all Polkadot parachains,” Shyft wrote in a statement. “In other words, Polkadot users will have access to their interactions on DApps built in other ecosystems.”      Shyft is looking to become an “identity layer” for Parity’s permissionless blockchain network, the firm said in a statement. Polkadot is set up so that anyone can build their own parachain.      Read more: Inside the Standards Race for Implementing FATF’s Travel Rule      In an interview, Shyft co-founder Joseph Weinberg described the firm in two parts: a digital ID application tool – such as one created for the island nation of Bermuda – and architecture for compliance between governments, blockchain firms and users.      “To the best of our ability, we want to be able to provide open tools and infrastructure so that companies or smart contracts or non-custodial wallets … are able to at least partially solve the problem,” Weinberg said, describing the recent global regulation from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) known as the “Travel Rule.”      Weinberg said he helped write regulations for crypto governance in multiple countries, including Bermuda and Mauritius. Shyft is adding those standards to every blockchain for ease of use, he said.      Read more: Web3’s Gavin Wood Launches Kusama Network to Test Polkadot Protocol      The dedication to interoperability means Shyft is code-heavy compared to other blockchains, having “one of the largest, if not the largest, contract codebases” in the industry, Weinberg said. The firm’s blockchain itself is a version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means that every public blockchain Shyft wants to provide tools for has to be built manually, sometimes from the ground up.      Minus its experimental canary network, Kusama, Polkadot has yet to launch. Once it does, Shyft intends to be ready.      “Excited to see more projects integrating with Polkadot,” Parity Technologies spokesman Peter Mauric told CoinDesk in a DM. “The goal is to provide Web3 project devs with all the options they may want to have at their disposal to build the next generation of decentralized applications.”      Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, recently signed Shyft to build solutions for the Travel Rule.      FATF created the guidance in 2019 concerning the movements of cryptocurrency across national borders.

42404385,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhz9y,1586177272,First Mover: Trillions in Coronavirus Stimulus Bring Out the Bitcoin Bulls,"""It's exactly why bitcoin (BTC) was created,"" Michael Novogratz, CEO of the cryptocurrency-focused investment firm Galaxy Digital, told CNBC last week.      It's a common refrain heard these days from bitcoin bulls: The U.S. dollar and other currencies will eventually be debased by the injections of trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related aid and monetary stimulus by governments and central banks. That should, theoretically, strengthen the case for bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, as a hedge against inflation.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Such predictions might eventually come true, but for now bitcoin investors are stuck in a holding pattern: The cryptocurrency pushed above $7,000 on Monday, but for the past couple weeks it has struggled to hold that level, which it hasn't reliably traded above since early March.      ""A nice recovery from the lows leaves investors hopeful,"" cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research wrote Friday in a report. ""However, this is not yet reflected in the market sentiment.""      Any inflation stemming from fiscal and monetary stimulus could take a while to appear – partly because of higher unemployment and a drop-off in economic demand could relieve upward pressure on consumer prices in the near term. In the U.S. alone, roughly 10 million new unemployment claims were filed during the last two full weeks of March, and JPMorgan economists predict that a report this week will reveal another seven million claims were filed last week. Bank of America says the lack of an effective policy response to control the spread of the virus will push 2020 global growth to a contraction of 2.7 percent, instead of an expansion of 0.3 percent.      Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures and co-founder of the blockchain analytics startup CoinMetrics, wrote last week for CoinDesk that the devaluation of money ""does not happen immediately, but over time.""      The 2008 financial crisis prompted the Federal Reserve to double total assets in a matter of weeks, and then doubled the size of the balance sheet again to more than $4 trillion over the next few years. But it took the money supply, as measured by M2, more than 12 years to double, at least partly because of low demand for loans in the years after the crisis.      The bitcoin market's tepid reaction thus far to the Federal Reserve's announcement of essentially unbounded quantitative easing might disappoint some bitcoiners who are looking for a faster pump.      Sylvain Saurel, author of the blog In Bitcoin We Trust, wrote last week that a separate move by U.S. regulators to reduce bank reserve requirements could lead to new money creation ""ad infinitum.""      ""This unprecedented currency devaluation in such a short period of time has been decided by the Federal Reserve in a totally arbitrary manner,"" Saurel wrote. His conclusion, essentially, was that people should buy bitcoin.      Jay Hao, CEO of the Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, wrote last week in a blog post that ""more proactive measures"" would be needed beyond ""QE infinity."" Those could include a new ""super-sovereign currency"" to address trade and economic imbalances created by the U.S. dollar's dominant role in global finance.      ""At present, bitcoin possesses the characteristics of a super-sovereign currency,"" Hao wrote.      The investment narrative that bitcoin is a ""harder"" currency than U.S. dollars and is getting additional traction from next month's ""halving"" on the bitcoin blockchain – the once-every-four-years occurrence by which the pace of issuance of new units of the cryptocurrency gets cut in half.      Traders are expected to get a chance this week to observe how prices of two bitcoin-offshoot cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), perform as they go through their own quadrennial halvings.      Some analysts said last month that bitcoin was trading in sync with U.S. stocks. That was seen as a sign that some investors were selling the cryptocurrency as part of an indiscriminate flight to safety – into dollars.      Olga Feldmeier, CEO of the digital-asset exchange Smart Valor and a self-described ""outright bitcoin maximalist,"" says bitcoin's price plunge earlier this year undercuts hopes that the cryptocurrency would serve as a safe-haven asset in times of market turmoil. She instead recommended ""tokenized gold"" – digital tokens like the Pax Gold (PAXG) – that offer a crypto-friendly way of investing in the yellow metal, long seen as a reliable inflation hedge.      Kraken, a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange, noted in an April 4 blog post that the volume of PAXG trading on its platform surged to $13 million in March, a six-fold increase from February levels.      ""Kraken clients appear to see PAXG as a safe haven of late since it is backed by gold, which typically acts as a safe haven amidst economic uncertainty,"" according to the post.      But there are some indications that bitcoin might be trading more like gold in recent weeks. VanEck, a money-management firm that offers a bitcoin trust to qualified institutional buyers, says bitcoin's price correlation with gold jumped to 0.47 during the last couple weeks of March, from an average 0.03 over the past eight years. (A correlation of 1 implies perfect synchronicity.)      The next couple months could prove pivotal for bitcoin as the U.S. suffers the worst stretch of the pandemic's health crisis and moves into the economic-recovery phase. Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, told CNBC last week the recently passed $2 trillion aid package would not be enough. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would ask Congress for more money if a $350 billion pool for small businesses runs out.      ""More bazookas needed,"" executives for the Wall Street dealer Jefferies wrote Friday in an open letter to clients and colleagues.      Is bitcoin the real digital gold? With more financial ""bazookas"" getting hoisted into position, cryptocurrency markets will serve as the proving ground.      ""Many Bitcoin advocates think it will prove to be a better long-term store of value than gold,"" according to the Kraken blog post. ""Only time will tell.""    Tweet of the day    Editor's caveat: No idea if this $20 ""Bitcoin Logo V2 Neck Gaiter Face Mask"" is real. If so the free publicity here does NOT represent an endorsement. It seems like a high price for a mostly polyester bandana. But it certainly is a sign of the times.    BITCOIN WATCH    Bitcoin is again looking to establish a strong foothold above $7,000, having tested dip demand with a pullback to $6,600 over the weekend. The cryptocurrency printed a high above $7,100 early Monday and is currently changing hands around $7,090.      The bulls have repeatedly failed to keep gains above the $7,000 mark over the last three weeks, forcing investors to question the sustainability of recovery rally from the March 19 low of $3,867.      Even so, the bias remains bullish, as a pennant breakout confirmed April 2 is still intact. As a result, the cryptocurrency remains on the hunt for a test of the descending 50-day average, currently at $7,522.      If the upside break of $7,000 resistance again proves to be short-lived, the immediate bullish outlook would be neutralized. The bias would turn bearish if prices fall below support at the weekend low of $6,610.      That would open the doors to the higher low of $5,856 created March 30.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/06/first-mover-trillions-in-coronavirus-stimulus-bring-out-the-bitcoin-bulls,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/619d7483963b2df850d4cd577900783689e6de6f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404375,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhz17,1586170033,"Major Crypto Firms Including Binance, Civic, Tron Targeted in Flood of Lawsuits","A flood of class-action lawsuits were filed in New York Friday, taking aim at a number of major cryptocurrency projects.      First reported by Offshore Alert, at least 10 complaints were filed in the Southern District of New York on April 3, alleging the firms had sold crypto tokens to U.S. investors that were in fact unregistered securities.      Among those targeted in the suits are cryptocurrency exchanges Binance (see complaint) and BitMEX operator HDR Global Trading, as well as notable blockchain projects like Tron (see complaint), Civic, Block.One, Kyber Network and Status. Bibox, Quantstamp, Bancor and Kucoin are also named in individual complaints.      The actions, which also name executives from the firms including Binance's CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao and Civic's Vinny Lingham, were brought by ""litigation boutique"" Roche Cyrulnik Freedman on behalf of the plaintiffs. The law firm is also currently representing the Kleiman estate in a lawsuit against Craig Wright over a trove of bitcoin worth billions.      The complaint against Binance states:    ""Binance and the Issuers wrongfully engaged in millions of transactions—including the solicitation, offer, and sale of securities—without registering the Tokens as securities, and without Binance registering with the SEC as an exchange or broker-dealer. As a result, investors were not informed of the significant risks inherent in these investments, as federal and state securities laws require.""    The suits have been brought on behalf of several individuals, including Chase Williams, Alexander Clifford and Eric Lee, as well as William Zhang in the case of Civic. As class actions, they are also brought ""on behalf of all others similarly situated.""      In making their case, the plaintiffs raise the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's action against EOS maker Block.One over its over $4 billion ICO in 2018. The firm agreed to pay penalties of $24 million for conducting an unregistered securities sale in September of last year.      The plaintiffs draw comparison between tokens issued by the companies accused in the complaints and Block.One's sale of EOS.      The Binance filing states:    ""The creation of EOS tokens thus occurred through a centralized process, in contrast to Bitcoin and Ethereum. This would not have been apparent at issuance, however, to a reasonable investor. Rather, it was only after the passage of time and disclosure of additional information about the issuer’s intent, process of management, and success in allowing decentralization to arise that a reasonable purchaser could know that he or she had acquired a security.""    Other filings make similar claims of similarities between Block.One's ICO and tokens issued by defendants.      The reason the lawsuits have been brought en masse may be due to the statute of limitations in the U.S., which rules that a case over fraud must be brought within two years from a crime being discovered.      Fintech attorney Richard B. Levin told Decrypt that the complaints are likely to go to trial.      “Dismissal of a case is an extraordinary remedy,” Levin said. “I don’t believe the court will dismiss the cases, and I also do not believe the courts are going to grant motions for a summary judgment either on behalf of the plaintiffs or the defendants.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | KNC | BNB,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/06/major-crypto-firms-including-binance-civic-tron-targeted-in-flood-of-lawsuits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb68be77ce4b500d9256039d33c89a46e022418c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404386,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhzAx,1586168667,Crypto Long & Short: Is Bitcoin More Like Gold or Equities?,"In the recent market turmoil, bitcoin (BTC) did not act like the uncorrelated asset many thought it was. Nor did gold.      As things calmed down a bit (or as we got used to the new volatility), gold resumed its upward climb. But there are problems.  It turns out that gold is not as fungible as we assumed.      You're reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk's head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week — with insights and analysis — from a professional investor's point of view. You can subscribe here.  Surging demand combined with refinery closures and shipping restrictions has created a shortage of gold coins and the small gold bars most popular with retail investors. And if you do manage to source one, you’ll pay a premium to the spot price.      According to Bloomberg, spot gold traded at $1,580/oz on Wednesday, while gold coins sold for $1,786/oz and 1oz gold bars for $1,729/oz.      Gold bars and coins normally sell at a premium to spot, but the premium is apparently now more than twice its usual level in some formats, and many dealers have a waitlist. Even the kilobar, a heavier lift (geddit?) for retail investors than the smaller coins and 1oz bars, is at a much higher markup than usual.      Even larger denominations used for futures settlement are experiencing supply issues. Unusually, the London Bullion Market Authority (LBMA) and COMEX, associations based in London and New York, respectively, that jointly establish the global gold price through the trading of unallocated gold- and cash-settled futures, this week put out a joint statement reassuring the market of their gold stocks.  Yet, stories have surfaced of COMEX not being able to settle some of its futures contracts with the standard 100oz gold bar and needing to import 400oz gold bars from London. Last week, the CME Group (parent of COMEX) announced a new gold futures contract with settlement in either 100-ounce, 400-ounce or 1-kilo bars. Yet according to BullionStar, as of Friday there were no 400oz gold bars in New York.  There’s so much going on here that we could write a book, but for now it’s worth keeping an eye open for disruption in physical settlement of gold futures. It’s also worth remembering that the bitcoin market may have its problems, but actual delivery is not one of them.    Quarterly figures    The end of the first quarter of 2020 this week gives us some nice packaging to wrap around relative performance figures, and an opportunity to look at where the market might go from here.      BTC’s fall was part of a broad market rout, with sharp falls in most traditional asset classes.      As the above chart hints, BTC’s correlation to equities rose sharply, while its correlation to gold fell.      On a longer time frame, however, the BTC/Gold relationship is stronger than that of bitcoin and equities, and we expect this to become the norm again as markets settle into a new outlook.    Half gone    Unless you’ve been living under a rock recently (which would be forgivable given what’s going on), you’ll have heard of the bitcoin “halving” (or “halvening”). If you’re familiar with bitcoin technology, you’ll know what it is; if you’re not, well, buckle up.      The halving is a fascinating insight into how decentralized incentives can maintain a system of programmatic monetary policy with a hard cap. For a quick introduction, here’s our explainer (with video!). If you want more detail, over 30 charts and some in-depth miner commentary, as well as a look at what the impact on the price could be, download our free report.      Inside, you’ll see how bitcoin’s technology and its market have an intertwined relationship unlike any other asset class. Its value stems from the resilience of its protocol, which no single entity controls. In the increasingly fragile fiat system, with rules that change according to convenience, this will attract attention even if just for intellectual curiosity.  The halving will hone that attention, as it highlights just how novel bitcoin’s technology is. What’s more, it is happening at a time when fiat currency supply breaks all bounds of control. The juxtaposition is stark, and raises important questions about what constitutes value and how much we should sacrifice fundamentals for convenience.  While bitcoin’s previous two halvings preceded a strong price rally, we can’t count on this one having the same effect. The bitcoin market is markedly different than it was four years ago, with a different level of institutional involvement, a more sophisticated market structure and a greater relevance in macro trends. The reduction of selling pressure from a lesser flow of new supply may play a part, as might the narrative around the halving and the extra mainstream attention it brings.      Narratives shape sentiment which influences prices, although investors may prefer to wait for fundamentals to become more clear. But if ever there was a time when it was appropriate to focus investor attention on an alternative supply mechanism for a potential store of value, for whatever reason, it is now.    Chain links    Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world in terms of volume, has bought CoinMarketCap, the most popular crypto data site in the sector, in terms of traffic. TAKEAWAY: In an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, Binance founder and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao gave the data site’s large number of users as one of the main drivers of the deal. This hints at a renewed push into the retail crypto investment market, and a possible consolidation in the crypto market sector, with exchanges buying ancillary businesses to broaden their service and reach. It remains to be seen how this changes both CoinMarketCap’s and Binance’s offering and target market – and whether other exchanges follow suit with similar acquisitions.      Binance was also in the news for delisting leveraged tokens issued by derivatives platform FTX, which replicated a long or short position with 3x leverage. TAKEAWAY: The reason Binance gave is that users weren’t reading the small print and didn’t seem to realize that these instruments could lose them a lot of money if not handled correctly. On the other hand, FTX, in which Binance has an undisclosed stake, has not experienced similar issues. This could be because of Binance’s heavily retail user base, while FTX users are probably more sophisticated. Either way, this is an interested example of self-regulation – these tokens were profitable for the exchange in that they generated a significant amount of volume, but, you know, “protecting users comes first.”      Options market data shows a 4 percent chance of bitcoin hitting all-time highs this year, and a 16% chance of ending the year above $10,000. TAKEAWAY: Call and put spreads can be used to calculate the market’s expectations of prices at expiry, but, like all prices, they react to information and are likely to continue to move up or down as expiries near and as traditional market directions become more clear.      As interest rates drop to zero, how will stablecoin issuers cover their costs? TAKEAWAY: Dollar-backed stablecoin issuers have been making a tidy profit on the interest they earn on the deposited dollars. If that gets totally taken off the table, will they resort to raising fees? Will that impact stablecoin demand, which has been rising as more investors park excess cash in stablecoins rather than fiat currency?        Cryptocurrency exchange data firm Kaiko broke down the March 12-13 bitcoin price movements to highlight the role of liquidity in volatility. TAKEAWAY: Analyses like these help to understand the role of market depth (size of bid and ask orders) in volatility – if bids and asks can be just wiped off the board in a sharp price movement, the movement will become even sharper in the absence of support levels. On March 12-13, market depth got decimated and spreads widened significantly, which exacerbated the price slippage, volatility and sharp decline.      Analytics firm Glassnode highlights metrics that show bitcoin network activity is recovering after the crash. TAKEAWAY: I love network metrics – to think that we can get an almost-real-time look at what is actually happening under an asset’s hood in terms of movement, accumulation and adoption… The increase of active addresses and number of small transactions suggests that panic is subsiding. And a historical comparison of more esoteric metrics such as net unrealized profit (NUPL) and market value vs realized value (MVRV) hint that the bitcoin price has reached a bottom.      Coinbase points the finger at leverage in the crypto sector as the main culprit of the March 12 crash. TAKEAWAY: I agree – many accounts claimed that it was due to a fire-sale of any liquid asset to raise liquidity for margin calls elsewhere. While there may have been some of that, we haven’t seen much evidence. And if it were the case, it would imply a much greater crypto presence than we had realized of large institutional investors. Also, it does not make intuitive sense that institutions would exit a highly volatile asset on the way down, knowing it would be difficult to get back in at a similar price, unless they really had no other more liquid and less volatile assets in their portfolio – an unlikely scenario. Leverage in bitcoin derivatives is relatively steep, especially on the larger exchanges, which leaves traders more vulnerable to margin calls than in other assets. And the sharp drop in open interest shows how much the crash affected the leveraged derivatives market.      After the rout of mid-March, several exchanges have reported a sharp uptick in new user signups. Kraken, for instance, saw an 83% increase in signups, Luno had 50% more active users, and peer-to-peer crypto exchange Paxful doubled its signup rate. TAKEAWAY: Is this a sign of people wanting to hedge against the fragility of the fiat system? Or is it a sign of lockdown boredom, in which anything with sanitary risk holds appeal?      Amid market turmoil and talk in traditional markets of circuit breakers, short-selling bans and even total market shutdowns, there have been some mutterings about applying similar measures to crypto markets. TAKEAWAY: They will forever be just mutterings, though – crypto markets can’t close, no matter what, and that’s a good thing.      Open-source code platform GitHub has buried the Bitcoin Core code in an abandoned coal mine in an Arctic mountain. TAKEAWAY: To add to the overall apocalyptic feel of the times.... (I’m kidding.

42404373,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhyz9,1586167200,Victims Accuse Wells Fargo Subsidiary of Turning Blind Eye to $35M Crypto Ponzi,"Victims of an alleged crypto ponzi scam have filed a class-action lawsuit against a Wells Fargo subsidiary, claiming it ignored the activities of an employee accused of being one of the main perpetrators.      The plaintiffs said Wells Fargo Advisors did not inquire into the activities of James Seijas who, while working as a Wells Fargo financial adviser, allegedly defrauded 150 investors out of a total of $35 million.      According to the lawsuit, Seijas, along with two co-founders, Quan Tran, a certified general surgeon, and Michael Ackerman, who had previously worked at UBS Securities, formed a scheme called Q3 in 2017, ostensibly as a means to pool funds together to trade cryptocurrencies.      The Florida-based group encouraged investors, primarily doctors in Tran's network, to participate by depositing funds. On initially raising more than $1 million, the group then began turning Q3 into a limited partnership and branched out by raising an additional $33 million from 150 investors all around the U.S., the suit alleged.      The plaintiffs alleged Q3 only invested $10 million into cryptocurrencies, with the rest going straight to the founders. A $4 million licensing fee, supposedly for a trading algorithm, actually ended up in their personal bank accounts, the suit said.      Seijas worked as a financial adviser for Wells Fargo Advisors for more than five years, only leaving in May 2019 according to his LinkedIn profile. The plaintiffs claimed in their lawsuit that he often told potential investors he worked at Wells Fargo to encourage them to invest in Q3.      The plaintiffs claim Wells Fargo should have checked on Seijas' activity, as per their policy requiring employees to regularly report activities stemming from outside interests. Q3IRV says Wells Fargo Advisors did not inquire into Seijas' role at Q3 during this time.      See also: Crypto Scams Pose More Risk Than Payments Fraud, Report Suggests      Although Q3 claimed it was averaging 15 percent monthly profits, the lawsuit says money not siphoned to personal accounts was mostly lost speculating on the market.      ""Despite Defendants' representation to potential and existing Q3 Investors that their virtual currency trading was highly successful and that Q3 Investors were free to withdraw the profits earned in their accounts after one year, Defendants did not trade virtual currencies successfully and most of Q3 Investors' money was misappropriated or lost in trading,"" reads the filing.      But most of the funds were apparently spent on lavish lifestyles. Seijas and his wife allegedly spent $3.5 million of investors' money on a house in Florida. Tran allegedly spent $1.4 million on a yacht, and $260,000 on a Bentley; Ackerman reportedly purchased three cars, another $600,000 on personal security, and a further $100,000 on Tiffany jewelry.      The plaintiffs have accused Wells Fargo Advisors, as well as Seijas, Tran, and Ackerman, of fraud, negligence and unjust enrichment. The group also accuses the Q3 founders of counts including conspiracy to commit fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Wells Fargo is also accused, specifically, of one count of vicarious liability.      The plaintiffs' call for a trial by jury. If successful, they say Wells Fargo Advisors should pay punitive damages as well as legal costs.

42404368,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhyxB,1586160000,New Software Fix Offers Bitcoin Miners Increased Security,"The company behind the world's sixth-largest bitcoin mining pool has released software that aims to patch several security problems with such pools.      The software, included in the BOSminer software suite, is the first working implementation of Stratum V2, the protocol that Prague-based startup Braiins released a specification for in 2019. With this software release, the company’s effort to fix bitcoin mining is no longer theoretical; it's been turned into functioning code.      ""The importance of it is that it's the first real-life code or product using V2, so real bitcoin is being mined by using it,"" Braiins co-founder and co-CEO Pavel Moravec told CoinDesk.      The most profitable way to mine bitcoin is not to do it alone, but to hook up to a so-called mining pool, combine efforts with other miners, and get paid for the total computing power they contributed.      But there are issues with Stratum, the industry standard used to connect miners to pools since 2012. Braiins aims to fix them with Stratum V2.      Braiins co-founder and co-CEO Jan Capek stressed that miners gain security and efficiency in terms of bandwidth if they run the software.      This might seem like a meager consolation to miners, who have taken a hit to their paycheck since bitcoin's (BTC) price dipped. Not to mention that bitcoin's halving is approaching, which will cut their rewards in half.      See also:Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Slush Pool (operated by Braiins) now has the software set up so miners can connect to them in this new way, providing better privacy for them and building in protections from so-called hijacking attacks, where other entities temporarily steal their hashing power.      If all goes according to plan, the protocol could gain more adopters soon. The EMCD mining pool, for example, is experimenting with the protocol.    Still to come    While the new release pushes important mining changes forward, the full specification has not been turned into code yet.      The community can still provide feedback on the specifications, Moravec said. If Stratum V2 is to become an industry standard, the community needs to agree with the included changes.      While this initial version brings security benefits to miners, it's important to note that the most exciting change, ""job negotiation,"" which could have positive consequences for bitcoin as a whole, is not yet implemented in this software.      Job negotiation, if adopted, could return ""voting"" power over Bitcoin protocol upgrades, which mining pools currently have, back to individual miners.      By doing so, it could help decentralize mining in one sense by redistributing power from pools to the miners they are composed of.      (However, there are other ways in which the bitcoin ecosystem is still centralized. For example, only a few companies manufacture the hardware run by miners to create bitcoin.)      The feature will be added at a later date, which Braiins did not specify.      To make job negotiation work most efficiently, Capek said a ""template distribution interface"" needs to be added to Bitcoin Core, by far the most popular bitcoin full node software.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/06/new-software-fix-offers-bitcoin-miners-increased-security,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ba1d7991e30c3cd763da6c1ae01eb6b28146a81-1024x775.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404381,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhz71,1586134807,Crypto M&amp;A and Fundraising Dropped Sharply in 2019: PwC Report,"Crypto companies kept buying each other last year even as both M&A and funding deal flow in the industry took a dive, according to a report released Monday by PwC.      On the M&A side, crypto-native acquirers took 56 percent of the deal flow, compared to 42 percent in 2018. The total number of M&A deals flagged by the report dropped from 189 in 2018 to 114 last year, while the value of M&A deals dropped by a whopping 76 percent from $1.9 billion to $451 million.      Larger companies were able to eat up ones that provided services that were ancillary to their own, PwC Global Crypto Lead Henri Arslanian told CoinDesk in an interview.      “I think we should expect some of the big players to get bigger, but not by buying direct competitors,” Arslanian said. “Not by becoming vertically bigger but by becoming horizontally bigger. Unicorns are becoming more like octopuses where they have their hands in various areas of the crypto ecosystem.”      Meanwhile, the declines on the fundraising side of the report weren’t quite as stark. Post-seed rounds took up eight percentage points more of overall fundraising deals in 2019, a sign of the sector’s maturation.      “I think that’s something we should expect to see as well, as the industry matures, there will be enough deal flow and there will be enough exits as well to allow many of the crypto VCs to be successful,” he said.      Fundraising overall decreased by 40 percent to $2.24 billion and the number of deals dropped by 122. Equity fundraising decreased by less, showing only an 18 percent drop. The rise of bitcoin in the second and third quarter of 2019 didn’t stave off the funding drop, and the industry should assume going into 2020 that the global economic downturn will further affect funding deals, the report said.      Last year did see a doubling of corporate venture capital involvement, taking up 6 percent of the deals. As clear regulatory frameworks in Europe and Asia begin to develop, more institutional players are taking notice. Family offices with long-term investment strategies that Arslanian advises continue to show more interest in crypto over time, he said.      The type of companies receiving investment also changed year-to-year. In 2018, most VC funding went to blockchain infrastructure projects while crypto compliance and regulatory companies saw the most investment in 2019.      Deal flow is also moving away from the Americas and towards Asia and Europe, which increased their deal share by eight and six percentage points, respectively. Last year was the first year most of the crypto fundraising and M&A deals happened outside of the U.S.      Companies looking for new institutional clients are flocking to Hong Kong while firms looking for a retail audience are considering Singapore’s new regulatory framework, Arslanian added.      “We’ve definitely seen a number of the large players from the U.S. and from Europe really look at Asia not only from an expansion perspective but also as a point of fundraising from strategic investors,” he said.
