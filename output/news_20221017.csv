Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Cryptos Point Upward Amid Renewed Interest in Riskier Assets  By James Rubin  Investors continued a cautious return to riskier assets, sending bitcoin and other cryptos higher for a second consecutive day.  But how long the mini-surge lasts remains to be seen.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading above $19,500, up about 1.4% over the past 24 hours, swept up in a wider, likely temporary embrace of more traditional markets. Ether also recently rose about the same and was recently changing hands over $1,300. Other major altcoins spent much of the day in the green, with ATOM and MATIC among the biggest gainers for cryptos with at least a $1 billion market cap, each rising about 5%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, is up 1.20%.  Crypto prices dovetailed with equity market increases as the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a heavy technology component, jumped 3.4% and 2.6%, respectively, amid continued worries about inflation and the future of the global economy. Investors will be scrutinizing third quarter earnings, which are now in full swing with Bank of America, the second largest bank in the U.S. reporting an 8% decline in profitability on Monday and Goldman Sachs and Tesla among the global brands scheduled to report later this week.  The fallout from the collapse of now bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital continued with the liquidators in the case seeking authorization to serve subpoenas to the firm’s co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies by alternate means, according to a court filing on Friday. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now examining whether the firm violated rules by misleading investors about its balance sheet and not registering with the two agencies, according to a Bloomberg story.  Less risky than credit default swaps?  In a weekly crypto report, Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto-focused financial services firm Arca, noted that sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) had ""blown out this year worldwide, indicating the risk of default has risen, or at least, the cost to insure this low probability outcome has increased significantly."" CDSs are financial contracts in which purchasers of corporate or sovereign bonds try to eradicate possible losses stemming from a bond issuer defaulting. Dorman wrote that CDSs tend to be a more accurate measure of risk than bonds themselves.  ""Bitcoin has always been a call option on anarchy if citizens begin to lose faith in their banks and local governments,"" Dorman wrote. ""In fact, in February 2022, when Russia’s Ruble tanked and Canadian banks froze citizens’ accounts, we highlighted that it would not be surprising if demand for bitcoin skyrocketed. This prediction is even more relevant now with European banks imploding, England’s currency and bond market eroding, and Japan’s yield curve control flummoxing investors.""  He added: ""Paying a one-time fee of just under $20,000 for bitcoin doesn’t seem that expensive. Perhaps we should stop looking at bitcoin as an inflation hedge or store of value and start valuing it as wealth and livelihood protection. It’s certainly counterintuitive that bitcoin and sovereign CDS serve the same purpose, yet one is more expensive due to very real increased risks (CDS) while the other is on sale for 70% off its recent all-time highs.""

By Sam Reynolds  Macau’s Executive Council has passed a bill creating a legal framework for the territory to begin accepting digital currency. But what does this mean for the gambling industry, which relies on a strong local privacy framework and a steady supply of gamblers?  Macau, one of China’s two Special Administrative Regions (SAR), tends to be the more obedient territory than its cousin, the erstwhile British territory of Hong Kong. Macau is smaller and more focused: Its entire economy is based around gambling. While Macau is an autonomous legal jurisdiction (after all, gambling is illegal in mainland China) there’s not the same interest in contesting Beijing’s rule as in Hong Kong because of the divergent history of the two SARs. Consider: Census data from 2016 shows that just over 55% of Hong Kong can speak English while less than 1% of Macau speaks Portuguese.  But local law still prevails in Macau, which has what UNSW Australia Faculty of Law Professor Graham Greenleaf called some of the strongest data protection laws in Asia, in a 2014 paper on the topic.  There’s a ban on recording images and sounds in casinos, and in 2019 Macau’s Director of Gaming Inspection warned casino operators that their use of facial recognition, RFID-enabled casino chips and digitally enabled baccarat tables – all of which are used to give the house an edge – must conform to Macau’s Personal Data Protection Law. Consent for collection would be required, as would best practices like removing personally identifiable information before sending it to a third party. Gamblers prefer discretion.  But that’s Macanese law, of which Beijing respects but doesn’t approve. Beijing doesn’t want to be seen as rescinding the guarantees of autonomy it promised with The Basic Law of Macau, the territory’s mini-Constitution, but at the same time it doesn’t want its people gambling there. In 2021, China’s criminal law was amended with a supranational flavor. Gambling is now illegal for its citizens overseas.  Later in 2021, China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism banned the organizing of tour groups to “cross-border gambling tourist destinations,” which includes Macau and other regional gambling hubs like Sihanoukville, Cambodia.  Macau embracing China’s digital currency is the logical conclusion of all of this. Macau’s own currency isn’t widely used, even at home, as it pegs the Hong Kong dollar 1:1 to the Macanese pataca, with the HKD being the currency of choice on casino floors. There’s a precedent to using a ""foreign"" currency for gambling, so there’s not much of a leap required to embrace a version of China’s digital currency in the territory.  Digital currency as a tool for oversight  And for Beijing, it gives bureaucrats, as well as law enforcement, much more granular insight into the gambling industry while bypassing Macau’s strong privacy laws. Beijing knows it can’t eliminate the gambling industry entirely in Macau because it would decimate the local economy, so better off controlling it instead via its central bank digital currency. Foreign nationals may be allowed to keep using cash, but Chinese nationals would need to use this digital currency in order to keep being allowed at casinos.  Macau has nothing to lose. Once upon a time, at the peak of China’s boom, the territory netted more gambling revenue than Las Vegas. But COVID-19 changed things.  Macau’s casinos are estimated to bring in $680 million in revenue for October, which should be its busiest month because of China’s Golden Week mega holiday. In contrast, the latest data available from Nevada shows Vegas cleared just over $1 billion in revenue for August, with the Las Vegas Strip reporting a 5% year-over-year increase.  With things looking so dire, how can Macau say no?

42434991,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGndif,1666039608,Market Wrap: Bitcoin and Ether Start the Week Higher,"Price Action  Bitcoin and ether started the week in positive territory as risk assets of various stripes rose. Macroeconomic data will be relatively light this week, although markets will be eyeing Wednesday’s inflation data from Great Britain along with U.S. housing starts on the same day.  Bitcoin (BTC) rose 1.4% on Monday on moderate volume as the price at one point reached as high as $19,670. BTC began a steady ascent early Monday, rising for five consecutive hours before retracing.  Ether’s (ETH) price increased 1.3% as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continued to hover above $1,300. ETH pushed higher during the 13:00 UTC (9:00 a.m. ET) hour before declining, and reached as high as 1,337. ETH is up approximately 0.01% since Oct. 8, when the asset became deflationary for the first time since the Sept. 15 Ethereum Merge upgrade from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, is up 1.33%.  The top altcoin gainers recently were Polymath Network’s POLY and Injective Protocol’s INJ, which rose 27% and 13%, respectively. The laggards on the day were Index Chain’s IDX and XYO Network’s XYO.  Macro View  The overriding narrative in crypto continues to be its connection with macroeconomic news, particularly on inflation and economic growth. The Oct. 27 release of GDP data will show whether the U.S. economy remains in a recession.  The CME FedWatch tool data shows the possibility of a 50 basis point interest rate hike, although the probability remains low at just 4.6%. The larger takeaway is that a 100 basis point hike no longer seems to be a possibility. Markets are currently assigning a 95% probability the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee will increase rates by 75 basis points in November.  Traditional financial markets were higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 1.8%, 3.5% and 2.7%, respectively.  In commodities, energy markets were mixed. West Texas Intermediate crude and European Brent crude were up 0.57% and 0.61%, while natural gas declined 7.2%. In metals, safe-haven gold rose 1.3% while copper futures increased 0.26%.  Latest Prices  ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): 952.78 +1.0%        ● Bitcoin (BTC): $19,519 +1.0%        ● Ether (ETH): $1,325 +1.1%        ● S&P 500 daily close: 3,677.95 +2.6%        ● Gold: $1,654 per troy ounce +0.7%        ● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 4.01% +0.005        Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  BTC trades near 20-day short-term average, maintains inverse relationship to US dollar  Bitcoin traded higher on Monday but stalled as it neared its 20-day moving average. This has been a recurring theme with BTC because the price has essentially traded sideways since mid-June.  By most technical indicators, BTC still appears poised to trade in its current range in the absence of any dramatic catalysts. Recent data releases, such as the Consumer Price Index report last Thursday, have been relatively non-eventful in the aggregate – providing price volatility intraday before reverting to prior levels.  BTC’s price has breached its 10-day moving average, while the 10-day average appears poised to cross the 20-day moving average. Moving average crossovers are often viewed as bullish signals when they occur to the upside, and bearish when they occur to the downside.  Accounting for BTC’s Bollinger Bands implies, however, that BTC is merely continuing a pattern of moving slightly above the average price before declining, and subsequently moving slightly below average before rising again.  The clearest indication of BTC price movement continues to be its relationship to the U.S. dollar, specifically its inverse relationship to the dollar index (DXY). The correlation coefficient between BTC and the DXY is currently -0.81.  The correlation coefficient measures pricing relationships between assets, with 1 representing a direct relationship and -1 indicating a completely inverse relationship. The maximum negative correlation between the two assets was -0.94 in September.  On-chain data is providing early tea leaves that larger BTC holders may be preparing to sell. This would be consistent with recent BTC behavior where profits are scalped after a brief increase above its moving average.  Glassnode’s measurement of “whale” net inflows to exchanges has moved into positive territory after being negative for the prior 30 days. A “whale” is a unique bitcoin entity holding more than 1,000 BTC. Because of their size, whales can sway prices.  The movement of BTC on to exchanges by large investors can signal bearish sentiment, as investors move BTC to exchanges in preparation of selling it.

42434977,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGndYr,1666034986,Crypto Venture Capital Fund Paradigm Also Wants CFTC to Serve Ooki DAO's Members,"Crypto venture capital fund Paradigm Operations has asked a federal court for permission to join two other groups in arguing that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) should serve the members of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) directly, rather than through a generic website help portal.  Paradigm filed for permission to join Ooki DAO's case on Monday, arguing in a motion that the CFTC's view that any voting token holder who participated in the DAO's governance process is liable may threaten DAOs in general. The company is hoping to file an amicus, or friend of the court, brief and included its proposed amicus filing.  The CFTC filed suit against Ooki DAO last month in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging the DAO was violating federal commodities laws by offering U.S. residents access to unregistered leveraged and margin crypto trading products. The DAO has since geofenced users whose IP addresses are located within the U.S., but has not responded to the CFTC in court as of press time.  While the crypto industry has not tried to defend against the actual allegations – that the DAO, with its predecessor company, bZeroX, offered unregistered products to U.S. customers – it has collectively expressed concern about how the CFTC has gone about trying to bring a case against the DAO. Specifically, lawyers are concerned that the CFTC has painted with a broad brush by trying to hold each voting token holder individually liable, as well as by trying to serve the entire DAO by posting the lawsuit in a web portal and on a forum.  ""A key characteristic of DAOs is that unrelated, anonymous people come together to decide whether to adopt ad hoc proposals about how to run the underlying protocol. A person might choose to participate once or many times, but the community of people making decisions on the DAO is fluid, ever-changing and different for each proposal on which they vote,"" Paradigm's filing said Monday.  Trying to define all voting token holders as the members of the same association ""threatens to seriously distort the law,"" the crypto investment fund claimed.  ""The Commission’s action appears designed to produce a default judgment. By admitting that it has not located any individual token holders in the 'Ooki DAO' while threatening to hold token holders jointly and severally liable, the Commission has created a strong disincentive for anyone to appear and defend this action. And indeed, no defendant has yet appeared,"" the filing said in the proposed amicus brief.  LeXpunK Army and the DeFi Education Fund have already filed for permission to add similar amicus briefs. LeXpunK's brief is due in court by the end of the day.  While District Judge William Orrick had previously ruled that the CFTC could serve the DAO through the web portal, he allowed the two parties to join the case, setting a hearing in November to allow the different parties to present their arguments.

Aptos is the brainchild of several ex-Meta employees who pioneered the company’s failed diem stablecoin. The Aptos blockchain’s code is written with Move, the Rust-based programming language favored by Mysten Labs' Sui blockchain, another upcoming network.  While Aptos Labs has declared its network ""live,"" its ecosystem is far from completed, with dozens of teams yet to launch the wallets, trading venues and non-fungible token tech essential to decentralized finance (DeFi). Until those – and a token – debut, there won't be much to do on Aptos  The blockchain itself is up and running, having completed its ""genesis transaction"" on Oct. 12. Even so, the infrastructure has proven rocky; People building within Aptos told CoinDesk the mainnet rollout was ""rushed.""  The buzzed-about blockchain first made headlines in March after securing $200 million in a funding round led by a16z, with major investors including Tiger Global, Katie Haun, Multicoin Capital, FTX Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Binance Labs and PayPal Ventures rushing in to finance the project.  That flood of investor dollars was quickly followed by another gold rush when, in July, Aptos closed a $150 million Series A round led by FTX Ventures and Jump Crypto, with participation from Binance Labs. The second funding round set the company’s. reported valuation at $2 billion, four times higher than the company’s previous valuation just six months earlier.  Living up to that lofty valuation may prove pivotal to Aptos' stated goal of becoming the home for Web3.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization tracked U.S. equity indexes, which also climbed with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500, recently up 3.5%, and 2.7%, respectively, as investors awaited the latest third-quarter earnings reports and housing data that seem likely to reflect a continued cooling of the real estate market. On Monday, Bank of America became the latest financial services giant to report sagging results, joining Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, among others.  “The gains [of bitcoin] today mirror those in equity markets, with risk assets more broadly getting the week off to a good start,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Monday note.  The CoinDesk Market Index was up 0.9% as of press time. Ether (ETH) rose 2.7% to around $1,320.  Monday’s crypto gains also dovetailed with U.K. stocks, which jumped after the country’s treasury chief scrappedhotly criticized tax cut plans that had unsettled investors.  The overall market improvement also resulted from a recent U.S. dollar index (DXY) correction, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, said.  The DXY index, which measures the value of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, recently sank 1.1%, reversing a recent trend, according to MarketWatch’s data.  “Cryptocurrency prices have been positively correlated to the equity markets, so we would expect an oversold bounce in the equity market to benefit cryptocurrencies broadly,” said Will Tamplin, senior analyst at technical research firm Fairlead Strategies.

42434974,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGndYF,1666030945,Binance to Launch Cloud Mining Business in November,"The world's largest crypto exchange by volume, Binance continues its push into the embattled crypto mining industry with a plan to begin offering a crypto cloud mining product next month.  Crypto miners have had a tough year, with the price of bitcoin having hung around $20,000 for months, a far cry from its peak above $68,000 in November 2021. Other cryptos have faced similar or even worse declines. One of the largest mining-related firms in the U.S. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late September.  Other companies, however, are seeing opportunity from this crisis, with CleanSpark going on a buying spree of mining rigs and data centers, and decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Maple Finance starting a $300 million lending pool.  Binance Pool announced its own $500 million lending fund for bitcoin miners last week and said it would enter cloud mining, a service that allows investors – who otherwise might not be able to buy and operate their own equipment – to rent crypto mining machines. The official launch of the cloud mining service will come in November, a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk via email on Monday.  The move opens a front of competition with Jihan Wu's Bitdeer, a cloud mining operator that also launched a $250 million fund to buy distressed assets in late September. Wu is the ousted co-founder of Bitmain, the largest manufacturer of crypto mining machines in the world. Another big player in the cloud mining space is BitFuFu, backed by Bitmain's other founder, Ketuan Zhan.  Bitdeer and BitFuFu sell a mix of their own and others' self-operated computing power, or hashrate. In its blog post announcing its own move into the business, Binance Pool said it would be buying hashrate from third parties, likely meaning that it wouldn't be operating its own infrastructure.  ""As one of the top mining pools in the world, Binance Pool will not only operate as a mining pool but also will take responsibility for contributing to building a healthy industry, especially during an uncertain market conditions,"" the Binance spokesperson said.

42434982,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGndcX,1666030323,"The Next Major Ethereum Upgrade, Shanghai, Now Has a Testnet","Ethereum developers can start testing out their next upgrades to the protocol on the new “Shandong” test network (testnet).  The Shanghai upgrade, for which Shandong is the testnet, is projected to happen at some point in 2023. It will be Ethereum’s first upgrade since the Merge in September, when Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake model.  Right now, some Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) being considered for inclusion in Shanghai could address some efficiency and scalability issues. Perhaps the most anticipated proposal is EIP 4895, which will allow for those who have staked ether (ETH) on the Beacon Chain to withdraw their stake, along with any rewards they have earned over time.  Right now, anyone who staked ether as part of the validator process on the Beacon Chain has not been able to withdraw their stake or their rewards directly. Instead, anyone hoping to access those funds has had to rely on liquidity tokens representing their assets.  Also under consideration is EIP 4844, which introduces proto-danksharding. This proposal will allow for more data to be processed on the network and therefore decrease gas prices.  EIP 3540, which is related to one of the EIPs included in Ethereum’s London upgrade (EIP 3541), will deal with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the software that is used for Ethereum smart contracts. This proposal will allow for code and data to be separated, and will make it easier for future changes to be made to EVM.  Parithosh Jayanthi, a DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk that “the Shandong testnet is meant to give developers a chance to try out the potential EIPs to find issues.”  The final list of EIPs that will be considered for inclusion in the Shanghai upgrade won’t be finalized for a while. Jayanthi said, “I think it’ll be one of the major talking points once All Core Developers calls start again.”  Read more: Ethereum After the Merge: What Comes Next?",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/17/the-next-major-ethereum-upgrade-shanghai-now-has-a-testnet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de4e72227c353ffe73111cf7952c48993e62edc0-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the crypto world, bridges is software that allows users to transfer assets between different blockchains. This type of software has been one of the most targeted parts of decentralized-finance (DeFi) platforms, Grauer added.  “The perception around that is not that there’s a honey pot of money, but a lot of funds stored in one place that are backing funds on another blockchain,” she said.  Read more: $114M Mango Markets Exploiter Outs Himself, Returns Most of the Money  Non-centralized storage of money combined with bridge accessibility has made the software “a target,” she added.  According to Chainalysis, October has become the worst month for crypto hacks, with upward of $718 million being lost due to security-related crimes, and there's still two weeks left in the month.  That poses a “reputational risk” for investors and users, Grauer said, citing the most recent hack – which saw more than $100 million fizzle out of Mango, a DeFi platform that's based on the Solana blockchain (before eventually being returned) – as an example that could decrease consumer confidence in crypto.  “In order for people to comfortably invest in DeFi protocols,” industry figures must figure out better ways to build trust in blockchain technology by working together and making cybersecurity a priority, she said.  “It’s not just one protocol that was hacked that has impact, but it’s also the fact that you’re less eager to invest in an existing new protocol because the hacking concept is looming in your mind,” Grauer said.

The news, announced in a U.K. regulatory filing, comes as the wholly owned Gemini subsidiary maps out its expansion into known tax haven Ireland.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  No formal reason was given for Winklevoss’ move, but it comes amid a wave of C-Suite shuffling across the digital asset industry. Growing regulatory challenges as well as a multi-month long market rout have led to a number of resignations.  Among the most notable departures or downsizings, for very different reasons, are Genesis CEO Michael Moro, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell, all announced in recent weeks. Alameda Research co-CEO Sam Trabucco also stepped down, as did FTX.US President Brett Harrison.  Then there’s Celsius’ Alex Mashinsky and Daniel Leon, who served as the now-bankrupt crypto neobank’s chief executive and chief strategy officer, respectively. The crypto lender is going through a difficult Chapter 11 restructuring, and it seems likely that Mashinsky could face lawsuits.  The reasons for these exoduses vary on a case by case basis. In many instances it seems like individual attempts to save face after making bad business decisions, or a result of pressure from a company’s board or owners.  Moro threw in the towel, for instance, after Genesis got in bed with the overzealous and potentially criminal hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which apparently lost the institutional-facing lending firm Genesis a whopping $1.2 billion. Genesis, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group.  Michael Saylor, the long-time CEO of business intelligence company MicroStrategy, directed the firm’s first bitcoin purchase in 2020 and essentially transformed the firm into a BTC investment trust.  MicroStrategy’s BTC buys seemed prescient in 2020, ahead of the bull run – and was even said to catalyze other corporate entities into holding bitcoin “on the balance sheet” as a hedge against inflation – but are now deeply in the red. Saylor kept buying, even as the market turned against him, while most other publicly listed firms have not. He remains at MicroStrategy as executive chairman.  Kraken’s Powell founded the exchange in 2011 and has long been known as one of crypto’s most ideologically driven executives. This year, the libertarian-leaning former CEO was accused of fostering a toxic workplace culture after making offhand remarks and setting “anti-Woke” policies.  Powell, like Saylor, said he’s stepping down as CEO to continue focusing on crypto advocacy. In some cases, these shifts work out. David Marcus, who oversaw the Libra project at Facebook, before both were renamed, has emerged as a thoughtful industry commentator and CEO of Bitcoin Lightning-focused Lightspark.

Bear markets, where the goal is to merely survive as users and capital flood out, require an entirely different set of managerial skills than bull markets, where growth and market dominance seem to be all that matters.  The tricky thing with crypto, however, is that management can be hard to hire. Many companies, particularly Coinbase, have relied on hiring from within due to the complexities of the industry. Decent managers need to have an understanding of crypto’s technicalities as well as the gumption to lead in such a volatile market.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/17/why-are-so-many-crypto-execs-leaving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/214d5bb07c0a5c95c5b238987b72f18132ef93be-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394186,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvY3kL,1666025275,Inside a Social DAO: How an Online Community Becomes a Digital City,"If I was part of any DAO, I would want it to be “Friends With Benefits.” It is just so darn cool. As a vortex of creative energy and cultural innovation, the purpose of its existence seems to be to have fun. FWB is a curated decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) filled with DJs, artists and musicians with banging distribution channels for writing, non-fungible token (NFT) art and more.  FWB’s vision is to equip cultural creators with “the community and Web3 tools they need gain agency over their production” by:  Making the concepts and tools of Web3 more accessible  Building diverse spaces and experiences that creatively empower participants  Developing tools, artwork and products that showcase Web3’s potential  The DAO has already made significant progress towards this mission, with some of its members finding major success in the art world. One example is Eric Hu, whose generative AI butterfly art “Monarch” raised $2.5 million in presale funds alone.  Kelsie Nabben is the recipient of a PhD scholarship at the RMIT University ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making & Society and a researcher in the Blockchain Innovation Hub and Digital Ethnography Research Centre. She actively contributes to open-source research network Metagov and DAO Research Collective.  The DAO crosses from the digital realm to the physical via its members-only ticketed events around the world, including exclusive parties in Miami, Paris and New York. The latest of these events was “FWB Fest,” a three-day festival in a forest two hours east of Los Angeles.  FWB wants to grow in a decentralized way by having its members run local events around the world based on the FWB Fest model. But the problem is that FWB’s governance and funding isn’t exactly decentralized, which is paradoxical to its mission.  A social DAO  The DAO essentially meets online via the chat app Discord, where it has various interest channels including fashion, music and art. FWB is the native token of the DAO, and anyone with 5 FWB can become a local member, which grants them access to Discord channels, a newsletter, livestreamed event content and other semi-exclusive perks. To become a global member, one must fill out an application, pass an interview with one of the 20-30 rotating members of the FWB Host Committee, and then purchase 75 FWB at market price. Membership also provides access to a token-gated event app called Gatekeeper, an NFT gallery, a Web3-focused editorial outlet and in-person party and festival events. According to the community dashboard, the current treasury is $18.26 million.  See also: Bitcoin Is Macro, but Not ‘Correlated’ in the Way You Think | Opinion  FWB started as an experiment amongst friends in the creative industries who wanted to learn about crypto. The original founder of the DAO is a hyper-connected Los Angeles music artist and entrepreneur named Trevor McFedries. While traveling as a full-time band manager, he followed the rise of bitcoin, using his paid time off to locate bitcoin ATMs and talk to weird internet people. Trevor wanted to run an experiment by “airdropping” a made-up cryptocurrency token to his influencer and community-building friends. He knew a lot of people deep in tech, venture capital and creative spaces, and soon FWB took off. According to early core team member Jose, Trevor is “not around anymore” but showed up at FWB Fest and was “just blown away” at the growth and progress of the project.  The FWB team realized it was becoming more legitimate as more and more people wanted in during the DAO wave of 2021-2022. COVID-19 only compounded this, as people longed for social connection while in quarantine. When those interested in joining extended beyond friends of friends, FWB launched an application process. Now, the DAO has nearly 6,000 members around the world.  FWB Fest was described as “an immersive conference and festival experience at the intersection of culture and Web3,” aka two days of non-stop friends and benefits in a forest in Idyllwild, two hours east of Los Angeles. With a vision for an online community to meet offline to forge a “digital city IRL,” the event was set to be the Web3 retreat of the year.  Read more: What DAO Governance Has in Common With the ‘Eggheads’ Who Call a Recession | Opinion  Building a digital city  The story of how I got to FWB Fest is the same as everybody else’s. I first got connected through a friend who told me about the FWB Discord. One of the core team members from FWB, Jose, then invited me to speak at FWB Fest based on a piece I wrote for CoinDesk on crypto and live-action role playing (LARPing). FWB members on Twitter officially nicknamed the event “LARP FOREST.”  LARPing refers to games where participants physically portray characters by wearing costumes, assuming personas, and pursuing goals within real-world environments while interacting with other players in character. LARPs can range in size from a few participants to large public events with thousands of people. Games can be designed for educational or political purposes with the goal of awakening or shaping thinking. Ultimately, they can change how we organize and interact across digital and physical spaces. In this way, FWB Fest served as a LARP in cultural innovation, peer-to-peer economies, and decentralized self-governance.  The vision of FWB Fest was to build an immersive offline town. As the FWB team wrote in an email newsletter leading up to the festival: “What happens when a Discord group chat moves into a 200 acre Arts Academy in the woods? Join us at FWB FEST, where our digital internet city will come to life for three days and turn into an offline town.”  At first, the idea of FWB community members buying a ticket to hear an academic like me speak was amusing. But then I noticed the other speakers – including Kei Kruetler, author and innovator at Gnosis Guild; Glen Weyl, infamous co-author with Vitalik Buterin and radical markets crypto-politician; and Pussy Riot, the feminist band that got arrested for playing punk music in a church in Moscow in protest against President Vladimir Putin. Why were researchers, radical politics advocates and feminist activist bands being recruited to speak at a festival?  When I heard that attendees were also contributing their creative talents, I wanted to as well. So I decided to create an ethnography of the FWB community and answer the question: What is the purpose of a social DAO?  The road to Idyllwild  As I drove my rental car to the Idyllwild Arts Academy, I wondered why people had come from all around the world to be here. Was this forest festival of any benefit to the broader community? Was there a political call to action or an underlying theme or message? Or was it just a big party?  The event was the ultimate self-organizing ad hoc network, with DJ sets, art installations, tea ceremonies and a livestream. This was not just a pop-up economy but a pop-up city. Micro economies emerged within it. Although the FWB team developed its own merch for the event, member @sister_jam beat it with his own, cooler merch for sale via cash, crypto or Venmo in the Discord chat.  I wondered if the FWB digital city had the political ambitions of a “network state” – an online community that garners enough resources and influence to compete with nation-state level actors for diplomatic influence. Although FWB does reportedly have $18.26 million of funds in the DAO's treasury, I don’t think its intention is to compete with nation-states. In practice, FWB’s ambitions extend about as far as collectively crowdfunding the purchase of one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in LA, which the DAO ultimately decided against.  The ephemeral quality of the event was perfectly encapsulated by a group “star gazing” session on the final evening. As I witnessed my first meteor shower, I recognized it would be here one moment and gone the next, but the impact would be lasting. FWB Fest provided a road map for future FWB events to take the concept and push it even further.  Read more: Why Traditional Investors May Not Love DAOs | Opinion  “Our culture is very soft,” stated Dexter, a core team member during his talk with Glen Weyl on the richness of computational tools and social network data. It is a gentle way to learn about Web3, where peoples’ knowledge and experience are at all levels, questions are OK and the main focus is shared creative interests, with just a hint of Web3.  The DAO provides something for people to coalesce around. It serves as a nexus, larger than the personal connections of its founder, where intersectional connections of creativity collide in curated moments of serendipity. FWB DAO creates trust through reputation, as friends are often told about the DAO from other friends and then vetted through an application process. Having pre-verified friends scales trust in a safe and accessible way.  The next plan is to provide a way for members to host their own FWB events, which will help the DAO scale its impact. Provisioning tools like the Gatekeeper ticketing app (built by core team member Dexter, a musician and self-taught software developer) provide a pattern to enable community members to take ownership of running their own events by managing ticketing in the style and culture of FWB.  Yet, now that FWB has built this city (both digitally and physically), how will it be governed and sustained? Its challenge is to imbed decentralized governance principles and processes into its next phase of growth.  Decentralizing the digital city  It wasn’t until my final evening of the Fest that I realized that FWB itself had raised $10 million in VC capital at a $100M valuation from some of the biggest names in U.S. venture capital, including Andreessen Horowitz and a16Z.  According to some community members, the raise was controversial for the community (although that was not reflected in the outcome of the vote, which passed at 98%). Some see it as the financialization of creativity.  “All this emphasis on ownership and value. And I feel like I’m contributing to it by being here!” stated one LARPer at FWB Fest, who runs an art gallery IRL. “Right now, it’s still a [frigging] pyramid.”  Crypto communities are learning that the age-old human coordination challenge of governance is hard. It is difficult to operate counter to the culture you come from without perpetuating it. This has a direct effect on decentralized governance and community participation, if Web2 governance strategies are being perpetuated instead of new ones that facilitate the values of Web3.  Participation in FWB DAO governance is limited, at best. Proposals are gated by team members who help edit, shape and craft the language according to a template before it can be posted to Snapshot by the Proposal Review Committee. Members can vote on proposals, with topics including “FWB x Hennessy Partnership,” grant selections and liquidity management. According to core team members in their public talks, votes typically pass with 99% in favor every time, which is not necessarily a good signal of genuine, political engagement and healthy democracy.  This DAO community, like many others, hasn’t yet figured out decentralized governance. For its next phase of growth and mission to empower its constituency and multiply its influence, it has to.  So far, the community has remained successfully intact, or “unforked.” Yet, progressive decentralization through the localization of events is not the same as decentralized governance. The goal of FWB should be to accomplish both. The goal of any DAO should not be to exit a start-up or provide a return on investment to venture capital firms. Similarly, FWB needs to support their mission in subversive ways instead of relying on traditional funding models to pursue their mission.  The goal of this social DAO to allow people to gain agency through the creation of new economies and propagate cultural influence must carry through each localization, and somehow align back with the overarching DAO – to create not just culture but to support the principle of decentralization in line with the mission of creatives directly benefiting from their work.  Final thoughts  Surprisingly, the highlight of the weekend for me was not James Blake playing an acoustic piano set in the middle of a forest. It was the serendipity of conversations with newfound friends.  As I sat on the grassy knoll of the amphitheater under the canopy of mushroom cloud tarps to watch James Blake play a live piano set, my neighbor professed to me: “Personally, I’m going to become a member. I want to build here because it’s cool.” At that moment, we shared mutual acknowledgment of the cultural significance of the moment we were experiencing. In search of an alternative to her experience of the daily grind of working for an ad agency, she had bought into the broader Web3 vision of doing things differently, of which we are all a part.  What remains to be seen is how this creative community can collectively facilitate authentic decentralized organizing for the impassioned believers, through connections, tools, funding, and creative ingenuity. In the meantime, I will probably join, too.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Kelsie Nabben,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/17/inside-a-social-dao-how-an-online-community-becomes-a-digital-city,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fbc6b950bad4397ab26d55d616511d8621580107-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394502,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw96Tf,1666024945,"Fiat-Backed Stablecoins: What You Need to Know About Tether, USD Coin and Others","Recent turmoil in the banking industry after both Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Silvergate collapsed also caused several stablecoins to depeg, or lose their tie, to the U.S. dollar. USD Coin (USDC), particularly, was affected after its issuer, Circle, revealed that over $3 billion in its reserves was held at SVB. Over the weekend, the value of USDC dropped as low as 87 cents. As of this update, USDC has regained its peg to the dollar but the events have brought renewed focus – and questions – about this category of cryptocurrency.  A stablecoin is a term used to describe a category of cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar, to maintain a steady value in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. In other words, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar is designed to maintain a price of $1.  There are a few different types of stablecoins, including algorithmic stablecoins, cryptocurrency-backed stablecoins and fiat-backed stablecoins. A fiat-backed stablecoin simply means a government-issued currency like the U.S. dollar backs the stablecoin itself. In this article, we’ll focus on fiat-backed stablecoins and how they are meant to work, as well as why they sometimes don't.  Read more: Algorithmic Stablecoins: What They Are and How They Can Go Terribly Wrong  What are stablecoins?  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to the value of a fiat currency. They provide a way to store value within the cryptocurrency market without worrying about the fluctuations of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC). One use case for stablecoins is the ease of liquidating more volatile crypto assets into a more stable cryptocurrency to sidestep a correction or crypto crash. Instead of converting those cryptocurrencies to fiat currency, you can liquidate your digital assets into stablecoins and keep it easily accessible to re-buy into the same or other cryptocurrencies when you feel the time is right.  Read More: What Is the Point of Stablecoins? Understanding Why They Exist  What are fiat-backed stablecoins?  Stablecoins are generally categorized into four different types: fiat-backed, commodity-backed, cryptocurrency-backed and algorithmic stablecoins.  The most popular types of stablecoins are ""fiat-backed"" meaning they are digital assets that have financial reserves in fiat currency held by a regulated institution like a traditional bank. In short, compared to its three other counterparts, fiat-backed stablecoins are truly backed by real-world currencies. These coins can be used to purchase goods and services online, just like any other cryptocurrency.  Unlike other cryptocurrencies, a stablecoin's value is tied to the price of the underlying asset, and not supply and demand. For example, 1 tether (USDT) should always be worth $1, though market conditions can make it fluctuate (we'll get more into this below). This makes them a more reliable form of currency for payments than other forms of cryptocurrency.  To purchase fiat-backed stablecoins, investors need to exchange their fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies for them. When they want to sell their coins, they can exchange them for the corresponding fiat currency or use them to purchase other cryptocurrencies. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, fiat-backed coins do not require miners and are not decentralized. Instead, they use centralized servers and rely on third parties to manage their transactions.  Why causes stablecoins to depeg?  While the entire point of stablecoins is to maintain a stable value, sometimes they deviate from their peg, usually by tiny fractions of a cent. This is usually due to market conditions around liquidity and supply and demand that generally rectify quickly without intervention from the issuing companies.  In the case of USD Coin and Circle, the news that $3.3 billion of the company's reserves was held by a now-defunct bank caused worry among holders of the coin. Circle's guarantee that it held reserves equal to the amount of USDC in circulation was put in doubt, and people began to unload the stablecoin at a discount to leave their positions, fearing the worst and a UST-like meltdown.  The other contributing factor was that while USDC can be used 24/7 on chain, ""issuance and redemption is constrained by the working hours of the U.S. banking system,"" as Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire explained in a post following the depeg. Since this event, Alliare has stated they are remedying this issue with a new partner to allow automatic minting.  Finally, following U.S. regulators' guarantee that all funds would be insured, USDC began its climb back to its $1 peg, which it has regained as of this update.  For a case of a stablecoin that did not fare as well after depegging, read CoinDesk's explainer on the rise and fall of Terra.  Popular fiat-backed stablecoins  Tether  Tether (USDT) has the largest market capitalization among fiat-backed stablecoins, meaning it is the most liquid. Additionally, it is used on almost all crypto exchanges worldwide.  According to Tether, USDT is backed by assets in its reserve. It also publishes a quarterly attestation showing the percentages of its reserve by asset class.  Read more: What Is Tether? How USDT Works and What Backs Its Value  USD Coin  USD coin (USDC) is a fiat-backed stablecoin launched by the Centre Consortium. It is another popular fiat-backed stablecoin and is used on many exchanges.  Regarding fiat-backed assets, USDC reserves are kept in the custody of leading U.S. financial institutions. USDC provides transparency allowing financial institutions to maintain their fiat reserves. Additionally, USDC's partners must report their U.S. dollar holdings regularly.  See Also: USDC Stablecoin Regains Dollar Peg After Silicon Valley Bank-Induced Chaos  Binance USD  Binance USD (BUSD) is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar developed in partnership between Binance and Paxos. It adheres to the regulatory framework of the New York state Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and is backed by reserves held either in fiat cash and/or U.S. Treasury bills. Paxos issued BUSD on the Ethereum blockchain until February 2022, following regulatory action from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) which ordered a halt to any new minting of BUSD by Paxos. Binance continues to offer a wrapped BUSD token (BEP-20) on BNB Chain.

42434985,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGnddl,1666022444,Coinbase Threatens to Sue Crypto Traders Who Profited From Pricing Glitch,"Coinbase, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency trading platform by volume, is hinting it may sue about 1,000 users in the republic of Georgia for taking advantage of a pricing glitch.  On Aug. 29, about 1,000 Coinbase users in the country straddling Europe and Asia exploited the “arbitrage opportunity” when the lari, the local currency, was priced at $290 rather than $2.90 for about six hours on Coinbase. The group constitutes only 0.001% of the U.S.-based company’s users.  The glitch was a fault of a “third party,” Coinbase told CoinDesk then, without identifying the company. As such, the incident illustrates a longstanding concern of financial regulators: The risks posed to institutions by external partnerships.  ""When everything is done within a bank, we know exactly who is accountable when things break,"" said U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu last week. When work is split between an institution and fintech startups with different business models, however, “that's when risk can get lost.""  The amount of money Coinbase lost on the Georgia snafu, which the company refused to disclose, was, according to a spokesperson, “immaterial.”  Nevertheless, “Coinbase is working with law firm Gvinadze & Partners to assist in retrieving the improperly credited funds,” a Coinbase spokesperson told CoinDesk in a written statement.  “We cannot comment on the status of specific demands or litigation,” the company representative said. “However, users that return the improperly credited funds will not be subject to further legal proceedings.”  Run on ATMs  Avtandil Kutchava, host of the Georgian television show “Crypto Bazari,” told CoinDesk that about 470 people reached out to his team about the situation. Altogether, people could have made tens of millions of dollars on trades with the erroneous lari rate, Kutchava estimated, and that day ATMs in Tbilisi, Georgia’s capital, ran out of banknotes as traders rushed to cash out their jaw-dropping profits.  For example, one bitcoin was trading for 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 lari, or around $1.7 million apiece, while the average price in late August was just 55,000 to 60,000 lari.  CoinDesk talked to four traders who took advantage of that pricing glitch on a group video call. All of them said they had their bank accounts briefly frozen hours after they sold crypto for lari and withdrew fiat to their bank accounts. Several days later, the accounts and bank cards were unfrozen without any action from them.  However, on Sept. 24, all four received emails from Gvinadze & Partners saying that “Coinbase is determined to use any and all available legal means to recover improperly credited funds as soon as practical” and warning that if the users fail to respond to the email and return the money, legal action could be taken against them.  Marked ‘suspicious’  Coinbase did not confirm whether the exchange reached out to the Georgian banks asking to freeze traders’ accounts. At least two of Georgia’s major banks, Bank of Georgia and TBC, froze the accounts of the users who took advantage of the glitch but then unfroze them, the traders said.  One of the users who talked to CoinDesk, a manager at a Georgian tech startup and amateur trader named Tornike (he asked to withhold his surname), sold some Stellar lumens (XLM) on Aug. 29 while on vacation in Grigoleti, a small resort on the Black Sea shore.  He immediately withdrew his profits into his Bank of Georgia account and hit a nearby ATM to double-check: the money was available for him to withdraw. But several hours later, Tornike said, he tried buying some wine in a local store and his payment wouldn’t go through – his debit card was frozen. After three days, something changed and Tornike was able to use his bank accounts again.  Blockworks, a news site, cited a text message received by one of the traders from their bank. “Hello, we have marked your transactions with Coinbase as suspicious and we’re locking all your accounts and cards,” one bank’s blanket text message to customers reads. “Please be aware that Coinbase may request clawback of the funds. Sorry.”  Neither of the two banks responded to CoinDesk’s request for comments by press time. Gvinadze & Partners also did not respond.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/17/coinbase-threatens-to-sue-crypto-traders-who-profited-from-pricing-glitch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc9e0c93e44e044a7d296afe0d8abbc316864ada-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

TSSB Director of Enforcement Joseph Rotunda made the allegation in a filing to the bankruptcy court overseeing the potential sale of Voyager Digital's assets to the FTX crypto exchange, FTX US' parent. He said FTX US may be violating state law governing the registration and sale of securities products because it is currently offering a yield-bearing product to U.S. customers.  The filing was added to the court docket on Friday, and was submitted ahead of a hearing to finalize the potential sale of Voyager's assets to FTX. Barrons first reported the filing.  ""As more fully explained throughout this declaration, I am aware that FTX Trading, along with West Realm Shires Services Inc. dba FTX US ('FTX US'), may be offering unregistered securities in the form of yield-bearing accounts to residents of the United States. These products appear similar to the yield-bearing depository accounts offered by Voyager Digital LTD et al., and the Enforcement Division is now investigating FTX Trading, FTX US, and their principals, including Sam Bankman-Fried,"" Rotunda wrote.  He went on to explain that he downloaded the FTX app to his phone, created an account and transferred money through a bank transaction and an Ethereum transaction to that new account. Moreover, the app said he was eligible for a yield-bearing account, despite the company's terms and conditions saying FTX will not provide services to U.S. residents.  FTX yield accounts can earn up to 8% APY on the first $10,000 submitted.  ""Despite the fact I identified myself by name and address, the FTX Trading App now shows that I am earning yield on the ETH. The yield is valued at 8% APR,"" he wrote.  This ""appears to be an investment contract,"" which in turn would be regulated as a security in Texas, he wrote. FTX US has not registered its yield program within the state.  In a statement, an FTX spokesperson said the company had already been ""in talks"" with the TSSB.  ""We have an active application for a license which has been pending, and believe we are operating fully within the bounds of what we can do in the interim. We look forward to continue working with Texas. In parallel, we are working exceptionally hard to ensure Voyager customers get to the best possible outcome – which we believe will happen if our bid to give assets back to users is approved by the Voyager bankruptcy court. We remain hopeful that all state regulators are working towards this same goal of getting assets back to users,"" the spokesperson said.  Tracy Wang contributed reporting.

Related Reading: TOP 5 Cryptos To Watch This Week - BNB, BTC, ETH, QNT, LEO Quant (QNT) was trading at half its price exactly one month ago. Today, QNT broke through the $200 mark for the first time since November last year and is currently writing its fifth weekly green candle, according to TradingView. At the time of writing, Quant is trading at $216. Apparently, the QNT is currently carried by an extremely large hype, which is reflected in the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is close to a value of 75. An RSI of over 70 indicates an overheated market, as the price has risen too high too quickly. Thus, according to trading theory, a cool-down in the form of a retest of the last high at $133 for QNT could be possible. Reasons For The Skyrocketing Price Of Quant One of the drivers for the hype seems to be the news of the last weeks. In particular, the global trend and call for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) has garnered Quant extremely positive headlines.

42416063,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuY4gB,1666016351,France to Explore Crypto Tax Treatment Next Year,"France will review its crypto tax rules next year as it seeks to become the world’s leading blockchain hub – and won’t seek to simply replicate existing norms for stocks, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told local media in an interview published Monday.  Le Maire told BFM TV he was concerned about crypto’s energy consumption, and about the potential of blockchain technology to usurp the role of France’s fiat currency, the euro.  “We want to make the European Union the world’s leading economic zone for structuring and organizing the crypto market,” said Le Maire. “We want France to be the European hub of the crypto asset ecosystem.”  The EU has just agreed to its landmark Markets in Crypto Assets law (MiCA), which allows crypto companies to operate across the bloc if they meet investor-protection and stability norms.  In recent months, a string of companies such as Binance and crypto.com have registered with the French authorities under legislation which anticipates some of MiCA’s aims, but French lawmakers have protested the government is not doing enough to encourage Web3 entrepreneurs.  Read more: EU Seals Text of Landmark Crypto Law MiCA, Fund Transfer Rules  “We want to use the year 2023 to deepen our reflection with stakeholders in order to identify if new adaptations to tax legislation are necessary,” Le Maire said. “A straightforward alignment with the taxation of stocks is not necessarily a desirable goal.”  In other parts of Europe such as Germany, favorable tax policies have proved crucial to attracting crypto entrepreneurs – even if others such as Portugal, have lately had a change of heart and sought to put rates back up.  Le Maire also said he was working on a report on the environmental impact of crypto, and commended the Ethereum blockchain for its transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that uses much less energy.  But he’s not willing to see major currencies like bitcoin (BTC) take over government’s currency dominance, nor will he let people pay taxes using crypto as has been put forward in Colorado.  “The idolatry of a world without the state, without the central bank, without borders and without money … would put our sovereignty in danger, but also above all the most vulnerable among us,” he said. “Our currency is the euro and having just one currency to pay taxes is a condition of our unity.”  Read more: Trading Platform Crypto.com Secures Regulatory Approval to Operate in France  Quotations have been translated from French.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/17/france-to-explore-crypto-tax-treatment-next-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d85100ac4112af869e7679088c8fcc33e49a2ab-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The capital will be used to help hire more employees and bring new brands onboard, YoloYolo co-founder and CEO Jason Hu told CoinDesk in an interview.  Other participants in the funding round were Avalanche Ventures, UOB Venture, Signum Capital, Genblock Capital, Yolo Investments. Individual investors included Neil Cunha-Gomes of SoftBank's Vision Fund, Nicole Zhang, a former partner at crypto exchange Binance and Mike Dudas, founder and former CEO of The Block.  NFTs are digital assets such as images or songs that have underlying code verifying the uniqueness of the asset. Large brands have formed partnerships with well-known NFT collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks to sell merchandise despite the crypto bear market hitting NFTs particularly hard. Gucci partnered with vinyl toy brand Superplastic in January to launch 10 NFTs that each came with a handmade ceramic sculpture, and jewelry retailer Tiffany unveiled a $50,000 CryptoPunk necklace in July.  “One of the biggest problems in the NFT space, that’s also an opportunity for us, is there’s not enough utility,” Hu said. “People spend a lot of money on their Ape NFTs, and especially during this winter, prices drop a lot. We’re just trying to help them generate some revenue from all of the merchandise.”  The YoloYolo app, which is expected to launch in March, will connect top NFT intellectual-property holders to brands and creators in the fashion and lifestyle industries.

The cabinet, which is Japan's executive body, made the decision to move forward with the changes to the country's Foreign Exchange Act and the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds on Friday, Bittimes reported over the weekend.  The cabinet decision follows a Nikkei report from September that said the government was planning to revise the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds targeting remittances in an effort to stop criminals from using crypto exchanges to launder money.  Japan has been looking to implement anti-money-laundering standards recommended by the Financial Action Task Force, a global watchdog, since last year, while local crypto exchanges have been fighting to limit the rules' scope, citing compliance burdens and costs.  The new amendments order crypto exchanges to share information like customers' names and addresses when transfers are made between platforms, and could introduce penalties for entities that violate those rules.  The revisions, which were approved by the cabinet, are now scheduled to be submitted to the National Diet, Japan's legislature, the report said.

The so-called Fed pivot in favor of easing, however, may not bring immediate relief to the crypto market.  That's the message from the S&P 500's historical data, which shows Wall Street's equity index, a benchmark for risky assets worldwide, bottoms out several months after the Fed kicks off the easing cycle with an interest rate cut.  Bitcoin tends to move more or less with the sentiment on Wall Street. The Fed has raised rates by 300 basis points this year, wreaking havoc for risk assets.  The U.S. saw six economic recessions between 1969 and 2007.  In each case, stocks extended losses, falling by an average of 28%, after the Fed cut rates to stimulate the economy, according to data tweeted by Nick Gerli, CEO and founder of Reventure Consulting.  After the Fed pivot, the average time taken to bottom out was 14 months.  ""Few are asking, 'what happens if pivot?' – perhaps a better question is: When sustainable bottom? In other words, this is not March 2020; a recessionary bear market takes longer to bottom; among other things, the economy needs to actually bottom for the market to bottom,"" Callum Thomas, head of research and founder at Topdown Charts, wrote in the latest edition of Weekly S&P 500 ChartStorm, commenting on data shared by Gerli.

42416076,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuY5FP,1665999429,Quant Network's QNT Token Enters Top 30 Crypto List With an Enviable 'Overbought' Status,"""There's always a bull market somewhere,"" ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer once famously said.  Perhaps truer words have never been spoken, as a cryptocurrency called QNT, the native token of interoperability-focused Quant Network, has come out of oblivion with a staggering 450% jump in four months, decoupling from the broader market lull.  At press time, QNT was the 28th largest cryptocurrency per market capitalization, at $3.1 billion, ahead of the better-known cryptocurrencies monero (XMR) and stellar (XLM), according to data source CoinGecko. Now with a price over $200, QNT is at its highest since December 2021.  QNT was the only top 30 coin boasting an overbought status – a signal flashed by a popular technical analysis tool called the relative strength index (RSI), indicating strong upward momentum. That's an envious achievement, considering the broader market has shown little signs of life since the May-June crash.  An RSI above 70 implies overbought conditions, while a reading under 30 suggests the asset is oversold. The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.  Founded in 2015, Quant Network uses Overledger technology – an interoperable blockchain operating system – to facilitate interaction with different public and private blockchains simultaneously. The QNT token is used to pay fees to access the technology. The token's maximum supply is capped at 14.6 million.  While QNT's daily chart RSI stood well above 70 as of writing, bitcoin's RSI was directionless below 50.00.  Retail traders often misread an overbought RSI as a sign of an impending bearish reversal. However, that's not necessarily the case. An above-70 or overbought reading indicates the asset has moved too high too quickly and there could be a temporary bull breather.  QNT's rally is backed by an increased accumulation of coins by address owning 100 QNT and 1,000 QNT, dubbed whales by blockchain analytics firm Santiment.  The number of QNT held by the whale addresses has increased from 1.47 million to nearly 1.7 million in four months.  The sentiment is quite bullish on Crypto Twitter, with some handles saying the token is still cheap.  While it's difficult to pinpoint the exact catalyst for the bullish trend, circumstantial evidence suggests that the launch of ""tokenise"" at the end of June likely galvanized investor interest in the cryptocurrency. Tokenise allows users to create and deploy interoperable QRC-20 tokens (Ethereum standard counterpart) and digital assets onto mainnets.  Further, On Aug. 22, Quant Network announced a non-fungible tokens (NFT) standard called QRC-721 to help users build and deploy secure, interoperable NFTs and overcome limitations associated with Ethereum's ERC-721. According to Martin Hargreaves, Quant's chief product officer, the ERC-721 tokens lack interoperability and have been subject to hacks.  Lastly, the belief that Quant Network, with its interoperability feature, would play a pivotal role in building central bank digital currencies may have contributed to the rally.",POSITIVE,QNT,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | QNT,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/17/quant-networks-qnt-token-enters-top-30-crypto-list-with-an-envious-overbought-status,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4a87f5c14768062c9c24e2657d421dbb81f2144-2854x1322.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The association said that the miner was producing empty blocks on Bitcoin SV. The miner, who operates by the address ""1KPSTuJMCMRXrTWHfCwpiRZg1ALbJzh844,"" changes their coinbase string with a constantly changing string, according to Bitcoin Association.  Empty blocks refer to a block produced on any blockchain network that does not keep any transactional data other than the data required to generate that transaction, and require the same computation resources as used by a normal block. Empty blocks are often criticized as “bad behavior,"" creating little value for the network by accelerating disinflation and stealing from “honest” miners.  The Bitcoin Association said that the miner is ignoring the tens of millions of broadcasted fee-paying transactions in favor of producing empty blocks, which has caused strain on the network.  Some in the BSV community said miners were within their rights to mine empty blocks and were simply doing so because an economic decision had them deem the block subsidy itself a sufficient reward. ""They wouldn’t bother with the workload of validating millions of transactions because the fees are too cheap to justify including them even in aggregate,"" wrote Todd Price, a curriculum specialist at Bitcoin Association.

ASIC said it is concerned that Holon has not appropriately considered the features and risks of the Funds in determining their target markets.  The regulator believes Holon's crypto funds are not suited to the wide target market defined in their TMDs, which includes investors ranging from potentially medium, high or very high risk and return profile.  The suspension applies to Holon's bitcoin, ether, and filecoin funds. All three funds are managed by the crypto exchange Gemini.  ""If the ASIC's concerns are not addressed in a timely manner, final stop orders will be placed on the funds,"" the press release said.

The exploiter gained access to the platform's treasury wallet and transferred 197 NFTs to a wallet with the address ""0x5f7848EC0286304DC5FE6497AF4B3C0FeaD6A920"" and then started selling the NFTs at prices much lower than their previously listed values, breaking the floor price of the collection.  The price of the collection fell from 1 ether (ETH), or around $1,300, to 0.1 ether or $130. LiveArtX said that the stolen NFTs have been frozen and that it was working on identifying the attacker. The company also said in its Discord channel that it would reimburse buyers of the stolen NFTs.  LiveArtX said the exploit apparently occurred after an individual gained access to the private key of the Seven Treasures collections, after which they could sell all the NFTs. A private key is a secret number used in blockchain technology, similar to a password, that allows its holders to access, transfer and change information about the data or tokens of that private key.  Team members said the smart contract was updated following the incident, meaning the compromised private key is no longer valid and users will not be able to purchase or sell the currently-listed NFTs on OpenSea.  In a message on Discord, LiveArtX said it failed to put relevant measures in place to avoid the attack. ""We did not separate the operation wallet from the Treasury wallet. We failed to implement a multi-sig mechanism for the Treasury wallet. The private key was passed on to more than one team member,"" team members said in the message.  Earlier this year, the platform had raised $4.5 million from notable crypto investors like Animoca Brands, BNB Chain Fund and KuCoin, Alameda Ventures. NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items.  The crypto world has been bombarded by a slew of exploits and hacks, the most recent being the decentralized exchange Mango, which drained $117 million worth of crypto. The exploiter later came out and defended the attack and returned $67 million. According to blockchain sleuth Chainalysis, October is already the worst month for crypto hacks so far.

The price is trading below $19,400 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $19,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could move down further to test the $18,900 support zone in the near term. Bitcoin Price Trims Gains Bitcoin price attempted a decent increase above the $19,500 resistance zone. BTC even climbed above the $19,800 level, but the bears were active near the $20,000 resistance zone. The price traded as high as $19,939 before there was a fresh decline. There was a drop below the $19,500 and $19,400 levels. The bears even pushed the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $18,271 swing low to $19,939 high. Bitcoin price is now trading below $19,400 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.

Cryptos Remain in a Holding Pattern  By James Rubin  Bitcoin continued its recent residency above $19,000 in another quiet trading weekend as investors weighed the same two issues that have been dominating their thoughts for months: inflation and recession.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading at about $19,250, slightly up over the previous 24 hours and from where it stood at the start of the weekend. BTC has traded listlessly within a narrow $19,000 to $21,000 range it's held for much of the past month. Analysts see the trend continuing short of an unexpected catalyst in the weeks ahead.  An expected 75 basis point interest rate increase at next month's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and continued U.S. Federal Reserve hawkishness through the end of the year seems already entrenched in investors' thinking as the U.S. central bank looks to staunch doggedly high inflation. The Federal Reserve is aiming to reduce inflation to 2% from its current 8.2% reading.  ""Bitcoin is holding up nicely,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email. ""Risk aversion is running wild and bitcoin is not breaking. Fed rate hike expectations are rising and bitcoin is still holding onto the $19,000 level.""  Ether was recently changing hands just above $1,300, up more than 2% from a day earlier. The second-largest crypto by market value has been tangoing with this level since mid September shortly after the Merge, the technological overhaul to shift the Ethereum blockchain into a more energy efficient proof-of-stake protocol. Other major cryptos were recently trading mostly higher, with AAVE and ALPACA both up about 5%. XRP was off approximately 1.5%.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, was up 1.35%. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index recently returned to extreme fear territory.  Stocks  After spiking unexpectedly following Thursday's disappointing Consumer Price Index report, equity markets returned to the downtrodden ways they've followed for much of the year with the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing Friday down 2.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both off more than a percentage point. The gyrations of the past two trading days reflected ongoing worries that have made investors risk averse.  ""The Fed wants further concrete evidence that inflation is trending toward its 2% objective and that hasn't come to fruition partly because the bulk of our inflation problems are attributable to supply stocks, and monetary policy can't address that source of inflation,"" research group Moody's Analytics wrote in a weekly report.  U.S. real estate and China productivity will occupy in the spotlight among this week's major economic indicators. The National Association of Home Builders will release its monthly Housing Market Index on Monday. The index, a measure of builder sentiment, has fallen nine consecutive months, a reflection of the softening U.S. real estate market. China will announce third-quarter gross domestic product and September manufacturing, both year over year.  And the third-quarter earnings season will continue after a week of mixed results from financial services giants, including JPMorgan Chase (good) and Citigroup and Morgan Stanley (not so good).  Crypto news  On Saturday, Avraham Eisenberg admitted that he was part of a group that drained $114 million from decentralized crypto exchange Mango Markets last week, and returned $67 million to the Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) hub, even as he defended his actions — which some have called an exploit — as both legal and highly lucrative. The exploit is one of several to plague platforms in recent weeks. Earlier this month month, BNB Chain, a blockchain closely connected with crypto exchange Binance, was the victim in a hack that ultimately drained the ecosystem of $100 million in crypto.  Oanda's Moya noted optimistically that bitcoin’s current ""stabilization period is good news for long-term bulls.""  ""The high-frequency trading systems and hedge funds have their preferred shorts and right now it seems Bitcoin is becoming a long-term bet for many,"" Moya wrote. ""If U.S. stocks tumble below the 3,600 level this earnings season, and Bitcoin does not break below the summer lows, the crypto winter can officially be called over.""

Good Luck Getting Rivals to Cooperate  By Sam Reynolds  Asia’s economies can be both the best of friends, and the worst enemies. Are they really going to be charmed by a proposed pan-Asia central bank digital currency to erode dollar hegemony backed by China?  Chinese state researchers say such an initiative would bolster monetary cooperation between the regions’ economies, lessening their dependence on the U.S. dollar. But such an effort would present formidable obstacles.  While the world’s modern industrial supply chain crisscrosses the Asian continent, the same companies that, say, provide Apple parts for its iPhone also compete to replace each other for parts for next year’s model. Samsung provides the display for the iPhone, yet its foundry division competes with Taiwan Semiconductor to fabricate Apple’s latest chips for the phone.  Technological rivalry  There’s a deep technological rivalry between nations in Asia. Japan is the region’s oldest industrialized economy and a target for South Korea’s chaebols. Although the origin of the likes of Sony and Panasonic differ from Samsung and LG, ultimately South Korea’s consumer electronics industry bested its Japanese rival, and Trinitron TV’s are no longer a mainstay in every home.  Part of that is technological – Samsung and LG didn’t invent the LCD display but were better at innovation – but part of it involves economics and exchange rates. In the mid-2000s, South Korea, an emerging market, had a much lower cost of labor. But from the late 1990s, Japan’s consumer electronics companies sounded the alarm on the strong yen’s impact on their bottom line.  Although Sony’s PlayStation 2 was a must-have for any gamer in 2000, its immense development cost, a sky-high yen, and slowing sales of televisions made the year disappointing for the company’s balance sheet and stock. In May 2000, ComputerWorld reported that had it not been for the strong yen, operating income would have been 39% higher.  That story was the same for most of the decade, with staggering losses every year, and by 2012 obituaries were being written for Sony’s consumer electronics business and Japan’s manufacturers as a whole. Despite the pain it was causing for Japan’s exporters, the yen stayed strong because of the world’s macroeconomic condition at the time.  For a while, manufacturing Toyota vehicles in Kentucky to export to Korea was more viable because of the strength of the yen, as the Financial Times reported. in 2011. Meanwhile, as the decade wore on, high-end LG’s 4K and 8K Korean TVs started to steal market share from Sony and Panasonic in Japan (despite a strong consumer preference for homegrown brands) because of LGs’ competitive price. This trend occurred, although Sony invented the OLED technology they use.  So with that in mind, what interest would Seoul have in adopting a pan-Asia digital currency? For most of the last two decades, the relative strength of the yen compared to the won has turbocharged exports since Japan and Korea’s economies are direct competitors.  A falling yen  Now the yen is at a historic low, which will make it easier for Tokyo to boost exports. It’s also convenient for those in the hospitality industry, as Japan looks like a compelling post-COVID tourism destination now that border controls have been relaxed.  Most other central bankers in the region are aware of the need to keep their currencies competitive; perhaps too keenly aware of this. In 2017, S&P Global showed that Taiwan, South Korea and Thailand were some of the world’s largest currency manipulators (ironically, Taiwan is the larger currency manipulator than China). Having one, unified, Euro-like currency for the region isn’t going to be a popular move.  Keeping the status quo is desirable  And none of these countries want to disrupt U.S. dollar hegemony, for the same reason. In markets like Taiwan and South Korea there are no foreign holdings of their respective currencies (which gives them the ultimate control over their exchange rates). Exports and imports are largely denominated in U.S. dollars, with both nations claiming that there are no capital controls as foreign currency flows freely.  These countries are such fans of the hegemony of the dollar that many have increased their holdings of U.S. treasury bills during the last two quarters. But that’s been the trend worldwide during the last decade as foreign and international investors held $5.3 trillion in U.S. debt during the second quarter of 2012 and now hold $7.4 trillion in Q2 2022 according to FRED.  Sure, there’s been the quarter-on-quarter slowdown and the occasional trimming of holdings, but they certainly aren’t selling to buy China’s digital yuan.
