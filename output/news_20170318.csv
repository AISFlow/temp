42379311,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87SDr,1489845015,"After ETF Rejection, What's Next for Bitcoin On Wall Street?","Days after the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) was roundly rejected by regulators, this much is certain: digital currency investors remain in waiting for the asset's proper Wall Street debut.  But, how long exactly might this be? And will bitcoin ever see mainstream market acceptance? Those are just some of the lingering questions that the tech's avid supporters, and industry analysts, are now left with.  However, a consensus on sentiment is starting to emerge.  In the aftermath of the SEC's decision, many in the industry are asserting that the rejection was more than just an indictment of the particular proposal. Rather, they argue it was a clear message that further maturation of bitcoin markets is needed before such a product can be offered to retail investors.  Blake Estes, an attorney with Alston & Bird, argued that those seeking to launch similar financial projects aimed at retail investors will likely be destined for the same fate as the Winklevoss proposal.  He said:  ""It is clear that the SEC believes that the bitcoin markets do not currently have the structural protections and controls necessary to support an ETF product.""  Estes focused on the SEC's emphasis on ""fundamental deficiencies"" in the bitcoin markets, arguing any proposed investment vehicle will likely see a drawn-out approval process and rejection.  ""I don’t see what would change in the underlying bitcoin markets so significantly in the next six to 12 months that would allow the SEC to get comfortable,"" he said.  Strong critiques  As the SEC's mandate is to ensure that investors are protected, observers emphasize that more work must now be put into building investor and consumer protections in the bitcoin ecosystem.  Mark T Williams, a professor at Boston University’s business school and former bank examiner at the Federal Reserve, used the rejection to highlight his long-held criticisms of the market surrounding cryptocurrencies generally.  ""This detailed SEC ruling makes it clear that more focus has to be placed on needed protections to stabilize and add basic controls over the bitcoin infrastructure before it will be investor-safe and ready for public consumption,"" he said.  He went on to add that a premature approval of an investment vehicle without such protections would likely undermine the long-term prospects of such currencies and innovations in blockchain technology.  Williams said:  ""I was a little surprised that so many market pundits assumed that the SEC would simply approve this bitcoin ETF and ignore concerns about price discovery, lack of regulation, operational standards and controls that increase price manipulation, fraud and cyber risk.”  Estes agreed, arguing that the reasons for disapproval were due to deficiencies in underlying markets – and the fear of worst-case scenarios.  ""The SEC’s nightmare scenario is they approve this, all this retirement money floods in and then there’s another enormous headline-grabbing hack where millions of bitcoins are stolen or something happens in one of the Chinese markets,"" he said.  Going solo  Still, given the swift rebound in bitcoin’s price following Friday’s announcement, another question being weighed is how much Wall Street approval ultimately matters to bitcoin’s legitimacy.  ""I think bitcoin [will never get] accepted by financial regulators in any major way, and the reason why is that it's fundamentally against sovereignty,"" said Josh Crumb, co-founder of GoldMoney and a former commodities strategist at Goldman Sachs.  Crumb added:  ""Bitcoin’s utility is that it cuts through sovereignty. It’s its own law.""  Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, voiced a similar sentiment, stating his belief that cryptocurrencies don't need SEC approval to gain legitimacy.  ""Although bitcoin was volatile around the time of the announcement, the bounce back in price shows increasing confidence in the asset,"" he said.  Nonetheless, observers reckon that successful operation of these vehicles could potentially be a bridge toward bitcoin being packaged more broadly for the public.

42379317,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87SHd,1489830303,The Ultimate List of ICO Resources,"William Mougayar is the author of ""The Business Blockchain"" and a board advisor to, and investor in, various blockchain projects and startups (see: disclosures). On 25th May, 2017, he is organizing the Token Summit in New York, a one-day event discussing in-depth the token economy.  In this opinion piece, Mougayar lists his ultimate 18 web resources for those wanting to research, track or launch initial coin offerings or ICOs.  Despite some regulatory uncertainties and cautiousness, the ICO space is developing at a rapid pace. ICOs are just one application of the token-based models that blockchains enable.  How do you keep track of the various ICOs that are being planned and launched?  A flurry of websites and businesses are emerging to track, analyze, manage, and offer services to help market, plan, develop or launch ICOs.  I recently went on a hunt to gather the various resources that list them. The result offers an eye-opening expedition into this burgeoning phenomenon.  Here’s my ultimate list of websites with ICO resources (in alphabetical order).  ICO Timeline    Partial list of ICO projects.  13. ICO Tracker  Lists ICO crowdsales according to five factors: white paper, roadmap. team, escrow, ICO conditions.  14. Newbium  Provides crypto news and information.  15. PrivateMarket  PrivateMarket Technologies enable wealth managers to access, analyse and execute primary and secondary market transactions online.  16. TokenMarket  TokenMarket is a marketplace for tokens, digital assets and blockchain based investing. Users can research and invest in tokenized assets, or launch a crowdsale for a project.  17. Reddit's ICO Crypto forum  Hosts discussions of active and upcoming ICO/crowdsales, and is building a due diligence community.  18. Smith + Crown  Maintains a curated list of ongoing and upcoming cryptocurrency ICOs, token sales, and crowdsales. Projects are evaluated for listing using multiple criteria, but in general, they list ICOs that should raise the equivalent of $30,000 or are unique in some way. Provides summaries and commentary for select ICOs. Listing or research is not considered an endorsement.  Update: Additional resources include Token Investor, Github's Ultimate ICO Calendar, ICO Bazaar and Week in Ethereum.  Have I missed others that should be included?

42379322,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87SNv,1489806697,"Bitcoin Sinks $100 As Price Nears $1,000","Bitcoin prices fell to their lowest level in a week today, dropping to a low of $1,057 at press time.  In total, the price of bitcoin has fallen $100 since 15:00 UTC yesterday, declining steadily to its lowest point since 10th March, data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index reveals.  The news comes amid continued discussion about a bitcoin hard fork that, if executed, could result in bitcoin splitting into two separate networks with two distinct 'bitcoin' assets. Today's dialogue was propelled by major exchanges, nearly 20 of which indicated they are taking steps to prepare and safeguard user funds in the event of such a scenario.  Despite the decline, however, bitcoin's price is currently in its longest period above $1,000, stability that has come even amid negative news, including continued uncertainty regarding China's regulatory situation and the rejection of a bitcoin investment vehicle last week.  Bitcoin's decline also comes amid a string of gains by alternative blockchain-based assets, with ethereum's token, ether, and dash hitting all-time highs in recent trading sessions.

42379314,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87SF7,1489803209,Which Majority? Bitcoin Exchange Accord Reveals Hard Fork Dilemma,"A newly released statement from major exchanges today may have stoked tensions in the ongoing bitcoin scaling debate – but it also revealed more about how the confrontation is becoming increasingly complex.  Today, nearly 20 exchanges announced that, should a certain developer group take actions that would split the bitcoin blockchain into two competing networks, the network running software developed by Bitcoin Core would retain the ticker symbol ‘BTC’. Bitcoin Unlimited, the alternative option, would then be advertised as ‘BTU’.  Ostensively aimed at preventing customer confusion, the move has already been highly politicized, with some supporters of the Bitcoin Core development team heralding it as the effective end of the Unlimited project and its particular proposal for redrafting bitcoin’s rules.  ""Mining pools may signal Bitcoin Unlimited, but this letter makes it crystal clear that the economy won't accept it – the best outcome they can hope for is to have their BTU token listed,"" former BTCC COO Samson Mow alleged in a statement.  However, to exchange officials, the move is designed not to provoke, but to be forward-thinking in how it safeguards user funds. (A key component of the messaging is that to list the alternative, the exchanges would require a guarantee that users would be protected from attacks).  Further, major exchange representatives are saying that the statement does not mean that they intend to act as decision-makers. Rather, it's that they’re open to having the market naturally settle the issue.  Kraken CEO Jesse Powell told CoinDesk:  ""There should be no implication taken that anyone is committed to leaving the BTC tickers with core. At least some would assign that ticker to the longest chain.""  As noted by Powell, there remains an open argument over how to decide which of the two resulting blockchains would be the true “bitcoin”, and the role that exchanges would play in what could be a long decision-making.  Miners and the economy  To observers, the debate has now evolved into one in which two communities, miners and the so-called 'bitcoin economy' (exchanges, wallets and developers), could square off to determine the future of the network.  Yet that reality shows that while ethereum and ethereum classic, the most high-profile fork to date, was a divergence of two groups that wanted to go separate ways, bitcoin’s hard fork is predicated on one widely held agreement – that participants only want one bitcoin asset.  “It’s my opinion that those two will eventually be the same,” Michael Perklin, chief information security officer at ShapeShift, one of the announcement's signatories, told CoinDesk.  He added:  ""Miners will hash the chain that has the economic majority. Users will choose the blockchain that has the most proof of work. Eventually one will win over the other.""  Blockstream CEO Adam Back cited historical precedent for this idea, noting that during bitcoin's first halving (in which its rewards declined from 50 BTC to 25 BTC), some miners continued to try to elicit the former level of rewards.  ""Unfortunately for them the economic nodes on the network automatically rejected and hid their blocks, so they stopped and rejoined the network,"" he said.  This time, the fear is that given the ideological lines involved, the process could be prolonged.  Exchange representatives acknowledged that a fork could be a complex process from an operations standpoint, one in which charting and historical data would be disrupted, and costly upgrades would need to be made.  Economy first  But today’s events also mark a major challenge to the idea that miners have a natural role as decision-makers on the bitcoin blockchain, one that was original encouraged by some developers.  Digging further into this idea, a notable contingent of developers believe that bitcoin’s software was designed with a smaller role for miners in mind. After all, bitcoin’s white paper envisioned that mining would take place on desktop computers, not complex data centers.  This view is perhaps best summarized by support for the so-called UASF, a recent proposal by which the 'economic majority' would drive miners to support opt-in code changes.  If the exchanges, payment processors and nodes that participate in the bitcoin economy commit to supporting a certain version of the software, then miners will have to go along, otherwise they won’t be paid – or so the view goes.  ""The economic power is much greater than the mining power, and if you have the economic actors pushing a certain action, the miners are working for the economy,"" Lopp said.  Mow pointed to a list of companies that support one code change in question, SegWit, as evidence that miners are not supporting what users want.  Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr went on to describe the roles of the economy and the miners as not pitted against one another, but presented the current debate as a refinement of this understanding.  Miners simply have a specific role to uphold, he contends.  ""It's not so much that one follows the other, but that miners are obliged to do what the economic majority decides.’ he said, concluding:  “And if they don't, they cease to be miners.”  Boxing ring via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/03/18/which-majority-bitcoin-exchange-accord-reveals-hard-fork-dilemma,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a84fdc48521daf67540122ade54b5f1c5bf2cf88-1500x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
