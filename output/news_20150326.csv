42398293,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT7D4,1427404716,Why a New SEC Ruling Could Be 'Revolutionary' for Bitcoin Crowdfunding,"Jared Marx is an attorney at Washington, DC law firm Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis. He advises companies about bitcoin-related regulatory law and represents companies and individuals in civil and criminal proceedings.  Here, he discusses why a new securities ruling is a potential boon for 'crypto 2.0' and 'bitcoin 2.0' companies operating in the US.  On Wednesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted regulations permitting crowdfunding for business startups.  The new rules give businesses in the blockchain ecosystem an avenue to get financial backing from the best-educated investors out there: their users.  I wrote last week about the challenges that 'bitcoin 2.0' companies face from the squishy definition of a ""security"" under US law. These new rules don’t resolve that ambiguity, but they do create a low-cost safe harbor for businesses that want to avoid uncertainty (and possible criminal exposure) by simply treating their token sales as sales of securities.  Here’s how it works: prior to these rules, a company could generally sell securities only to wealthy individuals or after going through expensive registration with the SEC.  Now, companies can file a mini-registration statement with the SEC and then sell securities to ordinary people, including over the Internet.  As an added bonus, state-level compliance under these rules is minimal, as the SEC has largely preempted state securities laws in this area. There is, of course, a whole bunch of fine print.  Businesses that choose this route, for example, will need audited financial statements, and will have to do some ongoing reporting to the SEC. There are also limits on how much capital you can raise this way, though those limits — $20m or $50m, depending on which “tier” of the rule you use — are unlikely pose problems for most companies in the space.  Similarly, companies can accept only a certain amount of money from each investor. But again, the limit is relatively high — 10% of each investor’s wealth or yearly income — and even better, companies can generally rely on investors to self-certify that they’ve met this requirement.  Other details are more mundane, but also put this firmly in the don’t-try-this-at-home category: There are rules about sales by affiliates, rules about pre-sale “solicitations of interest,” and lots of rules about what goes in the mini-registration statement. Prior “bad acts” can also disqualify a company from using the provisions, and only US and Canada based (and incorporated) issuers qualify.  These new rules are good — and potentially revolutionary — for bitcoin 2.0 companies.  But they’re also good for all companies in the bitcoin ecosystem, who can take advantage of them to raise capital from their tech-savvy pool of users. Selling securities this way still isn’t a walk in the park — it will place some additional burdens on companies and require careful legal advice. But it is decidedly good news that companies can now count this path as among their options.

42398300,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT7Kw,1427401239,Bitcoin Investment Trust Sponsor Launches Ahead of Market Debut,"Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) has received approval to list on the securities marketplace OTC Markets Group, meaning shares could begin trading as soon as next week.  In preparation for the debut, the private investment vehicle owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG) has announced the launch of Grayscale Investmentshttp://grayscale.co/, which will sponsor the BIT, taking on responsibilities as necessary to register and run the fund.  Commenting on the news, director of sales & business development Michael Sonnenshein laid out a broad vision for the latest entrant in the larger DCG entity, the parent brand for bitcoin products and services spearheaded by founder Barry Silbert.  Sonnenshein told CoinDesk:  ""We're trying to establish ourselves as the trusted authority on digital currency investing, and seek to develop a fleet of investable products that will allow people to invest in digital currency.""  Sonnenshein indicated that Grayscale's name was inspired by the appearance of a distributed network of nodes at distance.  ""As you draw back away from it, it reveals this nice grayscale, it's a mathematical look at it, and it's a name we all really loved,"" he added.  No set trading time  While certain eligible owners of BIT shares will be able to start trading as soon as next week, Sonnenshein stressed that Grayscale can't predict exactly when this process will begin.  ""What is going to be traded are existing shares and those shares are owned by people who have owned them for longer than a year. Having owned them longer than a year, that means they no longer have a restriction on them, but shareholders have to elect to sell those shares,"" Sonnenshein explained.  The process, he suggested, could take up to several business days, and may be influenced by factors such as the price of the shares when initially purchased, a time close to when bitcoin was trading near peak levels.  Still, Sonnenshein expressed his hope that original shareholders would be willing to sell to satisfy market demand, stating:  ""We have no control over how many people chose to sell and chose to buy, that is all market-driven.""  Consumer warnings  Of note on the new Grayscale website may be the lengthy terms and conditions, which include language that articulates the volatile nature of bitcoin, as well as how the fund is not registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, a tactical move that allowed it to be first-to-market with a bitcoin investment vehicle.  Addressing concerns these might alienate potential buyers, Sonnenshein stressed that this was concurrent with Grayscale's duties to disclose the risks of the fund alongside its benefits.  ""We all know that bitoin is a volatile investment. Like any investment there are those certain disclaimers that we include in our language,"" he said.  Sonnenshein emphasized the exciting nature of the launch, which he contends will provide a more familiar experience to investors who don't want to go through the friction of buying and storing bitcoin but nonetheless want exposure to the market.  Continued development  Sonnenshein also provided details about the day-to-day operations at the firm, which is based out of the larger DCG office in New York.  Grayscale, he said, is now hiring to expand its team, which he described as small but looking to grow given the new activity he expects around BIT.  BIT will continue to create restricted shares for sale to eligible investors, while those who don't meet such qualifications will be able to purchase shares through the OTCQX marketplace.  The fund is listed under the symbol GBTC.

42398294,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT7E3,1427394026,Swedish Bitcoin Firm Enters Court Battle to Protect Customer Data,"A Swedish bitcoin brokerage has gone to court with the country’s tax authority to prevent an audit of its customer information.  Goobit AB, the company that operates the Stockholm-based BTCX, is fighting a third-party audit request from the Skatteverket, the Swedish tax agency, that would require it to disclose information about its customer base.  As reported last week by Swedish language newspaper Dagens Nyheter, BTCX has gone to court in order to prevent this information from being handed over.  Goobit chief marketing officer Joakim Herlin-Ljunglöf voiced concern that Swedish authorities might use such information to track bitcoin transactions on the blockchain, explaining:  ""With the information they have requested the tax agency will see each bitcoin’s history, which includes all the previous owners and transactions, and it also gives the tax agency the opportunity to monitor transactions that will be implemented in the future, by people who may have nothing at all to do with Sweden or Swedish taxes.""  He told CoinDesk that his company is contesting the order partly on grounds that the Skatterverket lacks an understanding of bitcoin.  Open to cooperation  Herlin-Ljunglöf suggested that, given the nature of the case, the battle could move to an EU-level court, with broad implications for Europe's bitcoin users.  He added that his company wants to cooperate with Swedish tax authorities, but not at the expense of disclosing sensitive customer information.  Herlin-Ljunglöf told CoinDesk:  ""We have no wish at all to be difficult, but, the information now requested from us, concerning thousands of individual customers, is not necessary for the supervision of an individual or for the preservation of evidence against an individual ... We believe that it could be illegal to request the data.""  According to the report by Dagens Nyheter, a representative for the Skatteverket declined to comment on the third-party audit. CoinDesk reached out to the Skatteverket but did not receive an immediate response.

42411163,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gkaANL,1427386566,Could the Bitcoin Lightning Network Solve Blockchain Scalability?,"The blockchain's increasing size continues to raise concerns about its ability to accommodate transaction growth.  But, could a decentralised system where transactions are sent over a network of off-blockchain micropayment channels solve the ledger's scalability problems?  Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja, the developers behind the Bitcoin Lightning Network, think so.  Although still in its nascent stage, the Lightning Network – based on a recent white paper – aims to solve the scalability issue by implementing hashed timelock contracts between users.  The Bitcoin Lightning Network came to life in 2013, when Poon, ""like many before him"", he says, had the idea for hub and spoke payment channels. Dryja came on board soon after, making scripting and transactions more compact.  Poon told CoinDesk:     ""We hope to help solve bitcoin scalability and instant transactions, enabling bitcoin to encompass all transactions – even many thousands of micropayments per person,"" he concluded.  Initial challenges included the realisation that the solution required the implementation of a soft-fork; a change to the bitcoin protocol that serves to invalidate pervious blocks and transactions, although the old nodes still recognise the new blocks as valid.  The scalability problem  Full bitcoin nodes are required to store a record of every single transaction that takes place, and as this record grows, that in turn is decreasing the amount of people willing to pay for the escalating costs of running nodes.  For this reason, the developers believe that bitcoin's open ledger does not suffice as a lone payment platform.  To put this into perspective, according to the white paper, the Visa payment network is believed to complete 45,000 transactions per second during a standard holiday period. This increases to hundreds of millions on an average business day.  Bitcoin currently supports approximately seven transactions per second, and is limited to one megabyte of block space. To achieve more than 45,000 transactions per second, Poon and Dryja say that bitcoin transactions must be conducted off the blockchain itself.  The white paper notes:     It continues: ""It is desirable for two individuals to net out their relationship at a later date, rather than detailing every transaction on the blockchain. This can be achieved by using timelocks as a component to global consensus.""  The Bitcoin Lightning Network  While this may sound complicated, essentially it works like this – If all bitcoin transactions are being discussed in an open forum, its public ledger, the lightning network allows parties to enter into a closed room for a period of time, conduct transactions during that period, and at the end of the agreed time, broadcast these transactions to the network.  The white paper states:  ""The obligation to deliver funds to an end-recipient is achieved through a process of chained delegation. Each participant along the path assumes the obligation to deliver a particular recipient. They pass on this obligation to the next participant in the path.""  Supporters of the proposal suggest this is an improvement over the current transaction systems employed by bitcoin services companies like Coinbase, where transactions are conducted off-blockchain, or away from the network.  They argue that in such scenarios, bitcoins on the network are controlled by Coinbase to avoid the complications of settling small transactions in real-time on the network. Lightning, they argue, presents an alternative where users are in control of funds.  The Lightning Network is not the only project seeking for a sustainable solution to micropayments, however.  BlockCypher recently proposed a solution by which it plans to ""calculate miners' fees opportunistically"" to ensure microtransactions are added to the blockchain. The system is already in use by Zapchain, the bitcoin-focused social network that recently launched a dedicated micropayments channel.  Decrementing timelocks  A hash-time locked contract is first opened by creating a transaction output which only the final recipient can redeem.  The recipient will generate random data 'R', and then hash 'R' using hash(R) to produce 'H'. This information is passed on directly from the receiver to the sender of the funds, along with the recipient's bitcoin address.  The sender then routes the payment to the receiver. Once the receiver has received an updated transaction in a micropayment channel, the recipient may elect to redeem the transaction by disclosing 'R', pulling the funds form the sender.  The purpose of the hash locked contract is to require message 'R' to be disclosed in order for the transaction to be broadcast on the blockchain before a certain date.  However, if Dave does not produce 'R' for Carol within the established time limit, then Carol will be able to close the hash locked time contract.  The receiver will never disclose 'R' unless they are certain that they will receive payment from one of the channel's counterparties. If a party disconnects the channel, the counterparty will be responsible for broadcasting the current commitment transaction state on the blockchain.  Associated risks  However, Poon's and Dryja's proposal does not come without an element of associated risk.  Time is of essence. Participants have to give each other enough time to complete the transaction. If not, invalid transactions may pass off as valid, enabling coins to be stolen.  Additionally, the developers explain that it is unlikely that all participants are honest. If a malicious party creates various channels and makes them all expire at once, this would overwhelm data capacity and would mean that the transaction would have to broadcast on to the chain.  This ""mass spamming"" of the bitcoin network could potentially delay transactions to the point where other timelocked transactions are also validated.  Then there's the issue of connectivity. In this system, all parties must be online to use private keys. If someone's computer is compromised, counterparty theft may also take place.  The counterparty may also be able to steal funds if one of the participants losses data. This can be mitigated by installing a third-party data storage service where encrypted data gets sent to this third party service. Additionally, the white paper notes:  ""One should choose channel counterparties who are responsible and willing to provide the current state, with some periodic tests of honesty.""  Community reaction  The Bitcoin Lightning network is certainly a bold attempt at solving the blockchain's scalability issues. But, is it a viable one?  Peter Todd, a bitcoin core developer, believes it is, although he says that it needs to be contextualised further.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Todd, said:  ""If the bitcoin blockchain were a horse, ordinary hub-and-spoke payment channel proposals would be proposing to replace that horse with a truck; the Lightning guys are proposing to replace that horse with a rocket ship.""  The prominent core developer said that while he was sure that Lightning could be a good system. He was noted that it will require more work to realise, as it's a much bigger project, one that also requires consensus from the community. ""It'll also require a soft fork to get off the ground,"" he concluded.  Despite these relative shortcomings, Todd praised the system. He said that Lightning was proposing that users change how they use bitcoin in exchange for allowing the system to scale, without decreasing its security. He pointed out that for those who think that bitcoin is potentially under threat of regulation or attack, this was a good trade off to make.  Dryja and Poon coincide with Todd's reservations, agreeing that more works needs to be done before the project can completely take off. Dryja said:  ""There's some foundational work that's needed before Lightning Network can be built out, not just the malleability fix and confirmations opcode. There's no widely used way to transfer data between participants; this impedes use of multi-sig even today.""  The developer confirmed that they were still looking into easy-to-use messaging and authentication, independent of the bitcoin network.  Poon confirmed that they are expecting to release a revised version of the white paper and that next steps would probably include the ""BIP (Bitcoin Improvement) and community input"".

42398292,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT7F2,1427378274,Isle of Man Introduces Regulation for Bitcoin Businesses,"Digital currency businesses will have to comply with the Isle of Man's anti-money laundering (AML) laws from 1st April and will likely fall under the remit of the Financial Services Commission from the summer.  The Isle of Man government has amended the Proceeds of Crime Act 2008 so it covers bitcoin companies, such as exchanges, operating from the island.  Amendments to the act have been approved and state the following businesses will have to adhere to AML requirements:  ""[Those in] the business of issuing, transmitting, transferring, providing safe custody or storage of, administering, managing, lending, buying, selling, exchanging or otherwise trading or intermediating convertible virtual currencies, including crypto-currencies or similar concepts where the concept is accepted by persons as a means of payment for goods or services, a unit of account, a store of value or a commodity.""  These companies will have to report to the authorities if they suspect a person using their business is engaged in money laundering. They will also have to assist in identifying the person they believe is involved.  This means cryptocurrency businesses will have to adopt certain know-your-customer (KYC) practices, collecting ID information so this can be passed on to the authorities if they suspect money-laundering activity.  Business registration  Amendments are also set to be made to the soon-to-be-introduced Designated Businesses (Registration and Oversight) Bill 2014, requiring the businesses mentioned above to register and be overseen by the Isle of Man Financial Services Commission (FSC).  The bill completed its passage through the island's legislature on Tuesday. Once it receives Royal Assent, which is expected to take place in the summer, the FSC will become the supervisory authority for AML matters.  In a Hansard document from 24th February, Phil Braidwood, a member of the Legislative Council and the Treasury, stated that schedule 1 of the bill will be updated to include the additional businesses outlined in the Proceeds of Crime Act amendment.  He went on to say that, once the bill is instated, the relevant companies will have six months to register with the FSC.  Positive news?  ""Taken together, these measures can only be positive for bitcoin businesses struggling to gain credibility and legitimacy with banks and consumers,"" said Siân Jones, co-founder of the European Digital Currency & Blockchain Technology Forum, adding:  ""With other changes currently taking place in the sterling clearing systems, the prospect of bank accounts for digital currencies takes a step closer.""  However, Adrian Forbes, co-founder of Isle of Man-based bitcoin company TGBEX, isn't quite so positive about the news.  ""It sends out a positive signal to companies looking at the Isle of Man as a jurisdiction, but the extra hassles/costs will put many startups off and seems unnecessary,"" he explained.  Currently, according to Forbes, TGBEX has to collect KYC and AML information from any customer wanting to purchase over €12,000-worth of bitcoins ($13,175), where as, under the new bill, it will need to collect information from anyone buying upwards of €1,000 ($1,096) in bitcoin.  Forbes believes the developments could be seen as good news for bitcoin exchanges, as the licence will increase their credibility, however, he still doesn't think banks will be willing to provide accounts to bitcoin business owners.  ""So it's just extra hassle and paperwork for everyone. Also, I can't help feeling it will have every major scam in crypto all over the world looking to come to the island in order to get a licence as well,"" he concluded.
