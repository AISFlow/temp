42421170,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXd50n,1651619781,The Woman Who Conquered COVID-19,"Meet Audrey Tang, the woman who beat COVID-19. She’s too modest to put it that way, of course. The Digital Minister of Taiwan is quick to say that “I’m just the face,” and that the real credit belongs to the people of Taiwan, who used a mix of open-source tech, crowdsourcing and blockchain-inspired innovation to develop a contract-tracing system that people actually used, keeping coronavirus cases low.  In one remarkable stretch, Taiwan went 200 days without a COVID-19 case, and without China-style lockdowns. The secret sauce? Thanks to privacy-protecting encryption, citizens were happy to scan QR codes and “check in” at every restaurant, store, bar or cafe. They did this without revealing their personal data. It worked so well that Taiwan reduced the contract tracing cycle to an astonishing 24 minutes.  It’s an unorthodox system, and Tang is anything but orthodox. She is many things: A genius who dropped out of school at the age of eight to focus on computer programming (your move, Marc Zuckerberg); a legendary developer in the open-source community; a hacktivist who helped the revolutionary “Sunflower movement” come to power in Taiwan; the nation’s youngest-ever minister; the nation’s first transgender minister; the nation’s first “minister without portfolio” (giving her a sweeping scope) and a believer in “radical transparency” – all of Tang’s communications are available to see online.  Blockchain plays a role in this. “I learned about fully homomorphic encryption [an encryption method that preserves privacy] by reading the latest research that came from the distributed ledger community,” says Tang, who prefers to use the word “ledger” over “blockchain.” She implemented tools that let Taiwan citizens quickly come to a consensus – not just about macro issues that you vote on every few years (such as who should lead the country), but on hyper-specific, real-time, micro issues such as “What is the best QR scanner to use for a contact tracing system?”  Read More: Can Taiwan Become Asia’s Crypto Haven? Not Yet  Audrey Tang is open sourcing and crowdsourcing democracy, and it’s working. Bonus? She figured out how to beat misinformation campaigns – using a strategy called “humor over rumor” – and suspects the model could work in the United States.  Ultimately, the system that Tang helped position, which she calls the Taiwan Model, helps us crack the “seeming dilemma of preserving privacy and human rights on one side, and tackling structural wicked problems” on the other side. Usually it’s either-or. Or as Tang puts it, “Too often it's phrased as a zero-sum game … and Taiwan is proving that no, you can actually have both.”  Here's how she did it.  Note: This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. Thanks to Tang’s policy of radical transparency, you can read the entire, unabridged conversation at her website.  What have been your most important goals since you assumed the role of Digital Minster?  I'm a “lowercase minister,” a digital minister, meaning that I don't give orders and I don't take orders either. And the entire idea is that what matters is to work with the people, and not for the people. “For the people” means that maybe you know better than people do, right? But “with the people” means that we need to constantly build the mechanisms, the spaces.  What do you mean by the mechanisms?  Toll-free numbers, a daily press conference and many other things to make sure that people know exactly what's going on without having to invest a lot of research by themselves. To build a ladder of expertise on anything that might be controversial or require public input.  So, of course, the [response to the] pandemic is the [best known example.] I think only we in Taiwan are still doing COVID-zero with Omicron. I don't think anyone else is doing that now. … We've not instilled a single day of lockdown. It's literally based on people voluntarily participating in data collaboratives, such as contact tracing, because they know that when they scan the QR code their phone number or nothing about them will go to the venue owner, so it's privacy-preserving.  A lot of it actually came from the zk-based [zero knowledge-based proofs] research from the Web 3 field, right? I learned about fully homomorphic encryption by reading the latest research that came from the distributed ledger [blockchain] community. But then we put it into use, because people understand that if it saves their time and makes them feel safer, then they are willing to participate and also contribute to make a better QR code scanner that rejects any other QR code and so on.  What else is involved?  Basically, all the components in the current contact tracing get a lot of input from not just the social sector, but also the private sector – like our leading antivirus company Trend Micro, or LINE, which is our equivalent of WhatsApp in Taiwan. So they all got into this ecosystem of shortening contact tracing from 24 hours to 24 minutes. And people can reverse-audit in the past four weeks [to see] which contact tracing, which municipality have looked at your data. So there's reverse accountability to ensure that it's deleted after four weeks.  Read More: This Taiwanese Fintech Wants to Bridge the World Using Stablecoins  We’ve built similar relationships with the data collaboratives to counter infodemics as well, which is less widely reported. So my hope is to keep this “With the People” paradigm going strong, so people don’t have to give up when seeing the seeming-dilemma of preserving privacy and human rights on one side and tackling structural-wicked problems, like the [coronavirus] pandemic or info-demic, on the other side. Too often it's phrased as a zero-sum game, like there's a dial here somewhere, right? And Taiwan is proving that, no, you can actually have both if you work with the people, not just for the people.  You mentioned how you work to counter “infodemics.” What do you mean by this exactly?  So, parallel to the pandemic is the infodemic. The thing that reduced the effectiveness of NPIs [non-pharmaceutical interventions] in other jurisdictions. Like if the people believe that there’s a 5G antenna in a mask. [Laughs.]  Oh, so misinformation campaigns?  Or intentional disinformation campaigns. [Or] information manipulation leading up to elections, and so on. Of course, the U.S., being an advanced democracy, doesn’t have that.  [Both laugh.] We need you! We need you here in the U.S.! Okay, but seriously, clearly the United States does have, as you say, an “infodemic.” The U.S. has a big problem there. Can you elaborate on the tools you put in place in Taiwan to stop this?  So we call it humor over rumor. It's very simple. [By analogy], the idea is how some vaccines are made. You take a trending viral virus variant, take its mRNA strands, and put it into a different spike protein configuration and then release it. So it gets even more viral than the [original] virus itself.  Okay, I think I’m following …  The idea is that we have this trending scoreboard of which “viruses of the mind” are getting the highest R-value [a measure of how fast a virus spreads.] … So suppose we know this [misinformation] has an R-value of 10. Like, on average, one person spreads this information to 10 other people. So we focus on that … and then we take some mRNA strands [by analogy], and then we put out a really funny meme.  What’s an example?  Before the pandemic, there was viral disinformation that said, “The state is going to fine you $1 million if you perm your hair twice or more a week.” Do you believe it? But it's actually viral. It’s trending.  And then our premier, within two hours … wrote this extremely funny meme where we quote the disinformation and say it's not true.  Then the premier, who is in his 70s now, posted a photo of him as a young man with a lot of hair. And the young man said, ""So it's not true. I used to have hair. I would not punish people who look like my youth."" And a fine print that says, ""What you've seen in the rumors are actually a labeling requirement for the warnings that the labels of the manufacturer of those hair products, they must be printed on that bottle. So the fine goes to the manufacturer or the bottler if they don't put in a warning label.""  Read More: Safeguarding Our Privacy in an Age of Transparency  The “viral payload” is the premier, as he looks now, with almost no hair, and then with a hair blower, and said, ""But if you perm your hair many times a week, it will not damage your bank account, it will damage your hair. Your hairstyle may become my hairstyle.” So he makes fun of himself, and it's very convincing.  That went absolutely viral. Much more viral than the disinformation. And the people who laughed about it, who vented their outrage, literally became immune when they see the original disinformation. They don't spread it anymore ... because they have already vented.  Ah, I get it. You're giving an outlet for conspiracy theories and absurdist rumors? A safe, healthy, innocent outlet. And once that thirst has been slaked, they're not as likely to fall prey to the actual rumors. So your team is intentionally creating fantastical funny rumors that are not true, and hoping they’ll go viral?  Exactly. Pneumatic engineering. Yes.  Incredible. And with the “R scores,” you’re tracking both the real rumors – the “viruses of the mind” – and the fake, humor rumors?  The vaccines. Yes.  Do you think that would work in the U.S.?  Yes, definitely. And all it takes is a kind of self-deprecating humor from the leadership.  That’s so interesting. On a related note, I understand that “radical transparency” is a foundational value of yours. Why is that so important to you, and how can it benefit society?  Because it enables timely consensus, and the ledger [blockchain] community of all communities understands this. If you don't get a high bandwidth in terms of transaction per second and a low latency for a consensus, well, there really is no reason why people should invest in the governance equations, because whatever they propose will take forever to be ratified.  And, of course, in open source you can always fork, but that's not feasible for many communities. You can't really fork the community relationships with you, right? If it's that easy, Facebook would have been forked like a trillion times by now, right? So the right to fork, while fundamental, and I respect the software freedoms which is essentially the right to fork, is just the right to exit.  But what we're building with timely, real-time, radical transparency is the right to voice. The right to matter in governance settings, in a way that doesn't squander your own cognitive resources and can actually ripple through the consent of the governed. To build “consensus of the governed,” so to speak.  What do you mean exactly?  In an epidemic setting, this is even more important. Because if mask distribution, or contact tracing, or vaccination only works in some pockets of population or some pockets of cities … then it creates internal division that drives the party apart. And we've seen many other jurisdictions where the national and the municipal governments were on completely different sides. And if they do that a couple of times, people lose all trust in the counter epidemic measures, because their mayor said a different thing from the chancellor, or from the premier, and so on.  We can definitely relate to this in the U.S. …  But if, through this real-time, open API, the cabinet minister can very easily say, “Yeah, the municipal version is correct. It's been proven by the open-street map community. There's no qualms about that.” And then 24 hours later, we integrate that into the consensus. So then it's always a backward-compatible soft fork. There is always a right to fork in democratic policies. But the fork is soft, meaning that it's backward compatible. And the mainline has a timely way to integrate, meaning that we just abandon our original errors of our ways and simply say that the software is now the new reality. Maybe we call it London or something.  Let me try and summarize. So it's the extremely efficient, real-time communication that you've instilled that allows a constant understanding of what people want?  That's right.  And the people, by having their voice clearly heard, don’t necessarily have governance. It’s not like, if 80% of the people in Taiwan approve of a certain solution it’s law. It’s not a direct democracy. But it’s a clear demonstration of what they want?  It's agenda. It's agenda-setting power.  Right. Got it. But I’m still a little fuzzy on what you mean by the “soft fork”?  Yeah. So once the agenda is known, not just to the premier or the minister but a crowdsourced agenda is known for everyone, then instead of just the government's contractors delivering solutions, actually, everyone is free to experiment in their vicinity on solutions.  Ah, I’m starting to get it …  Last May [2020] when we had our real first [COVID-19] wave … there were literally more than 20 contact tracing solutions going on in just three days. … Pretty much all the contact tracing makers are on the same [communication] channel, and we are just working very diligently so that within a couple of days we converged on the SMS-based, open standard QR code contact tracing where everyone can implement their own QR code scanner but nobody keeps personal data. And that was the consensus of the contact tracing tool makers.  Read More: Crypto Industry Mobilizes Against Proposed EU Transparency Rules  So I didn't program the tool myself, but I did what we call a “reverse-procurement.” The specification is defined by the internet civic community. It's taken as a national standard, so that we then take that to ask our vendors and contractors in the private sector to build to the spec that those small-scale experiments have already validated.  It's pretty much the only working way. So crowdsource agenda setting is one, but open innovation co-creation is the other. And these two working together is like a double diamond, right? You get to diverge, converge, diverge, converge very quickly.  How do you feel knowing that you saved a lot of lives? As I understand it, you are the key figure motivating this open-source massive experiment on a national scale. No other country has done this. You’ve trounced COVID-19 thanks to this.  I think we call it the Taiwan model, so the ""you"" is definitely plural. You is not just me. I'm just the face, right? The spokesperson of a huge community of civic tech and government tech.  But I think it is really a model. It's not just for the pandemic and the infodemic. It could also be used to fight climate change, or all sorts of inequity and injustice that people previously thought must result in the loss of one or the other.  After they got introduced into this way of thinking, then they can actually design solutions that work for the true betterment of next generations and so on. Because it's much easier to take the plurality into account if you know, as a fact, that 8,000 people starting a movement online with a popular hashtag is actually a force of good, instead of a force to disrupt. …  So it's a really good thing that we can show those concrete solutions that, as you've said, have saved people's lives. Because then people think, ""Oh, if we can actually get the COVID and especially Omnicron [variant] to net-zero, then maybe it's not hard to tackle the carbon dioxide thing, to get it to net-zero."" It instills optimism into all the sectors.  I enjoyed this. Congrats on your success.  Thank you. [Raises hand in Vulcan salute.] Live long and prosper.

It has not been spared from the general market downtrend that has rocked the crypto space and has since lost its footing above $3,000, a crucial point for the digital asset. Nevertheless, it seems the future is not at all gloomy for the second-largest cryptocurrency going by reports from a Finder&apos;s panel. Ethereum To Surge 100% A recent Finder&apos;s panel made up of industry experts has released an extremely bullish long-term outlook for the cryptocurrency. The panel which took part in the quarterly survey from Finder consisted of 36 industry experts who shared their forecasts for the digital asset. According to them, Ethereum may very well still be in the early stages of its growth price-wise. The digital asset which is currently trading a little above $2,800 received some of the best feedback and the consensus was that there is much growing to do in 2022 alone.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Most cryptos decline as investors await the U.S. central bank's likely decision to increase interest rates a half-point.  Insights: Minnows show their commitment to bitcoin.  Technician's take: BTC is at risk of a breakdown as price momentum slows.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at approximately $37,800, down over 2% over the past 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at about $2,800, off similarly for the same period. Most other major cryptos were in the red, albeit not by much. SOL, ADA and AVAX had all recently fallen more than a percentage point. CRO and TRX each rose roughly 5% and ALGO jumped nearly 6% a day after announcing that it would become the official blockchain platform of FIFA, soccer's world governing body.  ""The macro issues, whether it's the Ukraine war, global supply chain issues and inflation that's affecting every other country as far as leading the Fed to tighten its policies, and in times like these risky assets generally don't perform well,"" Kapril Rathi, co-founder and CEO of digital asset trading platform CrossTower, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""One can argue crypto is pretty much in the same category as tech in terms of risk. We see macro pressure on tech and cryptos at the same time.""  The Federal Reserve has been widely expected to begin a more hawkish approach to taming inflation, which has hit 40-year highs and threatens to increase further amid Russia's continued aggression in neighboring Ukraine. The conflict has sent energy prices skyrocketing as many countries look to alternatives from Russian energy, and supply chains have suffered ongoing delays. The price of Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of energy markets, dropped slightly from Monday but was still trading at about $105 per barrel, up about 40% since the start of the year.  In a report, Arcane Research noted that futures premiums remained historically low, ""signaling persistent pessimism from active market participants,"" and that the Fear and Greed Index was registering “Fear” or “Extreme Fear,” for a fourth consecutive week, its longest period of fearful market sentiment this year.  Rathi struck a cautiously optimistic tone about bitcoin's pricing later in the year. ""In the next six to nine months, we will see an important role that bitcoin will play as countries deal with inflation so I am expecting a bounce back in the market.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,175 +0.4%  DJIA: 33,128 +0.2%  Nasdaq: 12,563 +0.2%  Gold: $1,867 +0.2%  Insights  The conviction of bitcoin minnows  Bitcoin opened the week in the red, with no relief in Asia and support hitting the $37,000 mark.  As the market continues to be range-bound and not make any aggressive moves in an upward direction, Glassnode has noted in a recent report that the newest ""Long Term Holders"" (defined as those who bought before bitcoin’s all-time high in October 2021) are “peering into the abyss of holding unprofitable positions” and are preparing to capitulate and sell off like their peers that have held for longer are already doing.  “The current market structure for bitcoin remains in an extremely delicate equilibrium, with short-term price action and network profitability leaning bearish, whilst long-term trends remain constructive. The capitulation of Long-Term Holders appears to be continuing,” Glassnode wrote.  In prior reports, Glassnode has noted that there’s a great redistributing occurring in crypto where the long-term holders panic sell to new entrants.  We’ve called this cohort the minnows, as these mighty but small fish have bought crypto from large-holder whales because of their conviction in the asset class.  And these minnows continue to grow and multiply. Despite that the last month has been comparatively boring and compressed for the markets the supply held by wallets with between 0.1-10 BTC has continued to rise to the point where they collectively hold 2.5 million bitcoin.  There’s a long way to go until the ""flippening"" happens. Glassnode thinks this trend could be reversed if the minnows find themselves outside their pain tolerance. After all, Glassnode points to $46,910 as the entry point for most of these short-term holders, putting the average coin held by a minnow at an unrealized loss of -17.9%.  The question is, when will these short-term holders capitulate? Many of the long-term holder whales are professional investors or funds that can afford to lose, whereas minnows are retail investors. Long-term investors also have a conviction in the asset class; that’s why they invest. But they also have a profit and loss statement to publish to their fund subscribers at the end of the month, and these capital allocators won’t like seeing lots of red.  Retail investors, however, are usually purely based on conviction and ideology. If bitcoin continues to be range-bound below $46,000, where many of them entered, it will be interesting to see the strength of their convictions and how long they last.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Stalls Below $40K Resistance, Support at $30K-$32K  Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hold support above $37,500, but could face higher volatility over the next few days.  The cryptocurrency was roughly flat over the past 24 hours and over the past week. That indicates indecision among traders – a common theme so far this year.  Momentum signals have weakened on daily, weekly and monthly charts, which increases the chance of a breakdown in price. Lower support is seen at around $30,000-$32,000, which could stabilize pullbacks over the short term.  Still, other technical indicators are neutral, which means intraday buying could be short-lived. There is strong resistance at $46,700 that could cap upside moves, similar to what occurred in late March.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart has remained below 50 (a neutral reading) over the past month. The last time the RSI sustained low readings was last November and December, which preceded a price drop below $46,000.  For now, buyers have failed to maintain consecutive weekly closes above $40,000, which is the midpoint of a three-month price range.

42420824,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcQ9,1651613197,"‘Smart Money’ Is Staking ETH on Rocket Pool and Selling ENS, Nansen Data Suggests","Highly successful cryptocurrency traders have been staking their ether (ETH) on the Rocket Pool decentralized node operator network and offloading ENS, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen.  In the past 24 hours, $1.37 million worth of rETH has flowed into wallets categorized by Nansen as “smart money,” more than any other token tracked by the firm.  Nansen considers a wallet to be “smart money” if it meets at least one of several conditions, including:  It is known to belong to an investment fund  It has made at least $100,000 by providing liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, SushiSwap and Uniswap, excluding so-called impermanent loss  It has made multiple profitable trades on a decentralized exchange (DEX) in a single transaction, through mechanisms such as “flash loans”  rETH is an ERC-20 token people receive for depositing ETH into Rocket Pool’s decentralized Ethereum staking protocol. Instead of staking the full 32 ETH required to run an Ethereum proof-of-stake validator, participants can contribute as little as 0.01 ETH to Rocket Pool and earn a share of its validator rewards. Smart Money inflows of rETH reflect the popularity of staking ETH among crypto traders, investors and institutions.  Of the 12.31 million ether locked in the Beacon Chain staking contract, 169,216 ETH comes from Rocket Pool, while 3.97 million ETH stems from Lido, Rocket Pool’s key competitor. CoinDesk’s Sam Kessler has written that Lido “might be on track to control over 50% of all staked ether,” which for some is a good reason to raise alarm bells given the risk of centralization. With rETH entering smart money addresses, the competition in the fast-growing liquid staking market is rising.  Over the same 24-hour period, roughly $5.9 million worth of ENS has left smart money wallets, the biggest outflow among tokens tracked by Nansen. Outflows are considered a bearish signal. Since 10 a.m. UTC Tuesday, ENS prices have dropped 11.89% using data from CoinGecko.  ENS is the governance token for the Ethereum Name Service where one token represents one vote. Token holders are encouraged to use ENS and participate in the community by choosing a representative to control their votes or by using their ENS to vote directly on a given proposal. Early last month, the ENS decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voted on whether to remove Brantly Millegan, one of the three directors of the Ethereum Name Service Foundation, for his homophobic and transphobic tweets in the past. Active for a week, the vote to remove Millegan failed.  Yuga Labs’ Otherdeed for Otherside continues to dominate the non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem. It led all other NFT collections for the second consecutive day as the most actively traded collection in the last 24 hours. Coming in second is Mutant Ape Yacht Club, followed by Bored Ape Yacht Club, two projects also created by Yuga Labs.  Given the historic highs for gas fees across the Ethereum network due to the high demand for the Otherside “virtual land sale,” Yuga Labs indicated in a tweet Sunday that Otherdeed minters with failed transactions will be refunded. Moreover, the company suggested ApeCoin DAO should start thinking about building its own dedicated blockchain to properly scale large NFT projects.",POSITIVE,ETH | ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | ENS | RPL,Sage D.

42423429,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ZMrh,1651610395,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Traders Take Some Profits Ahead of Fed Meeting, Expect Higher Volatility","Cryptocurrencies were mixed on Tuesday, indicating uncertainty among traders ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate decision tomorrow.  The Fed is expected to hike rates by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point), which would be the first half point rise in 22 years. And over the next few meetings, the Fed could raise rates expeditiously to slow the pace of inflation.  Many central banks outside of the U.S., particularly in emerging markets, have already started to raise interest rates. Meanwhile, the combination of slower economic growth and tighter monetary policy has weighed on speculative assets including stocks and cryptos.  The Fed meeting could be a source of rising volatility, according to some analysts. For example, FundStrat, a global advisory firm noticed a rise in ether's (ETH) put/call ratio since the beginning of the year, which means option traders have started to hedge against further price declines.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  Bitcoin (BTC) has been roughly flat over the past week, struggling below $40,000, which is the midpoint of a three-month price range. Technical indicators show a decline in upside momentum over the past month, which could increase the risk of a price breakdown. That means upside could be limited going forward.  For now, analysts expect higher volatility in cryptos, tracking moves in equity markets.  ""Bitcoin has seen relative strength neutralize versus ether, perhaps reflecting indecisiveness among investors who are confused as to whether the risk-off in equities will be a bigger drag on cryptos,"" Katie Stockton, managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, a technical research firm, wrote in a research note.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $37,711, −1.98%    ●Ether (ETH): $2,772, −2.28%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,175, +0.48%    ●Gold: $1,866, per troy ounce, +0.23%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.96%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Profit taking ahead of volatility  Long-term bitcoin holders are starting to take some profits, which has been a source of selling pressure over the past few months.  The chart below shows the recent decline in the cost basis of long-term holders overlaid with the average selling price (currently around $38,000, indicating zero profit).  So far, profit taking among long-term holders is occurring at the most significant rate in bitcoin's history, according to Glassnode data. ""This indicates that long-term holders from the 2021-2022 cycle are capitulating, spending and redistributing their coins, specifically during the last three months,"" the firm wrote in a blog post.  For short-term holders, realized losses are much worse. ""The on-chain cost basis of short-term holders is at $46,910, putting the average coin held by this cohort at an unrealized loss of -17.9%,"" Glassnode wrote.  Currently, about 70% of all BTC holders are in profit (30% held at a loss). In previous crypto bear markets, between 45%-57% of the market was in profit, according to Glassnode's data, which suggests more time before a price low is reached.

The company also announced Andrew Kang will take over from Phong Le as chief financial officer, effective on or about May 9, after which Le will continue in his role as MicroStrategy's president. Kang was previously the CFO of tech company Greensky Inc.  The digital asset impairment reflects the decline in the price of bitcoin (BTC) versus the price at which the bitcoin was acquired. Under standard accounting rules, the value of digital assets such as cryptocurrencies must be recorded at their cost and then only adjusted if their value is impaired, or goes down. But if the price rises, that does not get reported unless an asset is sold.  For 2021, MicroStrategy posted total digital asset impairment losses of $831 million, versus $71 million in 2020.  The company's 129,218 bitcoins held at the end of March 31, 2022, were acquired for $3.97 billion, reflecting an average cost per bitcoin of approximately $30,700, the company reported. At bitcoin’s current price of about $37,662, the value of those holdings is approximately $4.9 billion.  Led by bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has continued to accumulate bitcoin at a rapid pace. At the end of March, MicroStrategy secured a $205 million loan from Silvergate Bank (SI) backed by its existing bitcoin holdings to potentially buy more bitcoin.  MicroStrategy's CFO Phong Le said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that bitcoin would need to fall about half from current levels before a margin call would occur on the Silvergate loan. However, Le added that MicroStrategy could contribute more bitcoin to the collateral package and avoid that scenario.  Between Feb. 15 and April 4, MicroStrategy acquired 4,167 bitcoin for $190.5 million, reflecting an average price of $45,714 per bitcoin.  In January, the software firm said it would stop reporting adjusted results for impairment losses and gains on sales related to bitcoin in response to objections from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  MicroStrategy shares were down about 0.1% to $343.20 in after-hours trading Tuesday. Shares have fallen around 37% year to date.

The agency described that unit – which resides in the Division of Enforcement – as being responsible for “protecting investors in crypto markets and from cyber-related threats.”  SEC Chairman Gary Gensler previously indicated in September that he had plans to expand the unit’s staff.  Dubbed “Crypto Mom” by many in the industry for being crypto savvy, Peirce has been a longtime opponent Gensler’s enforcement-heavy approach to regulation. Gensler has been reluctant to share specifics on how crypto companies can comply with regulations, instead choosing to regulate through enforcement actions.  Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), co-chairman of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, who has previously criticized the “overregulation” of crypto, appeared to echo Peirce’s sentiment, retweeting it with the “finger pointing down” emoji.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was down 1.2% in the past 24 hours to around $37,719, as of press time.  A major market talking point in recent weeks has been bitcoin's elevated correlation with U.S. stocks, especially the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 Index. But the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were both in positive territory on Tuesday, as crypto markets appeared to suffer from negative sentiment.  “Bitcoin is steadying ahead of the [Federal Open Market Committee] as crypto traders await to see if Wall Street has come close to pricing in peak Fed hawkishness,” said Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya.  Read more: Fed Meeting Decision Looks Baked, But Outlook is Far From Certain  “Bitcoin will continue to trade as a risky asset until further progress is made with the Lightning network,” said Moya. “Bitcoin needs a fresh catalyst, and progress in the peer-to-peer payment network might be what is needed to revitalize crypto bulls.”  “Since late March, the bears have been intensifying from $39K, forming a sequence of lower highs,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst FxPro. “At the same time, the basis in the form of support at $38K generally remains untouched.”  Kuptsikevich said the crypto market seems to have “laid at the bottom.” There is a high supply of coins for sale and reluctance to “take active actions in anticipation of the Fed’s decision.”  “According to Coin ATM Radar, the global bitcoin ATM installation rate declined for the fourth consecutive month in April,” Kuptsikevich said.  Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said that “despite the fears surrounding bitcoin volatility, data from @ecoinometrics shows how bitcoin’s volatility is actually less than many tech stocks, including Apple [AAPL] and Meta [FB].”  “It is clear that every halving leads to less volatility as the asset matures and is adopted more,” Sotiriou said.

42421604,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoiC5,1651598223,An Ape Ain’t Free: In Defense of Ethereum’s Fees,"The weekend of April 30 featured two different blockchain blowups that together illustrate the importance of how transaction fees are set on decentralized systems. Late on Saturday U.S. Eastern time, the Solana blockchain fell out of consensus and effectively shut down for what wound up being seven hours, reportedly thanks to a swarm of bots trying to mint non-fungible tokens (NFT). Then on Sunday, Yuga Labs’ launch of a sale for land NFTs triggered a spike in transaction fees on Ethereum. That led hopeful NFT buyers to spend a total of about 71,000 ether (ETH), or nearly $200 million USD, on fees alone.  So Solana users couldn’t use the chain at all for about seven hours, potentially costing them huge sums in missed trades or other financial opportunities. Ethereum users, by contrast, were free to use the chain even at the height of Yuga's sale … if they were willing to spend huge sums, sacrificing other financial opportunities.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It’s a devilish trade-off, broadly representing the two currently existing approaches to handling transaction demand on a blockchain. Neither, it seems pretty clear, is an acceptable status quo.  It’s worth emphasizing that, despite the chaos, there’s a lot of good news here. Both Solana and Ethereum experienced incredible surges of real system demand, and that’s the overriding goal.  Even the swooning sales price of Solana’s SOL token, which dropped as much as 11% after the chain pause, is arguably structurally bullish. That a blockchain token price dipped because of a failure of its technology stack and (in)ability to handle real traffic is an inverted validation of many of the precepts and principles that underpin the entire crypto and blockchain industry, not least Joel Monegro’s “fat protocols” thesis. It’s a marked and refreshing change from the puffery, rumors, and affinity trends that have had predominant influence over token markets for most of the past decade.  There's no such thing as a free lunch  By the same token (ahem), it turns out the two systems’ different approaches to big demand spikes really, really matter.  Both systems have transaction fees, and the weekend’s events show why it’s hard to imagine any digital payment system without them. There is limited space within each transaction block on any blockchain, and fees at the very least prevent every single block from being packed to the gills with malicious spam. Without fees, any system could and probably would be spammed into oblivion sheerly for the lulz, or accidentally by a rogue bot or the like.  Ethereum solves this problem with a fairly straightforward fee market – users bid against each other for block space. When you set your desired fee ranges in MetaMask, you’re setting your fee bid range, with lower bids usually having to wait longer to win a slot and be validated. This pure market means that fees can range very high indeed when traffic peaks, and Yuga’s kerfuffle on Sunday, with fees briefly brushing $24, doesn’t even take the cake. As recently as late winter of 2021, Ethereum fees were nearly $10 for months on end, and spiked to more than $70 last May, according to Ycharts – also, notably, in large part thanks to NFT-driven demand.  Solana takes a different approach. While fees on Solana do respond to congestion, they are set algorithmically based on recent block space usage, rather than by a real-time bid-based market. This approach appears to have failed on Saturday by underpricing blockspace relative to supply. That enabled a flood of transactions that were nominally accepted by the network, but too much for validators to process. That, in turn, led to forks that could not be pruned fast enough, destroying network consensus and forcing a human-coordinated restart.  It's important to note that while the Solana pause has been blamed on “bots,” that doesn’t mean this was a malicious attack. Instead, automated bots were trying to win an NFT mint through the Candy Machine dapp, following the logic of a rational economic actor hoping to make a profit. In part because of the way transaction fees are set on Solana, it was apparently entirely rational for these agents to “spam” millions of transactions onto the chain.  It is somewhat strange, then, to see that the Candy Machine developers, Metaplex, announce it will implement “a botting penalty” within the dapp itself. It’s a fine gesture, just not a long-term solution. Solana, like all legitimate blockchains, can be used by anyone, so this change to a single dapp wouldn’t prevent anyone else from building another tool with the precise dynamics that brought the network down. At least at first glance, it seems Solana’s fee mechanism may be the more fundamental challenge.  But revising Solana’s fee structure could be a messaging problem for the system’s backers. Like many purported “Ethereum killers,” Solana has been marketed to a significant degree based on its ability to handle more transactions faster and for lower cost than the Second Chain. Solana’s homepage currently touts “Low cost, forever. Solana's scalability ensures transactions remain less than $0.01 for both developers and users.”  But it seems increasingly likely those fees are artificially low. Solana had a similar shutdown last September, caused by a similar surge in transaction demand. A postmortem written by developers said the outage was “in effect, a denial of service attack,” or what could again broadly be described as transaction spam. Bots and excess spam have been linked to nearly a dozen chain pauses on Solana in recent months.  So as frustrating as it can be to have Ethereum’s fees spike to $24 or $70 or, who knows, someday even higher, it may be worth the trade-off if those high fees help discourage activity that risks throwing the network out of consensus. Pick your poison: low fees on a chain that could collapse when transaction demand outstrips blockspace; or unpredictable, sometimes very high fees on a stable chain. The good news is there is a lot of ongoing work to escape the horns of that dilemma, with possible solutions including sharding and parachains.  Another fix on the table would be major projects like Bored Apes spinning up their own independent layer 1 blockchains, which Yuga Labs may be planning. But that has its own trade-offs because it would almost certainly involve some form of cross-chain bridge, and those seem increasingly risky in their own right.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,David Z.

The value of assets staked using Lido has increased to almost 18 billion USD since its introduction at the end of 2020, and Lido has spread to five blockchains. Lido went operational in December 2020, just a few weeks after the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain. Staking on the Ethereum blockchain has several drawbacks. Only multiples of 32 ETH can be staked. There are also operational hurdles, such as the requirement for technical competence to participate. Furthermore, the staked ETH is tied to the ETH 2.0 first phase and cannot be utilized in any other protocol. Lido&apos;s non-custodial staking services try to address these difficulties. This is in contrast to the staking services provided by exchanges. The issuance of stETH, a tokenized version of staked ETH, solves the capital inefficiency problem. Users can still use their staked money in other protocols with this token. Lido&apos;s initial focus was Ethereum, but it is now branching out to other blockchains. Staking on Terra began in March 2021, and staking on Solana started in September 2021. Stakeholders of Terra&apos;s native LUNA asset or Solana&apos;s SOL asset receive a derivative token, similar to Ethereum (bLUNA or stSOL).

42421184,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXd5DB,1651592223,Matt Medved: The Four Factors That Make NFTs Successful,"Keeping a finger on the pulse of the fast-moving non-fungible token world isn’t an easy feat. But Matt Medved took on that challenge last year and cofounded NFT Now, an online outlet focused on all things NFT.  Majoring in journalism at Northwestern University and having a deep interest in dance music, Medved served as editor-in-chief of music and culture magazine Spin and also founded Billboard’s dance/electronic music vertical Billboard Dance.  To his disappointment, when he ventured into the NFT space after first hearing about and becoming fascinated with the technology in late 2020, there wasn’t much in the way of trustworthy and independent information on this nascent industry. With his long track record of professional publishing, Medved knew NFT Now was the logical next step for him.  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  Medved had an eclectic and fairly global career – not only as a magazine publisher but also a DJ and a non-profit worker. While completing law and master's degrees from George Washington University, he carried out human rights research in Nigeria for global conflict resolution NGO Search for Common Ground. He also spent a year in South Korea teaching English. As a professional DJ, he performed at top-notch festivals including Tomorrowland in Belgium. For a wide-compassing cultural ecosystem like NFTs, all that bedrock of skills and experiences comes quite handy.  Despite his past being deeply rooted in the music industry, he’s not a music NFT maximalist. He’s bullish on the space as a whole – and that also extends to less-sexy NFT stuff like property deeds and government record-keeping. After all, NFT as a technology is transformative and cuts across use cases, and it’s the underlying technology that excites Medved.  As he makes apparent in this interview, Medved sounds most excited about historical NFTs like Rare Pepes. Those collections didn’t have financial incentives in mind (in contrast to today’s NFT projects) and they were all about the creative use of technology – the purest synergy between artistic expression and technological deployment.  Medved, a speaker at CoinDesk’s Consensus festival in June, spoke with CoinDesk from his home in New York City.  You come from a family of medical professionals like me. In my experience, especially for medical families, there's an expectation that kids will be inspired by their parents' practice. And yet, we both ended up in the world of NFTs and publishing somehow. How did that happen?!  That's a great question. I do feel really fortunate. My dad is a neurologist. My mother is a nurse and a genetic counselor, but they never pressured me to pursue a medical career. They were really good about supporting me in my areas of passion, which for my upbringing were always writing and music. Writing from an early age – creative writing, poetry camps, stuff like that.  While in Milan during 2013, I discovered bitcoin [BTC] and started doing crypto. I was really just dabbling, bought the top of that market, which, in fact, crashed two weeks later. But I've just held on to it [because] I believed in the technology.  And I really started to get more interested in cryptocurrency and the blockchain space during the peak years of Billboard Dance, like 2016 to 2018, which coincided with the bull run.  Just by virtue of being really involved in the dance music space, I knew a lot of artists that were really at the forefront of that. We knew this had the power to empower artists, but it was about figuring out how. To me, it was NFTs that ended up being that missing puzzle piece.  3LAU [founder of music NFT platform Royal] pulled me down the NFT rabbit hole in fall 2020. For me, it was just a call with him, and every light bulb was going off in my head. I was, like, “This is the technology I've believed in for a long time. It’s finally disrupting what I'm actually passionate about – music, art and culture.”  That's when I became someone who was singularly focused on the NFT space. We launched the NFT Now social accounts in January 2021 because we felt like there was a real need for an independent, credible voice in the space. We started seeing tremendous growth and realized that we had an opportunity to build something really special. My co-founders Alejandro [and] Sam and I took it from there.  Given your past experiences and areas of interest, would you say you are most bullish on music NFTs?  It's funny, actually. I am very bullish on music NFTs but I actually surprised a lot of people when I first got into the space. People expected me to be all about music NFTs and really focus on that. To be honest, I love music and I am very bullish on it – I do think it will disrupt the industry.  But I was really fascinated by the historical NFTs movement that led to the boom in mainstream attention of NFTs. I actually dove really head-deep in crypto art and started learning about the crypto art OGs, like the early artists on SuperRare, the early pioneers in Namecoin, Rare Pepes and all that.  Crypto-native culture drives so much of the space. And for me, I already knew a lot about the music industry, I knew a lot about music. I was actually enamored by the elements of discovery to learn this history. I've always been fascinated by history across everything – from music history, to real history in real life.  It's interesting because I actually became really fascinated by the history of crypto art and generative art. One of the things that I love so much about NFTs on the blockchain is that the receipts are all there, right? I was going through the first artists to make them on SuperRare, and learning about XCOPY, Sarah Zucker and all of these artists that have been pushing things forward.  That said, I am extremely bullish on music NFTs. I have so many friends in the industry – the artist side, industry side and so on – who have been hitting me up trying to get more information or understanding. For me, it was really, really heartening to see that because I think for a long time, we were trying to get anyone in the music industry to care about this. Now, it's something that they just can't afford to ignore.  What is about historical NFTs that appeal to you?  I don't think that just being old is enough but I think that as we continue down this path, historical NFTs are going to be a smaller percentage of the overall [NFT landscape].  One thing I actually love about historical projects is that a lot of them were created without the same financial calculus that we see in projects today. That's one thing that originally drew me to CryptoPunks – the idea that they were given away, they were an experiment. I love artists like XCOPY who were experimenting on SuperRare, who never expected their works to be selling for seven figures in their life. There's something really special about that creative expression.  How do you feel about the fact that there are a lot of scammers trying to exploit the NFT space? How do you handle tons of NFT pitches you receive every day, some of which could be rugpulls in the making?  I think you bring up a really good point. As you can probably guess, my DMs are an absolute nightmare. I'm being bombarded from every angle on everything. A lot of those projects seem suspect, and there are a lot of people who don't act in good faith.  Our mission for NFT Now is to empower the creators of culture and drive mainstream adoption of NFTs. Part of the latter includes education. I think we have a responsibility to protect newcomers to the space. We hold our editorial standards to the highest caliber.  We have actually now solved a tough problem that we were having, which was finding trustworthy, credible information and resources on the NFT space. When we got into the space, we found that the climate was really characterized by platforms with megaphones promoting their own drops, and also talking to influencers shilling their own bags. We were like, “Where is the Billboard of the NFT space? And where is that independent, credible brand that is trustworthy and in the loop?” That's what we're building with NFT Now.  As someone who wants to bring a billion people into Web 3 or NFTs, I believe that this technology is going to fundamentally redefine how creators and their communities create shared value together.  All of these scams and rugpulls are really scary because the last thing that I want to see happen is what happened with the [initial coin offering] boom in 2017, 2018 where a lot of good people dipped their toes in the water and got burned. A lot of them left with a bad taste in their mouth, and some of them have not returned to the space. The last thing that I want to see is for newcomers to the NFT space to be burned similarly, and to be turned off from what I think is an incredibly powerful and transformational technology for empowerment.  From what you've seen and experienced so far, what are the qualities of a good NFT project?  That's a great question. I always weigh projects according to four core factors. To me, those factors are artistry, community, history and utility.  I want to say first and foremost, artistry is enough in its own right. Artists who are genuinely expressing their creative vision are creating value for the space. I know there’s a lot of debate right now around the artistry versus utility side. I don't think artists should be pressured into adding utility. There are some interesting creative ways – if they feel inclined – to build a community around what they do.  Community, obviously, for a lot of these projects, is the key factor. The way I define the difference between audience and communities is that an audience knows you exist and are aware of you but a community actually wants to see you win and feels invested in you. We've seen in the rise of these collectible PFP projects that the community is often the biggest determining factor to a project’s success.  When it comes to utility, I do think that there are some really interesting and exciting use cases for NFTs, [such as] provable membership and immutable record keeping.  What about NFT project founders? What qualities do you look at there?  I think the biggest thing is for founders to make it very clear that they are here to create value, and not extract value from the space. Oftentimes, that’s the reason why the space is so wary of projects that come from nowhere that don't have a track record.  Some of the most successful community-projects that we've seen – like Bored Ape Yacht Club – have made far more money off of the secondary sales than they did with the primary sale because they did sustainable community-building to raise their perceived value to that level. They did that because they deliver.  So when you have these projects that are now valuable and started quite small, it's a bit presumptuous when a project that doesn't have that track record, sets its [mint] price quite high. And you wonder sometimes if those founders are acting in good faith and going to be as incentivized to work to create that value in the long term, especially given that there are a lot of scammers and rugpulls.  How do you feel about the fact that many NFT project founders choose to remain anonymous, which may seem odd to newcomers to NFTs or crypto in general?  When we're looking at projects, seeing that the founder is doxxed is obviously a reassuring factor because you know that they're not just going to drop off the face of the Earth. Anything they do is going to impact their reputation and not some projects. But NFT Now is a very anon-friendly publication. We never try to doxx anyone, we always want to protect people's identity so they feel comfortable.  Some people have different levels of comfort. There's some people we communicate over DMs or if they want to do an interview, maybe we'll do it over email. I think it's up to everyone to figure out where they feel comfortable.  For those who are newcomers to the space, it's just part of crypto culture that there are anonymous or pseudonymous figures in the space. Even the founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto – people don't know if it was a real person or a pseudonym as well. I think one thing that's really interesting, though, is that a focus on being able to build your own digital identity. It’s something that has always fascinated our society since the days of the cave paintings to Renaissance portraiture.  PFP projects are a natural extension of our desire to create digital identity. And what's interesting is now, we can actually own those digital identities. I think that on another level too, changing your profile picture to NFT or PFP, on some levels is a signal to the world that you're both literally and figuratively invested in this movement. I think that's why you see a lot of people rallying around these PFP communities. It's really fascinating that at the end of the day, whether we’re in Web 3, 2 or 1 – we're all humans. Psychology is still at play, but it's been fascinating to watch from a sociological perspective.  When you say it's a signal, you mean like a signal for cultural belonging, right? Not a signal as in financial flexing.  Yeah. Twitter is one of the purist segments of the NFT space and Instagram somewhat more like a tourist segment. I remember I had a PFP on my Twitter for a while and I was like, “You know what, I'm gonna make a conscious decision to switch on Instagram.” I knew a lot of people would be like, “What the hell is this?” and part of that was about creating that curiosity. Part of it was putting that in front of people, and people DMing me being, “What is a CryptoPunk?” and I was more than happy to help explain it to them.  Do you think these attitudes will eventually change?  I always say that we are the last generations to grow up without digital ownership from day one. Future generations aren't going to have the same hang ups as ours do, right? “When will I see [this NFT] on my wall, oh I will right click and save” – all that silliness. [People] are gonna accept [digital and physical ownership] for their own unique strengths and appeals. It's just going to be a normal part of everyone's experience.  I’m hoping, especially with NFT Now’s content, to show people that there's a lot more, that this genie is not going back inside the bottle. Digital ownership is going to become a cultural constant in the generations to come.  What we always try to do with NFT Now is zoom out a bit, show people the bigger picture and inspire people by showcasing some of these less heralded, but no less important, stories of empowerment.  But I get just as excited when I see more day to day on some stories of artists quitting their day jobs to be able to focus on art. Artists being able to – digital artists especially – make a living off of their own creative vision and not have to be reliant on a client. Seeing how photographers are going from a services economy to a proper goods economy and building, collecting that kind of stuff. … Seeing independent musicians make far more out of NFT drops than they could have ever made.  That's what really excites me – that's what gets me up in the morning – and that's what we're hoping to show people on NFT Now. We’re very much understanding that for many people, they may get in for PFP. They may get in by trying to flip something, and that's okay. We hope that they can also roll their ears, start to dig a little deeper, learn a bit more and realize that they shouldn't be missing the forest for the trees. This is going to be an absolute sea change in how creators and communities create value together.  NFTs are more than art, even though they’re only associated with digital art these days. NFTs can also be not-so-sexy stuff like property deeds or door locks. Don't you think we need to start making some clear distinctions and stop lumping them all as NFTs?  I think that this market and technology is still so nascent, and it is still so early from a market penetration perspective. Different use cases, categories, disciplines from art, collectibles, music, photography; and less sexy stuff like you said, like record keeping, land titles, government documents, healthcare, literary NFTs, membership passes. We are lumping them altogether just because they happen to share a medium, because they’re all NFTs.  What's important to note is that each of these different use cases have different creative and consumer priorities at play. I think one thing that's happening right now is because it's so new, because the space is so relatively small, and everyone's lumped together, there’s one town hall [instead of] 200 different town halls. I think what we're doing is a lot of people are applying the same expectations to different types of NFTs that they would never do in the traditional world. I always say it's like when you buy a painting, you're not necessarily expecting it to get you into a club, right? I think we have to be really cognizant of these different consumer priorities at play. Because what is right for a community-based collectible PFP project – to be able to create sustainable and improving value via a roadmap – is not not the same thing as a 1/1 artist or any photographer – we shouldn't be expecting the same things from them.  One of the most exciting things to me about the NFT space is how it empowers creators and creatives, to bypass gatekeepers and hierarchies that have long dominated industries.  I think, as these markets mature, we'll see each of these categories, these different areas, really kind of blossom in their own right and be accepted on their own terms. That doesn't mean that they won’t leverage the potential of this technology because there is a really cool opportunity when a piece of art can lead to membership in a community and certain utilities.  But we shouldn't expect that from everyone. We need to understand that each of these different art forms and creators have different creative priorities, and the people who are being attracted to them have different consumer priorities. A lot of people in the discourse are painting with a really broad brush. I think that's problematic because they also put pressure on artists to do stuff that aren't necessarily always natural to that. If it's an artist who is doing a genuine artistic expression – that isn't like a collectible project, this is a piece of art – the only utility that I expect out of it is that it makes me feel something.  How do you feel about institutions and brands aping into the NFT space? What advice would you have for them?  I think one of the most exciting things to me about the NFT space is how it empowers creators and creatives, to bypass gatekeepers and hierarchies that have long dominated industries. You've seen this in the art world where all of a sudden, major auction houses and the leading galleries have gone from literally getting to decide who gets to get seen, to scrambling to keep up and capitalize on artists and creatives who are already getting that audience and support, creating markets independently.  That's a trend we're going to continue to see, I think it's going to be something that revolutionizes the music industry, and so on. But, of course, power structures don't just disappear without a fight, right? There's a reason why you're seeing big brands, like Facebook becoming Meta [FB], coming in to do what they're gonna do. It's natural, but we have a real opportunity here to build a future, Web 3 and beyond – not just the same traditional hierarchies and inequities that we've largely seen.  Most of those hierarchies I'm referring to are largely male, white, and cisgender. There's a reason why the creatives who have been uplifted in those traditional power structures have often looked similar. I think that it would be an absolute shame if we do not, as a community, ensure that those same hierarchies and inequities are not just simply rebuilt in the metaverse if we don't trade one set of gatekeepers or another without actually ensuring meaningful diversity representation. That's something of paramount importance to me, to NFT Now, and I think it's a responsibility for builders in the space.  What I recommend for brands coming into the space… Well, I do think that the community is welcoming, but it is also quite discerning. It's gotten to the point where we can smell a cash grab from a mile away. I think what I said earlier about the importance of proving that you are here to create value, and not extract value, is very important.  If you just see the NFT space as a new revenue stream and planning for the short term, you're going to fail. I always say this like, an NFT sale is a beginning – it's not an ending – of a new connection with your community; it’s the beginning of a relationship. Earn the trust that you are creating with your community and with your customers. If you're playing for the short term, it's going to be very apparent and you're not going to have another chance in the long term.  So we're saying to brands entering the space – do it in a credible way, pay artists what they're worth. We’re leaving that whole climate of not crediting artists and paying them peanuts; we're leaving that in the past, but that doesn't bite. To pay artists their due, you have to give them recognition and you have to immediately engage the community. That's a lot more than a press release. It's gonna take real sustained time. And the brands that we've seen enter the space in the best way, they would put in the work and they did so in a credible way.

It’s the second consecutive month of bitcoin (BTC) sales for the confirmed bitcoin holder, as the company in March sold 200 bitcoins for $9.4 million.  The sales are just a modest fraction of Riot’s holdings, which stood at 6,320 bitcoins at of the end of April, up from 6,062 a month earlier.  “Riot is monitoring its balance sheet on an ongoing basis, evaluating the level of bitcoin retained from monthly production in consideration of operational and expansion cash requirements,” Trystine Payfer, Riot’s director of communications, said in an emailed statement to CoinDesk. “The company continues to hold a long-term view on its bitcoin holdings and believes it is in the best interest of shareholders to have strong bitcoin holdings on its balance sheet.”  Riot's mining operations produced 508 bitcoins in April, compared with 511 in March and 203 in April of 2021.  The company is likely bulking up its balance sheet amid continuing aggressive expansion plans. Most recently, the miner announced plans to develop a 1 gigawatt project in Navarro County, Texas. The company estimates the total cost of the first phase of the project at $333 million, which is scheduled to be invested over the next two years.  Riot is also developing a 400 megawatt infrastructure expansion project at its Whinstone facility in Rockdale, Texas.  In April, Riot filed for the sale of up to $500 million in shares from time to time, otherwise known as an “at-the-market” offering, proceeds of which may be used for investments in existing and future projects.

Although they&apos;re not without their share of problems, crypto-earning credit cards are an excellent solution to the slow mining process. In addition, they can be great additions to any cryptocurrency owner&apos;s arsenal of financial tools. Fees Using a cryptocurrency-earning credit card has advantages and disadvantages.

Lastly, it&apos;s important to understand the fees involved. While some crypto-earning credit cards do not charge deposit fees, others do. Depending on the provider, these can range from 3% to 7% or more. In addition, some crypto exchanges charge fees when you add funds to your account outside the credit card scenario. So while you don&apos;t have to worry about deposit fees for using a cryptocurrency credit card, you should be prepared to pay a fee for selling it.

As of Jan. 1, 2023, Uzbekistan residents will be able to buy or sell crypto only on the local exchanges, which must verify the identity of users through a know-your-customer process and store data about all the transactions for five years.

The agency, which will be funded by grants, donations and loans, will also create a regulatory sandbox for cryptocurrency projects. That will allow the projects to operate without a license and enjoy a favorable tax treatment for three years. After that, the projects should either become full-fledged regulated businesses or shut down. The agency's director will be assigned by the president.

42374809,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2lZv,1651585334,"Fed Meeting Decision Looks Baked, But Outlook Is Far From Certain","Seven weeks after the Federal Reserve raised the benchmark U.S. interest rate for the first time since 2018, the central bank is set to hold its third meeting of the year as monetary policy makers struggle to contain inflation.  The two-day, closed-door meeting is likely to contain few surprises, since Fed Chair Jerome Powell has already tipped the likely decision. But crypto traders and counterparts in traditional markets will be watching closely for clues on the central bank's future plans, with some economists now worried about the prospect of a recession at a time when consumer prices are already rising at their fastest pace in four decades.  Fed Chair Powell’s hints ahead of the meeting  Powell said during a panel discussion hosted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in April that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) – as the Fed's monetary-policy committee is known – was considering a 50 basis point (0.5 percentage point) rate hike in May; he said that the central bank is committed to raising rates “expeditiously.” This would be the first time in 22 years that the Fed raised its benchmark rate by half a point.  He also said that a 50 basis point rate hike not only in May but potentially in the upcoming months as well is preferred by several FOMC members.  As a result, bond-market traders are almost unanimously betting on a 50 basis point increase, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.  Minutes for the FOMC’s March meeting revealed that “many” members of the committee already wanted to go for a half percentage point hike in March but decided for a quarter-point hike partly because of the uncertainty associated with the war in Ukraine.  Likely more details on balance sheet reduction  The Federal Reserve is expected to announce more details on how it will reduce its $9 trillion balance sheet, which more than doubled in size during the pandemic.  While members of the FOMC have hinted at the pace and aggressiveness of shrinking the Fed’s holdings, analysts are still awaiting a definitive plan that would explain when the central bank will start the process, and how high it would set monthly caps for the runoff.  The last time the Fed reduced its balance sheet in 2017-19, it did so by about $50 billion per month, which is a much slower pace than the $95 billion that the FOMC said it would consider this time.  Strong labor market  While a strong labor market is good for the overall economy, low unemployment can be problematic when trying to bring inflation down, since there is extra upward pressure on wages; many companies then try to pass through those higher personnel costs by raising prices for consumer goods and services.  The labor market is currently near full employment, meaning that there are more job openings than people actively looking for employment. U.S. employment costs jumped by 4.5% the first quarter of 2022 versus a year earlier, the most in two decades.  “Powell will no doubt be asked about how the Fed views the recent strength of the labor market, particularly in the context of wage and price pressures,” economists at Deutsche Bank wrote in a report. “He is likely to continue to extol the considerable momentum in the economy, while reiterating that the degree of tightness in the labor market may be producing 'unhealthy' imbalances that are driving some of the momentum in inflation.”",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/03/fed-meeting-decision-looks-baked-but-outlook-is-far-from-certain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/355dde7d96e8335ba20048fb391121b501c9bd00-4735x3158.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Merghart was most recently venture partner at crypto fund Castle Island Ventures, a position he had held since June 2021 having previously been head of operations for Bitstamp. He had also spent a year as head of trading for Coinbase in 2018-19.  Millennium, which has over $53 billion in assets under management (AUM), has been eyeing expansion into the crypto market for some time. Last May, it was reported that the firm was standing up a crypto-focused trading fund and was hiring people for an operations team.  The hedge fund declined to comment on the report.

The BAYC cannot have members exceeding 10,000 because the collection has 10,000 such bored ape NFTs in different styles and appearances. Hence, it is understood that to be a member of this club, you should own at least one of these ape NFTs. These 10,000 NFTs represent a unique collectible built on the Ethereum blockchain.

Bloomberg first reported on the news.  Clearpool is a platform where institutions can access uncollateralized loans from a network of lenders. It is backed by investors including Arrington Capital, Sequoia Capital, Sino Global Capital and HashKey.  ""This is the first time that a major Wall Street institution has entered into a borrowing transaction on a DeFi protocol,"" Clearpool noted in its press release.  BlockTower general partner Sanat Rao told Bloomberg that DeFi protocols typically earn 15% to 25% in annualized interest, but declined to specify the rate BlockTower will receive from Jane Street.  Jane Street made its first DeFi investment last month, backing decentralized lending protocol, Bastion.  The New York firm also provides liquidity for Bitcoin and Ethereum on Robinhood and made its first crypto trade in 2017.  In January, Jane Street's Turner Batty described crypto trading as “a clear growth area” and that the number of people at Jane Street working on cryptocurrency has ""never been higher.""

42374812,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2lcR,1651584400,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Skew Shows Put Bias Intact; Focus on RSI,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin's put-call skews continue to exhibit fear of a deeper price drop. Cardano sees renewed accumulation by whales. Terra-based lending and borrowing protocol Anchor moves to dynamic earn rate.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Sergey Vasylchuk, founder and CEO, Everstake  Molly White, editor, Wikipedia  Market Moves  Fear reigns supreme in the crypto market as Federal Reserve (Fed) is set to kick off a two-day meeting later Tuesday that is likely to end with the central bank announcing an outsized 50 basis point (half percentage point) rate hike and plans to shrink its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.  Bitcoin's put-call skews, or implied volatility (vol) of calls minus puts, continue to hover above zero, indicating stronger demand for puts or bearish bets.  ""Put skew retains a strong bid,"" Adam Farthing, chief risk officer for Japan at crypto trading firm B2C2, wrote in a market update published Monday. ""Risk reversals [r/r] are better bid again for puts (25delta r/r for BTC and ETH at 7.0 and 9.0 respectively), reflecting both the oversupply of call side vol, and the general macro concern that further USD strength will correlate with higher generalized volatility.""  Data tracked by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew show the one-week, one, and three-month put-call skews continue to March higher. The six-month gauge has come off from 6% to 3% in recent days, perhaps a sign of renewed optimism about cryptocurrency's long-term prospects.  ""We're seeing consistent buying on late 2022/early 2023 options, which tells us that investors are feeling a little gloomy now, but hopeful for later in the year,"" Michael Safai, managing partner at crypto proprietary trading firm Dexterity Capital said in an email. ""Perhaps the expectation is, by then, the results of the Fed's rate experiment will be clear and macro sentiment will improve.""  Safai added that the upside momentum for bitcoin will need to come more from stock performance. The stock market's near-term prospects look bleak as expected tightening by the Fed is likely to cause demand destruction. The global manufacturing activity, measured by the Purchasing Manager's Index, has slipped into contraction, as The Daily Shot tweeted.  Per B2C2, crypto's dependence on equities looks elevated this week as the Fed, BoE, and RBA are scheduled to announce rate decisions. Further, the all-important U.S. nonfarm payrolls figure will be released this Friday. ""A big number could be interpreted as enabling Powell to hike more aggressively this year,"" B2C2's Farthing said.  Focus on 4H RSI  Traders looking for clues on whether bitcoin will bounce to $40,000 to drop to $37,000 should keep a close eye on bitcoin's 4-hour (4H) chart relative strength index (RSI). That's according to technical analysis by Nick Mancini, analyst at crypto sentiment analytics platform Trade the Chain.  ""Since mid-April, 4h BTC's RSI has been hovering beneath the current trend. It is currently testing the trend, but has yet to make up its mind,"" Mancini said in a weekly newsletter shared with CoinDesk on Monday. ""If RSI is rejected again, along with the sentiment, we would expect the price to drop to $37,000 (white box). If RSI breaks above the trend, then we would likely see $40,000 tested.""  Cardano whales accumulate  Cardano (ADA) addresses holding one million to 10 million ADA have increased their balance by 196 million coins in five weeks, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Sentiment.  The renewed accumulation by whales after a seven-month period might put a bid under the battered cryptocurrency.  ADA recently dipped to $0.735, the lowest since February 2021, according to CoinDesk data.  Anchor protocol shifts to dynamic earn rate  Terra-based lending and borrowing protocol Anchor is moving towards a flexible and dynamic deposit rate, abandoning the long-held policy of offering a fix rate of around 20%.  The rate will adjust dynamically by 1.5% each month depending on the changes in the protocol's yield reserves. The earn rate could increase if the reserve rises and vice versa.  ""The addition of a semi-dynamic Earn rate will contribute to the long-term sustainability of Anchor & will benefit users of the protocol by enabling yield reserve growth while continuing to provide an attractive yield on UST,"" DeFi content platform Stakingbits noted.

Syndicate co-founder Ian Lee said the additional $6 million was “an informal customers and strategic partners raise closed in a matter of weeks,” as opposed to a structured Series B. Think of it more like last year's community round, but “on steroids,” he said.  “In the three months since we’ve been live it’s been really crazy,” said Lee in an interview. “We’ve seen nearly 1,200 investment clubs as DAOs launched on Syndicate.

Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/QOTfvsZx/ The final target of this correction is around $11. At the moment, such a forecast looks quite scary and unrealistic. However, it is worth remembering that only a month ago the AXS price was about $73, and at the time of writing is $30. The main problem with this cryptocurrency is that there were no zones for accumulating positions and consolidating buyers on the way to the historical high of $155. The AXS price has long been growing without much volume. Therefore, the fall can be identically aggressive and lightning-fast.

These are the results that LINK sellers from November 2021 can boast of. The last achievement took place during the trading week on 25 April. The new year in the LINK market began with the breakthrough of the global growth trend and continues in the same vein. However, at the time of writing, there is some intrigue about the possibility of a price rebound. Why? The famous three updates of local LINK price lows took place on low volumes. What is interesting is that each subsequent attack of sellers was accompanied by smaller and smaller volumes. https://www.tradingview.com/x/ujSJbeWl/ The last update of the local low has barely taken place. Sellers have failed to break the consolidation wedge in which the LINK price has been falling since November. This means that buyers can expect a sweet rollback to the range of $14.67. This range is an important mark on the monthly timeframe. Just above the $14.67 mark, buyers managed to close each monthly candle from December 2021. Each except April. This fact may mean that the main demand of buyers at this level was met and it was not enough to buy all the sellers. So you should tune in to continue the downward trend with the final target of $7.

Each has an annual management fee of 50 basis points.  “Blockchain and the metaverse are two extraordinarily powerful trends that are set to dramatically change our society and how we do business,” Roy Ratnavel, CI GAM’s executive vice-president and head of distribution for CI GAM said. “Our ETFs provide investors with low-cost, convenient and diversified exposure to the growth potential of these rapidly developing, leading-edge sectors.”  These product launches expand CI and Galaxy’s initial ETF offerings listed in Toronto, including the CI Galaxy Multi-Crypto ETF, CI Galaxy Bitcoin Funds, and the CI Galaxy Ethereum Funds.

The downfall breaks under the 200-day EMA and shows a dip at the psychological barrier of $200. However, buyers lining up to buy the dip result in a bullish piercing candle. Source-Tradingview XMR Technical Analysis XMR coin price shows higher price rejection in the daily candle during the 90 points last fortnight, implying a formidable selling pressure. Hence, the recovery projects a higher likelihood of being a retest rather than a trend reversal point. Moreover, the lack of significant increase in trading volume questions the bull run possibility. The correction rally induces a bearish influence on the 50-day EMA, resulting in a falling trend and lowering the chances of the 100 and 200-day EMA bullish crossover. Moreover, the market price retests the merged EMAs with an evident higher price rejection. The RSI slope displays a minor reversal from the oversold zone, ready to approach the 14-day SMA.

With the additions, the number of staff dedicated to probing securities law violations in fields like coin offerings, lending, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) is 50.  Since 2017, the unit has brought more than 80 enforcement actions for fraudulent and unregistered offerings, with monetary relief totaling more than $2 billion.  SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has previously hit exchanges like Coinbase (COIN) for not registering with regulators when they offer security-like tokens. In September, he said the new area of responsibility would require ""a lot more people"" at the agency.  Recent SEC proposals have indicated it could extend enforcement action to DeFi, which poses new regulatory risks. There are also reports that the agency is looking into whether NFTs should fall under its responsibility.  The SEC polices those offering securities for sale, as well as those who advise on or broker trades, to make sure they are open and honest with clients.

42374804,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2lUt,1651566485,Here’s Why Solana Ceased Block Production for 7 Hours on Saturday,"Bots tied to a new non-fungible token (NFT) project built on Solana caused a seven-hour network outrage on Saturday, project developers confirmed in a post on Tuesday. No new blocks were produced by the network during that time.  Solana processes an average of 2,700 transactions per second (tps), blockchain explorers show, with an upper peak of over 710,000 tps on a standard network, as per developer documents.  However, on Saturday night millions of transactions flooded the network each second. This led to network validators – or entities that process transactions on and support the network – to run out of memory and crash, developers said.  “An enormous amount of inbound transactions (6 million per second) flooded the network, surpassing 100 Gbps of traffic at individual nodes,” developers wrote. “There is no evidence of a denial of service attack, but instead evidence indicates bots tried to programmatically win a new NFT being minted using the popular Candy Machine program.”  Validators ran out of memory while trying to clear up transactions in other, abandoned blocks. The number of total forks that validators had to evaluate exceeded their capacity to do so automatically, which led to a manual intervention to fix the issue.  Bots had swarmed the popular NFT minting tool known as Candy Machine on Saturday, as reported. This was mainly to take part in a new NFT project mint.  However, that mint used a fixed price for users instead of a Dutch auction – the usual process followed by crypto projects – which incentivized bots to send a huge number of transactions in hopes of winning the mint. This caused spam on the network.  Meanwhile, developers noted Solana has suffered intermittent congestion issues several times in the past months – with most of these resulting from bot activity targeted at NFT mints.  Changes are coming to combat those problems. Developers said the upcoming v1.10 release, currently stabilizing on testnet, includes memory use improvements to prolong the time nodes can endure slow or stalled consensus, which would help mitigate issues like those seen on Saturday.  Fees for prioritizing transactions are coming to Solana as well, developers added. This could help mitigate the entirety of Solana getting affected because of a single project.

Most comments were negative and critical, as reported, while the price of Crypto.com’s native CRO tokens fell by as much as 11% in the hours afterward.  Crypto.com has since backtracked on its decision to fully end staking rewards, where card users locked up CRO for a 180-day period to earn yields.  “Instead of eliminating card staking earn rates completely, we will offer a more balanced approach: 8% APY for Private Members (Obsidian, Icy White, and Frosted Rose Gold) 4% APY for Royal Indigo and Jade Green card holders,” Marszalek said in a tweet on Tuesday morning, referring annual percentage yield.  The rewards are still less than those offered now, with some users still expressing dismay.

VCs invested $23.5 billion in Indian startups in 2021, according to PitchBook data, creating 17 unicorns (companies valued at $1 billion or more) in the process.

New Bitcoin restrictions have piqued the curiosity of US government authorities and the Biden administration. People&apos;s interest in crypto has soared in the meantime: it&apos;s a hot topic not only among investors but also in popular culture, due to everyone from long-time investors to newbies like Elon Musk, who recently bought Twitter for $44 billion and that can mean a lot for the crypto space. Not only for Bitcoin but also Altcoins, 2021 was an important year. Investors are interested in Altcoins such as Ether, Solana, and Cardano, among others, for a variety of reasons, including faster transactions, lower costs, and a lower environmental impact. And even though the market is witnessing a marketwide correction now, it is only a matter of time until Bitcoin, and the other Altcoins make a comeback to hit new all-time highs.

Traders&apos; confidence in the asset has remained quite low considering the selling pressure in the market. The prices have currently plummeted owing to the news of the Federal Reserve hiking its interest rates. Bitcoin has also displayed profit booking on charts. This could be the reason why prices are falling further. If the asset fails to remain above the $38,000 price level, a short-term downslide could occur. Bitcoin is currently trading in bearish sentiment, however, charts have something else to say. Many bullish divergences were spotted on charts in different time frames. Bullish divergences amount to bullish sentiments. This means that over the long run Bitcoin can recover and trade above immediate resistances. Bitcoin Price Analysis: One Day Chart Bitcoin was trading at $38,956 at the time of writing. Immediate resistance for the coin stood at $40,000. A fall below the current price level would mean BTC would trade near the $38,000 price level. A fall from $38,000 could result in BTC trading at $31,000. In case there is a price reversal after breaking $40,000 then BTC could aim for $42,000. The volume of Bitcoin trading had dropped in the last trading sessions, however, the bars were seen in the green. This could mean that buying pressure was seen returning to the market.
