42422928,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1ymbh,1389116742,Can Hong Kong Lead the Way for Bitcoin Adoption Across China?,"Sixty-five years ago, history tells us the great question of American foreign policy was: who lost China?  In other words, who was responsible for the ""avoidable catastrophe"" that drove the Nationalists from the mainland and brought Mao Zedong to power?  Today, the question should be: what will China lose, if it attempts to resist global upheavals in finance and technology, culminating in the popularity and acceptance of Bitcoin as the ultimate form of digital, peer-to-peer currency?  The answer to that question will have a greater impact on the People's Bank of China (PBC) than its existing restrictions on the use of bitcoin. In my professional opinion, China will gradually (and quietly) ease its policy involving bitcoins – which is a smart hedge against inflation and a chance for the government, and millions of merchants, to prosper.  [post-quote]  I offer these words as an evaluation of China's internal politics, its emphasis on projecting power throughout Asia and abroad, as well as the cultural traditions – millennia of customs based on preserving personal prestige, or ""saving face"". Put simply, the government doesn't want to make elements of its opaque economy transparent.  To do so could risk a collapse in commercial real estate within China's mainland, or a precipitous drop in the value of the renminbi, or the withdrawal of foreign investment on an unprecedented scale.  But, and this point bears repeating because of economic reality and the necessity of diversification, China's leaders do not want to concede its influence to, say, Japan, South Korea or the United States.  In fact, the PBC's comments about bitcoin do not contain any intellectual arguments against the legitimacy or demand (by businesses and consumers) for this currency.  A careful parsing of the Bank's official statement, from 5th December 2013, reveals the politics of this decision, in which the central bank says their policy is to “safeguard the interests and property rights of the public, protect the legal standing of the renminbi, take precautions against the risk of money laundering and maintain financial stability.”  Two of these final three factors – the value of the renminbi and control or balance of the economy – have everything to do with the challenges China faces, not flaws in the credibility or use of bitcoin.  Gradual acceptance and order: the Hong Kong model  Before I address the concern about money laundering, allow me to prove my earlier assertion about the gradual acceptance of bitcoin within China. Indeed, as I write this column, news reports claim Robocoin plans to open its second bitcoin ATM in Hong Kong.  My interpretation of this announcement is simple: despite Hong Kong's status as a Special Administrative Region (""one country, two systems"") with its own independent judiciary, government and dollar, Hong Kong is, from the mainland's perspective, undeniably part of China.  Meaning: the gradual introduction and proliferation of bitcoin within Hong Kong, as a matter of course and as a symbol of the fluidity of how currencies physically circulate (an American dollar bill has a lifespan of 21 months, for example, traveling between 30 and 500 miles in nine months in the States, according to Gizmodo).  All of these factors will lead to the opening of more ATMs and the piercing of the ""Great Digital Wall of China,"" which separates the mainland from Hong Kong and the PBC from the virtual world of bitcoin.  Other points about the legal standing of the renminbi (which is not in jeopardy) and financial stability (which could weaken) are a separate matter.  I return, therefore, to my argument about the gradual acceptance of bitcoin by the mainland because, confronted with rapid change or full disclosure about the actual worth of the renminbi, there could be a run on China's banks and a series of economic shock waves – including the sale, by the PBC, of US Treasuries – resulting in global panic.  So, yes, the mainland has every reason to maintain order while discreetly buying bitcoins as a hedge against financial mayhem.  As for the threat of money laundering, which is an unfortunate phenomenon among all forms of currency, this crime is a far greater problem with fiat dollars than bitcoins. For purposes of comparison, the projected ceiling for the number of bitcoins is 21 million, while there are 107.74 trillion yuan (the primary unit of account for the renminbi) to cover cash in circulation and all deposits for the PBC.  To put things in further contrast, Global Financial Integrity estimates that $2.83 trillion flowed out of China illegally from 2005 to 2011. In a word, the complaint about bitcoin and money laundering is a sham.  If anything, the technology responsible for the mining and exchange of bitcoins is so sophisticated – and its security so encrypted and complex – it makes the production of fiat money look exactly like what it is: an antiquated system of metal plates, industrial printing presses, paper, cotton, linen and ink – to create 10,000 sheets of dollars for every two pallets, which make their way through the US Bureau of Engraving and Printing.  The choice is obvious, and the outcome is inevitable: China will loosen its restrictions on bitcoins. The government’s prudence and quiet diplomacy will allow bitcoin to gain acceptance within the mainland.  In doing so, we will speak of China’s great win, not the world’s loss.

42425248,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvfbh,1389114356,China's Answer to eBay Bans Sale of Bitcoins and Mining Gear,"Taobao, China's largest online marketplace, will ban the sale of all cryptocurrencies, mining equipment and mining tutorials from 14th Jan, it said in a statement released today.  A CoinDesk translation of the statement's major points is below:    Dear members:      In order to promote healthy development and ensure the interests of our members, some adjustments have been made in compliance with the government’s legal requirements. Our list of banned items will include bitcoin, litecoin and other virtual currency ... The adjustment will take effect starting on 14th Jan.    The statement specifies three categories of items, including a list of cryptocurrencies and related items:    1. Bitcoin, Litecoin, Beaocoin, Quarkcoins, Infinitecoin, Colossuscoin, CENT, PPCoin, Namecoin and other virtual currencies.      2. Tutorials on bitcoin mining.    3. Hardware and software that are used for mining bitcoin.    Following its release, the price of bitcoin on major Chinese exchanges experienced a slight drop from 5,600 yuan to 5,000 yuan, before rebounding to 5,300 yuan within half an hour.  Taobao, a consumer marketplace similar to eBay, claims more than half a billion registered users and daily transaction volumes exceeding 20bn yuan. The marketplace is currently one of the few places beyond the exchanges where users in China can buy bitcoin.  Taobao is owned by Alibaba Group, which also runs Alipay, China’s leading third-party online payment platform. The Chinese central bank last month banned financial institutions from dealing in bitcoin and barred payment companies from working with bitcoin exchanges. The move triggered a plunge in bitcoin prices.  Although Taobao's statement doesn't bar merchants on the marketplace from accepting bitcoin for goods and services, financial consultancy Kapronasia reported a drop in the number of merchants willing to take bitcoin payments in the wake of the central bank ruling, according to the South China Morning Post.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,Eric Mu,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/07/chinas-answer-to-ebay-bans-sale-of-bitcoins-and-mining-gear,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/39e28a2f9ff2910fa8aae8c91fd0080552cbd7dd-1084x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425239,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvfVh,1389110424,German Central Bank Official Issues Another Bitcoin Warning,"A German central bank official has issued another bitcoin warning, reiterating the bank's earlier position on digital currencies.  Last December, Bundesbank's President Jens Weidmann told Wirschaftswoche that bitcoin was not an alternative to national currencies and that bitcoins were only used as currency in certain niches.  Weidmann stressed that the driving factor behind the demand for bitcoin was the hope of big payouts, which may prove elusive for most investors.  On Monday, Bundesbank board member Carl-Ludwig Thiele told German financial magazine Handelsblatt that bitcoins remain highly speculative, as they are as volatile as ever.  He stressed that regulators and central bankers across Europe are discussing bitcoin and trying to raise public awareness, but so far no concrete action has been taken, apart from public warnings.  Thiele maintains that bitcoins are an exceptionally risky investment. “Because of its design and because of the large volatility, bitcoin [is] highly speculative,"" he said. “We do not see that the price is being driven by fundamentals.”  He also pointed out that bitcoin investors have absolutely no guarantee in case something goes wrong:  “There is not state guarantee for bitcoin and investors might lose all of their money. The Bundesbank is warning emphatically about these risks.”  Thiele added that bitcoins do not pose a threat to financial stability, due to their low volumes and amount of bitcoins in circulation. He said that about 70,000 bitcoin transactions take place worldwide each day, a figure dwarfed by the 59.8 million regular payments made in Germany each day.  However, although bitcoin does not pose a risk to financial stability, the same cannot be said of individual investors.  Thiele’s views are in line with previous statements made by Bundesbank officials and warnings issued by the European Banking Authority in December. However, it should be noted that Germany and most other European countries have a relatively liberal attitude towards digital currencies.  The big question is whether this is about to change, as Thiele points out that regulators and central bankers are starting to discuss bitcoin proliferation and, quite possibly, bitcoin regulation.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2014/01/07/german-central-bank-official-issues-another-bitcoin-warning,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88ab27e5468e3faf57d70bd1941c04a9c7e8d6c2-1000x665.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425246,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvfph,1389106811,North American Bitcoin Conference to Hit Miami on 25th January,"The bitcoin conference schedule is heating up for 2014. First up is the warm climate of Miami Beach. The North American Bitcoin Conference is being held there over the weekend of 25th-26th January.  The conference will be at the Miami Beach Convention Center. A networking event is scheduled for the Friday night before (24th January) at the Clevelander Hotel. That will be followed by two full days of bitcoin-centric speakers, learning sessions and product demos.  Moe Levin, who was managing coordinator of the Bitcoin EU Convention in Amsterdam last September, is running the Miami conference. He is forecasting a big turnout based on ticket sales.  “We expect 500-700 people,” he told CoinDesk.  Levin says that there will be a number of attendees traveling from Latin America to Miami because of its geographic proximity: “The conference being in Miami, there will be a lot of people coming from Latin America.”  It’s expected that a number of participants from the finance world will be coming to Miami as well, Levin explained: “I’m seeing financial investors coming in totally unrelated to bitcoin that just want to learn about it.""  Bitcoin-related startups were a very popular topic at the Inside Bitcoins conference in Las Vegas last month. Levin says that will also be a component of the North American Bitcoin Conference, along with a number of finance-related topics as well: “We will have a lot of financial speakers and we’re having a venture capital panel. But it’s also startups and developers as well. We have a panel for startups.”  There will also be a workshop hosted by BitPay to educate merchants about accepting bitcoin as a form of payment.  “We have a full day workshop for merchants to come to. It’s free for all merchants, it’s mostly for brick and mortar stores.""  The conference also has a mobile app called BTC Miami for both the Apple and Android mobile platforms. Users who install it are able to view the conference schedule, check in to events and network with bitcoin enthusiasts while at the conference.  There will also be a large number of exhibitors at the show promoting bitcoin-related products and service. And there’s still space available, according to Levin: “So far, we have 20 exhibitors showing their stuff.""  Full-conference and single-day conference tickets are still available on the official website.

42422925,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1ymXh,1389101142,Roger Ver and Erik Voorhees Back Bitcoin Wallet KryptoKit,"KryptoKit, the browser extension that allows users to send bitcoin payments and encrypted messaging in just a couple of clicks, today announced three big names from the bitcoin world would join the project ""in ownership roles"": Roger Ver, Erik Voorhees and Vitalik Buterin.  The move is sure to raise the profile of Toronto-based KryptoKit, which launched in Las Vegas last month. The browser plugin has a five-star user rating on the Google Chrome Web Store, but had been fairly low-key in its marketing tactics until recently.  All three names have worked on numerous bitcoin-related projects and have a personal interest in easy-to-use, private payment systems.  Pedigree  To many in the bitcoin community, these individuals need little introduction. Ver is known around the world for his serial entrepreneurship and bitcoin evangelism. He is CEO of MemoryDealers and has been involved with the Bitcoin Store, BitInstant and Blockchain.info. Ver has also acted as a seed investor on various other projects.  Buterin co-founded Bitcoin Magazine, where he is still a head writer. He has also been involved with bitcoin software projects including pybitcointools, multisig.info and the bitcoin private key secret-sharing utility btckeysplit.  Voorhees is another name long-associated with bitcoin. He is co-founder of Coinapult, a company which allows users to send bitcoins via SMS and email, and is planning to considerably expand its range of offerings.  Voorhees also founded gambling platform SatoshiDice; FeedZeBirds, a bitcoin-based Twitter advertising platform; and Paysius, a Bitcoin payment module.  The three will join co-founders Anthony Di Iorio and Steve Dakh. Di Iorio is Executive Director of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada and founder of the 400+ member Toronto Bitcoin Meetup group which meets weekly, as well as downtown Toronto co-working space Bitcoin Decentral.  He said he reached out to the three out of admiration for their work building communities and representing bitcoin on the international stage.  ""I have a lot of respect for those guys,"" Di Iorio said.  ""We already had all the funding we needed, but I respected their leadership capabilities and reached out to them. Roger and Erik are probably two of the top Bitcoin spokespeople in the world and will be working with us on business strategy and other areas.""  Simplicity and ease  KryptoKit promises a frictionless ""Simple Bitcoin and Secure Social Network"". There is no need to log in to any service: launched quickly from the browser toolbar, the compact window provides the user with a bitcoin address to load with spending funds and send with one click.  It also searches the page currently being browsed for bitcoin addresses and presents them as a list. Bitcoin data is accessed via the Blockchain.info API and all information is stored client-side, with no central server.  Centralized servers and remote data storage have been the downfall of other ill-fated web wallets in the past.  Another key feature is an encrypted message service based on GPG (GNU Privacy Guard). As with the bitcoin wallet, this is almost instantaneous to set up and use. Users may create new GPG keys or import an existing public-private pair.  KryptoKit also released a video this week demonstrating its ease of use with existing services, like Zynga's new bitcoin payment trial.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et3ucAZL0uk&noredirect=1  Buterin said he liked KryptoKit as the first in-browser bitcoin wallet that ""does it right."" He became interested in the project after writing an article on it for Bitcoin Magazine.  ""The ability to not enter any kind of personal information and simply pay in two clicks on the page was always one of the promises of bitcoin for me, and KryptoKit is the first application in my opinion to properly realize the promise.""  ""Also, I've always been attracted to encrypted messaging technology, and KryptoKit makes encrypted messaging much easier than any other software I've used; unlike tools like Enigmail and Gibberbot, I can actually see KryptoKit catching on simply because it's so much easier to use than many classes of non-encrypted messaging software.""  He promised more features to come soon, including more chat and messaging features that could turn KryptoKit into ""the world's first truly viable encrypted and semi-decentralized social network"".  While KryptoKit is Chrome-only for now, its developers have promised a Firefox version in the coming weeks with extensions for other browsers (eg: Safari) expected after that.

42425244,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvfjh,1389097815,"Who'd Have Known, Lily Allen Could Have Been a Bitcoin Millionaire","We have all heard stories of bitcoin-laden hardware buried in landfill, bitcoin pizzas which would have been worth millions today and other missed opportunities.  Singer Lily Allen apparently missed out on one such opportunity a few years ago.  Allen told the Telegraph that she could have earned more than £6m had she accepted a live gig on Second Life five years ago. She was offered “hundreds of thousands” of bitcoins for the gig and she turned it down.  “As if, I said.”  In Allen’s defence, it's hard to blame her for saying no. Most people are wary of bitcoin even today, when many mainstream businesses are starting to accept it.  Five years ago bitcoin was just a curiosity, relegated to experimental uses and payments for virtual goods in online games.  Missed opportunities  Allen is not alone. Last year it emerged that a 32-year-old New Yorker paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas from Papa John’s in 2010. Additionally, a British IT specialist accidentally binned a hard drive containing 7,500 bitcoins, which are now resting in somewhere in a Newport landfill.  Both incidents garnered a lot of publicity, but we can safely say that many people away from the media have regrets of their own – they just prefer not to talk about them.  We are, of course, talking about people who frequented online drug bazaars like Silk Road and Sheep Marketplace. They probably thought there were getting a good deal at the time, but in retrospect they were actually exchanging thousands of bitcoins for a cheap high.  We can only wonder how many traffickers made a handsome profit, provided they held on to some of their bitcoins, or if they were unable to access them because they were behind bars.  Who knows. Maybe there are a few crypto-millionaires serving lengthy prison sentences and planning how they will spend their bitcoin fortune once they get out.

42425240,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvfZh,1389092431,Indian Bitcoin Exchange Unocoin Back Online After Shutdown,"Bangalore-based bitcoin exchange Unocoin has come back online, announcing that it will begin trading bitcoins again on 8th January.  The return comes after a series of recent events in India that threatened a government crackdown on the country's fledgling bitcoin industry.  Unocoin  launched in mid-December at the Global Bitcoin Conference in Bangalore. The well-attended conference shone a light on India, and for a couple of weeks the country looked set to become Asia's next bitcoin star as China's crackdown began.  At the time, the company stated that financial regulatory compliance was a priority. It was open to Indian residents only and required Indian Personal Account Number (PAN) cards to set up an account.  Timeline of events  However, within weeks bitcoin's fortunes had reversed. On 24th December The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) joined other nations to issue a statement warning that exchanges were operating without regulatory approval. A number of exchanges suspended operations to play it safe.  Three days later, the situation intensified as authorities raided the premises of India's largest exchange Buysellbitco.in in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. The owners, however, were not charged with any crime.  On 27th December, Unocoin announced it would suspend buy-sell services and suspend user logins ""for the time being.""  Following this, tax officials also visited the offices of CoinMonk, a bitcoin education and mining company under the same umbrella as Unocoin. However, the interviews were mostly positive, used to gather information on CoinMonk's KYC compliance and technical details regarding bitcoin mining.  Statement  On 4th January, the newly-formed Bitcoins Alliance India (BAI), a bitcoin entrepreneur and advocacy group, held a press conference with international tax and corporate law expert Nishith Desai speaking on bitcoin's behalf.  Desai said the BAI ""welcomed"" the Reserve Bank's warning, adding that it was in line with other similar statements made internationally. However, he stressed that this did not mean bitcoin was or should be illegal.  Bitcoin is similar both to currency and securities, but is neither of those two things, the BAI statement continued: ""At best it is a combination of protocol, data, and software program stored at multiple locations.""  ""When transacted it involves some kind of bartering. If the bitcoins themselves are sold for a price in terms of ‘money’, Sale of Goods Act would apply but accepting bitcoins against goods should not attract the provisions of Sale of Goods Act.""  BAI also called on the government to recognize bitcoin's benefits and clarify its position:    ""Whether the bitcoins can be used for illegal trade is a question often asked. Yes, like any other cash it can be. But the cash is simply not traceable except by catching someone with physical possession. Bitcoins are far more traceable than money especially when traded through Bitcoin traders. BAI is committed to develop further standards of openness and transparency in collaboration with the regulators.      If properly harnessed, bitcoins in general have number of benefits:    1. Facilitates “financial inclusion” to the poor and unbanked population    2. Significantly reduces transaction costs    3. Enables the growth, ease and security of both ecommerce and physical transactions    BAI urges the government to clarify that the bitcoins are not illegal per se, however, they are saddled with number of commercial risks including its volatility, loss of hardware, digital wallet, etc.""    Unocoin announced it would restart operations after the conclusion of the press conference.

42425243,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvfhh,1389088851,Dutch Bitcoin Exchange Bitplaats Expands to Belgium,"Dutch bitcoin exchange Bitplaats has announced the expansion of its service into neighbouring country Belgium.  Belgian users can now trade digital currency from Bitplaats using the country's dominant online payments platform, Bancontact/Mister Cash.  Bitplaats  (which translates as 'bit place' in Dutch) claims transactions on its platform will be completed instantly as it uses the Bancontact/Mister Cash payment method, which offers transactions in real-time. Bancontact/Mister Cash is widely used for transactions in the country. Lennert Vlemmings, a Bitplaats co-founder, said:  ""We received many questions from people living in Belgium if they could use our service, so we started bitplaats.be with the Bancontact/Mister Cash payment option.""  The price of bitcoin when buying through Bitplaats is around 4% higher than the prevailing price on Bitstamp and about 6% lower than Mt. Gox.  What is Bancontact/Mister Cash?  Belgium's Bancontact/Mister Cash system is a national debit card system that's similar to the United Kingdom's Solo or China's UnionPay.  Funds are transacted between a merchant and a customer's bank account almost instantly. Bancontact/Mister Cash claims its transactions are completed in less than half a second and, notably, the system doesn't permit chargebacks.  Bitcoin users in Belgium generally obtain their digital currency through exchanges based overseas like Bitstamp and BTC-e, according to Chris D'Costa, who helped found the Belgian Bitcoin Association and is developing a hardware wallet called Meek.  Using these exchanges requires a registration process that can stretch over several days, and handing over personal identity documents, he said:  ""It's a reasonably difficult process for everybody currently: there's no easy way to get your bitcoins. The interesting development [with Bitplaats] is the ability to buy through Bancontact. It will be super easy to buy [bitcoin] over the counter here.""  The Bitplaats backstory  Bitplaats was launched in the Netherlands last April. It allowed users to buy and sell bitcoins using the iDEAL payment method, which is similar to Bancontact/Mister Cash.  Vlemmings said his firm had processed more than 3,500 transactions to date. He also claimed that Bitplaats had processed more than 150 transactions in Belgium in the two weeks that it has been active there.  Bitplaats doesn't impose a registration process on its users, nor does it require users to input any identification information to complete a transaction. Users can buy and sell bitcoin with the firm without entering an email address or username. Vlemmings added:  ""The big difference between us and an exchange like Mt. Gox or Bitstamp is that we deliver the bitcoins instantly, with no need for an account or registration documents.""  Vlemmings, 23, is one of four co-founders. He's based in the village of Lieshout in the south of the Netherlands. The group had been friends since high school, Vlemmings said, and got involved in the cryptocurrency last January.  Vlemmings had dabbled in bitcoin mining in 2011 while studying for his computer science degree at university, but he subsequently misplaced a hard drive containing 20 BTC when he lost interest in the digital currency.  Belgian bullishness  Bitcoin adoption in Belgium has been picking up speed over the last three months. A carrier called Mobile Vikings announced in December that it would start taking bitcoin payments for mobile credit in Belgium and the Netherlands. The country's top online food delivery site, Pizza.be, has also started taking orders in bitcoin.  On the regulatory front, Belgium appears to be relatively sanguine about bitcoin usage. Back in September, the nation's finance minister told parliament that the country's central bank should have no objection to bitcoin.  ""Even if you'd asked me a month ago, I'd have said not much is going on in Belgium. But now we're seeing some interesting developments,"" D'Costa said.  Correction: Bitplaats' premium to Bitstamp has been added and discount to Mt. Gox has been corrected.
