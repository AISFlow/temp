19476652,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557923,1698447644,The End Is Near For Trellor (TRB): Crypto Analyst Says Prepare For 50% Drop,"Trellor (TRB) has been one of the winners of the recent crypto market rally after going from a monthly low of $43 to over $115 in less than two weeks. This impressive rally has triggered heightened interest in the cryptocurrency leading to more momentum for the digital asset. However, not everyone is buying into this bullish fantasy as one crypto analyst has predicted a rapid decline in price for the digital asset. Why The Price Of Trellor Will Crash A TradingView crypto analyst has given reasons for why they see the Trellor (TRB) price crashing in the coming days. The post which included a chart of TRB depicted the price falling back down below the $60 mark once more. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Who Called Bitcoin’s Parabolic Rally Picks Altcoin Set To Pop According to the analyst, the first indicator of the coming crash is the fact that there has been a decline in the trading volume of TRB. They showed this in the chart, which showed that the volume drop is happening amid the price rally that the coin still seems to be undergoing. Also, the crypto analyst believes that this coin has now entered the “extremely overvalued and overbought” level. Now, usually when a coin is overvalued and overbought, it often precedes a crash in price as investors rush to secure profits. This could be what happens in this case, especially given the fact that the majority of holders are in heavy profits. Source: Tradingview.com The analyst points out that the TRB profitability is incredibly high, with 95% of holders in profit at the time that the analysis was posted. This is corroborated by data from IntoTheBlock, which showed a small drop in the number of profitable holders at 93% but with 0 holders in a loss. The remaining 7% are shown to be sitting at neutral which means they purchased their coins at the same prices as the current market price. This lends credence to the analyst’s expectation of a price decline, especially when these investors who are in profit begin to sell their coins. TRB still holding $110 | Source: TRBUSDT on Tradingview.com How Far Will The TRB Crash Go? When it comes to how far the crash can go, the crypto analyst sees an incredible drop in price coming. They believe that there is no way for the bulls to sustain the current momentum which has gone on for days “without heavy CORRECTION.” The analyst believes that the price of Trellor (TRB) will see at least 50% crash from the current level. However, the expectations are not given only for a crash. They explain that there is the possibility that the price will continue to go up, in which case it reaches as high as $135 to $155. But still maintain the expectation of a crash. Related Reading: Bitcoin Resumes Rally After Brief Hiatus, Here’s What Happened In a follow-up comment, the analyst revealed that they had decided to start shorting the TRB coin. Their price entry is shown to be $110 with three take profit targets set for $70, $52, and $41, and a stop loss placed at $161. The Trellor (TRB) coin, despite falling around $9 in the last day, is still up a significant amount. It is currently sitting at $111 at the time of writing, but its daily trading volume is down over 35% in the same time period.

19474577,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557949,1698444044,Binance Founder CZ’s Fortunes Plummet By $12 Billion Amidst Downturn in Crypto Trading,"Changpeng Zhao, widely known as CZ and the founder of Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has suffered a significant blow to his fortune. According to a recent Bloomberg report, CZ’s wealth plummeted by $12 billion due to the ongoing slump in crypto-trading activities. Per the report, this decline was primarily attributed to a sharp drop in trading volumes at Binance throughout the year. CZ’s Financial Losses The Bloomberg Billionaires Index revised its revenue estimates for Binance, slashing it by 38% after data revealed a decline in trading volumes at the exchange. As a result, CZ’s net worth now stands at $17.2 billion, marking a significant reduction from his previous valuation. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Team Member Clarifies SHIB Burn As Shibarium Grows According to Bloomberg, CZ’s involvement in recent events that led to the bankruptcy filing of FTX further impacted his financial situation. In November, CZ announced the liquidation of a token linked to FTX (FTT) after reports emerged that Alameda Research, the hedge fund owned by Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, held a large position in it. The announcement triggered a rush among FTX customers to withdraw funds, overwhelming the exchange’s infrastructure. As a consequence, FTX declared bankruptcy within a week, erasing Bankman-Fried’s fortune, which had peaked at $26 billion in March the previous year. To estimate Binance’s revenue, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index relies on spot and derivatives trading data from crypto-tracking services Coingecko and Coinpaprika. Binance had witnessed a significant gain in market share earlier this year, reaching 62% of total on-exchange crypto trades during the first quarter. However, after a promotional zero-fee period for popular trading pairs ended, Binance’s market share slid to 51% by the end of the third quarter, as reported by research firm CCData. Binance Value Plunges As Lawsuits And Allegations Take A Toll Binance has also faced increasing regulatory scrutiny, isolating itself from the traditional financial system. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Binance in June, accusing the exchange of violating regulations. Earlier this year, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also took legal action against Binance for non-compliance with rules that allowed US users to access the platform. Allegations against Binance include inadequate money-laundering controls, inflated trading volumes, and mishandling of client assets. Binance has strongly disputed these claims and is currently contesting them in court. Related Reading: Bitcoin Braces For $50 Billion Influx Following ETF Launch, Bitwise CEO Says In June, Bloomberg’s wealth index reduced the value of Binance’s US exchange to zero after it announced the discontinuation of dollar transactions, resulting in a significant decline in trading volumes. Binance.US had previously been valued at $4.7 billion during a funding round in March 2022, while CZ’s net worth peaked at $96 billion in January. The challenges faced by Binance are not unique, as regulatory uncertainties and rising interest rates have made alternative investments more appealing. Coinbase Global, another leading cryptocurrency exchange, experienced a 52% decline in spot trading volume in the third quarter compared to the previous year, according to Bloomberg. Despite the personal wealth challenges CZ faces, Binance Coin (BNB) has capitalized on the overall market recovery, showcasing substantial gains across various time frames. Currently, the token is trading at $225.2, maintaining its upward trend with a 2.2% increase over the past 24 hours. Furthermore, BNB has demonstrated significant gains of 5.8%, 9.6%, and 6.1% over the seven, fourteen, and thirty-day time frames, respectively. These positive trends highlight the token’s strong performance in recent weeks.

19472477,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557944,1698440444,Bitcoin’s Stellar Surge: What’s Next? Expert Deciphers The Crypto Labyrinth,"Gareth Soloway, an analyst and Chief Market Strategist at InTheMoneyStocks.com and President of VerifiedInvesting.com, has recently dived deep into the dynamics and offers a glimpse into Bitcoin and its future. Bitcoin’s rally, which boasts a 30% uptick in the past fortnight, has reignited the bullish sentiments within the crypto community. This performance has been linked to the anticipation surrounding the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-traded fund (ETF). What happens once this approval is granted? Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Rally: Analyst Sets $45,000 Target And It’s Closer Than You Think The Power Of Speculation And Potential Spot Bitcoin ETF Impact Gareth Soloway believes the approval, which might see daylight by the end of this year or early 2024, could trigger a price correction. “If Bitcoin is still up here, you may not go higher,” Soloway posits. Soloway argues that the crypto space might already be factoring in the spot Bitcoin ETF approval. This implies that the news, once official, might paradoxically catalyze a sell-off, dampening the current momentum. Soloway’s projection sees the “maximum upside” of Bitcoin in this bull phase reaching around $47,000 – potentially the next resistance level. The expert hints that many institutional ETF players might have pre-emptively accumulated Bitcoin, anticipating an eventual spot ETF approval. This could mean fewer buyers once the spot Bitcoin ETF comes to life. Soloway elucidated: Many of these ETF institutions have probably been accumulating for the last couple of months, knowing that eventually an approval will come. And so, there may not be as many buyers for the spot ETF. A Glimpse Into 2024: Economic Predictions And Crypto While Bitcoin’s immediate future is in the limelight, Soloway takes a broader macroeconomic stance for the coming year. The analyst paints a cautious picture, predicting an impending economic recession in 2024. This, coupled with a stock market correction of around 35%, might significantly impact Bitcoin. Soloway noted predicting a possible plunge to $15,000: What happens if the stock market goes down 35%? Fear and panic will take over, even in Bitcoin holders. Remember, there are a lot of people who hold Bitcoin that also have big stock portfolios. And if I’m down huge at some point, do I start to panic and start selling everything? That’s the worry that could drive us back to $15,000 or even lower. Backing his bleak economic prediction, Soloway further highlights soaring credit card debts, skyrocketing interest rates, and the “risky” state of several banking institutions. The expert stressed the lurking dangers within the banking sector, many of which he called “zombie banks,” operating with unsustainable “dead paper on their balance sheet.” Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Upcoming Leap?

Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Rally: Analyst Sets $45,000 Target And It’s Closer Than You Think As of this writing, BTC trades at $34,150 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency recorded a 15% profit the previous week and remains a top coin performer by market cap. Bitcoin On-Chain Activity Rises Hinting At A Bull Run? Data from the analytics platform mempool.space shows an increase in on-chain activity on the Bitcoin network. This spike occurred in February 2023, when BTC transactions rose above 50 Mega Virtual bytes (MvB). According to the analytics platform, the above metric measures the size of transactions and blocks on the BTC network. The larger the transaction, the more space they required. As seen in the chart below, each time there is a rise in the price of BTC, there is a surge of activity leading to the rally. This happened in 2017, and 2021, and it is happening this year, which suggests the ecosystem is blooming, onboarding more users, and preparing for a more significant rally like in the previous year. In addition to the increase in activity, it is possible to see the decline in the metric during the bear market and conclude bull markets record high activity. In contrast, the bear market records much less user activity, and they are generally cheaper to transact. However, unlike 2017 and 2021, this year, this ecosystem saw the implementation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and new applications boosting these metrics. Thus, it is harder to determine if the current rally can reach similar levels than in previous years as the BTC DeFi ecosystem attracts more users looking to leverage the network for utility rather than long-term investing. BTC DeFi Makes A Difference In Key BTC Metric? A Chat With The Team Behind “Leather” The surge in BTC on-chain activity could be attributed to the cyclical nature of the crypto market. When the price of BTC and others rise, or there is an expectation of further profits, more users on-board the network. As a result, the number of transactions recorded increases. However, many believe that with the implementation of NFTs in the BTC ecosystem, transaction activity can no longer be attributed to a new bullish cycle. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Blast Off In 18 Days, Here’s Why If so, rising activity metrics could become useless when measuring the sustainability of a BTC rally. To answer this question, we spoke with Mark Hendrickson, a General Manager at Trust Machines, a company working on a Bitcoin DeFi wallet. This is what he told us: What is “Leather,” and what is your goal in the Bitcoin ecosystem? A: Leather is a web3 wallets built around Bitcoin based technologies and applications. And so you can think of Leather, simply put as MetaMask for Bitcoin in the sense that we want to provide a robust user experience for connecting to applications built with Bitcoin and Bitcoin layers in which users can do a lot of the same sort of things that they can concurrently only do on smart contracts enabled L1 chains, but to do them actually on Bitcoin. So, Leather has the ability to connect the applications, identify yourself to those applications based on your Bitcoin addresses and your associated assets with those applications prompts for signed transactions that are essentially actions for those applications and to do so across layers. (…) We also want to facilitate the movement of liquidity between L1 and L2 (networks) and do so in a very seamless manner. A lot of people, for many reasons, are unfamiliar with the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. Can you tell us more about it, and what is Leather’s role in it? Also, what do you say to users who want Bitcoin to remain unchanged, the way it has been since its inception in 2009? A: Bitcoin based DeFi, I’d say is generally taking place these days or sort of emerging in two places. You have primitives for Bitcoin based divide on Bitcoin itself. That’s an L1 (Layer one), mostly driven by Ordinals and within Ordinals fungible token standards like BRC 20. And then you have also Bitcoin related taking place on Layer2 like Stacks that have smart contract functionality. (…) most of that’s taking place via Ordinals on the layers. It’s taking place mostly through the native smart contracting capabilities of those layers. To the question of people who want Bitcoin to remain unchanged, I think that the folks who are working on Bitcoin-related functionality, I’d say Bitcoin web3 in general, which includes DeFi. We’re trying actually to do more with Bitcoin without having to change Bitcoin really at all. So actually our general approach is to try to extend what you can do with Bitcoin without having to change it fundamentally because we do, of course, want to respect all the work that’s gone into Bitcoin to date and we’d love the security profile of Bitcoin. And that has to do with taking a relatively conservative approach. And so if you look at Ordinals, for example, which is really an innovation based on taproot introduced fairly recently, there’s a lot of innovation going on as a result of taproot ordinals without having really changed anything else about Bitcoin. It is a design space that is actually quite respectful of Bitcoin as blockchain. There is a theory that every bull run is preceded by an increase in on-chain activity, with fees following prices on their way to new highs. What do you think of network activity right now? Do you think much of it can now be attributed to Ordinals and other applications? A: Going back to the start of the year, Ordinals has been a huge exception to the general rule of the crypto bear market because we’ve experienced essentially two bull runs inside of Ordinals itself, which I think have boosted Bitcoin’s position and definitely has boosted network activity on Bitcoin and fee rates have gone up as a result of it. And really shown that this idea of storing data on chain on Bitcoin beyond just simple transactions and applying those primitives to various web3 applications, whether it’s art or whether it’s new token standards, that can have a huge effect on just how Bitcoin is used and also valued. (…) it’s hard for me to really pinpoint any given reason why any given month the Bitcoin may have gone up in price because of other factors, but it, it’s pretty clear that it has an overall effect (on network activity). Ordinals has been a positive influence on the interest in Bitcoin. ETFs, store of value, Gold 2.0, Halving, and now Bitcoin DeFi, what is the current narrative dominating the BTC market? And which narrative will gain more prominence in the long run? A: I think the dominant narrative around Bitcoin is probably that in the wake of the last crash, really it’s a spillover from last year. I think there are a lot of weaker technologies, weaker platforms and assets that were shaken out and people ran away from and they’ve taken more safe harbor and Bitcoin come back to Bitcoin as really the one that’s stood the test of time. So that combined with the fact that people, since the start of the year with Ordinals in particular have opened up to that there are more frontiers to what you can do with Bitcoin. I think that combination has really driven sort of a renewed enthusiasm around Bitcoin. It’s a combination of, it’s been around the longest, it’s the most secure, plus it’s not a dinosaur that can’t evolve still. It actually has a lot of potential. It actually has both of those qualities that are very attractive, secure and conservative in one way, but it’s also more innovative and there’s more potential than people had realized before on the other hand.

A number of large transactions have been flagged which suggests that these millionaire accounts are coming out to play. Litecoin On-Chain And Whale Activity Hit 4-Month High The Litecoin on-chain and whale activity has been on the rise recently, as reported by the on-chain analytics platform Santiment. In the report posted to X (formerly Twitter), Santiment revealed that there had been a big spike in the Litecoin on-chain activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Rally: Analyst Sets $45,000 Target And It’s Closer Than You Think The chart shared by the tracker showed the spike taking place in line with the price recovery, which would be the reason why investors are awakening once more. Santiment noted that this recovery in on-chain activity saw address activity on the blockchain, as well as whale activity reaching levels not seen since June, representing a 4-month high in this metric. A total of 319,000 daily addresses were active on the network after this metric dropped drastically in the last few months Additionally, weekly whale transactions, that is transactions carrying more than $100,000 rose and touched a new 4-month high of 7,418. These are not the only metrics that saw a spike as the dormant LTC address started seeing movement again. These addresses which had previously not seen movement for a while began to move coins around, adding to the current number of coins in circulation. LTC Ready For A Shoot To $100? The revival of on-chain activity for Litecoin is a welcome development for the network but it is not exactly bullish. The reason for this is how the LTC price has reacted since this activity commenced, which is not very encouraging. Related Reading: SEC Demands $700 Million Settlement From Ripple, Pro-XRP Lawyer Reveals Next Steps As the dormant LTC started to move once more, the price began to decline. This suggests that this subset of holders may be selling their coins after holding and waiting for better prices. In this case, the selling pressure has outweighed the demand for the coin. A continuation of this will likely see the price continue to fall further, and a recovery to $100 is still far off on the horizon. So this recent bout of activity may just be investors choosing to sell rather than coming back to participate in buying. The LTC price already fell from its $69 level on Thursday to as low as $67 on Friday before mounting a small recovery. Presently, the Litecoin price is sitting at $67.8, representing a 2.14% decrease in the last day.

According to a recent report by Messari, key metrics for NEAR Protocol surged significantly over the past month, buoyed by recent price increases across the crypto market. Surge In Transactions Drives Revenue Growth For NEAR Per the report, despite a moderate downturn in the crypto market, with XRP and Grayscale facing court rulings in their favor, NEAR Protocol showcased resilience. The total crypto market capitalization dipped by 5.8%, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) experiencing declines of 7.5% and 10.0% respectively. Within this context, NEAR’s circulating market capitalization decreased by 14% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) to $1.08 billion, while its fully diluted market capitalization decreased by 17% QoQ to $1.12 billion. Nevertheless, NEAR Protocol maintained its position as the 40th largest crypto protocol by market capitalization by the end of the quarter. One of the highlights in Q3 ’23 for the protocol was the revenue growth, which increased by 9% QoQ from $98,000 to $108,000. The average transaction fee remained at a low $0.001 throughout the quarter. Related Reading: FLOKI Outmuscles Top 100 Cryptos With 134% Price Explosion – Details Regarding network activity, NEAR recorded substantial growth in addresses during Q3 ’23. Active addresses increased by 350% QoQ, reaching 260,000 daily active addresses, while new addresses saw a 274% QoQ increase, totaling 51,000 daily new addresses. This growth was primarily fueled by the launch of KAIKAINOW, NEAR’s leading application, and supported by contributions from the Web3 health and fitness app, Sweat Economy, and Aurora, a solution that allows the execution of Ethereum contracts in a “more performant environment” in the NEAR ecosystem. TVL Drops To $52 Million In Q3 2023 According to Messari, NEAR’s Total Value Locked (TVL) experienced a 13% QoQ decrease, amounting to $52 million by the end of the quarter. NEAR ranked approximately 35th among blockchains in terms of TVL. Within the NEAR Network’s TVL, NEAR’s contribution accounted for $41 million (80%), while Aurora contributed $11 million (20%). Regarding DEX trading volume, NEAR reported an average daily volume of $1.3 million, maintaining stability compared to the previous quarter. NEAR ranked approximately 30th among DEX trading volumes. Related Reading: PEPE Price Leaps 90% As Meme Coin Reaches Over 155,000 On-Chain Wallets NEAR’s stablecoin market capitalization experienced a 27% QoQ decline, primarily driven by reductions in USDC and USDT. However, the native USDC was launched on NEAR during this period, while USN, the winding-down stablecoin from Decentral Bank, remained unchanged. NEAR Token’s Bullish Momentum Continues Regarding price action, as observed in the 1-day chart below, NEAR Protocol’s token, NEAR, has broken a prolonged downtrend that commenced on July 20 and concluded on August 18, leading to a phase of accumulation. However, on October 19, the token initiated an uptrend, resulting in significant gains of 12% over the last 30 days, 22% within the fourteen-day timeframe, and 22.3% in the past week. Presently, the token continues its rally, exhibiting a 2.6% surge in the past 24 hours, bringing the current trading price to $1.23. When considering the year-over-year period, the token remains significantly below its high in 2022, experiencing a decline of 60% over this duration. Furthermore, for NEAR to reclaim its 2023 yearly high, which stood at $2.83 and was achieved in April, the bullish momentum must persist. It remains to be seen whether the token can sustain its current bullish momentum and establish a new yearly high, capitalizing on the rallies witnessed by the largest cryptocurrencies in the market in the upcoming months to generate further profits.

BTC gained over 14% in a week, recently consolidating at around $33,700 after it hit fresh yearly highs at $35,000 but failed to break through that price level. Bitcoin's performance is roughly in line with the CoinDesk Market Index's [CMI] 14% advance.  Latest Analysis: Bitcoin Shows No Signs of Overheating, Despite Doubling This Year  The strongest pocket of digital assets was the CoinDesk Computing Sector [CPU] - an index that tracks protocols aiming to build and support the infrastructure of Web3 and distributed computing. CPU saw over 17% gains, driven mainly by tokens of Chainlink [LINK] and Fetch.AI [FET].  Even the laggard decentralized finance [DCF] and digitization [DTZ] sectors were up over 7% this week, highlighting the breadth of the crypto rally.  Notable best-performing cryptocurrencies include notorious meme coin pepe [PEPE] with 76% advance following a token burn, LINK rallying over 44% which benefitted from the tokenization of real-world assets trend and finance-focused Injective Protocol's native token [INJ], adding another 58% gain to its already-impressive run following a token upgrade this August.  Crypto's 'uptober' and big tech’s demise  What has made crypto's bullish week even more significant is the dismal performance of U.S. equities, Coinbase analysts David Duong and David Han noted.

""That massive divergence partly reflects a deteriorating macro trading environment juxtaposed against bitcoin’s positive idiosyncratic story,"" Duong and Han wrote.  ""Uptober is certainly living up to its name,"" Charlie Morris, founder of investment advisory firm ByteTree, said in a Friday market update.  Morris noted that the tech-heavy Nasdaq's slump amid BTC's and gold's advance signals a shift in the investment landscape away from the ever-growing, large U.S. tech giants.  ""Big tech is expensive, and following underwhelming results this week, the sector no longer grows fast enough to justify premium prices,"" he said.

With predictions of substantial inflows, industry experts are delving into the potential ramifications of such a development, exploring its capacity to transform the landscape of digital assets. Matt Hougan, the CEO of Bitwise, the world’s largest crypto index fund manager, shared his insights on the promising future of a spot BTC ETF, projecting a surge of around $50 billion within the first five years of its launch. Related Reading: PEPE Price Leaps 90% As Meme Coin Reaches Over 155,000 On-Chain Wallets The Potential Impact Of A Spot Bitcoin ETF The concept of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund centers around the idea of a fund that tracks the price of Bitcoin and can be traded on a stock exchange. This financial product allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without needing to directly own the cryptocurrency. The introduction of a spot BTC ETF is anticipated to pave the way for an influx of institutional and retail investors, catalyzing a significant flow of capital into the crypto market. Hougan’s projections foresee an impressive $5 billion inflow in the initial year alone, setting a solid foundation for the anticipated five-year influx of $50 billion. Considering the potential impact of a spot Bitcoin ETF, market analysts remain cautiously optimistic about its influence on the value of Bitcoin. While Hougan suggests an increase in demand for Bitcoin, the exact magnitude of this effect remains uncertain. The current market conditions, marked by a recent 1.1% dip in Bitcoin’s price following a week-long surge of 17.0%, underscore the sensitivity of the cryptocurrency market to external economic indicators. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Reverses December Downtrend – Good Days Ahead For Investors? Bitcoin slightly above the $34K level today. Chart: TradingView.com Inflation, Interest Rates, And The Crypto Market Amidst the anticipation surrounding the potential launch of a spot BTC ETF, the looming release of the United States Core Price Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) poses a significant concern for the crypto market. This widely watched inflation measure is closely monitored by the Federal Reserve, with expectations of a rise in the upcoming report. If the PCE data aligns with projections, the ramifications for the crypto market could be notably bearish. The potential for higher inflation to indicate a prolonged period of elevated interest rates could prompt a shift in investor sentiment, leading to a reduction in the allocation of funds towards riskier assets such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The perceived stability and security offered by traditional assets like Gold might lure investors away from the volatility of the crypto market, adding a layer of complexity to the already intricate dynamics of digital asset investments.

The filing comes a week after New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a separate lawsuit against Gemini, Genesis and DCG over allegedly defrauding more than 230,000 investors of more than $1 billion.  Both Gemini and Genesis found themselves in troubled waters in 2022 following the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX, which led to Genesis filing for bankruptcy in January.  In September, Genesis and DCG said that Gemini Earn customers would be made ""nearly whole"" under a proposed remuneration deal.  Genesis did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  On one other point, the Genesis and Gemini have strongly agreed: opposing accusations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that Earn was an unregistered security. In May, the companies asked a court to dismiss an SEC lawsuit targeting the program.

Shiba Inu Burn Process Demystified In a brief X (formerly Twitter) post on Thursday, Lucie, a popular Shiba Inu marketer provided a detailed guideline on how SHIB users and investors should burn their SHIB tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Rally: Analyst Sets $45,000 Target And It’s Closer Than You Think Lucie stated that before sending the SHIB token into a dead wallet, users should bridge the SHIB token back to the Ethereum network first. “To ensure the proper process, if you are a part of the Shibarium project and wish to burn Shib, please make sure to bridge your Shib back to the Ethereum network and then send it to the dead wallet,” Lucie stated. She stressed the importance of this initial step, stating that bridging the SHIB token first on Ethereum before burning it on Shibarium, allows the original SHIB to be locked in the bridge contract while a minted version of the SHIB token is sent to Shibarium to be burnt. “When you initially bridge your SHIB to Shibarium, the original Shib tokens are locked in the bridge contract, while a version of the token is minted on Shibarium. This means that when you decide to burn your Shib on Shibarium, you are actually burning the minted version, while the original tokens remain locked in the bridge contract,” Lucie explained. Presently, Shib burn rates have been increasing as the Shibarium layer 2 network keeps growing. According to Shibburn, Shib burn rates are up 193.46% in the last 24 hours and continue to rise. There have also been approximately 56,436,887 SHIB tokens burned at the time of writing. SHIB bulls hold steady | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com Shibarium Surges 493% In Transactions Shibarium, an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain network for Shiba Inu, has recently experienced a staggering increase in transactions. The Shibarium network recorded a 493% upsurge in transactions sometime on October 26.

42392167,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2EYZ,1698421863,Crypto Miners Lobby U.S. Lawmakers to Counter Environmental 'Misunderstanding',"When crypto mining is discussed in the U.S. Congress, it's often tied to claims that mining operations are environmental parasites, sapping finite energy resources. But representatives of that sector flooded offices on Capitol Hill this week to argue their businesses can help stabilize the power grid, tie into renewable resources and foster domestic technology.  Executives representing more than 40 mining operations and their lobbyists hit dozens of offices in the House of Representatives on Thursday, focusing on members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  ""The core message that we're delivering to congressional offices today is that bitcoin mining is helping achieve and advance America's energy security and national security,"" said Perianne Boring, CEO of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, which organized the Digital Power Network that conducted the lobbying event.  Last year, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) led other lawmakers on a probe of crypto's effects on the vulnerable Texas energy grid. Warren and environmental groups have criticized the sector's high energy use as a threat to the global climate.  ""We have seen a lot of misunderstanding about bitcoin mining and energy policy,"" Boring said, adding that the companies in their House meetings shared real-world examples of the technology becoming part of the U.S. energy infrastructure.  ""The negative impact of the energy usage debate wasn't as pronounced as I had anticipated,"" Galaxy Digital's former head of mining Amanda Fabiano, who is now an industry consultant and participated in the event, said in a posting on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). She noted that the arguments that resonated with lawmakers included the jobs mining creates and the advancement of U.S. innovation.  Sanjay Gupta, head of strategy at Auradine, a Silicon Valley tech company, focused a lot of his discussions on restrictions and import tariffs on Chinese technologies in the space. He said the U.S. already limits ""access of sensitive high technology to Chinese companies,"" but his company's priority was ""to ensure that that's enforced."" Reports of China-tied crypto facilities in the U.S. have raised some alarms.  Boring said the industry is also supporting a bill from Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.) that would establish the House sees proof-of-work bitcoin mining as beneficial.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] move higher came as technology stocks continued their decline despite a number of mega-cap names – Amazon, Google and Facebook among them – reporting better-than-hoped earnings results. The Nasdaq Composite is now lower by more than 10% from its July high, putting the tech-heavy index in correction territory.  This is notable as bitcoin in the past has shown a strong correlation with U.S. equity markets, but now appears to be decoupling. The largest cryptocurrency is currently posting more than a 100% gain year-to-date, with options activity reaching historic highs.  Bitcoin’s market capitalization of about $670 billion is now roughly on par with Elon Musk's electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA) and tops that of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (LLY).  Were it a U.S.-listed stock, bitcoin would rank as the ninth-largest by market cap, just behind that of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett, data from CompaniesMarketCap shows.  Traders have mixed opinions ahead of FOMC  Meanwhile, traders remain cautious about an extended price surge in the weeks ahead, pointing to the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for next Tuesday and Wednesday.  “The market’s atmosphere could drastically change,” analysts at Japanese exchange Bitbank shared in a note with CoinDesk. “Recent economic data have demonstrated the U.S. economy’s strength, so a likely scenario is that the Fed will keep its policy rate unchanged but chair Powell will try to counter market’s expectation that rate hikes are over at his press conference.”  “This is why bitcoin’s potential significant upside risk has a short expiration date: it could print another leg up in the next couple of days and then enter a correction phase, or it could stay at the current level until next week’s FOMC and then start to pull back,” continued the analysts, led by Yukari Kusu.  FxPro market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich, however, gave a differing view of FOMC expectations in a Friday note to CoinDesk.  “The crypto market is holding its total capitalization above $1.27 trillion despite a frightening sell-off in equities overnight,” Kuptsikevich said. “Bitcoin and other major altcoins are once again attempting to play the role of safe haven.”  “There is also possible speculation that market turbulence in the week leading up to the FOMC meeting will force the regulator to soften its tone significantly, which is positive for crypto unaffected by the falling revenues from Google's cloud business or similar stories,” he continued.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/27/bitcoin-catches-market-cap-of-elon-musks-tesla-amid-etf-fueled-rally-but-traders-cautious-ahead-of-fed-meeting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/488b789a9bea677f0a3b5a88d064872bb9f857ae-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19459741,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557910,1698418826,"XRP Price To Go Parabolic, Here’s When","On Wednesday, October 25, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst Dark Defender revealed that the price of XRP will go parabolic in the future, highlighting how it is going to happen and when it is expected to happen. Crypto Analyst’s XRP Price Projection The XRP analyst recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his predictions and optimism on the XRP price going parabolic and how it is going to happen. In the Dark Defender X post, there are two crucial support levels and three resistance levels for the digital asset, which include $0.52 and $0.46 for the support levels, while the resistance levels are $0.66, $1.88, and $5.85. According to him, the XRP price could be on its way to surpass the $1 mark if it manages to break through the $0.66 resistance level. And when this happens, the next resistance level will be $1.88. The analyst’s recent projection presents a 210.64% price surge if the XRP price breaks through the $1.88 resistance level, which will see the cryptocurrency potentially heading toward the coveted $6 mark. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Surge Amid Heightened Whale Accumulation One interesting thing about the analyst projections is the fact that his projections are based on an examination of the XRP’s weekly market trajectory over the past two years. According to the chart posted by Dark Defender, the trends that were evident prior to the July surge seem to be resurfacing, suggesting a potential bullish run for XRP between 2024 and 2025. So far, the XRP analyst is not the only one who believes in a potential price for XRP. Several other experts have shown increased credence about the XRP’s potential price surge this year. In September, Wells Fargo manager Shannon Thorp predicted the price of XRP could go as high as $500, presenting a bullish concept for the cryptocurrency. Another prominent figure in the crypto space who has expressed his optimism about the XRP price potential is CryptoInsight, drawing comparisons to the Bitcoin fractal from 2017. This is because the question that has been swelling among the crypto community is whether XRP will mirror the 2017 Bitcoin fractal in the coming weeks. Leaving the result open-ended, he speculated that there is a possibility that XRP will outperform following a five-year period of consolidation. According to CryptoInsight, this is because most of the cryptocurrencies now basically began their bull market after surpassing their previous peak, but the XRP seems to have plummeted due to the SEC’s lawsuit on Ripple being dropped. However, a recent rally has shown a significant 13% surge in the price of XRP over the past week, with a trading volume of $2.3 billion. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.55 as of the time of writing.

42392171,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2Et5,1698416330,What’s the Deal With Sam Bankman-Fried’s ‘Advice of Counsel’ Defense,"Yesterday, Sam Bankman-Fried took the stand at his monumental criminal trial, but not for the benefit of the jury. Instead, in a marathon session, SBF took the stand and gave New York District Judge Lewis Kaplan a dry run of what certain — let’s call it controversial — testimony could sound like in court.  Over the past few weeks, Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyers have been lambasted by onlookers and the presiding judge for what looks like an incongruous or inarticulate defense strategy in face of the stronger narrative of SBF’s multi-year scheme to defraud FTX’s users and investors. That’s largely for two reasons: most importantly, up until Thursday, we were in “the prosecution’s case,” meaning it was attorneys for the U.S. Department of Justice looking to convict SBF who scheduled the witnesses and largely ran the narrative.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Nothing even says SBF’s defense counsel needs to “bring a defense,” if they feel the U.S. attorneys haven’t convincingly made their case. But SBF wanted to testify, for any number of myriad personal and philosophical hangups. So the defense is “bringing a defense,” but not exactly the one they really would have liked to. Before the trial started, we heard much of SBF’s strategy would be rolled up into two basic arguments: blaming his ex-girlfriend, Caroline Ellison, and blaming his ex-lawyers.  The so-called advice-of-counsel defense is a well-established legal routine that tries to cast doubt in a defendant's culpability by spreading fault to people who were advising him, and should have known better.  DOJ lawyers, however, have long argued this strategy is besides the point, and have filed numerous documents in the case saying SBF’s lawyers should be prohibited from making it, in part because it might distract the jury from the actual crime. You know, the $8 billion embezzlement scheme SBF has been accused of. By and large, Kaplan has been partial to the prosecution here, and even prevented SBF’s counsel from bringing up his lawyers’ possible complicity in opening statements and permitting Can Sun, former general counsel at FTX, to testify under a non-prosecution agreement.  On Thursday, Kaplan was trying to work out how much of this argument SBF’s lawyers can coax out of him on the stand, saying both sides have submitted lengthy filings that he hadn’t made up his mind on. Not only could an advice-of-counsel argument mislead jurors, but in many cases it often requires more formal legwork in trying to establish timelines and dig up legal documents than SBF’s lawyers seem to have put in.  SBF’s lawyers, instead, argue they are looking to present a sort of abridged advice of counsel defense. They asked him questions about the auto-deleting Signal messaging settings SBF asked his underlings to use as well as the payment agreement between Alameda Research and FTX, which SBF’s lawyers were supposed to privy to to make the case that everything was above board even as SBF directed staff to drain customer funds from his exchange.  The prosecution says this is just as misleading as a traditional advice-of-counsel defense, and a way to slip in a legal theory they cannot truly support. Take the so-called “transfer agent agreement” document brought up in SBF’s testimony, which his lawyers could have subpoenaed from the FTX estate, but didn’t. So instead, SBF, described as being flushed at times, rambly and having trouble drinking water, testified about what he “believed” and “remembered” to be the case about some seemingly critical document that no one – judge, jury or executioner — has seen.  And so, Kaplan, as is his right, will decide this morning what if any of SBF’s testimony about the advice his lawyers gave him can become an official part of his defense. Whether allowed or not, SBF is fighting an uphill battle. As Kaplan himself asked defense after SBF’s testimony, looking for their input on why this should all go before a jury: Isn’t this a matter of a thief stealing money and asking lawyers to draft up documents allowing him to spend it?",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/27/whats-the-deal-with-sam-bankman-frieds-advice-of-counsel-defense,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e471c758e0da883e65b626a5ab9c08771d8cf949-1330x1374.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

FLOKI, a cryptocurrency that draws inspiration from Elon Musk and derives its name from his Shiba Inu companion Floki, has exhibited a notable surge in value, with a 26% price appreciation observed over the course of the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, FLOKI was trading at $0.000038, and registered a commanding 134% increase in the last seven days, surpassing today’s top 100 roster of cryptocurrencies, according to data by crypto market tracker Coingecko. The recent increase in value aligns with the forthcoming introduction of FLOKI’s eagerly awaited staking initiative scheduled for October 27, 2023. We will be launching the $FLOKI staking program on the 27th of October, 2023. To ensure a sustainable staking program, we will also be launching a sister token that #Floki stakers will earn as rewards. This token is a utility token that targets an industry with trillion dollar… pic.twitter.com/VRWJKUFeLd — FLOKI (@RealFlokiInu) October 25, 2023 Related Reading: PEPE Price Leaps 90% As Meme Coin Reaches Over 155,000 On-Chain Wallets The Role Of Staking In Cryptocurrency Many people in the cryptocurrency industry and among FLOKI’s investment base are looking forward to the next staking project. Staking is a key component of blockchain technology, enabling cryptocurrency holders to support network security and maintenance while earning rewards by locking up their assets. This active participation benefits both the blockchain’s stability and stakers, who receive passive income in the form of new tokens or transaction fees. Staking encourages long-term commitment and community engagement in the cryptocurrency space. FLOKI’s recent 26% single-day price spike enabled the meme coin to tally a high not seen in several months and entering a price range between $0.00003235 and $0.00003500. To keep this positive trend going, the meme coin needs to surpass the $0.00003368 mark. If it manages to do so, it might continue climbing and reach the $0.00003501 mark, or in a very optimistic scenario, even go up to $0.00004000.

FLOKIUSDT currently trading at $0.00003901 on the daily chart: TradingView.com The Hype Around FLOKI Staking Launch The staking launch offers FLOKI holders an opportunity to accrue further FLOKI incentives solely by retaining ownership of the token. It is not surprising that FLOKI prices have experienced a significant increase in value due to the anticipation around its upcoming introduction. The forthcoming launch event will additionally provide pertinent information regarding its affiliated digital asset, TokenFi, denoted by the ticker symbol $TOKEN. Consequently, this development is expected to generate significant anticipation for the aforementioned meme token, leading to a substantial increase in its market value. Meanwhile, Coincodex forecasts that by October 27 the price of Floki Inu will have dropped by 7.26 percent, to USD 0.00002352. The Fear & Greed index is currently at 53, which is neutral despite the bullish signals from the technical indicators. Based on Floki Inu’s past price patterns, we can estimate that it will be worth as little as 0.00002205 USD in 2024, and as much as 0.00005826 USD in 2025.

By my own estimates, I think Q3 is going to look a little rough. But I think the worst is likely over. The company is paying down debt while it grows production capacity and BTC on the balance sheet. Expansion in Paraguay is a safer bet than Argentina. With renewed enthusiasm about a potential spot Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETF approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, BTC has propelled to $35k this month. Higher coin prices generally equate to improving mining economics and profitability is finally starting to look a little better. Mining Profitability (BitInfoCharts) Mining profitability surged to a two-month high on October 25th but you'd never know it by looking at the mining stocks. With the caveat that miners are still up substantially year to date, most of the BTC mining stocks have generally lagged Bitcoin's price performance in recent weeks and months: Miners vs BTC (Seeking Alpha) One such miner that has lagged recently is Bitfarms (BITF). I've covered BITF a couple of times in the past for Seeking Alpha and as fate would have it, the stock is essentially right back where it was during each of my previous buy calls. Given the recent run in Bitcoin, I'd like to provide readers with some additional thoughts on Bitfarms and give my expectations for the company's upcoming earnings report on November 7th . Production & Efficiency For the month of September, Bitfarms mined 411 BTC on 6.1 EH/s. This followed 383 BTC mined in August and 378 BTC in July. Taking the company's BTC haul and dividing it by the EH/s can provide a meaningful efficiency measurement that allows for a fairly decent apples-to-apples comparison. Here's that trend as of September: Mining Efficiency (Compass Mining/Anthony Power) Most miners spent much of the summer in the 70s from a BTC per EH/s standpoint. Year to date, Bifarms has been the industry standout. This is a testament to the company's fleet efficiency and the fact that Bitfarms has been at or near the top of the rankings in this metric all year is a great sign. Like most of the other miners, Bitfarms takes a hybrid approach to balance sheet management as it sells some of its monthly production to cover costs and keeps the rest: BTC Treasuries December 2022 September 2023 Change Change % Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) 6,952 7,327 375 5.39% Marathon Digital ( MARA ) 12,232 13,726 1,494 12.21% Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) 9,086 9,366 280 3.08% Bitfarms 405 703 298 73.58% CleanSpark ( CLSK ) 228 2,240 2,012 882.46% Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) 394 553 159 40.36% Source: Company filings Year to date, the company has grown BTC liquidity by 298 coins. Nominally, there have been other miners that have grown stacks to a larger degree but Bifarms has been able to grow its holdings by almost 74% year to date even while aggressively paying down debt in recent quarters. Balance Sheet & Q3 Expectations It's been a rough Crypto Winter for Bitfarms. After amassing over 6,000 BTC in treasury in May 2022, each crypto collapse saw more BTC leaving the company's control. At one point in 2022, Bitfarms had over $142 million in current liabilities. However, the company is now in a much better position than it was at the beginning of the year. September Update (Bitfarms) As of the end of September, Bitfarms has just $9.9 million in debt remaining, along with $46 million in cash. The Q3 earnings report will show $19 million in BTC but adjusting the September holdings for current pricing, that bitcoin stash is now worth closer to $24 million. Importantly, Bitfarms' debt will mature by the end of February which will help alleviate the cash flow hit following the block reward reduction in April. Looking at upcoming earnings, I think it's a fair bet that the company will have another sizeable net loss in Q3. July, August, and September were disappointing months for Bitcoin and Bitfarms' revenue from BTC sales during those months came in at $28.4 million per the company's monthly production updates: Q3-22 Q4-22 Q1-23 Q2-23 Q3-23 Global Network hash 213 255 290 358 400* Avg EH/s 3.9 4.4 4.7 5.1 5.7 Revenue $33.2 $27.0 $30.1 $35.5 $28.4 Cost of Revenue $37.2 $39.1 $38.4 $41.5 $44.6* Total Opex $10.3 $12.0 $8.4 $12.2 $12.2* Operating Income -$14.3 -$24.1 -$16.7 -$18.2 -$28.4* Sources: Seeking Alpha, Bitfarms, *author's estimate In the table above, I'm using 400 as the global network hash rate, I'm carrying over opex from Q2 and assuming similar energy expense and depreciation ratios to the first half of the year. Based on those assumptions, I get $44.6 million in cost of revenue and -$28.4 million in operating income. Here's the good news, higher prices fix this and that's exactly what we have in October. At $34k BTC, the 1,018 bitcoin that Bitfarms sold in Q3 would have generated $34.6 million in revenue and the 154 BTC that were kept in treasury equate to another $5.2 million. That still isn't enough to make Bitfarms gross profitable but it's much closer. And if you're of the opinion, as I am, that Bitcoin will surpass $100k per coin in the next bull run, then Bitfarms will be profitable even adjusting for the halving. But again, these are estimates and forecasts that may not come to fruition. This is a high-risk space and these stocks generally have a poor history as long-term investments. Geographic Mix & Expansion Plans The company has a fairly well-diversified production footprint that spreads its 240 MW out over a total of eleven farms located in four different countries. At the end of September, Bitfarms was actively hashing in Canada, Paraguay, Argentina, and the United States. September Update (Bitfarms) Something that has complicated Bitfarms' expansion plans has been the volatile financial and political environment in Argentina. The company had previously planned to expand beyond a single 50 MW warehouse in that country but has since decided to grow operations in Paraguay instead. Bitfarms leadership has noted how Argentina became a more difficult jurisdiction to do business in following changes to direct importation last year. Looking ahead, the potential instability from a change in government is also something Bitfarms leadership has been mindful of. October 22 Results (Reuters) The general election that took place on October 22nd will be followed by a run-off vote in November between Sergio Massa and Javier Milei. On the Q2 conference call, Bitfarms leadership touched on the election briefly but didn't overtly disclose a candidate's preference. However, there was an acknowledgement that financial policies differ between the candidates and Argentina has a substantially negative dollar reserve balance: the country has to address this, that can introduce uncertainties similar to what we saw and the pain that we experienced obviously last year. So we want to make sure that we're looking at great opportunities Reading between the lines, it appears as though pro-Bitcoin anarcho-capitalist independent Javier Milei could be the desired candidate from the perspective of Bitfarms. But in any case, expanding in Argentina is seemingly a bigger gamble than Paraguay at this point in time and the company purchased 150 MW in hydropower PPAs between Paso Pe and Yguazu in July. September Update (Bitfarms) Official guidance is for 7.0 EH/s by the end of March 2024 but President and CEO Geoff Morphy left the door open for 7.8 EH/s possibly early next year if additional growth prospects fall into place. In August, Bitfarms purchased just under 3k new rigs with cash and miner credits. Risks I think just about every serious 'bitcoiner' is aware at this point, but I'll mention once again; that we have a block reward halving coming in April. That event will essentially cut revenue from mining in half overnight. This a major concern for every public Bitcoin miner and may position these companies as better trading vehicles than actual investments for the time being. Like most miners, dilution is a concern for Bifarms. The company has raised at least $48 million through its ATM over the last two quarters. Furthermore, transaction fees as a percentage of the block reward haven't lived up to the potential that we saw back in May with the emergence of Ordinals and BRC-20 token swaps. Until transaction fees become a more reliable driver of miner revenue, halvings will be a perpetual ""reset"" of the mining market that will almost certainly result in consolidation and exits as weak miners turn off. More specifically to Bitfarms, I think jurisdiction risk in Argentina is something to consider since the country is home to 21% of the company's BTC production. It's difficult to forecast how the upcoming election might play out but the country is dealing with astronomical inflation and any social unrest could ultimately lead to political risk. Summary As we approach the halving, I'm personally planning to hold a small list of about five BTC mining stocks that I like above the two dozen or so names in the sector. Bitfarms is one of the stocks on that list. At a time when we've seen at least a half dozen BTC mining names pivot to ""AI"" or HPC services to some degree, I think there is something to be said about the companies that are sticking with core competencies and entering the halving with sound balance sheets. As I said in my recent Hut 8 Mining article , I think we've seen the cycle bottom for BTC and I believe miner shares will rally from here. I see BITF outperforming.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4644378-bitfarms-efficient-expanding-and-nearly-debt-free?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19457081.jpeg

42392191,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2Shd,1698413400,Sam Bankman-Fried Throws Caroline Ellison Under Bus in Testimony,"Sam Bankman-Fried began to testify in front of jurors on Friday in his criminal fraud and conspiracy trial.  Under questioning from his defense lawyer, SBF sought to deflect blame to his deputies.  The former FTX CEO conceded to making mistakes at the crypto exchange – the biggest being not having a risk manager – and said ""a lot of people got hurt.""  NEW YORK – Sam Bankman-Fried doubled down Friday on the narrative that the FTX crypto exchange failed due to mistakes rather than malfeasance and that his underlings made the major bungles in his first day testifying before jurors.  For example, he told the court he had asked Alameda Research, the hedge fund he founded with close ties to FTX that was run by his on-and-off girlfriend Caroline Ellison, to hedge its risks.  However, when asked by his defense lawyer in the criminal case whether Ellison heeded his advice that Alameda should “get shorter” to mitigate its risks and shrink its multi-billion-dollar hole, Bankman-Fried replied tersely, “no.”  The fallen crypto mogul, who stands accused of fraud and conspiracy, began his testimony in front of jurors Friday by saying he made mistakes at his now-fallen crypto behemoth FTX – the biggest being not employing a risk manager – and ""a lot of people got hurt.""  Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried’s lawyer, spent the bulk of Friday morning walking his client through the early days of the FTX exchange and Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's trading firm. The focus was on spinning prosecutors' narrative about the companies' collapse into a story more favorable to the defendant – portraying the firms as legitimate and well-intentioned businesses, and providing context to explain the motivations behind controversial business decisions.  In the FTX founder's telling, a much-scrutinized feature of the exchange's software, which let Alameda avoid having its positions liquidated and let it have a negative balance, was implemented to patch a bug in the exchange’s risk-management system.  Prosecutors previously said Alameda's ability to ""go negative"" was key to its ability to withdraw limitless amounts of FTX users' money. At the core of prosecutors' case against the FTX founder is that he used his trading shop to steal from customers.  As he explained the ""allow-negative"" feature, Bankman-Fried punted blame to his former colleagues: prosecution witnesses Gary Wang and Nishad Singh, who he says implemented the infamous system in response to Bankman-Fried's unspecific guidance to fix the error.  A core element of Bankman-Fried's strategy thus far has involved casting blame on former colleagues. In general, Bankman-Fried said he ""supervised"" Wang, FTX’s head of technology, and Singh, its chief technology officer, but alleged they were empowered to make their own decisions, with Bankman-Fried serving more as an adviser.  Read all of CoinDesk's SBF trial coverage here.  Bankman-Fried's early testimony also sought to cast other goings-on at Alameda and FTX in a more benign light than the one shone by prosecutors. Whereas prosecutors, for example, suggested Bankman-Fried and his colleagues customarily deleted communications to avoid legal trouble, Bankman-Fried testified that he was merely following a rule he picked up during his days as a young quantitative trader at Jane Street.  That was the ""New York Times test,"" which, according to Bankman-Fried, was a frequent point of reference at the elite quant shop. ""Anything that you write down,"" he recalled, ""there's some chance it could end up on the front page of The New York Times."" He added: ""A lot of innocuous things can seem pretty bad"" without context.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Started Buying Solana's SOL at 20 Cents Using 'Alameda Profits,' He Says at His Trial  Much of Bankman-Fried's testimony zeroed in on the propriety of the massive borrowing Alameda did from FTX (Alameda, he said, could borrow money like anyone else) and the exchange's ability to ""claw back"" funds from users to cover losses (covered in a portion of the FTX terms of service – albeit one specific to a margin trading feature used by relatively few users).  Bankman-Fried appeared composed and confident on the witness stand. The former billionaire was clearly eager to deliver his story to the jury, and the months he's had to prepare showed through the clear, deliberate wording of his testimony, and his easy recollections of his early days as a crypto founder. Bankman-Fried's answers frequently veered into breathless monologues, however, which invited objections from prosecutors and scoldings from Judge Lewis Kaplan, who advised the defendent to answer questions directly.  ‘Naturally introverted’  Bankman-Fried also contradicted his former inner circle members’ testimony about the purpose of his trademark schlubby look.  In her testimony earlier this month, Ellison had told the court that her former boss and love interest purposely wore affordable clothes and drove a non-flashy car to help FTX’s image. On Friday, Bankman-Fried testified that his choice to wear shorts and a t-shirt was out of “comfort” and that he kept his hair long because he too “busy and lazy"" to get it cut.  For a while after the lunch break, Cohen questioned Bankman-Fried about FTX’s marketing budget, specifically the purchase of the naming rights to the basketball team Miami Heat’s arena, for which FTX spent $10 million a year and signed a 19-year contract. When asked if he thought that was a reasonable purchase, Bankman-Fried said $10 million a year at the time equaled 1% of FTX’s revenue, and given that he understood sponsorships of arenas to be “above and beyond” in name recognition value, he thought the purchase was warranted.  When asked why Bankman-Fried wanted to be the public face of FTX, he said he hadn’t intended to be. “I’m naturally somewhat introverted,” he said. He recalled early on giving a few interviews nevertheless as the CEO of FTX and that he “did well” in those which led to more requests. After a while, it was too late to find a new face to represent FTX, he said.  The judge narrows SBF's defense  Before Bankman-Fried started testifying Friday, the judge ruled that his defense can include testimony about the role FTX lawyers played in deleting internal communications. But Kaplan prohibited the defense from bringing before the jury wider-ranging testimony about FTX's lawyers.  This line of questioning was previewed Thursday, after Kaplan sent jurors home for the day. The former FTX CEO, when queried by his defense team Thursday, made it clear he wanted to direct blame toward former FTX General Counsel Dan Friedberg and outside law firm Fenwick & West.  Bankman-Fried argued Thursday he felt comfortable with how FTX was operating because his attorneys had a role in everything from the company's terms of service to the setting up of North Dimension, a subsidiary of Alameda Research – Bankman-Fried's trading firm – intended to secure bank accounts and process payments.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried's Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day  But the judge didn't grant an advice-of-counsel defense across all the topics sought by the lawyers defending him now at the former FTX CEO's trial.

Although the rally seems to have cooled off, a particular crypto analyst’s prediction suggests that the bulls could enjoy total dominance soon enough in what will see the flagship cryptocurrency rise to $45,000. Bitcoin’s Incoming Phase Could See It Hit $45,000 In a post shared on their X (formerly Twitter) platform, crypto analyst CryptoCon shared his prediction on Bitcoin’s future trajectory. The analyst mentioned that Bitcoin was currently at the “Mid-Cycle phase 4,” which happens to be the period where the crypto token is heading closer to the “Cycle Mid-Top,” which currently positions Bitcoin to rise above $45,000. Related Reading: SEC Demands $700 Million Settlement From Ripple, Pro-XRP Lawyer Reveals Next Steps CryptoCon’s prediction seems to be made based on the Fibonacci trading strategy, as evident in the accompanying chart, which he shared in his post. The chart breaks down Bitcoin’s historical price data into four cycles, namely: Cycle 1 (2010-2014), Cycle 2 (2015-2018), Cycle 3 (2019-2022), and Cycle 4 (2023-2026). Source: X The Phases In These Cycles These cycles are further divided into five phases, which CryptoCon seemed to focus more on. These phases include Phase 1 (Cycle Lows), Phase 2 (Transition from Cycle Lows), Phase 3 (First Move out of the Lows), Phase 4 (Transition to Cycle Mid-Top), and Phase 5 ( Cycle Mid-Top). CryptoCon noted that Bitcoin’s price usually hits phase 5 quickly once phase 2 is over (about two months after, according to the analyst), and if that is the case once again, then $45,000 could be soon. If that doesn’t happen, he foresees that Bitcoin could face resistance at the top of the transition, where it is currently priced at $36,368. As to when all this could happen, he noted that October represents the first month after phase 2 ended. Therefore, the market could see the mid-top phase could happen as soon as November when Bitcoin will likely hit and rise above $45,000. Interestingly, CryptoCon’s prediction coincides with that of the crypto platform Matrixport, which estimates that Bitcoin could hit $45,000 between November this year and April 2024. In their report, Matrixport goes on to make a bolder claim that Bitcoin could hit $125,000 by December 2024. Source: Matrixport Bitcoin Halving Or Institutional Adoption? Different crypto analysts have continued to make predictions about Bitcoin’s future trajectory even as the Bitcoin Halving draws nearer. Some of these analysts have credited the event as the catalyst that will spark the massive surge in Bitcoin’s price. Others believe that the launch of a Spot Bitcoin ETF alongside institutional adoption is what will make Bitcoin hit new highs. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Is At A High Premium, How To Trade It Meanwhile, some contemplate that the market may already be priced in as to any impending approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF, as this is a classic case of “buy the rumor, sell the news.” If that is the case, many predict that we could see a decline when the ETFs launch due to massive sell-offs from traders and investors looking to realize their gains.

42392184,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2S7j,1698408248,"Digital Pound Consultation Received Over 50,000 Responses, With Privacy a Major Concern","The Bank of England received more than 50,000 responses to its digital pound consultation, with concerns over privacy, programmability and the decline of cash.  Forthcoming stablecoin regulations could outlaw more decentralized models.  The Bank of England (BOE) garnered over 50,000 responses to its consultation on a digital pound, Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said in a speech on Thursday.  The majority expressed concerns over privacy, programmability and the decline of cash, Cunliffe said at a conference held by the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C.  The digital pound consultation launched in February and closed in June, and the central bank has said a central bank digital currency (CBDC) will likely be needed, despite taking no formal decision yet on whether to issue.  Users of the digital pound will have access to the same level of privacy that they enjoy today when making electronic payments he said to quench concerns, adding that the BOE would not see people's data.  Respondents were concerned the central bank would make the digital pound programmable and constrain its functionality – something that won't happen, Cunliffe said. ""It would be for private sector firms to develop and offer, for user consent, payment services involving greater programmability,"" he said.  ""Criticisms of the digital pound have ranged from concerns that it would be adopted at a scale and pace that would disintermediate the banking system and threaten financial stability, to, at the same time, concerns that there would be no use for it and it would be a 'solution looking for a problem,'"" said Cunliffe, who is leaving his Bank of England role next week.  Bankers said in February that they worried a digital pound would cause a two-tier system between cash and digital money. The government recently legislated to ensure the availability of physical cash, he added.  Cunliffe said there had been general support for the CBDC's overall model, but that the central bank will refine estimates of take-up and holding limits. It previously proposed that individuals wouldn't be able to hold more than 10,000 ($12,000) to 20,000 pounds of the CBDC, at least during an introductory period.  Cunliffe promised a discussion paper on its regime for major stablecoins – cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to other assets such as the pound – ""very soon,"" and hinted that regulations could rule out more decentralized models.  The central bank ""will require a legal entity that can be identified as the payment system operator and held responsible for the end-to-end management of risks,"" he said. ""It is not clear that use of public, permissionless transfer mechanisms, at least with current technology, would be consistent with this requirement.""  The regime will also likely put limits on stablecoins on the lines of those envisaged for the digital pound, and banks who issue stablecoins should create a separate legal entity with different branding to ""avoid confusion among consumers and so avoid contagion in a stress between different forms of money,"" he said.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The crypto options market is booming. The notional open interest, or the dollar value locked in active bitcoin and ether options contracts on leading exchange Deribit has risen to $20.64 billion, according to data tracked by Switzerland-based Laevitas. The tally nearly parallels the peak registered on Nov. 9, 2021, when bitcoin traded above $66,000, 90% higher than the going market rate of $34,170. In other words, the current open interest in contract terms is significantly higher than in November 2021. ""The milestone has been achieved with nearly double the number of outstanding contracts, representing not just a substantial triumph for Deribit, but also a clear indicator of the broader market growth and the escalating interest in options among our clients,"" Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, told CoinDesk. Deribit controls 90% of the global crypto options activity.  Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade, likely to take place in first-quarter 2024, is the next step in the blockchain’s journey to becoming a scalable settlement layer, Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a note Thursday. “Dencun’s primary impact will be to increase its data availability for layer-2 rollups via proto-danksharding, resulting in a reduction of rollup transaction costs which will be passed on to end users,” the bank said. A layer 1 network is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s. Rollups process transactions on another, faster, blockchain, or layer 2, then port the data back to the parent blockchain, at a fraction of the price.  Sam Bankman-Fried began testifying at his criminal trial Thursday without jurors present, an unusual move by the judge who wanted to review the comments first to see if they're admissible. Even though jurors weren't there to hear him, Bankman-Fried's first performance on the witness stand – delivered while he was under oath – was remarkable. The FTX founder's decision to testify is risky. While Bankman-Fried has tried to frame the collapse of his multibillion-dollar FTX crypto exchange as an unavoidable accident – he gave interviews to reporters, started a Substack newsletter and tweeted to downplay his culpability after his company filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 – he has exposed himself to tough questioning from prosecutors.  Chart of The Day  The chart shows bitcoin's price has risen 34% since early September, decoupling from Wall Street's tech-heavy index, which has dropped by nearly 9%.  The impending BTC reward halving, due early next year, may ensure the correlation between the two assets remains weak.

However, the token’s price has slightly retraced in the last 24 hours, likely due to buyers taking profit after an aggressive accumulation phase for LINK tokens. Chainlink’s notable uptick could be due to the ongoing bullish waves in the broader crypto market.

Can it conquer prevailing resistance to reach $15? Let’s find out! LINK Shows Signs Of Retracement, Is $15 Possible? LINK is in an uptrend after breaching the $6.99 support level as buyers re-entered the market and forced a rally to the $11.9 resistance level. LINK’s rally began last week when it surged from $7.42 on October 16 to $10.41 on October 23. While the rally has stalled, the latest strides show that buyers are intent on facilitating further rallies to retest the $11.9 resistance A move above this level would empower LINK to target $15. Moreover, the higher high candlesticks on the chart imply that LINK will likely consolidate on its rally in the coming days. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is above its signal line, displaying a strong buy signal. The green Histogram bars confirm this signal, which implies that LINK buyers are still active. LINK trades at $11.003, with a 1.62% increase in the last 24 hours. Based on LINK’s trajectory, it will likely break above the $11.9 resistance to reach $15 in the coming weeks if buyers sustain their charge. What Is Driving LINK’s Price Gains? Besides the general uptrend in the crypto market, Chainlink has recorded notable developments within its ecosystem, likely sustaining its price gains. One such is the integration of Chainlink’s CCIP by DeFi provider Affine. The Chainlink CCIP is the new industry standard for secure cross-chain linking on Ethereum and Polygon mainnets. Affine hopes to leverage the CCIP’s messaging abilities to create a cross-chain NFT bridging function for Affine Pass NFTs. It will ensure seamless and secure NFT transfers between supported blockchains. According to Affine developers, they selected Chainlink to host the Affine NFTs due to its proven security and reliability track record. More so, some experts forecast that there will be up to $5 trillion in tokenized digital securities by 2030. Chainlink will likely benefit from this expansion since it is a significant player in tokenized assets technology.

These developments are likely sustaining the price gains for the LINK token in the past week. Although LINK trades slightly above $11 today, it will likely rise to $15 if market conditions remain favorable.

The advance comes amid mounting expectations the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in bitcoin [BTC] early next year. AUM represents the total value of all the assets a financial institution manages on behalf of its clients.  ""October has seen major developments in the digital asset space,"" CCData said in a report shared with CoinDesk. ""To start, six ETH Futures ETFs commenced trading on [the] 2nd, giving investors exposure to ETH futures. Shortly after, Bitcoin's price surged by 7.56% in less than an hour to a peak of $30,009 driven by rumours regarding the approval of BlackRock's application.""  ""These events, among others, have ignited investor sentiment and raised hopes for the imminent approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF,"" CCData added.  Regarding crypto-specific fund flows, bitcoin-based products increased their market share to 73.3% from 70.5% in September, with AUM rising 11.1% to $23.2 billion, the report said.  AUM in products tied to ether [ETH], the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, fell 5.45% to $6.35 billion. The market share of ether-based products declined to 20.1% from 22.6% in September.  The divergent trends explain the ether-bitcoin ratio's monthly loss of 15.6%.  Products tied to Solana's SOL [SOL] cryptocurrency experienced the steepest AUM growth, adding 74.1% to $140 million. SOL has gained 54% this month, outperforming bitcoin's 26% rise.

Wright, who has said he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the author of the white paper that proposed the blockchain-based currency, wasn't in a legal partnership with the late David Kleiman when they apparently mined bitcoin together over a decade ago, judges on the Eleventh Circuit said.  The Kleiman estate, now represented by David's brother Ira, ""has not shown that the court relied on an erroneous legal standard or made a clear error of judgment"" when it struck down sanctions that were imposed on Wright for having, in the lower-tier District Court's words, ""wilfully obstructed"" the legal process, Appeal Court judges said.  The ruling upholds a decision taken by a Florida jury in 2021 as to whether the Kleiman estate had a right to half of the mined bitcoin, purportedly worth billions. Wright's lawyers shouldn't have probed the Kleimans' fraternal relations, but that didn't significantly impair the jury's deliberations, judges said.  The appeal did not cover the $100 million Wright was previously ordered to pay to W&K Info Defense Research, a company Kleiman founded, on which a separate dispute is ongoing.  Wright has sued a group of crypto developers in the U.K. for refusing to build a backdoor mechanism in a bitcoin-based software that would enable his company, Tulip Trading, to regain control of crypto it claims to have lost access to.  In a 2022 ruling, Norwegian judge Helen Engebrigtsen ruled it had been fair to describe Wright as a “fraud” and “scammer” for his claim to be Nakamoto, in a decision that has since been appealed.

A layer 1 network is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s. Rollups process transactions on another, faster, blockchain, or layer 2, then port the data back to the parent blockchain, at a fraction of the price.  Proto-danksharding will also “serve to set the scaffolding for future scalability upgrades, including danksharding, as part of the blockchain’s ‘Surge’ roadmap,” the report said.

42392180,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2RnD,1698400800,"Sam Bankman-Fried’s Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day","Sam Bankman-Fried began his testimony like the brilliant former golden boy from crypto’s better days. He ended the longest, strangest, most torturous day yet of his criminal trial more imperiled than ever before.  “Part of the problem is that the witness has what I'll simply call an interesting way of responding to questions,” Judge Lewis Kaplan said before a gallery of exhausted faces late Thursday. They and he were the only audience around for a special hearing that turned what was supposed to be Sam’s first day of testimony into a freewheeling “deposition,” as defense counsel Mark Cohen put it.  The only solace for Sam may be that the jury wasn’t there to hear it. Kaplan had sent them home after lunch. He wanted to hold a “for my ears alone” hearing to determine if some defense arguments were admissible – a practice he’d seldom done in his 29 years on the federal bench.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  This newsletter isn’t so concerned with the contours of their arguments. Still – because Sam is so concerned with giving EVERY DETAIL some airtime – we’ll touch on them briefly for context. The defense wants to ask Sam about the lawyers he leaned on while running FTX and Alameda (into the ground). The government does not want to let them do this.  To be clear, this is only a portion of the defense argument. When Bankman-Fried shows up Friday to testify in front of the jury, he'll have broader issues to discuss. But even if we put aside the specifics, the main issue may still be that he'll be the one testifying, and he'll still be subject to a cross-examination.  Shortly after you read this newsletter (assuming you read it at 6 a.m., which, like, you should) Judge Kaplan will decide whether to let both sides’ arguments play out again before the jury. Assuming he says yes, we’ll hear it all again and cover it then. Assuming he says no, well, you’ll get the greatest hits here.  Here’s the gist: Sam Bankman-Fried soared high with a strong command of the narrative and its characters when his lawyers walked him through what was almost certainly a well-rehearsed back-and-forth. He reminded the gallery – at the very least, this reporter – why so many people fell under the fast-talking crypto billionaire’s spell during FTX’s good times.  Sam stayed on-script, repeatedly pointing the finger at former FTX General Counsel Dan Friedbrerg and external counsel from Fenwick & West. They drafted most or all of the documents around the various policies that Bankman-Fried says prove he didn't intend to defraud his customers, he testified.  Sam excelled and even Judge Kaplan seemed to know it. When the 78-year-old jurist asked Sam to break down what a “block explorer” was, the explainer-in-chief launched into a lucid depiction of the websites crypto investors use to track where their tokens are. He emanated the eagerness and bravado of the technical boy wonder he used to be.  Even before FTX collapsed (and especially after, during an ill-advised media tour) Sam positioned himself as a confidence man with all the answers. His self-belief in the SBF ability to talk it out – this was paramount to the SBF image. Maybe it was the source of his powers.  On Thursday, it was the fount of his floundering.  Thirty minutes after the block explorer explanation (or maybe it was an hour? Time is weird) Sam's game of savvy answers gave way to jumbled evasiveness. On cross-examination he waffled on a question about FTX’s document retention policy, saying he wasn’t sure if his answer was “admissible” for reasons you really don’t need me to get into.  A bemused, slightly annoyed Judge Kaplan snapped back: “You worry about block explorers.”  Everyone and their mother (literally: one prosecutor’s mom was there, as well as the defendant’s) came to watch Sam Bankman-Fried spar with the government on his biggest stand yet. A rainbow sneaker-wearing Michael Lewis caught a delayed red eye from California to lean in on the penthouse courtroom’s wooden pews. In front of him, Sam’s publicist nervously chewed on a blue pen while three sketch artists added flairs of color to their works; to their left nearly 20 reporters scribbled in notebooks that were fast running low on paper. All around the courtroom a revolving cast of five or more U.S. Marshals kept everything under close control.  Sam kept himself under control – or, I guess his version of control. Which is probably not the control his lawyers want (which would be under their control). He continues to present himself as the master of his own story. At least, he thinks he is.  During a blistering cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon, Sam Bankman-Fried voluntarily defenestrated his unrecognizably svelte frame into a treacherous pit of legal whoopsie-daisy that even Judge Kaplan tried to save him from – and failed.  Reminding us all that humans are persistence hunters, Sassoon had already distinguished herself throughout this trial as the government’s patient testimony tactician. She lays traps that witnesses walk into, conjuring statements they can’t escape. Her command of her sections of this case is such that she can refer to documents, narratives and names that people like Sam really should know of – but don’t.  Her questioning of Sam forced the self-sure alleged fraudster deep into his own patchy memory hole. A typical back-and-forth went like this:  ""Did you have any discussions with lawyers about the permissibility of Alameda spending FTX customer deposits sent to Alameda's bank accounts?""  ""I don't recall.""  ""So what do you recall?""  He wrangled around many of her queries with over-answers, non-answers, indirect answers and apologies that he did not know more. The judge told him off for being slippery.  ""Listen to the question, and answer the question directly,"" Judge Kaplan instructed Bankman-Fried at one point.  On the stand, Bankman-Fried licked his lips so often that it resembled something of a tic. His mouth must have been dry, because he downed at least three bottles of water.  But he didn’t treat those bottles with the angry fists that have subconsciously betrayed his state of mind before. During his ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison’s testimony two weeks ago, Sam put those poor Deer Park plastic throwaways in an air-squelching chokehold and then capped them, preserving their crumple. On Thursday, he did no such thing.  Instead, Sam ran headlong into the flames of his own making. Toward the end of the overlong day, Sassoon asked him if he believed that safeguarding customer assets meant not embezzling their money. It was a gimme of an objection from the defense that Judge Kaplan inevitably sustained.  Not to be deterred, Sam plowed ahead and said, while basically smirking, yes.  “Haven't you been sitting here for four weeks?” an exhausted though definitely amused defense counsel Mark Cohen chided his renegade client, after reminding him that he didn’t need to answer things Judge Kaplan ruled non-answerable.  The courtroom giggled. Judge Kaplan threw up his hands and laughed.  — Danny Nelson  Courtroom scenes  An alternate juror asked to be excused because he was throwing up uncontrollably – but then asked to stay and ""refused to leave,"" Judge Lewis Kaplan told the court at the start of Thursday's session. After checking that everyone was okay with excusing him (everyone was), he sent the juror home.  Krystal Rolle, an attorney and King's Counsel in the Bahamas, answered a question that raised much confusion over the past two days – she is not related to Christina Rolle, who leads the Securities Commission of the Bahamas. Rolle just happens to be one of the most common surnames in the island nation.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Roos asked Rolle if she met with defense counsel repeatedly to prepare for her testimony Thursday and whether that's normal – almost certainly in an effort to undermine one repeated line of questioning from defense attorneys to prosecution witnesses.  We had multiple overflow rooms Thursday, though a lot of people left after realizing Bankman-Fried wouldn't testify before the jury or until after lunch.  Judge Kaplan lost his patience with both the DOJ and defense during various cross examinations: he told defense attorney Christian Everdell his attempts to get an FBI witness to discuss a list of group chats was ""not helpful,"" and that ""this is not an exam for new eyeglasses."" He later went on a long example about working at his father's deli in an effort to move AUSA Thane Rehn along when cross-examining a defense witness.  — Nikhilesh De  What we're expecting  Okay Sam's going to testify today. Like, for real this time. Probably. No he's definitely testifying. In front of a jury this time!  But first, Judge Lewis Kaplan is going to rule on the defense's motion to argue good faith efforts and role of counsel. He asked the parties to discuss any outstanding issues on the motion but he'll probably rule first thing in the morning. At which point we'll get the jury back in and they'll get to Sam's real testimony.  The revised timeline for the rest of the trial seems to be: Bankman-Fried will go through the direct examination and may begin his cross examination on Friday. That's probably going to continue into Monday. The DOJ isn't sure yet if it will present any rebuttal witnesses to whatever the defendant says. Either way, we may get to closing arguments by Tuesday, followed by jury instructions and deliberations.  We're getting close to the end folks. I'm genuinely going to miss it.  — Nikhilesh De",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,"Danny Nelson, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/27/sam-bankman-frieds-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In line with that, pro-XRP legal expert John Deaton has revealed how the settlement will play out. A Settlement Isn’t Going To Be Straightforward In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Deaton mentioned that he doesn’t believe “there has been a single serious conversation regarding settlement” between the SEC and Ripple alongside its executives. He said that the Commission is “pissed and embarrassed and wants $770M” as a fine for Ripple’s violation of securities laws. Related Reading: Forget 2023, Here Are The Major XRP Price Predictions For 2024 He further noted that the penalty phase isn’t as straightforward as some may think, as it is “like a second case” but one that requires more depositions, interrogatories, requests for the production of documents, emails, bank statements, contracts, and ODL transactions. The process is also made more difficult as while the SEC is insistent on a $770 million fine, Ripple wants to “drastically reduce” the figure, as Deaton stated. To achieve this, Ripple will be looking to exclude the ODL transactions, which the SEC may claim are under institutional sales that violated securities laws. Deaton also alluded to the SEC’s case against the decentralized content-sharing platform LBRY, which took “eight months of additional litigation” before the Judge ordered that the platform pay a fine of $111,614 to the Commission. That case was also not straightforward as both parties had to file multiple briefs again, and depositions were taken. How The SEC’s Case Against Ripple Could Play Out As to when a final judgment could come from Judge Analisa Torres, Deaton doesn’t foresee one until late summer “at the earliest.” With that in mind, he mentioned that it could take a full year before the SEC (or even Ripple) gets the chance to file an appeal in this case. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Is At A High Premium, How To Trade It The lawyer once again mentioned the role that Coinbase’s Motion To Dismiss (MTD) could play in this case and a potential settlement. He said that the SEC “will be forced to pivot its anti-crypto agenda and then work out a possible settlement with Ripple” if Judge Failla grants the motion. However, a settlement is unlikely if the crypto exchange were to lose its MTD.

Traders are attracted to the high-profit potential associated with altcoins and accept the high risks.  South Koreans are active crypto traders, with local exchanges outperforming their global rivals in volume, and have a strong preference toward altcoins and local tokens, according to a report from DeSpread Research.  The number of crypto investors in the country hit about 6 million, or 10% of the population, this year, according to a Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU) survey, the report said. ""The majority of these investors are primarily engaged in investment activities centered around centralized exchanges, making the influence of centralized exchanges in the Korean crypto market significant.""  Since March, centralized exchanges worldwide have seen declines in trading volume as bitcoin traded sideways. Local exchanges, such as Upbit – the country's largest, bucked the trend, with trading volume growth outpacing market leader Binance by July.  Part of the reason for the gain was a surge in XRP's price and trading volume after a favorable ruling in Ripple's court case against the Securities and Exchange Commission.  ""Korean exchanges had an explosive reaction to news related to Ripple. The trading volume of the four major Korean exchanges, which recorded $27 billion in June, increased to $37 billion in July, a 37% increase from the previous month,"" DeSpread wrote.  Korean traders, after all, are big into altcoins and not so fond of the major tokens, the report said.  ""The majority of individual investors on Upbit show strong interest in altcoins with high-profit potential and tend to accept the associated high risks. This is considered one of the reasons for the high proportion of altcoin trading in the Korean market,"" DeSpread wrote.  ""Cryptocurrencies that dominate the global market, such as Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Polygon [MATIC], boast large trading volumes worldwide. However, within Upbit, their trading volume shows surprisingly low levels,"" the report reads. ""This phenomenon indicates that Upbit has unique characteristics compared to the global market and reflects regional disparities in investor preferences and investment strategies.""  The preferred networks for transactions are different in South Korea as well, with Tron's network being used for the lion's share of transactions because of the relatively lower transaction fees.  While South Korean exchanges have registered a significant recovery in volume, the country's traders still use overseas platforms to store their assets.

42392177,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2RXp,1698397325,Floki Pounces on Trillion Dollar RWA Narrative With New TokenFi Platform,"Floki developers will today launch a tokenization platform dedicated to the rising real-world asset (RWA) segment in an effort to position the former memecoin project as a serious DeFi contender.  Called TokenFi – with token (TOKEN) as the native digital asset – the platform lets users launch any cryptocurrency without writing code. Users can then raise funds from the Floki community, connect with exchanges and market makers for liquidity, and float tokens tied to real-world assets that are not deemed securities.  Developers say they are trying to capture a piece of the global asset tokenization market.  “The tokenization industry is projected to be a $16 trillion industry by the year 2030,” Floki lead developer ‘B’ told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “BlackRock, the world’s biggest institutional investor with $10 trillion of assets under management, strongly believes in the industry’s potential, which they call ""the next evolution in markets.”  RWA refers to a physical asset, such as real estate or a car, digitized and made available in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Several analysts peg this as a “trillion-dollar opportunity,” as such products can theoretically allow anyone in the world to trade or invest in any global asset – which was currently a complex process governed by stringent business and financial laws.  The protocol will launch initially on five leading Ethereum, BNB Chain, opBNB, Base and Arbitrum networks but will expand to more blockchains in the coming months.  Incentives will be offered to users who use the protocol to launch their tokens or smart contracts. A percentage of TokenFi tokens will be set aside to reward protocol usage based on daily activity – which may create a flywheel effect that attracts users who keep using the platform for even more rewards.  Initial trading for TOKEN is scheduled for 3 P.M. UTC to launch on Ethereum and BNB Chain networks on Friday, where the cryptocurrency will be offered at an initial fully diluted market capitalization of $500,000.  TokenFi supply will be split evenly between the BSC and ETH chains: There will be 5 billion tokens on BNB Chain and 5 billion tokens on Ethereum for a combined total of 10 billion tokens.  However, more of TOKEN's supply can be acquired by staking FLOKI tokens, as previously reported.  “Users will be able to earn the reward token by locking up their FLOKI tokens for a period of between 3 months to 4 years,” B told CoinDesk last week. ""We envision this resulting in a significant portion of FLOKI tokens being locked up for an extended period of time, which will significantly reduce the amount of FLOKI tokens in circulation and add significant value to the FLOKI token.”",POSITIVE,ETH | BNB | FLOKI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | BNB | FLOKI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/27/floki-pounces-on-trillion-dollar-rwa-narrative-with-new-tokenfi-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65558fabb2c71a7a1465e8279801bc82c2bcab26-1440x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Read on to find out which sites our expert chose as the best. IN A RUSH? Go straight to our expert’s top pick. For the best all-around Bitcoin dice experience, DuckDice is our top pick. Play on DuckDice Now An Introduction to Bitcoin Dice Bitcoin Dice is one of the most popular crypto gambling games, and even though these games are relatively simple, they are one of the most customizable forms of betting you can play with cryptocurrency. Our expert picks the best Bitcoin dice sites and games available this year. This is because Bitcoin dice sites typically allow players to set their own odds, alter risk and reward, and determine the house edge level. Naturally, the lower house edge will mean less reward, but many players like the opportunity to tailor their gambling experience and win more regularly and consistently with dice games. Because of its simplicity, many crypto gambling players have come to regard Bitcoin dice and other dice games as one of the purest forms of wagering, changing little in their long history. Here, we’re going to explore some of the best Bitcoin dice websites globally and highlight some of the best Bitcoin faucets available. But first, let’s look at what a Bitcoin dice faucet is and discover some of the most popular strategies for winning at Bitcoin dice. What is a Bitcoin Dice Faucet? In this article, we will be looking at ‘Bitcoin Dice Faucets,’ but what are they, and why do Bitcoin dice players love them so much? Certain Bitcoin Dice websites will give players a tiny amount of BTC, like a faucet would leak a little water, to try out Bitcoin dice games without risking their funds. Some Bitcoin dice faucets offer substantially more Bitcoin than others, or they dispense at more regular intervals – so some players like to maximize their free BTC through Bitcoin dice faucets! This free BTC or other cryptocurrencies can either be saved up or used to bet on Bitcoin dice games to try and gamble up your crypto holdings. In the article below, we’re going to look at some of the best Bitcoin dice faucets so that you can make the most of your dice experience. Which is the Best Bitcoin Dice Strategy? We should start by saying that Bitcoin dice is a game of chance – ultimately, it’s a gambling game, and the house always has a slight edge. However, players can follow strict strategies to improve their odds of winning and increase their takings over time. Here are a few of the most popular strategies: The Paroli Strategy – A method that helps players maximize winning streaks and minimize losses, the Paroli strategy sees players determine a base stake amount, then double their bet after each win until they achieve three consecutive wins. The Martingale Strategy – A tried and tested strategy from the 1700s; Martingale strategy players gradually increase their bet amount when they are on a losing streak. The idea behind this strategy is that the increased bets will recover the losses incurred during the losing streak when the player wins. The D’Alembert Strategy – This easy-to-remember strategy increases your bet amount by 1x after each consecutive roll. The Inverse Martingale Strategy – As you might have guessed, this is the opposite of the regular Martingale strategy. Players increase their wagering size during a winning streak rather than a losing streak, maximizing the takings from a successful win. Our Picks – The Best Bitcoin Dice Sites Now you’re armed with some knowledge of the best Bitcoin dice strategies, let’s dive in and review some of the best places to play Bitcoin dice!

A growing Bitcoin dice website, DuckDice.io is a well-designed site licensed in Curaçao. As a Crypto Gambling Foundation member, DuckDice provides provably fair dice games in a range of cryptocurrencies. The site has implemented plenty of exciting features that have contributed to its popularity, and these have assisted in setting DuckDice apart from other Bitcoin dice operators in recent years. There are a couple of different games on DuckDice, including their main Dice feature and also some lottery games . Signing up to DuckDice.io is one of the most effortless experiences in crypto gambling – you simply click ‘sign-up,’ and DuckDice generates a username for you. There’s no need to enter an email address, and you can get started straight away. Users from the United States, the Netherlands, Russia, France, and Ukraine are not currently allowed to play on DuckDice.io. DuckDice.io Bitcoin Dice With a focus on design, DuckDice’s crypto dice games are well laid out and easy to play, with a fun ‘egg’ theme to show how much players have wagered. There are auto modes if you’re the kind of player who likes to set up their games and watch them go, or a ‘Flashbet’ mode, which lets power-players place hundreds of bets per second. Flashbet lets players set their wagering parameters and then executes hundreds of bets at the fastest speed possible. Once a Flashbet session is in play, there’s no way to stop it unless one of your pre-set criteria is reached or you run out of balance. DuckDice’s Flashbet is an excellent way for regular players who like to wager a set amount per day to play, so if you’ve got limited time on your hands, check it out! DuckDice.io Bitcoin Faucet DuckDice has both a generous Bitcoin faucet feature and ‘rain’ events where cryptocurrency is distributed to certain players. Their faucet feature allows players to collect free satoshis, which are immediately available to gamble on their dice games. It’s easy to collect BTC from DuckDice’s faucet – you either beat another player in a tic tac toe minigame or play three games in succession to win! However, the faucet feature is only available when you have no funds in your account. Players can choose to make it ‘rain’ on other members of their chatroom by clicking the cloud icon at the top of the site. This will distribute small amounts of crypto to everyone in that room, so it pays to know some high-rollers on DuckDice! DuckDice.io Supported Cryptos DuckDice lets players gamble in the following cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin Litecoin Dogecoin Dash Bitcoin Cash Ethereum Classic Ethereum Bitcoin Gold Zcash Monero Ripple Tether And many more In fact, in April 2022, DuckDice announced 7 more coins that will be supported on its platform including SOL, MATIC, LUNA, and others. They have since removed LUNA after its recent colapse. DuckDice new supported coins It’s incredibly easy to credit your account on DuckDice, only requiring a deposit address for your chosen asset. DuckDice.io Additional Features DuckDice’s Banking feature is a great way to minimize how much you spend. In addition to their feature-rich dice games, DuckDice also has a currency exchange, a ‘bank’ feature, awards, and regular contests. Users can transfer any supported crypto to any other cryptocurrency using DuckDice’s currency exchange feature, for instance, BTC to LTC, which takes just seconds and is great for quickly swapping the currency you’re betting with. There are regular contests, such as daily wagering contests for dice players with prizes up to 0.01 BTC. DuckDice’s bank feature is an exciting way to make sure you’re setting aside a portion of your winnings rather than leaving them all on the table. Players can deposit their crypto into DuckDice’s bank, which removes it from the available funds when placing a bet. Our Verdict A great-looking Bitcoin dice site, DuckDice is leading the way in terms of innovation and user-friendliness. They are jam-packed with features that other Bitcoin dice sites don’t have, like banking features, huge bonuses, and crypto exchanges, which transform DuckDice into more than just a standard Bitcoin dice site. Overall, we think DuckDice.io is one of the best choices for Bitcoin dice players regardless of skill level or wager amount. Play on DuckDice Now 2.

42392195,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2Sx1,1698392943,Bitcoin Surges to All-Time Highs in Turkey and Nigeria,"Declining national fiat currencies and a generally unstable economy have helped propel bitcoin (BTC) to all-time high prices in Turkey and Nigeria, despite the asset trading 50% below its peak in the U.S. dollar terms.  Recent price surges have caused bitcoin to cross price peaks against the Turkish lira and the Nigerian naira, data shows. As of Friday morning, bitcoin traded at 960,000 against lira (TRY) and 27.4 million against naira (NGN), extending monthly gains to as much as 30% in local currency terms.  Local crypto exchanges have traded a cumulative $40 million worth of bitcoin in the past 24 hours, as per CoinGecko. This figure may not include locals trading on global exchanges, such as Binance or Coinbase.  The naira has dropped 0.45% in the past month and 45% in the past six months against the U.S. dollar, while the lira has slipped 2.9% in the month and 31% in the past six months.  An IMF study shows inflation rates in Nigeria rose 25% compared to 2022, while it ballooned 51% in Turkey, causing a massive slide in the purchasing power of TRY and NGN. That has likely boosted demand for bitcoin, a perceived fiat alternative.  Turkey and Nigeria enjoy a fairly large amount of crypto adoption. A September report by analysis firm Chainalysis pegged Nigeria as the second-most active country, behind India, in terms of users participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto trading activities. Turkey was placed twelfth on the twenty-country list.  Expectations of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the U.S. drove euphoria among crypto investors this past week, driving bitcoin to 20% weekly gains and a near-record options activity.  Price volatility, which was absent in the past several months, seemed to return as bitcoin spiked to $35,000 within hours early this week as the discovery of a ticker tied to BlackRock’s proposed bitcoin ETF led to irrational exuberance – who may have believed it to be a sign of approval.  9:56 UTC: Corrects BTC's Lira-denominated price.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/27/bitcoin-surges-to-all-time-highs-in-turkey-and-nigeria,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/470806b426e0644423c9857f70f7d22173407fe9-4860x3634.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42392186,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2SN7,1698392929,Taiwan Crypto Regulation Gets Going With First Reading of Digital Asset Bill,"Taiwan took its first steps toward regulating digital assets, introducing a crypto bill to the Legislative Yuan for its first reading.  The Virtual Asset Management Ordinance Draft bill seeks to define virtual assets, set operational standards for asset operators, ensure customer protection and mandate membership in industry associations and regulatory permissions.  The country has so far taken a fairly hands-off and laissez-faire approach to the sector, regulating it only under existing know-your-customer and anti-money laundering laws. The regulatory process accelerated after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX last November because of the platform's popularity among Taiwanese due to its favorable U.S. dollar interest rates compared to local banks.  Unlike crypto rules in neighboring Hong Kong, the bill doesn't take a strong position on derivatives or stablecoins. It does, however, acknowledge that derivatives linked to virtual assets have unique characteristics (perpetual contracts are mentioned specifically) that may not fully align with traditional financial regulations, opening the door to crypto derivative-specific regulation in a later draft.  It also doesn't restrict trading of virtual assets to professional investors.  And unlike Japan, which specifically requires the use of custodians for locally licensed exchanges, the draft bill only requires the separation of customer assets from business funds. It doesn't explicitly mandate the use of third-party custodians.  The bill requires operators of exchanges to commission periodic reports from accountants about their operations and the assets they manage. It also requires them to allow regulators such as the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) to inspect their internal control and audit systems on a regular basis.  While this draft of the bill doesn't mention Proof of Reserves specifically, it does say the regulator will set standards for asset ratios after consulting with the industry and expects licensed exchanges to adhere to them.  Stakeholders from Taiwan's crypto industry have previously said they welcome formal regulatory oversight.  “Our next steps would be for the virtual asset service provider industry to collaborate with the FSC to define regulatory operations,” Wayne Huang, co-founder and CEO of Taipei-based fintech XREX, previously told CoinDesk.  A second reading of the bill isn't yet scheduled, and the FSC is expected to add its submissions to the draft before then.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/27/taiwan-crypto-regulation-gets-going-with-first-reading-of-digital-asset-bill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/786222cbd75a6c912c3551ff60cc49c33911c2dd-6865x3862.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19444276,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557810,1698391808,"XRP Price Could Blast Off In 18 Days, Here’s Why","The crypto community is abuzz with speculation as analysts draw parallels between the current XRP price movement and the 2017 Bitcoin (BTC) fractal. With several events on the horizon, many are wondering if the cryptocurrency is on the brink of a significant breakout. Cryptoinsightuk, a recognized figure in the space, tweeted yesterday, “XRP Blast off in T-19 days. I’ve seen a lot of people overlay the 2017 BTC fractal to the present day and to be honest it is following it VERY closely.” Accompanying the tweet were images highlighting the similarities between the two price movements. The 2017 BTC Fractal and XRP’s Current Position The first image shared by Cryptoinsightuk overlays the 2017 BTC price movement onto the current XRP price chart. The striking resemblance between the two has caught the attention of many in the community. The consolidation phase of the 2017 BTC fractal, which began around October/November 2020, is being compared to XRP’s current position. Elaborating on this, Cryptoinsightuk shared a second image, stating, “The consolidation on the left starts in October/November 2020. If we look at where XRP was at this time; It was right here.” The image indicates that following this consolidation phase in 2017, BTC experienced a massive 241% expansion at the end of 2020. However, it’s essential to note that while BTC was experiencing its bull run in 2017, XRP faced a significant setback. As Cryptoinsightuk pointed out, “We then crashed HEAVILY because of a Black swan event (SEC lawsuit was dropped on Ripple), whilst most other cryptos started their bull markets, breaking their previous ATHs (All-Time Highs).” Related Reading: XRP Price Confirms Early Stages Of Bull Market? Data Sheds Light On Recent Rally As NewsBTC reported, the SEC lawsuit against Ripple Ripple had a profound impact on the XRP price, causing it to plummet. This event has left many wondering if the cryptocurrency, after consolidating and three consecutive victories over the SEC in recent months, is now poised for a significant breakout. Will History Repeat? The million-dollar question on everyone’s mind is whether XRP will follow the trajectory of the 2017 BTC fractal. If it does, we could be looking at a substantial price surge in the coming weeks. However, as with all things in the crypto world, nothing is guaranteed. Cryptoinsightuk’s tweet ends on a speculative note, asking, “Will history repeat? Or, will XRP outperform after consolidating for over 5 years?” If history repeats itself, the XRP price could blast off in as little as 18 days. XRPEuropean chimed in on the discussion, commenting that there are several potential strong catalysts which could propel the price to new heights, “Love the countdown man. Lots going on with the settlement talks by Nov 9, Ripple Swell and ISO20022 on Nov 19 …. All we need is a Bitcoin spot ETF approval as well.” Cryptoinsightuk responded with enthusiasm, stating, “That would be fireworks!” Related Reading: God Candle Coming For XRP Price? Crypto Analyst Reveals His Target While the optimism is palpable, some analysts urge caution. JC Hodler recently tweeted, “BTC fractal does look promising for the next bull-run to start. But so did the fractal for XRP in 2021 to take the ATH out & it never happened because of the lawsuit. Still waiting on the Tether lawsuit that should have an effect on all coins. Only time will tell.” Will XRP Release Its Stored Energy? Renowned crypto analyst Egrag has weighed in on the ongoing discussions about XRP’s price trajectory, offering a bullish perspective. According to Egrag, a significant upswing in XRP’s price seems inevitable. “XRP Mega Bounce Is Inevitable – Fib 1.618 ($27),” he stated in reference to his 1-month XRP/USD chart. In his analysis, Egrag compared the previous bull runs of major cryptocurrencies. “In the previous bull run, BTC skyrocketed by 23x and ETH went up a whopping 58x!” He used this historical data to set the stage for XRP’s potential performance, highlighting that XRP’s journey was unfortunately halted due to the SEC. “However, the XRP journey hit a roadblock when it was slapped with a lawsuit, putting a pause on the bull run.” Egrag suggests that once XRP overcomes its legal challenges, it could unleash significant pent-up potential. He elaborated that the cryptocurrency, upon embarking on its next journey, “will release its stored energy, launching it into the cosmic expanse like a shooting star! A 40X move is on the horizon, representing a staggering 4000% gain, perfectly aligning with the Fib 1.618 from the 2017 peak to the 2020 bottom. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5509.

Escalating interest in options points to market sophistication.  Later Friday, Deribit will settle monthly bitcoin and ether options worth several billion dollars.  The crypto options market is booming.  The notional open interest of the dollar value locked in active bitcoin and ether options contracts on leading exchange Deribit has risen to $20.64 billion, according to data tracked by Swiss-based Laevitas.  The tally nearly parallels the peak registered on Nov. 9, 2021, when bitcoin traded above $66,000 or 90% higher than the going market rate of $34,170. In other words, the current open interest in contract terms is significantly higher than in November 2021.  ""The milestone has been achieved with nearly double the number of outstanding contracts, representing not just a substantial triumph for Deribit, but also a clear indicator of the broader market growth and the escalating interest in options among our clients,"" Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, told CoinDesk. Deribit controls 90% of the global crypto options activity.  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy and a put offers the right to sell. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, while a put buyer is bearish.  The record activity means flows in the options market tied to investors and market makers will have more say in determining the spot market price.  Market makers were recently said to hold a net short gamma exposure in bitcoin. They may have bought the top cryptocurrency as it rose to adjust their overall exposure back to neutral, inadvertently accelerating the price rally. BTC has gained 30% in two weeks to trade above $34,000.  Later today at 08:00 UTC, BTC and ETH options contracts worth $4.5 billion will expire on Deribit. Monthly and quarterly settlements are known to inject volatility into the crypto market.  Most open interest in bitcoin is concentrated in ITM calls or the ones at strikes below BTC's going market rate. Traders snapped up calls over the past two weeks as bitcoin rose from $27,000 to $35,000.  A call option is in the money (ITM) when the underlying security's current market price is higher than the call option's strike price. A put is said to be ITM when the underlying asset's price is lower than the put's strike price.  ""Options worth $4.5 billion will expire on Friday. That's a particularly high value of which an uncommon percentage is set to expire in the money (ITM) due to the recent market move potentially prompting some market action,"" Strijers said.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/27/bitcoin-and-ether-options-activity-soars-to-historic-highs-of-20b-amid-etf-hype,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8594ad2f9d171fc27d1007989b3231fc95f3ffba-1418x998.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price is now trading above $215 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bullish flag pattern forming with resistance near $225 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair might gain bullish momentum if there is a clear move above $228. BNB Price Eyes Fresh Increase These past few days, BNB price saw a decent recovery wave above the key $220 resistance zone. Bitcoin rallied over 20% to $35,000 and helped BNB avoid a major downside break. The price climbed above the $225 and $230 resistance levels. However, it struggled near the $238-$240 zone. A high was formed near $237.6 and the price recently started a downside correction. There was a move below the $235 level. BNB dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $208.3 swing low to the $237.6 high. It is now trading above $215 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a key bullish flag pattern forming with resistance near $225 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $225 level. The next resistance sits near the $228 level. A clear move above the $228 zone could send the price further higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $238. A close above the $238 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $250 resistance. More Losses? If BNB fails to clear the $228 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $220 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $208.3 swing low to the $237.6 high. The next major support is near the $215 level or the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). If there is a downside break below the $215 support, the price could drop toward the $207 support.

With seven out of the last eight days showing positive growth, the meme coin has not only managed to reclaim a critical low of $0.0000076 it registered in December last year, but has also encountered several notable barriers along its upward climb. In its journey through September, SHIB faced resistance from the established resistance zone and a daily bearish order block situated above $0.00000755. However, the October rally saw a significant shift, as the hurdle transformed into support, propelling the coin beyond the December low, with the current SHIB price according to CoinGecko standing at $0.0000078, indicating a 2.5% dip over the last 24 hours but still showcasing a substantial 14% surge over the past seven days. Related Reading: XRP Shines Bright: 14% Weekly Gains And New Highs After August Dip Price Analysis Reveals Liquidation Levels And Potential Pullbacks The recent price analysis report has highlighted substantial liquidation levels within the cryptocurrency market, drawing attention to a key threshold at $0.0000077 as the upper boundary for liquidations. Additionally, the analysis revealed that medium liquidation levels are concentrated within the range of $0.0000078 to $0.0000079. These findings indicate that traders and investors should closely monitor these price levels, as they serve as crucial points of interest, potentially signifying significant shifts in market sentiment and trading activity. The data suggests that these specific price points are currently important reference points in assessing the cryptocurrency’s price dynamics and potential market reactions. This information hints at the possibility of an extended pullback, potentially leading to a liquidity hunt that could drive SHIB towards the $0.0000077 mark. Source: Hyblock The medium liquidation level at $0.0000083 is a significant chart obstacle for SHIB, potentially posing a formidable challenge to any further price increases. It has historically acted as a strong resistance point, and breaking through it could be a key factor in SHIB’s future price performance. The bullish momentum of Bitcoin has the potential to be a crucial factor in helping SHIB overcome its current price obstacle, especially if Bitcoin surpasses the $35,000 mark. Bitcoin’s significant influence on the broader cryptocurrency market means that a strong Bitcoin rally could stimulate greater interest and investment in SHIB, possibly enabling it to exceed the $0.0000083 level. This highlights the interdependence of various cryptocurrencies and the impact of Bitcoin’s performance on its counterparts. SHIB seven-day price performance.

19431175,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557754,1698368425,"Ahead Of V4, dYdX Open-Source Code: Bull Run Incoming?","In what is seen to be a monumental move, dYdX, a layer-2 decentralized exchange (DEX), is open-sourcing its code as the platform prepares to implement v4. The exchange has a total value locked (TVL) of over $353 million, according to DeFiLlama. dYdX Open-Sourcing Code Ahead Of V4 According to an X post on October 24, dYdX plans to eventually operate on its standalone blockchain on Cosmos, migrating from being a layer-2 exchange reliant on Ethereum for security. The standalone blockchain, dYdX Chain, will be built using the Cosmos software developer kit (SDK) and powered by the Tendermint proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. In blockchain, projects often open source their code, allowing the public to scrutinize how smart contracts operate. By going public, the protocol is helping to build trust with users and community members, boosting security and increasing decentralization. This is especially important because the DEX handles sensitive financial data to facilitate trustless trading for all users. Related Reading: SHIB Will Lose Place To PEPE In New Bull Cycle, Analyst Makes The Case Antonio Juliano, the founder of dYdX, has already said the exchange developer, dYdX Trading Inc., is updating its charter to become a Public Benefit Corporation. The exchange developers will work on an open project without benefiting. Though the platform will remain a for-profit company as a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), the founder and the board will “not solely act to maximize shareholder value but act in the public benefit.” Still, the layer-2 protocol has to receive approval from the community through a vote before the project transitions to v4 on Cosmos. Afterward, as stated by Juliano, dYdX will become fully open-source and decentralized, meaning the community will take over how the protocol evolves through a governance vote effected by the dYdX Foundation. Will New Features Propel The Token To 2023 Highs? With v4, dYdX will build an off-chain order book and release an equally scalable matching engine that can process more transactions. This way, the development team believes this will “dramatically” enhance the protocol, all without charging trading fees, since it will run on Cosmos, a scalable layer-1 and interoperable blockchain. Related Reading: This Brand New Meme Coin Just Raised $11 Million In A Firesale With No Roadmap Part of these enhancements include making dYdX more efficient in trading. Subsequently, several features, such as batch execution and limit orders, will go live. At the same time, dYdX v4 will support trading new asset classes, such as equities, commodities, and real estate, making the protocol more versatile. Ahead of this transition, the native token of the exchange is trading at H2 2023 highs, looking at price action. Notably, the token has broken above July to October 2023 resistance levels with increasing volumes. At the same time, looking at the development in the daily chart, bull bars are banding along the upper BB, pointing to strong upward momentum. The region around $3.25 and $3.5, marking Q1 2023 highs, could be immediate targets for optimistic bulls.
