42402056,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3IT1,1540245615,Bitfinex Took 630 Million Tether Out of Circulation After Drop Below $1,"Bitfinex is sending massive quantities of tether tokens back to the vaults.  The cryptocurrency exchange has overlapping management and owners with Tether Ltd., the company that issues a dollar-linked cryptocurrency of the same name (often abbreviated USDT). Both firms have come under increasing scrutiny following USDT's dramatic break with dollar parity last week, when the exchange rate briefly dropped as low as $0.85 on the Kraken exchange. It has yet to fully recover.  It's notable, then, that a wallet address controlled by Bitfinex has sent 630 million USDT to an address known as the ""Tether treasury"" in six large transactions over recent days. The first, of 200 million USDT, was sent the morning of Oct. 14, when Tether's dollar exchange rate was beginning to hit multi-month lows.  Another 200 million USDT transaction followed two days later, when the token's price was beginning to recover its peg to the dollar. The other 230 million USDT was sent over the following three days.  Tether treasury balance (labeled ""Bitfinex Treasury"") in red. Image via Next Wave Strat.  These transactions have removed a massive chunk of USDT from circulation: CoinMarketCap shows Tether's market capitalization falling by nearly a quarter as a result, to $2.1 billion at the time of writing.  Exiting?  It's unclear why Bitfinex is taking supply off the market, but one theory is that Tether is getting out of the stablecoin business, buying back its own tokens at a profit.  This interpretation was put forward in a recent post by Su Zhu, CEO of the Singapore-based fund manager Three Arrows Capital, and a researcher publishing under the name ""Hasu.""  According to Tether's white paper, holders of the token can ""redeem"" USDT for U.S. dollars, which – according to the white paper – Tether holds in a bank at a one-to-one ratio with the USDT tokens in circulation. In practice, there is little evidence that people are able to do this, and some token holders have complained that getting fiat currency from the company is impossible.  According to Zhu and Hasu's argument, Tether is in effect redeeming the tokens with itself, buying them at a discount on the market and transforming the U.S. dollar collateral from a liability to an asset.  It's worth noting, however, that the tokens have not been destroyed, as Tether said it would do with redeemed tokens in the white paper.  ""Anyone could make money by arbitraging the USDT spread (the price at which it trades for on exchanges),"" Hasu told CoinDesk in a private message, adding, ""it would make sense that Tether itself would be participating in these buybacks.""  Indeed Dong Zhang, a Chinese over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency trader and Bitfinex shareholder, told CoinDesk that he ""actually made money"" from USDT arbitrage since the peg broke.  ""I buy from people who are losing hope on Tether,"" he added.  Doubt for profit?  Hasu isn't the only one to espouse the theory that Tether would pursue this kind of strategy, said a vehement critic of Bitfinex and Tether who goes by Cas Piancey. ""I've had others pose that to me as well,"" he told CoinDesk.  But Piancey disagrees with Zhu and Hasu's assertion that ""there is nothing shady"" about Tether hypothetically buying its own tokens at a discount. If the company is doing so, he wrote in a private message, it means ""Tether is only solvent through fraud.""  Matthew Green, a cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins University, echoed that sentiment, writing, ""by continuing (perhaps deliberately) to exhibit behaviors that increase customers' doubts, Tether can make a neat profit at their customers' expense.""  The recent drop in USDT's price coincides with growing doubts about the company's claim to back its tokens with dollar deposits. The company has been secretive about its banking relationships, which change frequently, according to reports. Nor has the company provided the regular audits of its fiat collateral promised in the white paper.  Tether did not respond to requests for comment before press time. A Bitfinex representative called Zhu and Hasu's analysis ""surprisingly fair given the multitude of accusations we face.""

For the project, the bank has partnered with Samsung SDS, the logistics and IT arm of consumer tech giant Samsung, and the Port of Rotterdam, according to a press release dated Oct. 19.  Using a blockchain system, the partners ultimately intend to move away from the current paper documentation surrounding international container shipments, including payments and administration.  ""An average 28 parties are involved in container transport from China to Rotterdam. The transportation, monitoring and financing of freight and services should be just as easy as ordering a book online,"" said Paul Smits, chief financial officer for the Port of Rotterdam Authority, in a separate release.  Daphne de Kluis, CEO of Commercial Banking at ABN AMRO, added that the ultimate goal is to launch a platform that will ""make the logistics chain more transparent and efficient, and millions of euros can be saved in the long term.""  Samsung SDS will assist with the technical side of the initiative, which is expected to see different blockchains operating together.  ""This takes place via an overarching 'notary' that connects entirely separate blockchains in Korea and the Netherlands,"" said Sanghun Lee, president, Samsung SDS.  The pilot will be conducted in January 2019, with the results expected to be declared a month later, the companies said.  A number of companies have recently moved to adopt blockchain technology in the supply chain industry. Last week, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Ports partnered with Belgium's Port of Antwerp for a similar pilot aimed to facilitate international trade.

In other words, customers who convert dollars into Universal Dollars can custody their holdings with Uphold, and earn up to 5 percent in interest.

""Traditionally, the average consumer has been wary of digital currency for two reasons: volatility and a fear that, if they lose their key, they lose their money,"" he added.

42402050,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3IN7,1540220455,Bitmain's Latest Bitcoin Miner Update Activates Controversial 'AsicBoost',"Bitcoin mining computer manufacturer Bitmain has released a software update for its Antminer s9 devices, using controversial code to allow them to more efficiently mine bitcoin.  Bitmain announced Monday that the just-released firmware will support ""overt AsicBoost"" functionality, bringing a speed boost to the miners. Notably, while Bitmain is only just now enabling these mining devices to use AsicBoost, the chips were already capable of supporting the function on a hardware level.  In particular, the post claims that this will ensure Bitmain's machines remain effective at mining the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization, while simultaneously increasing the hashrate of the bitcoin network and reducing its energy footprint.  The company explained that it previously had not intended to release software supporting the AsicBoost method due to concerns that the software may be protected by patents. However, the company's legal counsel had decided that there presently is no specific patent claim over the software.  According to the announcement:  ""Now we are pleased to give Antminer users whose miners have the capability to support this function a choice to avail this advantage without any negative impact on the Bitcoin protocol. This variant of the 'overt AsicBoost' simply uses version bits different from those that other manufacturers have been using. It is equally transparent because it can be seen in the blockheader of boosted blocks.""  Bitmain added that it also intends to release firmware supporting the same functionality for its Antminer R4, S9i, S9j, T9 and T9+ miners next week.  AsicBoost has seen some controversy in the past, with Bitcoin Core developers claiming that miners using the method – which exploits a flaw in bitcoin's proof-of-work algorithm to mine bitcoin a 20 percent hike in efficiency –were engaging in unfair practices that could harm the network.  While Bitmain was accused of covertly using AsicBoost in April 2017, the company denied using it in any production capacity.  Bitmain's software release comes days after software startup Braiins announced it would publish open-source code to enable AsicBoost on the Antminer S9 on its own.  In a blog post last Thursday, the startup said it had independently verified that the miner was capable of supporting AsicBoost, though it said adding the code would save about 13 percent of energy costs, rather than the 20 percent claimed last year.  In today's announcement, Bitmain noted that its btc.com and Antpool bitcoin mining pools both implemented AsicBoost from March 2018.

42402044,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3IIC,1540216786,"Accenture Tech Now Connects Corda, Fabric, DA and Quorum Blockchains","Enterprise blockchain customers might not need to worry any longer about having picked the wrong platform to build on, thanks to a new interoperability solution being unveiled by Accenture.  Revealed at the annual Sibos conference on Monday, the consulting giant has created an ""interoperability node"" which it says can house the business logic of different blockchains – in other words, the rules which allow them to perform various tasks.  According to Accenture, the interoperability node can connect the four major enterprise platforms: Hyperledger Fabric; R3's Corda; Quorum, developed by global bank JPMorgan Chase; and Digital Asset (DA).  David Treat, the global blockchain lead at Accenture, said the first bridging of blockchains was done between Hyperledger Fabric and Quorum, and then the same architecture was applied to connecting R3 Corda and DA.  The interoperability node provides lines of communication between two or more distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms and includes embedded business logic that contains standards, policies and guidelines by which the different blockchain platforms have agreed to work together, he said.  ""We built the first prototype of an interoperability node to sit in between Fabric and Quorum and got it to work. We have now built one that integrates Corda and DA,"" Treat told CoinDesk. But these are ""two example builds of the same solution pattern; it would work on any combinations of the four.""  Driving demand for this sort of connector, Accenture is now seeing the first use cases (supply chain, trade finance, insurance etc.) which have been progressing on one platform where clients are interested in the ability to work with another ecosystem on a different platform.  ""As an example, [there is] a supply chain ecosystem that's developing on one platform that wants to work with a trade finance ecosystem that's on a different one,"" said Treat. He would not name these projects, explaining, ""they are not ready to announce that yet. It's coming later.""  Accounting for differences  But these enterprise blockchains are not made equal; some have performed better than others in side-by-side tests, for example.  So the new system can account for different latency in consensus, said Treat, who sits on the boards of both Hyperledger and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. ""If one ecosystem's DLT platform runs significantly faster or differently than the other, then part of the logic in the interoperability node is to decide how to treat that.""  A transaction that's relevant for both platforms could mean the two ecosystems agree to wait via some kind of pending state to allow the other one to catch up, he said.  Further, Treat said that the strict limits on data sharing on R3's Corda platform, for instance, could still be harmonized with another blockchain where data is more widely broadcast.  ""It doesn't matter that R3 uses a different data structure, because we are applying the logic in the interoperability node that triggers the use of native DLT system capabilities about how they treat either tokenized assets, reference data or shared data,"" he said.  In terms of the overall performance of the new solution, Treat said the initial working version used a single interoperability node that obviously introduced constraints in terms of what could be processed.  ""On our development pathway, we are exploring the ability to have multiple interoperability nodes to share and spread the load. And also a version that would not require a single interoperability node at all, but actually just simply be part of the smart contract logic that any node can run,"" he added.  Richard Gendal Brown, chief technology officer at R3, said interoperability is key to avoiding the trapped assets and silos of the past.  ""We made specific design choices when building Corda to ensure that applications built on our platform can interoperate without friction,"" Brown said. ""The successful testing of these technology solutions is a significant step forward for blockchain development and validates our approach.""

42402042,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3IGE,1540213812,EU Securities Group Advises Regulating Crypto Assets Under Existing Rules,"A group that advises the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) – the EU's securities watchdog – has recommended regulating most cryptocurrencies and ICO tokens under existing financial rules, but said more clarification is needed.  In a report dated Oct. 19, the Securities and Markets Stakeholders Group (SMSG) said that, since transferable crypto assets used in payments (such as bitcoin) are increasingly considered as investments, the related risks are very similar to those seen in the capital markets.  It therefore recommends that the ESMA should consider such assets under the EU's MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II) regulations, which came into force in January.  While the SMSG advises the ESMA, it recognizes that the agency does not itself have the power to instigate such a shift in EU regulation.  The report, therefore, states:  ""This is however not in ESMA's power, since it would require a change in the Level 1 Text of MiFID II, so the SMSG can only urge ESMA to consult with [the European Banking Authority] on this matter and take this up with the European Commission.""  Citing the example of the Filecoin crypto project, the group adds that transferable ""utility tokens"" potentially carry risks for investors and therefore should be regulated under MiFID II. On the other hand, though, non-transferable utility tokens should not, it says.  For a third category, ""asset tokens"" – which are used to ""prefinance a new business project"" and may act as commodities or securities – the SMSG said it would need to be determined if a token is either a financial instrument (for MiFID purposes and the Market Abuse Regulation) or a transferable security (for purposes of Prospectus Regulation).  If an asset token gives the right to a financial entitlement, it has features of either bonds or shares, according to the report. Further, if transferable, an asset token shares ""important characteristics with transferable securities under MiFID, and are therefore subject to MiFID II and the Prospectus Regulation.""  The SMSG said the ESMA should clarify the MiFID definition of ""transferable security"" in guidelines, as well as clarify whether transferable asset tokens that give right to a financial entitlement should be considered as MiFID transferable securities.  If an asset token is non-transferable, the SMSG said it sees ""no need"" for regulation.  The report also comes out in favor of the creation of national sandboxes and innovation hubs for token-based startups. However, it suggested that the ESMA should ensure ""sufficient quality, transparency and legal security of national initiatives.""  The advisory follows reports in early October that the ESMA was considering whether to regulate initial coin offering (ICO) tokens as securities on a case-by-case basis.

42402036,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3ICI,1540209640,The Delicate Psychology of Stablecoins,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      There's an early scene in ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" that stalwart of holiday season TV viewing, that provides one of the most insightful on-screen depictions of the core challenge of banking: maintaining trust.  It's where Jimmy Stewart's character, George Bailey, desperately trying to stave off a run on Bailey Building and Loan, tries to convince a horde of nervous customers not to withdraw their funds. Failing to win them over, he eventually reaches for his checkbook and, drawing on personal savings earmarked for his honeymoon, writes personal loans to each of them to keep his small-town lender afloat.  This scene is worth contemplating amid this month's intensified competition among stablecoins as confidence in tether (USDT), the widely used one-to-one dollar-pegged crypto asset, has waned drastically.  Stablecoins, which promise that their token will trade at a fixed value relative to another asset such as the U.S. dollar or gold, face similar challenges in terms of building community-wide trust in their operations.  Bailey found the task to be more art than science. In the end, he had to put his own capital on the line to demonstrate that the self-interest of the bank's owner didn't trump those of its customers. We learn from this Hollywood classic that, in finance, trust is generated by more than just rules and technical specifications. It's contingent upon a complex, multifaceted array of signals that, often, come down to a sense of character, a concept that, in the corporate world of today, we could define as ""a trusted brand.""  At first glance tether's trust challenge seems different from that of old-fashioned savings and loans like the fictional one in Frank Capra's film. The latter is a commercial bank operating under a traditional fractional reserve banking model, where depositors' funds aren't held in full but lent out to borrowers. By contrast, Tether Ltd., as with other stablecoin issuers, asserts that it maintains a full reserve of deposited dollars to back every USDT token in circulation and that, because of that, it will always facilitate redemptions of those tokens at a fixed exchange rate – in this case, one-to-one.  The similarity emerges when we consider that a stablecoin's value proposition goes beyond a redemption commitment to existing token holders to encompass prospective token buyers. For a stablecoin to consistently trade at par, its issuer must, in effect, convince a wide a community of future tokenholders of its future solvency. And that degree of trust can be hard to maintain, as it involves the psychology of the market, which can shift significantly over time.  Just as Bailey found that his community's beliefs about him and his bank could be undermined by swirling stories and rumors and by a wider economic context that fueled fearful herd behavior, so too must stablecoin issuers consider a wide array of external forces that can shape trust. In the parlance of Wall Street, their quota of trust must be able to withstand a ""stress test.""  Managing market psychology  Consider Tether's predicament. Whether it has the funds it says it has isn't the only question. The other, perhaps even more important, is whether the market believes those commitments will hold up against a wider environment of waning confidence.  It's no coincidence that when USDT dropped to a low of $0.9253, or more than seven cents below par on Monday last week (on one exchange, Kraken, it fell even lower, to $0.85), it came on the heels of Wall Street's worst week in seven months. In that broader, shaky financial climate, where fear started to trump greed, news that Bitfinex – the exchange that has overlapping ownership and management with Tether – had temporarily suspended certain fiat deposits because of ""processing complications,"" didn't help matters.  Adding to the mix was the constant rumors and doubts over Tether's banking relationships (to say nothing of its reserves). Investors understand that, at the end of the day, a bet on a reserve-backed stablecoin is a bet on the counterparty risk of the controlling entity's banker. So all of this – the rumors, the glitches in deposits, and the market conditions -- produced a perfect storm to trigger an investor fire sale of USDT.  The new dollar-pegged tokens competing for USDT's sliding market share must now prove they can avoid such missteps. To do so, they must address this wider concept of trust, which means contending with the fickle, herd-like beliefs of human beings.  That goes for both those that employ Tether's reserves-backed model, such as Gemini's GUSD, Paxos' PAX, Circle's USDC and Trust Token's TrueUSD (TUSD), and the algorithm-based approach of offerings like basecoin, which despite their fancy math, will be subject to sophisticated attacks by bots seeking to ""break the peg.""  And, importantly, the real test of trust can't be judged on current circumstances, at a time when many of these new stablecoins are enjoying such an influx of tether refugees that their market price has, from time to time, actually traded above par. It will come at a moment of crisis.  As the Argentine government learned in 2001, when it had to abandon the peso's decade-long peg to the dollar with disastrous consequences for its economy, the ultimate test of a pegged-currency regime is always whether it can survive a moment in which market psychology is consumed by fear and mistrust. (The same goes for confidence in the banking system, by the way: it was the experience of the Great Depression that led the U.S. government to create the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and take aim the kind of corrosive, self-fulfilling psychology of fear that George Bailey had to contend with.)  A multifaceted approach to trust  So, how can these stablecoins survive such a stress test? The first step is to recognize that building lasting confidence in their brand requires a multifaceted approach and a special obsession with transparency.  For reserves-backed stablecoins, this includes practices such as: naming the banking relationship so that users can properly assess the underlying counterparty risk; committing to independent security audits of the underlying code to show that tokens are destroyed when funds are redeemed; holding regular attestations of the firms' balances by trusted third-party auditors. (Note: this does not mean a full ""audit"" per se. Calls for an audit of Tether were misleading; there is no way that a crypto system's past transactions can be audited in the traditional sense. Instead, proofs rely on attestations as to the accuracy of the firm's claims about its balances at a point in time.)  And indeed, many of the new kids on the block are employing this multifaceted approach, using an abundance of transparency and proofs of solvency. Gemini and Paxos, moreover, have incorporated themselves as New York trust companies, imposing a fiduciary responsibility on themselves. These multiple measures are necessary, says the white paper released by the Gemini Trust Company – led by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss – because ""[b]uilding a viable stablecoin is as much of a trust problem as it is a computer science one.""  Still, the fact that trust is hard to establish and easy to lose means that considerations must go beyond even these seemingly robust measures.  The core problem is that an owner/issuer's interests in any financial operation are not intrinsically aligned with those of their investors. To assure people that this misalignment won't lead to unfavorable results requires consistent, sometimes overboard attention to a brand of trust. In Bailey's case, it came down to pulling out his checkbook to show his character.  This is where the new stablecoins must walk a fine line in dealing with the tether fallout. They must, of course, differentiate and distinguish themselves from that failure, showing why they are more secure, more trustworthy.  However, if the messaging, whether on Twitter or elsewhere, comes across too strongly as a bid to grab market share, to profit from Tether's woes, one can imagine users imputing corporate motives that don't align with theirs. That could hurt the brand and cause its nebulous pool of trust to run dry.  This is not to wish ill upon these new offerings. We should all wish for their success. A successful stablecoin could not only serve the needs of crypto exchanges as Tether has done but also integrate reliable real-time digital payments in fiat-dominated tokens into a host of other blockchain uses cases such as supply chains and cross-border remittances.  The problem is that they'll have to face another crisis if we're to know whether they've succeeded.

42402061,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3IU0,1540206026,Bitcoin Bulls Must Push Price Past $6.8K to Win Control,"Bitcoin (BTC) has flat-lined after creating a bullish pattern last week, and now only a move above $6,800 would put the bulls in a commanding position, according to technical charts.  Stepping back, the leading cryptocurrency clocked a four-week high of $6,810 on Coinbase last Monday before ending the week (Sunday's UTC close) at $6,415. Despite the pullback from the multi-week highs, BTC ended up 3.7 percent higher on the week.  The bull move last week saw the creation of what's called an inverted hammer candle. This is characterized by a long upper ""shadow"" (the difference between the weekly high of $6,810 and the weekly close of $6,415) and a small ""body"" (the spread between the weekly opening price of $6183 and the closing price of $6,415).  The inverted hammer is considered a sign of a bullish reversal if it occurs around the bottom of the downtrend and the upper shadow is two times the size of the candle's body. Further, the longer the upper shadow, the more likely it is that a reversal will occur.  In this case, the indicator appeared close to $6,000 – a level where the BTC has likely carved out a classic bottom. However, the upper shadow is only 1.7 times the real body, placing a bullish reversal in some doubt.  As a result, the immediate outlook remains neutral and only a move above $6,810 would confirm a bullish breakout.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,400 on Coinbase.  Weekly Chart  As seen in the above chart, the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December last year has likely run out of steam near $6,000.  A convincing move above $6,810 (last week's high) would validate the bullish inverted hammer and boost the prospects of a sustained move higher toward $7,402 (September high).  Daily Chart  Over on the daily chart, price volatility, as represented by the spread between the high and low, fell to $47 yesterday – just above the 17-month low of $34 clocked on Oct. 13.  As a period of low volatility is often followed by a big move, we might expect some more vigorous trading action soon – possibly on the higher side, courtesy of the last week's bullish hammer candle. However, it's worth noting that bitcoin has been trading in a narrow range for months now and a promised sustained shift to either bulls or bears has so far not materialized.  View  $6,810 (high of last week's inverted hammer candle) is the level to beat for the bulls this week.  A break above $6,810 would raise prospects of a sustained move above $7,402 (September high).  On the downside, the 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) of $6,121 is acting as key support.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

Announcing the news on Monday, Synthetic Minds said the round was backed by blockchain investment firm Pantera Capital and Khosla Ventures, a California-based venture capital firm focusing on internet startups.  Founded in 2017, Synthetic Minds has just graduated from from startup accelerator Y Combinator's summer program, during which it also received investment and launched the first version of its technology.  The company explained in its release that it is building its product using a computer science method called program synthesis, which is utilize by organizations dealing with high value and permanent programs, such as NASA with the space station and the Mars Rover.  Since space applications and blockchains share these characteristics, Synthetic Minds turned to program synthesis to design automation technology that it claims is able to ""analyze (read) and synthesize (write) computer code better than humans can.""  The tech would allow blockchain and smart contract developers to focus on higher-level aspects of design, while the product itself would detect and optimize technological bugs found in blockchain networks' code.  The startup states in the release:    ""Eventually, using program synthesis we will be able to offload most of the programming for mission critical systems to software, leaving humans free to do high-level architectural design.""    The seed funding follows Pantera's recent news that it has launched its third crypto fund, with over $71 million committed from 90 investors.

Called Global Tech Exchange, the Brisbane-based project announced on its website Monday that its token sale has now ceased after the Australia Securities Investments Commission (ASIC) stepped in.  According to tracking site ICO Bench, Global Tech had intended to raise somewhere between 10 and 50 million U.S. dollars in its bid to fund the creation of a cryptocurrency trading platform. The token sale started on Sept. 12 and was originally scheduled to run until Dec. 10  While it's unclear how much the project might have already raised, company said it had issued refunds to investors as per the ASIC's requirements.  The project initially gained public attention in August ahead of its public token sale, thanks to an endorsement by well-known cricket player Michael Clarke, who announced his involvement in the project in a tweet at the time.  In today's notice, the company added that ""Michael Clarke is no longer associated with Global Tech Exchange.""  The news follows a statement from the ASIC last month that it had halted at least five ICOs since April 2018.  The regulator said at the time that certain token sales had been paused for restructuring in order to comply with applicable legal requirements, while others that were deemed possibly deceptive were ordered to halt completely.  At press time, the ASIC had not responded to CoinDesk's request for comment on why it had shut down Global Tech's ICO. According to an ASIC document, the company submitted a voluntary application for de-registration with the agency on Oct. 19.

The reduction comes in the wake of the platform's activation of a highly-anticipated new form of cryptography named ""bulletproofs,"" a new technology that seeks to make the monero network's privacy features more scalable by restructuring how its confidential transactions are verified.  According to data published by BitInfoCharts, average monero fees fell from about $0.54 cents on Thursday to roughly $0.021 cents as of Saturday – a 96 percent drop.  Such a dramatic shift was previously predicted by monero developers speaking to CoinDesk. ""I think you can safely say a typical [transaction] fee goes down by more than 95 percent,"" monero core developer ""moneromooo"" remarked last week.  Moneromooo also said that fee reductions could even be lower, depending on the kind of transaction that users create.  Alongside bulletproofs, the upgrade, performed via a mechanism called a hard fork, contained other features intended to improve privacy on the platform, as well as new code to deter manufacturers from building specialized mining hardware for monero.  Speaking on IRC last week, developers celebrated the upgrade, with Sarang Noether, a cryptographer at the Monero Research Lab that led the work on the bulletproofs implementation, writing that ""it's gonna be great seeing the blockchain growth charts.""  There were also predictions that the drop on fees might open the door to additional uses for XMR, the cryptocurrency that powers the monero blockchain. Core developer ""hyc"" said that the upgrade was ""definitely making the notion of micropayments more palatable again.""

42402052,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3IQ4,1540186230,China's Internet Censor Releases Draft Regulation for Blockchain Startups,"China's top-level internet censorship agency has set out how it plans to regulate blockchain-related service providers in the country.  The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) published a draft policy on Friday, called ""The Regulation for Managing Blockchain Information Services"" and is now looking for public feedback before it will take effect.  The rules, if enacted, would apply to any China-based entity regarded as a blockchain information service provider, and would represent one of the country's first regulatory frameworks drawn up specifically for the blockchain industry.  In the draft, the CAC defines blockchain information service providers as ""entities or nodes"" that offer information services to the public – ""both institutions and individuals"" – using blockchain technology via desktop sites or mobile apps.  Among the 23 articles proposed in the draft, one requires blockchain service providers to register with the agency within 10 days of starting to offer services to the public.  The proposed draft also orders that blockchain startups must register their names, service types, industry fields and server addresses with the CAC. This information would become publicly available and the CAC would conduct reviews on a yearly basis.  While the agency does not clearly outline what types of blockchain startups fall under its definition, some industry experts in China have said the proposed rules could have an impact on the ""supernodes"" of certain blockchain networks.  Jiang Zhuo'er, founder of the BTC.TOP mining pool, posted his views on the draft over the weekend, saying:  ""For example, each of the 21 supernodes of the EOS network is operated by a company or an individual. As such, they must be fully compliant [with this regulation].""  Also in the draft rules, blockchain service providers in certain highly regulated fields in the country, such as news reporting, publishing, education and the pharmaceutical industry, must also obtain licenses from relevant authorities prior to registration with the CAC.  Further, service providers would not allowed to use blockchain technology to ""produce, duplicate, publish, and disseminate"" information or content that is prohibited by Chinese laws.  In the past, blockchain technology has been utilized to bypass China's heavy handed internet censorship – often dubbed ""The Great Firewall"". For example, as part of the #Metoo movement and a recent pharmaceutical scandal in the country, individuals have posted information on the ethereum blockchain where it cannot be censored.  Another proposed article in the draft also requires blockchain information service providers to enforce know-your-customer (KYC) measures by gathering users' national identification numbers or mobile phone numbers.  ""Service providers must store the logs and content published by users of their blockchain services for six months and provide this information to law enforcement when required,"" the draft policy states.  The public now has until Nov. 2 to submit any feedback before the draft policy takes the next step towards becoming official policy.

42402017,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Foi,1540174548,Hong Kong Stock Exchange: Existing Laws Should Apply to Blockchain,"The Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) has proposed that fintech firms, including those focused on blockchain and cryptocurrency, are best regulated under existing financial regulations.  In a research report published Oct. 18, the HKEX's Chief China Economist's Office and Innovation Lab looked primarily at the potential of blockchain and AI within areas of finance, providing an overview of blockchain and possible use cases in trading, settlement and equities markets, for example.  Emerging technologies such as blockchain, it says, could be ""integrated in the areas of investment, trading, clearing and settlement,"" adding that regulations, too, should be common to all companies in the finance space.  While different jurisdictions may apply different rules to the technology in some use cases, the authors suggest applying what they call the ""consistency principle"" in financial regulation – that is, that ""financial businesses of the same nature should be subject to the same regulation.""  ""The principle of consistency requires that ... the issuance of digital currencies and digital funds must be governed under the existing securities regulatory framework,"" the authors said, adding:  ""The public fund-raising activities of shares issuance by issuers — which do so with merely a prospectus published on the internet but without any underwriter nor compliance with the IPO registration procedures or strict disclosure requirements — must be rectified by subjecting them to the governance by the Securities Law.""  Further, bringing similar financial services under existing rules would ""maintain fair competition, ensure regulatory effectiveness and prevent regulatory arbitrage,"" the report argued.  One potential issue raised, though is that the fast-changing nature of fintech can potentially open up regulatory ""loopholes."" As a result, it said, regulations need to be ""continuously updated"" to keep pace with technological change.  The report came on the same day that that global money-laundering watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force, said it will draw up rules for international cryptocurrency regulation by next June.  The move would see any country that wants to stay included in the international finance system having to license and regulate exchanges, wallet providers and firms connect to initial coin offerings.  Earlier in March of this year, HKEX was reportedly in talks with its antipodean counterpart, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), to learn from its experiences in shifting over to a blockchain settlement system.
