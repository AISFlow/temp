The news service said that the FTC cited provisions in the agreements which it argued place undue financial burdens on users in the event that they end their memberships.¬†The Korean FTC did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  The FTC's move represents the latest measure taken by the Korean government to police the cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem.

That move came on the heels of public reports of an investigation into possible tax evasion.

Put forward in February  , Senate Bill 464 would, if passed, mandate that the state¬†accepts bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. Other states, including Arizona, are also considering similar proposals.  Yet according to Senator Mike Williams, one of the bill's sponsors, never got a committee hearing before the Georgia Senate adjourned for its recess on March 29. As a result, he said,¬†the bill will need to be reintroduced during the next legislative session, which starts next January.  Williams attributed the bill's lack of progress to misconceptions about the technology among lawmakers, telling CoinDesk:  ""There was a lack of understanding on what cryptocurrency is, and when I was talking to senators there was that old-school 'isn‚Äôt that what was used to buy drugs?' [Passing the bill is]¬†going to take educating decision-makers and government regulators on what cryptocurrencies are.""  Williams suggested that holding hearings and other educational events could help lawmakers better understand cryptocurrencies, praising similar events that have taken place at both the state and federal level.  ""The more we can talk to legislators and the general public, the more we can educate on the beneficial aspects of blockchain,"" he said.  Williams ‚Äì who is running for governor in Georgia, which holds its vote this November ‚Äì similarly praised the ""cautious"" approach being taken by federal regulators, citing recent actions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in particular.  ""We do need regulation in the [initial coin offering] space but we don't need too much. We don't want the regulators to come in and clamp down on the innovation, but at the same time we do need to protect the public from the bad apples,"" said Williams.

The Chelan County Public Utility District (PUD) said Monday the three mines ‚Äì located separately in Wenatchee, Malaga and Chelan ‚Äì were ""using enough power to create fire risks for neighbors and damage grid equipment not sized for the load."" For that reason, utility officials disconnected the power at those sites.  ""Not only are we concerned, we're incensed that individuals are putting people at risk,"" PUD Commissioner Steve McKenna said in a statement issued April 2. ""We're not going to tolerate it. This is a strong message, and I want to make that very clear.""  The PUD said that in the future, rogue operators could face potential legal repercussions for power theft and public safety endangerment. However, PUD commissioner Garry Arseneault clarified that any heightened restrictions would focus on unknown mining operations, and not miners that are approved and followed the rules.  Arseneault was quoted as saying:  ""What we‚Äôre discussing is a person who is purposely trying to slip around the end and use power in a way that a facility was not designed for and doing so in a manner where there‚Äôs been no request for service. ... I see yet, once again, a reason to support the installation of automated meters to be able to confront these scoundrels before they do burn an apartment building down and perhaps kill a family or children in the process.""  Chelan County ‚Äì a region known for its abundant hydropower ‚Äì is an attractive site for industrial-scale miners, who tap the region's comparatively cheap power to maximize profits.  Yet the PUD imposed a moratorium on new bitcoin mines last month, citing safety concerns, as previously reported.  Other local governments in the area are reportedly making similar moves.  Wenatchee, for example, recently passed new cryptocurrency mining ordinances.

42428781,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe3Nh,1522854000,Ether's Start to 2018 Has Broken Records (In a Bad Way),"Ethereum's ether (ETH) token fell 47.5 percent in the first three months of 2018 - its worst quarterly drop on record.  While the notable slump came amid a general downturn afflicting the cryptocurrency markets, it was also exacerbated by problems more unique, perhaps, to ethereum.  However, although the decline appears major at first glance, it looks like a drop in the bucket when compared to the astounding 9,382 percent rally ether saw in 2017.  Looking at the historical data above, the cryptocurrency's previous worst quarterly performance came at the end of 2016, when it fell by 39.6 percent from $13.2 to $7.97, as per¬†CoinMarketCap.  But what went so wrong in 2018?  January: Record highs for ether  ETH began the new year on a solid note, rising to a record high of $1,432 on Jan. 13. However, broader market jitters pushed it below the $1,000 mark in the second half of the month. The cryptocurrency closed at $1,118 on Jan. 31 ‚Äì up 47 percent on the month.  Back then, the¬†investor community considered ETH a safe haven asset for the crypto market. The rationale behind the sentiment was that there will always be a steady demand for the token, given that most initial coin offerings (ICOs) are built on top of the platform and creators are required to pay fees in ETH.  However, this plus point proved to be ether's Achilles heel over the two months that followed.  February: US regulators hearings raise concerns over ICOs  In a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 6, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) focused on ICO fraud concerns ‚Äì a day that saw a dip in prices to around $650.  Still, ETH bottomed out at $574, tracking the broader market recovery. The ensuing rally, though, ran out of steam near the $1,000 mark and, by the month's end, ETH had fallen back to $850 ‚Äì down 23 percent on a monthly basis.  March: Sell-off gathers pace on SEC actions, social media ad bans  Prices fell below $500 on March 18 after the SEC confirmed it is investigating ""dozens"" of ICOs. Further, cryptocurrency ad bans by tech giants like Google, Facebook and Twitter did not help the price, either.  Overall, ether tanked 53 percent in March, tracking the broader market sell-off and hampered by its own woes.  Even so, while the first quarter of 2018 has not been a rosy one for the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, there is a bright side ‚Äì¬†the token is still up more than 700 percent year-on-year.

42428793,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe3nh,1522852253,Fed Governor Calls Out Crypto Market 'Volatility',"A member of the Federal Reserve's board of governors called bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies out for their ""extreme volatility"" on Tuesday, but made it clear that the new asset class does not pose a threat to the stability of the U.S. economy.  Lael Brainard, who also sits on the central bank's powerful interest rate-setting committee, told an audience in New York City:  ""One area that the Federal Reserve is monitoring is the extreme volatility evidenced by some cryptocurrencies. For instance, bitcoin rose over 1,000 percent in 2017 and has fallen sharply in recent months.""  She said that cryptocurrency markets ""may raise important investor and consumer protection issues, and some appear especially vulnerable to money-laundering ... concerns."" Brainard further cautioned individual investors to be aware of the ""possible pitfalls of these investments and the potential for losses.""  On the other hand, Brainard argued that cryptocurrencies were unlikely to ""pose a threat to financial stability,"" given that the assets are not commonly used in payments and there is little evidence that investors have borrowed large amounts of money to invest in them.  CoinDesk's State of the Blockchain 2018 report found that only 19 percent of survey respondents had borrowed funds to buy cryptocurrencies and, of those who did, more than half had already repaid that debt.  The central banker also indicated that the Fed would pay closer attention to cryptocurrencies in the future, saying:  ""Our assessment of these markets is limited by their opacity. Nonetheless, we will continue to study them.""  Elsewhere, Brainard devoted the bulk of her remarks to traditional asset classes such as stocks and bonds, where she said prices may be ""particularly susceptible to an unexpected development"" such as accelerating inflation. Still, she characterized overall risks to financial stability as ""moderate,"" due to financial reforms introduced after the 2008 crisis.

42428787,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe3bh,1522850419,Why the Time Is Right for the First Blockchain Governor,"Alec Ross was a senior advisor for innovation to former¬†Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and is the author of ‚ÄúIndustries of the Future.‚Äù He is now seeking the Democratic party‚Äôs nomination for governor of Maryland.      I‚Äôm running for governor. And I believe in the blockchain.  Those are two sentences that you‚Äôve probably never seen together. And that is a big fail for the public sector.  Harnessing the potential of blockchain technologies for government and public service ought to be as common sense as embracing innovation in clean energy and lifesaving biomedicine.  But we‚Äôre not there yet. I‚Äôm on a mission to change that.  I‚Äôm a Democratic¬†candidate for governor in the state of Maryland ‚Äì a state that leads in technology and innovation on the edge of the nation‚Äôs capital. I‚Äôve spent my career moving back and forth between public service and technology entrepreneurship.  I‚Äôve been following blockchain and the rise of distributed ledger technologies for years, and I profiled them in my book, Industries of the Future, to reach a wider audience.  Now I want to bring the transformative power of blockchain into public service. While I admire the early efforts of states like Delaware and Illinois to experiment with blockchain, I believe that the Old Line State ‚Äì ironically, given its nickname ‚Äì has the capacity to take blockchain innovation to a whole new level.  I want to make Maryland the state that shows governments around the country and the world how to foster blockchain businesses and apply blockchain benefits to government itself.  Fertile ground for blockchain  On fostering blockchain businesses, consider the leading industries in our state:  Biohealth and life sciences  IT and cybersecurity  Advanced manufacturing  Military and federal government  Aerospace and defense  Financial services  Energy and sustainability  Agribusiness  These are ready-made for a major wave of blockchain applications.  We can leverage powerful public-private partnerships, R&D funding, and public-sector programs to stoke development in sector-specific blockchain technologies.  We can also leverage Maryland‚Äôs world-class university system to create a pipeline of blockchain talent to fill these jobs of the future. We can make Maryland the go-to place for blockchain companies to pilot new products and launch new business models.  On applying blockchain to government, I believe that the fundamental value propositions of blockchain ‚Äì security, integrity, and authentication of information ‚Äì are central to the business of our public institutions.  Government is the trusted keeper of the records that make our society work ‚Äì from birth to death certificates, from education to healthcare, from business licenses to construction permits, from tax returns to court judgments and much more.  For generations, states have performed the basic functions of authenticating records of identity and ownership and verifying transactions, permissions, and the value of assets the old fashioned way ‚Äì with ink stamps on paper. This system enabled fraud, corruption, errors, and a lack of transparency that often left citizens wondering whether government systems served them or the other way around.  Blockchain gives us the chance to change how we handle the power to document, verify, and hold the information that instills trust in society. It gives us the chance to democratize that power, to make it perfectly transparent, and to reduce transaction costs.  As state governments go, Maryland has a decent reputation for using technology. We‚Äôve got the right institutions and many talented, tech-savvy public-sector employees. What we need is a big push from leadership for Maryland to be audacious and experimental with blockchain ‚Äì and that‚Äôs where we‚Äôre going next.  I‚Äôve stood with one foot in tech and the other in government for a long time. When I served at the State Department, I led the implementation of digital technologies in American diplomacy. It was rapid, disruptive, and transformative. And it worked.  State use cases  My vision for state government starts with these priorities:  Protecting information. Government is the most important holder of personal data in our society. After a series of high profile data breaches, public concerns over data privacy and data integrity are at an all-time high. Blockchain offers reliable means of protecting citizens‚Äô records where the management of those records is transparent but their contents remain private. Marylanders care about the security of their data. That‚Äôs why the state updated its data breach notification laws last year. But we haven‚Äôt begun to bring a secure alternative into play yet. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs next.  Registering assets. Maintaining a record of property rights is a critical public service. Land registries, real estate deeds, and car titles are among the documents that protect the value of our assets. Blockchain offers a convenient, low-cost method to maintain a secure public record of these assets that is both universally accessible and perfectly immutable. Every Marylander who has ever waited in line at a state agency to have a form stamped deserves better, and we can make that happen.  Certifying transactions. Among government‚Äôs highest responsibilities is the handling public tax dollars. Too often it is marred with fraud, waste, and mismanagement. We need to apply blockchain solutions to track how public money is spent. Through distributed ledger technology, every dollar spent in every contract for procurement of goods and services will generate a clear and transparent audit trail. We can notarize documents and private sector contracts. And we can eliminate our government‚Äôs reputation for shady deals behind closed doors.  Monitoring compliance. A system that certifies transactions will have myriad uses in the regulatory and justice arenas as well. For example, we can use it to track the market for regulated, taxed marijuana from seed to sale. We can use it to log the chain of custody of evidence in court.  Verifying identity. Government establishes a record of all citizens‚Äô identities, and citizens access public services based on verification of those identifications -- from schools to hospitals to voting. With blockchain, Maryland can make identify verification secure, portable, and paperless. Secure identity services on the blockchain deliver peace of mind to citizens as they make public services seamless to request and receive, not to mention cheaper to deliver.  Gradual evolution  Starting the blockchain revolution in government does not mean we are going to replace all our existing institutions. We are going to use blockchain alternatives to enhance current practices and strengthen their integrity, and create a pathway to fundamental change.  We don‚Äôt need to jump directly into a permissionless, anonymized blockchain environment. We can move first to controlled systems where the master ledger and authentication functions are stewarded by a trusted government agency designed for and tasked with that purpose.  The technologies government needs to institute blockchain-based services are already available, and citizens already have the right tools to access these services: smartphones and PCs. For most government applications, the scale of use that we might hope to achieve is already well tested in commercial markets.  In short, we have no technical impediments to progress. It is just a matter of political will.

In a Reddit post on Wednesday, Mark Karpeles issued a letter to the exchange's users, many of whom have been locked in a years-long battle to retrieve funds lost by the exchange. In the letter, he struck back at the idea that he would personally benefit from how Japanese courts are likely to handle the case.  As reported by the¬†Wall Street Journal, Karpeles stands to receive millions expected to be left over after the exchange's users have been reimbursed due to the fact all creditors would receive the value of their bitcoin holdings in Japanese yen, not bitcoin itself.  According to Karpeles, the exchange would receive more than ""160,000 bitcoin and bitcoin cash"" as a result, figures worth north of $1 billion at current prices.  Karpeles wrote:  ""I don't want this. I don't want this billion dollars. From day one I never expected to receive anything from this bankruptcy. The fact that today this is a possibility is an aberration and I believe it is my responsibility to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen.""  In particular, Karpeles further highlighted his intent to support a ""civil rehabilitation"" plan that would find the exchange advocating for creditors to be reimbursed in bitcoin, a proposal he's separately highlighted in past blog posts on the matter.  ""I never imagined things would end this way and I am forever sorry for everything that‚Äôs taken place and all the effect it had on everyone involved,"" he concluded.

At the Deconomy conference in Seoul, South Korea, on Wednesday, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin scrapped a plan to discuss his 12-month vision for the world's second-largest blockchain, opting for a more general discussion on blockchain and its potential.  That said, the discussion with fellow ethereum research scientists nonetheless gave a window into how the 24-year-old founder believes the platform needs to change in order to accommodate the growing levels of interest from developers.  Most notable were Buterin's frank words about ethereum and the low number of transactions it can process currently, a barrier that has been made apparent by the creation last year of the platform's first widely popular applications.  As profiled by CoinDesk, the ethereum network has been increasingly bumping up against its network capacity limit in the aftermath. As such, Buterin told attendees that anyone seeking to build a ""decentralized Uber"" or similar application today would likely be frustrated.  While the ridesharing giant sees 12 rides a second, ethereum processes just 15 transactions per second, according to his estimates.  Buterin remarked:  ""If you want to build a decentralized Uber and Lyft on top of an unscalable ethereum, you are screwed. Full stop.""  That said, Buterin's talk also focused on possible scaling solutions, including sharding, a proposal that would split up ethereum's blockchain, recording parts of its data store separately.  Still, while he didn't disclose a possible timeline for rolling out the solution, Buterin said he sees the barriers as more social and cultural, owing to the complexities of blockchains today.  ‚ÄúYou try to read any Wikipedia article about any math topic, it‚Äôs just bunch of incomprehensible formula of mumble jumble,‚Äù Buterin said.  Echoing that, ethereum research scientist Karl Floresch called for a wider community participation as the best solution to scaling challenges, concluding:  ‚ÄúOne of the greatest barriers to this space‚Äôs growth in a more productive way is the dissemination of the information that will allow people to evaluate and validate these protocols themselves.‚Äù  Buterin image via CoinDesk archives",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | RESEARCH,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/04/vitalik-ethereum-apps-are-being-screwed-by-scaling,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53fc4552206e786ffa225a8f84f00eed5ed91590-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to U.S.-based news site¬†Al-Monitor,¬†Hassan Firouzabadi, secretary of the country's High Council for Cyberspace, yesterday pushed for Telegram to be blocked in Iran on state TV, saying the firm's dominance in Iran was ""the enemy of the private sector"" and adding:  ""Telegram has officially announced that it will be used as an economic platform, and Telegram will undermine the national currency of Iran.‚Äù  On March 31, according to the news source, parliament member Alaeddin Boroujerdi said the move to block the messaging app ""was a decision made at the highest levels, and Telegram will be replaced by a domestic app.""  In response, Iran's moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, was quoted as saying at a meeting of government officials: ‚ÄúThe goal of creating and enhancing Iranian software and messaging apps should not be blocking access [to other apps], but [the goal] should be the elimination of monopolies.‚Äù  Rouhani was also cited as saying by Jalal Mirzaei MP,¬†‚ÄúNobody is opposed to breaking Telegram‚Äôs monopoly, but blocking Telegram is not the solution for creating [and enhancing] local messaging applications.‚Äù  Hassan Rouhani image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/04/irans-government-is-debating-a-ban-on-telegram-over-its-ico,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c7704d833a86dda604ff6338dbfbd045d8234fc4-1500x915.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42428799,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe3zh,1522836028,Bitcoin Bulls Need to Defend $7K as Corrective Rally Stalls,"Bitcoin's (BTC) corrective rally has run out of steam in the last 12 hours.  While that's not good news for the bulls, only a clear break below $7,000 would kill the odds of a move higher to $7,800‚Äì$8,000, the technical charts indicate.  The cryptocurrency clocked a high of $7,509 at 19:00 UTC yesterday, according to Bitfinex data, before retreating to $7,070 at time of writing.  The pullback has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency has created a minor, bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, as seen in the chart below.  1-hour chart  A break below $7,250 (head-and-shoulders neckline) would add credence to the breach of the ascending trendline and will likely yield a drop to $7,000 (target as per the measured height method). That would mean the corrective rally from the low of $6,425 has ended, given the head-and-shoulders is a bearish reversal pattern.  However, the momentum studies are still biased to the bulls: 50-hour moving average (MA) and 100-hour MA are climbing, while the 200-hour MA has shed bearish bias (flatlined). So for now, it appears any dip to or below $7,000 will likely be short-lived.  That said, the odds of a corrective rally to $7,800 (channel resistance) and $8,000 (psychological mark) would drop sharply if BTC closes (as per UTC) below $7,000.  Daily chart  BTC closed yesterday above the key resistance (now support) of $7,240 (March 18), strengthening the case for a corrective rally to $7,800.  The 5-day MA has turned higher (adopted bullish bias) in response to the uptick in prices.  If, however, bitcoin closes below $7,000 today, it would add credence to the downward sloping (bearish biased) 10-day MA and signal failure to hold above $7,240. Further, the 5-day MA would adopt a bearish bias, derailing the bottoming out process.  Hence, BTC needs to defend $7,000 to avoid further losses.  View  Acceptance below $7,250 could yield a pullback to $7,000, although the decline could be quickly undone as suggested by the positive hourly momentum studies.  A close below $7,000 would signal the corrective rally from $6,425 has ended at $7,509.  On the higher side, a convincing move above $7,509 would allow a rally to $7,800 (falling channel resistance).  An upside break of the falling channel would confirm the short-term bullish reversal.

42428796,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe3th,1522828802,What the Taxman Can Learn from Crypto,"Annette Nellen, CPA, CGMA, Esq.¬†is a tax professor and director of the¬†MST Program¬†at San Jos√© State University.¬†She is an active member of the tax sections of the AICPA, American Bar Association, and California State Bar, and chairs the AICPA Tax Executive Committee. Nellen maintains the 21st century taxation website and blog, including a website on virtual currency and blockchain technology.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto & Taxes 2018 series.  We are in the midst of a ‚ÄúFourth Industrial Revolution‚Äù in which technology is advancing at an exponential pace, bringing us mostly digital tools and processes. In the tax world, ‚Äúdigital‚Äù translates to: ‚Äúhow do rules designed for a tangible world apply?‚Äù  Cryptocurrency is a great example to remind us that tax as well as other laws and compliance processes need to be fluid to keep our economy moving ahead. Inaction or inappropriate responses can shut down or decelerate advancements that benefit society and lead to further technological progress.  From the late 1960s, when software was decoupled from hardware, to the birth of bitcoin nearly a decade ago, what have we learned that can help us deal with this asset and its uses as we encounter even more new forms of technology, uses and ways of doing business? This article suggests four tax lessons.  Strive to understand, not dismiss  Early in the history of cryptocurrency, the focus tended to be more on the bad (or, at least, illegal) uses than the good ones.  Certainly, actors such as the Silk Road marketplace drew a lot of attention to the illicit side. However, there was also potential for good in terms of helping populations living with unstable banking systems, allowing ease of micropayments, allowing immutable transactions, and more.  Fortunately, some of the first government actions did find some good. For example, a hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in November 2013, observed the promise along with the risks.  Early government actions also helped to limit the bad and enable the good. For example, the U.S. Treasury Department‚Äôs FInancial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), as well as various states, issued guidance to help those aiming to convert U.S. dollars into virtual currency navigate money transmitter laws.  The reaction around the world has also been mixed but with evidence of open-mindedness. For example, a March 2018 report of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) explores the possibility of central bank digital currencies.  Offer some guidance ASAP  In March 2014, just in time for the filing of 2013 tax returns, the IRS issued guidance on virtual currency. Notice 2014-21 answered 16 questions, but also provided an avenue for answering even more, by stating that virtual currency is to be treated as property for federal tax purposes.  ‚ÄúGeneral tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency,‚Äù the notice said.  With decades of guidance on the tax treatment of property, the ability to determine how virtual currency is taxed became more manageable. However, more is needed, as pointed out by the tax sections of the AICPA and the American Bar Association.  Don‚Äôt delay fuller guidance  Bitcoin has spawned hundreds of other cryptocurrencies with varying traits, capabilities and origins (including forks), and new uses including initial coin offerings (ICOs) that often meld this technology with crowdfunding.  Guidance is needed to ensure proper tax compliance for the users of these second-generation cryptos. Timely guidance helps strengthen a tax system and voluntary compliance by ensuring that all players are applying tax rules similarly.  States also need to clarify how their tax rules apply to virtual currencies. Several states have addressed sales tax, typically providing that it doesn‚Äôt apply to transfer of virtual currency and explaining valuation for when it is exchanged for taxable items. Recently, via legislation, Wyoming indicated that virtual currency is not subject to personal property tax. More such clarity is needed.  In addition to guidance from tax agencies, legislators must also be up to speed on changes to the law needed to support tax compliance and not hinder positive advancement of new technologies.  While congressional hearings on various types of new technologies and their uses occur on a regular basis, they have not been at the forefront for tax reform and modernization.  For example, the House Energy and Commerce Committee has held a series of ‚Äúdisruptor‚Äù hearings to understand new technologies including the internet of things (1/18/18 and 6/13/17), fintech, and digital currency and blockchain technology.  Comprehensive tax reform via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, however, did not include changes relevant to virtual currency. These omissions included information reporting by money transmitters, clarification of foreign bank and financial account reporting (FBAR), and a de minimis rule for reporting gains and losses (such as in the bill proposed by Reps. David Schweikert and Jared Polis, co-chairs of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus). Such a rule would relieve everyday users from having to report to the IRS and pay taxes every time they buy a cup of coffee with cryptocurrency.  Learn about the tech  New technologies affect tax compliance and administration. For example, bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies use the blockchain as the underlying infrastructure. The blockchain has uses well beyond this arena as many businesses and others are realizing and continuing to advance.  This affects taxation in that business records kept on the blockchain need to be understood in terms of how to audit such records. Just as businesses find value in use of the blockchain, tax agencies should also find efficiencies in terms of security and assurance if their records are maintained with this technology.  In 2017, Arizona enacted legislation to promote blockchain technology. The law expands the definition of electronic signatures to include ones secured through blockchain technology. The legislation also allows for smart contracts and provides helpful legal definitions of these terms.  Cryptocurrencies should also be considered for payment of taxes. They might also have value where traditional banking does not work, such as for state-legal cannabis businesses and tax payments. Arizona is now considering another bill which would allow tax payments using bitcoin, litecoin or other cryptocurrency recognized by the tax agency.  Summary  Cryptocurrencies and other digital technologies will continue to advance with more users and uses. The potential benefits to business and society are tremendous and should not be limited by tax uncertainty or complexities.  Following the lessons mentioned above can help ensure that tax systems don‚Äôt slow down these advancements.

42428791,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe3jh,1522821626,Motherboard Maker ASRock Confirms Plan to Sell Crypto Miners,"ASRock is planning to sell four graphics cards (GPU) specifically geared for cryptocurrency mining.  The company unveiled its Phantom Gaming Series last week, based on AMD's RX series. An ASRock America employee confirmed to CoinDesk that four of the cards ‚Äì all of which are versions of the RX570 series ‚Äì are ""for mining only.""¬†A fifth RX570 8G OC version, the employee added, is the gaming-oriented version of that product.  The confirmation comes after a presentation screenshot was posted on Twitter late last month by VideoCardz.com highlighting the planned products.  The move signals that ASRock ‚Äì which released¬†a mining-specific motherboard back in 2013 ‚Äì is looking to capitalize on the demand for GPUs by miners, who use the tech in the energy-intensive mining process. That demand has led to companies like AMD and Nvidia to see growing sales (though both firms have said that cryptocurrency miners only form a small part of their customer base).  According to a report from PCGamer, which covered last week's reveal, the RX570 series will run AMD's Radeon Software Adrenalin Edition. That's a notable detail because just prior the announcement, AMD updated the same driver to better handle cryptocurrency mining processes, as CoinDesk previously reported.  The confirmation came the same day that Bitmain, the world's largest maker of bitcoin mining hardware, unveiled a new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) dedicated to cryptocurrencies like ethereum and other ethash-based coins. The Antminer E3, which is expected to ship in July, quickly sold out after the China-based company started accepting preorders.

42428795,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe3ph,1522814401,What If They ICO? Investors Seek Veto Power Over Future Token Sales,"""I think it's fair to say that ICO-related language is making its way into term sheets.""  The comment, made by a partner at a major venture capital firm, shines a light on how traditional investors are tweaking their standard paperwork to deal with how a growing number of companies, both blockchain-based and traditional, are pursuing initial coin offerings (ICOs) as a way to raise capital from the sale of crypto tokens.  The partner, who requested to stay anonymous, said investors are requiring companies they back to agree to some kind of arrangement should the company eventually launch an ICO, and to make sure to have a discussion before the launch about¬†""whether or not this is a good move to support the long-term fortunes of the company.""  These new term sheet provisions only started showing up in the last six months, according to several investors contacted by CoinDesk.  It may not come as a surprise given that traditional businesses, such as social media platforms Kik and YouNow, are deciding that a crypto token would benefit their business model. But blockchain-based businesses have also diverged from their initial plans to stay away from token sales ‚Äì one notable example is Blockstack, which allocated a number of crypto tokens to its equity backers when it decided to run an ICO.  Because of the trend, the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) recently updated the language in its model certificate of incorporation documents,¬†""to provide investors a veto over token, cryptocurrency and blockchain related offerings,"" a press release on the update explained.  Several VCs CoinDesk spoke with said they'd seen the NVCA language on the term sheets of newer rounds they were participating in, though not all of those documents added language allowing investors to negotiate their terms if the company was to launch an ICO.  According to another venture fund investor that wanted to remain anonymous, those raising money through the¬†simple agreement for future tokens framework got away with launching without investor negotiations.  ""The early SAFTs had very few (if any) governance provisions,"" they said.  All this reflects a bit of a tension between investors and their investments as it relates to the overlap of equity fundraising and crypto token sales.  What to do?  The venture fund investor said that initially the potential of token sales was addressed through side lettershttps://www.icemiller.com/ice-on-fire-insights/publications/the-use-of-side-letter-agreements-in-private-equit/ ‚Äì agreements attached to the term sheet after the terms had been agreed on to interpret, supplement or alter those terms ‚Äì those these tended to require fairly involved negotiations.  But because of the complicated mechanics of today's crypto token sales, the regulatory gray area that surrounds them and the unknown effects they could have on traditional equity, investors are grappling with how to address ICOs in a more sophisticated way.  Stepping back, until recently, tech companies only really had a couple ways to raise money: sell equity or take on debt.  While crypto tokens have been touted as a way to raise money without diluting anyone's ownership stake of the company ‚Äì primarily since the companies expect enthusiastic backers to increase demand for the token which in turn brings the company a strong return ‚Äì the crowdfunding mechanism is still so new that it's an unproven strategy to a certain degree.  This then can raise uncomfortable questions for equity investors.  Veteran angel investor Jason Calacanis spoke to this, telling CoinDesk:  ""My advice to founders: selling two different securities at the same time, to two different sets of investors, is a quick way to get sued.""  Sure, not all crypto tokens will be categorized as securities, but many function similarly, and as such, Calacanis argued, that the value of the crypto token and the value of the equity will move in opposite directions.  And whichever party is on the losing end is likely to feel ""screwed"" and take action, he said.  Token strategies  That's why investors have come up with several strategies for mitigating their concerns here.  Although VCs generally didn't want to share the specific language they used within their term sheets or other sale documents that addressed ICOs, in speaking about different models being used, it seems three strategies are shaking out.  These include:  Governance. The approach taken by the NVCA, it requires that investors or the board of directors have an opportunity to vote on any sort of issuance of blockchain-based tokens.  Allocation. This approach reflects an investor¬†privilege¬†that already exists in traditional venture funding, whereby an investor in a company's early round can buy into later rounds if they want. Language in this model would just be amended to include future crypto¬†token sales. At least one new, smaller fund CoinDesk spoke to was taking this approach.  Designation. This approach states that if there's a token generation event, then existing investors would automatically receive a certain amount proportionate to the amount of equity they hold. A large, longer-standing seed-focused VC that's still fairly new to blockchain investing advocated for this approach.  Garry Tan, managing partner at¬†early stage VC firm Initialized Capital, for instance, argues for the latter approach, saying, ""Roughly speaking, investors are looking to link equity to tokens, and push for something akin to a pro rata share of the company's pre-mine. Otherwise, the equity doesn't mean much and could be worthless if there is no link between equity and tokens.""  But with the definitions of tokens ‚Äì whether they be securities or utility tokens or anything in between ‚Äì still opaque, it's been challenging for investors to really get a handle on what's happening.  ""I think it's important for an investor to get confidence that the founder has a prudent strategy given all that's up in the air with ICOs,"" Charlie O'Donnell of Brooklyn Bridge Ventures told CoinDesk.  O'Donnell is following blockchain startups, looking for a place to invest, but said he was unlikely to invest in ICOs.  He concluded:  ""ICOs might feel like easy money, but the other thing that founders are short on that kills them is time ‚Äî and legal battles can be just as costly timewise as running out of money.""
