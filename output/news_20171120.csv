42428125,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL61Fh,1511217902,Bitcoin ATM Installations Draw Warning from Russian Prosecutors,"Prosecutors in the Russian state of Tatarstan have issued a warning to a local businessman about two bitcoin ATMs.  In a statement from Nov. 16, the Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Tatarstan referenced cryptocurrency kiosks that had been installed in two locations in Kazan, the capital city of Tatarstan.  The office's investigation appears to have been sparked by local media reports. Although the connection isn't clear at this time, a Nov. 3 article from Business Gazeta and a photo from state-owned media source TASS dated Nov. 5 both reference a recent installation in Kazan at a local grocery store.  The reports triggered an audit of the bitcoin ATMs, which are said to be installed by a firm based in the Russian state of Bashkortostan and then leased to an unnamed 34-year-old businessman.  Officials said in a translated statement:  ""During the audit, the prosecutor's office announced to the businessman an official warning about the inadmissibility of violation of the law. Simultaneously, the information was sent to the Office of the Federal Tax Service for the Republic of Tatarstan to conduct a check for possible violation of cash discipline and other violations of tax legislation, as well as to the prosecutor's office in Ufa[...]to assess the legality of the activities of the tenant.""  Officials for the office in Tatarstan added that the investigation is ongoing.  The scrutiny over the ATMs is perhaps unsurprising, given that authorities in other parts of the world have conducted similar investigations – sometimes ending with the closure of those kiosks – in the past. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty persists around cryptocurrencies in Russia itself.  Editor's Note: Some of the statements in this report have been translated from Russian.

42428129,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL61Nh,1511212204,CBOE Releases New Details on Bitcoin Futures Contracts,"Options exchange CBOE has released early specifications for its planned bitcoin futures product.  In a blog post from Friday, the company published some of the technical details for its futures contract, which will be listed under the symbol XBT – that is, of course, pending approval from U.S. regulators. The development dates back to August, growing out of an initial partnership that saw New York-based exchange startup Gemini (owned by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss) providing data to the Chicago-based CBOE.  It's a development that adds further fuel to efforts to create trading products tied to the cryptocurrency market. With a futures contract, two parties agree to trade an asset – in this case, bitcoin – at a predetermined time and price. Those involved in the agreement seek to make a profit on the difference between the quoted price and its actual value when the contract expires.  Derivatives exchange operator CME Group is moving to launch its own product within weeks, and startups like LedgerX have been pursuing new markets for the exchange of such contracts.  And although the exact listing date isn't available, CBOE's website had other points of interest related to the XBT listing, including the indication that both weekly and quarterly contracts will be available. The listed contract multiplier is 1 BTC, according to CBOE, and the settlements will be paid out in cash.  In detailing the efforts to develop the product, CBOE's Russel Rhoads wrote that readers may want to avoid trying to predict how futures prices will relate to today's price, noting:  ""The question I am constantly hearing is, 'How will the futures prices relate to spot bitcoin pricing,' and the best (and most honest) answer I can give is, 'I don’t know.' ... Personally I think the best strategy is to see what the market tells us when bitcoin futures are available for trading.""  Rhoads also ran a comparison between the CBOE Volatility Index, its stock market volatility index and bitcoin's degree of price fluctuation, finding that ""they are pretty darn similar.""

He added:  ""A lot of internal processes can be contracted. We do a lot of IT procurement, a lot of it can be implemented using blockchain.""

These include smart contracts, which he said are ""not regulatory heavy.""

Using the AxCore distributed ledger platform from startup Axoni, the pilot – which also included BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse and Citi – saw the banks process equity swaps from start to finish, according to an announcementhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/multi-firm-blockchain-implementation-for-equity-swaps-completes-second-phase-300559102.html from today. The trial looked at the potential of DLT to streamline the way swaps are made.  By carrying out trades across a network where all parties use the same valuation data and share the same books, in theory, payments can be processed nearly instantaneously and disputes over transactions will be less likely.  Greg Schvey, CEO of Axoni, said in a statement:  ""Equity swap data is infamously complex and difficult to manage, making it a terrific fit for distributed ledger technology.""  Following on from a proof-of-concept from late last year, the pilot tested tasks like trade creation, amendments, swap aging and dividends. The pilot also tested factors external to the trades, such as network performance and privacy, although it was conducted entirely a test environment. None of the trades were real and no money changed hands, according to Bloomberg.  Axoni used a standardized data structure for the swaps, built in collaboration with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA). The collaborators also put together a governance framework to be used on a production network.  In May, Axoni closed a $20 million Series A round that saw participation from banks such as Citi and investors like Andreessen-Horowitz.

During the recent DFJ Summit, angel investor and This Week in Startups Host Jason Calacanis asked Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong to explain why his love for Bitcoin has faded. Armstrong’s own preference for Ethereum is well-documented at this point. According to Fortune, he currently holds more ether than he does bitcoin. On top of that, fellow Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam has written multiple Medium posts about the merits of Ethereum over the past 18 months. Perhaps most notably, Ehrsam published a piece called “Ethereum is the Forefront of Digital Currency” in May of 2016. Earlier this year, Coinbase revealed their mobile Ethereum browser called Toshi. How Bitcoin Broke Brian’s Heart When Calacanis first brought up the issue of Bitcoin versus Ethereum, Armstrong was quick to point out that he still holds bitcoin (along with ether and litecoin). “I think bitcoin was my first true love, but it did break my heart a little bit,” said Armstrong when pushed to clarify his position further. Armstrong went on to explain that he saw Bitcoin as an open financial system where payments could be made quickly, cheaply, and globally. The Coinbase CEO also mentioned the endless innovation that could take place on top of this sort of programmable money. “Bitcoin ended up not scaling to be that,” said Armstrong. “Right now, it’s ended up being a little more like digital gold. People are using it to kind of flee in times of uncertainty or to hold large amounts of it, but the transactions are too expensive on Bitcoin right now.” In Armstrong’s view, Bitcoin could operate at Visa scale, while cutting costs by two or three orders of magnitude. “It could be something on the order of one cent U.S. or less [each] to send every payment in the world,” said Armstrong. “That’s where we need to get. Bitcoin, right now, only can do about three to five transactions a second. Visa does about 4,000 a second, so we’ve got a couple of orders of magnitude to go.” While Bitcoin is going in the direction of a layered approach to scaling where all activity does not take place on the base blockchain (perhaps most notably via the Lightning Network), Armstrong noted that the vision of on-chain scaling is still being worked on by Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum. “That vision is going to be realized, but it was a little frustrating to not see the original Bitcoin get there,” said Armstrong. What Ethereum Has to Offer In terms of the benefits of Ethereum, Armstrong noted that, in his view, the Bitcoin alternative offers better scalability today. “It’s actually doing about double the number of transactions per day as Bitcoin already, and their scaling plans — the roadmap, in my view, is much better,” said Armstrong. While Ethereum is able to offer more transactions at a lower monetary cost today, it should be noted that many experts question the scalability of Ethereum due to its focus on more complex applications (as opposed to the simple transactions seen on Bitcoin). Even Ethereum researcher Vlad Zamfir has written that the network is not scalable. In terms of what Ethereum is used for today, Armstrong referred to the recent activity in the ICO market as a craze or bubble. “I would not be surprised if in the next six months or twelve months there’s some enforcement action by the SEC, some of these get slapped pretty hard, and there’s a bit of a correction in the industry,” said Armstrong. “And honestly, we’re probably due for that.” Having said that, Armstrong added that there is “something real” underlying the ICO boom. Specifically, Armstrong sees value in a global, permissionless crowdfunding mechanism that can be launched at the click of a button. Additionally, Armstrong sees value in so-called “utility tokens”, and he offered Filecoin and Golem as two examples of such tokens. “It does make sense to me that those [protocols] should have their own, native token — just because it allows essentially the early adopters, you turn them into evangelists,” said Armstrong. “It’s a great way, as an entrepreneur, to create a network effect.” Skeptics of these sorts of protocol tokens also exist, with one noteworthy take referring to them as nothing more than snake oil. Armstrong is also excited about Ethereum’s planned move from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. When asked about the problem of mining centralization in Bitcoin, Armstrong responded, “Ethereum, actually, is the most exciting answer here because they’re working on proof-of-stake, which would actually eliminate mining. I think in a few years, most digital currency could be proof-of-stake and move away from mining, which would be great.” While Armstrong’s heart is now with Ethereum, he still sees large potential upside in the bitcoin price.

Ether Looks Up on 11-Week High,"Having clocked an eleven-day high on Sunday, the price of ether, ethereum's native token, may have more gains ahead.  As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency rose to $371.29 yesterday – its highest level since Sep. 2. Week-on-week, ETH has gained 13.22 percent, while on a monthly basis, it is up 15.08 percent. At time of writing, the ether-U.S. dollar (ETH/USD) exchange rate is at $358 levels.  ETH seems to have pushed fears over the Parity wallet freeze on the back burner and moved higher to $350 levels in line with the bullish technicals as expected. The bid tone strengthened on Nov. 16 alongside a Bloomberg report that said the second-biggest cryptocurrency is poised to get its own derivatives market.  ""Contracts on the ether digital currency will be offered by an as-yet-unnamed exchange going by the code name Virtuoso,"" the report said. ""Virtuoso"" will reportedly be regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and plans to offer futures, non-deliverable forwards, swaps and forwards by the first or second quarter of 2018.  If the plan comes to fruition, ether derivatives will provide an avenue for yield-hungry institutional investors to invest in an asset that is up 4,000 percent on a year-to-date basis.  The price action analysis suggests ether is aiming for record highs and any dips are likely to be short-lived.  Ether chart  The above chart shows:  A solid bullish Bollinger band breakout  Prices closed above resistance of $350 (Oct. 16 high)  Bullish relative strength index (RSI)  All major averages – 50-day MA, 100-day MA, 20-day MA, 10-day MA – are sloping upwards in favor of the bulls.

42428117,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL611h,1511182805,Ex-Moscow Exchange Exec Emerges as Blockchain Boss,"It's been two years since a former managing director of the Moscow Exchange resigned his position in the aftermath of Russia's annexation of the Crimean region in his native Ukraine.  Now, after years of exploring his options, Roman Sulzhyk has become the latest in a string of senior-level executives around the world to make the jump to the blockchain sector. Not only has Sulzhyk invested in the Ukraine-based blockchain startup Distributed Lab, he's taken on a leadership role as chairman of its board of directors.  But while entering the blockchain industry has been compared to a religious experience for some, Sulzhyk's motivation is decidedly more political.  After spending much of his career working for big banks, Sulzhyk resigned as the managing director of Moscow Exchange's futures market in 2015, a year after Russia controversially took over Crimea.  Since then, the Moscow Exchange press office and Sulzhyk himself have both expressed support for one another, even while complexities around the departure persist.  ""Unfortunately, the political situation between our two countries at the moment does make it difficult,"" Sulzhyk said. ""Let's just say, I'm opposed to the politics of Putin.""  Still, the former chairman of the supervisory board of the National Depository of Ukraine and well-known advocate for transparency in the financial markets sees an opportunity in blockchain that goes beyond his professional history and past roles.  Sulzhyk told CoinDesk:  ""It's a natural evolution of my career. I don't view this as a sort of setback, I view this as a massive opportunity for me personally to be part of a revolution.""  Road to blockchain  In this way, Sulzhyk sought to frame his departure as a twist of good fortune, one that triggered his exploration of the right opportunity at the right time.  Sulzhyk said he knew almost nothing about blockchain before leaving the exchange, and as it turns out, that's exactly when the founders of Distributed Lab started to educate him.  Then, this July, he'd caught up enough on the technology that Distributed Lab invited him to speak at its BIP001 cryptocurrency conference in Odessa, Ukraine, and by September he'd personally backed Distributed Lab with an undisclosed amount of money.  But while Sulzhyk identifies as a co-founder, as well as investor, in Distributed Lab, the startup itself isn't new to the blockchain space.  Founded in 2014, the company now lists 50 people on its team working to build a wide range of enterprise-grade systems for issuing traditional assets on a blockchain.  ""I'm not day-to-day running development,"" he said. ""I'm more trying to work together with the guys to develop the vision of where the company wants to be in a year from now.""  Fiat cryptocurrency  Among the projects for which Sulzhyk is currently consulting as part of his new work is the National Bank of Ukraine, which has been exploring issuing the nation's native hryvnia currency on a blockchain since at least November 2016.  And though many details about the project remain behind a non-disclosure agreement, Distributed Lab founder Pavel Kravchenko confirmed to CoinDesk that his company is working with the central bank to explore moving ""e-money on a blockchain.""  As for Sulzhyk, he doubled-down on his previously stated skepticism about cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, comparing them to failed incarnations of the U.S. Federal Reserve.  But he further elaborated on the potential value to central banks of future cryptocurrencies that could eventually incorporate ""a read-only key for a blockchain,"" giving them the ability to monitor transactions ""in real-time.""  ""Once central banks understand this,"" he said, ""I think they will start moving in that direction because it gives them better visibility into the financial system.""  TokenD  So far, the most mature of Distributed Lab's efforts is TokenD, a framework for helping groups of enterprises digitize assets. Sulzhyk calls the framework an ""Oracle-like product for blockchain,"" comparing it to the large cloud platform provider that's also exploring blockchain.  In addition to including a codebase for building systems that convert traditional assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, the TokenD framework consists of a list of best practices and security and quality standards.  One early effort Sulzhyk is exploring on the topic is with the CEO of Ukraine's national depository, Mindaugas Bakas, in which the standards are being used to overcome legal concerns about issuing assets on a blockchain.  Among the other projects in the works using TokenD is the soon-to-be-announced BullionCoin, registered with the Financial Services Authority in the Isle of Man.  Going forward, Sulzhyk said Distributed Lab is exploring business models other than transaction fees, such as charging per solution or extended support services – and it's here where he's perhaps most excited about the company's path to market.  He concluded:  ""This is a fundamental game changer.""

42428134,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL61Zh,1511180122,Rally Fatigue? Low Bitcoin Volumes Could Cap Upside,"Bitcoin prices are at their highest ever, but there may be a chink in the cryptocurrency's armor.  Just a week ago, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate hit lows near $5,500. Then, by Friday, prices were flirting with fresh record highs around the $8,000 mark.  With bid tone remaining intact over the weekend, bitcoin rose to an all-time high of $8,101.91 around 20:00 UTC yesterday, as per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  However, while the $2,500 rally is impressive, data from CoinMarketCap indicates the move higher from $7,853 (Nov. 17 open price) lacks substance, as trading volumes have steadily declined over the last three days.  Struggling volumes  The above chart shows:  A clear divergence between the rising prices and trading volumes. Volumes did pick up after Nov. 14, but topped out two days later. Meanwhile, prices continue to rise and clocked record highs yesterday.  Furthermore, trading volumes have stayed well below the Nov. 12 high throughout the $2,500 rally from the recent lows near $5,500.  A low volume rally is not necessarily an ominous sign, but could be an indication of overstretched valuations: i.e. investors are reluctant to invest fresh capital above $7,800 levels. Further, the Google search volumes have seen an anemic rise, perhaps validating that argument.  So, should we expect a corrective pullback?  The technical charts favor further upside in prices, but signal the potential for a pullback to $7,300 levels if prices break below $7,900 today.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $8,035 levels. As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has added 3.4 percent in the last 24 hours.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows:  Bull flag breakout  Bullish 50-MA and 100-MA crossover  The relative strength is beginning to curl up again, but stands very close to the overbought region.  Bull flags (named for their ""flag and pole""appearance) occur during strong uptrends. They are a bullish continuation pattern: i.e. an upside break signals resumption of the rally.  On the chart above, an upside break/bull flag breakout has been confirmed, meaning the doors are open for a rally to $10,393 (target as per the measured height method: i.e. pole height added to breakout point).  However, as mentioned above, the breakout lacks substance due to dropping volumes. Additionally, bitcoin is already at record highs and overbought as per the weekly and monthly RSI.  View  The signs of bull market exhaustion detailed above indicate heightened odds of a corrective pullback. A break below $7,900 would open doors for a drop to $7,200 (10-day MA).  On the other hand, a move above $8,100, if accompanied by a pick-up in volumes today, would validate the bull flag breakout and could yield a rally to $10,000 levels over the next week or two.

42428115,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL60xh,1511168406,TGEs or ICBMs? Words Might Not Matter for ICOs,"Initial coin offering (ICO) may be the hottest term in cryptocurrency, but some startups are less than enthusiastic about embracing it.  Far from being able to cash in on its marketing value, many are instead seeking to buck the categorization altogether. Their chief concern? Worries that the language brings undue attention from regulators.  So, in an effort to stay under the radar, the entrepreneurs running these offerings have begun changing the language, sometimes only slightly. ""Initial token offering,"" ""token sale,"" ""token generation event"" or ""initial capital building mechanism"" or ""ICBM"" (an acronym more commonly thought of as a delivery mechanism for nuclear bombs) have all cropped up of late.  Amidst this inconsistency, CoinDesk took the topic to the floor of the ICO Forward Summit in New York City last week. The event brought together token projects, interested investors and existing blockchain companies to talk about the use case, its promise and possible pitfalls.  And while there might not be consensus on the issue, those CoinDesk spoke to believe the language is a natural symptom of regulatory tip-toeing.  According to Matt McKibbin, of the blockchain industry consultancy DecentraNet, the rhetorical positioning is just growing pains.  He told CoinDesk:  ""I think the industry is still very, very young. Obviously, the lawyers still have a great amount of say in what their thing is called.""  'If you say ICO'  In this way, McKibbin argued the decision of whether to use the word ""token"" or ""coin"" seems like one coming directly from attorneys. In fact, speaking with many entrepreneurs with ICOs on their roadmap, it almost sounded as though they were reading off a memo from counsel as we spoke.  ""I think the language holds a lot of power in informing the audience of what you're doing,"" said Nick McEvily of Current, a project looking to roll various kinds of streaming media into one application.  Perhaps unsurprisingly given his attendance, he also plans to do a token sale in a couple months, but he's thinking about his positioning of the idea carefully.  McEvily continued:  ""If you say 'ICO,' people perceive that as an investment opportunity.""  And that's what many of these companies want to avoid, because as an investment opportunity, those tokens and in turn the companies or projects, would fall under a complex regulatory structure.  Currently, the in thing to do is sticking to the term ""token sale"" to ""avoid scrutiny from regulators,"" McEvily said.  Max Niebylski, CEO of Gladius, which will run a month-long token sale starting later this month, agreed, saying, ""It’s important to distance yourself from selling securities.""  Tricking regulators?  But will regulators really be led off a startup's scent because of word choice?  During an on-stage discussion Nick Morgan, an attorney at Paul Hastings LLP and a former SEC staffer said it isn't worth fighting the securities classification.  ""Don't spend all your time trying to figure out how you can be characterized as not being a security,"" he said. ""Assume you're a security.""  Morgan points to the SEC's outlining of its thoughts on The DAO, saying that while he does not necessarily agree with the interpretation, he thinks many token issuers should start thinking of themselves as securities providers.  In fact, again and again, panelists and speakers referred to recent remarks by the SEC chair suggesting that nearly all ICOs could qualify as securities.  ""There are a lot of regulatory issues,"" Marshal Shichtman, a securities attorney, told CoinDesk. And he didn't think the phrase a project used to describe their coin would sway regulators.  He said:  ""I don't think they care if they call it a tomato.""  Confusing the public?  And all this raises the question of whether these different terms are doing any good or whether they're simply confusing potential supporters and a public that barely understands the industry.  According to Robert MacInnis of ActiveAether, a company which will offer a ""FogCoin"" token later this month to power a system for paying devices to do cloud computing, flipping between words is a problem.  Although, he also thinks what businesses decide to call their fundraising project is a trade-off between accuracy and effective marketing.  Gladius' Niebylski, on the other hand, thinks it’s too soon to really worry about the public.  For now, the crypto community is small, he argued, and everyone in it understands what the startups are doing, no matter what phrase they use.  But others, like McKibbin, think the term that was given to the industry during its inception will stick, no matter how hard the industry tries to cleanse itself of it.  He concluded:  ""I think 'ICO' will forever be a term.""

The survey was conducted earlier this month by New York-based Triad as well as Datatrek Research, garnering responses from 317 institutional traders. Of those, just over half work for buy-side firms, with roughly 10 percent and 8 percent coming from sell-side and service provider companies, respectively.  The results of the poll showed that over 39 percent of respondents indicated that they think ""this is a bubble - it must crash."" Twenty-seven percent said they think the price of bitcoin will continue to rise – albeit more slowly compared to recent moves – while about 16 percent struck a more bullish tone, calling for a doubling of the price within the next six months. Seventeen percent didn't offer an opinion on the topic.  That divided take was on further display in the data, as some 31 percent of respondents reported that they had actually purchased some bitcoin. An additional 36 percent said they have considered it purchasing some but haven't yet, while 30 percent said ""no, never,"" according to Triad. About one-and-a-half percent of respondents indicated that they are unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies.  The data was drawn from a group that skewed heavily toward those over the age of 35, with more than half of those involved reporting that they were above 45 years or older. Roughly 20 percent of the respondents were 34 or younger.  Iffy on ICOs  Several of the survey questions pertained to initial coin offerings (ICOs), or sales of cryptographic data that can be used to bootstrap a new blockchain network.  As might be expected, relatively few of respondents – about 8 percent – said they have invested in token sales.  That said, 29 percent said they ""have considered investing in them,"" though another 15 percent indicated that they would only do so in the event additional regulation comes into play.  The survey also offered some details on the factors that institutional traders would consider before investing in an ICO. When asked to choose three from a list of possible top considerations, respondents prioritized ""founders/key employees"", ""total addressable market"" and the overall type of token.

42428124,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL61Hh,1511157635,FUD on All Sides: In Defense of CME's Bitcoin Plan,"William Mallers, Jr. started First American Discount Corporation with his father in 1984, eventually building it into the third-largest discount futures brokerage. He sold it in 2001 to Man Financial and then retired.  In this opinion piece, Mallers argues CME Group's plan to offer bitcoin futures will benefit the futures trading industry and the bitcoin community alike – notwithstanding hand-wringing in both worlds about the idea.      I'm a member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. I've also been a bitcoiner since 2013. So, when CME Group announced its intention to launch bitcoin futures in the coming weeks, I thought, ""Great! Way to go, CME.""  The first exchange to offer a futures contract on bitcoin is good news for my CME friends: more trading volume and speculative opportunities. And it's also good for my bitcoin friends: the legitimacy and access is sure to help with adoption and higher bitcoin prices. Win-win! Right?  Well, that wasn't quite the response I got.  Instead I heard just about every negative stereotype about both futures trading and bitcoin, from both communities. Let's try to put these misperceptions to rest.  'Tulips' in 5, 4, 3...  First, there’s this from the futures industry’s most widely read blog, John Lothian News:  ""The risk of bitcoin is in its history and the cloud surrounding its creation and early fraudulent days. Who is Satoshi? Where is he today? What happened at Mt. Gox? Is it still used to launder money? Why won't China let people trade bitcoin and what does this have to do with money laundering or capital controls?""  Good Lord. If you've been in enough arguments with bitcoin skeptics you know what's coming after the drug-dealing, money-laundering slam, right? Next up: the tulip-bulb analogy.  Sure enough, Lothian says, ""I don’t want to be on the wrong side of history. But the history I am looking at is … 1636-37. That was the peak of tulipmania.""  And that, my friends, is why I spent my first two years in bitcoin not sharing my passion with any non-bitcoiners. ""Bitcoin? Never heard of it.""  But because I have benefited from all the hard work that others have done to advance this project – hosting meetups, dispelling misinformation – and all I've done is log into my account and click ""Buy,"" I thought I'd try to do my part.  A margin clerk's dream  Here's what I wrote to Lothian (a former employee at the futures brokerage I ran), and maybe it will help you with your bitcoin futures doubters:  ""Hey John, it's Junior from your old FADC [First American Discount Corporation] days and I’ll be glad to help you understand bitcoin.  ""But first – recall how you used to try to collect margin money by first asking the customer to provide a contact at his bank who could confirm that he had sufficient funds in his account and that he had initiated the wire. Why did we have you do that? Because we knew we wouldn’t get the money until the next day; his bank, while debiting his account immediately, would wait until the end of the day to wire us the money (unless he stopped the wire) and our bank wouldn’t credit us until mid-morning the next day, at the earliest.  ""Now, imagine, instead of that 24-hour headache, your under-margined customer simply waved his cell phone at our FADC QR code and we got the money within 10 minutes, or at most a few hours. Bitcoin is a margin clerk's dream come true: near-instant peer-to-peer value transfer! It's easy to see why Jamie Dimon doesn’t like it, but a former margin clerk? You should be loving this technology and cheering for its adoption!  ""I know having an asset protected by the computing power of a globally distributed network doesn't feel as secure as having armed guards protecting a bank vault, but if you get some time, there are websites that estimate the cost of amassing enough computing power to defraud the bitcoin network. This site estimates about $1 billion in electricity per day, plus over $1 billion in equipment, to counterfeit one transaction. In other words, it would be way cheaper for the Hunt brothers to corner today’s silver market than it would be for me to con an online retailer like Overstock into sending me free patio furniture. It's called a '51% attack' because I’d need to control a majority of the network hashing power to get a consensus mechanism to accept my phony accounting.  ""Bernie Madoff-style cons are hard to pull off; I need years to earn my victims' trust, I have to get a reputable accounting firm to bless my forged statements, etc ... but Madoff's con was far easier than going undetected while amassing billions' worth of computing power. Plus, since new bitcoins are awarded to the miners proportionate to their computational contribution, if I did have that much computing power, I may as well amass bitcoins the honest way, right?  ""That's one of the fun insights into this project: it manages to align all participants through economic incentive.""  Overwhelming demand  When Terry Duffy, CME's CEO, says it's offering bitcoin futures in response to customer demand, I'm sure he’s right.  I know from writing brochures for commodity trading advisors that money managers want non-correlated assets. That's the only reason they own gold.  When the stock market tanks or a terrorist attack happens, that's when gold rallies. After 9/11, the stock market dropped over 7 percent, but gold spiked.  Bitcoin, like gold, is a perfect non-correlated asset to add to an investment portfolio. I am not surprised that there is such overwhelming demand for bitcoin futures from traders. Now, every trader is going to have the option to invest right there on their screen without having to do the onerous work of buying and securing bitcoin itself.  Risk controls  As for claims that CME futures trading will put the exchange at risk, they are overblown.  CME clearing privilege requires a large amount of capital. If a member's capital level drops below the threshold required to clear, the CME removes customer accounts and places them with a firm that has the capital to support them. Again, customers come first.  Stock index futures functioned as designed during the 1987 crash, grain futures likewise during the 1988 drought, currencies during the high volatility after the Plaza Accord. Consider this: prior to 1982, if you’d predicted where the most successful stock index contract would launch, you’d guess probably the New York Stock Exchange, right? But S&P 500 Index Futures launched at the Chicago exchanges next to the pork-belly pit, U.S. Treasury futures next to the soybean pit.  CME has done its homework on bitcoin; it's well aware of bitcoin's volatile price history and has the experience and controls in place to clear bitcoin futures.  Amazing, isn't it? The exchange that offers risk-management products should avoid bitcoin because it’s ""risky?"" Huh? I’ve never seen anything like bitcoin that inspires such lame arguments from its opponents.  This ain't Wall Street  Then, there's all the bitcoiners' FUD: ""Here comes Wall Street to drive the price of bitcoin down, manipulate the market and ruin it for us!""  Suffice it to say, for many of the same reasons I gave above, I don’t believe that to be true.  Keep in mind that CME is not Wall Street. The Chicago exchanges have an ethos like bitcoin's: transparency, security, independence and accountability.  To all the people hand-wringing on both sides, let's just see how this plays out. I have decades of experience with the Chicago exchanges and feel reasonably certain that you all are wasting your breath and paying too much for full-page ads in print newspapers.  Let's get this thing to the moon!  Disclosure: CME Group is an investor in CoinDesk's parent company, Digital Currency Group.

Data from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) indicates that the price climbed to $8,101.91 between 20:00 and 20:15 UTC. This move came after bitcoin – which toed the $8,000 line during Friday trading – crossed that threshold several hours earlier.  That the price of bitcoin would surge above this height was in the cards last week, as was suggested by analysis at the time. Conversely, last week saw some dramatic movements on the price front, with markets dropping below $6,000 only to recover days later. Market commentary throughout the week was led, in part, by speculation around pending futures product launches and interest among institutional investors overall.  Indeed, the move confirms a possibility floated by analysts from investment bank Goldman Sachs earlier this month. The firm's analysts have published several forecasts since earlier this year, notably predicting some of the developments seen over the summer.
