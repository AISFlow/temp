42399545,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjnKz,1485290721,How Ethereum Smart Contracts Could Replace Mining Pool Managers,"Ethereum smart contracts might one day be used to combat one of the biggest problems with cryptocurrencies at large, if a new project called SmartPool comes to fruition.  Today, nine mining pools make up roughly 75% of the bitcoin hashrate, and the situation is similar for ethereum and the rest.  Such ""mining centralization"" is seen as a potential down-the-road issue for all cryptocurrencies. The problem is that large mining pools have the potential to exert their power in ways that impact users in a negative way.  Some bitcoin developers even think that the threat is so severe that they have discussed developing an emergency hard fork to change the mining algorithm. The alternative code, if deployed, would render current mining pools useless.  While many are wary of using the hard fork upgrading mechanism in other circumstances if all stakeholders don't agree, the strength of this idea is that it could be used to make miners wary of abusing their power.  Countering the risk  So far, the risks seem to be hypothetical, as centralization hasn’t necessarily impacted the network negatively in a conspicuous way.  But researchers like computer science PhD student Loi Luu worry that it could.  The reason mining has remained so centralized, in Luu's eyes, is that attempts to decentralize the system have yet to take off.  That's why he and a group of researchers designed SmartPool – a new decentralized mining pool that they believe could address some of the flaws that have led to slow adoption of the changes.  Although SmartPool comprises just a few proposed improvements on past decentralized mining methods, Luu and the team believe the project could bring big changes.  Luu told CoinDesk:  ”The main goal is to improve the decentralization of all the existing cryptocurrencies.”  And what is most intriguing about their approach, is that they will attempt to solve the problem with the help of ethereum smart contracts, which they say can be used to deploy decentralized mining pools on any cryptocurrency.  Transaction problem  Luu expanded on the issue of mining centralization, arguing that one problem is that most mining pools currently have a head to cut off.  Under the rules that most pools follow, mining pool operators are currently the ones who choose which transactions make it into a block, Luu explained. This is potentially a problem if a pool gets a big enough portion of bitcoin's hashing power to be able to stop certain transactions (possibly diminishing one of cryptocurrency’s main value propositions).  ""That’s why, when mining is centralized the transaction censorship threat is rather serious,"" said Luu. ""If the mining pools don’t like transactions, they can just exclude them from the blocks.""  And, beyond that, there are other ways miners could potentially influence the network, if they rack up enough of hashing power.  Decentralized mining pools could offer a more democratic process, where each miner in the mining pool creates their own set of transactions, according to Luu. This means there's less likelihood that one entity will dictate which transactions go through.  Now, the reason that miners join mining pools in the first place is to ensure that they have a reliable paycheck, but mining solo is more risky in that. Without a lot of hashing power, it’s less likely that miners will find blocks and reap the rewards.  Existing decentralized mining protocols along the lines of P2Pool try to merge the best feature of solo mining (that each individual miners chooses their own transactions) with the benefits of pooled mining (that miners can continue to pool resources).  Unpopular alternative  But even with those benefits, miners are overwhelmingly choosing centralized pools. (P2Pool is the best-known decentralized option, but it's still not exactly a popular alternative).  Even with roughly 1,008 blocks mined per week, Luu pointed out that the last block P2Pool mined was a few weeks ago.  Though other decentralized mining alternatives exist, Luu argues that it's not viable for many miners to organize in a single mining pool using P2Pool’s model. The more miners that join up, the greater the “variance” – the length of time it takes to get a reward.  ""Reducing variance is, you know, the goal of joining the pool in the first place. That’s why P2Pool is not scalable and it’s very inefficient,"" Luu said.  His hope is that SmartPool will make all the difference. And, at least, it offers another decentralized mining option on bitcoin, ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.  He further contends that there aren’t many disadvantages to SmartPool's model. Miners need to run their own full nodes on any blockchain, however, which they don't need to do in centralized pools.  Potential roadblocks  The mining centralization issue is complicated, though. Precise data isn't available, nor is the precise make-up of each mining pool, making it difficult to analyze the size of the problem.  Centralization may also be occurring in other ways. In bitcoin, for instance, mining hardware manufacturing has concentrated into the hands of fewer companies.  And, it could be telling that decentralized mining protocols haven’t seen more use.  Getblocktemplate  (GBT), first proposed for bitcoin in 2012, also gives miners a vote, so to speak, by allowing them to propose their own set of transactions for each block in a mining pool. But, not many pools are using it right now, either.  Luu guessed that one setback is that miners don’t care about being able to propose their own transactions, and they want to be able to broadcast their blocks faster, so that they don’t risk losing rewards to another pool. Another drawback, of GBT at least, is that miners must trust the pool operators for payouts, unlike in P2Pool or SmartPool.  That said, Luu was surprised that so few mining pools use it.  It’s hard to say whether SmartPool will be similarly left in the dust, but Luu plans to experiment further and has big hopes for the project.  The SmartPool team already developed a proof-of-concept and the next step is to deploy a live mining pool on the ethereum network.  From there, the hope is that it will spread to others.

The event will also feature a panel discussion on the tech will feature representatives from IBM Japan, Nippon Exchange Group and bitcoin exchange bitFlyer. Later, Hiromi Yamaoka, the director-general of the central bank’s Payment and Settlements System Department, will give closing remarks.  The Bank of Japan’s distributed ledger event comes months after it announced a new partnership with the European Central Bank, aimed at joint experimentation of distributed ledgers.

42399553,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjnRs,1485280835,Identity Startup Cambridge Blockchain Raises $1.7 Million,"Blockchain identity startup Cambridge Blockchain has raised more than $1.7m in new funding, public records show.  According to a Form D published today by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Cambridge Blockchain has raised $1,785,000 out of a total $2m, indicating that the startup's funding efforts are ongoing.  Previous SEC filings show that the startup began raising funds in March 2016. The documents show that Cambridge Blockchain had raised $635k out of a planned fundraise of $1.5m as of that month, and in a filing from last October, the startup said it had raised $1.09m out of a planned $1.8m.  It's not immediately clear if Cambridge Blockchain intends to raise additional capital past the $2m.  That fundraising process began weeks after the firm won $15k during a blockchain startup competition hosted by Santander InnoVentures, the venture arm of Banco Santander. That event was held in late January of last year.  At the time, CEO Matthew Commons emphasized his startup’s focus on identity in the context of both regulatory compliance and access to networks in which only certain users are allowed entry.  ""This is one of the most critical areas where blockchain technology needs to improve if it’s going to get out of the lab and into real enterprises,"" he told CoinDesk.

42399546,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjnLy,1485273172,Hong Kong's BitVC Adds Fees For Exchange Traders,"Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange BitVC announced an update to its trading fee policies today.  Following news from last week that the exchange would add 0.2% to both sides of domestic bitcoin trades, BitVC said it will enact the same pricing for international users as other major bitcoin exchanges including BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin.  All three exchanges previously offered both services without trading fees.  Fees on BitVC, the exchange said, will be calculated daily at 13:00 local time, and it detailed how fees would be exacted from customers and in which digital and fiat currencies.  Founded in 2014, BitVC is notably a Hong Kong-based entity originally founded to offer margin trading services. (Early users were able to borrow up to 200% of the value of their assets).  As such, the move perhaps signals that China's bitcoin exchanges will move to enforce trading fees – even in subsidiaries outside of the country. Sources close to exchanges had previously expressed a willingness to keep lower fees in these markets.  The announcement comes as the global bitcoin markets continue to adjust to the change in policies at China's three largest exchanges, three of the largest by volume in the world.  At press time, volume figures were down across all three exchanges, though the price remained largely unchanged, continuing to hover around $900 as it has in recent sessions.  Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that BitVC is owned by Huobi. This has been revised.

42399563,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjnch,1485266445,Bitcoin’s Price Unfazed as China’s Exchanges Add Fees,"Bitcoin prices have remained largely unchanged so far today, fluctuating around the $900 mark despite the adoption of trading fees by three of the ecosystem's largest exchanges.  As previously announced, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin implemented 0.2% trading fees for both buy and sell trades today, a policy change that, coupled with their recent decision to end margin trading at the request of China's central bank, seems to be making for a different market.  Market data suggests that all three bitcoin exchanges have seen a drop in volume after instituting the new pricing policy. The fees, they say, were put in place in a bid to stop market manipulation and lessen the effects of price volatility. The exchanges announced the move over the weekend.  Initiated today, the trading fees do seem to be having an impact on trading volumes, if not prices.  According to data from Bitcoinity, for example, there were roughly 4,800 trades on OKCoin between the hours of 11pm and midnight EST. In the following hour, the exchange registered just over 1,000 trades, denominated in CNY – a fall of more than 80%.  Data pulled from Bitcoinity for BTCChina also demonstrates the apparent effect the new trading fees have had on volume.  After registering more than 37,000 trades between the hours of 7 and 8pm EST, that amount had fallen to less than 1,000 between the hours of midnight and 1am EST.  Bitcoinity data wasn’t available for Huobi past 22nd January. However, according to CryptoWatch, another exchange data provider, declines in Huobi’s volume can also be seen.  Daily trade volume has fluctuated between 120k and 150k bitcoins for the past few days, yet as of press time, Huobi has reported less than 38,000 BTC in trading volume since the start of the session.  Even so, the price of bitcoin seems to have taken the fee additions in stride.  According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), the current average price is $905.35, down just 0.8% from the day’s open. CNY-denominated markets, by contrast, are up more than 6% today, trading at an average of ¥6,272, BPI data shows.  No surprises  Given that the fee change had been anticipated, traders, even those based in China, struck a mostly optimistic tone on the news.  Kong Gao, marketing manager at OTC trading firm Richfund, for example, called the new volume figures “more organic”. He framed the development as good for the bitcoin market in the long term, even if the market has to adapt to new constraints.  Likewise, trader Zhao Dong said that the new numbers were a reflection of the decline in high-frequency traders, which would impact speculators, a group he called the digital currency’s largest market.  “The real volume (people who need to use bitcoin) is 10,000 to 20,000,” he said. “Short term speculation is 10 times that.”  Given this, he predicted that China’s exchanges would soon be compelled to make further changes.  Zhao added:  “Believe me, they will lower down the rate before long.”  Stan Higgins co-authored this report.

42399558,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjnXm,1485264729,"Trust or No Trust, Traders Are Still Unsure About Ethereum Classic","The possible creation of a new investment vehicle is bringing wider attention to the lesser-known digital currency, ether classic.  Teased as a forthcoming offering from Digital Currency Group (DCG) subsidiary Grayscale Investments, the investment vehicle (tentatively named the Ethereum (ETC) Investment Trusthttps://grayscale.co/ethereum-investment-trust/) would be a first-of-its-kind product offering exposure to the blockchain-based asset.  Started as a controversial offshoot of ethereum, a blockchain platform for applications launched in 2014, ethereum classic has strived for legitimacy since it was created last summer, often in the face of criticisms that it lacks the promise of its originating project.  In interview, however, analysts suggested that the possible creation of the vehicle, if achieved, would provide investors more means of gaining exposure to ether classic, in turn bolstering demand and placing upward pressure on prices.  Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged trading firm Whaleclub, for instance, argued that the potential filing would ""without a doubt"" bolster the digital currency's standing if approved.  Zivkovski told CoinDesk:  ""A large part of price suppression for any cryptocurrency is the lack of legitimacy and a lack of 'mainstream' access, eg: investing through traditional investment instruments. DCG's Trust would provide both.""  However, among traders, Zivkovski emerged as a minority opinion on the issue.  'Much to prove'  Although ether classic has experienced recent price gains, some market analysts have warned that they could be short-lived.  Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, stated that the fund may have a hard time generating enough assets under management (AUM) to have a lasting impact on price.  ""This appears to be a classic case of 'buy the rumour, sell the news',"" he told CoinDesk. ""Future price appreciation is a function of the ability of the trust to market the fund. Unless the AUM increases dramatically in the short term, the price will fade from these levels.""  Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency hedge fund EAM, also provided a cautionary note, while noting it is a ""serious attempt"" to bolster the currency.  Other long-time detractors, like algorithmic trader Jacob Eliosoff, stressed that ethereum classic still has much to prove, given that the majority of ethereum's original developers are still working on the ethereum blockchain.  He further asserted that the investment trust would do little to boost market fundamentals, asserting that trading is being bolstered by a few large holders.  He added:  ""Whales can defend a price floor, but long-term success will require organic growth among developers and users. So far, this seems almost completely absent.""  Bullish market  Still, with the news, ether classic seems to also be retaining the momentum it has been enjoying since late last week when the trust was announced.  Overall, the digital currency's price traded between $1.37 and $1.40 yesterday, CoinMarketCap figures reveal, retaining the sharp gains it enjoyed with the news on 20th January.  That day, ether classic surged more than 20% from $1.16 to $1.40, before notching further gains over the weekend. It reached a high of $1.46 on Sunday, according to CoinMarketCap.  Prices have since pulled back from that level somewhat, but this modest decline is actually a positive sign, according to Zivkovski.  ""The subsequent pullback was purely speculative as we see it, with profit takers capitalizing on the quick rise, but failing to bring price down meaningfully,"" he said, adding:  ""That's a bullish sign for the weeks and months ahead.""

42399555,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjnTq,1485259238,Watch Out – The ICOs Are Coming,"William Mougayar is the author of ""The Business Blockchain"" and a board advisor to, and investor in, various blockchain projects and startups (see: disclosures).  In this opinion piece, Mougayar argues that, while he wants the ICO party to continue, startups need to take precautions to avoid ending up in tears at the end.  First came bitcoin, then blockchains arrived. Cryptocurrencies and decentralized protocols followed.  Now, the ICOs are coming. And the ICO funds are also arriving. And a crash will be forthcoming.  To paraphrase Clay Shirky’s famous book title, Here Comes Everybody, a moniker describing how crowds form online as quickly as wildfire.  New tokens are being listed every week. Dozens of startups are planning their ICOs, and funds that specialize in these tokens are feeding the investment and speculation frenzy. Even websites offer out-the-box services with which to create, promote, run and list your ICO, describing the process to being as easy as microwave cooking.  The regulators are watching, mostly without taking harmful actions (so far), which is interpreted positively by startups who would rather ask for forgiveness than permission. Let’s do more. The door is open, and no one is shutting it.  Companies behind these ICOs are promising the moon and the stars, putting out polished websites, white papers, advisory boards, Slack channels, GitHubs, peppering with some legalese language, and topping it with the full dressing support enchilada they can think of – all in order to appear as legitimate, as hard-working, as smart and as credible as possible.  Don’t get me wrong. ICOs are a good alternative funding model that holds an exciting promise, as I’ve explained in ""How Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain-based Startups Are Turning The Traditional Venture Capital Model on Its Head"", in addition to outlining some steps and criteria on how to evaluate them.  But I see some issues with the current environment.  Startup diligence is pretty light  Diligence is tilted towards appearances, parabolic claims, white papers, a minimum of legal and lots of online dressing-up. There is relatively little involvement from traditional venture capitalists who typically dispense startup investment. VCs aren’t always right, and granted their model is being disrupted by the ICOs, but they generally have a sense about startups anatomies.  Previously, you were funded because your ideas, teams and initial product progress were worthy of it, at least someone thought so. Now, companies publish a paper making the case for their idea, open some docs for reviews, and ask for money in return for a promise to deliver something maybe in one or two years, that may or may not be accepted by the market.  Along the way, they drag a crowd of investors who buy into it, without necessarily being well informed, nor having used the product. During that process, there isn’t much talk about execution abilities, operational experience, or the rest of the team that will end-up being hired. Much of the analysis is on the surface, often tough to prove or disprove, in part due to a rushing and artificial urgency.  The three typical characteristics, team, product and market seem to have taken a secondary position to the three new magical words: tokens, blockchain and decentralization.  Token utility linkage is not always there  The assumption that everything with a potential network effect is going to work with a decentralization starting point is not entirely true. The blockchain is not for everything.  The solution or product being developed needs to have a solid business model linkage that has a particular value when decentralization and/or tokenization of actions take place. The promise of a new model needs to be very compelling.  In the name of decentralization, the promises are big. You can’t just slap a token to anything, and expect magic to happen.  The token is not the business model. The value proposition or utility that is enabled by the token is the business model, and that linkage needs to be there early on. If the direction is not right, the chosen path will not lead to a good place.  The marketing hype is frightening  Some ICOs are being marketed like a rocket ship, but in reality, no startup is a rocket ship. A lot of the communication is biased towards the most optimistic assumptions, but nothing goes up in a straight line.  With an ICO, three asynchronous periods seem to have blurred and collapsed into one: early stage, go-to market, product-to-market fit. Just because it makes sense in theory, doesn’t mean that it will make sense when the market realities enter the picture.  True that some level of speculatory fever can help to fund projects and give them a longer runway life, but if the expectations get far ahead of reality, the gaps may be harder to bridge, resulting in a downward spiral snap.  For good or bad reasons, raising lots of money can hide a lot of mistakes along the way, and there is some of that going on.  Financial engineering has its traps  A rule of thumb for many ICOs has been to allocate 85% of the tokens to the market, and keep 15% for developers and company, but this is a risky ratio. It is equivalent to raising all your funding at once. In the best cases, companies assume that the token will go up in price, which would enable the company (or protocol operator) to never need to raise money again. But not every company is like bitcoin or ethereum, just as not every startup is like Facebook or Twitter.  Of course, a smart company would not release more funding to itself until milestones are reached, but few will exercise that type of discipline. Fewer ICOs make a provision for subsequent funding events beyond the ICO.  All in all, funding a startup is not a one-shot deal. Too much financial engineering is just that. I would urge anyone planning an ICO to re-read the excellent ""Security Laws Framework for Blockchain Tokens"" paper, especially the appendix.  ICO success doesn’t equate to company success  Success means many users with continuous engagement, steady ecosystem activity, visible benefits from the service or product, and some early revenues or wealth creation to prove that the product-to-market fit alignment is working.  All of these take time and several steps along the way that typically happen gradually and commensurably. No startup ever nails everything from the first go. Iterations and evolutions are the norm, and ICO companies need to be realistic about it.  The best ICOs will be the ones where users have a stake in the future of the business, and where their actions does something to increase the value of the network or underlying business. For example, token holders can be direct participants as users of the product or service. That is the ultimate incentivized setup (assuming that the service is bonafide valuable), in addition to figuring out the circular economy aspects of the business model.  The legal grounds are still shaky  Despite appearances of success in circumventing legal or regulatory hurdles, some practices just don’t make sense.  Why are tokens allowed to trade before the protocol or product is even out in the marketplace? Heightening expectations with the hope that token prices rise months and years ahead of going to market can only go so far before the regulators start raising their eyebrows on that practice.  Not all companies can survive the price fluctuations, volatility and speculative waves that will be expected when there is nothing but speculation and trading that drives your token price. Look at the volatility of BTC, ETH and STEEM, and these are examples with actual products that work and have thousands of users.  Still, too many regulatory unknowns remain:  Will there be a cap on total amounts being raised? Will there be tighter overall compliance requirements? Will tokens be allowed to trade, ahead of product availability? Are reporting or audit requirements likely to be enforced? Are reasonable vesting and liquidity requirements likely to be mandated?  The irony about listing tokens too early is that now consumers who trade them can lose their money many times over (via multiple trades), not just once via a buy-and-hold pattern.  It’s too early to play the hedge fund game  Most hedge funds are clueless in terms of business insights and experience with picking startups and working with them. Speculating on uncertain instruments is like turbocharging a car that is already headed into a ditch. The accident will happen faster.  Hedge funds act based on what they are fed in a prospectus offering, or by their superficial understanding of a company’s prospects, let alone the market surrounding it. They optimize their operations around quantitative analytics, trading prowess, and recently machine learning or AI-supported decision-making.  Some are gaming the initial buying of tokens with automated wallet crawlers and other mischievous tools that allow them to automatically grab tokens early (by beating the average buyer), and subsequently claim a “gain” a few hours later.  Some funds are being aggressively marketed based on these short-term exploits and paper profits about ICOs that aren’t even operational yet. The fund’s relationship with the ICO founders is mostly transactional.  Smart founders are better served with smart money or benign crowds as influential points to their destiny, and they should not let funds that have been set up for trading purposes to take large positions in their token distribution.  ICOs should attract partner-funders that can help them, and not be at the mercy of those can trade them and pump them, because they will later dump them at their own will. If you are familiar with the over-the-counter penny stock environment and the ongoing need to promote stocks with press releases and superficial announcements, we are in this territory.  The type of diligence that funds undertake on a token offering is not the same as the diligence that is needed on a company, idea, or product.  Most funds are going to feed the speculative train without caring (or knowing) about the real underlying business. Funds that focus on cryptocurrency trading could become that artificial destabilizer and the tipping point for a subsequent crash that eventually will bring us back to reality.  Crashing the party or priming a launch  Yes, I want the ICO party to continue, but I’m seeing participants that are just there for the ride. I’m seeing companies and ideas getting ICO-funded on a wing-and-prayer chance of being successful. Some others who have even previously failed to raise in private circles, are now opting for the ICO route.  As I said earlier, here comes everybody. When the party gets overcrowded and unwanted visitors want it louder and bigger, events can turn to the unpredictable.  In technology, nothing great is often achieved without irrational exuberance, but when the pendulum swings too far, there will some damage. In the long term, we hope that benefits far outweigh the pitfalls that are encountered along the way, and maybe that is the only way that good things happen.  ICOs are supposed to be like an IPO with a cryptocurrency, but in reality, these are early-stage funding bets. Most of these companies won’t stand the scrutiny of public markets (which they entered, whether they like it or not), while they wished they had the private lives of early stage startups.  An ICO is the beginning and the means to an end, not the end itself. The ICO is not the great enabler of business models and incredible innovation. The blockchain is. An ICO is an alternative funding, operational and ownership model. You still need to bolt a sound business to it. You don’t get a pass there, and you need to get a few things right.  Take everything with a grain of salt, two pinches of hype, and three sprinklings of wishful thinking.

Using the Hyperledger Fabric project’s code as a basis, the firm is seeking patent approval for its transfer solution, it announced today.  According to Deutsche Börse, the next step will include working with clients, as well as regulatory and central banking contacts, to continue to fine-tune the project.  The firm described the CollCo functionality, saying:  “All peer-to-peer payments based on tokenised commercial bank money are accompanied by movements of collateral between the respective Eurex Clearing members using the [central counter party's] functionality and rules.""  It went on to say that the project addresses ""existing and potential new use cases"", including the ""handling of margining requirements, credit risk free payments, and delivery-versus-payment asset/value transfer on the blockchain"".  The market operator has spent much of the past year experimenting with various blockchain use cases, including one in partnership with Germany’s central bank. Last February, the firm took part in New York blockchain startup Digital Asset Holding’s $60m funding round, while at the same time joining its board of directors.  The development comes as Deutsche Börse spelled out its plans for the future.  During a speech given last week, CEO Carsten Kengeter spoke about the move toward the so-called “Exchange 4.0” powered by next-generation technologies.  “Exchange 4.0 will use blockchain intelligently. Exchange 4.0 will convert data into investment tools,” Kengeter told attendees. “Finally, Exchange 4.0 will be as varied – and perhaps also as easy to use – as an app store.”  Image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/01/24/deutsche-borse-unveils-bank-transfer-blockchain-project,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9009403ec2552c90da680690b2e1c789777b4412-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
