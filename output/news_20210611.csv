42406559,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAevAb7,1623450392,"South Koreans Can Pay With Bitcoin in Stacks, Paycoin Integration","Stacks is partnering with South Korean e-commerce protocol Paycoinhttps://payprotocol.io/index_eng.html to support transactions with its currency STX.    This integration means merchants who accommodate Paycoin will soon accept STX and bitcoin as methods of payment, the Stacks Foundation, which builds apps on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, announced. Businesses that accept Paycoin, such as Domino’s Pizza, KFC and 7-Eleven, will allow for customers to transact in these cryptocurrencies.      There are 1 million users of the Paycoin application and 70,000 businesses that accept this cryptocurrency.      Users can hold STX and collect returns in bitcoin within the application, Stacks said in its release. This encourages users to transact in STX in order to gain rewards in digital currency to continue spending in the app.      The partnership of Paycoin and STX will allow for businesses and consumers to use cryptocurrency every day, according to the Paycoin Blog. All transactions will take place within the Paycoin application. This compartmentalized process allows for greater ease of digital currency transactions, which for some has hindered participation in blockchain technologies.      Paycoin is a blockchain payment project with the goal of high efficiency transactions for businesses and consumers. It is a subsidiary of Danal Fintech, a South Korean company specializing in mobile commerce solutions.      According to Mitchell Cuevas, head of growth at the Stacks Foundation, the integration will entice business owners to accept Paycoin because it will reduce “friction with the preloaded wallet.” He claims there is a “gravitation towards holding money in a place to participate in the upside of assets,” such as bitcoin returns on STX holdings.      When compared to South Korean stablecoin terra, which has proved successful in the nation, STX and Paycoin are far more volatile. According to Cuevas, their respective usages depend on “the level to which the user is risk averse.”      “Korea is one of the most heavily regulated crypto markets,” he said, and that substantial trust in coins is essential to the success of the integration.      “What is important in these markets is utility, things you can spend [STX] on, not just a black box that sits in a wallet,” he said.",POSITIVE,STX,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | STX,Cameron Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/11/south-koreans-can-pay-with-bitcoin-in-stacks-paycoin-integration,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/431b32339733574c5def8185ad6ebeacb5e3a04c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,377-$2,492 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin sentiment mixed    Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Friday by 2.3% as of press time. The price was above the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour, a bullish signal for market technicians.      The price of bitcoin climbed from $36,038 at 01:30 UTC (9:30 p.m. ET Thursday) to $37,536 by 11:45 UTC (7:45 a.m. ET) Friday, a 4.1% gain on some rocky trading patterns, based on CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin then lost a bit and is at $37,275 as of press time.    Relatively stable    A 4% price ride for bitcoin Friday is actually relatively stable for the asset, which can often see double-digit gyrations on weekdays. Constantin Kogan, a crypto investor and founder of investment community BullPerks, believes the recent mix of news developments is leaving traders without a true market direction.      “Speculators are fighting,” Kogan said. “China pulls the market down but the rest of the world is actually bringing more positive sentiment.” Concerns from China, including Asia-centric Binance losing USD access via Silvergate Bank’s network, are getting offset by El Salvador’s adoption of crypto, described by a Bank of International Settlements official as an “interesting experiment.”    Bitcoin’s volume resurgence    Over the past month, there were 18 days where ether’s daily trading volume surpassed bitcoin’s. However, on Wednesday and Thursday this week, BTC returned to the top. On Thursday, bitcoin’s trading volume was at $43 billion total on spot exchanges, 26% higher than ether’s $33 billion.      David Russell, vice president of market intelligence at brokerage TradeStation Group, says it’s hard for the crypto market to ignore bitcoin as the long-term bellwether.      “Investors putting the marginal dollars to work are favoring bitcoin,” Russell said. “Additionally, altcoins like ether typically perform best after bitcoin has rallied. Strength in crypto often focuses on the biggest name.“      Read More: BlockFi Retail Account Balance Increased Fivefold in Past Year, CEO Says    Ether slips as derivatives go quiet    Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading around $2,397 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), losing 1.8% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour, a bearish indicator for market technicians.      Ether slipped from $2,492 at 23:00 UTC (7:00 p.m. ET) Thursday to $2,377 by 16:40 UTC (12:40 p.m. ET) Friday, a 4.6% up-and-down pattern, based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH has trended upward a bit, at $2,397 as of press time.      Greg Magadini, chief executive officer of options data analytics firm Genesis Volatility, has noticed a change in the derivatives market that may mean ether and bitcoin will see downside or sideways conditions in the short term.      “In the past 72 hours we've seen huge drops in implied volatility for both BTC and ETH,” Magadini noted.      Indeed, Genesis’s ""Shadow Term Structure"" chart, which shows the path of implied volatility based on future strikes, is dropping the further away the date. Implied volatility is a market's forecast of a likely movement in a security's price.      “It means that the options markets are expecting rangebound crypto prices for a while,” Magadini said. “We can expect this lull in activity to hold until we trade out of $30,000-$40,000 for bitcoin, and $2,000-$3,000 for ether.”    DEX volumes dumping    After exceeding $12 billion in trading volume on decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, May 19, the amount of crypto changing hands on these venues fell to below $2 billion by June 6. DEXs utilize the Ethereum network to conduct transactions.      Ether remains well off the record price of $4,382.73 reached May 11, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      “Bitcoin has had some positive catalysts this week, like the El Salvador decision [to make bitcoin legal tender] and Jack Dorsey suggesting Twitter may support the Lightning Network,” said TradeStation’s Russell. “Nothing as dramatic has materialized for ethereum, which was already trading near long-term highs versus bitcoin.”      Exhaustion for ETH and refocus on BTC may be one symptom for declining DEX volumes because that market is focused on ether and altcoins, noted Elie Le Rest, partner at quant firm ExoAlpha.      “It’s a return to the mean of ETH/BTC after a bullish phase,” Le Rest told CoinDesk. “If BTC resumes its bull run by breaking $40,000 it could also continue to power the growth of ETH and fill up volume to reach new highs.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly lower Friday.

42406555,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAevAWC,1623438340,New York Crypto Mining Bill Dies in Assembly After Passing State Senate,"The New York State Assembly failed to pass an environmental protection bill that would have clamped down on new and expanding bitcoin mining operations.    Sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CoinDesk that opposition from union groups, specifically the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, led to the bill's demise. The bill died Thursday with the closing of the current legislative session.  While supporting the environmental goals, the union said the bill would ""prohibit a business based upon whether it obtains its power from a generator behind the meter versus from the grid and targets the use of a specific technology,” according to a letter opposing the measure from IBEW Legislative Counsel Addie A.E. Jenne.  The original bill proposed in the New York State Legislature by Sen. Kevin S. Parker (D-Brooklyn) would have enacted a freeze on new mining endeavors in accordance with the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act of 2019.  A modified version passed the state Senate earlier this week.  If passed, the bill would have required scrutiny of the environmental impact of current mining operations in the state.  The bill was proposed at a time when an inactive coal plant in upstate New York was recommissioned as a plant fueling Greenidge Generation’s mining apparatuses with 19 megawatts of natural gas.  Although environmental goals are at stake with the bill’s failure to pass, profitable mining plants such as Greenidge have increasingly been making commitments to a future of carbon neutral mining.

42406568,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAevAi0,1623437429,Was Bitcoin Miami a COVID Superspreader Event? Too Early to Say,"The evidence remains anecdotal that last weekend's Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami resulted in a significant number of COVID-19 infections.      Many other attendees may have caught the common cold.      According to the testimony of many attendees who were there, including CoinDesk's own staff, it was an event of many packed rooms, little masking and what appears to have been a subset of unvaccinated participants.      ""Went to #Bitcoin Miami. According to my @ouraring, I’m averaging about 5.5 hrs of sleep over the last 10 days (not the best for immunity),"" Twitter user Jeff Jagoe tweeted. ""Haven’t got a test because I feel great.""      ""Attended, had access everywhere, spoke to hundreds,"" Bitcoin core admin Alex Lawn tweeted. He added that he ""had very little sleep and probably not enough food so immune system should be lower. I'm still in Miami and personally [know no one who] became ill attending.""    Additional reporting    CoinDesk reached out to its network in the crypto community to ask what people knew about participants who came back with COVID-19 infections, the prevalence of vaccinations and of testing following the conference.      Crypto investor Eric Wall appears to have been beset by one of the more serious cases, tweeting Thursday that he had ""Just tested positive for COVID"" and sharing a photo of himself in an ambulance or hospital attached to medical equipment.      It should be obvious that CoinDesk doesn't have a way to independently verify any of these claims, nor has prior reporting on COVID-19 at Bitcoin 2021 shown any evidence of seeking verification. All findings up to this point are largely circumstantial and suspect.      Respondents to CoinDesk's inquiries asked to remain nameless because it's a story pertaining to personal health.      One staffer at a Bitcoin mining startup told CoinDesk he knew of one person in their travel group who came back with a positive test.      ""It seems most people who went to the conference itself were fine. People who went to the clubs, not so much,"" this person said via text message. ""Seems to be also people infecting coworkers rather than attendees affecting each other.""      By and large, most respondents to CoinDesk's inquiries indicated that they had gone to Miami fully vaccinated, it should be noted.      Another entrepreneur in the industry traveled in a small group and said two unvaccinated members of the group came back with a positive COVID-19 test, neither of whom were vaccinated. The entire group is feeling sick, however. The respondent was fully vaccinated.      A spokesperson for a payments startup indicated that many of the team members were feeling ill as well, but no one had any positive COVID-19 tests so far.    It came from social media    The discussion seems to have begun when Arcane Assets' Eric Wall indicated on Twitter that he had come back with a positive test (he has since made his account private). Subsequently Luke Martin, creator of CoinistBot, said he had a positive test, but that tweet has since been deleted. An anonymous crypto trader named @cryptokaleo also wrote about having a positive test.      ""Knowing that I would get it would I go back and do the same thing again? 100%. Honestly the average cold I get is worse than this,"" the account wrote.      It should be noted that since the claim can't be verified and it's from an pseudonymous account, this could simply be a post intended to provoke a response. That said, there are posts on that feed that seem to come from the Miami event in early June.      Some respondents raised questions about whether an infection that occurred in early June would show up so quickly in a test.      CoinDesk contacted the Florida Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to find out if they were tracking people who participated in Bitcoin 2021 but has not received responses as of press time.

42406572,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAevAlw,1623432353,Money Reimagined: Bitcoin's Green Savior?,"Well, the giant Bitcoin Miami love fest conference turned out to be more than just late-night beach parties. It actually delivered some news – a bombshell announcement big enough to quell concerns about the event being a COVID-19 superspreader event. All week, the crypto world has been alight with the news that the Central American country of El Salvador will become the first nation to treat bitcoin as legal tender.      The implications of that announcement dominate this week’s newsletter. In particular, the main column focuses on the prospect of also spurring renewable energy development across the country via a system of bitcoin-funded community microgrids.      The accompanying “Money Reimagined” podcast departs from an otherwise all-bitcoin newsletter to explore the second edition of Sheila Warren’s and my dive into the governance challenges and opportunities for new forms of organizational decision-making posed by decentralized finance (DeFi) and distributed autonomous organizations (DAOs).      Have a listen after you read the newsletter.    Bitcoin and green energy: El Salvador’s leapfrog chance    Possibly the only thing this week that got bitcoiners more excited than El Salvador President Nayib Bukele’s move to make bitcoin legal tender was his followup that bitcoin miners will get access to geothermal power from volcanoes.      The bitcoin community is not only celebrating a new Central American haven but pointing to El Salvador as a proving ground for “green” bitcoin. Because geothermal plants draw their energy from an existing, naturally occurring heat, their carbon footprint is minimal.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    But I think El Salvador (population 6.4 million), one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, has an opportunity to make a far more groundbreaking energy play than the buzz generated by linking a volcano to a bitcoin mine.      A humble proposal: The government should work with miners, local community leaders and foreign investors to strategically fund the expansion of the country’s electricity coverage, specifically via a decentralized network of cheap, clean, cyber-secure, and community-empowering solar or wind-power microgrids.      The best way to overturn the flawed narrative – most recently furthered by U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren – that bitcoin will destroy the planet if we don’t curtail it is to demonstrate the opposite: that miners prefer low-cost green sources of power and that they can be a force multiplier for green energy infrastructure at large. If executed properly, El Salvador’s bitcoin project could achieve a host of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in one shot. That’s a story I’d love to tell.    Underwriting green economic development    While Warren, Elon Musk and others have been beating the drum about Bitcoin’s energy usage exceeding Sweden’s, bitcoin mines are being deployed in multiple locations across the world, not only to tap existing renewable or stranded energy sources such as wasted natural gas destined for flaring, but to underwrite the development of green electricity infrastructure to serve wider communities.      In a recent episode of our “Money Reimagined'' podcast, Harry Sudock, vice president of strategy at mining infrastructure provider GRIID, told us his company is seeing relentless demand from wind, hydro and solar developers for bitcoin mining; co-locating facilities offers revenue guarantees that allow communities to expand renewables to serve local people. Without those guarantees, these enterprises tend to stall because they depend on bureaucratically administered and sparsely distributed government subsidies to fund their rollout.      In other words, bitcoin mining can serve as that missing piece of risk capital needed to kick-start infrastructure projects, not only to shift the world toward renewable energy but also to foster economic development. There are deep-pocketed companies ready to do this – payments provider Square, for example, which is investing $5 million into a new bitcoin-driven solar facility run by Blockstream.      To maximize the social impact of this effort, we need to look beyond large-scale, state-run, centralized energy projects such as El Salvador’s geothermal plants and seek ways to fund community-based green power projects run as regional microgrids.      A decentralized network of such grids would provide what power experts call “redundancy,” creating multiple backups to offset the vulnerability of the centralized national grid to outages caused by weather or other disruptions. (For a sense of why centralized systems are more vulnerable, think of the tens of millions of people along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard who were impacted by a single ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline. A decentralized structure gives hackers a smaller payoff in terms of disruption.)      Most importantly, if bitcoin miners source their power from local, community-based grids, their payments for it – transferred in newly legal tender bitcoin – will go to those communities, providing a steady long-term source of income. (Ideally, microgrids would be governed as cooperatives, or even as distributed autonomous organizations, or DAOs, to ensure wide distribution of proceeds and that there is accountable reinvestment in sustainable development.)      With those funds in hand and new, more widely distributed, reliable, low-cost sources of electricity available, local entrepreneurs could, for example, build out a network of charging stations, creating the foundation for local businessmen to spin up electric vehicle transport services. There’d be power to pump water into farmers’ irrigation systems. They could expand cell phone services, which are vital for bitcoin payment apps such as Lightning-based Zap, whose CEO, Jack Mallers, was instrumental in President Bukele’s bitcoin awakening.      The geothermal mining proposal is not antithetical to this idea. Bitcoin payments to the national geothermal energy company, LaGeo, would go to upgrading and maintaining the national system into which the microgrids are integrated to provide greater security and reliability. Or, in a direct application of the so-called “money battery” concept, energy tariff payments to the government by bitcoin miners could fund the development and maintenance of the microgrids in other places.    Flip the debate    For those who believe bitcoin’s offer of a censorship-resistant, programmable, universally accessible source of digital currency is a positive force for the world, projects like this provide an opportunity to sway public opinion and get people to recognize that it can drive sustainable growth opportunities if managed properly.      We need to table the dysfunctional debate about bitcoin’s environmental impact. Critics focus on bitcoin’s energy consumption, but it’s the wrong lens. El Salvador and so many other poor countries need to consume more, not less, energy if they are to prosper. And excessive consumption is only a problem if the resource is finite, which is not the case with solar, wind or geothermal energy.      The problem is bitcoin’s mining’s source of energy. And the reality, one that too many crypto advocates ignore, is that bitcoin does access a massive amount of fossil fuel energy. Its carbon footprint is by no means small and will grow bigger as usage expands unless deliberate actions are taken to reduce it.      We need policy actions that can put both sides of this debate into a more reasonable context. El Salvador can lead the way – especially given the interest among other Latin American leaders to follow its example.      Still, to ensure the spoils of development are spread among host communities and to keep miners and grid operators in a symbiotic contractual relationship that serves the interests of both, regulation is needed. Rules can be set for minimizing mining activity during peak hours to manage the “duck curve” problem caused by unused solar capacity and for ensuring there is constant reinvestment in capacity for the community at large.      The question is, will Bukele’s government, which has been accused of authoritarianism and has resisted efforts by U.S. President Joseph Biden to expand regional anti-corruption efforts, seize the initiative to spread the wealth? Or will corrupt officials and wasteful state companies monopolize the bitcoin windfall?      Well, here’s an opportunity for the Biden Administration to strike a deal.      Deeply poor El Salvador is one of the biggest sources of undocumented immigrants crossing through Mexico into the United States. If the U.S. sees the big picture here, it should take a more positive stance towards El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy than we’re currently hearing from Washington – the U.S.-dominated International Monetary Fund expressed concerns Thursday about it. It can help the country leverage the opportunity to develop prosperity among the very communities that are sending their people on those treacherous journeys to the U.S.      This is a unique opportunity for everyone. Let’s not squander it.    Off the charts: Whither the whales?    In the first Money Reimagined newsletter of 2021, we looked at how so-called “whale” bitcoin addresses with more than 1,000 BTC had grown significantly before and during the price rally that started in mid-2020 and accelerated into the end of the year. We contrasted that with 2017, when whales started shedding positions mid-year while the price was not even a quarter of the $20,000 peak it would later hit in December, before it plummeted to levels below $8,000 in early February. We saw in this a potential sign of sustainability for the 2020 rally because it indicated that the gains were driven by big, lasting bets by institutional investors.      So, now that we’ve had a big pullback, let’s look at how whales have been behaving.      Once again, the whales led the price decline. As the chart above shows, addresses with more than 1,000 BTC increased sharply during the first two months of the year while the price of bitcoin also soared. But then, around March, whale accounts dropped sharply, as if concluding that the small, retail investors now rushing into bitcoin were once again taking things too far.      Unlike the 2017 rally/bubble, the price response came only a couple of months after the whale drawback began, whereas there was a delay of six months in 2017. Then, the price increased four-fold during that gap period whereas this year, the increase was less than 50% – still huge, but less parabolic.      To me, this speaks to how important large, institutional accounts were in this most recent rally. They were the reason for it – the founding narrative being that “the suits” are coming – even if in the latter stages it was fueled by a small investor influx. When the institutions got cold feet – primarily because of environmental concerns – the market couldn’t sustain itself.      What now, then? Well, it’s probably too early to say, but there is a small uptick in whale addresses this past month. Just as importantly, as CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported this week, even if whale addresses haven’t increased, existing addresses have been accumulating coins, adding a total of 80,000 BTC since the price crashed to $30,000 on May 19. For now, at least, the bigger players seem to see buying opportunities in these lower prices.    The Conversation: A house divided    Crypto Twitter riled up this week when U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the prominent liberal Democrat from Massachusetts, came out with a tweet and a video that described bitcoin as an “environmental disaster” and “scandalous.”      Notably, this came two days after a bitcoin put-down by someone otherwise seen as the diametric opposite of Warren: former President Donald Trump.      The differential here is that Trump’s view is based on a blatant appeal to raw state power that comes with the dollar’s dominance – a state of affairs that most fans of bitcoin seek to escape – whereas Warren’s is couched in the interests of the planet rather than nationalism.      Putting that aside, the convergence of anti-bitcoin voices from both sides of the political aisle is important. To many in the bitcoin space, it’s a galvanizing moment. It’s now all about “us” versus “them,” they say, where ”they” are the centralized establishment, Democrat or Republican, that the peer-to-peer technology of Bitcoin is intended to bypass.      Crypto Twitter exploded in angry retort. But that was to be expected. More intriguing were the pro-bitcoin responses from within “the establishment.”      First, let’s hear from Ohio Congressman Warren Davidson, a Republican who has embraced a pro-Trump stance. Davidson is a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus and he took Warren to task:      Next, a former Democratic presidential candidate who is now running for mayor of New York City. On CNBC, Andrew Yang laughed down a question about environmental concerns and struck a decidedly pro-crypto stance. (Audio a bit rough, but thanks to @SonamSSol for capturing the video.)      One measure of bitcoin’s power is its capacity to make strange bedfellows.    Relevant reads: Bitcoin’s savior?    High school Spanish question: Translate “el salvador.”      News that a country would declare bitcoin legal tender was always bound to elicit “to the moon” high fives among the cryptocurrency’s loyal community. But with the price well off its highs and concerns abounding over China’s regulatory crackdown and a backlash from environmentalists, bitcoiners had even more reason to cheer this development than ever. It’s almost as if Nayib Bukele, a bearded, baseball cap-backwards, self-styled rebel of 39 years of age has emerged as their savior – you know, in the religious sense.    As reported by Zack Seward, Colin Harper and Danny Nelson, it began at the Bitcoin Miami conference with an emotional, almost evangelical presentation by Zap CEO Jack Mallers, who shared a videotaped announcement in which Bukele told the whooping audience that “El Salvador is set to be the first bitcoin country.”  But is Bukele the Messiah bitcoin needs? Per a day-after profile by Daniel Kuhn, it’s complicated. The young, anti-establishment president eschews “left” or “right” labels, while actions such as sending in armed soldiers to the legislature and removing Supreme Court judges have seen him described as a “hipster authoritarian.” Meanwhile, in providing direct assistance to the poor during the COVID-19 pandemic, he earned sweeping approval from voters but copped the epithet of “populist” from conservatives.  Either way, Bukele has sparked what could be described as a movement – maybe even a religion – among like-minded politicians across Latin America. Legislators from Argentina, Mexico, Panama, Brazil, Colombia and Paraguay adopted pro-bitcoin “laser eyes” Twitter profiles. And Paraguayan Congressman Carlos Rejala promised to introduce a bill that would open his country’s hydropower resources to bitcoin miners. In an interview with Andreas Engler, Rejala sounded almost Pentecostal: “The [Bukele] announcement prompted me not to be afraid and to think that this can be real in my country.”  And now Rome is displeased. As anyone who has read the financial history of Latin America knows, throughout much of the past 50 years the International Monetary Fund has been an economic master to the region’s countries. In fact, in requiring them to sustain their debt commitments, it has become known among the Latin American left as a brutal taskmaster.

42406561,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAevAc6,1623427112,The Node: The Dawn of Bitcoin Geopolitics,"Boy, I chose the wrong week to stop sniffing glue go on vacation. I’ve been visiting family since last Tuesday. As joyful as that vaxxed-up post-COVID reunion has been, I sure wish it hadn’t overlapped with the most significant single development in the history of cryptocurrency so far: the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador.      Plenty of naysayers have worked to pick apart the move since its announcement and implementation over the past week, and there are certainly many unknowns. Those include the basic logistical challenge posed by exchange rates and bitcoin’s slow and expensive on-chain transactions, which El Salvador will tackle with the help of the firm Strike. Another major question is whether Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who is wildly popular but has made authoritarian moves to consolidate power, is the ideal leader to take this dizzying first step.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk chief insights columnist. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    But those details pale in comparison to the broad outlines: For the first time, a nation has adopted a currency that neither it nor any other single entity controls. This is particularly significant because El Salvador had previously used the U.S. dollar as its sole currency. The dollar will certainly still be widely used in the country, but adding bitcoin to the picture, in even a limited form, reduces the influence of the U.S. and other rich countries.      The backlash from establishment figures in the U.S. and Europe has been somewhat muted but obvious. You can absolutely smell the fear.      For instance, former President Donald Trump on Monday responded to the plan by saying: ""Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam. I don’t like it because it’s another currency competing against the dollar ... I want the dollar to be the currency of the world. That’s what I’ve always said."" Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, without referencing El Salvador directly, chose the moment to attack cryptocurrency broadly.    Read more: David Morris: The Node: Warren Versus the Volcano    The use of the dollar as a global medium of exchange and savings provides huge benefits to the U.S., and losing that dominance, whether to bitcoin or the yuan, would have major negative impacts on the U.S. domestic economy. It’s a fear that few U.S. leaders have articulated so explicitly with regard to bitcoin – but Trump, for better and worse, has a gift for saying out loud what a lot of other people are thinking.      The U.S. isn’t the only one signaling anxiety over El Salvador’s move. The International Monetary Fund chimed in Thursday morning, saying El Salvador’s plan raises “a number of macroeconomic, financial and legal issues that require very careful analysis.” This may sound anodyne enough, but when you recognize that the IMF is effectively a tool of economic coercion used by rich northern nations to bully developing countries in the global south, it takes on an ominous tone.      At the same time, bitcoin skeptics have latched on to the idea that 39-year-old Bukele is a nascent authoritarian. Bukele has indeed taken significant steps to weaken checks on his power, including firing judges and anti-corruption officials. The U.S. has also accused several of Bukele’s allies of corruption. Salvadorans nonetheless apparently adore their president, who has a steady approval rating near 90%, likely because they understand his actions in the context of El Salvador’s messy and bleak political history. At the same time, the legacy of U.S. engagement in Latin America, and in El Salvador specifically, provide plenty of reason to be skeptical of attempts to delegitimize the democratically elected president.      Let’s tackle the International Monetary Fund first. The IMF, which is dominated by advanced economies and consistently headed by Europeans, makes loans to developing countries in economic or financial crisis. Though founded with high ideals, since the 1970s the IMF has used these loans as a coercive tool to advance first-world interests as part of a neoliberal strategy that Naomi Klein termed “The Shock Doctrine.” The IMF has consistently tied its emergency loans to drastic economic “reforms” that usually amount to brutal austerity for working people and free rein for international (read: mostly American and European) corporations. It was without hyperbole that one repentant development bank operative titled his bestselling 2004 expose ""Confessions of an Economic Hitman.""    There has been fierce criticism of the IMF for more than two decadeshttps://www.mit.edu/~thistle/v13/2/imf.html, but it has stubbornly stayed the course. In 2019, when Ecuador was in a severe economic slowdown, the IMF stepped in to loan it $4.2 billion. In exchange for that truly insulting pittance, the IMF demanded “modernization” policies that included privatizing public assets, stripping worker protections and cutting public spending by 6% over three years. The IMF knew and acknowledged these spending cuts would send Ecuador into a recession, increasing unemployment and poverty.    The most recent World Bank data on Ecuador’s economy is from 2019, so it’s still unclear how things played out in this case, but one can guess intentionally triggering a recession just before the coronavirus pandemic was … not ideal.

Under the most repulsive of these provisions, the IMF even prohibited some countries from providing free education to children in the name of fiscal discipline.      The IMF argues these vampiric reforms produce long-term growth. Even if that is true, they inflict huge costs in both national sovereignty and global stability. In the most notorious example, it’s widely believed IMF bailout packages badly worsened the 1997 Asian financial crisis, because the agreements made it impossible for nations to stem short-term capital flight. (This is the version of events laid out, not in some radical political broadsheet, but in the Encyclopedia Britannica.) The contagion eventually spread as far as Brazil and Russia.      You can begin to see why the IMF might regard a developing nation’s adoption of an independent currency system as deserving of “very careful analysis,” as a spokesperson put it. For one thing, at least some of the pressure it’s able to exert on behalf of its Euro-American masters is based on their control of the global banking system, which bitcoin can bypass.      And, good heavens, let’s hope no developing nations so much as think about decentralized finance (DeFi) the next time they need a loan – that would just be awful. Remember all the hoops Ecuador jumped through for that $4.2 billion? The total capital on DeFi systems today is $59.4 billion. It is not a great leap to imagine a future in which the IMF is no longer the lender of last resort for countries in crisis. They can borrow directly from the rest of us, without submitting to destructive, anti-human “reforms.”      The question of Bukele’s authoritarianism is much less clear-cut. Some of his actions, including handing more power to the Salvadoran military at the expense of civilian institutions, have certainly been worrisome.    Used intelligently, Bitcoin could be a significant tool for entire nations that want to shake off the yoke of the rich, shameless northern bullies that have cost them so much.    But, again, the broader context is crucial. Bukele began his political career as a member of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a party that grew out of a leftist guerrilla movement after the 1992 end of the country’s 12-year civil war. The FMLN was supported by the Soviet Union in its fight against a right-wing Salvadoran military regime, which regularly deployed paramilitary death squads to execute and terrorize civilians.      And here, prepare to be shocked, shocked: The Salvadoran regime’s campaign of terroristic repression was supported by $1 million to $2 million in aid per day from the United States of America. Such funding was part of the U.S. Cold War policy of using developing countries as proxy battlefields against the Soviet Union. Over 75,000 Salvadorans died in the conflict between 1980 and 1992 – many of them civilians, including six Jesuit priests, murdered by U.S.-backed forces.      Across Latin America, the mindset behind such policies has lingered, even with no USSR to fight. The U.S. has used innumerable brutal, cruel and devious tactics to interfere with and depose democratically-elected left-wing politicians – especially, it seems, those most beloved by their citizens.      This is ongoing today. The U.S., and particularly the Central Intelligence Agency, are known to have actively participated in the 2019 coup against Evo Morales, the democratically elected and hugely popular leftist leader of Bolivia. Morales, Bolivia’s first indigenous chief executive, was also a stunningly effective economic planner, dramatically cutting poverty and raising the standard of living in his country. Frankly, he’s lucky to be alive.      Even more egregious is recent reporting indicating that the CIA was an active player in the so-called “Lavo Jato” operation in Brazil. While officially framed as an “anti-corruption” campaign, many observers say Lavo Jato was also effectively a coup, this time against President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, who remains extremely popular, with approval ratings over 80%, years after being deposed for supposed corruption.      Lavo Jato led directly to the empowerment of Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right ideologue who it does not seem unfair to describe as completely unhinged. Bolsonaro’s policies on everything from the Amazon rainforest to the coronavirus pandemic have done grievous harm to the Brazilian people, the Brazilian economy and the global environment.      Bukele’s resistance to anti-corruption measures should be seen in this grim context: In Latin America, “anti-corruption” is too often code for “an American plot to overthrow your government.” Bukele himself seemed to hint at this in his response to some of the corruption allegations, when he snarkily expressed shock that the investigation did not find a single case of corruption in the right-wing ARENA party that opposes him.      And these are just two horrifying recent examples – the U.S. has violently intervened in the domestic politics of Latin American countries at least 14 times since the beginning of the 20th century, according to a tally by the Associated Press. The term “banana republic” derives from America’s old habit of knocking over governments for the benefit of fruit companies - including the one now known as Chiquita Brands International. These various operations frequently involved the use of secret death squads, including the Contras in Nicaragua, whose operations were allegedly funded by the CIA’s direct involvement in international drug smuggling.      Again, you can see why a left-wing South American president might look for ways to reduce his country’s dependence on the U.S. dollar and the U.S.-controlled financial system. While death squads never go out of fashion, the increasing internationalization of banking and finance has added a subtler weapon to the imperialist arsenal. Adopting bitcoin is a first step towards loosening that death grip.      Bukele is not emphasizing this angle – and if you were in his shoes, would you? But you can bet it’s very much on his mind. Furthermore, you can bet your bottom dollar that other leaders of developing nations are thinking the same thing and, at the very least, watching to see how El Salvador’s move plays out over the coming months and years.      If it works to even a limited degree, they have every incentive to follow suit. Much attention has been focused on direct economic benefits that may accrue to El Salvador from its move toward bitcoin, such as by attracting more tech talent and investment, and those could wind up being compelling in themselves.      But the real upside might be the one that few dare say out loud: Used intelligently, bitcoin could be a significant tool for entire nations that want to shake off the yoke of the rich, shameless northern bullies that have cost them so much.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,David Z.

42406570,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAevAkx,1623422591,Bitcoin at $200K by Year's End? Some Crypto Options Traders Make That Bet,"Some bitcoin options traders are making outlandish wagers, betting on a rally to a six-figure price by year end even as the cryptocurrency continues to struggle following last month's 35% drop.      According to data provided by Laevitas, the dominant cryptocurrency options exchange Deribit saw a total of 425 bitcoin call option contracts, with a strike price of $200,000 and an expiration date of Dec. 31, change hands on Thursday. That strike price is roughly five times the current level.      A call option is a derivative contract that gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Theoretically, buying a call at the $200,000 strike expiring on Dec. 31 is a bet that the cryptocurrency will end the year above that level.      While the trade size is relatively small compared with similar gambles that CoinDesk has covered in the past, the wagers are still interesting for several reasons. To begin with, the $200,000 call options represent a long-term bet, with an expiration date a full six months away.      And because the options are so far out-of-the-money (strike well above the spot market price), they are extremely cheap, currently trading at 0.018 BTC ($698) on Deribit.      That makes the options the equivalent of a lottery ticket: Buyers stand to lose just $698 per lot if the market doesn't move higher until Dec. 31. But the option would theoretically gain significant value if the bullish mood returns to the market.      Such low-risk gambles are commonly observed during bull runs. For instance, traders piled into the $80,000 call option in March, when bitcoin was on a strong upward trajectory and trading at highs above $50,000.      Bitcoin rose to an all-time high of nearly $65,000 in April, but the price has since tumbled and now appears to be consolidating under $40,000. At press time, the largest cryptocurrency was changing hands at around $37,500.      Recently, the market has been filled with doom and gloom. However, of all the options listed on Deribit, the $100,000 call is the most popular, with an expiry-wide open interest of 9,000.      The chart also shows a small build-up of open interest in the $300,000 and $400,000 calls.      Broadly speaking, however, the options market has a bearish bias, highlighting persistent fears of a more profound decline. The one-, three- and six-month put-call skews are currently returning positive values, indicating that puts (bearish bets) are fetching higher prices (demand) than calls.

A long list of investors also participated in the fundraising round, including: Hypersphere Ventures, Gumi Cryptos, IOSG Ventures, TRG Capital Management, AU21 Capital, Digital Strategies, SNZ, Sub0 Capital, Altonomy, East Ventures and others. The round was also joined by some notable angel investors, including Nobuyuki Idei, ex-CEO and chairman of Sony.      Stake Technologies will use the funding in the parachain auctions that are scheduled to take place over the coming weeks to help win slots on both Polkadot and its more experimental cousin Kusama. (Plasm is built on Polkadot; Shiden on Kusama.)      Projects can pursue a direct sales approach, where tokens of the new network are sold in exchange for the native token of the respective parachain network, either DOT or KSM. Another strategy involves “crowd loans,” where token holders loan their DOT or KSM to be used as collateral for the parachain lease.    Read more: Kraken Now Lets Users Back Contender Projects on Polkadot’s Kusama Platform    Stake Technologies has adopted a crowd loan strategy for winning the Shiden parachain lease, giving KSM holders an incentive to contribute by offering SDN tokens as rewards. At the end of the lease period, which can range from six months to two years, the tokens are returned to their original holders. (On Kusama the lease period is capped to about 11 months.)      “Since meeting the Plasm team in 2019, when Stake Technologies was one of the very first teams building on Substrate in Longhash’s accelerator, we have been consistently impressed by the team’s ability to iterate and execute on their vision of bringing a scalable smart contract platform into the Polkadot ecosystem,” Remington Ong, a partner at Fenbushi Capital, said in a statement.      The Plasm and Shiden networks will bring a smart contract development layer to the Polkadot ecosystem that is interoperable with Ethereum and its various layer 2 scaling solutions, as well as other systems hosting apps like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs).      “The multi-blockchain approach means that Plasm and Shiden will be key contributions to the overall parachain ecosystem, with their work on scaling benefiting every other future parachain,” Jack Platts, a co-founder of Hypersphere Ventures, said in a statement.",POSITIVE,DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH | EXCHANGE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/06/11/stake-technologies-raises-10m-ahead-of-polkadot-and-kusama-auctions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd6641e72c2259f2f211cba252858e5cffdb7377-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434536,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPE33h,1623408437,Bitcoin's Steep Price Discount Seems Similar to March 2020 Bottom,"Bitcoin traded at a significant discount to its long-term moving average earlier this week, implying an overstretched bearish move and potential for reversal higher.      The cryptocurrency dropped to nearly $30,000 on Tuesday, pushing the ratio to its 20-week simple moving average (SMA) down to 0.61, the lowest since the March 2020 crash.      Historically, bitcoin has carved out major price bottoms with the ratio near 0.60.      ""Our graphic depicts bitcoin at the steepest discount to its 20-week moving average since the March 2020 bottom around $4,000,"" Mike McGlone, a senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a research note published on Wednesday. ""A more enduring discount at the end of 2018 marked the low closer to $3,000.""      If past data is a guide, Tuesday's low near $30,000 could also turn out to be a bear-market bottom. Bitcoin has bounced up slightly over the past three days to nearly $37,000, but remains well under the 200-day SMA of $42,000.      According to McGlone, the sentiment has turned a little too bearish, a feature that is often observed at market bottoms.      ""Calls for $20,000 and technical patterns such as 'death crosses' are often triggers for the more fundamentally focused and longer-term bulls to be responsive buyers,"" McGlone noted.      A death cross, or the bearish crossover of 50-day and 200-day SMAs, is widely taken to represent a long-term bearish shift in momentum. Bitcoin's 50-day SMA is trending south and looks set to cross below the 200-day line in the next few days.      Some analysts are worried that could bring in more profound losses. Those indicators, however, often trap traders on the wrong side of the markets as they are based on past data and tend to lag prices.      In other words, by the time the crossover happens, the asset is oversold and primed for a bounce. The last two instances of death crosses, March 2020 and October 2019, turned out to be bear traps.      Blockchain data shows large investors continue to accumulate coins, shrugging off the recent China crackdown on crypto mining or the death cross fears.      McGlone remains optimistic about bitcoin's long-term price prospects. ""Early days of price discovery, plus mainstream adoption and the inevitability of U.S. ETFs [exchange-traded funds], keep $100,000 resistance on our radar,"" he said.

The notice was issued to WazirX under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999 for transactions involving cryptocurrencies worth Rs 27.91 billion ($382 million), the agency said in a tweet on Friday.  Directors Nischal Shetty and Hanuam Mhatre were named alongside the company in the notice, according to The Times of India.  The publication cited an ED statement saying that the FEMA investigation was initiated on the basis of a money-laundering investigation into Chinese-owned illegal online-betting applications.  “During the course of the investigation, it was seen that the accused Chinese nationals had laundered proceeds of crime worth Rs 57 crore approximately by converting the INR deposits into cryptocurrency tether (USDT) and then transferring the same to Binance (exchange registered in Cayman Islands) wallets based on instructions received from abroad,” the statement said. (1 crore = 10 million)  WazirX received cryptocurrency worth Rs 8.8 billion ($120 million) from Binance accounts and transferred out cryptocurrency worth Rs 14 billion ($191 million) to Binance accounts during the investigation period, according to the statement.  Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange by trading volumes, acquired WazirX in late 2019.  A show cause notice requires the named parties to explain or justify something to a court.  While the Indian media is reporting the ED statement, WazirX denied receiving any show cause notice from the agency.  ""WazirX is yet to receive any show cause notice from the Enforcement Directorate as mentioned in today's media reports,"" a spokesperson told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.

BCB told CoinDesk via email the timeframe for the adoption of a Brazilian CBDC depended on the evolution of the bank's current projects and the international landscape.      ""According to the current BCB assessment, the conditions for the adoption of a Brazilian CBDC will be achieved in two to three years,"" the bank said. CBDCs are digital versions of a nation's currency issued by a central financial authority.      The comments contrast with previous statements made by the country's chief central banker, Roberto Campos Neto, who said his country could be ready for a digital currency next year.      Fresh elements of Brazil’s financial system include a newly launched instant payment system known as PIX and the expected launch of its open banking model. The bank said it depended on the success of these elements to propel it toward a CBDC launch.      Still, the bank was upbeat about the prospects a digital real could bring for the country.      ""The implantation of a Brazilian CBDC may provide new tools to foster innovation and competition in an increasingly digital economy; reduce the use of cash and therefore its maintenance cost; improve cross-border payment processes; curb illegal activities and improve financial inclusion,"" the bank said.      The digital real is expected to coexist with physical cash as well as bank deposits, the bank said.      See also: Brazil Becomes Second Country in the Americas to Approve a Bitcoin ETF      The bank also said it was ""actively"" participating in international discussions relating to global standards for national CBDCs and that the next step was to assess their impact on Brazil's economy.

Tom Emmer (R-Minn) and a bipartisan group from the House Blockchain Caucus want IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to change the federal agency’s guidance on how it considers charitable, cryptocurrency donations of more than $5,000, according to a letter sent Thursday.      The Internal Revenue Service currently requires taxpayers to have an IRS appraiser determine the value of their cryptocurrency donations. That differs from the IRS’ guidance on cryptocurrency purchases and sales, which allows taxpayers to calculate their obligations based on free market value.      The Blockchain Caucus’ chairs, Emmer, Darren Soto (D-Fla.), David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) and Bill Foster (D-Ill.), and Caucus members Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) signed the letter, which asked Rettig to amend the tax code’s Form 8283, the Noncash Charitable Contributions Form, to allow fair market evaluation for crypto donations.      “I urge the IRS to simplify this unnecessarily, and potentially unintended, complex reporting requirement for cryptocurrency, Emmer wrote, noting that cryptocurrency prices are easy to access via an “exchange or index prices.”    Read more: US Lawmaker Reintroduces Bill Seeking ‘Safe Harbor’ for Some Crypto Startups    Emmer has been after the IRS to improve its guidance.
