42421060,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBufN,1570395195,Sharia Goldbugs: How ISIS Created a Currency for World Domination,"Rachel-Rose O’Leary is a reporter at CoinDesk covering how cryptocurrencies are used in areas of economic, social and political unrest. This article is part of her series from Rojava, Syria.  As Islamic State (ISIS) sought to dominate large parts of Syria and Iraq, it used a subtle weapon to go with the car bombs and suicide attacks: money.  The self-declared caliphate aimed to unify the world under a militant interpretation of Islam. It created a highly efficient, hyper-violent society inside Iraq and Syria, coupled with an economic experiment – what I call “ISIS-coin.”  Consisting of 10 coins ranging in value from nearly a thousand dollars to pennies, ISIS sought to replace U.S., Iraqi and Syrian banknotes with purpose-built coins backed by the gold, silver and copper standard.  At the time, ISIS was sitting on 34,000 square miles of oil-rich territory. By trading oil using its own currency, the dinar, ISIS planned to destabilize the U.S. economy by forcibly decoupling the dollar from the oil business (the petro-dollar system, which ISIS refers to as America’s “Achilles heel”).  The dinar was modeled on coinage from a medieval Islamic empire named the Umayyad Caliphate, the leader of which – a man named Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan – issued coins to economically connect Muslims who were scattered across the Middle East.  In 2015, the dinar was made compulsory for civilians living under ISIS control. At its peak, ISIS controlled 10 million people across Iraq and Syria – making the ISIS dinar among the most ambitious economic experiments in modern history.  While living in the autonomous Rojava, in northern Syria, I met with an ISIS prisoner, Mohammed Najjar, in a facility operated by the Syrian Democratic Forces in Northern Syria. Najjar refused to be photographed or filmed. He was nervous about my sound recorder, and asked me not to publish his name for fear of repercussions from the jihadist group (Mohammed Najjar is a pseudonym).  Najjar worked in oil: ISIS’s most lucrative export and the heart of the dinar experiment. He laughed as I placed a silver dirham down on the table in front of him. It's a wide coin, about a centimeter in diameter. It is decorated with Arabic calligraphy – a verse from the Hadith that praises hard work and charity.  ""In Islamic State, this was a failure,"" he said, grinning, ""It didn't work.""  In a 2015 propaganda film announcing its release, called The Return of the Gold Dinar, ISIS's monetary experiment is described as a sequel to the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center – and a new weapon in an all-out war against the US economy.  ""You've seen the documentary, right?"" Najjar asks with a twinkle in his eye, adding:  ""The plan was to destroy the global economy.""  The sales pitch  Najjar joined ISIS in October 2013, months after its formation.  With a background in petroleum studies, he spent his days working among oil fields, the heart of ISIS’s economic strategy.  Controlling many oil-rich areas in Iraq and Syria, ISIS had a lucrative business in selling oil to neighboring clients, including Damascus, the Iraqi government, and Turkish-backed rebels, which, according to my source, would then smuggle the oil into Turkey.  ""It was the boom,"" Najjar said, ""Islamic State was making about $60 million a month.""  The problem for ISIS was that all that trade was executed in U.S. dollars. So in spite of the group's declared war on U.S. hegemony, its economy was actually facilitating U.S. dollar dominance.  Enter the dinar – or, as ISIS propaganda describes it: ""The return of the ultimate measure of wealth for the world: gold – as the [caliphate] surges into the financial sphere.""  First, it was introduced in the oil sector – ISIS's most lucrative export. To buy oil from ISIS, countries had to exchange their dollars for dinar.  ISIS then introduced the dinar to civilians within the Islamic State, slowly at first, with merchants giving change in the new dinar as opposed to banknotes.  By late 2015, the currency became compulsory. Said Najjar:  ""It was prohibited to use the Syrian government currency. It was prohibited to use anything other than the ISIS dinar in all the Islamic State areas.""  The Islamic State was littered with exchanges, he explained, which would swap ISIS dinar for dollars and other currencies, allowing people and businesses to trade with one another.  This came with other advantages for the Islamic State.  While the market price for a 4.25-gram gold dinar was around $160, according to Najjar, it could retail locally at $190. That meant a profit of $30 per dinar for ISIS: a colossal sum when its oil trade was peaking at 150,000 barrels a day.  Goldbugs  The ISIS dinar wasn't just a money grab.  It was also an attempt to create an economy based on Islamic principles. And that's because, in Sharia law – the religious legal code underpinning Islam – certain kinds of economic practices are forbidden.  Sharia puts a ban on interest – what is called riba – which, according to some interpretations, rules out many conventional banking practices. Certain kinds of debt are also forbidden, because transactions must be backed by an underlying asset, like gold.  The dinar experiment had its roots in the teachings of Islamic scholars such as Sayyid Abdil A’la Mawdudi, who proposed a middle-ground alternative to capitalism and communism and emphasized the importance of zakat, or charity. ISIS’s unique interpretation of zakat allowed the group to fund much of its state-building efforts through the contributions of civilians.  The New York Times reported that this tax formed the basis of the ISIS economy, stating that profit from zakat far outweighed oil sales.  But Najjar vehemently denied this point, calling it “lies” and stating that the people in ISIS-occupied territories were too poor to contribute in any meaningful way.  That’s notable because, in propaganda, ISIS describes conventional banking practices as “satanic,” and proposes the dinar as an antidote to the ""fraudulent and riba-based financial system of enslavement orchestrated by the Federal Reserve in America.""  U.S. thinkers, such as noted goldbug Mike Maloney, conspiracy theorist Edward Griffin and libertarian politician Ron Paul are quoted directly in ISIS propaganda. In rhetoric not unfamiliar to bitcoin enthusiasts, the thinkers criticize the inflation of the U.S. dollar, the abandonment of the gold standard, and the dominance of the dollar globally.  ""The U.S. is playing a game in controlling the world by using the dollars,” Najjar said, adding:  “Oil you have to buy using dollars. Internationally you have to buy everything using dollars. The dinar was more Islamic. Dinar has a real value, gold has a real value.""  Why it failed  Despite the successful launch of the dinar, ISIS remained vulnerable to economic attacks. When, in 2016, the U.S. began a bombing campaign against ISIS’s oil fields, the so-called state began to crumble because it was cut off from its most lucrative resources.  Najjar says the dinar worked better as a means of exchange in the oil industry than an everyday currency for ISIS residents and businesses.  ""We used to get it in dollars. Then they changed it to the dinar and that's when the problems started,"" he said. ""Traders stopped bringing in products because they noticed the dinar was not working, so they started retreating from it.""  With demand non-existent outside of the Islamic State, the currency began to exchange for less than it cost to produce.  ""The problem was always in buying products. The value of the silver dinar, in particular, was so low. So when you go to a trader to buy anything they won't accept this, they say, 'Ah, we're not accepting this.' Or he put the price higher,"" Najjar said.  Because of its weight – the largest coin is worth nearly a thousand dollars at the time of writing – the gold dinar was coveted by traders and was often melted down or resold on the market, effectively draining out the gold-based economy.  Not quite bitcoin  Given the restrictions of a Sharia-compliant financial system, including the prohibition on riba, cryptocurrencies have been touted as potential alternatives.  CoinDesk  recently reported that the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit that oversees the management of the ethereum platform, was courting investors from Wahhabist Saudi Arabia, for example.  But Najjar said that, while he had ""heard of bitcoin,"" he never heard of it being used by ISIS.  An SDF intelligence official confirmed that ISIS was dependent on the U.S. dollar for international trade. Other terror organizations have experimented extensively with crypto.  ISIS lost its last territory to U.S.-backed SDF forces in May. At the time, U.S. forces are said to have collected some $2.1 billion worth of gold – and intelligence officials are hoping to discover more.  “Whenever I go to an interview like this they ask me, ‘Where is the gold? Where is ISIS hiding it?’” Najjar laughed.  In North Syria, the dinar has fallen out of circulation. Some are passed around between SDF fighters as war trophies. These are mostly copper and silver – the more expensive currencies like the gold dinar have largely been melted down. Reselling the currency is illegal and those in circulation are seized by authorities, aside from a handful kept as souvenirs.  According to Najjar, the failure of the dinar – and Islamic State more broadly – was because it failed to implement Sharia correctly.  “Islam says take from the rich and give it to the poor,” he said, adding:  “It was not properly done. It was not implemented properly, it wouldn't fall. I see it like this.""

42403308,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfiWu,1570354802,What It's Like Being CIO of a Crypto Fund,"Jeff Dorman, a partner at crypto asset management firm Arca Funds, spent 18 years on Wall Street and in fintech before turning his focus to developing crypto asset strategies and products.  This article originally appeared in ‘Institutional Crypto,’ a weekly CoinDesk newsletter focused on the institutional investors interested in crypto assets. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s.      After 365 days of running a crypto fund, one thing is certain: it’s exhausting. And yet, at the same time, I’m more energized than ever.  Arca just completed its first full year managing LP capital in its flagship Digital Assets Fund. As chief investment officer, I experienced first-hand the trials and tribulations of building, launching and managing capital in the newest, most misunderstood and potentially most lucrative asset class available to institutional investors today.  Let’s take stock of the last year, reflect and see where we go from here.  Building a team and a strategy  Starting a crypto fund is a lot like trying to build Uber while the car is being invented.  We’re working with an incomplete deck and everything is brand new, from the service providers and the systems/tools, to even the valuation techniques. This past year was just as much about business development as it was investment process. Running a crypto fund is an all-encompassing 24/7 job, and there are no shortcuts when trying to build long-lasting client trust.  In the traditional world, you wouldn’t even try to start a fund with less than $150 million in assets. At a 1.5 percent management fee, that’s $2.25 million/year to spend on salaries and infrastructure needed to employ top talent and ensure operationally sound practices. So how do you build the same caliber team when the median assets under management (AUM) for crypto funds is under $5 million?  For starters, there is no waste. Everyone wears multiple hats. The qualities we look for include flexibility as much as niche specialization. Perhaps, more importantly, passion is a must, as employee motivation has to come from more than just expected compensation.  The investing strategy is just as important as the team, because employees and investors understand that our investment process and capabilities will remain consistent and be scalable. Even in a constantly changing industry, the processes and procedures in place have to be enforced consistently to ensure repeatability as the sector and our fund grow. To do this correctly, we need help from the service providers.  Operational hurdles  Perhaps the most startling and time-consuming aspect is managing the sheer volume of service providers, which dwarfs the number of funds in crypto.  In traditional asset management, incumbents reign supreme, and you’d only evaluate new service providers 3x per year. In crypto, we’re evaluating new service providers 3x per week. As there is no regulation, no incumbents that dominate and an unlimited amount of VC funding, the barriers to entry as a service provider are near zero. On one hand, this is refreshing because we get to start from scratch without relying on inefficient legacy tools; but, on the other hand, many of the service providers don’t have much experience servicing asset management clients.  In 2011, after 10 years working on the sell-side at traditional investment banks, I moved to the buy-side for the first time. It was immediately clear how little I understood about how my old clients performed their jobs until I was in their shoes. I used to joke that everyone on the sell-side should be forced to have a three-month internship on the buy-side, and vice versa, to understand how the other side operates.  This advice applies equally to crypto. Many of the service providers are building tools they think funds and investors should need, instead of working with their clients to try to understand what our needs are. For example, there are at least 50 new exchanges that want me to trade bitcoin with them, but very few have been able to articulate in three sentences why I should.  That said, it’s impossible to dismiss any firm until doing proper due diligence, because getting these solutions right is essential towards building long-lasting institutional investor trust. And we have slowly moved forward with some of the best new startups in crypto. My job as CIO is to help these firms build the best solution, but also to wait until they solve a need for my fund and my investors before moving forward.  Managing 24/7 risk  Once we’ve established the team and systems, we have to actually make money on our investments.  As everyone in this industry knows, the crypto markets never sleep. Even while writing this, I’ve taken six breaks to check our risk and the price movements of our investments. However, contrary to popular belief, this space doesn’t require ""round the clock"" trading. It requires disciplined risk management procedures, constant communication between team members with trading authority, and the willingness to step away from the screens to allow you to think clearly enough to see the forest for the trees.  While 24/7 trading is a feature and not a bug of crypto investing, there are some benefits to the legacy financial system’s trading hours. Even the worst weeks come to an end, allowing the market to collectively reset. In crypto, there is no reset (unless forced upon participants manually), so momentum has no natural off switch.  Managing volatility is hard enough during work hours. Doing it from home while cooking dinner for two starving toddlers is nearly impossible. As such, process and planning trumps even the best traders and algorithms. While we always have someone available to trade if needed, it has benefited us tremendously not forcing investments just because the market is open.  Fundraising  Of course, having a strong team and a scalable strategy doesn’t mean investors will throw money at you.  As new as this industry is for all of the asset managers, it’s even more foreign for investors looking to allocate to this space. Traditional hedge funds often pretend it’s still 1982, when it was important to be secretive so the other nine hedge funds didn’t steal their best ideas. Yet in today’s world of constant communication and interconnectivity, not to mention high competition amongst funds, transparency is the key to earning investor trust.  We spend an enormous amount of time educating our investors and our prospects. This is necessary for this asset class, especially when your investor base is sophisticated and has a different level of risk tolerance than the current set of crypto investors.  While potentially a longer process than more established areas of finance, you have a chance to forge lasting relationships built on education and not a transactional commoditized sale.  Comparing crypto to traditional funds  While many crypto investors come from tech backgrounds and are now trying to learn how to manage outside capital for the first time, we take the opposite approach.  We believe understanding how to manage risk is the critical skill, and everything else can be learned. Would you look to your mechanic to manage your automobile stocks? Does your doctor manage your healthcare stocks? In the same vein, your developer shouldn’t manage your crypto assets. In my 20-year finance career, it took me two months to learn how to analyze companies, two years to learn how to trade, and two decades (and counting) to learn how to manage risk. There is no short-cut.  Our backgrounds in traditional finance come in handy every day, from modeling to risk management to marketing. While I wish I had learned to program at age 12 because it would have made my adult life easier; at the same time, I don’t believe it would make me a better crypto fund manager. There is a reason “two guys and a Bloomberg” hasn’t been a very successful hedge fund strategy in the traditional world, as it has become impossible for one or two people to do everything well. The roles of CIO, PM, Research Analyst, Trader and back-office are very different and require specialized skill sets to do the job properly.  Having a balanced approach and different viewpoints across the portfolio team allows us to think more objectively about the real risks and opportunities in this asset class.  The reality is, crypto is both a technology and a financial product, and having collective knowledge in both creates a winning formula. Once those roles and differentiations are established, managing a crypto fund is no different than managing an equity, fixed income or managed futures fund. Portfolio managers manage risk, analysts analyze, traders trade, and the CIO pulls it all together.  Concluding thoughts  I started this by saying I’m both exhausted and energized. While these may seem mutually exclusive, in crypto it makes sense. The speed, growth and promise of this industry light a fire under me and my team every minute of every day.  There is so much to learn, read and talk about, but that also means there is little time to do anything else. The risk of burning out is real.  Recently, we instituted mandatory days off and often turn the screens off in the middle of the day for short periods of time just so we can think without price factoring into the thought process. We’ve begun to realize that any small short-term moves in price that we don’t capture in real-time are often offset by our ability to think clearly enough to capture the larger, more sustainable ones.  I’ve spent my entire career investing or building businesses. Now I get to do both at the same time. The most rewarding part of being CIO is knowing that we’re at the dawn of the next big global technological advancement. We have a global platform where we can recruit new people to this industry, and shepherd others into this asset class as investors. We write and speak constantly, which is as much a part of our internal investment process as it is our external education process.  As this space evolves further, my job will inevitably morph as well. And that excites me, enough to fight through the exhaustion.
