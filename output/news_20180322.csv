42401334,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcY4Tk,1521761407,Report: JPMorgan Considers Spinoff of Quorum Blockchain Division,"Global banking giant JPMorgan Chase is reportedly thinking about spinning out its Quorum blockchain project as an independent company.  Citing anonymous sources, the Financial Times and Reuters reported late Thursday that the move, if it happens, would be part of an effort to ""increase the platform's appeal.""  Talks regarding the spinoff are ""still in the early days,"" according to Reuters.  Quorum, an open-source project, was launched in 2016 as a permissioned version of ethereum. JPMorgan debuted the project at the annual Sibos conference.  According to Reuters, a JPMorgan spokesperson declined to ""comment on speculation"" regarding the supposed move, but said that ""Quorum has become an extremely successful enterprise platform even beyond financial services and we’re excited about its potential.""  Reuters could not confirm whether Quorum's existing employees would join the spun-off entity. The project has notably been headed up by JPMorgan's Blockchain Center of Excellence executive director Amber Baldet.  It is similarly unclear what Baldet's plans are should Quorum be launched as an independent entity, an anonymous source told Reuters.  The bank's spokesperson told Reuters, ""we continue to believe distributed ledger technology will play a transformative role in business which is why we are actively building multiple blockchain solutions.""  Last year  , the Quorum team announced an interbank payments system in partnership with Australian bank ANZ and the Royal Bank of Canada.

The Bitfury-backed company announced Monday that it had secured a deal with the city of Medicine Hat to both lease land and receive 42 megawatts of electrical power for a new mining facility. In turn, Hut 8 will inject $100 million into the local community by way of a construction project.  The new building is fully funded, the company announced in a press release,https://www.hut8mining.com/hut-8-mining-corp-announces-electricity-supply-agreement-city-medicine-hat/ and the facility will join Hut 8's existing, smaller building in Drumheller, which uses 18.7 megawatts to power its array of machines.  The contract between Hut 8 and the City will last 10 years, and will begin after several regulatory agencies sign off on the company's work.  Bill Tai, chair of Hut 8's Board of Directors, said the agreement is a key step in the company's plans to start using its BlockBox Data Centers.  ""CMH offers stable cost-competitive utility rates and has been very welcoming and supportive of Hut 8's fast paced growth plans,"" he said in a statement. ""We're excited to work with the City of Medicine Hat to introduce a new industry, with new revenue channels for the City and its residents.""  To build out its facilities, Hut 8 will hire some 100 workers, with 42 employees set to be hired full-time in order to run the mine. Hut 8 will recruit from the local community, according to the press release.

Saga Launches With Big-Shot Advisor Team,"The Swiss non-profit Saga Foundation announced on Thursday that it is developing a new non-anonymous stablecoin with the help of some bigwig advisors.  Namely, the advisory council includes JPMorgan Chase International chairman Jacob Frenkel; Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences Myron Scholes; financial futures pioneer and CME Chairman Emeritus Leo Melamed; and the co-director of the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts, Cornell University Prof. Emin Gun Sirer.  Dubbed Saga or SGA, the coin will be backed by a ""variable fractional reserve"" pegged to the International Monetary Fund's special drawing rights (SDR) – an international reserve asset created in 1969 to supplement member countries' official reserves for the purpose of expanding global trade.  Specifically, the platform will use smart contracts to regulate the market, according to the white paper. These contracts will generate SGA tokens as needed to meet demand, and will also ""burn,"" or destroy tokens when the price slips.  Notably, users would sell tokens back to the network, not to each other.  Some tokens will be kept in reserve for times when liquidity is hard to come by, but most are expected to be converted to fiat currencies, according to the white paper.  ""Therefore,"" the company explained in the statement, ""the reserve acts as a buffer, limiting the impact of market fluctuations.""  It claims that the system ""can set the ground for the currency to become a store of value and a medium of exchange.""  ""Saga represents a step change in maturity for digital currencies,"" Mark Tluszc, CEO at Sage investor Mangrove Capital Partners, said in a statement. ""The first that combines material benefits to the existing financial system with the potential and needs of the digital world.""  The foundation will do away with the anonymity some cryptocurrencies offer by subjecting Saga holders to know your customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) requirements under Swiss law.  The company has eschewed carrying out an ICO in favor of raising funds from venture capital and hedge fund investors.

In a press statement, the spokesperson said that the bitcoins had been distributed to the winning bidders, one of whom received 2,100 and the other who bought the remaining 70.7.  It is unclear whether the bitcoins were bought at market prices, but at press time the combined total value of the bitcoins was roughly $18.7 million.  Forty-two bidders registered for the auction, and 39 bids were received, the spokesperson said.  The auction was announced on March 5, when the Marshals stated the coins would be sold in 14 different blocks (as in ""lots,"" not the cryptocurrency meaning of the word).  The smallest auction block contained roughly 70 bitcoins, while the other 13 blocks contained either 100 or 500 bitcoins.

San Francisco-based Blockchain Capital’s portfolio already includes fintech companies such as Coinbase, Ripple, Circle, and Kraken. It has long been one of the blockchain industry’s leading firms, investing in 72 companies, tokens and protocols since it was founded in 2013.  This recent round is Blockchain Capital’s largest to date. It came in two parts: $125 million for the Blockchain Capital IV LP fund and $25 million worth of cryptocurrency for Blockchain Capital Parallel Fund IV. It did not disclose what kind of tokens the latter fund accepted, just that it only takes crypto.  Co-founder and managing partner Bart Stephens told CoinDesk the firm is especially interested in non-fungible tokens, like the virtual pet game CryptoKitties, as well as diverse blockchain solutions. He said:  ""You're going to see us continue to invest globally in the leading crypto companies, but also kind of the next generation of entrepreneurs and sectors outside of financial services.

Search Giant Eyes Blockchain for Audits,"Google may be looking to secure audit information using blockchain tech, a patent application published on Thursday suggests.  The filing, released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and submitted in September 2017, proposes using a blockchain to create a ""tamper-evident"" log which can store signatures, verify that information stored by the system has not been altered, or provide a clear path to find what information was changed and when.  The application describes using two blockchains, one referred to as the ""target blockchain,"" which contains ""first signatures."" A second, separate blockchain would store the data verified by the signature.  The company goes on to explain:  ""The method may include, by the electronic device, adding a new block to the target blockchain, by linking the new block to both the existing block and the block of the second blockchain that is identified by generating a signature for the new block that is based on the first signature and the second signature, and associating the signature with the new block. The target blockchain and the second blockchain may be part of a block lattice.""  The application noted that the blockchain could be based on multiple data storage spaces, or the entire chain could be stored on one device.  The timing of the release is notable – though likely incidental – given that Bloomberg reported Wednesday that the search engine giant is developing what the news service characterized as ""a blockchain-related"" platform to support its cloud business.  Citing anonymous parties, Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant was working on a distributed ledger that can store transaction histories. However, it is unclear when such a project would be launched commercially.  A Google spokesperson told Bloomberg that it is ""way too early for us to speculate about any possible uses or plans.""

Dubbed Maritime Blockchain Labs (MBL) and announced Thursday, the project is being founded in partnership with Denmark-based Blockchain Labs for Open Collaboration (BLOC). The labs will look at the use of engineered systems and blockchain-powered supply chains to address the safety and security of both critical infrastructure and people in the global maritime industry.  Deanna MacDonald, CEO of BLOC, said in a press release:  “Our objectives are twofold: to get real-world applications on the ground as soon as possible, and to share knowledge and methodologies among users. Blockchain is fundamentally a collaborative technology and will only truly transform the industry if we are all working from the same, or interlinked, systems, rather than competing.”  Since maritime safety is an international challenge, MBL aims to facilitate cooperation between diverse industry players, including competitors. Information sharing, the announcement says, could help boost returns in the sector, while at the same time reducing risks.  “By fostering a collaborative approach we can de-risk the space,” MacDonald said. “Demonstrate capacity and build the technical as well as educational foundations necessary for collectively developing and applying this emerging technology.”  Over the next 18 months, Maritime Blockchain Labs will work on developing three demo projects that will focus on aspects of risk and safety that can be addressed with distributed solutions, the release states.  “The three demonstrators will build, apply and model the use of distributed systems to create impacts that enhance safety of life and property at sea and serve as case examples to be shared with the community,"" said MacDonald.

Having clocked a two-week high of $7.34 earlier today, the token is now changing hands at $6.68 – up 7.7 percent for the last 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap. Notably, EOS is also up 70 percent from the low of $3.95 seen on Sunday. The token now ranks seventh on the list of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.  It is worth noting that EOS is the only cryptocurrency reporting gains over the last day. Bitcoin (BTC), is down 4 percent on a 24-hour basis. Coins like ether, XRP and cardano are down 6–9 percent.  The positive price actions may be driven by joint venture news and rumors of exchange listings, according to online discussions.  Block.one, the developer behind the leading blockchain software EOS.io, yesterday announced a $100 million joint venture with German fintech incubator FinLab AG to develop projects that use the EOS blockchain. Further, talk is flying around that EOS will be listed on Upbit – one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea.  And, last but not least, trading volume has risen by a staggering 189 percent since March 18, signaling the cryptocurrency will likely continue gaining altitude in the near future.  The technical charts, too, are largely positive, and indicate that EOS may be looking at a bullish trend reversal soon.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  EOS is struggling to beat the falling channel hurdle.  The 5-day moving average (MA) and the 10-day MA are trending north, indicating short-term bullish setup.  The 50-day MA and 100-day MA bearish crossover favors the bears.  View  A minor pullback to $5.50 is likely, given the intraday overbought conditions.  A convincing upside break of the falling channel would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change and negate the bearish 50-day MA and 100-day MA crossover. In this scenario, EOS will likely test the immediate resistance located at $12.50 (Dec. 19 high).  Only a daily close (as per UTC) below $5.16 (March 9 low) would abort the bullish vie and open doors for a re-test of $$3.87 (March 18 low).

42401330,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcY4Po,1521723562,Better Bitcoin Relay? Crypto VCs Back BloXroute Funding,"There's one part of bitcoin that isn't censorship resistant – its relay network.  At least that's according to the team at BloXroute Labs, which just brought its network for relaying information between blockchain nodes out of stealth with an impressive group of investors including AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant, Metastable, 1confirmation and Flybridge Capital. Through these investors, the company raised $1.6 million in an equity round.  But the new network is more ambitious than the capital suggests. Called BloXroute, the project aims to make relay networks censorship-resistant against any number of powers by blinding the system from knowing how nodes connect with each other. And that, they say, is an improvement on the current infrastructure, largely built over the years by volunteers.  To understand this, it helps to know where relay networks originated, coming about as ""mining pools,"" or networks of miners seeking to share profit started to form.  Smaller mining pools saw a higher number of orphan blocks (those that weren't eventually added to the blockchain) since they were usually not the ones that found blocks. This meant they spent time working on the wrong blocks as the information took time to propagate to them. So, in an effort to level the playing field, relay networks allowed faster for the faster propagation of information over the network.  While Uri Klarman, BloXroute Lab's CEO, said existing relay networks, including bitcoin developer Matt Corallo's FIBRE and Cornell Universities' Falcon, are working fine in this regard, these networks allow parties to understand network traffic, such as the IP address of the node, where it's sending information and where that information is coming from.  In this way, existing relay networks offer insight into transactions that governments, big businesses and others could exploit, censoring certain wallets.  ""If the protocol depends on the relay network to scale, then that ends up that everyone has to trust the relay network for that work,"" Klarman said, adding:  ""Then what's the point of the blockchain? Just leave the bank in the middle.""  The BDN  In an effort to eliminate this issue, Klarman collaborated with Cornell's Emin Gun Sirer and Soumya Basu to build what they call a ""Blockchain Distributed Network"" or BDN.  Inspired by the content delivery networks that allow data on the Web to be delivered quickly all around the world, the BDN is entirely controlled by BloXroute Labs. But, the company has spent a significant amount of time building in blinds that will keep the network from being censored.  The government wouldn't try to shut down the company, and in turn the whole network, just for a couple bad actors.  And some of the top venture capitalists in the space believe in that vision, seeing how this is the first time investors have funneled money into a relay network-like technology.  Ravikant told CoinDesk that's what he sees as the value-add.  ""I liked it because it's addressing one of the top two problems with blockchains – scalability and the other is decentralization,"" he said.  A networking problem  Going deeper, BloXroute Lab's neutrality is based on its ignorance of what it carries. Put another way, the protocol ""doesn't know what is the data it's propagating,"" Klarman said.  In fact, it doesn't even know what network it's serving. BloXroute is meant not to privilege any blockchain. Instead, it wants to make it easy for every blockchain to scale.  To that end, BloXroute's white paper describes methods that enable users to audit its blindness.  While Klarman is most proud of the censorship-resistance the team has built into the system, like Ravikant said, scalability is another one of BloXroute Labs' benefits.  ""Our network is a lot faster than anything out there, by orders of magnitude,"" Klarman contended, pointing to the fact that the company has brought together a group of experts and has some centralized control, which allows for extra speed.  And that speed is really the key to scaling blockchains, he continued.  As blocks get larger, they take longer to propagate around the network. And Klarman fears a day when blocks become so large that the data can't reach all miners quickly enough (before the next block gets verified) and end up causing forks.  If the last block hasn't reached every miner on the network before the next block gets verified, the whole blockchain will start to unravel, the project's white paper explains.  Klarman told CoinDesk:  ""Most people get the scalability problem wrong. Our main argument is the following: the scalability problem is really a networking problem.""  The token  But while BloXroute Labs isn't at the stage of focusing on revenue, its white paper does mention a token meant to provide a way to invest in BloXroute Labs (not access the system). (BloXroute has not stated when these tokens will go on sale.)  At first, BloXroute will be completely free to use. Nodes will pay BloXroute by adding a very small extra charge to transaction processing fees to users, but Klarman contends this should more than be paid for by the fact that the scaling it permits will prevent the bottlenecks that cause fees to go up.  The fees will be negligible, fractions of a penny, but 50 percent of all fees collected would go into a fund backed by the bloXroute token. The token entitles a holder to a proportional share in all the fees that had collected in that fund up until redemption. So, if there were 100 tokens and $100 in the fund, redeeming a token would be worth $1.  As BloXroute becomes hugely popular and orders of magnitude more transactions are going through, it will also reserve a percentage of its bandwidth for transactions that don't pay the fee. Klarman said, the ""limitation is in place to prevent bloXroute from censoring transactions,"" even freeriding transactions.  That scale of activity is a long way off, though. BloXroute and its supporters are more focused now on proving the promised speed, and that's why its earned the support of major crypto investors.  ""We're excited about all of the research that is currently happening around figuring out blockchain scalability and we think that it's possible that there are many winners here."" Nick Tomaino of 1Confirmation told CoinDesk.  As anyone who followed the scaling debate within bitcoin knows, though, scaling is both a technical problem and a governance problem.  Take bitcoin for example: even if bloXroute's speed really clears away any concerns about increasing block sizes, the miners still have to opt-in. Nothing can force them to. When asked why he was sure bitcoin miners would adjust block size even as propagation becomes easier, Klarman argued that bitcoin alone isn't really the point.  ""We remove the scalability for all cryptos. And this is the point where cryptos should start to compete over real-world traction,"" Klarman said.  He concluded:  ""Each crypto would make its own decision what to do.""

According to a report from Nikkei on Thursday that is being widely cited, the country's Financial Services Agency (FSA) may be about to order the Hong Kong-based firm to cease offering services in the country since it is not registered with the regulator.  The report said the FSA is concerned that the company's operations may pose a risk to the country's investors and may lodge criminal charges with the police authorities if Binance does not comply with the registration mandate.  While currently the FSA has not yet published any formal statement, the report said the effort is aimed at providing a healthy cryptocurrency trading environment by tackling unregistered exchanges.  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has since hit out at the reports, however, saying the firm is in dialogue with the regulator.  He stated on Twitter:  ""Nikkei showed irresponsible journalism. We are in constructive dialogs with Japan FSA, and have not received any mandates. It does not make sense for JFSA to tell a newspaper before telling us, while we have an active dialog going on with them.""

Speaking to the audience via webcam at a Blockstack event in Berlin early March, Snowden for the first time gave the audience his detailed views on the emerging technology. While agreeing that bitcoin will endure for a long period of time, Snowden argued that he does not believe “bitcoin will last forever.”  “Everybody is focused on the transaction rate limitations of bitcoin being its central flaw, and that is a major one,” he said, adding that, actually, “the much larger structural flaw, the long-lasting flaw, is its public ledger.”  The whistleblower further explained that the existing mechanism of the bitcoin blockchain has the problem of balancing recording every transaction history with attempting to scale its capacity in processing these transactions.  “That is simply incompatible with having an enduring mechanism for trade, because you cannot have a lifelong history of everyone's purchases, all of the interactions be available to everyone and have that work out well at scale,” he told the audience.  Talking of his own personal preference in terms of cryptocurrencies, Snowden said:  ""When we talk about which cryptocurrencies are interesting to me, I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, zcash for me is the most interesting right now, because the privacy properties of it are truly unique, but we see more and more projects that are trying to emulate this and I think this is a positive thing.""  Snowden also aired the concern that having a public ledger that documents every transaction history, while it may appeal to a global consumer base, could also draw interest from governments that wish to outlaw the technology.  The comments coincide with reports yesterday of leaked documents suggesting that the NSA may be using its powerful surveillance technology to track, not just the blockchain ledger, but also individual bitcoin users of the distributed network.  Elsewhere, Snowden also raised the issue of cryptocurrency technology being used by dictators in launching state-run projects, such as the Petro token recently issued by the Venezuelan government.  Answering a question over whether he is worried about emerging technologies like blockchain ""being co-opted by dictators, by powerful entities, corrupt entities,"" Snowden said:  “It's not a question of if they will be, it's a question of when they will be. It's a question of how do we design competing systems that are simply so attractive that they will not be ignored by the global consumer base, but also the governments themselves who are seeking to compete against them will not simply be able to outlaw them and have that be meaningful.”  Edward Snowden image via Blockstack/YouTube",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET | ZEC,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/03/22/edward-snowden-public-ledger-is-bitcoins-big-flaw,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/05616c6b8d61e13326c753b62768ccb9da5c87d0-1051x772.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a report from Yonhap, the Financial Intelligence Unit and Financial Services Commission (FSC) will launch the inspection starting next month at banks offering corporate accounts to cryptocurrency exchanges.  The investigation, according to the report, follows a previous mandate from financial watchdogs in South Korea that domestic cryptocurrency exchanges may only resume operation with a real-name verification system integrated with domestic banks.  As reported by CoinDesk, the FSC announced in January that, from the end of the month, banks would no longer be allowed to service virtual accounts for investors at cryptocurrency exchanges, an effort that sought to prevent anonymous cryptocurrency transactions from being used in money-laundering activities.  Based on the new rules, financial institutions in South Korea have rolled out self-implementation of real-name verification with more major exchanges, while reportedly closing doors to smaller firms.  The new probe comes as the South Korea government is widening its efforts to ensure anti-money laundering mandates are well executed across the country's financial system.

42401342,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcY4bc,1521714920,Pullback Ahead? Bitcoin Hits Stiff Resistance at $9K,"The bulls' repeated failure to take out resistance around $9,000 has boosted the odds of a pullback in bitcoin prices, according to the technical charts.  The cryptocurrency scaled the $9,000 mark on Tuesday, signaling a short-term bullish reversal. However, BTC has spent a better part of the 48 hours since trading the narrow range of $8,700–$9,200, as per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  The move above $9,000 coincided with Tether's latest token issue. The company printed 300 million new USDT via OMNI, pushing the yearly total close to $850 million. Comments on social media indicated that investors were expecting a solid rally in bitcoin (BTC) prices after the issuance of the USD-pegged crypto, but it wasn't to be.  The exhaustion above $9,000 is not surprising: BTC has rallied close to $2,000 from the March 18 low of $7,335 without a notable pullback. Further, multiple key resistance levels are lined up in the $9,180–$9,470 range, as discussed yesterday. Also, the upside is being capped by the descending 100-MA (moving average), the 4-hour chart shows.  As of writing, the BPI is seen at $8,718. The global average price, as calculated by CoinMarketCap, stands at $8,773 – down 3.38 percent in the last 24 hours.  The price chart analysis indicates scope for a pullback if the bulls fail to defend support at $8,750.  Hourly chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  A rising wedge reversal, a bearish continuation pattern, meaning the downside break seen yesterday marks the resumption of the sell-off from the March 12 high of $9,900.  A double top-like pattern with the neckline support at $8,752.  Acceptance below $8,752 would only add credence to the rising wedge reversal and open the doors for a drop to 200-hour moving average (MA) located at $8,377.  Daily chart  Bitcoin created a doji candle yesterday at the 200-day MA resistance, signaling indecision among the bulls. A close (as per UTC) below $8,752 (previous day's low) today would indicate the corrective rally from the low of $7,240 has ended.

According to Japanese news source Nikkei, the country's National Police Agency (NPA) released its first annual report of statistics tracking thefts from cryptocurrency accounts on Thursday.  The data shows that at least 149 cases of hacking emerged last year, with 16 cryptocurrency exchanges affected, as well as three wallet operators, through which around 662 million Japanese yen was illegally remitted. Bitcoin was as the biggest crypto target, with 85 BTC stolen, the report says.  While the agency did not disclose the name of the services affected, it noted that the recent $530 million hack of the Coincheck exchange is not included in its 2017 statistics.  Out of all the thefts, 122 cases – accounting for over 80 percent of the total – did not incorporate extra levels of security such as two-factor authentication, the report indicates.  Furthermore, a growth in the number cases was seen to coincide with the increasing price of bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market. For example, data shows that unauthorized remittances increased from 7 cases in April to 19 and 41 in May and June, respectively.  The data release comes as an effort by the agency to investigate thefts of assets from cryptocurrency investors in Japan following the notorious collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange in 2014 and the government's extensive actions in force exchanges to protect cryptocurrency investors since.

The company announced the initiative on Wednesday, noting that its primary objective will be to facilitate research on blockchain technology and to develop projects in collaboration with private and public sector organizations.  ""The center underscores Fujitsu's commitment to blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies as a means to revolutionize the way consumers and enterprises buy, sell and exchange goods and services and for organizations to transform their commercial and operational models,"" the firm said.  Yves de Beauregard, head of Fujitsu Benelux, cited increased customer interest in blockchain technology as the impetus for the creation of the center, and noted that Belgium's geographical location, among other factors, made it a desirable place in which to launch the initiative.  The company also revealed that the center would focus on projects relating to smart cities.  Frederik De Breuck, pre-sales and business assurance director at Fujitsu Benelux, explained that the proportion of the world population inhabiting urban areas is set to increase rapidly over the next thirty years, and that as such, it would be necessary to develop services that ""combine ICT with infrastructure and architecture to address social, economic and environmental problems.""  ""The use of blockchain technology with its potential in public ledger and voting ID, and its capacity to automate processes and auditing in smart contracts, will doubtlessly play an important role in this changing ecosystem,"" De Breuck said.  As CoinDesk has previously reported, Fujitsu is far from a newcomer to the blockchain industry.  In 2016, it announced that it had developed a blockchain-based system for securely sharing documents and subsequently released a different system for secure data sharing in 2017.  It is also a member of the Hyperledger consortium and has released several projects to be used with the group's blockchain platfrom, Hyperledger Fabric .

42401333,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcY4Rm,1521705640,Zcash's Coming Hard Fork Could Pave the Way for More,"Privacy-focused cryptocurrency zcash is gearing up for its first hard fork.  And while that may call to mind bitter debates over development or excitement about free coins, actually zcash's first hard fork – dubbed ""Overwinter"" – isn't about either. Instead, the cryptocurrency's developer team is hoping to lay the groundwork for more dramatic upgrades in the future.  While there are some features being added to zcash in the update, Zooko Wilcox, co-founder and CEO of Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, which develops the network, told CoinDesk, ""The purpose of this is to get practice doing network upgrades.""  As such, the developer team has been carefully informing the zcash community about the process so ""they know how to do this regularly from now on,"" he continued.  Most of Zcash's developer energy is focused on perfecting Overwinter, which is slated for June, while also looking ahead to zcash's next hard fork upgrade, called Sapling. This subsequent hard fork will usher in a big change, speeding up transactions on the network while maintaining the same level of privacy the cryptocurrency already provides.  Speaking to the names of the upgrades (zcash's software stage is currently called ""Sprout""), Wilcox said he foresees a smooth transition.  He told CoinDesk:  ""If you have a sprout, after it has endured cold, it becomes tougher.""  And should zcash survive this winter, surely, according to its devs, the cryptocurrency will be stronger.  While the thinking on forks has shifted some, hard forks have been seen as controversial since they are a kind of governance mechanism that forces users to move along with a technical change. Should the zcash community ride out this first transition, though, zcash developers believe it can handle others.  ""If I say 'hard fork,' immediately people ask me what the name of the new coin is and if there will be an airdrop,"" Wilcox said, adding that he prefers to call Overwinter a ""network upgrade.""  But according to Wilcox, that won't be the case with this hard fork, since ""people would rather have version 2.0"" of zcash with new features that unlock immediately.  Through the winter  First and foremost, Overwinter adds so-called replay protection to zcash, whereby should some users stay on the old chain and send transactions, those transactions will not be repeated on the new chain.  According to Wilcox, this is more of a precaution instead of a feature, since he doesn't expect any users to not upgrade to the new system (albeit, this could be a problem with future hard forks that introduce more controversial upgrades).  The feature that Wilcox is most excited about, then, is the addition of ""transaction expiry,"" a mechanism which prompts transactions to expire after an hour.  While this might sound odd, it quite frequently happens that transactions get stuck, held in limbo because users don't pay high enough fees to make miners pick up the transaction and add it to a block.  ""Some people think it's a bad idea,"" Wilcox said.  Those in opposition believe it could lead to security issues, but to Wilcox, this feature will prevent users from losing money if they accidentally send a transaction on the wrong chain.  As such, this feature allows zcash, which was derived from bitcoin's code, to further differentiate itself from the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  The other big change that Overwinter will bring to the zcash network will address ""signature verification performance,"" and this too will further move zcash into a new role, not defined by bitcoin.  According to Wilcox, ""We have a bug we inherited from the bitcoin codebase where if you verify signatures with a whole lot of [unspent transaction outputs or UTXOs], it takes too long. This fixes that.""  The holy grail?  Beyond these known upcoming hard forks, zcash has other plans for tackling one of cryptocurrencies most notorious challenges – scaling.  Sure enough, zcash has already proven to be the cryptocurrency of wild ideas, with its second cryptographic ceremony for keeping the system private taking place recently. (Participants in such events are known to take bizarre measures, including using strangers answers to questions to acquire randomness and putting a flamethrower to a computer.)  While the zcash developer team hasn't been very public about their more experimental research so far, Wilcox gave CoinDesk some insight into their work.  For instance, the team is following all the big ideas in the crypto space today, including ethereum's plasma and sharding work and bitcoin's open-source Lightning Network development.  That said, Wilcox isn't sure who will find the scaling holy grail first.  ""Maybe it'll be us,"" he said, going on to argue zcash might be able to gain scalability by focusing on its own specialty – zk-snarks.  Known as the technology anonymizing zcash transactions, zk-snarks are also a promising avenue for compressing blockchain data.  But he isn't trumpeting the solution just yet, arguing that even if it does work, it will take ""years"" for the benefits to trickle down to users.  Still, Wilcox concluded that zcash is in the race:  ""We're researching to see if using zk-proofs can make a fully scalable blockchain.""

While some at last week's D.C. Blockchain Summit say they suspect the government isn't sincere, David Treat, a managing director and co-head of Accenture's Global Blockchain Practice, believes this answer couldn't be farther from reality.  Despite the sometimes heated rhetoric of the nation's lawmakers on some of its more controversial applications, Treat believes government interest in the technology has produced ""an unprecedented degree of participation and collaboration,"" one that is an equal opportunity for Accenture.  Perhaps predictably, Accenture wishes to capitalize on this by using its prior experience in developing government services to secure a central role in the U.S. government's blockchain pursuits, particularly those related to digital identity.  The professional services company is currently working with partners such as the World Economic Forum and the United Nations on projects like the Known Traveler Identity Initiative and the ID2020 Alliance. They're also speaking to people at whom the technology is directed - refugees, for instance.  But, according to Treat, digital identity projects must necessarily involve individuals and governments.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Ultimately, it's important that how we modernize digital identity satisfies all of the needs of what a nation-state needs as well as an individual, and we think the solution pattern we're designing and starting to build really threads that needle and can satisfy both.""  While digital identity issues are a priority for Accenture, it also has its sights set on facilitating the government adoption of other blockchain applications.  According to Treat, Accenture welcomes the input of regulators in the development of its blockchain services. ""The more they can come along with everyone else and be part of that innovation journey and modernize regulation, the better off we're going to be,"" he claimed.  Despite this congenial attitude, Treat said in the interview that he wouldn't go as far as calling himself ""pro-regulation."" Rather,""pro-engagement with the regulatory community,"" he clarified.

According to a statement from the office of the Treasury, Hammond will reveal the task force, which will include the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority in addition to the Treasury, at the government's second International Fintech Conference.  The initiative, part of the government's larger Fintech Sector Strategy, ""will help the U.K. to manage the risks around Cryptoassets, as well as harnessing the potential benefits of the underlying technology,"" he said in the statement.  Hammond is also set to announce several other measures relating to the fintech sector more broadly, including ""the next steps in 'robo-regulation.'""  The statement said that the latter would consist of ""pilot schemes to help new fintech firms, and the financial services industry more widely, comply with regulations by building software which would automatically ensure they follow the rules, saving them time and money.""  Likewise, the statement revealed the government's intention to create a U.K.-Australia ""fintech bridge,"" which will aim to connect the countries' respective markets and to ""help U.K. firms expand internationally.""  Other notable features of the Fintech Sector Strategy include the creation of standards to make it easier for fintech firms to partner with banks.  The statement also indicates the government plans to collaborate with fintech companies to ""create 'shared platforms' which will help remove the barriers that these firms face.""  It did not provide further detail regarding the nature of these platforms.  The U.K. government has largely proved amenable to blockchain technology broadly, but it has shown less enthusiasm for cryptocurrency.  At January's World Economic Forum, Prime Minister Theresa May said she was concerned about potential criminal usage of crypto. At the same event, Hammond called for the regulation of cryptocurrencies.  Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, made a similar appeal for regulation at the beginning of March during a speech at the Scottish Economics Conference.

42428695,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdVdh,1521680514,Polkadot's Plan for Governing a Blockchain of Blockchains,"Who has the authority to change a public blockchain?  It's a question that has been in the minds of top cryptocurrency developers as the many available networks struggle to serve their diverse, often conflicting stakeholders. But that's not to say there aren't norms and best practices – the ability to make and enforce software changes is generally split between the developers that write the code and the computers, or nodes, that install it.  However, Gavin Wood, ethereum co-founder and one of the leaders of an upcoming blockchain interoperability protocol called Polkadot, is shaking up the status quo with a newly published playbook that designates management power directly to token holders.  Distributed in a token sale last year, DOT, the internal token of the Polkadot network, allows its holders to vote directly on a piece of code, which will then automatically upgrade across the network. A way of bypassing the relationship between developers and nodes, the method is not without its controversy, but according to advocates, it’s a step up from what is on offer in most blockchains today.  “This initial proposal for Polkadot governance definitely tries to address the shortcomings of many existing chains, which ended up with community deadlock or continuous splits,” Peter Czaban, director of the Web3 foundation, which sponsors the research and development of Polkadot, told CoinDesk.  Stepping back, the problem of governance is at the forefront of the ethereum today, as tension concerning fund recovery has raised critiques of the effectiveness of the platform’s processes.  “We might have solved consensus for what happens on the chain, but we're still woefully inadequate at solving consensus for what happens to the chain,” Gavin Wood said in an interview.  Since the Parity fund freeze in November (which froze some $176 million of the Polkadot token sale), efforts to recover and redistribute funds have largely fallen silent. According to Wood, this is due in part to the absence of a clear process for measuring the consent for, and enacting, controversial changes.  Wood told CoinDesk:  ""Recent challenges in ethereum governance have made it clear that regardless of the specific feelings of community members, it is extremely important to have a clear process for making any irregular protocol changes, be they feature additions or bug fixes.""  Clarity of process  And it's this need for a formality that, in part, drove the conception of the Polkadot governance method.  In the long-anticipated blockchain of blockchains, every change to the protocol, even minor changes, must undergo a voting referendum in which DOT owners vote on a piece of code.  “It’s possible to be able to vote directly on the piece of code that will replace the previous piece of code, and removes any sort of ambiguity in terms of what the change will actually imply,” Czaban explained.  These votes work in tandem with a council that can block malicious proposals, as well as leaning the vote if a larger portion of DOT holders are absent. Then, given a majority vote, the Polkadot code base will shift.  In part, the formal method was needed due to the differences between Polkadot and a more conventional blockchain. Instead of nodes, Polkadot consists of “validators,” “nominators,” “collators” and “fishermen,” each securing the network in different ways.  While some of these resemble a typical blockchain node, because of the technical nature of Polkadot - the heart of the code is self-defining - they’re not responsible for adopting changes.  “Validators are powerless to block a change that they personally don't agree with nor are they able to hold the network to ransom,” Wood said.  According to Czaban, the use of DOT token holders within this framework was largely a practical choice, and he emphasized, one that could evolve into the future.  “There are many different potentially parties that might be involved in the ecosystem, however, the stakeholders are really the only well quantifiable party that we have at our disposal,” Czaban said.  Coin-holder controversies  Token distribution, therefore, has emerged as a major lightning rod.  Half of all DOT tokens were sold in October, with the remaining tokens split between the Web3 Foundation and 20 percent allocated for further distributions.  Because control of the network is pegged to this distribution, as well as an elected council that has the power to veto certain changes, ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir told CoinDesk that he has his suspicions about how the idea will work in practice.  “I'm not an expert on their governance model, but I've had enough of a look to definitively disapprove,"" he said.  At the ethereum community conference, EthCC, last week, Zamfir presented his ongoing research on governance, a key line of inquiry alongside the construction of ethereum’s proof-of-stake protocol, Casper.  A vocal critic of what is called “on-chain governance,"" Zamfir has written that automated methods of decision-making deny node operators an important role, and as such are “antithetical to the ethos of public blockchains.”  In an email to CoinDesk, Zamfir explained, “I don't trust coin holders and don't think they should be more explicitly in charge than any other community members.”  However, Wood is unswayed, telling CoinDesk that token holders have an economic incentive to act in the best interests of the network.  “Stakeholders have a very clear and broad incentive to do what's right for the network, which essentially means driving the price up,” Wood argued. “It's also unreasonable to believe that node operators are somehow experts on protocol changes.”  A good start  Regardless of controversies, the Polkadot governance method has been designed so it can be easily adapted, and this is where its creators believe the key value-add will be.  “This is a very pragmatic proposal,” Czaban told CoinDesk, “Something that we can do, we can implement, using what we have right now.”  While token holders are the easiest participant to quantify, the governance process could extend to include others in the future.  “As there is more research and understanding into the different mechanisms for governance, and who are the different parties that we might be involved, those can be included,” Czaban continued.  The Web3 foundation will also be supporting the next meeting of the Ethereum Magicians in Berlin in July, which as detailed by CoinDesk, is a group of ethereum developers seeking to redefine the process of making changes to the platform.  ""We are definitely very interested in trying to drill more deeply into the topic of governance,"" Czaban said.  For now though, Czaban told CoinDesk:  “We need to start experimenting, we need to start coming up with concrete proposals. And this is a proposal that covers the majority of the basis and seems like a good start.”  Buttons via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | RESEARCH | TOKEN SALE,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2018/03/22/polkadots-plan-for-governing-a-blockchain-of-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e75e35e8eecdb494d9fa6cb12584589aef4cfbe-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
