Carmack is co-founder of American video game development company id Software and is best known for his innovations in 3D graphics. He was the lead programmer of the id video games Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Quake, Rage and their sequels.  Yesterday, he was asked by a Twitter user to share his thoughts on bitcoin and other digital currencies, his response was largely positive.    @Ripper__X I have paid a little attention for a couple years, but I only did my first purchases this last month. I am guardedly excited.      — John Carmack (@ID_AA_Carmack) January 31, 2014    This wasn't the first time the CTO at gaming technology company Oculus VR has mentioned bitcoin on Twitter, back in December he revealed he had finally read Satoshi Nakamoto's original white paper on bitcoin.  The paper, titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, was published in 2008 announcing the concept of the digital currency.    Finally read http://t.co/IKrCkQztRE . Reading the source code goes on the pile of wish-I-had-time-for projects.      — John Carmack (@ID_AA_Carmack) December 30, 2013    On 22nd January, the 43-year-old expressed his annoyance the fact the power of the bitcoin mining network is sometimes quoted in Floating-point Operations Per Second (Flops), so it can be compared with the power of supercomputers.  Earlier this week, he revealed he had donated bitcoin to The OpenBSD Foundation, which supports the development and maintenance of free software based on the OpenBSD operating system.  This is a Unix-like computer operating system descended from Berkeley Software Distribution.  He had the option to pay via PayPal, but opted instead to pay in bitcoins via BitPay.    I had a bitcoin moment recently -- wanted to give OpenBSD some money, balked at PayPal, then noticed bitcoin could be used.      — John Carmack (@ID_AA_Carmack) January 27, 2014    By donating to the foundation in bitcoin, Carmack is ensuring it doesn't lose out on any of the amount donated. If he had paid via PayPal, it's likely the foundation would have to pay a fee of between 1.4% and 3.4% on the total donation amount plus a fixed fee.

42425388,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwPLh,1391259784,Charlie Shrem's Arrest: Government Harassment or Necessary Law Enforcement?,"The internet has brought about decentralization of information. Now bitcoin is bringing about the decentralization of money.  It’s still early days, but right now it is clear some people are, unfortunately, using BTC for extreme wrongdoing.  Although the government’s own US dollar is also used for criminal activity, the authorities still have to go after bad bitcoin actors with perseverance.  Charlie Shrem and the allegations  Charlie Shrem, whom Time Magazine recently called a “bitcoin big shot”, has some serious legal problems.  It’s been made clear the crimes that Shrem is alleged to have committed were threefold: one count of conspiring to commit money laundering, one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and one count of wilfully failing to file a suspicious activity report.  This type of reporting is something Shrem was responsible for as a compliance officer for his company BitInstant. The company helped customers move USD into bitcoin, acting as a third-party processor for BTC-specific transactions.  It was Shrem's responsibility to report any suspicious financial activities on BitInstant to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), an arm of the US Treasury.  Instead, he knowingly helped a co-conspirator Robert Faiella, who was going under the name “BTCKing”. Faiella basically operated an unlicensed bitcoin exchange in order to facilitate the purchase of illegal goods on Silk Road, where BTC was the only accepted form of payment.  Shrem’s “harrassment”  It doesn’t make sense, then, that someone like Rick Falkvinge could call the Shrem case a “harassment arrest”.  Falkvinge, whose professional work consists of being a political evangelist of the Pirate Party and the pirate movement in general, is basically sensationalizing this highly complex matter.  “This is a harassment arrest apparently intended to intimidate and associate ‘bitcoin’, ‘silk road’, ‘drugs’, and ‘money laundering’ with each other,” Falkvinge writes on his website.  Based on the complaint that the federal government has compiled, Shrem knew what he was doing in regards to his relationship with Faiella. If the allegations are true, it's Shrem's fault bitcoin, silk road, drugs and money laundering have again been linked.  The reality is, it is Shrem’s alleged negligence, not the government's actions, that got him into his current precarious position.  Defining money laundering  There’s not much Falkvinge can do except offer his own revisionist version of what money laundering means in order to prove his point:  “Money laundering is specifically when you take actions to turn black money into white, and not when you sell white money to somebody else and they turn it black without your consent.""  That’s perhaps too specific a definition that is tailored to his agenda. According to FinCEN, money laundering:  “Involves disguising financial assets so they can be used without detection of the illegal activity that produced them.”  It appears that Falvinge is twisting the definition towards his own ideals.  The customer’s customer  During the regulatory panel at the North American Bitcoin Conference, Carol Van Cleef, a partner at law firm Patton Boggs, talked about the issues banks have with keeping in check their “customer’s customer”.  The reasoning for this is simple. In his criminal case, Shrem was supposedly safeguarding Faiella, which was the customer’s customer of BitInstant’s cash payment processor.  Shrem allegedly enabled Faiella to remain anonymous and obtain bitcoins for people looking to buy drugs on the Silk Road black marketplace.  If the allegations are true, that’s disguising financial assets, which is what FinCEN is consistently trying to root out of the system.  As the compliance officer of BitInstant, he should have at least filed a suspicious activity report about Faiella, which he did not do.  “This had nothing to do with bitcoin; it appears to have had everything to do with ignoring your responsibilities as a chief compliance officer and failing to monitor and report certain transactions that would have triggered suspicious activity reports under the BSA [Bank Secrecy Act],” said Andy Beal, an attorney with Crowley Strategy who has reviewed the complaint himself.  Indeed, the unsealing of the documents by the the United States Attorneys Office make clear it was Shrem’s job specifically to comply with the BSA.  That Act gives FinCEN the authority under the auspices of the US Treasury to “determine emerging trends and methods in money laundering and other financial crimes”, according to the FinCEN website.  The community  “Drug law enforcement’s job is to investigate and identify those who abet the illicit drug trade at all levels of production and distribution including those lining their own pockets by feigning ignorance of any wrong doing and turning a blind eye,” the government’s press release that came out announcing the arrest of Shrem and Faiella pointed out.  People have claimed financial crimes have no victims. The problem is usually that these crimes are often so abstract it is difficult to pinpoint the exact injustice a person is caused through financial subterfuge. But the reality is, this isn't always true.  Sure, it’s sometimes hard to directly identify a person that has suffered because of the cleansing of illegal money, but in the Charlie Shrem case, there actually are a number of people who are obviously affected within the bitcoin community.  Shrem was vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation. According to his Twitter feed, he was regularly speaking at events evangelizing bitcoin and he was supposed to speak in Miami at the recent North American Bitcoin Conference.  Bitcoin has a long way to go to reach credibility to a mainstream audience. As a result, Shrem’s alleged crimes are a detriment to everyone who is trying to build positive rapport within the cryptocurrency space.  There is a likelihood that more people will be charged with crimes that use these currencies as a tool for illegal activity.  Undercover agents were buying bitcoin from ""BTCKing"" Robert Faiella as far back as August of 2012. There can be no illusions that the government is still conducting undercover operations to root out BTC-related criminal activity, just look at what the government’s press release announcing Shrem's arrest said:  “We will aggressively pursue those who would coopt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.”  That includes bitcoin, whether people like it or not.  Money on line image via Shutterstock  A previous version of this article stated Shrem was arrested on Monday 27th January. The press release from the Southern District of New York states the arrest took place the previous day.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/01/charlie-shrems-arrest-government-harassment-or-necessary-law-enforcement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ddaa4c2fadc2ea831de43950875c2f7fc9d193c-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425384,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwPBh,1391249876,Bitcoin Micropayments Get Big Moment as Chicago Sun-Times Paywall Experiment Goes Live,"Readers who visit the Chicago Sun-Times today will notice something they aren't likely to have seen before: a bitcoin paywall separating them from their content.  The Chicago Sun-Times is the ninth-largest newspaper in the United States, and the first major US publication to trial a bitcoin paywall.  Instead of paying for a subscription, as patrons of the The Wall Street Journal or the Financial Times do, Chicago Sun-Times readers who visit the site on 1st February will be asked to donate bitcoin payments to the Taproot Foundation, or tweet about the nonprofit, in order to read articles.  The paywall is part of a 24-hour trial that marks the largest, most high-profile partnership to date for BitWall, a San Francisco-based micropayments startup, and the biggest test to date for bitcoin micropayments. However, if BitWallhttp://www.bitwall.io/ and the Sun-Times are able to succeed in their goals, this may be something newshounds will be seeing a lot more.  Speaking to CoinDesk about the announcement, CEO and co-founder Nic Meliones reiterated the importance of the trial for his roughly one-year-old company and for the ecosystem:  ""I think that this has definitely given us the chance to prove that we can launch full-time with large-scale publishers. That's why this partnership was so huge for us.""  Behind the partnership  Though BitWall is a young company, Meliones said it was the Sun-Times that reached out to his team at the beginning of December. A meeting was arranged, and Meliones and his team gave a successful demo showing the capabilities of BitWall.  Jim Kirk, editor-in-chief of the Sun-Times, told CoinDesk his publication had been exploring new ways to monetize content for several months before the meeting.  ""We were interested in BitWall's ability to combine the frictionless currency and social media test in a very efficient way,"" Kirk said.  Within a few days, both parties agreed they wanted to move forward, however, it was the Sun-Times that suggested proceeds from the trial go to the Taproot Foundation, a nonprofit that offers professional marketing, management and other similar services to companies with social focuses. The partnership was revealed earlier this January, and today, site visitors can donate $0.25, $5, $20 or an amount of their choosing to pass the paywall.  While this doesn't exactly allow BitWall to deliver on its main use case - monetization - Meliones said he loves the concept of working for a greater good.  ""It really worked out well. Here's an opportunity to infuse new technology into one of the largest newspapers in the US, but in a way that can support other initiatives that are going on,"" said Meliones.  Project goals  Despite the short duration of this test, Meliones said the trial will be instrumental in helping his company collect data about how consumers use his product. The main focus for both parties, the exec said, will be data collection and information gathering.  ""What we want to do is, as soon as we have that data, we can look into what are the actual insights we can gather from that in terms of engaging with the product and how people are using the payment styles and how people are donating tweets,"" said Meliones.  Meliones said this review will help BitWall as it seeks to improve its product and convince more publishers that the time for accepting bitcoin is now.  For the Sun-Times, the goal is to explore how readers will respond to new services, and determine whether an alternative paywall will be right for them in the long run.  ""We are very interested in seeing how our readers engage, especially as it relates to social media as a way to gain access to content,"" Kirk said.  Forward-thinking publishers  Should the Chicago Sun-Times pursue full bitcoin acceptance, it would be among the first major publishers to do so. This January, Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad announced that it would soon accept bitcoin payments, and while some cryptocurrency-specific sites accept tips, none charge for bitcoin in a more formal way.  NRC Handelsblad's decision garnered mixed reactions from its readers, with some reddit readers indicating its system for processing the transactions may cause complications.  That trial also works similarly to existing traditional paywalls, as it asks readers to pay for a certain amount of credit for content, rather than on an article-by-article basis.  Micropayments seek big break  The test will also be a major test case for micropayments. In contrast to credit, debit and PayPal, which can charge a high cost for smaller payments, bitcoin allows for low-cost transactions, meaning many of its supporters believe it could be the key to unlocking previously untapped online spending.  “Microtransactions is a really interesting use-case. And if done properly, it can be the driving force behind bitcoin adoption,” Ankur Nandwani, a lead developer at microtransactions platform BitMonet, told CoinDesk.  Angel investor Jeremy Liew named micropayments among the benefits of bitcoin at the New York Department of Financial Services hearings in New York this week. Further, regulators seemed receptive to this selling point, as The New York Times was noted as a company that could benefit from an ability to monetize its content in more diverse ways.  As for whether the Sun-Times will become the publication that opens up the industry for bitcoin, Kirk is still unsure, saying ""it's early"" for a decision. However, he did express that his company could be interested in further experimentation.  ""We hope to gain a little bit of information with this test that might guide more testing in the future,"" Kirk said.

42425373,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwOrh,1391212813,Bank Stops Working With Bitcoin Exchange CampBX Due to 'Regulatory Uncertainty',"US bitcoin trading platform CampBX has announced that it has temporarily halted automated clearing house (ACH) and wire transfers effective 31st January.      Alpharetta, GA-based CampBX indicated in a blog post to its users that its bank has ""made a business decision to not work with bitcoins and bitcoin companies"". The bank cited regulatory uncertainty, as well as recent negative bitcoin news, as the driving force behind the decision.      Unfortunately we have some bad news regarding our ACH and WIRE processor. Please see the update here: https://t.co/R0p8WWfYa0      — CampBX - Bitcoin (@CampBX) January 31, 2014      The decision is notable as CampBX became the first bitcoin website to obtain Payment Card Industry (PCI) certification in 2011, signifying that it implements specified controls and safeguards to protect consumer data. CampBX allows for quick buy and sell trades, provides customers with SMS notifications and secures its platform with two-factor authentication, its website says.      The company moved to also calm user concerns, stating that ""all USD and BTC balances are accounted for"", and recommending that users ""purchase bitcoins and withdraw them to their personal wallets"" until standard services resume.      ""We are working to find a replacement partner and resume these two services for our customers. In the meantime, please use alternate deposit or withdrawal methods available on CampBX,"" the company wrote.            Regulation of exchanges    CampBX has tried to stay compliant with traditional financial service regulations, and the news is likely to further calls for regulatory clarity around such bitcoin businesses. Bitcoin investors lobbied for that at the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) hearings this week, saying that a lack of a clear stance on this issue is pushing exchanges, and US jobs and business, abroad.      By day two, regulators seemed to have warmed to the idea of a New York-based exchange and to implementing the kind of regulations that would lead to its creation.      ""Any regulation should help to secure cryptocurrencies and the wallets used to hold them."" - Charles Lee at the New York bitcoin hearings      — CoinDesk (@coindesk) January 28, 2014    Potential partners    Just which bank will join up with CampBX despite the regulatory uncertainty around its business is unclear, however, if past examples are any indication, CampBX may be able to find a partner.      Web payments service OKPAY suspended its support for virtual currencies at the request of its bank last April. This January, though, it was able to resume some services to the virtual currency community in the UK after it found a new partner.
