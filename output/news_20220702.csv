Key technical points: The DOGE prices attempt to cross above the 20-day EMA. The price action shows a high likelihood of a price jump to $0.10. The 24-hour trading volume of Dogecoin is $373 Million, indicating a rise of 27%. Past Performance of DOGE A recent decline in DOGE price is halted at the joint support of $0.63 and slightly under the 20-day EMA. However, the price has been hovering near these levels for almost a week, and the long-tail rejection in the daily candles indicates the possibility of a reversal.

However, traders hoping to ride the breakout rally must wait for the price action confirmation. The 20-day EMA breakout has been a crucial bullish milestone for Dogecoin buyers this quarter, teasing a potential uprising.

Top 5 DeFi Tokens of the Week 1. ThorChain Based on Tendermint and Cosmos SDK, ThorChain is a decentralized cross-chain liquidity system.

Past Performance of CRV The long-term trend of CRV&apos;s downtrend price has reversed to $0.55 to contest the resistance from the 20-day EMA.

Bitcoin Actual/Realized Price Ratio Currently Has A Value Of 0.8 As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, historical data of this BTC ratio may have interesting implications for the current market. The realized cap is a capitalization model for Bitcoin that multiplies each coin in the circulating supply with the price at which the coin was last moved and takes the sum of all the values. This is different from the usual market cap, where the entire supply is simply multiplied by the current price of BTC to get the capitalization. Now, from this realized cap, a &apos;realized price&apos; can also be obtained by dividing the metric with the total amount of coins in circulation.

42374407,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZNND,1656787407,Three Arrows Paper Trail Leads to Trading Desk Obscured Via Offshore Entities,"The epic collapse (and now bankruptcy case) of the once-mighty crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital has roiled the digital-asset industry and contributed to a record first-half tumble in bitcoin's (BTC) price.  Yet, for investors and enforcers following the money trail, the arrows point to an obscure legal entity that has so far mostly remained out of the headlines – while still aggressively trading – and possibly shielding some assets from recovery.  While Three Arrows Capital used its tens of billions of dollars of assets under management to invest in new projects and take large market positions, it also operated an over-the-counter trading desk called Tai Ping Shan (TPS) Capital. The entity was once described on LinkedIn as ""the official OTC desk of Three Arrows Capital,"" according to a scraped version of the site by Google, but the language has since been changed, distancing the two firms.  TPS Capital continues to make trades, according to sources in the digital asset industry in Asia, even as its parent company faces liquidation in the British Virgin Islands and an investigation in Singapore.  For those seeking restitution from Three Arrows Capital via a lawsuit, the legal separation may complicate efforts to obtain a payout. Named after the Tai Ping Shan mountain on the island of Hong Kong, TPS Capital is registered in Singapore but domiciled in the British Virgin Islands. The parent company is now facing a lawsuit but, according to corporate filings, TPS Capital has a different ownership structure and hidden directors.  According to registration documents filed in Singapore, TPS Capital’s ownership is split between a BVI-registered firm called Three Lucky Charms Ltd, BVI-registered TPS Research and Cayman Islands-registered Tai Ping Shan Ltd.  While BVI law holds that the names of directors of a company isn’t public information, the name Three Lucky Charms rings like Three Arrows Capital, whose three principals are Su Zhu, Kyle Davies and a third individual whose identity isn’t clear.  TPS Research, which owns 47.5% of TPS Capital’s Singapore entity, also keeps its directors hidden from the public, as allowed under BVI law.  Caymans-registered Tai Ping Shan, which owns 5% of the Singapore entity TPS Capital, lists Paul Muspratt, the managing director of West Bay Global Services, a corporate services provider, as one of its directors, alongside Steven Sokohl, another West Bay employee, and Yi Long Fung.  Yi doesn’t have much of a presence online. He is listed as a director of TPS Capital’s Canadian-registered entity, which operates by the same name and was founded in February 2022. It lists an address in the Toronto suburb of Thornhill.  Where’s Three Arrows’s money?  For a fund that was touted to be managing billions of dollars, Three Arrows’s filings with the Singaporean government show a paltry income that would suggest management of a significantly smaller amount.  According to a return filed for the 2020 fiscal year end, Three Arrows Singapore reported it had S$3.3 million (US$2.36 million) in total assets, and claimed a S$1.15 million ($823,015) profit for the year. Some S$6.33 million was paid out in dividends to Zhu and Davies.  Three Arrows’ 2021 year-end filing is not available.  Three Arrows’ Singapore and Three Arrows’ BVI units split the purchase of Three Arrows’ December 2020 position in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings. The Singapore entity was licensed to manage S$250 million ($179 million), according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  A Singapore-based person involved in the institutional digital assets industry, who spoke to CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity, said TPS held and traded most of Three Arrows’ treasury. Another person, in a similar position at an Asia-based institutional crypto firm, also speaking with CoinDesk on a condition of anonymity, said that TPS is “where the action was” for Three Arrows.  Singapore’s authorities are not impressed  Earlier this week the Monetary Authority of Singapore censured Three Arrows for misreporting information about the size of its holdings and issued a reprimand.  “The reprimand relates to contraventions by [Three Arrows Capital] which occurred prior to its notification to MAS in April 2022. MAS has been investigating these contraventions since June 2021,” MAS wrote. Three Arrows provided ""misleading"" information, according to the regulator.  MAS also wrote: “In light of recent developments which call into question the solvency of the fund managed by [Three Arrows Capital], MAS is assessing if there were further breaches.”  But while Three Arrows has filed for bankruptcy in New York (it has yet to declare bankruptcy in Singapore as of July 2), TPS continues to use capital to trade, the people with information said.  The question is, can regulators or plaintiffs in the suit pierce the corporate veil between the two firms?  LinkedIn changed  Descriptions of TPS Capital on LinkedIn appear to have been changed to eliminate an apparent connection to Three Arrows Capital.

4255,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=241700,1656784196,DOT Technical Analysis: Polkadot Trades Bearishly on the Short-Term Basis,"Key Technical Points: DOT technical analysis is bearish for today. DOT/USD pair is currently trading at $6.70. Polkadot found support at $6.62. Past Performance of DOT With the sell-off driving DOT market value down to $6.62, the cryptocurrency is down by over 4% in the last 24 hours. However, it is still up by over 50% since the beginning of the month. The past performance of DOT is a good indicator of how the cryptocurrency might perform in the future. Source- Tradingview DOT Technical Analysis The 4-hour chart shows that the DOT/USD trades below the 20-day moving average (MA) and the 50-day MA. This suggests that the bearish trend will likely continue in the short term. The RSI is currently at 42, which indicates that the market is neither oversold nor overbought. The market value is likely to continue falling as the sell-off continues. However, the cryptocurrency might find strong support below $6.0. Once the market value stabilizes, it will likely consolidate in a sideways range before beginning an upward trend. The MACD and signal lines display a bearish crossover, which is another indication that the market value is likely to fall in the short term. In summary, the DOT/USD pair is bearish in the short term. Upcoming Trend If the market value of DOT breaks below $6.0, it will likely fall to $5.50 in the short term. On the other hand, if the market value rises above $7.0, it is likely to rise to $7.50 in the short term.Th...",NEGATIVE,DOT,DOT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/dot-technical-analysis-polkadot-trades-bearishly-on-the-short-term-basis/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dot-technical-analysis-polkadot-trades-bearishly-on-the-short-term-basis,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

That compares with bitcoin&apos;s (BTC-USD) second-worst half in 2018 (-54.7%) when retail investors jumped out of the world&apos;s largest digital token by market cap as quickly as they hopped in it, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Since bitcoin&apos;s (BTC-USD) peak of $68.8K in November, the token has since fallen around 65%. Some $2T of global crypto market cap vanished, bringing it down to just $853.9B as of June 30, as per CoinMarketCap. The slump in crypto comes in the wake of shrinking liquidity and tighter financial conditions.

In fact, buyers could not organize a rebound of the price upwards and correct the local fall wave from April 2022. Although everything started quite well. On 30 May, buyers absorbed the previous candle of sellers and gave a hint about the readiness to continue the growth of the ADA price to $0.93. The new trading month completely beat all odds and narrowed the ADA consolidation range to 10%. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/3563ihyj/ Now, sellers are trying to break the lower limit of consolidation - $0.44 mark. If the price is successfully fixed below $0.44 on the weekly timeframe, sellers will open their way to the next target of $0.33. This mark on the history shows that the ADA price stopped for about 4 weeks before continuing its crazy uptrend. Of course, a stop for 4 weeks is an indicator of a strong liquidity zone. However, the fact that the approaching of the ADA price to the $0.33 mark caused problems for sellers indicates a high probability of a reversal from this mark. This is our negative scenario.

The difficulties Mexican residents encounter while attempting to obtain financial products and education serve as the basis for the bill&apos;s action. However, the Central Bank of Mexico has opposed the integration of bitcoin into the nation&apos;s financial system. Bitcoin Accepted in Mexico as Legal Tender Another country in Latam looking into the potential benefits bitcoin could have for its economy is Mexico. A bill to change Mexico&apos;s existing monetary law and make bitcoin legal tender was unveiled this week by senator Indira Kempis. The proposal, which aims to follow El Salvador&apos;s lead in becoming the first nation in the world to accept bitcoin as legal cash, highlights how this could alter the financial literacy of many residents. The study bases its recommendation on Mexico being one of the continent&apos;s least educated and financially inclusive nations. Over 67 million individuals in Mexico still do not have access to a bank account, meaning that 56% of the country&apos;s population still does not have these most fundamental financial tools.

42374380,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZNAd,1656752400,What Traders Are Saying About Bitcoin's Biggest Monthly Loss in 11 Years,"Bitcoin slid almost 38% in June to record its second-biggest monthly loss since its debut in 2009. It traded over $31,000 on June 1 and dropped to as low as $17,700 mid-month, before recovering and ending the month at $19,209, according to CoinGecko data.  The monthly decline is second only to bitcoin's plunge of 38.6% in August 2011, and pushed prices below 2017's highs.  June's losses came amid declining macroeconomic sentiment, fears of inflation and systemic risks from within the crypto ecosystem, such as the possible insolvency of crypto lender Celsius Network and the blowup of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.  “The losses were caused by many factors,"" said Ali Kassab, chairman of crypto investment firm Centurion & Co. “These included monetary policies bordering on central banks' response to rising inflation fueled by COVID-19 and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war.  ""From Terra’s collapse to the liquidation of Three Arrows Capital and unending layoffs, the bad trend in the crypto industry weighed down the price of bitcoin,” Kassab added, noting he expected institutional investments “to pour into the asset” and create ""better price performance"" in July.  Prices to ‘range’  Others such as Chris Terry of lending platform SmartFi say they expect bitcoin to trade in a fairly narrow range in the short term. “The feeling of the trading desk is that if bitcoin stays in the $18,000 to $20,000 [range], it's going to be a long drawn out, and we could be in this trading range now for weeks,” he said.  “Everybody kind of feels that bitcoin needs to wash out and take out all the short positions and reset, which would be probably the full 80% retracement, which is typical in the markets, which would be down in the $12,000 to $13,000 range,” Terry added.  At press time the largest cryptocurrency was changing hands around $19,200, up 0.3% over the past 24 hours.  Central bankers renewed fears of rate hikes among investors earlier this week at the European Central Bank’s annual forum. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's commitment to increasing interest rates to curtail inflation.  Speaking at the ECB meeting, Powell said he was more concerned about the challenge posed by inflation than about the possibility that higher interest rates could push the U.S. economy into a recession.  Powell said the Fed had to raise rates rapidly, Reuters reported, adding that a gradual increase could cause consumers to feel that higher prices of commodities would persist. About a week ago, his comments suggested rate hikes could soften before next year.  Searching for a bottom  Such an outlook has caused some to opine that bitcoin hasn't hit a bottom yet, although many are optimistic it will eventually recover and surge to new highs.  “I don’t think BTC has hit the bottom yet, but I am sure the bull market will come back,” said Jimmy Zhao, founder of crypto exchange ZBX. “I recommend buying bitcoin while the price is low and holding on to it, because in the next bull run, its price will hit $100,000 at least.”  Acquiring bitcoin on the cheap and holding on until the next cycle is a sentiment shared by others in the industry.  “Indicators show the market is in extreme fear condition, [with] some long-term holders capitulating and businesses defaulting,” said Anton Gulin, business director at crypto exchange AAX. “However, it’s neither the first nor the last bear cycle, and those with better long-term operational planning see it as an opportunity to build and prepare for the next bull run.  “When someone sells, it’s always someone who’s buying. I expect a continued shift of liquidity and a series of mergers and acquisitions in the coming months,” Gulin added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/02/what-traders-are-saying-about-bitcoins-biggest-monthly-loss-in-11-years,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/471682b0e232706d6ffcf7267ff90b757d59293a-544x408.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
