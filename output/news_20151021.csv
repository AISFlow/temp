42398759,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXc1,1445452608,FATF: Virtual Currencies Could Fuel Terrorism Financing,"Bitcoin may pose a risk for terrorist financing, according to a new report from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  In a report entitledEmerging Terrorist Financing Risks, released today, the organisation notes that virtual currencies have ""attracted the attention of various criminal groups"", including extremist organizations.  However, while their use among terror organisations could grow in the short-term, the scale of the threat they pose is unknown and should be researched further, it says.  ""This report presents a number of interesting cases, but the actual prevalence and level of exploitation of these technologies by terrorist groups and their supporters is not clear at this time and remains an ongoing information gap to be explored.""  One of FATF's primary concerns in this area are foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs), who it says make up one of the main forms of ""material support"" for terrorist groups.  While FTFs are, for the most part, being financed via traditional avenues, the report flags evidence that bitcoin is being discussed as a means to purchase arms and fund ""global extremist efforts"".  The full report can be found here.  About FATF  Founded in 1989, FATF is an international 'policy making' body that sets regulatory standards for tackling money laundering, terrorist financing and other threats to the financial system.  Its 36 members, who make up the majority of the biggest economies in the world, meet three times a year at the FATF Plenary, FATF's decision making body.  In June  it had urged its members to monitor gateways such as bitcoin exchanges to mitigate the threat of money laundering and terrorist financing, having first flagged risks related to the currency during a 2014 report.

42398762,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXey,1445444523,Deloitte: It’s Too Soon for Bitcoin to be Regulated,"Multinational professional services firm Deloitte has questioned whether it is too soon to try and regulate bitcoin.  In a publication titled Bitcoin at the Crossroads – which notes the advantages of both bitcoin and blockchain technology – Deloitte explores whether regulating digital currency could potentially have a negative impact on its future development and potential to reach mass adoption.  It adds:  ""In most respects, while policy makers and regulators are acting in accordance with their mission statement to protect the public and the integrity of the financial markets, an important question comes to the fore – is it too soon to try and regulate bitcoin?""  There is, according to the publication, strong historical evidence which suggests that allowing new technologies to develop without interference is initially the best course of action.  'A drop of water in the ocean'  The publication notes there are three reasons why global policy makers should refrain from regulating bitcoin during its nascent stage.  Firstly, bitcoin's market penetration is still small compared to traditional fiat currency systems and transaction platforms:  ""Bitcoin is receiving a remarkable amount of attention and scrutiny from policy makers and regulators all around the world – far beyond what its current scale and market impact would seem to justify. In fact, by any relevant benchmark, the value currently at risk with bitcoin is just a drop of water in the ocean that is the financial industry.""  The publication then goes on to say that ""we could be cycles away from real products that can generate true demand for bitcoin related services from mainstream consumers"".  Impact on mass adoption  Additionally, the authors say other transformative technologies were given more time to develop before they came under regulatory scrutiny.  Citing the telephone (invented in 1876 and regulated in 1913); airplanes (invented in 1093 and regulated in 1938) and the Internet (invented in 1969 which has come under increased regulatory focus in recent times) as previous examples, it adds:  ""The open-source platform that is bitcoin was first released in 2009. We are a mere six years into the development of bitcoin and a long way away from the time it has typically taken for new technologies to achieve mass adoption in the past.""  Exploring its potential  Finally, the authors note bitcoin has not yet found its most valuable application.  ""While the list of potential use cases for bitcoin and blockchain technology is expanding every day,"" the publication says ""it is still in its early days and some of the emerging use cases are tremendously exciting.""  Acknowledging the challenge that bitcoin poses for regulators, and its potential to disrupt both the financial services and technology industries, the publication concludes there is a case for industry groups, policy makers and regulators to collaborate at a national level.

42398761,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXdz,1445431215,"E-Tailer Offers $23,000 to Catch DDoS Attackers Demanding Bitcoin","A UK e-tailer is offering a $23,181 (£15,000) bounty to catch those who launched a DDoS attack against the firm's site before demanding a bitcoin ransom.  Aria Taheri, the owner and managing director of Aria Technology told CRN his company's website was compromised on Monday afternoon and hackers requested payment of 16.66 bitcoins (approximately $4,433.89).  The company also took to Twitter to advertise its bounty offer:    Remember our website went down yesterday..it was attackers! Help us catch them and we’ll reward you £15000! #retweet pic.twitter.com/wQfJOf0ss7        — Aria PC Technology (@Aria_Technology) October 20, 2015      Speaking to CRN, Taheri added that he would not pay the bitcoin ransom as doing so would encourage mimic attacks and further blackmailing efforts, adding:  ""The message to the hackers is that I will spend a significant amount of money to bring them to justice. Our track record shows that we have done that before, and based on that track record I am fairly confident we can do that [again].""  If unpaid, Taheri said the attackers had threatened to take down the company's site for the whole of today (Wednesday 21st October).  Aria Technology's website was online at the time of press.  Bitcoin ransoms  Earlier this year, extortionist group DD4BC made the headlines as it appeared to be connected to a series of DDoS attacks carried out against various organisations in Switzerland, New Zealand and Australia. At the time, the group requested a ransom of 25 BTC.  A report published by Akamai Technologies – a content delivery network and cloud services provider – in September identified 114 attacks carried out by DD4BC since April.  Two of the biggest banks in Hong Kong were also targeted with DDoS attacks and faced bitcoin ransom demands earlier this year.

42398758,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXb2,1445414404,Jersey Government to Introduce Digital Currency Legislation Next Year,"The government of Jersey is pushing ahead with plans to pass legislation next year that will establish rules for businesses on the island that work with bitcoin and digital currencies.  The Chief Minister’s Department of Jersey released a policy document this morning that outlines how its approach to digital currency regulation will focus on exchanges, ATMs and other services that connect digital currencies with traditional ones.  Notably, the document outlines the government’s desire to avoid creating a full licensure regime, like New York’s BitLicense, given the nascent state of the technology and the companies working with it. Calling such an arrangement “currently premature”, the government went on to write:  “In considering regulatory options, the importance of balancing the protection of the Island from money laundering and terrorist financing risk against stifling innovation and growth in this emerging sector were at the forefront of consideration.”  The policy statement comes months after Jersey’s government kicked off a public comment period regarding its plans. According to the government’s release, it received feedback from 30 respondents and held what it called “an open seminar” that drew 70 participants. The comment period ran between July and August.  In a statement, Jersey’s assistant chief minister, Senator Philip Ozouf, said he was moving to bring draft legislation to the island’s parliament, the States Assembly, in early 2016.  However, he left the door open to a different regulatory approach in the future, suggesting that the government may return to the issue as Jersey seeks to draw in digital currency companies.  “The policy document on regulation should not be viewed as final; it should be viewed as acting as a starting point,” he said. “Based on the responses to the consultation we think this is a good starting point where Jersey can be the chosen location to both allow existing virtual currency business to innovate and grow whilst attracting new business to our shores.”  Focus on money exchangers  The government’s outline lays out how companies on the island that exchange digital and fiat currencies will fall under statutes governing the activities of money services businesses.  It states that companies “acting as an interface between legacy financial systems and virtual currencies, e.g. virtual currency exchanges and Bitcoin ATM operators” will fall under this definition and would be required to register with the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JSFC), the island’s top finance regulator.  Firms that process more than £150,000 in transactions annually will be subject to JFSC oversight, adhering to compliance rules and paying an undisclosed annual fee. Companies that process less than that amount would be classified as exempt and not be required to undergo the registration process, face active oversight or pay the related fees.  The government is planning to put in place a process through which companies that rise above or fall beneath the £150,000 threshold would have their registration reclassified.  According to the policy outline, the JSFC would have regulatory power over exchange services on the island, including the ability to police those who fall below the £150,000 threshold.  “The JFSC will supervise compliance of virtual currency exchangers with the Money Laundering Order and other AML/CFT legislation - except exempted virtual currency exchangers,” the outline states. “However, the JFSC will still have the necessary powers to investigate exempted virtual currency exchangers compliance with the Money Laundering Order and other AML/CFT legislation – as and when necessary.”  The government stated that this approach meets demands for those calling for so-called financial sandboxes, in which startups working on an experimental scale are allowed to operate without scrutiny in regulatory gray areas.  Looking ahead  As part of the effort, the government is forming a new working group in conjunction with Digital Jersey, an industry body based on the island.  The goal of the working group, according to the policy document, is “to monitor the effect of the regulatory policy as technology and the global landscape evolves and also to ensure that industry can communicate with both the JFSC and the Government on the effect of regulation”.  Further, the government is positioning itself to develop future standards for applications of the blockchain beyond payments and digital currencies, stating:  “The Government acknowledges the huge potential of distributed ledger technology to change the future of finance. Whilst no clear route forward in respect of a standard appears to exist at this point in time, we are conscious that the area should be actively monitored in order to ensure that the Island is equipped to adapt to opportunities offered by this emerging area.”  According to the outline, while initial discussions took place regarding such standards, disagreement over what they might look like or how they would evolve over time given the early days of the technology led to a decision to hold off for now. Further investigation on this front is set to be conducted in conjunction with JFSC and Digital Jersey.
