42396266,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1yUV,1641421924,"Australian Open Apes Into Tennis NFTs and Decentraland, Too","The Australian Open is taking a swing at the metaverse with a pair of blockchain-related announcements on Thursday, becoming the first Grand Slam tennis tournament to do so.  The famed tourney is releasing a collection of 6,776 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that correspond to action on the court and will host a virtual event for the competition on the metaverse platform Decentraland.  Every winning shot from the tournament’s 600 matches will correspond to one of the collection’s NFTs. Owners will receive an airdrop with footage of the point, virtual wearables and Australian Open merchandise, according to a press release.  The data pulled to match the NFTs will come from the same electronic line-calling technology used to judge the matches’ in-game points.  “It’s probably gotten way too deep at this point,” the project’s lead Ridley Plummer told CoinDesk while describing how it designed each of the balls’ fuzz to be unique. “But it’s what we signed up for.”  If the winning point happens to be in a championship match, the NFT owner will be delivered the physical ball in a custom engraved case. Court location for each NFT will be determined after the collection’s minting, which will take place on Jan. 13 for 0.067 ETH (roughly $350) apiece.  Metaverse too  The event’s Decentraland party will run throughout the tournament, which begins on Jan. 17, and will include challenges for fans to compete for virtual prizes.  Plummer told CoinDesk that the setup will bring “a warm Australian summer vibe through the computer screen,” and won’t be the last virtual event hosted by the tournament.  Big picture  As the pandemic continues to thwart many in-person gatherings, virtual events like the Australian Open’s could become more commonplace. The owner of One Times Square recently threw a New Year’s party in Decentraland, attended by metaverse early adopters from around the world.  “We’ve always been known as one of the most innovative and entertaining events on the calendar,” Plummer told CoinDesk in an interview. “It’s a festival of entertainment as much as a tennis tournament; some people spend eight or nine hours at the Australian Open and don’t even see a tennis ball. Going into the metaverse was the next logical step in that progression.”  The Australian Open teamed up with metaverse design firm Run It Wild for the event’s construction.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MANA | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | AIRDROP,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/05/australian-open-apes-into-tennis-nfts-and-decentraland-too,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c8a727b5b18f9b5e3835b11e43057d1bde82e2a-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396265,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1ySX,1641417757,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Dips as Dominance Over Ethereum Shrinks,"Bitcoin was down about 4% over the past 24 hours along with equities on Wednesday. The intraday sell-off occurred after the U.S. Federal Reserve pointed to a possible interest rate hike in March, which is sooner than many had expected.  But despite the price dip, some analysts expect BTC will stabilize in a range of between $40,000 and $50,000, which could keep volatility low.  Others are looking to alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) such as ETH, LINK, ICP, FTM that have outperformed BTC over the past week.  For example, some decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens that fell out of favor in early 2021 still managed to retain some top spots in terms of total value locked, which represents the number of assets that are staked in a protocol.  “Perhaps as they are considered more battle-tested and a safer store of capital compared to newer competitors,” Delphi Digital wrote in a blog post.  For now, even with altcoins in the spotlight, volatility has declined in both BTC and ETH recently.  “Our view is that this volatility compression is structural and will be a theme for 2022,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram announcement. “With that said, we think this dip in the front-end [of the volatility curve] is overextended and we’re adding long gamma here.”  Traders are “long gamma profit” when the underlying asset moves more than expected.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $43,943, -4.98%  Ether (ETH): $3,592, -5.85%  S&P 500: $4,700, -1.94%  Gold: $1,810, -0.19%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.69%  Bitcoin dominance declines  The bitcoin dominance ratio, or the measure of BTC’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market capitalization, continued to decline toward 39% on Wednesday. The ratio is at the lowest level since April 2018, when cryptocurrencies were in a bear market.  Typically, during periods of market panic, some traders would sell altcoins, which are deemed to be risky. The remaining option for traders is to seek relative safety in BTC, which results in a higher bitcoin dominance ratio.  This time, however, altcoins continue to outperform bitcoin, which suggests investor appetite for risk remains strong.  Ethereum’s market cap getting closer to bitcoin’s  Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is roughly 50% away from overtaking bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency.  Some analysts refer to the battle for crypto’s top crown as “The Flippening.” Over the past year, ether has gained ground versus bitcoin across several metrics, including active addresses, Google search interest and transaction counts.  The rise in ether’s market capitalization suggests investors are looking for potential opportunities for return beyond bitcoin.  “There are hard dates and a hard outline from the Ethereum Foundation to increase the network throughput and lower transaction fees,” Katie Talati, head of research for crypto and blockchain asset management firm Arca, said during an interview on CoinDesk’s “First Mover” show.  Ethereum’s network improvements could be a catalyst to attract more funds to ether versus bitcoin, according to Talati.  Altcoin roundup  The state of Ethereum’s fee market: CoinDesk’s Edward Oosterbaan examined the motivation for EIP 1559 and if after four months, there are any real impacts on the Ethereum blockchain. So far, Coinbase noted it is saving 27 ETH per day from base-fee refunds and faster transaction confirmations by 11 seconds compared with before the London hard fork. On the opposing side, Galaxy Digital’s look into EIP 1559 reported issues due to increased block size (gas limits).  Chainlink (LINK) jumps, outperforming bitcoin: LINK led gains among major cryptocurrencies over the past two days as the broader market showed signs of a recovery. LINK is used to pay for price feeds and other services on Chainlink and has a market capitalization of $12 billion, CoinGecko data show. The price, however, is down 50% from its record of $52 last May.  Algorand enters the metaverse: The Drone Racing League (DRL) and Web 3 game developer Playground Labs have tapped Algorand’s blockchain to create the first play-to-earn drone game in the metaverse, the league announced on Wednesday. While the details are still to be worked out, the league said “players will race DRL drones” (presumably digital ones) for cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens on Algorand. Read more here.

42411578,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOt4s,1641410160,"Facebook, Walmart and How Companies Shouldn’t Set Up in the Metaverse","A clip has been tearing its way around Twitter this week, showing a Walmart-branded demonstration of shopping in “the metaverse.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Reactions from Twitter users have been, in a word, brutal. The demo was “worse than current online shopping in literally every way,” one said. At the most basic level, it would destroy the main benefit of shopping online: not having to navigate store aisles and shelves.  To be clear, this isn’t a new clip: It was produced for SXSW in 2017. Nonetheless, the video does capture the default approach as corporate America works frantically to show that it’s ready for “the metaverse.”  On the surface, the entire premise of this sort of nonsense is that people will enjoy and use inferior metaverse applications just because … 3D is cool, I guess? Certainly, there’s no attention paid to what users actually want or need out of an online shopping experience. On the most basic level, why would you go to the trouble of designing a virtual Walmart that looks … exactly like a physical Walmart? Shopping in a real Walmart is fairly awful. If you’re in a 3D virtual world, maybe take advantage of the literally limitless possibilities to redesign the experience.  Don’t expect anything better as various moribund and existentially terrified organizations trot out their “metaverse applications.” They’re mostly going to be awful, in part out of a pure lack of imagination: Remember, for instance, when newspapers “got on the web” by posting what were essentially PDFs of their print pages?  More importantly, these efforts aren’t really for users in the first place – they’re meant to dazzle investors, especially those in their fifties and above looking for public market opportunities to extract profit from young people. That, of course, was the real point of Facebook’s own rebranding as “Meta,” so we can’t expect any better from the drooling dinosaurs who will inevitably fall into step behind Mark Zuckerberg’s Pied Piper routine.  And it’s likely to end with them all cheerfully shambling off a (virtual?) cliff. That’s exactly what happened with Facebook’s embarrassing, disastrous “pivot to video” circa 2015-2016. The site started telling news organizations to prioritize video, leading companies like Vice, Vocativ and Upworthy to fire print journalists and hire videographers in their place.  Oh yeah, remember Upworthy? Vocativ? If not, maybe it’s because the pivot to video helped nudge them and other outlets further into bankruptcy and collapse by tanking page views. In fact, Facebook’s video push cost hundreds of journalists their jobs (eventually including those newly hired videographers) and badly wounded dozens of news organizations. Partly that was because Facebook didn’t understand its own audience and was wrong about the initial pivot. Partly it was because Facebook then allegedly lied to content creators and advertisers about the views videos were receiving.  And that was just a first draft. By pulling the rest of the tech world along on its farcical effort to sell VR headsets, Facebook is going to trick hundreds of potential competitors into wasting effort and capital on a fundamentally flawed idea.  Divergent visions of the metaverse  The metaverse-shopping clip also highlights confusion and controversy over what exactly the “metaverse” is. As many pointed out around Facebook’s announcement, the term was coined in ‘90s cyberpunk fiction as essentially a synonym for “virtual reality.” But starting around 2017, when no one else was really using the term, devs and theorists around Ethereum started using “metaverse” to refer to a world built on owned digital assets, such as NFTs, usable across a variety of interfaces. Sotheby’s was drawing on this discourse when it launched a “Sotheby’s Metaverse” brand for NFTs, for instance, before Facebook announced its own name change.  See also: The Metaverse We Didn’t Ask For | Opinion  VR wasn’t really part of that blockchain-centric discussion at all, but the discourse did help Facebook co-opt some blockchain clout with its VR rebrand. Facebook already tried this once, with the utter faceplant formerly known as Libra, a would-be “cryptocurrency” (whatever that might have actually meant coming from Zuckerberg) that was so stupidly conceived and poorly thought through that leader David Marcus seemed not just unprepared, but genuinely surprised when members of Congress pressed him on some really obvious problems with the idea.  This is why blockchain and crypto insiders see control of the “metaverse” narrative as a competition between Facebook’s centralized corporate VRscape and a more radical decentralized, open version backed by systems like Decentraland or Ethereum itself.  If Facebook wins that conflict, we’ll have a repeat of exactly the same problem we see with Web 2.0 – if one company controls the backend infrastructure, particularly data-gathering, they face no competitive pressure to improve or innovate on the front-end experience. And have you visited Facebook.com lately? It’s at least as noisy, distracting, unpleasant and inconvenient as your average brick-and-mortar Walmart.  Facebook’s inept and allegedly deceptive handling of both social video and the Libra project should also be a deafening warning klaxon for companies currently pouring millions of dollars into “metaverse” projects. Facebook’s “Meta” rebrand is entirely self-interested, oriented towards selling a few headsets and bamboozling credulous investors. They certainly don’t give a damn about their users, and they don’t care much more about companies dependent on their platforms.

42411586,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOzN2,1641408753,2022 Is the Year of Ethereum,"By Season 13, most TV shows have exhausted all but the most absurd plotlines. Like long-running soap operas, it can be hard to remember who’s mad at whom and why. In the meme-induced fog of propaganda between Bitcoin maximalists and Ethereum boosters, it might be hard to keep track of the big themes, but I believe two overarching ones will shape the world of blockchain in the coming year.  Paul Brody is EY’s global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  First and foremost, 2022 is all about Ethereum. Just about everything innovative and important happening in the world of blockchain right now is happening in the Ethereum ecosystem. I see three key trends driving growth in the Ethereum ecosystem in the coming year.  First, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) represent the future of how communities, missions and enterprises are converging in a single format. While DAOs have been around for a while, I see 2022 as the year in which they start to take center stage as a preferred format for building new entities. This will also be a critical year in which DAO governance will mature, as people get more comfortable exercising their voting power with stakes and delegating their voting power to those who are experts on particular topics. In the long run, this may well kick off a shareholder revolution in traditional markets as well.  Read more: How Ethereum Will Be Transformed in 2022  Second, the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem will continue to integrate with mainstream finance. I predicted (incorrectly) that by the end of 2021, we’d see at least one major existing centralized finance (CeFi) offer users access to the DeFi ecosystem. I renew that prediction for 2022 (better late than never). Additionally, I think we will see the emergence of some decentralized identity management components that add a layer of know your customer (KYC) to DeFi, as providers work to meet regulatory requirements without adding centralization.  Third, and most importantly, the Ethereum ecosystem end game is now visible. Ethereum’s shift to proof of stake and the broader shift of users from layer 1 to layer 2 is now underway. By the end of 2022, Ethereum itself will primarily be a blockchain that is used for other blockchains (layer 2 networks) to interact with each other. The multi-chain future is an Ethereum future.  Read more: Paul Brody - Web 3.0 Is Too Complicated  Nobody should be surprised by this. The internet runs in pretty much the same way. Not only is Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) the standard networking language for the internet, it’s also the standard networking language of nearly all private networks. Early on in the internet era, TCP/IP was used to connect up a very heterogeneous world of networks, including an entire universe of proprietary enterprise protocols such as DECnet, Systems Network Architecture (SNA), XNA, NetWare, VINES and my personal favorite, Token Ring. You can read all about the protocol wars here.  As time went on, networks standardized, and now they are all basically the same – the internet today is mostly TCP/IP networks connecting other TCP/IP networks. Expect a repeating pattern.  Just the start  And this brings me to the second mega-theme of 2022: This is the end of the beginning. There’s a long and glorious future of mass adoption ahead, probably another 10-15 years if the cloud is any guide. What’s come to an end, in my view, is the uncertainty over the primary platforms on which this growth will take place and the biggest, most enduring players in the ecosystem.  The first big winner is the Ethereum ecosystem itself. While there is still a great deal of uncertainty about which ecosystem is likely to win the layer 2 challenges, no matter who wins in layer 2, the Ethereum ecosystem does too. The absolute dominance of Ethereum in both developer skills and participating capital is hard to argue, and I believe it is too late for other platforms to dethrone the king.  The history of technology ecosystems shows that, once a market enters the mass adoption phase, it’s remarkably hard to dislodge the early leaders  The second big winners are the Ethereum-ecosystem native market leaders, especially in DeFi and DAOs, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Every ecosystem needs “killer applications” to drive adoption, and Ethereum has found at least three that will drive adoption and growth for years to come. While we are still in the earliest stages of mass adoption, the enterprises and DAOs that have already established strong positions in these markets are likely to reap the majority of the growth rewards in the coming years.  The history of technology ecosystems shows that once a market enters the mass adoption phase, it’s remarkably hard to dislodge the early leaders. Personal computers, smartphones, networking equipment and cloud computing all show similar patterns: Even a decade or two after they got their start, the early market leaders were still the biggest players, and while successful new entrants still gain traction from time to time, it’s notable mostly because it is so rare. Now think about the biggest DAOs and protocols you know today, and imagine what they will look like after 15 years of 30-50% annual growth. At those growth rates, they could be 50-100 times larger than they are today.  Finally, there’s one more big winner I see coming this year: regulators.  While bash-the-regulator is a fun game to play on social networks, the reality is that all the participants in the ecosystem want clarity on the rules. While it seems chaotic right now, the intense regulatory focus on stablecoins and DeFi signals what are likely to be very positive changes in the year ahead.  There are so many more stories that will accumulate during 2022, and I’m not ignoring them here, but I don’t believe they will shape the year as a whole. No prediction for the future and no good story would be complete without casting someone (or something) in the role of the villain.  While many would like to nominate regulators, I’ve already cast them as the white hats in this story. I think there are two candidates that could play spoiler in 2022. The first is a film classic: zombies. Blockchain Zombies are layer 1 networks that are sitting on piles of cash and haven’t accepted defeat at the hands of Ethereum. They are the Ethereum killers that couldn’t. They’re not ready to go quietly into the night and they will fight irrelevance with big cash outlays to developers. I won’t be surprised at all to find some of them newly re-branding themselves as layer 2 networks under the if-you-can’t-beat-’em-join-’em rule. It’s already happening, but expect these activities to take on a new level of urgency in the coming year.  Read more: Paul Brody - Choosing Who We Trust  The most reliable villain in any blockchain story are the insiders who are already here. This is an industry that’s pioneered on big personalities and fueled with often angry memes. We should never underestimate the risk that we are our own biggest enemies. Our industry has a number of specialties for picking fights we can’t win (with regulators, for example), vicious spats on social media (mostly harmless) and, of course, endless technical battles over obscure details that obstruct progress.

NFTs (aka non-fungible tokens) have disrupted both the investing and art world, making headlines in 2021 for their groundbreaking utility for both creators and investors alike, and they don&apos;t show any signs of slowing down in 2022. In fact, NFTs just had their best year on record, generating over $23 billion in trading volume—a significant increase from less than $100 million recorded in 2020, according to data from DappRadar. Anyone, who is able to legally prove they created content, is entitled to sell that content as an NFT. From Youtubers to entrepreneurs, the entire artist community can now take advantage of the exciting new marketplace for their digital art. The desirability and market value of NFTs stem from their exclusivity, as their non-fungibility by definition means that NFTs are classified as one-offs. This means that, unlike other cryptocurrencies, NFTs cannot be replaced. Although one Ethereum can replace one Ethereum, nothing will replace an original Monet nor an NFT. Since NFTs exist on the blockchain, they cut out the need for any middlemen.

Gains Network is intending to build a blazing-fast and liquidity-efficient leveraged trading platform with a decentralized architecture on the Polygon blockchain, giving investors the benefit of lower fees and faster trades. gTrade currently offers 43 cryptocurrencies and 10 major Forex pairs.

Those benefits are clearly not lost on crypto investors, who have been flocking to gTrade in their droves.

42396267,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1yVU,1641402148,What’s the Healthiest Chart in Crypto? The Developer Count,"As some crypto prices show signs of flagging heading into 2022, at least one chart remains healthy: the blockchain developer count.  According to a report released today by investment firm Electric Capital, the crypto developer ecosystem has notched all-time highs in multiple metrics including monthly active developers and highest number of new developers in a calendar year.  According to Electric Partner Avichal Garg, it’s a robust sign of health and growth for the industry as a whole.  “The developer ecosystem, we’ve always thought it was the leading indicator,” Garg told CoinDesk in an interview. “The engineers are closest to whether or not there’s real value, and this many people coming in, playing with it, is a good sign. That relatively rational people who make a lot of money – their time is valuable – are spending that time here, that’s a positive long-term indicator.”  Garg noted that the developer count remains robust even in times of bearish market action, such as in late-2017 to mid-2020, but picked up steam during 2021′s crypto-asset bull run.  “Everybody who came in, they’re not all staying – there’s a bunch of developers leaving during the bear market,” he said. “But the number of new developers offsets those leaving, and then it continues to pick up in the bull.”  Chains that stand out  A key population leading the surge is developers working on top of smart contract platforms such as Ethereum and Solana. 65% of all developers working in Web 3 joined the ecosystem in 2021, and 2,500 developers are working on decentralized finance (DeFi) in particular.  While Ethereum comfortably leads all blockchains with 4,000 monthly active developers, Garg said one highlight of the report was the emergence of non-Ethereum layer 1s.  Read more: Ethereum Far Outpaces Bitcoin in Developer Activity in 2020: Electric Capital Report  Solana in particular has “broken out” with almost a 5x multiple to just under 900 monthly active developers, and the developer count is now outpacing Ethereum at the same stage of its growth cycle.  In addition to Solana, Terra is roughly tracking Ethereum’s growth pattern, Avalanche is narrowly ahead and Binance Smart Chain initially surged, but has since flagged. In total, 10 different smart contract platforms now have over 250 monthly active developers.  While the growth of alternatives has been impressive, Garg says that the effort from multiple chains to match Ethereum’s growth is actually a testament to how quickly ETH’s developer community formed.  “One of the takeaways for me is that it’s really impressive that Ethereum had this growth trajectory,” he said. “The ecosystem was so much smaller – in terms of the absolute number of developers, it’s so impressive Ethereum could do this.”  Garg added that ultimately the report highlights all the growth that has yet to come.  “To put it into context, we have 18,000 or so monthly active developers. But then you look at something like JavaScript, they have 16 million – almost 1,000x as many. When you’re talking about the sheer scale of how big a programming language can get and how successful they can be, we’re still so early.”",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | ZRX,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/05/whats-the-healthiest-chart-in-crypto-the-developer-count,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c0594ae8dd9ffd90a55ba9c6c5d9dcbdc604234-9504x6336.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin mining found a home in Kazakhstan after China’s clampdown on the industry last year. It was second only to the U.S. in energy devoted to crypto mining, according to Cambridge University, accounting for 18% of the global total as of August.  Protesters stormed public buildings on Wednesday, which was followed by the government announcing a possible dissolution of Parliament.  The country’s largest telecommunications provider, Kazakhtelecom, shut off internet access throughout the country, which will leave mining companies without the ability to mine.  “I guess some geeks would say that in theory you could mine without internet, but in practice, all the machines in Kazakhstan should be turned off because of the internet shutdown,” Jaran Mellerud, a researcher at Arcane Research, told CoinDesk.  “Also, btc.com estimates both Antpool, Poolin, F2Pool and Binance Pool to have seen significant reductions in their hashrate around the same time as the internet was shut down. These are pools widely used by Kazakh miners,” Mellerud said.  Kazakhstan’s popularity with crypto miners relied on the country’s rich oil reserves and hitherto cheap electricity.

Transfer agents facilitate securities transactions with issuers, ensuring records are accurate and supporting other tasks like issuing certificates. TTA was previously the transfer agent for INX when it raised an estimated $85 million in an initial public offering on the Ethereum blockchain. TTA in particular has been involved in supporting the INX token, which was part of the IPO, as well as Arca’s initial ArCoin launch using an Ethereum-based ERC-1404 token standard.  INX, which already has a registered broker-dealer and alternative trading system (ATS), is now one of just a handful of crypto companies that are able to issue, list and trade securities, as well as support the administrative and recordkeeping processes surrounding securities in the U.S.  “We look at security tokens as a ‘nose to tail’ business line,” INX Chief Business Officer Douglas Borthwick told CoinDesk. “With the acquisition of Tokensoft’s transfer agent, INX is now able to act as transfer agent, broker/dealer and ATS.”  Issuers would be able to raise funds, list tokens or move from one ATS to another, Borthwick said, noting that INX will be active 24/7.  “Our goal is simple, to offer issuers everything they seek under one umbrella, and then introducing these issuers to our growing INX community,” he said.  Over the past six months, INX has also acquired ILS Brokers, an over-the-counter foreign exchange trader, and Openfinance, which had the broker-dealer and ATS designations.  Tokensoft Transfer Agent launched at the end of 2019 as DTAC LLC, before being renamed in January 2021, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Tokensoft CEO Mason Borda told CoinDesk that his company’s other business units include a layer 1 support line, wrapped.com and Tokensoft Securities.  The TTA acquisition is a deepening of the two companies’ partnership, he said.  ”We think we have a structure to scale up to hundreds of more assets in 2022,” Borda said.

42411863,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgiOO,1641397805,Someone Gave You Crypto as a Gift … Now What?,"Due to the growing popularity and accessibility of digital assets, more people than ever received some form of cryptocurrency as a gift in the last year. According to a recent survey, 26% of Australians planned to give crypto as a festive gift in 2021, followed by 10% of Americans.  If you were fortunate enough to be a recipient of a cryptocurrency gift, there is a wide range of options available for you to explore before selling it.  What to do with your crypto gift  Before we dive into ways of investing or trading your shiny new cryptocurrency, it’s worth mentioning that the opportunities available to you depend on several factors. The first is the type of digital asset you received as a gift. There are over 16,000 crypto assets existing today, each with its own utilities, compatible platforms and protocols. With this in mind, you may be limited to specific exchanges or applications depending on the type of asset you have and the blockchain technology used to create them.  Nonetheless, you can explore more opportunities by simply trading the digital asset for other cryptocurrencies. Before going for this option, however, be sure to confirm that you can take out the digital asset to an external wallet or crypto exchange. If not, you will be restricted to the services provided by the app where you received the coins as a gift. Examples of apps that do not allow users to transfer cryptocurrencies to external wallets or platforms are:  Venmo  Paypal  Revolut  Robinhood  It’s worth noting Robinhood has announced plans to roll out its crypto wallet in early 2022 so customers can move their coins off-platform.  One more thing you need to have at the back of your mind is that none of the income-generating opportunities listed in this guide are risk-free. Hence, it is advisable to carry out your own research, consult a qualified financial advisor and gauge your risk appetite beforehand. That said, below is a list of what you can do with your newly acquired digital assets.  Ho ho hodl it  One of the easiest and most popular options available for new crypto holders is to simply hold on to their gifted assets long-term – usually for a minimum of one year. Although cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, the values of legitimate cryptocurrencies often maintain an upward trajectory over time as an increasing number of people adopt them. So simply by doing nothing, you can potentially generate profit by holding on to some cryptocurrency. For instance, the price of bitcoin at the beginning of 2019 was $29,000, and by November, it had risen to an all-time high of $68,700.  Now, where you do that “hodling” (the slang adopted by crypto enthusiasts for holding on tight to your coins), is a good question. The easiest solution for beginners is a custodial account like the ones offered at Coinbase, Robinhood or Paypal, but there are risks associated with this option. You’re subject to the policies of the platforms and possible security breaches.  A more secure and flexible model is to transfer or keep your coins in a non-custodial wallet. This means being responsible for your own coins, including keeping the secret key (the key used to access the wallet) safe and secure. If you lose your secret key, or forget it, you lose your coins.  Use it to buy stocks  People who received their crypto gifts on a broker app that also supports the trading of traditional stocks can use the proceeds generated from the sale of their crypto assets to invest in stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This is an ideal option for individuals who would rather stick to what they know best, which in this context is stock trading. An example of a platform where you can use crypto as capital to trade stocks is Robinhood.  Use it to pay for goods and services  Thanks to the increased adoption of cryptocurrency in recent years, it’s now possible for you to pay for goods and services using your digital assets. This feature is available to PayPal users, thanks to the launch of Checkout with Crypto functionality back in March 2021. In essence, when making payments, you can opt for a crypto payment method, and PayPal will automatically convert your coins to fiat currencies before finalizing the transaction.  Deposit crypto in interest-yielding apps  If you’re going to keep your crypto, there are a lot more options to explore than just hodling it. If your crypto assets are on apps that permit the transfer of funds to external platforms, you can take advantage of yield-bearing crypto solutions. The idea is to transfer all or a fraction of your crypto holdings into an account that would, in turn, generate fixed interests based on the duration of the investment. Think of it as putting money in a fixed deposit account. The only difference is that you are depositing digital assets instead of fiat. Below are some of the platforms that offer this service and the interest rates they provide.  Lend your crypto out  Another option you can pursue is crypto lending. With this, you lend your holdings out to borrowers and, in turn, earn interest. This can be done on custodial or non-custodial platforms, depending on your risk appetite and the level of technical expertise. In line with conventional practices, custodial lending platforms often match lenders with borrowers, set fixed interest rates and govern the entire processes involved.  The non-custodial options, which fall under a broader group of self-executing protocols known as decentralized finance (DeFi), eliminate the need to rely on intermediate services while borrowing or lending out crypto. Unlike traditional lending platforms, these solutions depend on programmable and self-executing contracts (smart contracts) to periodically set interest rates and make deposited funds accessible to borrowers.  Farm yields  Yield farming is an interest-generating strategy employed across multiple DeFi platforms. This is because it requires participants to interact with automated market makers (AMMs) or decentralized exchanges (DEX).  Here, you need to take up the role of a liquidity provider by depositing your crypto assets into purpose-built smart contracts, or what is commonly called liquidity pools. These funds are then made available to other users to trade against. For your troubles, you will receive a share of the trading fees paid by traders as well as receive liquidity provider tokens (LP tokens) that indicate your share of the liquidity deposited into the liquidity pool. In order to withdraw your initial capital out of the pool and receive your portion of transaction fees, these LP tokens must be redeemed.  Moreover, you can further leverage your stake in the platform’s total liquidity to generate even more profits by depositing the LP tokens you received into other decentralized lending protocols – effectively earning a double yield on a single set of assets. This strategy of maximizing profits using multiple DeFi protocols is what is known as yield farming.  Stake your coins  Ever since the introduction of the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which is a more power-efficient model for validating transactions executed in blockchain networks, staking has become a critical concept in the crypto space. Here, the goal is to implement a decentralized or community-focused network whereby no single entity has unfettered control over core processes, including the ones involved in validating transactions.  To this end, PoS networks delegate the role of validators to participants that have shown interest in contributing to the well-being of the network by locking a particular amount of crypto on the blockchain. With this, the protocol can seize a fraction or the entirety of validators’ stakes when they are deemed to have failed to play their part or when they try to sabotage the validity of the network (known as slashing.) In contrast, compliant validators are rewarded with rewards denominated in the network’s native token.  Although you can participate in this opportunity by staking directly on a PoS-based blockchain, the technicalities involved may restrict the profitability of such a venture. For one, you have to meet the financial, hardware and software requirements imposed on validator nodes. Also, you have to be online at all times. To bypass these requirements, you can simply opt for third-party staking services or pools. These services take up all the technicalities that come with self-staking on your behalf. Importantly, they allow users to stake a fraction of the minimum staking amount imposed by the blockchain’s protocol. As such, all you have to do is deposit your coins to start earning rewards.  Expectedly, the interest rates provided by these services are a bit lower than what you would have earned if you had staked the coins yourself. Fortunately, though, most crypto exchanges now feature flexible staking services. Hence, it is a lot easier to partake in this passive income-generating opportunity.  Finally, if you don’t want it, get the cash  Of course, there is always the option to exchange your crypto for fiat at any time, regardless of the app or platform where your cryptocurrency is stored. This is the ideal choice for individuals who are not ready to dabble into the technical, volatile and often risky world of cryptocurrency. For this option, the best line of action is to sell their cryptocurrency for fiat currency. Depending on the type of app your digital asset is located in, you can either sell the digital assets directly on the platform or transfer them to a crypto exchange where you might find better deals.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/someone-gave-you-crypto-as-a-gift-now-what,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c46a678d21cd1b7f1caa19997807b3773d1aa54-2000x1500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393995,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQdjp,1641396206,Now I Need Bitcoin: A Banking Breakdown in Mexico,"This is a story about a dumb American traveling in Mexico (me), a con man’s attempt to hustle pesos from tourists and the limitations of traditional banking.  It begins with a broken ATM.  Recently I traveled to Mexico City. I know less Spanish than the average toddler. On my very first day in Mexico, at the ATM, I inserted my card … and the machine swallowed it. I pressed the red cancel button. Nothing. I pressed more buttons at random. Nothing. I spoke to a lady inside the bank, who couldn’t understand a word I was saying (not her fault), and after we found a translator, she explained that this ATM was out of order, and that if I understood Spanish, I would have read the warning message on the screen. (Again, this is also on me. We’re in Mexico, and it’s my fault I don’t speak the language.)  I’d have to contact my bank, Fidelity, to get a new debit card mailed to me.  I would be in Mexico for the next two weeks, and clearly I’d need more cash. So I called Fidelity to cancel my card and send me a new one.  Problem 1: Fidelity says they would happily send me a new card, but I would need to call a different company, Visa Emergency Card Services, to have a new one sent. Fidelity handles my checking, but apparently they outsource things like debit cards.  So, I call Visa.  Problem 2: Visa tells me they need to authorize that I’m actually a Fidelity customer, and this could take some time. So I wait. In the meantime I can’t get cash.  I hear nothing from Visa for two days. I still have no cash aside from the pesos that a friend lent me.  Problem 3: Finally Visa tells me that I would actually need to call “PNC Bank,” because PNC Bank – another partner of Fidelity’s – is actually the group that handles the back-end of the checking. Or something.  I had never heard of PNC Bank. I’ve been a Fidelity customer for over a decade, and I have never seen the words PNC Bank on my debit card, or on my banking statements, or on my log-in screen.  Problem 4: “Hi, thank you for calling PNC bank,” the rep said. “Can I have your account number?”  “I have no idea,” I said. “I’m a Fidelity customer, and they told me to call you.”  The PNC rep checks her computer, and then tells me that no, in fact, I’m not a customer, and that I should call Fidelity.  I call back Fidelity. The Fidelity rep tells me that, nope, I never should have called PNC Bank. They say that I had been misinformed, and that I need to call Visa.  Problem 5: Again I call Visa. They tell me they’ve been trying to reach Fidelity.  In this era of cryptography, the pin can only be delivered via parcel, meaning their tech has not innovated since the days of Benjamin Franklin  “Do you know the phone number for Fidelity?” The Visa agent asked me.  “I’m the customer! Don’t you know the number?”  “One second, sir,” said Visa, who puts me on hold to find the number. Soon he comes back. “I have Fidelity on the line,” he said, so now the three of us our conferenced in.  “Can I have your account number?” The Fidelity rep asked.  I give it to her.  “Sir … can you repeat that? I’m not seeing that in my records.”  That’s bizarre. I repeat the number.  “Are you sure you’re a member of Fidelity Kansas City?” The rep asked.  “Excuse me?”  “This is the local branch of Fidelity in Kansas City. Are you a member here?”  Apparently the Visa rep had not called the primary Fidelity number – which they should know – but instead a random branch.  Problems 6, 7, 8, 9 … 37: I’ll skip ahead and summarize the flurry of calls. This kind of clumsy miscommunication – between banking partners that work together, all under the Fidelity umbrella – happened for days. I spend hours on the phone with Visa, Fidelity and PNC Bank.  By now I’ve left Mexico City, and I’m in a small beach town, Sayulita, that for the most part does not accept credit cards. Cash is king. My American friends have all returned home, I’m traveling solo, and I have no way to get cash. I’m counting on that debit card from Fidelity. Or Visa. Or PNC bank.  In the grand scheme of things, of course, this is quite literally a first-world problem. I am a privileged American who ultimately has access to resources, and I knew my pinch was temporary. Millions of people have real and wrenching problems; I only have minor headaches.  But the headache seems lifted when I finally get Visa and Fidelity on the phone together. The Fidelity rep, James, assures the Visa rep that I am in fact a customer, and that Fidelity does in fact authorize Visa to send me a debit card. James provides his employee ID number. James is making this happen. James is the best. (Most reps I spoke to were great. The failure was not one of human competence; the failure was a creaky system held together by duct tape.)  “So do you have everything I need?” I asked the Visa rep.  They assure me I do.  Problem 38: Another day passes. I get a message that I need to call back Visa, because there’s been another snag. Visa says they need more information from Fidelity to mail me the card, because they’re not sure if it should be printed as “Jeff Wilser” or “Jeffrey Wilser” or “Jeff J. Wilser” or “Jeffrey J. Wilser.” This brought everything to a halt.  Still I can’t get cash.  More calls, more waiting on hold, more connecting Fidelity and Visa. Finally they authorize the card to be sent.  Victory!  It’s guaranteed to arrive to me in Sayulita, via DHL priority mail, on Friday. For perspective, I arrived in Mexico the prior Thursday. For a week I’ve been unable to get cash.  Friday comes … no card arrives. It was held up in customs.  But hopefully DHL would deliver it on Saturday? Nope, DHL doesn’t work weekends in Mexico.  Now I’m desperate for cash. I call Visa and ask if they can do an emergency wire transfer. They said they’d be happy to, but they need to get approval from Fidelity. Now I’m feeling PTSD.  Eventually Visa gets Fidelity on the line. I’m conferenced in.  “I approve the wire transfer,’ the Fidelity rep said.  “We’re going to need your authorization code,” said Visa.  “What code?” The Fidelity rep is confused.  “We need a code to process this,” said Visa.  “One second,” said Fidelity.  Fidelity puts me on hold and tries to hunt down this “access code” that Visa needs. I feel bad for the Fidelity rep. I feel bad for the Visa rep. It’s a Saturday afternoon, and all of us would rather be doing something else. I go back to waiting on hold, and by now the hold music is the soundtrack to my life.  The Fidelity rep is back. He can’t find the needed code. He has never heard of this code. He asks around to his Fidelity colleagues and none of them knew of any such code.  Then the Visa rep realizes that it might be a moot point – to authorize a wire transfer, they’d actually need approval from another entity … PNC Bank.  I literally laugh out loud.  “PNC Bank?” I asked. “Okay. Great. Can we get PNC Bank to approve this?”  Problem 39: PNC Bank, or at least the relevant department from PNC Bank, is closed for the weekend.  The Fidelity rep says he feels bad for me, and I believe him. We’ve now been on the phone for an hour, he has heard my sad little story, and he’s as surprised as I am that we’re routed back to this enigmatic PNC Bank.  But wait! Maybe there’s a clever solution after all. I also have a credit card from Fidelity, but once again, this credit card is operated by a third party (Elan Financial Services.) My credit card is not set up to be used at ATMs; I don’t have a pin. What if Fidelity could change this, and let me use the credit card in the ATM?  “That might work,” the Fidelity rep said. “Let me look into it.”  I wait on hold. (In two weeks in Mexico, I spent more time on hold than I did on the beach.)  The good news is that, yes, my Visa credit card can be turned into a card that works at an ATM. All they need to do is give me a pin. The bad news is that they can only do this by sending the pin through the mail.  This is not a joke. They need to mail the pin. In this era of cryptography, the pin can only be delivered via parcel, meaning their tech has not innovated since the days of Benjamin Franklin.  “So there’s nothing we can do?” I asked him. “There’s no way I can get cash?”  “I’m afraid not.”  “The system broke down,” I told him.  Again he apologizes, and he essentially agrees with me. I want to underline that every individual I spoke to was competent and courteous – this isn’t their fault. (I should add that I’ve generally been a happy Fidelity customer; their customer service is normally top-notch. And I contacted Fidelity a few weeks later to ask if they would like to comment for this story; outside of an email apology that looked a bit like a form letter, they declined.)  Now here’s where bitcoin enters the story.  Kidding. I don’t know that cryptocurrency – at least with today’s infrastructure – would have cracked my problem. Taco stands in Sayulita do not accept bitcoin or shiba. And this is not El Salvador. Perhaps I could have used something like LocalBitcoins to swap bitcoin (I own some) for pesos. Maybe that could have worked.  But I do know that when people in the U.S. say, “crypto makes no sense, because my credit card works just fine,” that’s only part of the story. Yes, it works “just fine” when everything runs smoothly. It works “just fine” if you don’t mind paying the fees, whether directly or indirectly. It works “just fine” when no other countries are involved. But when that bubble is pierced? The banks can’t even talk to themselves.  Now this is where the con man enters the story.  I’m down to my final 50 pesos. That’s the equivalent of about $2.50.  Thanks to this mini-breakdown of the banking system, I’ve turned into a pathetic peso-hustler  I have one last move to make.  I head to a gringo tourist bar, and I order a beer with my last 50 pesos. (Luckily, beers are cheap.)  It’s a Saturday afternoon. College football is playing. I spot a tipsy American woman who’s cheering for Oklahoma. So now I’m cheering for Oklahoma. I went to college at The University of Texas; Oklahoma is our sworn enemy.  “Go Oklahoma!” I yelled.  Soon the lady and I are chatting. We’re flirting. And now I feel like a con man. “So, I have a crazy question,” I said, smiling, “but I’m wondering if you can help me…”  I tell her my plight, or at least a highly condensed version, and I ask her if I can Venmo her U.S. dollars in exchange for pesos. She agrees. Soon I have a stack of 1,000 pesos, I feel flush with cash, and later I repeat the same trick with another tipsy American tourist. Thanks to this mini-breakdown of the banking system, I’ve turned into a pathetic peso-hustler.  More flirting, more hustling, more pesos. Soon I can buy all the tacos and beers I want.

42375563,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw99cp,1641394842,Fireblocks ‘Whitelists’ 30 Trading Firms for Aave’s Institutional DeFi Debut,"In a zero-interest environment in traditional markets, banks may have a new friend in decentralized finance (DeFi) – or a version of which they can at least compliantly participate in.  This is what institution-friendly DeFi initiative Aave Arc is offering, having now officially launched with the help of cryptocurrency custody firm Fireblocks, plus a “whitelist” of 30 licensed trading firms.  The lending and borrowing of cryptocurrency that happens in DeFi is normally done in a purely pseudonymous manner; users are known by nothing more than long strings of numbers and letters. This stands in stark contrast to the way traditional finance operates, where counterparties to a trade are clearly identified by a know-your-customer (KYC) process.  As such, today’s DeFi market, which boasts over $250 billion in total locked value, has largely remained untapped by institutions because of the aforementioned KYC and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. Enabling institutional access to DeFi could unlock a trillion-dollar opportunity over the next half decade, according to some estimates.  The 30 licensed financial institutions approved by multi-party computation (MPC) specialist Fireblocks include Anubi Digital, Bluefire Capital (acquired by Galaxy Digital), Canvas Digital, Celsius, CoinShares, GSR, Hidden Road, Ribbit Capital, Covario and Wintermute.  Parallel universe  The creation of permissioned DeFi pools with regulated entities in mind was proposed back in September of last year. However, Aave Arc started out as “more of an experiment that became an actual new protocol,” according to Aave CEO Stani Kulechov.  Looking ahead, Kulechov predicts permissioned and unpermissioned DeFi will likely exist in parallel.  “We might even see permissioned markets like trading facilities in DeFi, that are just private because they want to concentrate liquidity, or have some other benefits,” said Kulechov in an interview, adding that there’s been “enormous” interest in Aave Arc from institutions, including banks.  “What’s fascinating about those financial institutions is how diverse they are,” Kulechov said. “There are financial institutions that are participating in crypto, there are financial institutions such as hedge funds who are just looking to park their cash reserves into the Aave Arc market to earn yield.”  Permissioned pools  As it stands, Fireblocks has around 250 clients who are using DeFi the way you’d expect (permissionless pools), done via the custody tech firm’s wallet connect or browser extension. As far as Aave Arc goes, any information about whitelisted institutions trading in permissioned DeFi pools is only known to Fireblocks, and remains unknown to Aave and other firms, Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov pointed out.  “This is not very different from the situation today because they’re using our wallet, so that information is known to us,” Shaulov said in an interview. “But besides that they are anonymous. The only thing being provided is the fact that they all passed through KYC.”  Using the machinery Aave developed, there was an obvious opportunity to create whitelisted pools, where institutions have all gone through AML screening, thus making DeFi palatable for regulated entities, Shaulov said.  “If you’re using a permissionless pool, and you are from the U.S., how can you prove that the person that you’re trading with on the other side of the pool is not, for instance, an Iranian entity?” said Shaulov in an interview.  DeFi forever  The idea that permissioned pools go against the whole principle of DeFi is a question that Shaulov and Kulechov get asked from time to time.  “The simple answer is that it does,” Shaulov said. “But it’s a necessary step, or an overcorrection, for the industry to get to a different state over an 18- to 24-month horizon. Coming next will be a kind of soft KYC, where you have a KYC token, or on-chain KYC. But in order to get there, we need to take a slightly more aggressive approach.”  Aave’s Kulechov likened Web 3 and DeFi to the oceans of the world. Infrastructure software is like those international waters that are not owned by anyone specifically and anyone can travel through, he said. But once you go to a port, then you step into regulation, and financial institutions are the ports for that ocean, he added.  “I think DeFi will be forever permissionless and accessible to everyone as long as these networks – public blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche – are decentralized,” Kulechov said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/05/fireblocks-whitelists-30-trading-firms-for-aaves-institutional-defi-debut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9308f599f966cfafa038bfd44fbfb182006b6aba-1441x940.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Nasdaq-listed Hut 8 follows a “hodl” strategy, meaning it keeps all of the bitcoin it mines in its custody, essentially betting that their value will increase in the long term. The reserves represent a 97% increase compared to the end of 2020, the press release said.  Hut 8′s rate of bitcoin production was up slightly from an average of 8.83 BTC mined per day in November 2021 to 8.9 mined per day in December, according to the statement.  Hut 8′s total installed operating capacity stood at 2 exahash/second (EH/s) at the end of 2021, up 125% year-over-year, the company said. This represents 1.16% of the bitcoin network’s total hashrate, a measure of computing power on the network, as of Wednesday, according to data from CoinWarz.  Hut 8 plans to increase its installed capacity to 3.35 EH/s by the end of Q1 2022, across its three sites in Canada. To do this, the miner added new machines to two existing sites in December, and is building out a third mining farm.  In December, Hut 8 added 228 petahash/second (PH/s) of hashrate by buying 2,505 MicroBT M30S mining rigs from Foundry Digital, the statement said. These machines were already installed in Hut 8’s site in Medicine Hat, Alberta. Crypto mining and staking firm Foundry is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which is also CoinDesk’s parent company.  Hut 8 is updating the electricity infrastructure at its Medicine Hat mining farm so that it can optimize the hashrate as new MicroBT mining machines are delivered, it said. These upgrades are “on track” to add another 450 PH/s of computing power in February 2022, the company said.  Also in December, Hut 8 installed 2,782 new MicroBT M30S and M31S+ machines in its site in Drumheller, Alberta, according to the press release.  Hut 8′s third mining site in North Bay, Ontario, is set to be fully operational by the end of Q1, the press release said. At full capacity, this site will add another 850 PH/s of hashrate at 35 megawatts.  On Dec. 30, 2021, the Canadian miner agreed to take on a $30 million equipment financing loan at 9.5% interest rate from Trinity Capital. The loan, repayable over a three-year term, is collateralized by “certain new MicroBT machines being installed” at Hut 8′s Medicine Hut and North Bay sites, according to the press release.

42375575,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw99rv,1641391195,Shares of Crypto Miner Riot Blockchain Jump 7% After Cantor Starts Coverage,"Shares of crypto mining firm Riot Blockchain (RIOT) surged on Tuesday, closing over 7% higher, after broker Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage with an “overweight” rating and a price target of $45. However, shares tumbled 12% on Wednesday as the price of bitcoin fell several percent.  Cantor sees Riot as one of the best ways for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without having to own the digital asset directly, as the mining company holds most of the mined coins on its balance sheet.  The broker said that Riot is in an “unique position” to continue to win market share in the coming years. The miner plans to more than double its mining capacity to 750 MW by the second quarter of 2022, and to triple its hashrate to 9 EH/s by year end, Cantor noted in its report.  The miner’s hashrate is the second highest in the industry, the report added.  Riot’s acquisition of Whinstone gives it a significant advantage over its peers because it reduces the miner’s reliance on third party hosting providers, Cantor said. The acquisition also makes it more vertically integrated and gives the firm increased control over its mining infrastructure and operating costs, the broker added.  The Nasdaq-listed mining company acquired Whinstone from Northern Data AG in April for a total value of $651 million in cash and shares.  On Wednesday, Riot announced that it had mined 425 bitcoins in December, up 334% from 98 bitcoins a year ago, and 3,812 bitcoins in all of 2021, up 269% from 1,033 in 2021. At the end of 2021, Riot owned 4,889 bitcoins, worth roughly $213 million at current prices.  That compared to 1,044 bitcoin mined in December and 5,769 mined in 2021 by Core Scientific, 363 bitcoins mined in December and 3,452 in 2021 by Bitfarms (BITF) and 484.5 bitcoins mined in December and 3,197 in 2021 by Marathon Digital (MARA).

42411871,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgioq,1641389267,"How to Make, Buy and Sell NFTs","Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique collectible crypto assets that have been around as early as 2012 when the concept of Bitcoin Colored Coins first emerged. These coins were simply satoshis – small fractions of a bitcoin – marked, or “colored in,” with distinct information that could link the coins to real-world assets. An example of this could be “this satoshi represents $500 worth of John Doe’s New York office building.” For the most part, however, Colored Coins were used to create and trade artwork like “Rare Pepe” digital cards on Counterparty, a peer-to-peer trading platform built on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain.  These cartoon frog images adapted from a viral internet meme were some of the earliest examples of unique digital artwork tied to crypto tokens. This paved the way for the ideation and creation of new non-fungible token standards – a set of blockchain building blocks that allow developers to create their own NFTs.  Lee este artículo en español.  NFTs can be used to represent virtually any type of real or intangible item, including:  Artwork  Virtual items within video games such as skins, virtual currency, weapons and avatars  Music  Collectibles (e.g. digital trading cards)  Tokenized real-world assets, from real estate and cars to racehorses and designer sneakers  Virtual land  Video footage of iconic sporting moments  How to make an NFT  Making your own NFT, whether it be a GIF or an image, is a relatively straightforward process and doesn’t require extensive knowledge of the crypto industry. NFT artwork can also be used to create collectibles like sets of digital trading cards.  Flow by Dapper Labs  Tron  EOS  Polkadot  Tezos  Cosmos  WAX  Each blockchain has its own separate NFT token standard, compatible wallet services and marketplaces. For instance, if you make NFTs on top of the Binance Smart Chain, you will only be able to sell them on platforms that support Binance Smart Chain assets. This means you wouldn’t be able to sell them on something like VIV3 – a Flow blockchain-based marketplace – or OpenSea which is an Ethereum-based NFT marketplace.  Since Ethereum has the largest NFT ecosystem, here’s what you’ll need to make your own NFT artwork, music or video on the Ethereum blockchain:  An Ethereum wallet that supports ERC-721 (the Ethereum-based NFT token standard), such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet or Coinbase Wallet.  Enough ether (ETH) to pay the gas fees. If you are using a Coinbase wallet you can buy ether from the platform with U.S. dollars, British pound sterling and other fiat currencies. Otherwise, you will need to purchase ether from a cryptocurrency exchange.  Once you have these, there are a number of NFT-centric platforms that allow you to connect your wallet and upload your chosen image or file that you want to turn into an NFT.  The main Ethereum NFT marketplaces include:  OpenSea  Rarible  Mintable  Makersplace also allows you to make your own NFTs but you have to register to become a listed artist on the platform beforehand.  OpenSea, Rarible and Mintable all have a “create” button in the top right corner.  Here’s how the process works on OpenSea, currently the largest Ethereum-based NFT marketplace.  Clicking the ""create"" button (blue) will take you to a screen that asks you to connect your Ethereum-based wallet. Once you’ve entered your wallet password when requested it will automatically connect your wallet with the marketplace. You may have to digitally sign a message in your Ethereum wallet to prove you own the wallet address, but it’s just a case of clicking through to proceed.  Digitally signing a message does not incur a fee, it’s just to show that you have ownership over the wallet.  The next step on OpenSea is to hover over “create” in the top right corner and select “my collections.” From there, click the blue “create” button as shown below.  A window will appear that allows you to upload your artwork, add a name and include a description.  This part is essentially just you creating a folder for your newly created NFTs to go in.  Once you’ve assigned an image for your collection, it will appear as shown below (blue). You’ll then need to add a banner image to the page by clicking on the pencil icon in the top right corner (red).  Your page should end up looking something like the image below.  Now, you’re ready to make your first NFT. Click on the “Add New Item” button (blue) and sign another message using your wallet.  You’ll arrive at a new window where you can upload your NFT image, audio, GIF or 3D model.  On OpenSea and many other marketplaces, you also have the option to include special traits and attributes to increase the scarcity and uniqueness of your NFT. Creators even have the opportunity to include unlockable content that can only be viewed by the purchaser. This can be anything from passwords to access certain services to discount codes and contact information.  Once you’re finished, click “create” at the bottom and sign another message in your wallet to confirm the creation of the NFT. The artwork should then appear in your collection.  How much does it cost to make NFTs?  While it costs nothing to make NFTs on OpenSea, some platforms charge a fee. With Ethereum-based platforms, this fee is known as “gas.” Ethereum gas is simply an amount of ether required to perform a certain function on the blockchain – in this instance, it would be adding a new NFT to the marketplace. The cost of gas varies depending on network congestion. The higher the number of people transacting value over the network at a given time, the higher the price of gas fees and vice versa.  Top tip: Ethereum gas fees are significantly cheaper on average during the weekend when fewer people are transacting value over the network. This can help keep costs down if you’re listing multiple NFTs for sale.  Read More: What Are Gas Fees?  How to buy NFTs  Before you rush to buy NFTs, there are four things you need to consider first:  What marketplace do you intend to buy the NFTs from?  What wallet do you need to download in order to connect with the platform and purchase NFTs?  Which cryptocurrency do you need to fund the wallet with in order to complete the sale?  Are the NFTs you want to buy being sold at a specific time, i.e. via a pack or art drop?  As you can probably guess by now, certain NFTs are only available on specific platforms. For example, if you want to purchase NBA Top Shot packs you will need to open an account with NBA Top Shot, create a Dapper wallet and fund it with either the USDC stablecoin or supported fiat currency options. You will also have to wait for one of the card pack drops to be announced and try your luck in trying to buy them before they sell out.  Pack and art drops are becoming increasingly common as a method for selling scarce NFTs to an audience of hungry buyers. These drops normally require users to sign up and fund their accounts beforehand so that they don’t miss out on the opportunity to purchase NFTs when they drop. Pack and art drops can be over in seconds, so you need to have everything ready ahead of time.  How to sell NFTs  To sell your NFTs on a marketplace, you’ll need to locate them in your collection, click on them and find the “sell” button. Clicking this will take you to a pricing page where you can define the conditions of the sale including whether to run an auction or sell at a fixed price.  Ether and other ERC-20 tokens are the most common cryptocurrencies you can sell your NFTs for, however, some platforms only support the native token of the blockchain they were built upon. VIV3, for example, is a Flow blockchain marketplace and only accepts FLOW tokens.  By clicking on the “edit” button next to the collection image on OpenSea, signing the message using your wallet and scrolling down, you have the option to program in royalties and select which ERC-20 token you’d like to receive for selling the NFT. Royalties allow NFT creators to earn a commission every time the asset is sold to a new person. This has the potential to create lifelong passive income streams for artists and other content creators automatically thanks to smart contracts.  Listing NFTs on a marketplace sometimes requires a fee in order to complete the process. While it’s not the case with every platform, it’s something to be mindful of when creating NFTs.  Where to buy NFTs  For crypto traders who are primarily interested in buying NFTs, here is a list of the most popular NFT marketplaces in 2021:  OpenSea  Rarible  SuperRare  Nifty Gateway  Foundation  Axie Marketplace  BakerySwap  NFT ShowRoom  VIV3  Is now a good time to buy and sell NFTs?  The NFT craze is far from being over. Major brands and celebrities such as the UFC and Shawn Mendez have released or signed deals to release their own non-fungible assets, and even Elon Musk’s girlfriend Grimes has jumped on the bandwagon selling almost $6 million worth of digital artwork in minutes.  Interest in NFTs continues to remain strong, with NFT sales during the first 5 days of 2022 breaking $700 million on OpenSea – driven largely by the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) collections. With more blockchains competing to produce better NFT services too and a growing range of platforms to choose from, now is a great time to take part in the space.

Put together, NFTs are unique records of ownership that are stored in a blockchain. Since NFTs represent ownership, their potential applications are only limited by the human imagination. NFTs are already being used to sell music, heroes in blockchain games, and digital land from metaverse projects, e.g. The Sandbox. Additionally, recent developments in blockchain technology have enabled investors to purchase physical assets with NFTs. This is made possible by tokenization, the process by which physical asset ownership is encoded into a blockchain. This has many implications for the investments world, the most impactful of which is tokenized real estate. Pioneering Metaverse Real Estate NFTs are powered by smart contracts, bits of software that enforce digital agreements. Smart contracts make ownership management through NFTs extremely efficient by handling royalties, payment distributions, and the transfer of legal ownership rights.

Drone Racing League (DRL) and Web 3 game developer Playground Labs have tapped Algorand’s blockchain to create the first play-to-earn drone game in the metaverse, announced by the league on Wednesday.  The details for the game itself have yet to be determined – a representative from DRL told CoinDesk it will look to its community to determine what style of gaming they’d most enjoy. Play-to-earn, or GameFi, refers to an emerging subsector of the crypto world where gamers are rewarded with digital assets that carry value beyond the confines of a particular title, as is often the case in mainstream gaming.  While the details are still to be worked out, the league said “players will race DRL drones” (presumably digital ones) for cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Algorand.  DRL’s involvement in blockchain is on par with its already hybrid and experimental slate of competition, which includes real-life races with physical drones as well as virtual esports matches. The GameFi tie-up follows a reported five-year, $100 million deal with Algorand that was announced last September.  Drone betting  The league has also introduced sports betting to the platform in an effort to stay ahead of the times, being “the first sport in the air” that fans can bet on, according to a press release.  “We’re building a roadmap of so many different things in the next several years,” DRL President Rachel Jacobson told CoinDesk in an interview. “We have to know blockchain because we always want to be 10 steps ahead and first to market. We’re going to be Playground Labs’ crown jewel.”  DRL has also tapped Algorand as the title sponsor for its world championship event held at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, which will include a performance from American rock staple Weezer, among other festivities.

42410942,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtT5I,1641385800,The State of Ethereum’s Fee Market,"While looking back on August’s London hard fork, it is easy to focus on the millions of ether burnt via transaction fees. While important, just looking at the burn mechanism would be shortsighted and overly focused on “number go up.”  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  So what was the motivation for EIP 1559 and, after four months, what real impacts have we seen? Below are four of the core issues that the improvement proposal aimed to address:  Mismatch between volatility of transaction fee levels and social cost of transactions  A report from Coinbase highlights the upgrade’s effects seen during operation, in which the exchange noted it is currently saving 27 ETH per day from base-fee refunds. When contrasting legacy style transactions with post-EIP 1559 style transactions, Coinbase saves 9% per transaction using the new format.  Needless delays for users  Another noticeable improvement post-EIP 1559 was the broadcast-to-confirmation time that Coinbase recorded on transactions. While saving on gas, Coinbase also saw transactions confirmed an average of 11 seconds faster than before the London hard fork. Blocktime on Ethereum typically takes 13 seconds, so the upgrade speeds confirmation up by 0.7 blocks.  Inefficiencies of first price auctions  On the opposing side, Galaxy Digital’s look into EIP 1559 reported issues due to increased block size (gas limits) and the gaming of an algorithmically adjusting base fee. While Ethereum developers increased the gas limit with the hope that blocks would find an equilibrium around 15 million gas, the reality has been a majority of completely full blocks nearing 30 million gas. Higher gas limits and full blocks strains mining and node hardware and can have negative impacts on the decentralization of a network.  Finally, tech savvy users and bots have been able to look at the mempool, where all pending Ethereum transactions are waiting to process, and see whether the base fee will adjust up or down in the next block. With this information, bots are able to send transactions within the cheaper block and essentially game the algorithm.  Instability of blockchains with no block reward  The burn mechanism built into EIP 1559 helps solve a long-term validation problem inherent to blockchains. Block rewards into perpetuity help incentivize miners and validators to bring security to the network, but the associated inflation is detrimental to the network’s native token. In order to solve this dilemma, EIP 1559 burns transaction fees to counteract block reward inflation.

BACKGROUND: Many have pointed at Sushi to highlight the downsides of governance protocols running competitive businesses, yet the community is pushing to keep the project alive. Arca, Dialectic and Daniele Sesta pieced together a governance proposal that would give Sushi a more formal corporate structure moving forward.  NFT monthly trading volume regains uptrend after falling consecutively since August. BACKGROUND: OpenSea’s 362,000 active users traded $3.2 billion in volume during December, the second most in any month ever. With new active users piling in throughout 2021 and the Bored Ape Yacht Club generating attention from celebrities, the market could see further mania in the NFT space.  Vitalik Buterin tweeted a roadmap for the Beacon Chain, showing scalability improvements are the next target. BACKGROUND: The upcoming transition to proof-of-stake creates a foundation for Ethereum to scale and onboard a new generation of users. Vitalik’s roadmap showed the first upgrades post-Merge will be calldata expansion and basic sharding, both of which drive costs down for rollups or layer 2s.  Layer 2 protocols are spending an increasing amount of gas to settle transactions on mainnet. BACKGROUND: Most rollups will batch users’ transactions and post the larger batch to mainnet via calldata. The increase in gas spending by rollup solutions signals adoption of Ethereum- focused scaling solutions, which the Ethereum team plans on being the main source of scalability in coming years.

The funding comes five months after Livepeer’s initial Series B round, which also raised $20 million and was led by Digital Currency Group, which is the parent company of CoinDesk.  Howard co-founded Brevan Howard Asset Management, a European hedge fund focused on macro trading, but stepped down from his CEO role in 2019 to focus on his personal investing. He has a net worth of $2.8 billion, according to Forbes.  The new funding will go toward expanding the go-to-market and customer base using the MistServer video software that Livepeer acquired last fall, Livepeer founder and CEO Doug Petkanics said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Read more: Decentralized Video Protocol Livepeer Raises $20M to Take On Streaming Giants  MistServer is a flexible content delivery technology that helps developers build on a cost-effective infrastructure and scale streaming applications across a wide variety of verticals, including entertainment, events and gaming.  Livepeer’s near-term roadmap includes plans for artificial intelligence-backed smart video and peer-to-peer content delivery, as well as AI-enhanced content moderation, song detection and video fingerprinting.  Livepeer plans to make MistServer widely available to video developers in an open source model rather than the license model typically used in the video industry.  The company’s future plans also include migrating more of its protocol to a layer two solution that would be less expensive for node operators and token holders.  “I think this is going to be the year that Web 3 applications touch millions of consumers. I’m excited for Livepeer to be the video layer that powers a lot of that,” said Petkanics.

The situation has been a messy case study of applying Web 2 copyright laws to Web 3 products, with NFT sales falling into a gray area of the film’s distribution rights. Tarantino, the film’s director, only owns the screenplay.  Much of the confusion can also be attributed to the “secret” nature of the NFTs themselves – only the holders of the NFTs can view their content, a technology implemented by SCRT Labs’ Cosmos-based Secret Network.  Read more: Director Quentin Tarantino Sued by Miramax Over ‘Pulp Fiction’ NFTs  The “Pulp Fiction” project has since tightened the language used to describe the content of the NFTs, explaining that the scenes are not actually video clips left out of the film’s final cut but images of the screenplay’s handwritten text accompanied by Tarantino’s voiceover.  “There’s been no attempt to dismiss any of Miramax’s claims by Tarantino’s team, nor have they filed any counter claims or motions against Miramax,” Proskauer Rose LLP Partner Bart Williams, part of the studio’s legal team, told CoinDesk in an email.  A Miramax spokesperson said Tarantino filed an answer to the studio’s complaint last month and an initial scheduling conference in court is slated for Feb. 24.  Despite the legal proceedings, Tarantino and his collaborators at Secret Network say the NFTs will be released in seven “chapters” starting on Jan. 17 and ending Jan. 31. Each chapter is said to contain a different bonus scene NFT.  “The secret nature of the tech made things more complicated, absolutely,” Guy Zyskind, CEO of SCRT Labs, told CoinDesk in an interview. “But Quentin has the rights, and we’ve known he’s had the rights the whole time, so we are excited to move forward with him with support.”  Read more: Secret Network Raises $11.5M to Further Privacy and App Development",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/05/quentin-tarantino-to-release-pulp-fiction-nfts-flouting-miramax-lawsuit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9bb562e841365abe095efd33ae3e0a7b85c05f27-2796x1863.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

LINK traded at $26.04 during the European morning hours, extending a 27% rise in the past week. It hit a resistance level and fell back as some traders took profits. Price charts show the $26-$28 range could prove to be trading limits. If it breaks through, another major resistance exists at $30.  LINK is used to pay for price feeds and other services on Chainlink and has a market capitalization of $12 billion, CoinGecko data show. The price is, however, down 50% from May 2021′s record $52.  Oracles are blockchain-based services that fetch data from outside a blockchain. Blockchains, by design, are immutable stores of data, but can’t verify if the entered data is false or rogue. This is where oracle networks like Chainlink help – they refer multiple sources of information to provide reliable data to blockchain-based services and products for users.  LINK was one of the few tokens in green as the rest of the market showed tepid growth.  Bitcoin steady while some altcoins surge  Bitcoin gained over $460 in the past 24 hours ahead of Wednesday’s release of the minutes of the December meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed). Investors expect early rate hikes as the agency ends its asset-buying program in March 2022.  The program was started by the Fed after the first coronavirus outbreak in early 2020 to support asset prices, leading to inflation concerns and increased interest in risky assets such as bitcoin. The Fed’s balance sheet has since grown to $8.75 trillion.  A steady bitcoin saw several major cryptocurrencies hold support levels. Ether (ETH), binance coin (BNB), and solana (SOL) – three of the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap – rose just over 1% in the past 24 hours.  Losers among major cryptocurrencies showed only slight declines. Tokens of Terra (LUNA) and Avalanche (AVAX), which have risen as much as 30% in the past month, lost just over 1% of their value in the past 24 hours.  Top gainers outside of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap included fantom (FTM) and osmosis (OSMO), which continued their rise from the start of this week. Both tokens have seen increased interest as investors search for blockchain ecosystems – outside of Ethereum – that can support the creation of software and other services atop their networks.",POSITIVE,LINK,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/05/chainlink-jumps-while-bitcoin-stages-recovery,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7f4dae5be1e546241f1060ca6d9b1d97730d880-1813x830.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42375577,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw99vh,1641381497,Bitcoin May Squeeze Higher as Retail Interest Subsides: Analysts,"Bitcoin, the crypto market leader, could be in for a recovery rally, as retail interest declines, analysts told CoinDesk.  “Whilst bitcoin remains flat in the short term, on-chain metrics like the paper hands ratio from Glassnode suggest a bottom could be nearing,” Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, told CoinDesk in an email.  The BTC paper hands ratio is the ratio of young coins active in the last six months to the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply. A high reading represents greed among retail or short-term traders, while a low number signals retail disinterest.  Retail investors are often referred to as having paper hands – weak capacity or desire to hold an asset for a long time – and are usually the last to enter the bull run and exit the bear run. Hence, declining retail activity is considered a contrary indicator – a hint of an impending reversal higher.  “If this ratio gives a high reading, it suggests retail greed, but if it is low, it suggests the market is at retail capitulation,” Sotiriou said. “We are at 24.5% currently, the lowest level since the 2015 bear market. Every time the ratio has reached around 25% previously, it has sparked a multiyear bull market with incredible gains, which indicates that this fearful period could be a great buying opportunity based on historical data.”  Further, the prevalent cautious mood in the derivatives market may portend a move higher. “The neutral to slightly below neutral funding rates seen recently suggest that a short squeeze is a plausible scenario,” according to Arcane Research’s weekly note published on Tuesday.  Funding rates refer to the cost of holding long or short positions in the futures perpetuals market. The mechanism helps keep the price of perpetuals or futures with no expiry tethered to the spot price. Positive funding rates mean longs are paying shorts, while negative rates mean the opposite.  Since early December, the number of open positions on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume and open interest, has increased from 190,000 BTC to 258,000 BTC. Meanwhile, funding rates have been consistently neutral to negative, meaning investors have been predominantly holding shorts despite bitcoin’s downside momentum running out of steam and the cryptocurrency consolidating in the range of $45,400-$52,100.  A cautious or bearish mood after notable sell-off and consolidation often leads to short squeeze and corrective rallies. Costs associated with holding shorts become an issue for the bears once the market stops falling, thus forcing them to unwind their bearish bets. However, a squeeze higher may remain elusive if the macro picture turns bleak, as discussed here.  Bitcoin was last seen trading near $46,750, representing a 2% gain on the day.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/05/bitcoin-may-squeeze-higher-as-retail-interest-subsides-analyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4cea7c856db0381194cf63e0a5b370cd06b7c75-1400x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375564,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw99e5,1641376028,UK’s Advertising Regulator Bans 2 Crypto.com Ads,"Cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com has had two ads banned because they were considered to be misleading by the U.K’s advertising regulator, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).  The first ad was shown Sept. 1 on the Daily Mail newspaper’s app. It included text saying, “Buy Bitcoin with credit card instantly,” the regulator said Wednesday.  The ASA determined that the company was encouraging customers to purchase crypto with a credit card, which would possibly be subject to a higher cash interest rate as well as other fees.  The second ad, shown July 30 in the Love Balls cellphone game published by Lion Studios, said, “Earn up to 3.5% p.a,” while the number cited in the text increased to “8.5%.” This was thought to be misleading because consumers would assume their investment would grow by the higher amount shown, when the return would depend on the type of crypto invested and the length of term, the ASA said.  The ASA also said the ads were irresponsible, taking advantage of consumers’ “inexperience or credulity” and failed to make clear that crypto investments aren’t regulated in the U.K.  The exchange joins a troupe of crypto platforms to have their knuckles rapped by the ASA. Last month, Coinbase, eToro and Luno were all criticized for potentially taking advantage of consumers’ inexperience and not clearly illustrating the risk involved in their products and services.  Crypto.com told the ASA that the ads had been removed when it first heard of the concerns and it was drafting a new U.K. marketing policy. In the first case, the ad wasn’t an encouragement to buy crypto, but drew attention to the ease with which transactions could be carried out on its platform. The second targeted existing crypto holders with a way of generating yield. They would already be aware of the investment risks, it said.  “We appreciate the collaborative dialogue and engagement from the ASA regarding advertising in the U.K. in this relatively new industry, and remain committed to working with them and regulators around the world to ensure all of our activities are compliant with the most recent regulatory guidelines,” a Crypto.com spokesperson told CoinDesk.  It was reported yesterday that some Members of Parliament are asking the government to consider a regulatory clampdown on digital investment platforms given that no agency is directly responsible for the regulation of crypto assets, with the ASA being the only such body to take a proactive stance.

42375579,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw99wx,1641371796,"Bitcoin Holds Support Ahead of Fed Minutes, March Rate Hike Probability Rises","Bitcoin held critical support even as traditional risk assets dipped amid greater prospects of an early rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed).  The top cryptocurrency by market cap rose 1% to $46,300, ensuring a continued squeeze in a four-week trading range of $45,400-$52,100. On Tuesday, the lower end of the trading range came into play, but sellers failed to push through the long-held support.  Asian stocks dipped along with the S&P 500 futures and tech-heavy Nasdaq futures. Gold posted marginal gains while copper and other growth-sensitive industrial metals faced losses. The anti-risk currencies like the U.S. dollar, Swiss franc and Japanese yen traded flat to positive, according to Investing.com.  According to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, investors were pricing a 61% probability of a 25 basis point rate hike in March. That’s a significant increase from the 25.9% probability a month ago. While last month the central bank signaled three rate hikes for 2022 and an end of liquidity-boosting asset purchase program in March, it assured markets of a gradual pace of policy tightening.  However, a continued rise in the March rate hike probability might mean faster tightening - four rate hikes, each delivered at quarterly meetings.  “If the Fed goes to 4 hikes next year, that is a big statement. That means either two things. First, they are hiking in March, which would be no gap between the end of QE (quantitative easing) and the first hike. Not impossible, but that is a big statement about intent,” John Turek, the author of the Cheap Convexity blog, said in a blog post published on Dec. 29. “If they don’t go in March and want to go 4 times next year, that means they will be hiking at a rate faster than quarterly, which is not something they have done in over a decade.”  Bitcoin and asset prices, in general, may come under pressure if the Fed’s December meeting minutes, due at 19:00 UTC on Wednesday, reveal an internal debate on raising rates and starting the balance sheet contraction along with the end of asset purchases in March. That might bolster the probability of a Fed rate hike in two months and perhaps force markets to consider the possibility of four rate rises this year.  “Balance-sheet reduction could be started concurrently with the first rate hike,” Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citigroup, said in a report, according to Bloomberg. “If the first hike occurred in March, it is possible that the committee would simply continue to taper purchases resulting in a reduction in the size of the balance sheet concurrent with the first rate hike.”  The Fed’s balance sheet has more than doubled to $8.75 trillion since the start of the coronavirus crisis in March 2020, leading to asset price inflation. The balance sheet expansion is set to end with the termination of the asset purchase program in March.  While bitcoin is widely touted as a safe haven by the crypto community, it is also an emerging technology and sensitive to monetary policy tightening.  The focus would also be on policymakers’ view of employment and inflation ahead of Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show the economy added 424,000 jobs and the unemployment rate slipped to 4.1% in December.  Bitcoin could pick up a bid if the minutes show that most policymakers were against the idea of controlling inflation at the expense of the labor market strength, implying slower rate hikes. (Policy tightening can bring down inflation, but it hurts businesses.)  Last month, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank needed to shift its focus from maximum employment to preventing inflation from becoming entrenched. So while the minutes and Friday’s payrolls report may inject some volatility into the crypto market, a clear directional bias may emerge next week after the release of the U.S. inflation data.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/05/bitcoin-holds-support-ahead-of-fed-minutes-march-rate-hike-probability-rises,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac2be5c4f57133fd311fa550d2a1b53f5b9cada1-2476x1374.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Goldman estimates that the public holds about $2.6 trillion of gold for investment purposes, assuming a gold price of $1,800 per troy ounce.

OpenSea said Tuesday night that investors valued the company at $13.3 billion in the Series C funding round, up sharply from the startup’s $1.5 billion valuation in a $100 million Series B round announced last July. The New York Times was first to report the news.  Tuesday’s big numbers show how rapidly OpenSea has ensconced itself as the leading venue for trading non-fungible tokens. The firm said in a blog post it plans to use the funding for product development, hiring and startup investments and to “significantly improve customer support and customer safety.”  Despite some high-profile user blunders, business has been brisk for OpenSea. In the last 30 days alone, the marketplace for prized profile pics and other digital collectibles logged 1.6 million transactions on the Ethereum blockchain and a trading volume of $2.4 billion, according to data compiled by DappRadar.  The company was founded by Devin Finzer and Alex Atallah in 2017, well before NFTs had captured mainstream interest. CoinDesk’s first piece on OpenSea – for a $2 million funding round led by crypto venture capital firm 1confirmation – called it “an eBay for CryptoKitties.”  “Devin and Alex have shown true grit over the last four years, weathering uncertainty and sticking to their vision of NFTs as an internet- and world-changing primitive,” Paradigm Managing Partner Fred Ehrsam told CoinDesk via email.  OpenSea’s latest round is another sign of the boom times in crypto venture capital, with over $30 billion in investments flowing into crypto startups in 2021.  Bigger valuations have been had in recent months. For comparison, FTX’s funding round in October valued the crypto exchange at a whopping $25 billion.  However, OpenSea may be the king of the NFTs. Dapper Labs, the firm behind NBA Top Shot and the Flow blockchain, nabbed a $7.6 billion valuation in September in another round led by Coatue.  A request for comment sent to OpenSea wasn’t returned by press time.  Katie Haun, until recently a partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), participated in the OpenSea round through her new firm, KRH, a spokesperson said via email. That confirms an earlier report Tuesday from tech reporter Eric Newcomer that the funding round with Haun’s involvement was in the works.  Haun led both OpenSea’s Series A and Series B funding rounds in 2021 while she was with a16z and sits on the NFT company’s board of directors.

42375581,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw99zT,1641340862,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Continues in Narrow Trading Range, Ether Pops Back Into the Green","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin continued to trade in a tight range, while ether turned to green.  Technician’s take: Some price-chart indicators show the potential for a short-term BTC bounce if support holds.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $45,856 -1.25%  (ETH): $3,790 +0.70%  Markets  S&P 500: 4,793 -0.063%  DJIA: 36,799 +0.59%  Nasdaq: 15,622 -1.33%  Gold: $1,814 +0.60%  Market moves  Bitcoin continued to trade in a narrow range during U.S. trading hours on Tuesday, while ether reversed Monday’s loss, turning to green.  At the time of writing, bitcoin, the oldest cryptocurrency, was trading slightly above $46,000, little changed in the past 24 hours, according to data from TradingView and Coinbase.  Data from blockchain data firm Glassnode shows that with bitcoin’s little movement, short-term holders are bearing most of the pain, which creates increased sell-side pressure.  The realized price, a metric that values each bitcoin at the time when it was last spent on the blockchain, of bitcoin’s short-term holders was trading at roughly $51,400, according to Glassnode, vs. $24,400 and $17,700 for the overall market and long-term holders, respectively.  Bitcoin’s short-term holders “on aggregate [are] underwater on their investment, and are the most likely to create sell-side resistance,” Glassnode wrote in its newsletter on Monday.  Ether, meanwhile, recovered some losses yesterday, moving above $3,800 at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView and Coinbase.  A few other layer 1 tokens also gained on Tuesday: Tokens of smart contract platforms such as Internet Computer, Cosmos and Celo were among some of the biggest winners of the day, based on data from Messari.  The lack of correlation of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) with bitcoin’s price may also put further pressure on bitcoin’s price, according to an analyst.  “The bull case remains for bitcoin, but it will be a much harder year as many traders will also focus on altcoins,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, the Americas, wrote in his daily market update on Tuesday.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Declines Toward Support at $44K-$45K as Analysts Await Price Bounce  Bitcoin was declining toward the $44,000-$45,000 support zone at the time of writing and is roughly flat over the past 24 hours. Indicators suggest a possible price bounce, albeit limited toward the $55,000 resistance level.  BTC has been stuck in a monthlong trading range after a near 20% crash in early December discouraged some buyers. Since then, the relative strength index (RSI) signaled a few oversold readings, although price gains have been muted compared with prior signals.  Katie Stockton, managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, a technical research firm, also noticed counter-trend signals which typically precede a price bounce.  A daily price close above $46,334 (at 8 p.m. ET) would confirm a positive signal, which would increase the possibility of a rise toward $55,644, according to Stockton.
