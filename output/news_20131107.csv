42376640,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bbap,1383863618,Federal Reserve economist says bitcoin is a remarkable technical achievement,"A member of the United States Federal Reserve banking system has written an analysis of bitcoin, stating that there are many positive aspects to it.  François R. Velde, senior economist of the Federal Reserve in Chicago, writes in his paper ""Bitcoin: A primer"" that bitcoin is a ""remarkable conceptual and technical achievement, which may well be used by existing financial institutions.""  ""The bitcoin protocol provides an elegant solution to the problem of creating a digital currency—i.e., how to regulate its issue, defeat counterfeiting and double-spending, and ensure that it can be conveyed safely—without relying on a single authority,"" Velde writes.  The news of these remarks coming from the US central banking authority come on the heels of bitcoin's price hitting a record high since it was first created back in 2009.  Andrew Beal, corporate attorney at Los Angeles-based firm Crowley Strategy, works primarily with startup technology companies. He thinks that this is a sign that the banking industry is taking bitcoin seriously, which is good for businesses that want to accept of otherwise build a company around BTC.  ""Hopefully this is representative of the Federal Reserve's confidence that bitcoin will play an increasingly important role in our country's, and the world's, financial systems. It can be argued that the lack of understanding is the biggest risk to bitcoin's further adoption and implementation,"" he said.  Velde refers to bitcoin in his paper as 'fiduciary currency'. He writes that means decentralized virtual currencies ""have no intrinsic value, and derive their value in exchange either from government fiat or from the belief that concerned itself with money because one main function of money is to free a debtor from his or her obligations.""  It's clear, then, that Velde believes that bitcoin's value is derived from people trading fiat currencies in exchange for bitcoin. As interest grows, that could require governments to enact policies regarding it.  ""Bitcoin is free of the power of the state, but it is also outside the protection of the state. How likely is bitcoin to remain so if it gains wide acceptance and the incentives to hijack it grow accordingly?""  US lawmakers are expected to meet soon regarding policy guidance for virtual currencies such as bitcoin.  Bitcoin's path thus far has been rocky: it has experienced a high degree of price volatility. The digital currency has also been heavily criticized for being used as a tool for fraud and the purchase of illegal goods.  “We need to develop thoughtful, nimble and sensible federal policies that protect the public without stifling innovation and economic growth,” said Senator Tom Carper, chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, in a recent statement regarding bitcoin and its illegal uses.  That sentiment echoes Velde's opinion, which is written with a tone of cautious optimism.  ""The many ingenious features of bitcoin try to emulate (the) properties of cash, but do so at some costs.""  via Forbes",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/07/federal-reserve-economist-says-bitcoin-is-a-remarkable-technical-achievement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ebcee53630e543f8313d0256eed1d527c3012cc-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376644,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bbfr,1383851726,The Netherlands' biggest food delivery network now accepts bitcoin,"The Netherlands' 10th biggest online retailer Thuisbezorgd.nl, a brand owned by takeaway.com, the European-wide food ordering and delivery website, has just announced it is now accepting payment in bitcoins.  The company has around 5,000 restaurants for which they take care of the order processing and payment. According to marketing manager Imad Qutob, it processes about one million orders each month.  Takeaway.com currently operates in nine different countries and their Dutch, German and Austrian takeaways are all slated to accept bitcoin. The company declined to respond directly to questions on whether it would expand its bitcoin service to Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Switzerland, the UK and Vietnam, although it did suggest that it seemed like the logical thing to do.  Half of Thuisbezorgd's customers pay in cash on delivery, but the other half pay with various forms of online payment, for which Thuisbezorgd adds a surcharge of €1 or more. Bitcoin customers won't have those surcharges.  Yesterday, the first day the company started taking bitcoin orders, they processed 250 bitcoin transactions out of about 30,000 orders in total.  An avid cryptocurrency devotee and fan of takeaway.com said: ""As a bitcoin user I find it nice to see a leading merchant platform such as takeaway.com/thuisbezorgd.nl adopt bitcoin as a payment method. I will definitely pay for my orders there with bitcoin, both for the ease of use of paying online and because of the lack of transaction fees that other methods take.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC,Richard Boase,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/07/the-netherlands-biggest-food-delivery-network-now-accepts-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0ec696122d1f875c00ca6b6cdf3e71f1ccbcc2a-1094x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376660,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bbxT,1383849137,Third largest cryptocurrency peercoin moves into spotlight with Vault of Satoshi deal,"Everyone knows the first person who walked on the moon. Lots of people know the second. But whoever remembers the third?  As the third largest cryptocurrency in the world, peercoin (also know as Peer-to-Peer Coin or PPCoin) is trying to bolster its reputation. It isn't doing too badly having just been accepted as an official currency by new Canadian exchange Vault of Satoshi. A local face-to-face peercoin exchange is also launching, and efforts are been made to get specialist event organizers to use peercoin as their official currency.  Market cap  Peercoin may be ‘the little altcoin that could’, but it still has a long way to go. Its market cap is the third largest, but it equates to just 37,000 BTC, or around $8.7m at the time of writing (that's about as much as the UK's Barclays bank earned every three hours last year).  Comparatively, litecoin’s market capitalisation is almost eight times as much, and you could fit peercoin into bitcoin 322 times. This shows just how consolidated the cryptocurrency market is.  Nevertheless, peercoin's founder Sunny King is trying hard to make it a success. At this point, following the decreasing involvement of Scott Nadal, who co-authored the white paper on peercoin in August 2012, King is its sole core developer.  The basis  Peercoin is based on the same SHA-256 proof of work mechanism that bitcoin uses, but it is also designed to produce coins in another way: proof of stake.  Whereas proof of work generates bitcoins using computational power, proof of stake relies on the coins that people already have in their possession.  The network gives people more coins based on how many they already have, under a minting algorithm that acknowledges the age of a coin (giving a whole new meaning to the phrase ‘old money’).  The idea is to create a system that uses less electricity than a proof of work-based system. Other benefits also include low inflation – transaction fees are destroyed to offset inflation from proof of stake minting – and longer-term stability.  “For the long term, bitcoin's mining generation would tend to zero, so mining would be supported mostly through transaction fees,” King said. “The security of [the] bitcoin network in the long-term would depend on whether transaction fees can sustain a good enough security [sic].”  Transaction fees  Bitcoin transaction fees will become more important to the network’s performance as mining rewards reduce, because they will become the miners’ main incentive.  Conversely, because proof of stake requires no transactions and no mining to generate coins, the currency does not have to rely on transaction fees to generate coins, according to King.  That being said, proof of stake still represents a miniscule part of peercoin's overall coin generation system. Most of the coins are still generated by miners, who King explains are needed in the early stage of a coin's development.  After all, you can't easily use proof of stake to generate coins when there are relatively few in existence, unless you start pre-mining, or create some kind of IPO-fuelled genesis block.  Hash rate  The hash rate for peercoin mining has been going up. It first spiked in April, and ranged under 1TH/sec until early September, when it began increasing exponentially.  This increase, aligned with the dramatic increase in bitcoin difficulty following a flood of ASIC miners onto the market, saw the hash rate increase from around 1TH/sec to 16TH/s in a month. It currently rests at around 14TH/s.  “The increase of computation power through ASIC is quite impressive,” said King. “This has accelerated the mining reduction because we use a curve that ties mining output to difficulty.”  That curve is based on this equation: block reward = 9999 / difficulty ^ (1/4). There is still “some time to go” before proof of stake generation overtakes proof of work rewards, he said.  King has big plans for the coin. “In the long term, I think there is a chance that energy efficient systems would surpass bitcoin's market share,” he said.  Community development  King isn't going to be able to do all of that on his own, though. Recently, John Manglaviti joined his team, effectively taking on community development.  Altcoin watchers will know that name. Manglaviti used to head up community development for feathercoin, a litecoin clone that currently ranks sixth in market cap (not bad for a coin that launched in April).  Manglaviti was at least partly responsible for building the feathercoin community when he was there. He also headed UNOCS, a community initiative that was supposed to bridge feathercoin, worldcoin and the since-imploded phenixcoin.  But then, Manglaviti walked away from both UNOCS and feathercoin, and ruffled a lot of feathers.  “People in the community were not very happy about that, which seemed a bit unfair considering how much time, effort and money he had put into feathercoin,” feathercoin founder Peter Bushnell told CoinDesk when Manglaviti left in September.  “Working with anonymous people is a challenge,” said Manglaviti, who says that he walked away from feathercoin and UNOCS to concentrate on his training business.  Phenixcoin’s development team let him down, he said. “It's hard to really perform due dilligence. I wish I would have done more with phenix.”  People in the feathercoin community may have been upset at Manglaviti, but he says that he talked about leaving the leadership role many times before he departed, so it shouldn’t have been a surprise.  Now, he’s working with King on building the same kind of community that he built around feathercoin before he left. This includes teams of volunteers (he calls them ‘volunpeers’) to help build energy around the coin and to lobby exchanges for inclusion.  Anonymity  But will Manglaviti’s involvement with peercoin last? He admits that he doesn’t know who Sunny King is.  The founder of peercoin is incredibly paranoid (and wouldn’t even talk to us on phone or Skype – only via IRC, or via the peercoin chat room).  There’s a single, anonymous point of failure for this coin, just as there was with phenixcoin. Why should he trust King?  Firstly, King argues that his other coin, primecoin, has a bigger community of developers, and that they will likely contribute to peercoin over time.  Is that happening now? “Not yet. But there are quite a number of good developers working on mining in primecoin. These are the type of talents that can understand [peercoin] code and maintain it as well,” King asserted.  Manglaviti explained that he and Bushnell hired King to develop an advanced checkpointing function for feathercoin, so he already knows the mystery developer’s work.  King introduced checkpointing in peercoin last year, to help secure it in its infancy. It helps to defend against 51% attacks.  ""Developers can operate a master node that broadcasts 'checkpoints', which tell other nodes to reach consensus on certain blocks,” he says, adding that it’s essentially a “consistency alert message”.  LocalPeercoins  While King takes care of business at the code level, the peercoin community is also getting things done. 'Fuzzybear', the administrator of Peercointalk.org, is launching LocalPeercoins, an online service much like LocalBitcoins.com, enabling peercoin enthusiasts to find others nearby who can trade currency with them.  This kind of thing, along with Vault of Satoshi’s adoption of peercoin, is hugely important to the currency. The only other exchanges offering USD conversions to Manglaviti’s knowledge are Coinmkt and Crypto-trade.  The other hurdle is getting a decent merchant network. That, in turn, needs payment processors. Now, it has one.  “Recently we have seen the first payment processor (coinpayments.net) and I think more would come as the market grows,” said King. “John is also in active contacts with many service providers, so working with them is one of our focuses.” Coinpayments went into public beta in mid-August.  The Trekkies  And then, there are the Trekkies. Trek Con Springfield is organised by BlackFish Entertainment. Taking place next May, the event expects at least 5,000 attendees, according to organizer Lawrence Blankenship, although it hopes to get up to 20,000. The event is using peercoin as its official currency.  How did all this come about? Because Manglaviti made it so. Blankenship works at JMark, the IT company at which Mangleviti is a trainer.  “We looked at the other coins but I don’t have friends in those coins,” said Blenkenship. “He has a team that will integrate it on the website and take it at the door.” These are the ‘volunpeers’ that Manglaviti talks about.  Coinpayments will handle online transactions, and peercoin is also hoping to have a mobile wallet available to support in-person payments.  Blenkenship said:  “We will reach out to vendors and prior to Trek Con taking off, we’ll have a vendor day where we will bring the vendors together and introduce them to peercoin and what we’ll be setting up with, and they may look at it too.""  That’s fun, but it’ll take a lot more than a single Trekkie conference to make peercoin fly. There are 16 of those events across the Northern US alone in October and November, and they’re hardly mainstream. It’s a start, though.  Manglaviti is also talking to at least one touring rock band to accept peercoin at venues. This is the way things will evolve with him – from the grass roots upwards. It’s an interesting contrast to peercoin’s top-down, single-developer culture.  If Sunny King is Oz behind the curtain, then he needs a community builder to move the coin from the shadows, and shine a light on it. Manglaviti could be that man – as long as history doesn’t repeat itself.

42376641,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bbc5,1383843083,Is bitcoin broken? Gavin Andresen responds to mining vulnerability paper,"Gavin Andresen, writing on the Bitcoin Foundation blog today formally addressed the recent paper published by two academics at Cornell University titled 'Majority is Not Enough: Bitcoin Mining Vulnerable' saying:  ""It is unfortunate (but entirely predictable) that the release of a not-yet-peer-reviewed paper generated so many sensationalistic headlines. Peer review works best when everybody involved is given time for conversation and debate without being contacted by reporters on deadline.""  The paper, which drew the attention of major news outlets around the world on Tuesday has already been the subject of some controversy within the bitcoin developer community which largely rebuffed the claims.  Andresen even commented publicly on Twitter saying that it was 'Not a big deal'.  In today's post he continued:    ""I’m not going to write about the specific claims in the paper; lots of smart people are, or soon will be, thinking really hard about the issues raised and whether or not the researcher’s model matches reality.      However, it is good to note that in my initial review, I believe the paper’s assertion of a fundamental flaw is based on some over-simplified assumptions about how the bitcoin mining market works.        This response is not meant to discourage academic research. In fact, as a Foundation, we believe that the strength of the open source development process is bringing together lots of incredibly smart people to consider and resolve long-term issues like those raised by researchers. To that point, we are proud sponsors of International Financial Cryptography Association. During their 18th international conference, they will be hosting the first Bitcoin Technical Workshop.            We encourage researchers to submit papers and expect to see excellent work that will add immense value to the protocol and community.""              Indeed, intelligent responses have already started to emerge. For example, Ed Felten on 'Freedom to Tinker' today published the idea of a 'Fair Weather' mining strategy, where miners simply collude to do whatever is best for themselves at the cost of the Selfish Mining pool.

42376656,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bbth,1383834128,"Hackers steal $1.2 Million of bitcoins from Inputs.io, a supposedly secure wallet service","UPDATE (8th November, 13:06 GMT):  In a phone interview with Australia's AM radio show Tradefortress responded to challenges that the theft was 'an inside job', though he insisted that he wouldn't be reporting the theft to the police because the bitcoins are untraceable and it would be impossible to track the culprit.  When asked about his age, Tradefortress told the publication: ""I'm over 18 but not much over.""  Tradefortresses' public identity still remains unknown, however his reputation on Bitcointalk seems to be questionable, with at least two members claiming to have been scammed by him for failing to deliver on coding projects he had already been paid for. He has said that he wishes to retain his anonymity as he now fears for his safety in light of this recent heist.  Tradefortress also runs coinchat.com as well as coinlenders.com.  ----------------------------------------  Tradefortress, the developer behind bitcoin web wallet Inputs.io, released a statement on his website today, after being forced to close it down in the aftermath of a major hacking incident, saying:  ""I know this doesn't mean much, but I'm sorry, and saying that I'm very sad that this happened is an understatement.""  Inputs.io  , which was intended to be a high-security bitcoin web wallet, was apparently hacked on the 23rd of October, when thieves stole bitcoins worth over $1.2m at current BPI prices. The statement, published this morning continues:    “Two hacks totalling about 4100 BTC have left Inputs.io unable to pay all user balances. The attacker compromised the hosting account through compromising email accounts (some very old, and without phone numbers attached, so it was easy to reset). The attacker was able to bypass 2FA due to a flaw on the server host side.      ""Database access was also obtained, however passwords are securely stored and are hashed on the client. ""If you stored more than 1 BTC, send an email to support@inputs.io with a bitcoin address (preferably, an offline, open source light/SPV wallet like Multibit or Electrum). Use the same email you're using on Inputs. Please don't store bitcoins on an internet connected device, regardless if it is your own or a service's.    ""I know this doesn't mean much, but I'm sorry, and saying that I'm very sad that this happened is an understatement.”    According to Hacker News, just as in the Bitfloor theft, in which 24,000 BTC were stolen, the bitcoins were stolen from the website’s ‘hot wallet’ - an online wallet which has to operate to process live withdrawals. However, it seems as if Inputs.io was keeping most if not all of their coins online, whereas other services often keep as much as 80% offline.  Inputs.io says that although the hack took place on October 23rd, even depositors who made deposits after that date are not safe, as other users were able to make withdrawals from the shared wallet.  By contrast to a service like Blockchain.info (which, although generally thought of as safe still suffered a security issue back in August), Inputs.io is a shared wallet that manages the balance of its users and their private keys giving them full access to all the bitcoins stored with them.  Blockchain.info account access is secured by an identifier/alias, password combination and two-factor authentication and is generally thought of as secure. However, as with any technology, nothing is foolproof. According to Bitcoin Talk forum user ‘masteroflove’:  “If the blockchain.info domain is compromised, the hacker can serve malicious JavaScript that will record your passwords and can get access to all your bitcoins. That's why it is recommend to use the Chrome or Firefox blockchain app. But even this isn't 100% foolproof as an attacker that gains access to blockchain's credentials can push a malicious update that will automatically update on your browser apps.”  Questions are now being asked publicly about Inputs.io's main developer Tradefortress, who, whilst still not widely known in public, claims to have a deep understanding of the complexities of security procedures for bitcoin wallets.  When CoinDesk approached Tradefortress for comment he informed us that ""the attacker was able to compromise older email accounts which were easily reset as they didn't have phone numbers attached. Compromising one older email account led to the compromise of another, eventually allowing them to reset the password for the hosting account and obtaining shell access after bypassing two-factor authentication on the host's side.""  He continued: “We don’t use client-side encryption; that’s hardly foolproof and gives people a false sense of security"".  When queried over how much Inputs.io will be able to reimburse users he responded somewhat obscurely: ""[We'll be able to refund] as much as 100%. For Inputs it is solely based on the amount. 1 BTC at the current sliding scale would be 74%, 2 BTC 65%... This figure is not final, and if we have leftover coins we'll be able to refund more.""  In other words: if you had less than 1 BTC on Inputs you should get it back, otherwise, be prepared to take a haircut.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Richard Boase,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/07/hackers-steal-12-million-of-bitcoins-from-inputsio-a-supposedly-secure-wallet-service,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e89e649d39083e23de86a80727e855d47552b9d-1000x717.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

GoCoin's seed round was funded by a group of investors, most notably Owen Van Natta, a former Chief Operating Officer of Facebook who has also held positions at Amazon and Zynga.  BitAngels  , a distributed angel fund that has invested in a number of BTC-based startups, has also participated in the round.  Founded in July 2013, GoCoin has been hard at work building a platform that will allow merchants to accept various virtual currencies.  ""GoCoin is currently a tight team of four full-time employees and a number of independent contractors working on specific short-term tasks,"" says Steve Beauregard, a co-founder and CEO of GoCoin.  Brock Pierce, who has invested in a number of online gaming startups and played an early role in the development of virtual goods, will serve as chairman of the board.  The company's payments platform is currently in a private beta with a small group of merchants, smoothing out the processing on its platform with bitcoin payments to start out with.  ""For our merchants in our early adopters program, there are 0% processing fees and no monthly fees,"" Beauregard told CoinDesk.  Although it faces competition from the likes of companies such as San Francisco-based Coinbase and Atlanta-based BitPay, GoCoin's headquarters are in Singapore, although it does also have an office in Santa Monica, California.  Its strategy is to operate in markets outside of the United States, specifically focusing on merchants in Asia and South America.  [post-quote]  The company has strategically chosen these areas ""where the challenges of accepting credit cards and purchasing goods and services online between even neighboring countries can be especially difficult,"" according to its press release announcing the seed funding.  E-commerce, online content and gaming are areas that will be a primary focus as it seeks out merchants to work with.  ""GoCoin is domiciled in Singapore, which is certainly the financial capital of SE Asia and arguably now the world. Our investors are from literally around the globe, as is our merchant base,"" says Beauregard.  Companies that are interested in using GoCoin's platform can expect simple compliance procedures to enable them to get started quickly with accepting bitcoin payments, according to Beauregard.  ""We are implementing reasonable KYC procedures for merchants signing up for our services. We have set thresholds which will step up the required KYC documentation once passed.""  And given the dominance of mobile phones over personal computers in Asia and South America, GoCoin has plans to build out a mobility strategy as well, says Beauregard.  ""We have some exciting plans for mobile that we will announce soon.""  GoCoin's fundraise follows the news last week that Circle, a new bitcoin startup by entrepreneur Jeremy Allaire, raised $9m from tech big-hitters Jim Breyer, Accel Partners and General Catalyst Partners, in the largest ever funding to date for a bitcoin company.  By comparison, Coinbase have received a total of $6.88m to date, and BitPay $2.51m. Other significant raises in bitcoin include Armory wallet ($600k) and bitcoin exchange Coinsetter ($500k).

Now you can add Subway sandwiches to your list of bitcoin-friendly products. If you live in Russia, that is.  What’s more, the Moscow-based Subway shop is offering a 10 percent discount for customers who are savvy enough to pay with the digital currency.  The shop is likely the first Subway sandwich shop anywhere in the world to accept bitcoin payments.  The advertisement appears in a photo tweeted on 3 November by bitcoin software developer Alberto Gomez Toribio. He says the photo was taken by a friend who is currently travelling in Russia.  Another photo, posted three months ago on Instagram by Konstantin Vinogradov, a manager at Russian venture capital firm Runa Capital, suggests that the Subway shop in question may be this outlet near the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (also known as Phystech).  It appears that the shop is using Mycelium, a mobile payment system demonstrated at the Bitcoin 2013 conference in May, to process the payments.  “[Mycelium] promotes local economies,” said Mycelium CTO Alexander Vasylchenko back in May. “It brings bitcoin to the community.”  Subway sandwich shops are run as franchises, so it's likely an enterprising local manager has taken the initiative to bring bitcoin to his or her community, rather than this being an endorsement of bitcoin by the Subway company.  We have reached out to Subway and are awaiting a comment from them.  The shop isn’t the first Russian business to accept bitcoin. In July this year, the 300-year-old Russian watch maker Raketa, founded in 1721 by Peter the Great, was reported to have begun taking payments by bitcoin.
