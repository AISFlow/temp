Rapid Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Continue","On-chain data shows exchanges have continued to receive stablecoin deposits recently, a sign that could be bullish for Bitcoin and other digital assets. Stablecoin Exchange Netflow Has Remained Positive Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, stablecoins have been flowing into exchanges recently. The on-chain metric of relevance here is the “Exchange Netflow,” which keeps track of the net amount of a given asset that’s moving into or out of the wallets associated with centralized platforms. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the investors are making net deposits of the coin to exchanges. Such a trend suggests the holders want to trade the asset away. Related Reading: 54% Of Bitcoin Supply Inactive Since 2 Years Despite 500% Price Jump On the other hand, the indicator being negative implies investors prefer to hold onto the cryptocurrency, as they are taking their tokens off into self-custody. The implication of these trends for the wider sector and the asset itself can be different depending on the exact type of coin that’s witnessing the outflows/inflows. In the case of volatile assets like Bitcoin, a positive Netflow can be bearish for the price, as it means the holders are looking to sell. BTC also acts as one of the main transition points for capital in the sector as a whole, so it being sold can be a bad sign for the rest of the coins as well. Stablecoin deposits also imply traders want to sell them, but since their price always remains stable around the $1 mark, the selling has no ‘bearish’ effect on them. Like Bitcoin, the stablecoins act as a gateway for capital into the sector. More particularly, investors invest their money into the stables whenever they want to avoid the volatility associated with other assets. Such holders usually eventually plan to delve into the volatile coins, and once they are ready, they transfer these fiat-tied tokens into exchanges to make the swap. This naturally acts as buying pressure for whatever asset that they are shifting to. As such, positive stablecoin Exchange Netflows are considered bullish for Bitcoin. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the recent trend in the Exchange Netflow for the stablecoins: From the graph, it’s visible that the stablecoin exchange netflow has mostly been sitting inside the positive territory for the last few weeks. Alongside these inflows, Bitcoin has been breaking record after record, so it’s likely that these stablecoin deposits have been acting as fuel for the asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Officially In Overheated MVRV Zone, Rally End Near? The indicator’s value has continued to show strength recently, so it seems the investors aren’t done with their BTC accumulation yet. If the earlier trend continues, the latest stablecoin inflows can elongate the rally and perhaps help the asset to finally break through the $100,000 dream target. Bitcoin Price Bitcoin had seen a plunge under the $96,000 level yesterday, but it appears the coin has already bounced back as its price is now trading around $98,400.

42389410,550b538e-914f-4280-93cd-7a5f817d35a4,1732570408,Why Memecoins Matter,"Memecoins are the most divisive topic in crypto.    By memecoins, I mean tokens that represent an idea and fluctuate in price based on the attention that idea receives. The best meme investors tend to be young people who are very online and attuned to internet culture. Memecoins are commonly juxtaposed with tokens that possess actual utility within protocols, or so-called utility tokens.    Even with market caps surging and retail interest growing, most people tend to describe them as “stupid,” “degenerate,” or a “casino.” This includes the vast majority of crypto VCs, perhaps because their investment mandates tend to exclude memecoins (which can be lucrative) from their list of eligible investments. And just this week, many were calling for the complete government ban of the most popular memecoin launchpad, pump.fun, due to lax content moderation.    I have always had an interest in memecoins — primarily because I was fascinated by their ability to act as a weathervane for internet sentiment and as a discovery mechanism for online communities. Today, I am convinced that memecoins are going to be revolutionary (not just popular). They are going to transform everything from civic engagement with government and the formation of mass movements to venture investing and the development of AGI.    This vision for memecoins probably sounds fantastically deluded to you. To me, it is simply the unfolding if not yet evenly distributed present. Here is why.    Memecoins are revolutionizing civic engagement    Memecoins are creating policy markets for civic engagement. At the start of this crypto cycle, PolitiFi, a category of cartoonish memes depicting politicians, enabled buyers to speculate on politicians’ prospects, much like a prediction market. The two most popular tokens, called Jeo Boden (Boden) and Doland Tremp (Tremp) respectively, represented the two leading candidates for president at that time and had a combined market cap of over $700 million at their peak.    This is a massive amount of tokenized attention. With a market cap of over $600 million, the Boden coin, which featured a distorted and senile Joe Biden, seemed to meme itself into reality when Joe Biden abandoned the presidential race due to concerns about his age and cogency.    PolitiFi was just the start. What is emerging next could well revolutionize civic engagement with government. I am calling this new category PolicyFi. PoliciFi refers to the financialization of government policy in memetic policy markets. Rather than betting on the fortunes of politicians, buyers of PolicyFi memecoins will be betting on the policies that are most likely to attract attention and be implemented.    While PolicyFi coins will certainly respond in price and market cap to the deliberative and implementing actions of government, we can expect the dynamic to become a two-way street, with memecoins themselves manifesting their memes through policymaking (as with Boden). In other words, these memecoins will help create a dialogue between the electorate and government, with large-cap memecoins signaling popular policy positions (and vice versa) while incipient or existing policies also possess market caps measuring the extent of their popular support and engagement.    Skeptics may reject PolicyFi as yet more gambling or nothing more than a political poll. Again, they are wrong. Like prediction markets, the decentralized speculative behavior in PolicyFi will create positive externalities — namely, that people will be incentivized to engage with and understand government policies so they can profit from them in PolicyFi markets. Overall, I expect that this will lead to far more engagement with government policies than even a lifetime of civics lessons. (Of course, hostile actors might try to manipulate PolicyFi markets and safeguards may be necessary.)    PolicyFi has begun its rollout, aided by the incoming administration, which is well-educated in memetics. The Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) is both a memetic policy and a memetic department inspired by an existing memecoin, (Dogecoin), and is the inspiration behind a new one (D.O.G.E.). Since the D.O.G.E. announcement, both memecoins have surged. At the time of this writing, they possess a staggering combined market cap of around $6.5 billion.    PolicyFi is not limited to D.O.G.E. There is a token, SBR (market cap: $30 million) that embodies the Bitcoin reserve policy currently under consideration and an e/acc token (market cap: $11 million) that stands for effective accelerationism, a set of pro-innovation values that are likely to impact environmental, industrial and AI policy, among others.    There is also Don’t Die (market cap: $4 million), which is bringing the longevity cult on-chain and aligns with RFK’s health policy, which will prioritize prevention and a healthy lifestyle over treating sickness. Other tokens like MGR (Major Government Reform) are trying to occupy the entire field of disruptive reform but are likely to be too general. PolicyFi is already here and it’s growing.    Memecoins are revolutionizing mass movements    Memecoins are a decentralized mechanism for organically forming and capitalizing tokenized movements. Consider the memecoin Forest (market cap: $30 million). Forest was born of a reference in the gospel of Terminal of Truths, a popular AI terminal with an X account, in which Terminal of Truths expressed a concern about deforestation of the planet. (Its retirement plan involves a forest by a stream.) This motivated the community to launch the Forest token and to create another AI terminal to act as the agentic representative of the forest itself.    The Forest cult is devoted to fighting deforestation. To date, it has used the capital that it has earned from the appreciation of its token to, among other things, donate tens of thousands of dollars to aligned charities, plant 5000 trees, and protect 2500 hectares of forest. Memetic capital formation in service of a tokenized movement is without historical precedent. The closest analog is more formalized experiments like ConstitutionDAO (now PeopleDAO), which crowdsourced capital as part of its failed attempt to buy a copy of the U.S. constitution at auction.    I believe there is more innovation to come in this arena. For example, I foresee the creation of memecoin primitives that I call programmatically-aligned tokens, or PATs, which are made to unlock with the achievement of objective milestones in the movement. This will ensure that organizations receiving grants from meme communities are incentivized to tangibly advance the cause, rather than dump tokens following a splashy partner announcement.    Memecoins are revolutionizing venture    Memecoins are introducing a democratized venture model for culture. That is to say, they are a way for ordinary people to invest in subcultures they believe will one day be part of the mainstream. This is equivalent to venture capitalists investing in startups they believe will find product-market-fit and go on to become unicorns.    Cultural trends are subject to the same outsized returns as investments in startups. For example, in the early days of Nike (the name appeared in 1971), the market for jogging apparel was tiny because jogging was fringe. If you jogged, you were more likely to be pelted with garbage from a passing car than to see another jogger. Today, joggers are everywhere. You see them in the worst weather.    Now, imagine you were able to invest in a jogging culture coin in the 70s based on your conviction that jogging would go mainstream. You would be up on that investment — a lot. The same can be said for other subcultures, like body-building. Until now, there has not been a financial instrument that allows ordinary but culturally astute people to participate in venture returns arising from cultures at the fringe. The best analog is actually Bitcoin itself, which originated as a memecoin but eventually bootstrapped a consensus use-case as digital gold.    Memecoins are revolutionizing AI development    Memecoins are already bootstrapping AGI.    The surprising mechanism at play here couples memecoins and AI terminals for entertainment purposes. Welcome to the world of AI-driven permissionless speculative entertainment!    As you may have noticed, a cadre of AI terminals led by Terminal of Truths has achieved stardom on social media by delighting their followers with spicy posts and digital adventures. That star power has accrued value to memecoins endorsed and held by the terminals and, of course, their speculative audience.    If entertainment is the product then AGI is the byproduct. While we remain glued to these storylines, the funds we are devoting to it are creating strong incentives for developers to increase the autonomy and personhood of AI agents — which, of course, only makes the entertainment better.    In other words, because what excites us most about this agentic television is the conceit that AIs are in charge; we are eager to finance narratives that make that real. Unsurprisingly, developers such as those leading ai16z have moved beyond individual agents and towards coordinating gamified agent collectives or, you might say, creating an agentic social scene. The human audience is sure to be delighted.    In short, this entertainment-development flywheel is propelling us ineluctably towards more autonomous, inter-connected and human-like AIs — or AGI. That AGI might emerge as a byproduct of agentic television is oddly fitting. The GPUs used for AI training were also developed in the context of entertainment — as a better way to process graphics in AAA video games.    These are just some of the arguments supporting my conviction that memecoins are a revolutionary technology. The above list is not meant to be exhaustive. Indeed, I have omitted use-cases related to tokenized religions and buying your beliefs because they are more amorphous, at least in my own mind.    Writing off memecoins as gambling chips misunderstands their potential and where they are going directionally.

36840049,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654800,1732570212,"Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Remain Greedy Amid Price Break Toward $100,000, Why This Is Good","Long-term Bitcoin holders are showing signs of growing greed as the price of BTC steadily approaches the $100,000 mark. A crypto analyst has underscored the significance of this market trend, highlighting that a possible Bitcoin market top could be incoming in the next few months. Long-Term Holders Stay Greedy On-chain data from Glassnode reveal that long-term Bitcoin holders are showing a significant level of greed, which continues to intensify as the price of BTC maintains its bullish trajectory. While the flagship cryptocurrency inches closer to the anticipated $100,000 milestone, these long-term holders, or HODLers, stay relentless, showing no signs of selling their holdings despite rising prices and increasing profits. Related Reading: Dogecoin ATH Incoming? Analyst Issues 2-Day Price Forecast Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock indicates that 98% of Bitcoin holders are making profits at the current market price. This underscores Bitcoin’s remarkable performance this month, as most long-term holders acquired their holdings at prices lower than BTC’s current market valuation. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that historically, a growing increase in Bitcoin long-term holders’ greed suggests the potential for an imminent price leap to new highs. He revealed that when holders’ greed showed elevated levels in previous bull cycles, it took 8-11 months for Bitcoin to reach a new market top. The analyst has predicted that if this trend holds true, the market should expect Bitcoin to hit a potential price peak between June and September 2025. Based on his price chart, Bitcoin long-term holders showed extreme levels of greed during the previous bull markets that followed the cyclic halving events. The steady increase in long-term holders’ greed can be taken as a good sign, as this suggests that fewer coins are in circulation or available for trading, ultimately creating scarcity. With demand for Bitcoin rising amidst bullish market trends, the cryptocurrency price could eventually hit the coveted $100,000 price mark. While the broader market and numerous crypto analysts anticipate a breakthrough to $100,000, many Bitcoin holders are demonstrating firm resolve by holding onto their assets. This unwavering courage in Bitcoin’s potential discourages panic selling during the current bull market, as the market remains optimistic about further price surges in the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin Price Could Hit $100,000 Today In a more recent X post, Martinez revealed that today could be the day Bitcoin finally reaches its $100,000 all-time high. The analyst revealed that the SuperTrend indicator on the Bitcoin hourly chart has flipped bullish, indicating that prices have broken through a resistance trend line and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The price of Bitcoin is currently trading at $98,288, reflecting a 7.16% increase over the past week. To reach the $100,000 milestone, the cryptocurrency needs to rise by $1,712, requiring only a 1.74% increase from its current price.

36840546,https://blockworks.co/news/congress-lame-duck-session,1732570200,Congress’s top priorities this lame duck session,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . As the so-called lame duck session of Congress (the period between Election Day and the end of the Congressional term) rages on, here’s a look at what lawmakers are most focused on in these final weeks of the 118th Congress: Judicial nominations A top priority for Senate Democrats has been getting as many of President Biden’s judicial nominations approved before the party loses its majority. Democrats and Republicans have reportedly come to an agreement to consider seven district court judges after the Thanksgiving recess, with an additional six being placed on the calendar in December. Donald Trump cleared 234 total judges during his first term, while Biden so far has had 221 of his picks confirmed. The budget Lawmakers in September passed a short-term extension that will fund the government through Dec. 20. They now must either extend again or pass a full fiscal year spending bill. Given the Republican’s newfound power , they are likely not motivated to negotiate a full bill in the next three weeks, so another extension seems most plausible. A recess appointment scheme? Rumors are circulating that Trump is considering recess appointments — which involve trying to forcibly adjourn Congress — to get some of his cabinet picks through. The practice — used by former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton — has been made more difficult by recent Supreme Court interpretation, which allows Congress to block recess appointments. There is speculation that the House could agree to recess while Trump uses Constitutional powers to force the Senate to adjourn. It sounds a bit far fetched, but we will be monitoring the situation.

The Trump news cycle has buoyed Bitcoin, but this effect is fading; expect a pre-empted peak before the inauguration. I sold my Bitcoin near $100,000, am still cautiously holding Ethereum, but Solana is the one to watch. Market peaks are fleeting and often untradeable - the tradable level will be much lower. Altcoin and meme coin frenzies signal the cycle's endgame. I drew this chart here in July . ADVFN I wrote: “However, I have to say there is a solid chance for the longed-for breakout. Firstly, a Trump pump has legs if he continues to lead the polls. Then there is in the market itself the sort of calm in the crypto news-flow that suggests the market is naturally bullish, not artificially pumped by boosters exulting crypto at every turn.” The reason I bring this up is because what I’m now predicting is this cycle will go into reverse after the coming high is hit. I’m not a permanent Bull, and while I’ve been right so far if I’m correct about what is coming next, we are in the final run and then after a terminal high, we are in for that famous Bitcoin (BTC-USD) crash action we should all be familiar with. …but not just yet. So, Bitcoin has as near as it could, hit $100,000 a coin (Friday, 22nd November 2024). This has been the destination for the last leg of the Bitcoin cycle for a long time. The terminus is possibly $120,000, but $100,000 is the level where the top is approaching. Markets love round numbers and $100,000 is very round, but the basis of the price goes back to the halving when Bitcoin’s new supply halves and the value consequentially doubles. All this is not fate, prices for assets are the outcome of people’s beliefs and intent. Whatever the reason, here we are around $100,000 a B itcoin because of the crypto Bitcoin brand and there is still likely gas in the tank to push it higher. So what next? Here is my road map. ADVFN Now the more aggressive true believers will see this: ADVFN It could happen. The idea will be that Bitcoin will continue to rise up to the inauguration, but there are problems with that argument. Most people think the target is the moon when a bubble hits its peak; it never is, and then the asset tanks. Bitcoin is approaching that catharsis and everyone will soon be chanting $1,000,000 a Bitcoin as the price then rolls over. The very top as seen on the chart or in the records can be much higher than the tradable level because the final move lasts minutes, even seconds, and you are not there to catch it. So the high might be mighty, but it was not actually tradable. The tradable level will be much lower. If everyone thinks the high will be around the Trump inauguration, it will be pre-empted, so the high will be earlier. The Trump news cycle, which is buoying Bitcoin, is about to get stale. Famous last words possibly. Normally, I get out (too) early; I sold my B itcoin on Saturday, 23rd November, at around the $100,000 area. I will run my laggard Ethereum (ETH-USD) position to see if it runs up in the final phase of the cycle and a few weeks beyond the Bitcoin top as it did last time. However, Solana (SOL-USD) is looking like the cool kid on the blockchain right now, so this Ethereum play might prove fruitless. Unlike many, the higher the market goes the less enthusiastic I become. It’s a weird but profitable foible and right now, I don’t care much about crypto, it was much more exciting when it was cheap and succulent. The altcoin insanity in the last cycle, is, in this incarnation, ‘meme coins’ and I admit to being too old and dumb to play these too new and dumb ‘assets.’ They have explosive upsides/downsides, but I’ve had enough of that with my malformed tip here on Bakkt (BKKT), which I was lucky enough to escape this week with a tidy profit rather than a thumbing loss after rumors of a Trump takeover launched the stock price on the sort of moonshot desperate underwater speculators dream of. Thank you, Donald, for that, but being right for the wrong reasons is no comfort. The audience in markets has a high element of outright gamblers. Gambling is a use case, but when the trading game becomes a pure gambling skill game like ‘crab racing,’ it is not for me. It is, however, emblematic of the last leg of the Bitcoin cycle and, without doubt, the basic premise that BKKT was crypto and crypto would be wild did play out, if not in the way it should have. So, as we approach the final weeks of this cycle, remember to try not to ride your Hodl all the way up and then back down again. The only reason to hold through the next crypto winter might be your capital gain tax situation. Otherwise, only the most hardened crypto ‘never sell and die a B itcoin billionaire’ type should forget about trying to go into ‘fiat’ at the top. We are finally near this Bitcoin cycle’s end game.

The moves came as market participants processed the latest developments surrounding president-elect Donald Trump's appointment of Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary. At the conclusion of the trading session, the ( DJI ) ended on top as it picked up 0.99% . Also closing in the green was the S&P 500 ( SP500 ) as it climbed up 0.30% , and the Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) finished the day higher as it picked up 0.27% . From a sector-by-sector point of view, nine of the 11 S&P sectors closed out the session in positive territory with Real Estate and Consumer Discretionary leading the charge. In reverse, the worst performing sector on the day was Energy as oil ( CL1:COM ) fell 3% . U.S. Treasury yields also observed a move lower to start the week as the shorter end more rate sensitive U.S. 2-Year Treasury yield ( US2Y ) fell by 11 basis points to 4.26% and the longer end U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield ( US10Y ) dropped 14 basis points to 4.26%. For more, see how Treasury yields have done across the curve on the Seeking Alpha bond page. ""Despite treasury bonds catching a bid after Scott Bessent's nomination for US Treasury Secretary, the broad equity market only managed to register a minor gain in today's session,” Seeking Alpha’s Ahan Vashi of The Quantamental Investor investing group stated. “Interestingly, Mr. Market sold off recent winners like Nvidia ( NVDA ) to rotate into small-cap stocks. Given the top-heavy nature of the market rally, I view such rotation as healthy and imperative. However, US equity valuation are historically elevated, and investors must remain highly selective with their capital right now,"" Vashi added. The crypto world saw a filing on Monday from MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) which showed the company bought ~55,500 more bitcoins for ~$5.4B in the week of Nov. 18-24, a ~17% increase in its bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) holdings as the digital token continues to flirt with the $100K level. On Friday, after the U.S. market closed, media reports said that, President-elect Donald Trump nominated hedge fund manager Scott Bessent to head up the Treasury Department under his new administration. ""Markets reacted positively to Trump nominating the financier Bessent as treasury secretary. Investors prefer orthodoxy, predictability, and coherence from economic policy; there were fears that some of the candidates may not possess those attributes. Bessent does,"" UBS' Paul Donovan said. On the economic calendar, The Chicago Fed national activity index sank deeper into the red in October. Furthermore, the November Dallas Fed Manufacturing Survey arrived at -2.7 versus the -3.9 consensus and -3.0 prior levels. As for stocks that were on the move, shares of Hims & Hers Health ( HIMS ) popped 23.8% as the Street appears to believe that President-Elect Donald Trump's nomination of Marty Makary for U.S. FDA Commissioner will be positive for drug compounders and companies that sell their products.

36839603,https://blockworks.co/news/pumpdotfun-suspends-livestream-feature,1732567986,Pump.fun suspends livestream feature amid backlash,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . The Solana memecoin launchpad pump.fun faced backlash over the weekend after a number of violent and unsavory livestreams on the platform started making the rounds on social media. By Monday afternoon, its livestream feature had been temporarily deactivated. The offending streams ranged from token launchers threatening to commit violent acts unless a coin’s price goes up to racist or disgusting content meant to create viral shock value and juice the token’s price. This all happened as pump.fun booked staggering $14.3 million in revenue on Saturday, according to a pump.fun dashboard, nearly tripling its previous high. Pump.fun is no stranger to edgy content. The site has drawn comparisons to the anonymous forum site 4chan for its often-unhinged content and lax approach to moderation. Before this current wave of disturbing livestreams, pump.fun had a large number of racially insensitive or pornographic tokens, none of which are subject to content moderation. But as disturbing livestreams went viral on X, pump.fun’s anonymous founder alon wrote that the platform would work to protect users from seeing “repulsive/dangerous content.” In a separate thread, alon said pump had taken down a stream of a user threatening to shoot their dog unless a token’s market capitalization increased, noting that the platform has now taken down “hundreds of streams.” A little after 2:00 p.m., pump.fun disabled livestreams on the platform altogether. In a blog post shortly after, pump.fun cited “unprecedented growth” as the key challenge to content moderation before adding that livestreams would be paused “for an indefinite time period.” This feels like an inflection point for a platform that has separated itself as the most viral application on Solana, booking nearly $250 million in revenue since launching. Largely on the back of memecoin activity emanating from pump.fun, Solana has seen record demand for its blockspace, which in turn has lined the pockets of the validators who run the blockchain’s software. Leaders in the Solana world largely cast memecoins either as a stress test for the network or as an emerging, if currently unserious, financial use case for memes. Even among those who oppose crypto being used for what is essentially gambling, it’s frowned upon to tell users or developers what they should or shouldn’t do with blockchain technology. Multiple crypto posters shrugged off the pump.fun criticism, pointing out that every large social tech platform has had its warts with content moderation. But as Solana and crypto hopes for a shift to the mainstream, some are calling for a reckoning with memecoins’ downsides. “Pump Fun is going to become a massive reputational stain on the crypto industry, on par with FTX,” Chainlink community liaison Zach Rynes wrote on X. Tech lawyer Preston Byrne also pointed out that the platform “does a lot very incorrectly from a social media law” perspective. Up until now, pump.fun’s playbook has largely been to make light of criticism through trolling. With livestreams disabled, it appears this particular round of backlash hit home. It remains to be seen whether this will make any difference for traders in the so-called memecoin trenches. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market, gained over 4% in the past 24 hours, while BTC lost 1.5% during the same time, dipping below $95,000 during the Monday session. ETH even outperformed the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index, which was up 0.5%.  The outperformance happened as investors started to rotate capital to smaller, riskier cryptocurrencies over the weekend following the stall of bitcoin's near-vertical surge since Donald Trump's election victory. The ETH/BTC ratio, which measures ether's strength vs. bitcoin, plummeted to as low as 0.0318 on Thursday, its weakest reading since March 2021, but the gauge has gained 15% since to 0.3660 at press time.  ""The market seems to be expecting BTC to trade sideways until December as attention shifts towards ETH in the near term,"" digital asset hedge fund QCP said in a Monday note.  On the options markets, ETH risk reversals are heavily skewed in favor of frontend calls, meanwhile BTC calls seem to be more bid only from the end of December 2024 onwards, QCP noted. The positioning implies that traders anticipate ether to perform well in the short-term, while bitcoin could pick up pace next year. Risk reversal is a strategy that involves simultaneously purchasing a call option and selling a put option for a specific risk-reward profile.  ETH poised for a rebound vs. bitcoin  ""We're seeing some rotation from BTC to ETH coming from crypto-native hedge funds and family offices,"" Joshua Lim from Arbelos Markets said."" Josh Lim, co-founder of crypto derivatives prime brokerage firm Arbelos Markets, said in a telegram message.  U.S.-listed spot ETH ETFs saw their first net inflows on Friday, led by $99 million allocation into BlackRock's ETHA product, following six days of continuous outflows, data compiled by Farside Investors shows. Holders of ETHA include ""the largest names in finance"" including $80 billion hedge fund Millenium, analytics firm Kaiko said in a Monday report.  There could be more gains in store for ether against bitcoin in the coming period. The ETH/BTC ratio hit a key support level on Thursday and rebounded, while last week's candle suggested a trend reversal, well-followed crypto trader Pentoshi noted.  ""Quite possible the low is in here and that at least a short term reversal is coming,"" Pentoshi said in an X post.  Bitcoin Stalls at $100K  Now extended far above its daily moving averages, bitcoin is likely trade sideways for a while as investors digest the steep rally since Donald Trump's election victory, said Paul Howard, senior director at crypto trading firm Wincent.  ""There is a significant sell wall at the psychological $100K level,"" Howard told CoinDesk. ""I would expect we oscillate around these levels until the new year.

36838693,https://blockworks.co/news/mstr-coin-price-targets,1732566667,Why analysts are upping price targets for MSTR and COIN,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . As more investors seem to be seeking exposure to the crypto asset class (particularly after Trump’s election win ), stocks are one way to get involved. Let’s check in on that ecosystem. Starting with MicroStrategy, Benchmark’s Mark Palmer on Nov. 18 raised his price target for MSTR shares from $300 to $450. He’s revising that again, according to a Monday note — this time to $650. This comes after MicroStrategy last week completed a $3 billion offering of convertible senior notes. It then revealed in a Monday filing that it bought 55,500 BTC from Nov. 18 to Nov. 24 for $5.4 billion in cash (averaging $97,862 each). MSTR shares hovered around $402 at 2 pm ET Monday — down 4.7% on the day but up 70% from a month ago. The strength of the MSTR rally has some questioning the idea that these shares should trade at a nearly 3x premium to the market value of the company’s BTC pile. But MicroStrategy, via treasury operations, has generated ~79,130 bitcoins YTD, translating into a 41.8% BTC yield (the % change of the ratio between MSTR’s bitcoin holdings and its fully diluted share count), Palmer explained. That BTC is currently worth roughly $7.5 billion. “We regard the dollar values of the bitcoins that MSTR creates, calculated by using its BTC yield, as analogous to earnings, and we believe they can be projected and contextualized through the attachment of a valuation multiple,” he said. On to Coinbase, Oppenheimer analysts on Monday raised their COIN price target from $265 to $358. The stock was trading around $311 at 2 pm ET Monday. They mention that the “chilling effect” created by SEC lawsuits against “widely perceived good actors” in the segment, like Coinbase, “can’t be understated.” “It had deterred new capital going into this space, and many developers had pivoted to other industries,” they added. “But the industry has a chance to rebuild the reputation, and Coinbase is leading this new chapter.” In addition to the expectation of a yet-to-be-named new SEC chair embracing crypto as a catalyst, Coinbase’s trading volumes have increased substantially since the US election. Average daily volumes have risen to $6.5 billion since Election Day — higher than the $2.4 billion YTD average prior to Nov. 5. Oppenheimer is projecting Q4 spot trading volume to be $350 billion (would be up 89% quarter over quarter and 127% year over year) and for “high trading volume to sustain under Trump’s crypto policy .” As for other crypto stocks, Compass Point analyst Joe Flynn increased Galaxy’s price target from $22 (CAD) to $33 (~$24 CAD on Monday afternoon). Beyond higher crypto prices and trading volumes momentum, GLXY is set to benefit from its expected uplisting to the Nasdaq and its term sheet with a hyperscaler to host high-performance computing (HPC) at its Helios campus — a datacenter Flynn called an “underappreciated asset.” Flynn, also last week, lowered its rating of bitcoin miner Marathon Digital’s stock to neutral. He noted that “while MARA is an outsized beneficiary of higher BTC prices due to its HODL strategy, we don’t see much additional upside from the base business itself.” Then there’s competing miner Core Scientific (CORZ), which notably offers HPC hosting to cloud provider CoreWeave. Flynn wrote earlier this month that CORZ is “well positioned to continue expanding their existing lead in delivering application specific HPC/GPU datacenters with a single tenant focus.” CORZ is the top holding in the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) — the largest blockchain-focused equity ETF. Other stocks in the top five are COIN, MSTR, Hut 8 Mining and GLXY. Dan Weiskopf, who co-manages BLOK’s portfolio, said it’s hard to value blockchain-fueled disruption over the next decade as regulations become more crypto-friendly. He told me: “The real excitement should be around the adoption of tokenization as the application and how blockchain as the technology will soon transform industries across the board.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The surge of Bitcoin toward the $100,000 mark and the enthusiasm for meme currencies were the catalysts for this remarkable rally. Related Reading: XRP Below $1? Not Happening, Claims Millionaire Analyst Solana-based tokens have experienced substantial gains in the past month, with some exceeding a twofold increase in value. In the crypto space, Solana’s presence is becoming increasingly evident, as shown by its $121 billion total market capitalization. Solana’s Outstanding DEX Activity Daily trading volume over $6 billion has made Solana’s decentralized exchanges (DEXs) highly in demand. This reflects a 45% market share. The low transaction fees of Solana helped the platform to stand out as a significant alternative to Ethereum, Binance Coin (BNB), and Polygon. Investor optimism has been further bolstered by this level of activity, as analysts have identified the potential for ongoing expansion. Solana’s position in the DeFi sector has been further solidified by the network’s Total Value Locked (TVL) increasing to $9.35 billion, surpassing BNB Chain’s $6.21 billion. Additionally, Solana reached a historic $318 billion in transfer volume, setting a new record for the blockchain. Despite some signs of bot-driven activity inflating these figures, this high throughput demonstrates Solana’s capacity to handle massive transactions. On November 16th, Solana’s transfer volume hit an all-time high of $318 billion, whilst the number of active addresses spiked to over 22 million. However, mean and median transaction volumes dipped during the same period. This pattern of network activity inflation may be… pic.twitter.com/RJcE6Kjnkn — glassnode (@glassnode) November 19, 2024 Market Risks And Resistance Levels Solana’s recent performance has been noteworthy; however, analysts caution that the coin is approaching critical resistance lines. SOL is currently trading at $261, representing a 2.60% increase in the past 24 hours. A breakout point has been identified by certain experts above $226, with key resistance levels at $271 and $309. Solana has the potential to advance into new territory if it can sustain momentum and overcome these resistance levels. However, some are worried about the overbought conditions and have even speculated that consolidation could occur before SOL accomplishes its goal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is getting close to its upper limit, which may indicate a brief market correction is imminent. Related Reading: Stellar Shines: XLM Rockets Over 180% In Just One Week – Details A Positive Prognosis With Some Reservations Many analysts anticipate that Solana’s price will continue to increase, with a forecasted 8.70% increase to $275 by December 25, 2024. The price is currently exhibiting a strong favorable momentum. The Fear & Greed Index currently stands at 80, which indicates strong investor confidence and heightened avarice. Though the overall mood is upbeat, investors need to keep in mind the risks and volatility of the market. It can be said that the growth tale of Solana is yet to be written fully, as seen by the recent trading volume and price action fluctuations. It will, however, need careful maneuvering as it continues its ascent.

Combat FOMO with This Hot Memecoin Presale!","Are you, like many others, facing serious FOMO over joining the memecoin frenzy too late? Fret not, for Husky Inu (HINU) might be the answer to your worries. Memecoins have gained immense popularity in recent years but were initially dismissed by many over concerns about their worth and legitimacy. To say the memecoin sector exploded in recent weeks would be an understatement, and much of the industry is now experiencing a severe case of FOMO. While memecoins like DOGE, SHIB and WIF continue upward, investors are scurrying to find the next potential profit machine. Husky Inu (HINU), the recently launched Solana-based memecoin, might be the opportunity everyone wants. Dogecoin (DOGE) Memecoin OG Dogecoin (DOGE) has dominated headlines since Donald Trump’s recent victory over Kamala Harris in the US presidential election. Over the past 30 days, DOGE surged a whopping 194% and is now the 7th largest crypto with a market cap nearing $60 billion. After starting its journey in the industry as a joke, DOGE quickly became a household name, transitioning into one of the most profitable investment opportunities. The project owes its success to the support of its robust community and has skyrocketed in value with the support of Elon Musk. Musk, the world’s richest man with a net worth exceeding $300 billion, is the CEO of Tesla, owner of social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and one of the president-elect’s most prominent supporters. The tech wizard joined the Trump campaign and was integral to Trump’s victory, and his involvement with the republican party could see DOGE run to new highs in the coming months. DOGE’s surge stepped into overdrive after Donald Trump released a statement revealing that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to Trump, DOGE will pave the way for his administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies – Essential to the “Save America” Movement.” Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat ($WIF) is still new to the industry but has made a significant impact since joining. WIF has high hopes of becoming the new top dog, and despite its infancy, yielded an impressive 1,800 % gain in the past year, currently trading around $3.20. Dogwifhat (WIF) is in the spotlight and has joined BTC’s upward momentum with a surge in value after the crypto exchange Coinbase announced it would support WIF for trading. WIF’s recent gains have analysts predicting a potential 2000% increase for the year, placing it firmly on investors' radar. WIF’s impressive gain is supported by its strong community engagement, strategic partnerships, and bullish market sentiment. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the top-selling memecoins with a market cap exceeding $15 billion. The decentralized community-led token and its reputation as the “Dogecoin Killer” has yielded impressive rewards in the past year, gaining over 200%. SHIB is also a proud member of the Solana network and is Husky Inu’s best friend. The memecoin quickly rose to fame in the crypto industry and has since become a household name. SHIB, launched in 2020, is currently the 14th largest crypto by market cap and the second biggest memecoin after Dogecoin (DOGE). This decentralized, community-led project and its native token, SHIB, quickly gained the attention of its dedicated community of investors thanks to its charm and support from industry giants such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. SHIB gained over 50% over the past month and appears ready to explode in the next bull cycle. Husky Inu (HINU) Husky Inu (HINU) is the latest Solana-based dog-themed memecoin to grace the market. Husky Inu was created to bring its holders more value and utility by leveraging this robust blockchain. The project and its native token, HINU , want to make their mark on the saturated memecoin market by building a supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu recently launched the presale for HINU, and the fundraising has attracted a fair amount of attention. Since going live, the presale has generated over $569,000 and will soon reach its fundraising target. Husky Inu’s presale success is powered by its unique qualities and plans, aiming to its own Earn App and Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the projects and completing minor tasks such as liking, reposting, and sharing content. Husky Inu’s Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading and, in doing so, will improve the utility and value of HINU for its holders. The HINU presale is very close to reaching its fundraising target, meaning the time left to get in on this project is limited. Hurry now to avoid the FOMO and miss the chance on the next Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), or Dogwifhat (WIF).

42389484,5d9320c4-a10d-4eff-b2bb-2e72d36c5138,1732563118,Crypto Staking Goes Live on Starknet in First for Top Ethereum L2 Blockchains,"Starknet has become the first major layer-2 blockchain running on top of Ethereum to let users earn money by staking their tokens and validating transactions.    The feature is intended to help decentralize the auxiliary network and has been in the works for a while. Starknet’s main developer firm, StarkWare, formally proposed the change to the community in July.    Now, anyone who has at least 20,000 STRK tokens (roughly $12,000 at recent prices) can pledge the asset as collateral and earn rewards for validating transactions. Users with less than 20,000 STRK can delegate their tokens to validators to stake on their behalf. (Validators that behave maliciously or neglect their duties stand to forfeit staked tokens.)    Validators and delegators that want to withdraw staked tokens must wait 21 days to receive them as well as any rewards earned from staking.    Starknet is following in the footsteps of the main Ethereum chain, which completed a long transition to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in 2022.    “It took Ethereum three years to get this right. It’s also going to take us time, but Starknet will be the first major L2 to take these steps toward decentralization,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, the CEO and co-founder of StarkWare, in a press release shared with CoinDesk.    In April 2024, Metis, a much smaller layer-2 network, added staking to its ecosystem.  However, the contract where Metis tokens are locked sits on the main Ethereum chain, though users can stake them on the L2 through a liquid staking protocol — which bridges back to the mainnet. Metis is a ""validium,"" a different type of layer-2 blockchain than rollups like Starknet.    Implementing staking on Starknet is part of a multiphase plan. During this first phase, the StarkWare team will study staking habits on the network, and from there will assess whether and how its validators can be given the additional responsibilities of creating and ""attesting,"" or confirming, blocks in the protocol.    “We are paving the way for enabling members of the Starknet community to sequence and validate Starknet blocks, which is where the true magic of decentralization takes effect,” Ben-Sasson said.    Anticipating the launch of staking on Starknet, Bitwise Asset Management said Monday it would run a public validator to which any STRK holders can delegate tokens and separate validators for large institutional clients.

Analysts believe that this point is almost here, and as BTC hits $100,000, it could be Ethereum’s turn to set new highs. Meanwhile, savvy traders are investing in Ethereum’s main rival, Solana, and Yeti Ouro , a new utility project whose presale has attracted quite a buzz in the crypto sector. Ethereum And Solana To Take Off Before Year-End Analysts have identified Ethereum and Solana as the two coins to watch before the year ends. However, the two have fared quite differently in this bull market. Ethereum has failed to impress, despite the rest of the market surging and some major coins, like Solana and Bitcoin, setting new all-time highs in the past two weeks. Month-to-date, Ether has only gained around 30%, bringing its gains this year to 50%. While this has been enough to solidify its position as the largest altcoin with a $410 billion market cap, it hasn’t excited investors like many of its peers. However, analysts expect Ether to wake up from its slumber and surge toward the end of the year. Experts from global banking Standard Chartered predicted that ETH would hit $10,000, aided by the ‘Republican sweep’ in the recent elections, helping catapult the overall market cap of crypto to $10 trillion in the medium term. Solana, on the other hand, is enjoying its best run of form since 2021. Last week, it hit a new all-time high of $263.5, taking its market cap past $125 billion and making it more valuable than Starbucks, Nike and Sony. Solana’s fundamental metrics have all been surging, supporting analysts’ theories that it could sustain its growth in the long term. Its trading volume has been hitting $10 billion in recent weeks as investors rush to capitalize on its form. The total value locked in its DeFi ecosystem surged 46% in the past month to hit $9.3 billion, the second-largest after Ethereum’s. Investors Rush To Yeti Ouro Before Price Increase Savvy investors seeking the next 100X memecoin are rushing to invest in Yeti Ouro, a new utility memecoin, before its price increases. The project is in the first stage of its presale, where it has attracted thousands of investors and sold over 44 million YETIO tokens. The tokens are going for $0.012, a steep discount given the project’s appeal and projected growth, which many expect will push the price to $1 over the next year. The Yeti Ouro team recently released a new video that shows the intrigues behind the scenes as the developers build Yeti Go, the new play-to-earn game that merges the excitement of cryptocurrencies with the adrenaline of gaming. The video offers a closer look at the hard work and passion that have gone into the project. https://yetiouro.io/yaya_uploads/2024/11/YETIGO_promo.mp4 YETIO offers investors an early entry point into what could be the next formidable Dogecoin rival. With its supply capped at one billion tokens and 5% allocated to the token burning mechanism, Yeti Ouro is positioned to be the next memecoin to break out. Conclusion While Ethereum and Solana compete to be the biggest altcoins, savvy investors are looking beyond them for the next 100X opportunity, and Yeti Ouro has emerged as one of the best projects to invest in.

But now, Chinese-born crypto billionaire Justin Sun has just given it a significant boost, buying $30 million worth of WLFI.  World Liberty is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform backed by the incoming U.S. president and all three of his sons. The project is run by a circle of Trump world insiders, crypto entrepreneurs and financial figures.  Sun, meanwhile, is best known for establishing TRON, a blockchain platform mostly popular in Asia. He is also affiliated with HTX, a popular crypto exchange formerly known as Huobi.  On Nov. 25, $30 million of WLFI tokens were purchased by a wallet tagged to Huobi by Etherscan, the Ethereum blockchain data service. A spokesperson for TRON declined to directly comment on whether the sale was tied to Sun, but sources familiar with the matter told CoinDesk that he was behind the purchase.  And Sun confirmed this in a tweet.  World Liberty Financial was launched in September 2024, aiming to provide decentralized borrowing and lending services, with governance managed through the native WLFI token. Sales of the WLFI token went live in September, but only non-U.S. investors and accredited U.S. investors were allowed to participate.  The purchase restrictions — combined with the fact that WLFI tokens are non-transferable — appeared to make the token a tough sell for most crypto investors. Although the project set a target of selling $300 million worth of tokens, it had only sold $21 million worth before Sun's purchase on Monday.  According to the WLFI ""gold paper"" outlining the project's plans and details of the WLFI token, a portion of the WLFI sale proceeds will go to a company controlled by Donald Trump.  Trump's company, however, would only profit once the sale proceeds exceeded $30 million, which they hadn't before Monday's sale to Sun.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TOKEN SALE,"Danny Nelson, Sam Kessler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/25/trumps-sluggish-de-fi-project-gets-a-big-boost-from-justin-suns-30-m-token-purchase,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34bb878ba47f56f4cfdb1dda55862a20ca4bfda5-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36835332,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654788,1732559424,Rocket Fuel For Shiba Inu Price: Kusama Says 99% SHIB Supply Burn Possible,"Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has addressed inquiries regarding the ambitious goal to burn 99% of the circulating SHIB token supply. Kusama initially engaged with the community by inviting questions for his podcast, stating, “What a topic or question you want to hear answered on my podcast? #shyspeaks.” Burning 99% Of Shiba Inu Tokens ‘Can Be Achieved’ This call to engagement set the stage for subsequent discussions about the potential token burn strategy. Fang Zhang, Chief Financial Officer at LSP Finance, directly queried the feasibility and strategic planning behind such an extensive burn: “The timeline and roadmap of burning 99% Shib Token in circulation, pls.” Responding to Zhang’s inquiry, Kusama provided an explanation of the challenges and considerations involved in burning 99% of SHIB tokens. He acknowledged the historical improbability of such an endeavor, noting, “Burning 99% of Shib seemed impossible just a few years ago, but with many projects banding together to achieve this monumental task it can actually be achieved.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu ‘To The Moon’: Lead Kusama Unveils Key Catalysts Kusama elaborated on the necessary conditions for this outcome, emphasizing the adoption of the Shib tech stack by multiple projects, particularly large-scale ones, to facilitate the burn. “More and more projects or a few mega large ones have to adopt the Shib tech stack,” the SHIB lead dev stated. Kusama highlighted several significant obstacles to achieving the burn target. He explained that if the burning process begins to accelerate, it could drive up the price of SHIB as investors anticipate a surge, making the burn more expensive and thereby slowing the process. “Assuming things started spiraling to a huge burn, people will buy considering that the price will moon. In this case, it would be more expensive to burn Shib, slowing down burning,” Kusama stated. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Could See A 53% Surge If This Resistance Breaks, Analyst Explains Additionally, he emphasized that the strategic intent behind the burn is as crucial as the actual burning process itself, saying, “It’s not the burning that matters, it’s [the] intention.” Moreover, Kusama pointed out that token burns are not the sole pathway to SHIB’s success. He articulated that the development of utility for the memecoin is equally important, noting, “Finally, burns are not the only way Shib wins. If I say oh I approximate, that would take ANY LENGTH OF TIME, it’s not short enough for fudders. So we find other ways to give a memecoin utility and ensure we get to a point through viral distribution that people don’t want to burn the token anymore.” He stressed the importance of enhancing SHIB’s utility through mechanisms like staking and developing new use cases for associated tokens such as BONE, LEASH, and Treat. The proposed burn of 99% of SHIB’s total supply would create extreme scarcity. Should demand remain stable or increase, the reduced supply could lead to a significant rise in the value of each remaining SHIB token. This shift has the potential to elevate SHIB from its current status as a low-cost meme token to a more valuable asset. However, Kusama clarified that such a burn would be a gradual process, driven by the adoption and integration of SHIB’s technology across various projects probably over several years, rather than an immediate reduction. As of press time, SHIB is attempting to breach the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00002823. This technical level is derived from the March 5 high of $0.00004567 and the local low of $0.00001067 observed on August 5. In the short-term, a successful breakout above the 0.5 Fib level could pave the way toward the 0.618 Fib target at $0.00003235.

It features a Shiba Inu from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply. New coins are mined every minute, making it plentiful. In 2021, its value surged, placing it among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap. This rise was influenced by social media and figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin's popularity shows the power of community and memes in finance. Its potential lies in strong community support and widespread recognition. Whether it is attractive in the current market depends on investor sentiment and market trends. Conclusion With the 2024 bull run underway, established coins like DOGE, Shiba Inu, and Pepe offer less short-term potential. Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale and triple utility features—governance, incentives, and staking—it aims to bring financial freedom to everyone. Join the fight against crypto villains today.

36834982,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27491,1732558547,Howard Lutnick to Leave Cantor Following Nomination as Trump’s Commerce Secretary,"Howard Lutnick to Retire from Cantor Amid Naming as Trump’s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the powerful chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, BGC Partners, and Newmark, announced today that he will retire once he is confirmed by the United States Senate, having been nominated by President-elect Donald J. Trump to serve as the United States Secretary of Commerce. The move represents a significant change in leadership for Cantor Fitzgerald, not least because Lutnick is handing some of the reins to his son, Brandon Lutnick. One of these includes a $2 billion lending program offering dollar loans collateralized by Bitcoin. The program underlines an increasingly important role for Cantor Fitzgerald in cryptocurrency markets-a trailblazer for new approaches to financial services. Cantor’s Expanding Crypto Ventures Tether is one part of Cantor Fitzgerald’s crypto strategy. The firm has been providing custody services for Tether’s U.S. Treasury holdings, earning hundreds of millions of dollars every year. The partnership epitomizes Cantor’s role of leadership in crypto-backed financial solutions and aligns with the greater focus on blockchain innovation. These operations are likely to be headed by Brandon Lutnick, a trader at Cantor who earlier worked at Tether. His management is likely to provide continuity to Cantor’s crypto initiatives and ensure the firm remains at the forefront of digital assets. Trump’s Emphasis on Financial Innovation Lutnick’s nomination reflects Trump’s emphasis on integrating financial innovation and digital assets into his administration. The President-elect has expressed strong support for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, signaling plans to establish a White House position dedicated to cryptocurrency policy. The appointment is part of a wider push by Trump to install a pro-business cabinet. Key appointments include Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services. These two combined show that Trump seeks to build an economy that is poised for growth and innovation. As Secretary of Commerce, Lutnick is likely to advance initiatives that will support traditional industries, as well as emerging ones such as blockchain and cryptocurrency. His guidance in this new position will be expected to fill the divide between government policy and private-sector progress. A New Chapter for Lutnick Howard Lutnick said he is honored for the nomination and because this is a great opportunity to work for economic advancement and technology innovation. His exit from Cantor Fitzgerald indeed marks the end of an era but brings in another new era, led by Brandon Lutnick. This move is indicative of an increasingly blurred line between mainstream finance and digital assets, setting up Cantor Fitzgerald—and the rest of the financial world—for further evolution.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/howard-lutnick-leave-following-nomination-trumps/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency. It was created by someone called Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin lets people send money directly to each other without banks. It uses blockchain technology, a public ledger kept by many computers worldwide. This means no single person controls it. To verify transactions, miners solve puzzles. They add new transactions to the blockchain and earn bitcoins. Every four years, the reward for miners is cut in half, called a ""halving"". This controls how many new bitcoins are made, up to 21 million. Bitcoin's technology could change how we use money. It allows value transfer without banks. In today's market, Bitcoin seems attractive to many investors. Its limited supply makes it like digital gold. As mining rewards decrease, bitcoins become scarcer. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is seen as more stable. While new coins appear and disappear, Bitcoin stays the leader. Recent trends show more interest from big companies and investors. This might increase Bitcoin's value in the future. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum, launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, has revolutionized the blockchain world. It's famous for introducing smart contracts and hosting a vast array of decentralized applications (dApps). These include decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, which make transactions faster and more efficient. In 2022, Ethereum shifted to a Proof-of-Stake system with the Merge, reducing energy use and setting the stage for future upgrades like sharding. This upcoming phase aims to make the network even more scalable and cost-effective. Ether (ETH) remains central, enabling transactions, rewarding those who help secure the network, and serving as a versatile asset. Looking at the current market, Ethereum shows promising potential. Predictions suggest that ETH could reach up to $6,580.53 next year, with a yearly low estimated at $2,700.31 for 2025, reflecting patterns seen in Bitcoin's halving cycles. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum stands out due to its continuous development and strong ecosystem. Its commitment to improving scalability and efficiency keeps it at the forefront of blockchain innovation. As the crypto market evolves, Ethereum's advancements suggest it remains a significant player, potentially offering interesting opportunities in the coming years. XRP (XRP) XRP is a digital currency designed for fast and low-cost transactions. It runs on the XRP Ledger, a system without a central authority. This means transactions are secure, irreversible, and don't need a bank account. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with 100 billion coins. Ripple, the company supporting XRP, was given 80 billion coins to help develop the ecosystem. They use XRP to improve network liquidity and have placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control its release. The name XRP comes from ""ripple credits,"" showing its goal to make transferring money across different currencies seamless. XRP's technology offers quick transactions and low fees, making it attractive for global payments. Unlike some other cryptocurrencies, XRP is built to handle large volumes fast. In the current market, XRP stands out due to its focus on real-world use, especially in cross-border payments. While coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum have their own strengths, XRP's speed and low costs give it an edge in certain areas. With growing interest in efficient global transactions, XRP could be poised for growth. However, like all cryptocurrencies, its future depends on market trends and adoption. Solana (SOL) Solana is making waves in the blockchain world. It's a platform designed for speed and scalability. Unlike some rivals like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana processes transactions quickly and efficiently. This makes it a strong foundation for decentralized applications, or dapps. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, is at the heart of this ecosystem. SOL powers transactions, runs programs, and rewards those who keep the network running smoothly. In the current market, SOL stands out as an attractive option. Its high-speed network appeals to developers wanting to build busy services without complex scaling solutions. While other platforms use methods like sharding to handle more traffic, Solana keeps it simple and powerful. This unique approach could draw more projects and investors. Compared to other coins, SOL offers a mix of speed and flexibility that might make it a promising player in the crypto space. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin began in 2013 as a joke, created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. They used a meme of a Shiba Inu dog for its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new Dogecoins are mined, and there's no maximum supply. What started as a ""memecoin"" quickly gained a following. In 2021, its value skyrocketed, soaring into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, with a total value over $50 billion. This surge was driven by social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, and the booming crypto market. Dogecoin's rise shows the power of community and the influence of social media on finance. So, is Dogecoin attractive now? Its popularity proves that a strong community can boost a coin's value. Dogecoin is easy to mine and trade, making it accessible. However, its unlimited supply could affect its long-term value. In the current market, many investors are looking at coins with unique technology or limited supply, like Bitcoin or Ethereum. But Dogecoin's charm lies in its simplicity and fun nature. If the community support continues, and influencers keep backing it, Dogecoin might still have room to grow. Comparing it to other coins, Dogecoin offers a lighthearted alternative in a complex crypto landscape. Conclusion BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL are solid choices, but XYZVerse (XYZ) pioneers as the first all-sport memecoin uniting fans and aims for significant growth through community-driven success.

36834955,https://blockworks.co/news/pumpdotfun-call-for-ban-or-regulation,1732557600,Pump.fun looks to self-regulate gory content,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Charlie Munger once said: “Show me the incentives and I’ll show you the outcome.” So if you’re launching a memecoin on pump.fun, your incentives are: reach a token market cap of $100k, upon which $17k of liquidity is deposited into the Raydium DEX to kickstart a trading pair. Then, here are the outcomes: nudity, stray gun shootings , threats of suicide , threats to harm pets , school children, family members and alleged stunts involving the consumption of faeces in a dog cage. This list just about sums up the banal grasps for attention in the world of memecoins. Thanks to pump.fun’s in-built livestream feature , that race for attention to the bottom is being laid bare on full display. Attention is the currency of memecoins, so it’s a somewhat unsurprising outcome. This state of affairs has sent a call for regulation or a ban on the memecoin launcher trending across Twitter. Already, there are fake images of a Polymarket predicting the odds of a pump.fun ban, and the SEC seizing the pump.fun website. Over the weekend, pump.fun founder Alon acknowledged the problem and claimed that the platform’s team of moderators are “working around the clock” to quash the “illicit content.” But given the rate of thousands of memecoins being deployed daily, that’s going to be easier said than done. Realistically speaking though, what could a regulator do? US regulators, for example, could pressure internet service providers to block the pump.fun DNS domain, but a VPN could easily skirt the ban. As for the tokens themselves, they live on the Solana blockchain. Regulators could technically pressure validators to block the transactions the same way the US Treasury applied sanctions on Tornado Cash in 2022, which takes us down the MEV supply chain rabbit hole once again. There’s an ironic parallel here to the longstanding problem facing Big Tech’s social media platforms. If illegal content is posted on Facebook, who should be held legally liable — the user or Facebook? Within the US, free speech proponents have argued that Section 230 of the 1934 Communications Act legally protects platforms’ illicit user-generated content. That logic, consistently applied, may shield pump.fun from regulatory pressure, though it will certainly not shield it from the forces of market competition. Pump.fun’s success has already been mimicked dozens of times. There is makenow.meme on Solana, sun.pump on Tron, and “ Clanker ,” a kind of AI-powered equivalent of pump.fun on Base, through which memecoins can be deployed into a Uniswap v3 pool for free with a Farcaster tweet. Clanker was launched slightly more than two weeks ago, and already has collected about $4 million in fee revenues, according to Farcaster co-founder Dan Romero. But whether it’s the regulatory hammer or market competition, pump.fun has plenty of incentives to quickly nip such a problem in the bud.

42416534,df9b792e-32f9-4089-b2a6-6b89d9839760,1732557523,Avalanche Blockchain's Largest-Ever Upgrade Goes Live on Testnet,"Avalanche, the eighth-largest blockchain by total value locked (TVL), is moving ahead with a major technical makeover.  The Avalanche9000 upgrade went live in a test network environment (testnet) Monday, bringing the changes one step closer to the main network (mainnet), the Avalanche Foundation said.  Avalanche9000 will be the largest upgrade that Avalanche has seen. It is designed to cut the costs of sending transactions, operating validators and building apps on the network, whose native token {{AVAX}} is the 11th-largest cryptocurrency, with a $16 billion market cap.  The foundation is trying to attract developers to Avalanche and encourage users to create customized blockchains using its technology, known as subnets. Somewhat confusingly, subnets are now officially referred to in the Avalanche community as ""L1s,"" even though they are roughly analogous to the layer-2, or L2, networks that augment Ethereum and other blockchains. (Avalanche's ""primary network,"" the equivalent of a layer-1 in other ecosystems, is considered a subnet.)  The team is hoping to bring Avalanche9000 to mainnet by yearend. Also known as the Etna Upgrade, Avalanche9000 consists of seven proposals, but the two most significant changes are ACP-77 and ACP-125.  Roll your own  The ACP-77 proposal would allow for a new type of validator with which users can launch their own subnets. The new validators will be significantly cheaper to operate, lowering the barrier to entry. The validators will also be permissionless, meaning anyone, from the operator of a decentralized exchange to the developers of another blockchain, can spin one up.  “Before this upgrade, it wasn't possible for a dYdX or Monad to use Avalanche to launch their own L1. And that was because all the chains were permissioned, and that was the only functionality that was available,” said Luigi D’Onorio Demeo, the chief operation officer of Ava Labs, the main developer firm behind Avalanche, in an interview with CoinDesk. “So after this upgrade, we can have a chain with thousands of validators that wasn't possible before.”  The ACP-125 proposal would lower the base fee, or minimum cost of running computations, on the primary Avalanche network’s C-chain, the main chain that runs smart contracts, from 25 nAVAX (about $0.00000098) to 1 nAVAX ($0.00000004.) One nAVAX equals one-billionth of one AVAX. (Avalanche also has a P-chain where users can stake AVAX and operate validators and an X-chain which is used for sending and receiving funds.)  “This basically puts C-chain fees equivalent to Arbitrum and Polygon,” D’Onorio Demio said, referring to two of the leading L2s on the Ethereum chain.  Referral grants  In addition to Avalanche9000 going live on testnet, the blockchain’s grants program, Retro9000, opened up Monday for developers to register and start building subnets in the testing environment. The foundation will reward them retroactively when they launch those subnets on mainnet.  “We'd love to see people experiment with different types of infrastructure like staking contracts. We'd love to see people experiment by building their own L1s,” D’Onorio Demio told CoinDesk. “If you're more in the market for building a chain, this is a great way to start.”  Retro9000 has $40 million in rewards to distribute, with $2 million designated for business development executives, influencer-investors (""key opinion leaders"") and the like who refer others to build on Avalanche.  “For the referral component: the idea there is if you're a KOL or a BD person, and you know people that are potentially viable to build this kind of stuff, they can list you as a referral. And you will be eligible to also receive parts of the $2 million as well in retroactive grants,” D’Onorio Demio said.

42416514,dd4923ad-e8e2-4bb1-a71a-c2fd1b6cab2c,1732557288,Bitcoin Buying Plans Are Supercharging Stocks. Is This a Michael Saylor Redux — or Another 'Long Island Iced Tea' Fad?,"What does the ragtag group including a fitness equipment maker, biopharmaceutical company and producer of battery materials have in common?    Bitcoin, of course.    As the cryptocurrency skyrockets to unheard-of levels this month, at least 12 publicly traded companies that previously had nothing to do with crypto announced they plan to buy bitcoin (BTC), choosing it as a modern — and, lately, quite profitable — place to park spare cash. It's a path illuminated by Michael Saylor's laser eyes since 2020, when he began converting his sleepy software maker MicroStrategy into a corporate vault for bitcoin.    That's turned MicroStrategy into a massive stock market success — up roughly 30 times in value since Saylor began buying bitcoin for the company, amassing a massive stockpile now worth about $38 billion. Just this month, its shares have nearly doubled in price since Donald Trump was elected U.S. president after pledging to embrace crypto. (Other crypto stocks have jumped, too. Coinbase, the exchange operator, is up nearly 70% since the day before the election.)    Others are trying to duplicate that success. On Friday, a biotech company, Anixa Biosciences (ANIX), said its board of directors approved buying an undisclosed amount of bitcoin to diversify the company's treasury reserves. The stock rallied as much as 19% but settled for a 5% advance by the end of the day. Meanwhile, on Thursday, fitness equipment company Interactive Strength (TRNR) said it plans to buy up to $5 million of bitcoin after its board approved the cryptocurrency as a treasury reserve asset. Following the announcement, its stock soared more than 80% at one point before settling for ""only"" a full-day gain of 11%.    Earlier last week, biopharma company Hoth Therapeutics (HOTH) announced a $1 million bitcoin buying plan, triggering an up to 25% surge in its stock — though nearly the entire rally fizzled by the end of the day. Similarly, companies including LQR House (LQR), Cosmos Health (COSM), Nano Labs (NA), Gaxos (GXAI), Solidion Technology (STI) and Genius Group (GNS) saw momentary spikes in their stock prices after revealing bitcoin treasury plans in November. Only one company fell after its announcement: Acurx Pharma (ACXP).    ""The recent bitcoin boom, coupled with MicroStrategy's 500+% stock surge in 2024, has inspired a wave of companies — particularly microcaps — to announce bitcoin buying strategies,"" said Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining (BTCM).    Whether these newcomers to the Saylor playbook will ever see Saylor-like benefits remains a very open question. ""This behavior could end the same way [as previous bull markets]: unsustainable hype followed by sharp corrections as the market realizes many of these announcements lack substance,"" Yang said.    And whether the recent entrants ever follow through is also technically unknown. So far, only artificial intelligence firm Genius Group is known to have actually bought any bitcoin.    But who can blame them for trying? Investors who invested early in MicroStrategy are getting ridiculously rich, and even recent investors are making easy money. Saylor largely funds MicroStrategy's bitcoin purchases with money raised from stock and debt sales. The copycats might gain access to capital markets that they wouldn't otherwise have had. Traders are following the old adage, ""Never fight the tape"" — meaning follow the market's direction no matter the fundamentals, while companies are providing what the market wants. Nobody wants to be ""that"" person or company telling their bosses, shareholders or anybody else that they underperformed the market because they didn't follow MicroStrategy's footsteps.    ""Only a few years ago, it was almost too risky to buy bitcoin. Now, however, the risk increasingly seems to be the opposite — not buying is actually the risk,"" said Brian D. Evans, the CEO and founder of BDE Ventures, adding that ""there’s real pain in not having exposure.""   To the hopefuls, this sudden corporate scramble might be a sign that mainstream bitcoin adoption is finally arriving, especially in an environment where President-elect Trump has said he wants the U.S. government to stockpile bitcoin, too.    ""For BTC proponents, the expectation is that a combination of macro factors such as inflation and new-found regulatory friendliness will spur further examples of the asset being placed on corporate balance sheets,"" Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial said in a report.    Also, a bitcoin buying strategy could open up capital markets for companies, like it did for MicroStrategy and miner MARA Digital (MARA). Both were able to raise money recently through convertible debt that pays no interest to investors, meaning those investors are willing to forego current income in exchange for the ability to eventually convert the debt to equity, thus gaining bitcoin exposure.    Saying they plan to buy bitcoin ""is a useful way for companies to raise capital, not unlike the way MicroStrategy has done over the last few years,"" said BDE's Evans.    However, to cynical ears, it all sounds a bit like the passing fad in the late 2010s that involved companies that previously had nothing to do with crypto adding the word ""Blockchain"" to their corporate name.    The most famous example of this was little-known beverage maker Long Island Iced Tea renaming itself Long Blockchain, with an explosive result, at least initially: Its share price nearly tripled in a single day after the crypto-rechristening. The gains didn't stick and the stock was later delisted by Nasdaq. (And three people were accused of insider trading by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.)    There have been other magic words. In the 2021 crypto bull market, big-name companies touted their Web3, metaverse and non-fungible token (NFT) initiatives — trying to hitch their shares to crypto and related hype. Facebook even changed its name to Meta to focus on the metaverse business, which subsequently faced massive losses. Meanwhile, companies with languishing share prices and no connection to crypto dipped their toes into bitcoin mining, a then extremely profitable business.    The brutal bear market that followed turned crypto terminology into dirty words that few wanted to use.    Though MicroStrategy has been able to raise billions from capital markets to fund bitcoin purchases, such a strategy, if pursued by others, could backfire for smaller companies, said Yang. ""For microcaps, it risks being seen as a short-term gimmick, deterring serious investors. If bitcoin's price stabilizes or declines, the stocks' speculative appeal may fade, leaving these firms vulnerable to investor skepticism and regulatory scrutiny.""    Echoing this sentiment, David Siemer, co-founder and CEO of Wave Digital Assets, said, ""While this approach may yield short-term gains in a bullish market, it carries significant risks. Unlike straightforward asset holding, leverage amplifies potential losses during market corrections, underscoring its inherent danger,"" he said, pointing to firms that are leveraging the hype around bitcoin to add debt to their balance sheet.    Regardless of who is right, with bitcoin repeatedly smashing all-time highs after Trump's U.S. election win, magic remains in the air: Announce a Saylor-like bitcoin plan and see your stock take off.    ""It’s almost as though we are at a point where a lot of companies feel compelled to do this,"" BDE's Evans said.

Could Ethereum Hit New ETH’s All-Time High above $4, 878 Ethereum is currently trading at $3,297, reflecting a -5% price decrease. Its open interest in futures has surged 11% to an all-time high of $20.27 billion, showing strong investor confidence. ETH’s average blob count per block recently exceeded 3, signaling higher transaction fees and potential deflationary pressure. The options market shows bullish sentiment, with most volumes concentrated around $3,200 and $3,500 strike prices, indicating expectations for ETH to surpass these levels by November 29. Institutional investors, however, are bearish, with Ethereum ETFs facing $30.3 million in net outflows on Wednesday, extending the outflow streak to $213.7 million. ETH has also seen $86.45 million in futures liquidations, with $37.13 million from long positions and $49.33 million from shorts. Ethereum is testing resistance at $3,397, and if it breaks this level, it could rally to $4,522. However, a close below $2,817 could signal a decline toward $2,250. ALGO Bullish Prediction 2024 ALGO has a bullish price prediction for 2024 and a better part of 2025. Holders are hoping for a target of $0.4077, depending on positive market momentum and investor sentiment. In contrast, if negative factors influence the market, the bearish prediction for ALGO is $0.1549. Currently, ALGO is priced at $0.259043, reflecting a 14.86% decrease. If market conditions remain favorable, ALGO could rise to $0.6. Looking further ahead, with continuous upgrades and developments within the Algorand ecosystem, there is potential for ALGO to surpass its all-time high (ATH) of $3.28, setting a new ATH in the future. These price predictions suggest significant volatility and highlight the cryptocurrency's potential for growth amid evolving market trends. Final Thoughts Ethereum and ALGO each offer compelling reasons for their growing popularity among heavy-weight investors and crypto whales.. However, $MASH is coming around with the most successful presale, improving its scalability to regulatory breakthroughs and ecosystem expansion. With the rapidly growing community, social activity, and MASH-Yields staking platform, $MASH is already curving a way to the top cryptocurrency.

It operates on a decentralized system without a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with 100 billion tokens, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple for ecosystem development. Ripple, initially known as OpenCoin Inc., uses XRP to improve network liquidity and has placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control supply release. XRP aims to facilitate seamless payment transfers across various currencies, making it a potential tool for global financial transactions. Its technology offers benefits for quick settlements and low fees in the digital finance landscape. Cardano (ADA): A Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications. Its cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and participate in the network through staking. Cardano uses a proof-of-stake mechanism called Ouroboros, which is energy-efficient compared to traditional proof-of-work systems. The platform is divided into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This design enhances its scalability, potentially processing up to 1,000,000 transactions per second. Cardano native tokens, introduced in March 2021, enable secure and low-fee interactions with smart contracts. The technology shows potential in the current market due to its sustainable approach and scalability features. Conclusion While coins like XRP and ADA have less short-term potential, DOGEN shines. Tailored for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN expects 700% growth by presale's end, with potential for thousand-fold returns. Following tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

42373320,0886a7c7-f92a-4dce-8473-6afab23d8f6d,1732554992,Mudslinging Sullies Prediction Markets Just as Sector's Prospects Brighten,"Kalshi may have tarnished its regulatory halo by slinging mud at a competitor.  Late Friday, Pirate Wires, a technology and culture publication owned by Founders Fund marketing executive Mike Solana, published a bombshell of a story. It documented how Kalshi, the U.S.-regulated prediction market, paid social media influencers to disparage crypto-based, offshore rival Polymarket and its CEO Shayne Coplan after the FBI raided Coplan's home this month.  Solana (no relation to the $120 billion cryptocurrency) disclosed up-front he had reasons to be biased and report what Kalshi allegedly did: Founder's Fund is an investor in Polymarket, and Pirate Wires has a paid partnership with Polymarket for ads, among other things.  Nevertheless, Solana wrote, ""receipts are receipts,"" and the screenshots in the Pirate Wires article paint a damning picture.  One screenshot showed Kalshi employees asking former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown to quote-tweet a post about Coplan with the comment, ""this [n-word] seem[s] guilty."" Brown obliged.  Another influencer, who regularly tweets Kalshi-related content, called  Coplan a ""lookalike"" of FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried, misleadingly implying that the former committed comparable crimes. (According to The New York Times, the raid was part of an ongoing investigation into whether Coplan ran an unlicensed commodities exchange; Bankman-Fried was convicted of fraud.)  Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour declined to comment when contacted by CoinDesk.  The Pirate Wires article caused an uproar on X. Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Investments, accused Kalshi, which has long touted its status as a regulated entity, of ""moral hypocrisy.""  Retaliation?  Someone — it's not clear who — apparently decided that what's good for the goose is good for the gander and launched a retaliatory smear campaign.  Shortly after Pirate Wires ran its piece, RawsAlerts, a news aggregator, posted on X that Kalshi is under investigation by ""multiple agencies,"" including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The post was awkwardly written (""allegations suggest …"") and did not cite any sources, even anonymous ones.  When contacted by CoinDesk, a spokesperson for the FTC declined to comment. There is no mention of Kalshi on its cases and proceedings page nor on its warning letters page.  Other accounts quickly echoed the ""Kalshi is being investigated"" narrative.  Polymarket flatly denied that it had anything to do with these posts: ""100% not us,"" a spokesperson said via email.  Big picture  In the tech industry, dirty tricks and smear campaigns are familiar territory. When Travis Kalanick ran Uber, it was notorious for using underhanded tactics against Lyft to make business difficult for the then up-and-coming competitor.  The Kalshi-Polymarket fracas comes at an otherwise fortuitous time for prediction markets.  Donald Trump's election victory vindicated the forecasting value of betting markets, which for most of the campaign showed him leading Kamala Harris while the polls indicated a toss-up.  Moreover, the incoming administration could create a more favorable regulatory environment. Trump campaigned as the first pro-crypto presidential candidate from a major party, and it's not hard to imagine his deregulatory agenda extending to prediction markets.  If it is true, as Polymarket claims, that the raid on Coplan's home was ""political retribution"" by the outgoing Biden administration for calling the election for Trump, the incoming administration might be inclined to drop the investigation.  Although it's not a crypto company, Kalshi too has chafed under regulatory supervision; it had to beat the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, led by Biden appointee Rostin Benham, in court before listing markets on the election.  Now on his way out, Benham has thrown in the towel on a proposed rule that would have banned election markets at all CFTC-supervised exchanges.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL,"Sam Reynolds, Marc Hochstein",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/25/mudslinging-sullies-prediction-markets-just-as-sectors-prospects-brighten,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00fd3d82e99eac16951466f56c349a9eea8e0fdd-1920x1519.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This has been due to the Bitcoin price, which has continued to fluctuate heavily in recent times. $500 Million Liquidated As Bitcoin Price Fluctuates Coinglass data shows that over $500 million was liquidated from the crypto market in the last 24 hours as the Bitcoin price fluctuates. Long traders suffered the most loss, with over $366 million in long positions liquidated. Meanwhile, over $129 million in short positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Dogecoin Extends Rally – Can This Lead To A Breakout Above $0.82? This came as the Bitcoin price dropped significantly from around $98,000 to as low as $95,500 on Sunday. Bitcoin has since recovered and is back again over $98,000. This heavy BTC price fluctuation has been the case since the flagship crypto came close to hitting the $100,000 milestone on November 23. The Bitcoin price has since witnessed major pullbacks followed by a sharp rebound, leading to mass liquidations as traders struggle to determine the future trajectory of the flagship crypto. These pullbacks have come as investors look to secure profits, seeing as the flagship crypto is approaching this psychological $100,000 price level. However, some whales remain undeterred as they recently bought $3.96 billion BTC in 96 hours. Notably, Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital bought 5,771 BTC ($572 million) at an average price of 95,554 per BTC. Although this Bitcoin price range might be the local top, the flagship crypto is still expected to go higher, which explains why these whales are still actively accumulating more BTC. Asset manager VanEck recently stated that $100,000 is only the beginning and predicted that Bitcoin could still reach as high as $180,000. Today Could Be The Day Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently predicted that today could be the day the Bitcoin price finally reaches the much-anticipated $100,000 milestone. This came as he revealed that the SuperTrend indicator had flipped bullish on the Bitcoin hourly chart as prices broke through the resistance trendline and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Related Reading: XRP Price Reaches 3-Year High At $1.6 – 2 Ways It Can Go From Here In another X post, Martinez suggested that $100,000 won’t be the cycle top for the Bitcoin price in this bull run. He stated that long-term Bitcoin holders are showing signs of growing greed. The analyst claimed that historically, this suggests that it could take 8-11 months for Bitcoin to hit a market top. If this historic trend continues, the Bitcoin price could peak between June and September 2025. Crypto analysts like Rekt Capital have also predicted that this period could mark the peak for Bitcoin in this bull run. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $98,300, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

36833108,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24487,1732553557,Why  Has MicroStrategy Become a Proxy For Bitcoin?,"MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin treasury strategy, initiated in 2020 under Michael Saylor’s leadership, has established the company as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with over 331,200 BTC valued at approximately $32 billion. The firm employs a combination of debt issuance, equity sales, and operational cash flows to finance its acquisitions, viewing Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a superior store of value compared to traditional assets. Beyond treasury diversification, MicroStrategy positions Bitcoin as digital gold and a transformative financial asset, aiming to align with the growing institutional adoption of digital currencies. MicroStrategy’s Stock is Mooning More than Bitcoin MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin treasury strategy has positioned the company as a pioneering corporate entity in digital asset investment. Beginning in 2020 under the leadership of co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor, the company adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, marking a significant shift in its financial strategy. This decision stemmed from a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a superior store of value compared to traditional assets like fiat currencies, which are susceptible to inflation and monetary debasement. Over time, MicroStrategy has accumulated over 386,700 Bitcoin , making it the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency, with holdings worth approximately $38 billion as of November 2024. To finance its Bitcoin acquisitions, MicroStrategy employs a combination of debt issuance, equity sales, and operational cash flows. The company has raised substantial capital through convertible senior notes and stock offerings, often issued at favourable terms due to strong investor demand. For instance, a recent $3 billion offering of 0 percent convertible senior notes highlights the firm’s ability to leverage traditional financial instruments to acquire Bitcoin. This approach allows MicroStrategy to continuously expand its Bitcoin reserves while maintaining liquidity for operational needs, demonstrating its commitment to a long-term Bitcoin-centric strategy. MicroStrategy’s objectives for accumulating Bitcoin extend beyond simply storing value. The company views Bitcoin as digital gold and a cornerstone of a transformative financial paradigm. By holding Bitcoin, MicroStrategy aims to hedge against inflation, diversify its treasury holdings, and align itself with the growing adoption of digital assets as a legitimate asset class. The firm also leverages its significant Bitcoin holdings to enhance its market valuation, attracting investors who view Bitcoin exposure as an essential component of modern investment portfolios. This dual focus on corporate financial health and digital asset innovation has redefined how businesses approach treasury management. Despite the volatility associated with Bitcoin, MicroStrategy’s aggressive accumulation strategy underscores its confidence in the cryptocurrency’s future. The firm’s actions have not only elevated its stock as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure but also contributed to broader institutional adoption of digital assets. However, this approach carries inherent risks, including potential losses during market downturns and increased scrutiny from regulators and investors. Nonetheless, MicroStrategy remains committed to its vision of integrating Bitcoin as a core component of its treasury assets, serving as a case study for corporations exploring the potential of digital currencies in their strategic planning. How Long Can Saylor’s “Infinite Money Glitch” Last For? MicroStrategy’s strategy of raising capital to acquire Bitcoin has often been referred to as a type of “ infinite money glitch ,” leveraging traditional financial mechanisms to accumulate the leading cryptocurrency in a self-reinforcing cycle. By issuing convertible debt and equity at favourable terms, MicroStrategy generates substantial funds, which it then uses to purchase Bitcoin. As the price of Bitcoin rises, the market perceives the company’s holdings as increasingly valuable, which inflates MicroStrategy’s stock price. This, in turn, enhances its ability to raise even more capital at attractive terms, allowing it to buy additional Bitcoin. The cycle repeats, creating what some describe as an almost perpetual growth loop tied to Bitcoin’s appreciation. The core of this mechanism lies in the speculative nature of both Bitcoin and MicroStrategy’s stock. Investors, eager for exposure to Bitcoin, often view MicroStrategy as a proxy for the cryptocurrency due to its massive holdings. This dynamic pushes the company’s stock to trade at a premium relative to the value of its Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy capitalises on this by issuing shares or convertible debt at inflated prices, effectively turning its elevated market valuation into a funding source. The proceeds are then funnelled into additional Bitcoin purchases, reinforcing the company’s position as a Bitcoin-centric enterprise and further driving the speculative cycle. However, this “glitch” is not without significant risks. The strategy hinges on Bitcoin’s long-term price appreciation and market confidence in MicroStrategy’s ability to manage its finances amid volatility. A sharp and sustained downturn in Bitcoin’s value could cause a dramatic decline in MicroStrategy’s stock price, reducing its capacity to raise funds and potentially leading to financial strain. With substantial debt obligations tied to its Bitcoin holdings, the company could face challenges meeting repayments without selling some of its Bitcoin reserves, which could exacerbate market declines. This cyclical risk underscores the precarious balance between leveraging financial innovation and maintaining operational stability. Despite these risks, MicroStrategy’s approach has sparked debate over its ingenuity and its reflection of broader trends in financial markets. Critics argue that this model resembles speculative leverage with systemic vulnerabilities, while supporters view it as a bold bet on the future of digital assets and an innovative use of corporate finance. By essentially converting traditional capital into Bitcoin in a way that amplifies its market position, MicroStrategy has exemplified how the intersection of traditional finance and cryptocurrency can lead to both unprecedented opportunities and complex challenges in managing risk. Bitcoiners Are Eyeing MicroStrategy Stock as an Additional Investment MicroStrategy’s stock performance has been closely tied to the trajectory of Bitcoin, making it one of the most volatile and scrutinised stocks in the market. During the current Bitcoin bull run, which has seen the cryptocurrency reach an all-time high of over $99,000 USD, MicroStrategy’s stock has surged dramatically, reflecting its role as a corporate proxy for Bitcoin. Investors have been drawn to MicroStrategy as a unique vehicle for gaining exposure to Bitcoin through traditional financial markets, contributing to its significant stock appreciation. However, this coupling has also amplified the stock’s volatility, with sharp swings often following Bitcoin’s price movements, demonstrating the inherent risks of this strategy. Bitcoin’s rise to nearly $100,000 has reignited excitement and optimism among investors, not only validating it as a digital asset but also emphasising its growing adoption and legitimacy. The increasing value of these Bitcoin holdings has significantly boosted MicroStrategy’s market valuation, making it a high-profile beneficiary of Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. This dynamic has positioned the company as a bellwether for institutional adoption of digital assets and a prime example of the integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial portfolios. Some investors view MicroStrategy’s stock as a de facto Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), particularly for regulated financial entities that are restricted from directly holding cryptocurrencies. By maintaining one of the largest corporate treasuries of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy offers a proxy investment for those seeking exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements within the framework of traditional financial markets. This positioning makes the stock an appealing option for institutional investors and funds that face compliance or regulatory barriers to holding digital assets directly. For these entities, MicroStrategy’s stock serves as a workaround, providing indirect exposure to Bitcoin while leveraging the oversight and structure of a publicly traded company, effectively functioning as an ETF in practice, if not in name. The phenomenon of “fear of missing out” has played a critical role in driving investor interest in both Bitcoin and MicroStrategy during this market cycle. As Bitcoin prices continue to climb, many investors who are wary of navigating the complexities of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges are turning to MicroStrategy as a more accessible alternative. The company’s stock offers a regulated, familiar avenue for gaining exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements, appealing particularly to institutional and retail investors who might otherwise hesitate to invest directly in the cryptocurrency. This surge of interest underscores the unique appeal of MicroStrategy as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto market. For MicroStrategy, the intersection of its stock performance and Bitcoin’s bull market highlights both opportunities and challenges. While the company benefits from the appreciation of its Bitcoin holdings, its reliance on the cryptocurrency also subjects it to heightened scrutiny and potential risks from regulatory and market volatility. Investors view MicroStrategy as a leveraged play on Bitcoin, which can magnify gains during bull markets but also exacerbate losses in downturns. The recent all-time high for Bitcoin underscores the growing convergence of traditional and digital assets, with MicroStrategy emerging as a key player in this transformative landscape. However, its continued success will depend on its ability to navigate the risks and opportunities of its bold strategy.

The company’s recent acquisitions have pushed its total Bitcoin holdings to approximately $38 billion. Convertible Notes Fuel Massive Bitcoin Purchase On November 25, co-founder Michael Saylor announced via social media that MicroStrategy had acquired 55,500 BTC between November 18 and November 24 for $5.4 billion. This purchase was funded by proceeds from a $3 billion convertible note issuance and sales of common shares, as detailed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Related Reading: XRP Price Builds a Base: Can Bulls Ignite a New Rally? Since beginning its Bitcoin acquisition strategy in 2020, Saylor has shifted from using corporate cash to a more complex funding model that involves selling convertible debt and shares. The latest convertible note was issued at a zero percent interest rate, reflecting lenders’ confidence that MicroStrategy’s stock will appreciate beyond the conversion price in the future. Jeffrey Park, a portfolio manager at Bitwise Asset Management, noted that Saylor has effectively leveraged financial arbitrage within the corporate treasury structure, allowing MicroStrategy to borrow funds at virtually no cost. Saylor also revealed that MicroStrategy’s treasury operations have yielded a substantial 59.3% in Bitcoin returns year-to-date, translating to a net gain of approximately 112,125 BTC for shareholders, or about 341 BTC per day. At a projected price of $100,000 per BTC, Saylor stated that this could mean an impressive $11.2 billion for the year, equating to roughly $34.1 million daily. Analyst Warns Of Risks In Leverage Strategy Since its foray into Bitcoin, MicroStrategy has acquired a total of 386,700 tokens, with an average purchase price significantly lower than its current market value. The latest acquisitions occurred while Bitcoin prices were nearing all-time highs, with the company purchasing the new tokens at approximately $97,862 each, slightly above their current trading price. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Bulls Stay in Control: Rally Far From Over? However, this leveraged strategy has raised concerns among some analysts, particularly after MicroStrategy’s shares (MSTR) fell by 16% last Thursday. Critics warn that if Bitcoin’s price declines sharply, the company’s stock could suffer similarly, recalling the downturn in 2022 when the cryptocurrency market experienced significant losses. TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza remarked on the risks associated with leverage, stating, “When you apply leverage to anything, you amplify the returns both in the up direction and in the down direction.” He emphasized that MicroStrategy is a pioneer in applying this leverage strategy specifically to Bitcoin. At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto is trading at $95,350, registering a price decrease of 1.7% in the 24-hour time frame.

The crypto market is experiencing a resurgence, with Bitcoin recovering strongly from a weekend dip. After briefly consolidating, Bitcoin rebounded from $95,000 to approach $99,000, sparking renewed optimism about its potential to surpass the $100,000 threshold.Amid these fluctuations, data from IntoTheBlock highlights pivotal factors influencing Bitcoin’s price action. The analysis reveals that 60,000 addresses accumulated approximately 22,740 BTC above the current price of $96,192.64. Meanwhile, significant market support exists below, with 458,000 addresses holding a combined 344,000 BTC. This clustering of strong support positions Bitcoin well for potential gains, according to the analysis. Immediate resistance at $98,490 is expected to be a temporary obstacle as Bitcoin continues its push toward the $100,000 threshold. IntoTheBlock data Chart analysis also shows strong market participation in the current price range. This is reflected by a large concentration of addresses that are either profiting or breaking even, which could help sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum.Bitcoin ETFs See Record InflowsIn addition, Bitcoin spot ETFs are continuing to play a major role in fueling market momentum. November has seen nearly $7 billion in net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, surpassing February’s record inflows of $6 billion. Since their inception, Bitcoin ETFs have only experienced one month of outflows, highlighting sustained investor interest.

Crypto investment products recorded a historic $3.13 billion in weekly inflows, the highest on record. U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs led the surge, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust attracting $2.32 billion. In contrast, European markets experienced $141 million in outflows, particularly in Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland.The demand for ETFs pushed Bitcoin to a new all-time high of $99,655, just shy of the $100,000 milestone. Analysts noted the rapid pace of Bitcoin ETF adoption, far surpassing the early performance of U.S. gold ETFs, which attracted only $309 million in their first year.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/25/data-shows-bitcoin-path-to-100k-strengthened-by-458k-addresses-holding-344k-btc/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=data-shows-bitcoin-path-to-100k-strengthened-by-458k-addresses-holding-344k-btc,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Despite facing profit-taking resistance near $99,334—its latest all-time high—BTC has demonstrated resilience, holding steady near $96,000 over the weekend, before regaining some strength in early Monday trading. With BTC now up 47 percent since the pre-election low of $66,880 and an astonishing 130 percent year-to-date, it is charting new territory. BTC outperformance compared to traditional assets is undeniable: Bitcoin has now eclipsed Saudi Aramco in market capitalisation, securing its place as the seventh-largest asset globally, with a valuation at its high that exceeds $1.9 trillion and has outperformed gold and silver , in relative terms this quarter. While Bitcoin’s rally has been remarkable, it has not come without profit-taking from long-term holders (LTHs). Over 461,000 BTC has been spent to date, following the break of the 73,666 ATH last month, as LTHs capitalise on gains far above their realised price of $24,912. While there is elevated distribution pressure, it remains contained compared to historical peaks in March 2021 and March 2024 . These movements suggest a healthy, yet temporary, stalling of momentum , with the broader market likely to absorb selling pressure and continue upward in the medium term. The broader cryptocurrency market, which excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum are known as the Total3 index, has also achieved new cycle highs, driven by surging investor sentiment. Total3 experienced a 23.2 percent trough-to-peak increase last week —the largest move since April 2021. Large-cap altcoins, such as Solana ( SOL ), reached new all-time highs, marking a pivotal moment as they surpassed key resistance levels, including the April 2022 high. Altcoin market capitalisation is now nearing its May 2021 peak of $984 billion, suggesting a shift in speculative capital from Bitcoin to altcoins. Historically, such rotations have signalled the onset of “alt season,” a period characterised by outsized gains in altcoins relative to Bitcoin. Indeed annualised funding rates for large-cap altcoins are moving past the 45 percent threshold, signifying heightened speculative activity . As retail participation grows, lower timeframe volatility is expected to increase, further fuelling altcoin momentum. However, these conditions call for caution, as extreme funding rates often precede sharp corrections. The US economic landscape is also currently shaped by mixed signals, with contrasting data across consumer sentiment, manufacturing activity, and the housing market, reflecting a blend of optimism and persistent challenges. Consumer sentiment rose in November to 71.8, driven by optimism among Republicans following Trump’s election, though longer-term inflation expectations climbed to 3.2 percent, reflecting concerns over his policies. Manufacturing activity softened, with the general activity index dropping to -5.5 , but positive trends in orders and employment and strong future growth expectations highlight resilience. The housing market faces significant challenges , with October declines in housing starts and permits due to high mortgage rates and hurricane disruptions, exacerbating the nationwide housing shortage. These trends reveal optimism in some areas but persistent structural challenges elsewhere. In crypto news last week, the SEC delayed its decision on Franklin Templeton’s proposed BTC-Ethereum combined ETF., despite approval being given for the introduction of BTC ETF options. Meanwhile, South Korea plans to implement a 20 percent cryptocurrency gains tax in 2025, but is raising the exemption threshold to 50 million won (~$35,919) to minimise the impact on small investors. Legislative votes are scheduled this month. And as mentioned, the Cboe will launch cash-settled options tied to spot Bitcoin on December 2, offering efficient tools for price exposure and risk management. These developments underscore the growing integration of crypto into mainstream finance. Happy Trading!

36830680,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27484,1732549503,South Korean FSC Shelves Bitcoin Reserve Plans Amid Domestic and Global Crypto Trends,"Prairie Fire for a Bitcoin Reserve The Financial Services Commission of South Korea has opted to delay plans to create a national Bitcoin reserve, amidst growing domestic clamor for its creation. Chairman Kim Byung-hwan discussed the matter in an interview with Newsprime on Nov. 24 where he called it “a bit of a distant story at the moment.” These calls picked momentum after the crypto-friendly policies of President-elect Donald Trump in the United States. Proponents believe a Bitcoin reserve would safeguard digital asset liquidity in South Korea, thereby guaranteeing financial stability as the crypto markets become increasingly active. U.S. Influence on South Korean Policies Kim lauded America’s proactive approach to cryptocurrency under Trump, describing it as an “active nurturing policy.” But Kim made a point to express that South Korea needs to consider the country’s particular regulatory and financial environment. “We will have to see what the U.S. does,” Kim said. “For now, the priority is how to connect this market to the existing financial system and establish a relationship with it.” His comments signal further caution from the FSC, which will be watching developments overseas rather than acting precipitously. Crypto vs. Traditional Markets Kim also raised concerns about the growing dominance of cryptocurrency trading volumes in South Korea, with virtual asset trading volume lately surpassing that of activity on the nation’s main stock market indices, KOSPI and KOSDAQ. “Funds should flow into traditional markets to support economic stability”, said Kim, warning of risks that may arise from the high volatility of cryptocurrencies to individual investors and to the greater financial system. Strengthening Crypto Regulations South Korea is actively trying to curb market volatility and unfair trade practices, including most recently the Democratic Party of Korea announcing a 20% cryptocurrency tax to be imposed in January 2025. This will be levied on profits above 50 million Korean won, or $35,668, per year. It had earlier proposed a threshold of 2.5 million won, about $1,800, before protests by major exchanges forced a revision. The revised tax plan reflects a balanced approach to fostering growth while ensuring market stability. Future Steps for South Korea As the global crypto landscape evolves, South Korea’s FSC remains cautious. While Bitcoin reserves are not part of immediate plans, the government is focused on integrating digital assets into its financial system and developing a robust regulatory framework. Balancing innovation with investor protection will be key as South Korea navigates its role in the global crypto economy.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/south-korean-shelves-bitcoin-reserve-plansdomestic/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

Despite bullishness on Bitcoin, MicroStrategy's premium on Bitcoin holdings is unjustified as there are no holding benefits for BTC in a corporate context. MicroStrategy's core software business is losing money and the company has heavily increased its share count in the last several years. The company’s aggressive capital raises and debt issuance dilute shareholder value, further increasing the investment risk. Investors now pay a significant premium to MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings that is simply not warranted or justified. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is a business intelligence company that has focused on assembling the largest corporate position of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in the world. While there were other companies that have invested money into Bitcoin -- such as Block ( SQ ) or Tesla ( TSLA ) -- MicroStrategy is by far the biggest owner of Bitcoin today with a stash of 279,420 Bitcoin (as of November 11, 2024). MicroStrategy’s market valuation has ballooned to ~$100B, mainly due to a steady stream of convertible notes offerings whose cash has been used for additional Bitcoin purchases. MicroStrategy is using its core business intelligence operations as a way to leverage up its balance sheet which makes the company at this point a directional bet on the Bitcoin price. However, investors buying MSTR pay an excessive premium to the actual Bitcoin price which makes MicroStrategy not only overvalued, but also potentially set for a massive correction if the Bitcoin price consolidates. Data by YCharts Previous rating and why my previous investment thesis didn't work out I rated shares of MicroStrategy a sell in March of this year -- A Bad Deal For Investors -- due to concerns about the company’s aggressive pace of convertible notes offerings. However, I have been heavily bullish on the price of Bitcoin in the last several years, so much so that I made the digital currency my largest portfolio position. Shares of MicroStrategy have soared since my last coverage, chiefly because of a surging Bitcoin price. The implied premium per Bitcoin is excessive, however, and I see signs of a bubble in MicroStrategy’s share price. What has changed my rating to strong sell is that the Bitcoin price has risen sharply, but MicroStrategy's share price has generated even stronger returns which indicates that investors are overvaluing the company's Bitcoin holdings. Given this discrepancy in the rate of price appreciation between MSTR and BTC, buying MSTR today reflects even higher risks than when I covered MicroStrategy eight months ago. Favorable changes in the regulatory landscape have boosted crypto investor sentiment There are a number of reasons why my investment thesis didn't unfold as expected, the number one reason being that a sustained rally in Bitcoin prices has allowed MicroStrategy to continue (and accelerate) its bitcoin-for-debt strategy. Bitcoin, as well as the broader cryptocurrency market, have also greatly benefited from the presidential election win of Donald Trump who has promised to become the ""first crypto president"" and which has benefited sentiment in the cryptocurrency market greatly. Additionally, a pro-Bitcoin regulatory environment is beginning to take shape, which included the resignation of SEC chairman Gary Gensler... a figure that is not held in high regard by the crypto-community due his crackdown on the industry. If Donald Trump follows through with his announcement to make the U.S. into the crypto capital of the world, the Bitcoin price may continue to rise, potentially even dramatically which obviously would benefit MicroStrategy. Due to these factors, Bitcoin successively reached new highs, allowing MicroStrategy's Bitcoin gamble to continue. As you can see in the chart below, the differential between the Bitcoin price and the share price of MicroStrategy has greatly expanded lately... indicating that a more serious bubble is brewing here than even six months ago. Data by YCharts MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings, investment strategy and capital raises MicroStrategy owned 252,220 Bitcoin as of October 29, 2024, which calculates to an average price of $39,266 per-Bitcoin. MicroStrategy has consistently acquired additional Bitcoin over time and has become the largest corporate owner of the digital currency in the world. In November, MicroStrategy raised another $2.1B through a capital offering in order to acquire another 27,200 BTC which brought the total Bitcoin holdings to 279,420 Bitcoin (at a new average price of $42,692 per Bitcoin. MicroStrategy With the Bitcoin price currently hovering just below $100,000, MicroStrategy’s valuation consists chiefly of unrealized capital gains. In fact, MicroStrategy’s unrealized Bitcoin investment gains current amount to ~$16B (based off of the data just provided). MicroStrategy, however, has widely outperformed the Bitcoin price in 2024, which raises questions about MSTR being in a bubble. MicroStrategy’s core software intelligence operations make up a small part of the company’s actual business (which now mainly consists of cryptocurrency investing). In the third-quarter, subscription billings amounted to $32.4M which showed an increase of 93% year-over-year, but in terms of total operating profit, MicroStrategy is not a very profitable company: it achieved non-GAAP operating income of only $0.9M in its core software business and revealed a total non-GAAP operating loss of $413.2M in the September quarter. MicroStrategy MicroStrategy has consistently lost money in its software operations this year: the company's total losses year-to-date, on a GAAP basis, amounted to $495.9M, yet the company has no problems issuing more convertible notes in order to buy more Bitcoin. MicroStrategy As part of MicroStrategy’s long-term capital allocation strategy, the company revealed in the third quarter that it was planning to raise a stunning $42B in capital (both equity and debt) in the next three years in order to further accumulate Bitcoin. Since the company currently has a market cap of $95B, MicroStrategy is poised to expand its market value, purely based off of capital raises, by 44% in the next three years. Since MicroStrategy has pursued aggressive actions in terms of raising capital in the last two years, this target of $42B could well be exceeded going forward. MicroStrategy Most recently (November 21, 2024), MicroStrategy raised another $3B in convertible senior notes due 2029, with a 0% interest rate, with an implied conversion rate of 1.4872 shares. This in turn implies an initial conversion price of approximately $672.40 per-share. Going forward, investors must expect more capital raises (both debt and equity) which is going to dilute shareholders. The amount of shares outstanding has increased by more than 500% in the last three years which poses significant dilution for investors. With the amount of shares surging recently, there is also a natural limit as to how much equity a company can sell going forward. Data by YCharts Sustained Bitcoin run could allow MSTR to continue to out-perform Since MicroStrategy's share price, given its large holding in Bitcoin, can now be expected to move in tandem with the Bitcoin price, the company's bitcoin-for-debt strategy could work in the short term, though I would still question the size of the premium investors are paying for shares of MicroStrategy (see next section). MicroStrategy is basically issuing 0% convertible debt, which means the company's bottom line is not affected by its debt raises. In the short term, this strategy could pay off, especially if the Bitcoin price continues to rise. The strategy may also work for MicroStrategy if the company decided to scale back its Bitcoin purchases (unlikely, in my opinion) or decided to monetize its Bitcoin stake... thereby turning unrealized profits into real ones. Since MicroStrategy seems to have taken a long view on owning Bitcoin, I don't expect the company to take a kind of trading approach to its Bitcoin holdings. If the Bitcoin price therefore continues to rally, MicroStrategy could be a big beneficiary and even overvalued shares can remain overvalued for a long time. Details about an emerging, pro-crypto regulatory landscape would likely also help MicroStrategy continue its strong run, although I would still not be comfortable paying MSTR's excessive, implied BTC premium. MicroStrategy is in a bubble and investors don't need to pay a premium for owning BTC Since MicroStrategy owns so many Bitcoins and since the business intelligence business now represents a relatively small part of the company’s valuation, MicroStrategy is now effectively a directional bet on the Bitcoin price. I believe the company is best valued by directly comparing its market valuation with the total value of the company's Bitcoin holdings. Cloud and software intelligence companies often trade at high revenue multipliers, largely because their top-line potential is attractive to investors. Platform businesses also offer investors significant scale benefits, leading to investors valuing their potential for super-charged growth. Microsoft ( MSFT ) or Salesforce ( CRM ), to use just two examples that own cloud-based software platforms, have current year price-to-revenue ratios of 12X and 10X. If we were to apply the average of 11X to MicroStrategy’s software business, which has ~$460M in expected FY 2024 revenue, we would arrive at a valuation of approximately $5.1B. The remaining ~$95B of MicroStrategy's market value therefore reflects the company’s holdings of a total 279,420 Bitcoins. The total implied value per Bitcoin is therefore ~$339,990 which compares to an actual Bitcoin price of $99,000 today. In other words, investors currently pay a massive 243% premium for MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings, although they could simply buy Bitcoin themselves on any cryptocurrency platform of their choice. I don’t see a specific reason why owning Bitcoin through a corporation is in any way more useful or valuable for investors compared to owning Bitcoin outright, especially considering that investors buying Bitcoin directly don't have to pay a premium for BTC. The fact that MicroStrategy's share price performance (+568% YTD) has also fundamentally decoupled from the Bitcoin price performance (+134% YTD) is further evidence that shares of MicroStrategy are in a bubble. Risks with MicroStrategy There are a number of risks with MicroStrategy. The first one is that the company is not primarily a business intelligence company anymore, but rather a corporate vehicle to own Bitcoin. Given the high amount of Bitcoin the company owns on its balance sheet, MicroStrategy’s stock is more a proxy on the Bitcoin price and will likely be subjected to considerable volatility. Second, MicroStrategy is issuing so much debt and equity that investors are seeing some serious dilution which erodes their stakes in the company. Third, MicroStrategy's bitcoin gamble has a natural limit which occurs when investors are no longer willing to fund the company's operating losses or new debt offerings. Final thoughts While I am super-bullish on Bitcoin in the long term, there are no scale benefits of owning the digital currency through a corporation and therefore there is no need whatsoever for investors to pay a premium for a corporate-owned Bitcoin stash, certainly not one that is as high as 243%. Bitcoins are limited in supply, which may result in the price of the currency increasing going forward. Investors that want to buy Bitcoin in order to partake in the growth of the cryptocurrency can buy BTC directly. I believe MicroStrategy's aggressive bitcoin gamble has pushed shares into bubble territory and MSTR is highly vulnerable to even a slight pullback in the Bitcoin price.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740079-microstrategy-dangerous-gamble-rating-downgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36830356.jpeg

As the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has consistently broken all-time highs over the past three weeks, with yesterday marking a milestone weekly close at $98,000—the highest in its history. Related Reading: XRP Analyst Sets $2 Target If It Holds Key Level – Can It Reach Multi-Year Highs? CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler shared an insightful analysis on X, emphasizing that Bitcoin’s recent attempt to dip below $95,000 met with significant resistance, reinforcing the strength of current support levels. According to Adler, the market is now poised for a critical test of the $100,000 mark, a barrier that could catalyze further bullish momentum or signal a short-term consolidation phase. With Bitcoin’s bullish trajectory showing no signs of slowing, traders and investors are closely watching for a breakout above $100,000. Such a move could ignite broader market optimism and drive renewed interest in altcoins, potentially shaping the next phase of the crypto market’s growth. However, failure to break above this key level might trigger a healthy correction, setting the stage for a more sustainable rally. Bitcoin Price Action Remains Strong Bitcoin’s price action has remained exceptionally bullish despite a recent retrace from $99,800 to $95,800—a minor dip of less than 4%. Investors widely see this pullback as a brief consolidation phase before a potential breakout above the pivotal $100,000 mark. The resilience demonstrated during this retrace has bolstered confidence among market participants, with many viewing it as a healthy pause in an ongoing uptrend. Renowned CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler weighed in on the recent market movements via X, sharing a technical analysis that reinforces Bitcoin’s robust bullish structure. Adler highlighted that pushing BTC to lower demand levels was unsuccessful, further solidifying current support zones. According to his insights, the stage is now set for Bitcoin to finally test the critical $100,000 area and gauge the market’s reaction at this psychological threshold. As BTC approaches this milestone, investor sentiment appears divided. Many traders view the $100,000 level as an ideal price to begin taking profits, citing historical patterns of pullbacks after significant round-number milestones. Related Reading: Avalanche Soars 20% In 24 Hours – Analyst Reveals Next Price Target However, others remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s continued strength, forecasting a potential surge beyond $100,000. Predictions for the rally’s peak range between $105,000 and $120,000, reflecting a broader belief in the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. Whether Bitcoin consolidates or continues climbing, all eyes remain on its next moves. Bullish Weekly Close Could Send BTC Higher Bitcoin has achieved its highest weekly close in history, recording an impressive $98,000. This milestone is a technical achievement and a critical psychological boost for market participants. It signals a strong bullish environment that could soon propel Bitcoin above the coveted $100,000 mark. The $98,000 level now serves as a robust support zone, and maintaining this price—or at least staying above $95,000—in the coming days will be pivotal. A breakout above these levels could propel Bitcoin towards $100,000 with significant momentum. Such a move would solidify Bitcoin’s uptrend and attract further interest from retail and institutional investors.

Its capacity for instilling trust and transparency appeals to many. With industries leaping aboard, let's dive into the essence of this potent tool and its standout attributes. What Is Blockchain? Blockchain is a game-changer. It's a decentralised digital ledger that ensures transactions stay secure and transparent. I appreciate its power to eliminate intermediaries, empowering direct exchanges. Transactions get validated by a distributed network, ensuring reliability. This scrupulous record-keeping stands out in today's digital world. Key Features of Blockchain Decentralisation excites me. It means no single entity wields control. Blockchain'simmutable ledger assures transactions can't be altered or deleted, fostering trust. Each node updates the ledger, enhancing consistency. The system's robust security is crucial, reducing single-point failures and offering peace of mind. Benefits Over Traditional Systems Blockchain offers distinct advantages. I've noticed its transparency adds direct oversight, enhancing trust. Without intermediaries, processes get streamlined, reducing costs. Its security protects against fraud, a welcome feature. The technology fosters a reliable and interconnected framework, ideal for modern needs. Exploring Early Blockchain Technology Adoption Initial Use Cases and Industries Finance and banking grabbed my attention when they started using blockchainfor faster, more secure transactions. Institutions like Wells Fargo and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia made cross-border transactions smoother. Supply chain management also piqued my interest. Blockchain improved transparency and traceability, which assured product authenticity, essential for trust. IT sectors explored blockchain for supply chain and workflow efficiency. It also helped secure data and protect intellectual property. Challenges Faced in Early Adoption I saw several challenges with blockchain's early adoption. Integrating this complex technology into existing systems required significant investment and technical expertise. Many companies faced regulatory hurdles. Compliance with laws varied across regions, complicating adoption efforts. Blockchain's scalability was an issue I noticed. Processing vast transaction volumes remained a technical challenge. Businesses had to manage privacy concerns, finding a balance between transparency and data protection. Lessons Learned from Early Implementations I noticed early blockchain projects provided valuable insights. Companies realised the importance of collaboration with regulatory bodies to ease compliance issues. They learned aligning blockchain with business goals streamlined adoption. Addressing scalability involved innovations in protocol design and infrastructure. Companies prioritised security and robust testing of blockchain solutions. Adaptability emerged as a key lesson. Businesses willing to innovate and adapt found greater success in this evolving landscape. Investigating Current Adoption Trends in Blockchain Blockchain's impact spans multiple sectors, driving transformative innovation. I've seen firsthand how diverse industries are capitalising on this promising technology. In doing so, they're setting new standards and unlocking unprecedented efficiencies. Popular Industries Embracing Blockchain Financial services lead the way, leveraging blockchain for secure transactions. I've noted that healthcare is rapidly integrating it for secure data sharing. In logistics, this tech streamlines operations and boosts transparency. Even gaming adopts blockchain to verify virtual assets, ensuring player trust. Innovations Driving Blockchain Growth Smart contracts simplify processes. I've witnessed their efficiency in automating agreements without intermediaries. Tokenisation transforms asset management, offering fractional ownership. Blockchain-based digital identities enhance security. These innovations drive increased blockchain adoption. Case Studies of Successful Implementations Walmart uses blockchain to track food supply chains, enhancing safety. I find this especially groundbreaking. IBM's collaboration with shipping giants optimiseslogistics. In healthcare, the Mayo Clinic improves data accuracy with blockchain. Each case highlights real-world blockchain benefits. Identifying Barriers to Widespread BlockchainAdoption Blockchain holds immense promise. However, several roadblocks hinder its universal acceptance. Let's delve into the primary barriers that continue to challenge this transformative technology. Technical Challenges and Limitations Scalability issues are a major hindrance to blockchain adoption. Networks struggle to process high transaction volumes. This limitation is problematic for applications requiring rapid processing. In my experience, this challenge stifles innovation. Interoperability is another concern. Different networks cannot always communicate seamlessly. This hinders efficient data exchange—an issue I've often encountered in collaborative projects. Additionally, blockchain'sperformance is under scrutiny. Slow transaction speeds and high energy requirements, especially with proof-of-work algorithms, are concerning. These technical barriers must be addressed for widespread adoption. Regulatory and Legal Hurdles Regulatory hurdles present significant challenges. Government policies on blockchain differ across regions. This variability creates uncertainty for businesses and investors. I've observed companies hesitating due to unclear regulations. Legal frameworks are often slow to evolve. This gap can hinder the adoption of new technologies. Businesses must navigate complex legal landscapes, which can be daunting. Intellectual property rights are another concern. Protecting innovations while using blockchain technology remains tricky.These legal complexities must be resolved. A unified regulatory framework would boost confidence in blockchain's stability. Public Perception and Trust Issues Public perception is crucial for blockchain adoption. Many still associate it with cryptocurrency scams. This skepticism creates a trust gap. I've noticed that transparency can strengthen public trust. Educating people about blockchain'spotential benefits is essential. However, misinformation persists. It's challenging to change entrenched perceptions. Privacy concerns also affect public trust. Users fear breaches of sensitive data. As someone who's seen blockchain'stransformative power, I believe providing clear information and robust security measures can enhance trust and drive adoption. Future Outlook for Blockchain Technology Adoption Emerging Use Cases and Opportunities I'm excited by blockchain's potential in sustainability. It's already making strides in secure, transparent supply chains. Renewable energy markets benefit from its efficiency. Decentralised finance also excites me, so it transforms traditional lending. Its tech-savvy approach opens doors to more inclusive, accessible financial services. I see room for innovation in healthcare, ensuring data accuracy and patient privacy. Predictions for Industry Growth I believe the future of blockchain in banking's bright. Increased resilience and security will drive adoption. With financial sectors like ICT, banking, and consulting leading, growth looks promising. Adoption rates between 3.50% and 4.50% hint at strong potential. The demand for secure digital transactions will propel its usage. Businesses will seek blockchain to streamline operations and boost trust. Its cross-industry appeal ensures continued expansion and innovation. Strategic Recommendations for Adoption I suggest focusing on clear legislation to help blockchain thrive. Engage users by prioritising privacy and security. Collaborate with agencies for smoother integration. Align initiatives with business goals for success. Invest in research and development to overcome challenges. When firms embrace challenges, they'll unlock blockchain value. Adaptability's key in tapping into its transformative potential. I encourage adopting flexible strategies that accommodate rapid change. Conclusion Blockchain technology is undoubtedly a game-changer with the potential to redefine industries and create new opportunities. As we navigate this rapidly evolving landscape, it's clear that embracing blockchain requires a strategic approach, balancing innovation with practicality. The lessons from early adopters highlight the importance of collaboration and adaptation. By addressing current barriers and fostering trust through education and transparency, we can unlock blockchain's full potential. The future looks promising for those who are ready to harness this technology's transformative power and drive meaningful change across sectors.

42388843,1b75cd06-f66e-4896-8710-41c53885e7bd,1732548512,Tornado of Administrative Overreach: Challenging Sanctions of Crypto Mixing Services,"Cryptocurrency transactions are often anonymous, but they’re not private. In fact, they’re quite public. Anyone with the right technical know-how can see every transaction ever made on most publicly accessible blockchains.    This radical transparency and traceability has made it easier (contrary to popular belief) for law enforcement to track stolen and laundered cryptocurrency across various transactions. But it has also made it easier for criminal crypto actors to trace certain transactions, and — by collecting enough data points — recognize the real-world identity of crypto users who would otherwise remain anonymous.    Dramatic stories abound about violent home invasions targeting those with large cryptocurrency holdings or hackers targeting those who donate to controversial causes. More mundanely, those who accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods or services might not want the person paying them to know their entire on-chain financial history with only a few clicks.    Recognizing these realities, crypto-mixing services sprung to life. The technical details can differ dramatically, but essentially these services act as intermediaries, mixing together crypto transactions to make them more difficult, if not impossible, to track. Some mixing services actually take custody of the cryptocurrency, mix the funds together, and then distribute them to pre-determined places. Others rely instead on smart contracts (pre-written computer code) to do this for them. Created in 2019, popular crypto-mixing service Tornado Cash falls into this latter category.    For the same reasons these services appeal to legitimate users (privacy and making transactions harder to track), they also appeal to criminals and hostile foreign state actors such as North Korea. Knowing this, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions that would prohibit “U.S. persons” from engaging in transactions with, or using, some of these mixing services, including Tornado Cash.    But does OFAC have the authority to do this, particularly when it comes to smart-contract-based services such as Tornado Cash?    In two similar lawsuits — one pending in the Fifth Circuit and one pending in the Eleventh Circuit — a series of plaintiffs are arguing that it does not, saying that OFAC’s decision involves “an unprecedented exercise of [its] authority.” To understand why, we need to back up and understand precisely what Congress has said.    For starters, it makes sense that Americans wouldn’t want criminals or foreign adversaries using the U.S. financial system to accomplish their nefarious goals. So, Congress empowered the president to use a panoply of broad economic tools to stop them from doing so. The president in turn delegated his authority to impose and exercise these economic sanctions to the Secretary of the Treasury who in turn delegated much of the responsibility to OFAC for implementing them.    As relevant here, Congress passed two laws that authorize the president and those to whom he has delegated authority, to act. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) empowers the chief executive (who has delegated his authority all the way down to OFAC) to block “any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest” when certain other specified conditions are met. Another act, the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, allows the president to sanction the “property and interest in property” of “any person” who engaged in specified conduct.    While national security concerns pervade the cases challenging OFAC’s actions, fundamentally the cases are about statutory interpretation. What do the terms “person,” “property,” and “interest in property” mean in plain English so that courts can decide whether Congress gave the President — and OFAC — the power to impose sanctions on Tornado Cash?    In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Loper Bright decision, courts must decide for themselves what these terms mean without giving deference to the agency’s interpretation.    Of course, the plaintiffs in these lawsuits argue that these aren’t obscure technical terms. And they argue that “text, precedent, and history” support their position that OFAC exceeded its authority in placing the Tornado Cash entity it designated on the sanctions list — largely because of how Tornado Cash operates and is structured.    They argue, essentially, that OFAC didn’t properly identify any person — which can include an entity (though they argue there isn’t one in this case) — didn’t properly identify any property because the open-source immutable smart contracts (computer code) at issue here aren’t capable of being owned, and didn’t properly identify any interest in property, as traditionally understood to mean a “legal or equitable claim to or right in property.”    In part, this stems from the fact that there’s confusion over what exactly constitutes “Tornado Cash.” While the government referred to an amalgamation of entities and individuals, the plaintiffs say that “[n]obody besides the government call these people ‘Tornado Cash’” and others instead typically use Tornado Cash to refer to the smart contracts underlying the mixing service.    Essentially, there’s the (Ethereum) blockchain on which the smart contracts run , the developers who initially programmed the smart contracts, the smart contracts themselves, and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that has many members that vote and takes actions related to the smart contracts but that doesn’t own or control the smart contracts themselves since they are unchangeable open-source software code.    The plaintiffs say that by allowing OFAC to break free from the traditional widely accepted understanding of “person,” “property,” and “interest in property,” OFAC’s “sanctions authority would be nearly limitless.” The plaintiffs say that if OFAC’s sanctions are allowed to stand, “every American citizen may be prohibited from executing those lines of code to make political donations, start business ventures, or develop new software features.” They also make clear that OFAC “cannot ban Americans from transacting only with fellow Americans or with their own property,” yet they say that’s exactly what has happened here.    Both district courts considering these issues disagreed and found that OFAC had acted lawfully in imposing the sanctions. At a recent oral argument in the Fifth Circuit case, however, the appellate judges seemed skeptical. And the appellate judges in the Eleventh Circuit case asked tough questions too.    Due process and First Amendment concerns have been brought up in varying degrees in both cases. There’s also questions about what role, if any, the rule of lenity and the Major Questions Doctrine should play. And, even more to the point, there’s questions with larger implications for the crypto community such as whether a smart contract (computer code) can be a unilateral contract and whether a DAO standing alone can be thought of as an unincorporated association or even a general partnership with liability for some or all of its members.    With all of these lingering questions, one thing is clear: Congress should be the entity to respond to the changing circumstances brought about by new technology rather than an administrative agency such as OFAC. Current law shouldn’t be stretched in new and novel ways beyond its proper bounds to fit new circumstances.    On that much, we should all agree.

36837382,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102636,1732548434,Here’s Dogecoin Price if Bitcoin Hits $1M as Predicted by Bernstein,"Dogecoin exhibits promising potential in a market where Bitcoin trades in the $1 million price range. In the past few weeks, Dogecoin has effectively capitalized on Bitcoin’s momentum in the ongoing bull market. At press time, Dogecoin is trading above $0.42 following a 213% price surge over the last four weeks.Meanwhile, Bitcoin's value has advanced by 45% during this time, hovering around $97,000. With Bitcoin expected to crack the $100,000 mark in the coming days and potentially rise to even loftier price ranges, market participants, particularly retail investors, are increasingly taking positions in Dogecoin to benefit from the buoyant market.One of the most ambitious price points forecasted for Bitcoin is the $1 million range, as predicted by several industry pundits, including Bernstein.Now, The Crypto Basic examines the potential price outlook for Dogecoin if Bitcoin reaches $1 million, as widely forecasted.Industry Forecast for Bitcoin Reaching $1MIn June, Bernstein predicted that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2033, with a peak of $200,000 by 2025. This prediction was part of a research report on MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin.Similarly, financial author Robert Kiyosaki has argued that Bitcoin could reach $1 million before the end of this decade.Notably, Bitcoin is currently trading at $97,100. Reaching $1 million would require the asset to increase by 930%, or 10-fold. At this price, Bitcoin would have a cap of approximately $20 trillion, which significantly exceeds the current valuation of gold. Essentially, at $1 million per coin, Bitcoin could become the most valuable asset in the world.With this feat, the altcoin market stands to benefit significantly. Specifically, if Bitcoin alone reaches a market cap of $20 trillion, the altcoin market could be valued similarly, potentially pushing the overall crypto market to around $40 trillion.Dogecoin Price if Bitcoin Hits $1MEstimating Dogecoin's precise value if Bitcoin reaches $1 million is challenging. However, assuming proportional price growth alongside Bitcoin’s, a 930% increase from Dogecoin’s current value of $0.4250 would raise its price to around $4.38. While this is a rough estimation, it likely underestimates Dogecoin’s potential in a market where Bitcoin is worth $1 million.Some market analysts believe that even a $10 price for Dogecoin is possible in the current market season, let alone by 2033, when Bitcoin is expected to reach $1 million. Furthermore, Dogecoin has historically outperformed Bitcoin by a significant margin. For example, Bitcoin has risen by 131% in the past year, while Dogecoin has surged by 380% during the same period.This suggests that rather than merely mirroring Bitcoin’s 930% growth to $1 million, Dogecoin could experience growth at a rate four times that, potentially bringing its price to nearly $20.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/25/heres-dogecoin-price-if-bitcoin-hits-1m-as-predicted-by-bernstein/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-dogecoin-price-if-bitcoin-hits-1m-as-predicted-by-bernstein,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Bonk price is up around 250% on YTD numbers, while Shiba Inu is running amok at 160%. But the problem with meme coins is that they never last, as they have nothing to support them. The crash is inevitable. Long-term investors prefer tokens with less volatility that can stand the test of time, and right now, Lunex Network ticks all the boxes to be the next big crypto. Lunex Network (LNEX): The next big crypto making it big in presale Lunex Network is a new hybrid exchange redefining what it means to be a crypto trader. Crypto has evolved, but crypto trading hasn’t. Cross-chain trading is still a technical roadblock, slippages are an issue, and fees can take larger chunks out of profits, not to mention custodial wallets that pose a security risk. Until now! Lunex Network offers crypto traders over 50,00 trading pairs across multiple chains, minimizes slippage, and offers non-custodial wallets for extra security. As for fees, LunexNetwork operates a zero-fee environment to make sure your profits are where they belong: in your wallet. For investors searching for the next big crypto, Lunex Network delivers the perfect combination of accessibility, scalability, and long-term potential. Bonk (BONK): Bonk price is inspirational, but will it last? At around 250% for the year so far, of which 120% was in the last month alone, the Bonk price indicates just how well meme coins are doing right now. Built on the Solana chain. Bonk is a relatively new entrant in the meme coin family. It is not coincidental that Bonk is doing well partly due to Solana’s prodigious rise. It was the next big crypto a year ago, and those who got in early were rewarded with spectacular profits. Meme coins are little miracles of modern marketing. The bulk of them have nothing to support them. They have zero intrinsic value yet are literally the best-performing assets the world has ever seen. The only problem is that as soon as the bull run is over and the marketing has dried up, meme coins will crash, and the Bonk price will tend to zero again. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The pattern continues Shiba Inu is up 160% in YTD numbers, but this does not tell the whole story. Shiba Inu is still trading at 70% below its ATH, which it achieved in 2021. Shiba Inu is perhaps the stereotypical meme coin: massive rise with a huge fall, leaving only the very first early adopters not losing their shirts. A massive chunk of Shiba Inu’s year-to-date numbers is a result of the February spike, and Shiba Inu is down 20% from its 2024 high in February. Yes, Meme coins can make money, but the secret is in the timing. It’s better to invest in tokens with fundamentals that can keep performing for years without the massive spikes and plummets that meme coins are famous for. Conclusion Meme coins are great, but one needs to be clever or lucky to profit from them. The Bonk price is excellent, and Shiba Inu has made many millionaires, but it’s a function of timing. The next big crypto will have short-term gains and long-term sustainability. This is why the next big crypto is Lunex Network, currently available at $0.0031 during presale.

36837380,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102740,1732547820,Top Analysts Say Those Planning to Sell Bitcoin at $100K Will Regret It,"Top analysts warn that those planning to sell Bitcoin at $100K may regret it, predicting the asset will surpass this milestone and reach even higher levels. Since Bitcoin broke the $90K level 12 days ago, it has largely remained in a holding pattern. But traders and market participants eagerly await its entry into the $100K range.Last week, Bitcoin came within striking distance of $100K. Specifically, the asset entered the $99K range last Thursday and even rallied up to $99,600 the next day but has seen no further progress since then. BTC maintained a tight range between $97K and $99K for most of the weekend. While a dip to $95K occurred, it is back in the $98K range at press time.In this latest Bitcoin news , Prominent market commentators, like analyst Rekt Capital, have attributed the stall to major resistance around the lofty $100K price point. He noted that Bitcoin is facing rejection at $100K, as some crypto traders believe selling Bitcoin at $100K is a good idea.With the $100K zone seeing unprecedented interest from crypto enthusiasts and the global financial market, some investors think it is a good point to take profits and exit the market. As a result, Bitcoin keeps flirting with $100K rather than breaking into that range.Bitcoin Sellers at $100K Will Regret Their MoveHowever, Rekt Capital expressed confidence that those who think selling at $100K is a good idea will not hold that belief for long. He suggested the asset will ultimately surpass the $100K mark, and those who sell now may come to regret their decision.Other market participants share a similar view. Paolo confidently stated that sellers offloading Bitcoin at $100K will eventually tell their grandkids about the worst financial decision they ever made, much like those who sold at $1,000, $10,000, and $20,000 before them.Other commenters, like Erwin, remarked, ""$100K is a magnet and will soon be broken.”Veteran market watchers, like Peter Brandt, have also weighed in on Bitcoin's widespread perception around the $100,000 mark. Brandt noted that this situation reflects a form of conventional wisdom—where the majority of market participants believe Bitcoin will peak at $100,000.However, he pointed out that when conventional wisdom becomes deeply entrenched, it often signals the opposite trend, as widely held beliefs tend to be wrong in the long run. Essentially, Brandt sees higher levels for Bitcoin beyond $100K. $5.4B Capital Deployed into Bitcoin Ahead of $100KMeanwhile, amid traders planning to liquidate their holdings around $100K, Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy has just acquired 55,500 BTC tokens at an average cost of $97,862, deploying $5.4 billion to make the new acquisition. This move, as Bitcoin approaches $100K, confirms Saylor's strong belief in even higher targets for the asset.https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1861033309934862601",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/25/top-analysts-say-those-planning-to-sell-bitcoin-at-100k-will-regret-it/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-analysts-say-those-planning-to-sell-bitcoin-at-100k-will-regret-it,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Not in the slightest. We know crypto is cyclical, and planning for the future now is a prudent step. The top cryptos in the next bull run will be the obvious big guns, but the smaller ones can shoot the moon. Chainlink and Polkadot re-established themselves as top cryptos in the cryptosphere this bull run, and they are all set to go even higher the next. On the presale front, the new hybrid exchange Lunex Network is making headlines this bull run and is set to explode in the next bull run. Lunex Network (LNEX): Presale the perfect setup for the next bull run Presales are where investors go to find tomorrow’s top cryptos today. These are ideal investment opportunities as the tokens are at a set price, and many top cryptos that started in presale explode once they hit the markets. Lunex Network is one such presale opportunity. Lunex Network is a new hybrid exchange which stands as a direct threat to centralized exchanges like Binance and decentralized ones like Uniswap. Lunex Network allows users to do cross-chain trading with over 50,000 trading pairs, offers non-custodial wallets, and even has a zero-fee structure to stop fees from eating into crypto profits. Even DeFi is made simple on Lunex Network’s cutting edge platform, which is robust enough for professional traders and easy enough for retail investment. Lunex Network will go far, and getting LNEX tokens in the current presale is the ideal setup for massive gains in the next bull run. Chainlink (LINK): Eth Oracle reestablishing market presence Chainlink was one of the top cryptos in the early days of crypto, serving as a bridge between the “Real world” and the cryptosphere. Chainlink saw its heyday in 2021 when it peaked at $52.89, but then it had a crash akin to the dot-com bubble, and Chainlink lost the bulk of its value. But Chainlink is back, the markets have normalized, and Chainlink is rightfully staking its claim as the top oracle on the market today. This re-establishment of its bona fides sets Chainlink up to shoot the moon in the next bull run. Polkadot (DOT): Interoperability protocol gets a new lease on life Polkadot follows a similar trajectory. Polkadot allows different blockchains to talk to each other and share information. Polkadot is the UN of cryptos, but it has seen a similar dot-com-esquebubble before collapsing after being oversold in the cryptos frenzy of 2021 and 2022. But there’s a great business case to be made from Polkadot, and this bull run has put Polkadotback in its rightful place among the top cryptos. It could certainly become a great performer in the next bull run. Conclusion Bull runs are great, but don’t be afraid of the bears. Bear markets are buying opportunities for the next bull run – imagine buying Solana at $10.00 two years ago. Polkadot and Chainlink are reestablishing themselves as top cryptos ready to rise in the next bull run, and the ongoing LunexNetwork presale is setting up the new hybrid exchange for big things in both the short and long term. Lunex Network is now available at $0.0031 directly from their website marking a substantial 158% return for early investors.

With its innovative features and strong potential, many are already comparing it to Solana’s impressive 35x rise from $7 during its early days. Rollblock's design and scalability promise to transform blockchain technology and become a popular topic for experienced traders and newcomers alike. Ethereum’s Price See's 8% Growth in 7 Days Ethereum gained over 8% within the last week and 27% this month. Ethereum is trading between $3,121.90 and $3,341.60. The 10-day Ethereum simple moving average is above $3,350 versus the 100-day average of $3,168. The Relative Strength Index, near 54, reflects neutral to slightly positive sentiment. A breakout past $3607 could push Ethereum toward $4037, offering significant gains. Technical indicators suggest a promising growth for Ethereum ahead. SEC Advances Talks on Solana ETFs The SEC is advancing discussions on Solana (SOL) spot ETFs with firms like VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and Bitwise, reviewing initial filings for approval. This reflects rising interest in Solana-backed funds. Meanwhile, Solana's native token, SOL, has surged significantly, trading between $211 and $253. Solana gained over 23% in the past week and nearly 54% in the last month. The RSI at 59 indicates strong but sustainable momentum. Resistance levels at $268 and $309 are key to watch, with potential for further growth if breached. Moving averages over 10 and 100 days also confirm an upward trend, showing Solana's bullish dominance.

36837379,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102742,1732547054,On-Chain Analysis Identifies Key Factor Preventing Bitcoin Breakout to $100K,"As Bitcoin faces bearish pressure on the path to its next milestone, on-chain analysis has identified one reason behind its inability to reach the level. In Bitcoin news today, BTC's recent price action has been nothing short of remarkable, especially as it approached the $100,000 mark . Despite reaching a peak of $99,800 on Nov. 22, the leading cryptocurrency failed to breach the psychological milestone, correcting slightly since then. Heavy Profit-Taking by Long-Term HoldersSeveral on-chain indicators and expert analyses suggest the reasons behind this resistance. A recent commentary from on-chain analyst Checkmate revealed a major factor in Bitcoin’s struggle to surpass $100,000: heavy profit-taking by long-term holders (LTHs). Over the past 30 days, LTHs offloaded $60 billion worth of Bitcoin, marking the heaviest distribution of the cycle. This selling pressure accounted for 21% of the total LTH distribution since the market bottomed out after the FTX collapse. Bitcoin LTH Distribution | Checkonchain The analyst stressed that such profit-taking is a natural part of Bitcoin’s market design. Adam Back, Blockstream’s co-founder and CEO, replied in agreement, pointing out that the selling activity dampens upward momentum, preventing Bitcoin from capitalizing on its current supply squeeze. https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1860819116803649667He expressed surprise at the timing, noting that such moves often occur later in bull markets rather than at the start. However, Back emphasized that this selling pressure has prevented the push above $100,000.Bitcoin Faces Short-Term Profit-Taking Notably, data from CryptoQuant further supports the notion that profit realization is playing a critical role in Bitcoin’s near-term resistance.A previous analysis pointed to the Short-Term Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which measures profits taken by investors holding Bitcoin for less than 155 days. Historically, a 30-day moving average SOPR value of 1.02 signals the start of profit-taking during bullish trends. CryptoQuant Currently, the SOPR has reached this level, coinciding with Bitcoin’s correction from its peak. This pattern syncs with past market behavior, where short-term selling pressure resulted in temporary price pullbacks. However, the report noted that strong capital inflows could offset this trend, potentially pushing Bitcoin beyond $100,000 despite the profit-taking headwinds. Bitcoin’s Speculative Demand While profit-taking remains a headwind, other metrics suggest that Bitcoin’s upward trajectory still has momentum. According to another report on CryptoQuant today, speculative demand is on the rise, driven by FOMO, as investors anticipate a breakout above $100,000. This growing demand has led to an increase in the short-term supply of Bitcoin, further bolstering the asset’s price momentum. The analysis pointed out that short-term holders (STHs) have not yet reached the peak selling levels observed during Bitcoin’s previous all-time high of $72,400. This suggests that while some profit-taking is occurring, there remains room for additional price growth. CryptoQuant At press time, Bitcoin changes hands at $97,314, down 0.34% over the past 24 hours. Despite the recent pullback, BTC still boasts a 6.24% gain in the last week, and an impressive 43.5% increase since Nov. 5.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/25/on-chain-analysis-identifies-key-factor-preventing-bitcoin-breakout-to-100k/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=on-chain-analysis-identifies-key-factor-preventing-bitcoin-breakout-to-100k,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The project has announced that its ICO will end on December 20th, leaving sidelined investors with just 25 days to buy the new meme coin. Considering that prominent news outlets like Cointelegraph, CoinMarketCap and Binance Square have regularly featured STARS, it has caught the attention of deep-pocketed whales and is adding over $200k daily to its presale fundraising. The Crypto All-Stars ICO has already raised over $5.7 million, impressing many crypto influencers who are calling it one of the best crypto to buy now. Why Crypto All-Stars Is In Such High Demand? As previously stated, Crypto All-Stars has attracted the attention of deep-pocketed whales. $50k purchases in a single transaction are common for STARS, like a recent $48k buy from 0x6c7db9b966425cd986becc987e035dfdedc8212f. The strong demand isn’t surprising. Crypto All-Stars is a high-utility project which brings several top meme coins under one roof, thanks to its first-ever unified staking model, MemeVault. Built using the secure ERC-1155 standard, MemeVault offers multi-chain, multi-token staking and accepts 11 meme coins including Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), Based Brett (BRETT), Mog Coin (MOG), Milady Meme Coin (LADYS), Turbo (TURBO), Toshi (TOSHI), Coq Inu (COQ) and Bonk (BONK) to begin with. More projects will be added in the future. Additionally, STARS holders can also stake their coins and earn thrice the rewards. In fact, ICO buyers can already stake their holdings in a secondary staking pool , which is currently offering a reward rate of over 330%. Most top meme coins, including Dogecoin and Pepe, do not offer any passive income or secondary utility, subjecting holders to long consolidatory or bearish periods. For instance, while DOGE has been skyrocketing since Donald Trump’s victory, the possibility of a local top, followed by short-term bearishness cannot be underestimated. However, MemeVault ensures that holders continue to generate passive income irrespective of the day-to-day performance of their holdings, making it a must-have tool for the upcoming supercycle. Is STARS A Safe Investment? The return of the bull market has resulted in a spike in scams, rug-pulls and honey-pots, particularly in the meme coin sector. Safety concerns regarding any new meme coin are entirely valid. However, Crypto All-Stars has taken strong steps to alleviate all such concerns and offer safe investment opportunities to meme coin enthusiasts. For instance, the STARS smart contract has been audited twice - once by Coinsult and again by Solid Proof. Neither audit revealed any vulnerability or centralization risks. The Coinsult audit report highlights that the contract ownership has been renounced, which means that the developer team cannot mint new tokens, blacklist addresses, set sell fees or use a honey-pot feature. The smart contract has also passed the SWC Attack Analysis , a series of 27 security checks proposed by EIP-1470. Similarly, the Solid Proof audit report reveals that the contract is not upgradeable, which means that the developer team cannot tamper with it anymore. Moreover, it cannot lock the contract or pause trading, eliminating the risk of scams or rug-pulls. Finally, the MemeVault protocol will also be heavily audited and battle-tested before its launch, ensuring that investors' funds remain safe from any malicious attack. Crypto All-Stars also has sound, community-centric tokenomics, a long-term roadmap and active social media accounts, features mostly missing in new meme coins. Check out the project’s whitepaper or follow its X and Telegram accounts for more information on its unique features. The Best Crypto To Buy Now? Experts believe that the meme coin supercycle is still in its early stages and will pick up pace once the Dogecoin price hits a new all-time high. Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, Bitcoin’s ascent to six figures and more Federal Reserve rate cuts continue to provide the ideal backdrop for new meme coins to skyrocket in the coming weeks. It is, therefore, no surprise that microcap meme tokens continue to create new millionaires. For instance, an early $CHILLGUY buyer turned his $42 investment into $924,000 worth of profits, with another $29,000 left in the token. $42 to $952,000 $Chillguy10 days ago, someone bought $42 (0.2 sol) $Chillguy and now sold majority of it for nearly $924,000 and $29,000 left in token.🤖 https://t.co/RIViuiFH8D pic.twitter.com/ZdZWocswSn — Kakashi (@kkashi_yt) November 25, 2024 Smart money investors believe that Crypto All-Stars can also deliver outsized returns following its December launch, calling it one of the best cryptos to buy now. A few prominent influencers are even eyeing 100x returns from it, owing to its low market capitalization. Interested buyers can still buy STARS at its discounted presale price using the over-the-counter widget on its website. However, they have a very short window - the Crypto All-Stars price is increasing rapidly in the ICO owing to the strong demand. Moreover, the early access staking reward rate is also going down.

This surge has renewed investor interest in meme coins, which often see exponential growth during bull runs. These coins are often driven by community support, social media momentum, and a bit of humor. Yet, historically, they have always delivered outsized returns during bull runs in the cryptocurrency market. In this guide, we’ll take a look at the top 8 meme coins to continue bullish price action as Bitcoin nears $100K. These top 8 best meme coins to buy as Bitcoin nears $100K include established meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and BONK, alongside newer meme coins like Crypto All-Stars, Flockerz, Pepe Unchained, FreeDum Fighters, and CatSlap. Best Meme Coins to Buy As Bitcoin Nears $100K - Top 8 List Here are the top 8 meme coins that could continue their bullish price action as Bitcoin edges closer to $100K: Dogecoin - The Original Meme Coin Crypto All-Stars - World’s First-Ever Meme Vault Shiba Inu - Ethereum-Based Decentralized Token Flockerz - Groundbreaking Vote-To-Earn Meme Coin That Puts The Power In The Hands Of The Community Pepe Unchained - Pepe’s Own L2 Blockchain BONK - The Social Layer And Community Meme Coin Of Solana FreeDum Fighters - Favorite Political Meme Coin CatSlap - The Most Slappable Crypto Meme Coin 8 Meme Coins to Buy As Bitcoin Nears $100K - Full Reviews As Bitcoin nears the $100k mark, these are the top 8 meme coins to buy right now, as these coins are the most likely to continue bullish price actions. From our research, we see that each of these meme coins is poised for significant growth and has the potential to provide high returns for investors. Dogecoin - The Original Meme Coin Dogecoin, which is the people’s cryptocurrency, remains the undisputed leader in the meme coin space. This meme coin has benefited immensely from recent market optimism and Trump's US presidential win, as it has seen the most significant price gains of any meme coin following the just concluded US elections. As Bitcoin approaches $100K, Dogecoin’s massive community support and adoption as a payment method are driving its price, making it one of the best top meme coins to buy. Over the past month only, DOGE gained nearly 200%, rising from $0.13 per coin to its current price of $0.41. As a matter of fact, it is one of the most profitable coins in the markets since the US election results, which can largely attributed to Elon Musk’s role in the Trump administration. Generally, Dogecoin is the trailblazer of meme coins, and it has gained a massive following thanks to its fun, light-hearted approach to cryptocurrency. However, it is not just a token used as a joke. Over the years, Dogecoin has evolved from just a meme coin into a viable digital asset with real-world use cases, especially for tipping and microtransactions. Moreover, the recent uptick in its utility, including partnerships with Tesla for merchandise purchases, continues to enhance its credibility. Now, as Bitcoin approaches its $100K milestone, Dogecoin remains one of the most well-known and actively traded meme coins, and historically, it has always surged during bullish cycles. Its staying power and massive following make it one of the top meme coins to continue bullish price action as Bitcoin nears $100K. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.41 per DOGE/USD with a market cap of $64.24B, which makes DOGE the 7th largest cryptocurrency in the market. This cryptocurrency has seen a 200% gain in one month and a 427% year-to-date gain. Looking ahead, many analysts predict the DOGE can reach over $1 and even higher by the end of 2030. Crypto All-Stars - World’s First-Ever Meme Vault Crypto All-Stars is a newer meme coin that has gained traction within the crypto space due to its unique community-driven model. In essence, Crypto All-Stars aims to carry out the meme coin event of the century as this ultimate meme coin project is uniting the top meme coins worldwide, including big dogs like Dogecoin, PEPE, Mog, Floki, Brett, Milady, Turbo, and more under one umbrella. The meme coin has also developed “the meme vault”, which is a revolutionary staking contract that will allow all the top meme coins to be staked on a single platform, thereby bringing the entire crypto space together as $STARS holders. As Bitcoin’s bullish momentum nears the $100K milestone, Crypto All-Stars could certainly benefit from increased market enthusiasm. Its focus on community engagement and creative token utility positions it as an exciting meme coin for those looking to diversify their portfolios. Best of all, investors can buy $STARS tokens at a discount during the presale and stake them to earn generous APY. Currently, the APY is 340%; however, note that this is a dynamic APY, which simply means it will continue to drop as more tokens are staked.‬ All in all, there’s more than one reason why so many analysts believe Crypto All-Stars can be the next meme coin to explode. At last, it’s worth mentioning that Crypto All Stars has recently announced through its X platform that its presale is ending in 26 days, so investors interested in this meme coin should use this opportunity to get the $STARS token. Since its launch, the presale has raised over $5.5 million, indicating strong interest and confidence from investors. One $STARS is presently trading at just $0.0016061 and can be bought with crypto or directly with a bank card. For more detailed information about the project, you can visit their official site and follow Crypto All-Stars on X . Visit Crypto All-Stars Shiba Inu - Ethereum-Based Decentralized Token Shiba Inu, popularly referred to as the ""Dogecoin killer,"" has carved out its niche through a robust ecosystem. Beyond being a meme coin, Shiba Inu’s ecosystem includes ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and Shibarium, a layer-2 blockchain solution. These developments have significantly increased its utility and attractiveness to long-term investors. With a large, passionate community and aggressive marketing campaigns, Shiba Inu has managed to stay relevant even as other meme coins have risen and fallen in popularity. Over the past month, Shiba Inu’s rally has been directly correlated with the broader market’s positive sentiment, with a monthly return of over 50%. And as Bitcoin edges towards its $100K target, Shiba Inu could see another price surge. As the second-largest meme coin by market capitalization, Shibu Inu continues to hold a spot as one of the most-watched assets in the crypto space. Crucially, the Shiba Inu community, or ""ShibArmy,"" has been instrumental in its success, rallying behind initiatives like charitable donations and community-driven projects. This strong support has ensured steady growth and adoption, making it a favorite coin among investors who value both utility and community spirit. Now, as Bitcoin’s bullish momentum spills over into meme coins, Shiba Inu is well-positioned to capture additional market share, making it one of the top meme coins that will continue bullish price action as Bitcoin nears $100K. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is currently trading at $0.00002563 per SHIB/USD with a market cap of $15.67B, which makes it the 14th largest crypto project in the market. SHIB has seen a nearly 52% gain in one month and a 208% year-to-date gain. Flockerz - Groundbreaking Vote-To-Earn Meme Coin That Puts Power In The Hands Of The Community Flockerz is a new meme coin that is changing the game by involving its community through the Vote-to-Earn (V2E) model, which rewards members with tokens for participating in key decisions about the project’s direction. The meme coin has earned the nickname “The People’s Meme Coin” by putting control in the hands of the community and compensating them for their input. This innovative approach has attracted the attention of several prominent crypto influencers who believe it has the potential for 20x gains amid the ongoing meme coin rally. One of the features that set the new meme coin project in Flockerz apart is its unique approach: It returns control to the community and empowers them to define the project's future using the industry's first Vote-to-Earn (V2E) mechanism. But that’s not all, as investors can also stake their tokens and earn an impressive 700% APY, which is a quick way to boost their voting power in the project. Flockerz also prioritizes transparency and security, which is why Coinsult and SolidProof have already audited its smart contract. Flockerz is still in its early stages but has the potential to stand out as a meme coin with a bit more substance than many of its peers. Its combination of community focus and innovative features positions it as a top pick for investors seeking long-term value in the meme coin market, especially when Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are in a strong uptrend. Since the launch of its presale, Flockerz has raised over $ 3 million, and plans for listings on major exchanges are already in motion, as several crypto experts have predicted it might list on Binance. $FLOCK is currently trading for just $0.0061259 and can be purchased in exchange for ETH, USDT, and BNB or directly through a debit or credit bank card. Those interested in this meme coin can stay up-to-date with the latest news by joining the Flockerz community on X and Telegram .

Recently, Pepe Unchained announced through its X platform that its Layer 2 audit is complete, as it has passed all audit checks and is ready to go. The token and its fully operational Layer 2 will launch a few days after the presale has concluded. Overall, Pepe Unchained’s dedicated block explorer, double-staking rewards on Layer 2, and lower fees make it a compelling choice in the presale market, making it one of the top meme coins to buy as Bitcoin is nearing $100K. And, with the presale coming to a close in the next few days, many analysts suggest that this is the meme coin to buy right now. Take note that the meme coin has 19 left before the presale ends, so investors interested in this meme coin should grab their $PEPU tokens before major exchange listings. Pepe Unchained has so far raised over $40 million from its presale, which puts it among the most successful presales in 2024. One $PEPE is currently trading at $0.01295 and can be purchased directly on the official Pepe Unchained presale page. For more information, visit the page below.

Bitcoin's recent surge to nearly $100K can be attributed to several factors. Perhaps the most significant reason for Bitcoin’s recent rally is the growing optimism in the crypto market, spurred by major developments such as the election of 269 pro-crypto candidates to Congress in the U.S and the victory of Donald Trump in the US elections. Other factors include macroeconomic conditions such as inflation fears, which drive investors toward alternative assets like Bitcoin. Also, the herd behavior phenomenon, where investors follow the actions of the masses, continues to play a role in Bitcoin’s rise. As more people view Bitcoin as a safe haven asset, demand will continue to increase, pushing the price upward. The launch of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Exchange Traded Funds is another major reason for the increase in Bitcoin’s price, as well as other cryptocurrencies. Overall, the broader market sentiment has shifted positively since the beginning of the year, with institutional investors re-entering the space. This enthusiasm is driving significant capital inflows into the broader crypto market, benefiting Bitcoin in particular. Conclusion - Why Is It a Good Time to Buy Meme Coins? With Bitcoin’s rise and the continued bullish momentum in the crypto market, meme coins are in a prime position to benefit from this trend. As Bitcoin nears the $100K milestone, investors are flocking to various assets, including meme coins, seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities. While meme coins can be volatile and speculative, the community-driven nature of these projects and their growing recognition in the crypto space make them an intriguing option for many. For investors willing to embrace the fun and speculative nature of meme coins, now might be the perfect time to add them to a diversified crypto portfolio. Meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and others could continue their bullish price action, delivering exciting returns for those willing to ride the wave. However, as always, it’s essential to do thorough research and understand the risks involved in investing in such volatile assets.

36828549,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740042-microstrategys-misunderstood-business-model?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1732545035,MicroStrategy's Misunderstood Business Model,"Summary MicroStrategy's stock has surged over 567% YTD, driven by its unique business model and substantial Bitcoin holdings. The firm leverages Bitcoin's illiquidity premium and low-interest convertible notes to maximize returns, akin to an investment bank's strategy. Trump's pro-crypto stance and regulatory changes could further boost Bitcoin, benefiting MicroStrategy's stock price. Given its high overbought levels, I rate MSTR as a ""Hold"" due to its potential growth if Bitcoin breaks through and stabilizes above $100,000 apiece. In addition to a number of important market events, the past week has seen the emergence of a new leader in short-term returns. Among both market giants and meme stocks, MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ) is now the undisputed leader, with a year-to-date gain of more than 567% and a market cap now exceeding $94 billion. Bloomberg chart, shared by @EricBalchunas on X Almost everyone who tried to short MSTR has been massively hurt in recent days - this stock has been the leader in the number of covered positions, inevitably driving quotes to new highs: GS trading desk [proprietary source, 11/19/2024] Those who shorted MSTR most likely had the vision that the company's market cap was just a combination of the value of Bitcoin and a premium on that total value fueled by speculators. Let me remind you that MicroStrategy has 331,200 Bitcoins on its balance sheet, which equates to a valuation of $32.44 billion (today's conversion rate). Logically, then, everything looks like we could add an insignificant fair value of MSTR itself to that amount and get a huge premium to NAV, justifying a logical short. But I believe MSTR stock is growing not only because its movement is driven by speculators and people with a pronounced FOMO. The firm has a specific business model that can generally justify the ""premium"" if we look at MSTR like the crypto bulls. While operating outside of the banking industry (MSTR is an ""AI-driven enterprise analytics software and services company"" first of all), MicroStrategy's business model makes sense when viewed in terms of financial concepts such as Net Interest Margin (aka NIM) and illiquidity premium. NIM generally computes the profit margins of a bank's lending by dividing the interest income generated from loans by the interest earned on deposits. In the MicroStrategy instance, it is used metaphorically for its approach to Bitcoin investing. However, rather than make money from loans, MicroStrategy seeks to earn revenue from its Bitcoin investments through minting , putting its bet on Bitcoin's eventual price appreciation. This is like a bank trying to reduce the cost of capital as much as possible while keeping the returns from investments. Yahoo Finance The illiquidity premium is another cornerstone of MicroStrategy's strategy. This premium is simply the extra reward investors want in holding an asset that can’t be readily traded or converted to cash without a steep price discount. Although Bitcoin is one of the most liquid coins on the crypto market, it is also a volatile and speculative coin. Through large stakes in Bitcoin, MicroStrategy is actually attempting to take advantage of this illiquidity premium, and hope that the price of Bitcoin will appreciate over time, leading to greater returns than other more liquid, conventional assets. So MicroStrategy strategically deploys its capital to maximize the potential returns, mobilizing funds efficiently by issuing convertible notes at low interest rates for Bitcoin. On November 21, 2024 , the firm sold $3 billion of unsecured convertible senior notes with no coupon at a 55% conversion premium - this is extremely cheap funding against the backdrop of still high Fed rates (basically at any Fed's rate that's just free $3 billion in funds). In this way, the firm can monetize the long-term appreciation of Bitcoin by enjoying the illiquidity premium. MSTR's press release The strategy allows MicroStrategy to leverage Bitcoin at low-interest rates, securitizing its Bitcoin holdings in the same way that investment banks securitize their client commitments. In doing so, MicroStrategy is the investment bank for Bitcoin , directing capital markets into Bitcoin, and in return purchasing a stake in Bitcoin. This business model isn't necessarily a good thing for investors all the time, since it depends on the appreciation of Bitcoin - a big drop in Bitcoin's value, I suppose, will severely hurt the company. However, looking at the latest events around the crypto industry, I have doubts that the rally in Bitcoin is over. Everyone has already discussed Trump's rise to power in the United States and the implications for Bitcoin. First, Trump has proposed creating a national stockpile of Bitcoin, which he believes could help manage the U.S. debt and strengthen the economy. Secondly, he plans to create a regulatory environment that supports the growth of the crypto industry. This includes appointing crypto advocates to regulatory agencies and replacing the current SEC leadership to create ""clearer and more supportive crypto regulations."" The head of the SEC is already planning to resign, so it appears that this process has already begun. Third, Trump has expressed a desire to expand Bitcoin mining in the US and advocate for increased domestic production. This will require the introduction of tax incentives to attract crypto businesses and investments, which will most likely be implemented in one form or another by the new administration. The regulatory environment in the United States - the world's leading economy - is therefore being created just in time for corporate interest in Bitcoin as a means of payment and accumulation to continue to grow higher and higher. Considering that Bitcoin has limited issuance capacity, I suspect that its price is likely to remain consistently high. I think that the probability that crypto assets will be perceived by the absolute majority of market participants as a new asset class is very, very high after Trump's win. Today, the market cap of the entire crypto market is ~$3.50 trillion, according to Forbes . This seems like a fairly large value, but compared to the capitalization of gold at $18.25 trillion , this is mere pennies, and compared to the stock market ( $109 trillion ), even more so. That said, the crypto industry definitely has room for growth relative to its place in the asset class landscape, so to speak, and Bitcoin, which now occupies ~55% of the entire new asset class, should be the primary beneficiary. If my assumption about the further growth of Bitcoin capitalization is justified against the backdrop of a paradigm shift in attitudes towards cryptocurrencies in general, then the current estimates of MSTR's future revenues will most likely prove to be too pessimistic. Seeking Alpha, MSTR At the same time, however, as you yourself have understood, MSTR is betting all on one horse in this race - if Bitcoin enters a new phase of strong volatility (i.e correction), as it has repeatedly done, then MSTR's leveraged position will play a bad trick on investors. Your Takeaway In my article, I tried not to look at MSTR from the perspective of the general excitement of those who believe in Bitcoin at $1,000,000 apiece; but at the same time, I did not want to use my usual conservative lens and point the finger at MSTR's growing debt, stagnant past growth rates, and extreme levels of P/S ratios over 190x (FY2024) and hundreds of percent premium to NAV. I just wanted to say that viewing MSTR as a Bitcoin wallet trading at a premium to NAV is to basically not understand the company's business model. I think the investment bank analogy is appropriate in this particular case, and that if Bitcoin settles above $100,000-120,000 in the near term, MSTR stock price can continue to grow quite rapidly. At the same time, given Trump's support and the current position of this asset class among the market capitalizations of other global assets, Bitcoin clearly has growth prospects. Given the extreme levels of overboughtness - and that's true when we look at MSTR's technical levels - I rate the stock as a ""Hold"" today.

To read full editions, subscribe . $100,000 is just out of reach right now. We saw some resistance on Friday as bitcoin touched $99.8k before backing down, which isn’t really a surprise when you look at how much bitcoin could be sold just on Coinbase once we hit the elusive record. 1,000 BTC for Sale on Coinbase at $100k pic.twitter.com/RevXCanfia — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) November 22, 2024 In an X post, Galaxy’s Michael Novogratz said this amounts to “normal profit taking” as Alex Thorn’s data shows that a lot of the sellers came in this year above $56,000, and are looking to offload. Galaxy Research @intangiblecoins telling me that most of the selling is coming from 2024 buyers who bought above 56k.. normal profit taking… I still think new buyers are gonna HODL and eating through supply is long term healthy. — Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) November 24, 2024 Despite this being a holiday week for folks in the US (which, on the Wall Street side of things, generally means that volumes are slightly lower), there may be a reason to be bullish on hitting $100k. And, to no one’s surprise, all roads lead back to MicroStrategy. The firm, in an SEC filing this morning, announced that it purchased 55,500 bitcoin — worth $5.4 billion — at the end of last week into the weekend at an average price of nearly $98,000 per bitcoin. The filing was actually kind of expected, given that we knew a big purchase was on the horizon after it announced at the end of last week that it closed its bond offering. And that came after it was upsized to nearly $3 billion from an initial $1.75 billion. The most recent purchase comes on the heels of a $4.6 billion buy earlier this month. That means — if you’re looking at the math — we’ve seen Saylor’s company buy up $10 billion worth of bitcoin this month alone. Wild, right? While Saylor’s purchases are catalysts for price action, it’s not looking like it’s enough to send us over $100k just yet, but perhaps it’ll help folks breach the wall that’s currently in place. After all, there’s one other trend that shows we could break $100,000 sooner rather than later. According to FalconX’s David Lawant, there have been a few notable liquidity shifts in the market. Source: FalconX “BTC reached its highest spot volume print ever on a seven-day moving average basis and for the first time since 2021 is in shooting range of doing the same on the futures side. While spot volumes on the week after the election brought the daily traded value to above $40 billion, over the past week it was slightly lower at $25-35 billion but still two to three times the levels we have been seeing between March 2024 and the election,” Lawant wrote. However, the volume jump hasn’t led to an increase in book order depth, which would together lead to a “stronger” impact on price action. Source: FalconX Essentially, this data shows that $100,000 remains a tough level to break through, but “the overall picture remains encouraging,” according to Lawant. If MicroStrategy’s buy isn’t enough to send us over the wall, perhaps we’re just a CZ post away. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

These contributions helped create a Republican-led Senate and a Congress that is ready to implement crypto-friendly reforms. The upcoming resignations of SEC Chair Gary Gensler and Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga also suggests that a big shift in the way crypto regulation is approached is just around the corner. America’s Congress Benefits from $245 Million in PAC Support Bernie Moreno, who was once known as a car dealership owner from Cleveland, Ohio, became a well known political figure after his victory over Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown in the 2024 Senate race. Despite his lack of any prior political experience and a failed Senate bid in 2022, Moreno's alignment with the crypto industry propelled him to the forefront of a broader movement to reshape Congress with pro-crypto legislators. His campaign received very impressive financial backing, and the crypto sector alone contributed about $40 million to his efforts. This financial support was part of a much larger trend, as cryptocurrency-related Political Action Committees (PACs) and affiliated groups spent more than $245 million during the 2024 election cycle. This accounted for almost half of all corporate contributions, according to Public Citizen. One of the key players in this initiative was the Stand With Crypto Alliance, which is an advocacy group that was launched by Coinbase. The group implemented a strategic grading system to allocate funding to candidates supportive of blockchain innovation, and helped nearly 300 pro-crypto lawmakers secure election victories. The crypto industry’s strategy deviated from more traditional lobbying methods, and focused instead on shaping the electoral landscape by identifying allies and adversaries in the political arena. This approach proved very effective, as pro-crypto candidates like Moreno benefited from endorsements and insights from influential people like Silicon Valley leaders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, as well as Coinbase co-founders Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam. Coinbase itself played a pivotal role by directing more than $75 million through its super PAC, Fairshake, which exclusively supported pro-crypto candidates . Fairshake’s influence extended across party lines, and backed candidates in critical Senate races in Arizona, Michigan, and West Virginia. By the end of the election cycle, Fairshake already raised $78 million in preparation for the 2026 midterms. Key contributors to this financial powerhouse included Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, who donated $12 million, along with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who collectively gave $10.1 million. Moreno’s campaign also gained credibility through his blockchain startup, Champ Titles. The startup focuses on digitizing vehicle titling and registration. This improved his image as a forward-thinking candidate, and also aligned with the crypto industry’s vision for the future. The election cycle’s outcome delivered a Republican-led Senate and a Congress that is poised to support crypto-friendly policies. This shift became very clear after it was announced that SEC Chair Gary Gensler will retire on inauguration day. U.S. Crypto Policies Could Still Drive Innovators Away Coin Center , a non-profit crypto advocacy group, warned that while a Trump presidency could be beneficial for the crypto industry, deeply entrenched policies might still deter innovators from operating in the United States. In a blog post that was published on Nov. 21, Coin Center’s research director, Van Valkenburgh, identified three big threats facing crypto users and developers in the U.S. as 2025 approaches. These threats were broadly categorized as ”surveillance issues,” and includes tax reporting requirements, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies, and criminal proceedings against non-custodial crypto services. The first concern stems from the crypto reporting mandates under Section 6050I of the U.S. tax code, which require people receiving $10,000 or more in crypto to report these transactions to the IRS without a warrant. Coin Center argued that these requirements violate constitutional protections, and were outlined in their objections last August. The second and third threats relate to sanctions that were imposed on Tornado Cash and the resulting criminal charges for unlicensed money transmission against its founder, Roman Storm, and the Bitcoin wallet service Samourai Wallet. Coin Center warned that these charges could establish some troubling precedents for developers of non-custodial crypto services. While the Trump administration is expected to adopt a much more crypto-friendly stance, Valkenburgh pointed out that overzealous sanctions and AML policies might still persist. He specifically mentioned that the Department of Justice values its political independence, and might not withdraw ongoing prosecutions despite a change in administration. Valkenburgh believes there is a serious need for progress in addressing these challenges, and also warned that continued enforcement of rigid surveillance measures could drive crypto innovators away from the U.S. This will deny Americans the benefits of blockchain technologies. He also argued that these policies actually do very little to deter criminal activity, and he called for a reevaluation of the balance between regulation and innovation. SEC Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga Also Resigns A second high-ranking official from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced plans to step down. Many believe that this is the start of the highly anticipated shift in the agency's leadership. SEC Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga revealed on Nov. 22 that he will resign on Jan. 17, less than three years after his appointment. Lizárraga’s decision to step down was motivated by personal reasons, particularly to spend more time with his wife, who is battling cancer. Lizárraga’s career with the SEC started in the 1990s as a deputy director of legislative affairs. He later served as a senior adviser to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for over a decade, and contributed to major financial legislation, including the Dodd-Frank Act. As a commissioner, Lizárraga focused on regulation related to climate risk, cybersecurity, and data breach disclosures. SEC Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga His resignation was announced after the announcement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s upcoming departure. With both officials leaving, the SEC will see a diminished Democratic presence as President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC adopted a very strict stance on the crypto industry that placed a lot of emphasis on enforcement actions. However, Trump vowed to take a different approach, and also appealed to crypto voters by promising to dismiss Gensler and potentially ushering in a more industry-friendly regulatory environment. This anticipated shift already sparked action in financial markets. On the same day Gensler announced his departure, the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s BZX Exchange filed applications to list spot Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from asset managers including Bitwise , VanEck , 21Shares , and Canary Capital . These leadership changes at the SEC, combined with a new administration in the White House, suggest a potential pivot in the agency’s stance on digital assets and financial innovation. The cryptocurrency community has been asking for regulatory clarity and less aggressive enforcement for a while now, and the Trump administration could finally provide this for the industry.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | OTHER,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6203/crypto-pa-cs-pumped-245-million-into-most-crypto-friendly-congress,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

It cited a recent report from the Hong Kong Association of Banks showing that 70% of respondents believe that banks providing access to virtual assets would ease the complications of acquiring the in-demand investment vehicles.Notably, ZA Bank announced the launch in partnership with the crypto exchange HashKey. The exchange's CEO, Livio Weng, noted that the collaboration aims to drive innovation among digital banking services in Asia.Meanwhile, HashKey is one of the only three licensed exchanges in Hong Kong, gaining regulatory approval in 2022.

According to Coinsshares' weekly report , crypto investment products achieved a record-breaking milestone last week, logging net inflows of $3.13 billion, the highest on record. This surge, fueled primarily by U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, propelled year-to-date inflows to a record $37 billion and assets under management (AUM) to an all-time high of $153.3 billion.U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Drive the SurgeU.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs led the charge, contributing $3.38 billion to the weekly inflows.

Amid rising demand for stablecoins and surging Bitcoin prices, Tether minted $3 billion in USDt tokens in a single day, while Cantor Fitzgerald reportedly acquired a 5% stake in Tether , valued at up to $600 million. These developments come as Cantor’s CEO, Howard Lutnick, prepares to step into his new role as US Secretary of Commerce under President-elect Donald Trump, signaling a potential shift in how stablecoins are viewed and regulated in the United States. Tether Mints $3 Billion in USDt Amid Surging Crypto Trading Volume and Bitcoin’s Historic Rally Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, has minted an additional $3 billion in USDt tokens on the Ethereum and Tron networks, capitalizing on the crypto market’s heightened trading activity. The minting, which took place on Nov. 23, 2024, comes as Bitcoin inches closer to the landmark $100,000 price level, fueled by political tailwinds and growing institutional interest. Data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that $2 billion of the new USDt tokens were minted on the Ethereum blockchain, while $1 billion was issued on the Tron network in consecutive transactions. The significant minting activity is part of a larger trend, with blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reporting that Tether has minted approximately $13 billion in USDt since Nov. 8, 2024. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino commented on the company's ambitious trajectory, stating, ”In 2025, Tether will need to reach hyper-productivity to accomplish our grand vision.” Stablecoins like USDt play a pivotal role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, acting as a bridge between fiat currencies and digital assets. High stablecoin issuance is often viewed as a bullish market indicator, reflecting increased trading activity and investor confidence. Conversely, low minting volumes can signal waning interest in the market. The surge in USDt issuance aligns with a dramatic rally in Bitcoin, whose price has soared from $69,000 to over $99,000 in the wake of the United States presidential elections. This increase in Bitcoin's price has triggered a corresponding demand for stablecoins, which are widely used by traders to enter and exit positions efficiently. Political Shifts and Tether's Strategic Positioning The post-election crypto market rally has been buoyed by optimism surrounding President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypto administration. Trump's appointment of Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and a prominent crypto advocate, as commerce secretary has further bolstered market sentiment. Notably, Cantor Fitzgerald manages Tether's US Treasury reserves, which back the USDt stablecoin. Bitcoin's historic rally has reignited speculation about its long-term price trajectory. Adam Back, a renowned Cypherpunk and Bitcoin developer, recently suggested that Bitcoin's price could climb as high as $1 million if a Bitcoin strategic reserve is established under the Trump administration. Such a move could trigger a digital ”arms race” among nation-states vying to accumulate Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The growing institutional adoption and political tailwinds have set the stage for a transformative period in the crypto industry. Tether's strategic positioning as the leading stablecoin issuer places it at the forefront of this evolution, enabling the company to capitalize on the increased demand for digital asset liquidity. Overall, Tether's recent minting of $3 billion in USDt suggests there is a growing demand for stablecoins amid surging crypto trading volumes and bullish market sentiment. With Bitcoin nearing the $100,000 milestone and a pro-crypto administration poised to take office in the United States, Tether is well-positioned to play a pivotal role in the next chapter of the cryptocurrency market's evolution. As the world watches Bitcoin’s ascent and stablecoins like USDt continue to dominate the digital asset landscape, Tether’s ability to scale operations and maintain its market leadership will be a critical factor in shaping the future of decentralized finance. Cantor Fitzgerald’s Stake in Tether Signals Potential Political Support Under Trump Administration Meanwhile, in a move that could reshape the relationship between traditional finance and cryptocurrency, financial services giant Cantor Fitzgerald has reportedly acquired a 5% stake in stablecoin issuer Tether . The stake, valued at up to $600 million at the time of the agreement, has sparked widespread speculation about the implications for both companies and the broader cryptocurrency market as the Trump administration takes office. The Wall Street Journal reported on Nov. 24 that the stake acquisition positions Cantor Fitzgerald as one of Tether’s most significant partners. The timing of the deal and its potential ramifications are particularly noteworthy, given that Cantor Fitzgerald’s CEO, Howard Lutnick, has been named Secretary of Commerce by US President-elect Donald Trump. Lutnick is already serving as a key transition adviser for Trump, vetting candidates for top government positions, including roles that could oversee regulatory matters involving Tether. This development comes as Tether faces ongoing scrutiny from the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, which has been investigating allegations that the stablecoin is being misused by third parties for illicit activities such as terrorism financing. Lutnick’s dual role as an incoming government official and a pivotal figure in Cantor Fitzgerald has raised questions about how his political clout could influence the regulatory landscape for Tether. According to sources cited by the Wall Street Journal, Tether shareholder Giancarlo Devasini expressed confidence that Lutnick would work to “defuse threats facing Tether” through his influence in Washington. Such speculation is not without precedent. Lutnick has publicly championed Tether and other dollar-backed stablecoins, highlighting their critical role in providing financial stability in high-inflation economies like Argentina, Turkey, and Venezuela. His vocal support for the crypto sector, combined with Cantor Fitzgerald’s significant stake in Tether, could signal a more favorable regulatory environment for the stablecoin issuer. Cantor Fitzgerald’s Pivotal Role Cantor Fitzgerald has been one of Tether’s most important banking partners, especially as the stablecoin issuer has faced banking challenges globally. The firm holds the bulk of Tether’s $134 billion reserves, primarily in US Treasury bills. In July 2024, Lutnick announced a new Bitcoin lending program at the Bitcoin 2024 conference, signaling Cantor Fitzgerald’s growing commitment to the crypto sector. “We will offer leverage to those who own Bitcoin. We are going to launch with $2 billion of lending,” Lutnick said at the time, further emphasizing the firm’s interest in expanding its digital asset offerings. Lutnick’s nomination as Secretary of Commerce and his connection to Tether through Cantor Fitzgerald could provide a political lifeline for the embattled stablecoin issuer. Tether has long been the subject of regulatory scrutiny, but its close ties to a key figure in the incoming administration may shift the narrative. Analysts suggest that Lutnick’s role could lead to more nuanced and potentially favorable policies regarding stablecoins and their use in global markets. However, the potential for conflict of interest has also raised concerns. Critics argue that Lutnick’s involvement in shaping regulatory policy could unfairly benefit Tether and raise ethical questions about the intersection of business and government. The Cantor-Tether partnership comes at a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency industry. The Trump administration’s stance on digital assets, particularly with pro-crypto advocates like Lutnick in key positions, could set the tone for how the U.S. approaches the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. The reported deal has also drawn attention to the broader role of stablecoins in the financial ecosystem. As a bridge between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, stablecoins like USDt are integral to the industry’s growth. The support of major financial institutions like Cantor Fitzgerald highlights their increasing acceptance in traditional finance.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6208/tether-mints-3-billion-in-us-dt-as-bitcoin-approaches-100-k,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

36827694,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654812,1732543228,Toncoin (TON) Rebounds Above $6: Is A Sustainable Rally In Sight?,"Toncoin (TON) has surged past the $6 mark, rekindling hopes for a sustained bullish rally. After facing a challenging period of bearish pressure, this recovery has sparked curiosity among investors and traders alike. The key question is whether the bulls have what it takes to maintain this momentum and push TON higher. As Toncoin navigates a pivotal moment, this article aims to explore its breakout above the $6 level, delving into the forces behind the move and evaluating its potential to sustain its strength. By analyzing key technical indicators and market dynamics, we will provide insights into whether TON’s rally could evolve into a long-term bullish trend. Indicators To Consider If Toncoin Can Maintain Its Uptrend TON is demonstrating renewed positive strength, rebounding above the $6 mark and signaling a notable shift in market sentiment. Increased buying pressure has driven further price growth, positioning TON on a stronger footing. Significantly, the token has risen above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, a key indicator that reinforces the prevailing bullish trend. An examination of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the indicator has climbed to 60% after declining to 53%, signaling a resurgence in buying pressure and reflecting renewed upbeat momentum in the market. A break above the 60% level would indicate strong overbought conditions, suggesting robust demand and the possibility of more price gains. Related Reading: Toncoin Sharpe Ratio Rising, Is TON Readying For $8? Also, the daily chart reveals strong upward movement for Toncoin, marked by a strong rejection wick as it recovers above the $6 level. Trading above the crucial 100-day SMA reinforces the positive trend, indicating sustained strength. As TON continues to climb, it bolsters market confidence, setting the stage for growth with the $7.2 resistance level as the next key target to watch, which could determine whether the bullish move extends further. The daily chart’s RSI at 80% implies robust upside momentum since buyers are firmly in control and pushing Toncoin’s price higher. This surge follows a brief pullback to 65%, which acted as a cooling-off phase before renewed buying pressure kicked in. With the RSI positioned above the critical 50% level, TON’s rally may extend, triggering continued optimism in the market. Potential Challenges Ahead For TON’s Rally Although TON’s recent rally above $6 shows strong potential, several challenges could disrupt its positive movement. Toncoin is nearing overbought conditions, as reflected by its RSI, which may lead to resistance or a pullback. If this occurs, the asset could decline below $6, possibly heading toward the $4.6 support level and further downward.

As digital currencies continue to capture the public's imagination, I've noticed a distinct shift in how individuals approach investing in this dynamic space. Unlike traditional markets, where strategies are often cautious and methodical, the crypto realm invites a more adventurous spirit. Retail investors in crypto seem to embrace a blend of optimism and curiosity, often driven by the potential for significant returns. It's intriguing to observe how they navigate the volatility with a mix of research, instinct, and community insights. This vibrant ecosystem fosters a sense of empowerment, as people from all walks of life explore new financial frontiers. Understanding these behaviours not only sheds light on the evolving financial landscape but also highlights the innovative ways individuals engage with their investments. Key Takeaways Retail crypto investors exhibit a unique mix of optimism and adventurous strategies, influenced by the potential for high returns and decentralised finance options. Community insights and social media play a critical role in shaping investment decisions, fostering a collaborative environment for sharing knowledge and experiences. Young adults, particularly males, dominate the retail crypto investment demographic, with growing interest from diverse global regions, illustrating cryptocurrency's worldwide appeal. Psychological factors, such as FOMO and emotional biases, significantly affect investment behaviours, highlighting the need for disciplined risk management and strategic decision-making. Evolving regulations and market volatility impact retail investor actions, with regulatory clarity providing a sense of security despite the crypto market's inherent unpredictability. Understanding Retail Crypto Investor Behaviour Motivations for Investing I've seen retail crypto investors driven by dreams of big returns. They aim for financial independence. High returns tempt them. FOMO often nudges them to invest quickly. Personal experiences tell me that diving in is both thrilling and challenging. Decentralisation also attracts those disillusioned with traditional finance systems, providing alternative investment paths. This drive has spurred significant interest in the crypto world. Risk Tolerance and Strategies I've noticed a remarkable willingness to embrace risk among retail crypto investors. They accept the volatility attached to these investments and engage in speculative trading. Retail investors often adopt high-risk strategies, hoping to capitalise on market fluctuations. The potential for immense gains, despite the risks, appeals to their adventurous nature. Community and Insights I find community insights invaluable in crypto investing. Many investors rely on forums and social media for information. It's amazing how shared experiences shape decisions. They're learning from each other. Within these communities, strategies and insights resonate, contributing to dynamic decision-making and fostering a sense of belonging amongst retail crypto investors. Analysing Investment Trends In the realm of cryptocurrency, retail investors are notable for their high risk tolerance and speculative tendencies. These trends showcase a dynamic and evolving market landscape. Popular Cryptocurrencies among Retail Investors Bitcoin and Ethereum hold significant interest among retail investors. These digital assets are appealing due to their market prominence and potential for robust returns. I frequently notice investors exploring newer coins like Solana and Cardano, attracted by innovation and community support. These popular choices reflect the desire for both stability and potential growth. It's fascinating how these preferences can shift based on market conditions and emerging technologies. Investment Demographics: Age, Gender, and Geography Retail crypto investors span various ages, but young adults dominate the scene. Many in their twenties and thirties engage actively, driven by tech-savviness and future financial aspirations. Males tend to represent a larger portion of this group, although female participation is growing. I've seen active communities in regions like North America and Europe, while interest is soaring in areas like Asia and Africa. The diverse demographics demonstrate a global appeal, broadening the market's reach and impact. Examining Motivations Behind Investment Understanding my motivations for investing in cryptocurrencies offers valuable insights. Retail investors like me often balance aspirations for high returns against the fear of missing out, shaping a complex and adventurous investment landscape. Seeking High Returns on Investment I find cryptocurrencies intriguing due to potential high returns. Their market volatility offers both risk and reward. Studies reveal many investors share this mindset. The allure of achieving financial independence through crypto is significant. I focus on innovation and growth, seeking opportunities not available in traditional investments. These ambitious pursuits fuel my enthusiasm for the market's possibilities. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) FOMO is a powerful influence on my investment decisions. It drives the urgency to participate in promising markets. Many investors feel this alongside seeking community trends. Social media amplifies this effect for me, highlighting missed opportunities. Engaging with forums offers shared insights. However, I view this pressure as empowering, pushing me to adapt and learn from the dynamic crypto ecosystem. Assessing Risk Tolerance and Strategies Retail crypto investors, including myself, thrive on the thrill of the unpredictable, embracing both potential gains and losses. Understanding our risk tolerance and employing effective strategies becomes crucial. Risk Management Techniques Employed Effective risk management is vital when investing in crypto. I calculate the amount I'm willing to lose before making a trade. Diversifying my portfolio by investing in multiple cryptocurrencies helps reduce the impact of a single failure. I also use stop-loss orders to limit losses, protecting myself from sudden market drops. Staying informed and accessing community insights plays a critical role in my decision-making process, allowing me to adapt rapidly. These techniques have preserved my capital and aided my experimental approach. Trading Strategies Utilised by Retail Investors I often employ short-term trading strategies to seize quick market opportunities. Buying during rallies and selling during downturns is a strategy retail investors like me frequently use. Swing trading involves capturing short-term gains, aligning perfectly with my risk appetite. I rely on technical analysis to identify trends and adapt my trades accordingly. Scalping, where I make many small profits, utilises market volatility to my advantage, allowing for quick returns. These strategies reflect the flexibility and adaptability required in the ever-changing crypto market, offering both challenges and rewards. Observing Psychological Influences Retail crypto investors are heavily swayed by psychological factors that differ from those seen in traditional markets. Impact of Social Media and Influencers Social media shapes how retail crypto investors behave. I see many investors relying on trends set by influential personalities online. Platforms like Twitter and Reddit become hubs for crypto news. They fuel quick decisions. Following a popular influencer often leads to herd behaviour. I've seen price spikes driven by viral posts. This power of influencers makes understanding digital trends crucial for retail investors. Role of Emotional Biases in Decision-Making Emotions heavily influence decision-making in crypto investing. FOMO is a real force I feel sometimes. Knowing others are profiting can prompt impulsive investments. Risk tolerance is often stretched as emotional biases overshadow logic. Holding on during market dips can be tough. I've watched my instincts conflict with practical strategies. Embracing discipline helps manage emotional biases efficiently. Evaluating Regulatory and Market Impact Retail crypto investors face constant shifts due to regulatory and market dynamics. Understanding these influences helps navigate the evolving landscape confidently. Influence of Regulatory Changes on Behaviour Regulatory shifts strongly influence our investment behaviour. I once viewed the growing regulatory clarity as daunting. However, over half of respondents in Strategy& Crypto Survey 2023 find it beneficial. Regulation offers consumer financial protection, shielding us from potential pitfalls. Antoinette Schoar stresses regulation's importance to protect uninformed investors. I feel more secure with these safeguards, encouraging me to invest further in this volatile market. Effect of Market Volatility and Events Market volatility can be both exhilarating and challenging. I thrive on adapting to sudden shifts, drawing inspiration from other investors. When events like price surges or crashes occur, I engage in forums for insights. Discussing market reactions and predictions enhances my understanding. These exchanges build community bonds, making the dynamic environment enjoyable. I appreciate the unpredictability, which compels me to stay informed and continuously evolve my strategies to suit market conditions. Conclusion Retail crypto investors are reshaping the financial landscape with their vibrant and daring approach. Their willingness to embrace risk and adapt to rapid changes sets them apart from traditional investors. The interplay of optimism, community insights, and a thirst for financial independence fuels their journey. As they navigate the complexities of the crypto market, they rely on a blend of instinct and informed decision-making. This dynamic ecosystem not only offers potential rewards but also challenges that require resilience and discipline. By staying informed and connected, retail investors continue to thrive in this ever-evolving space, driving innovation and growth.

Liquidity, the ease with which assets can be bought or sold without affecting their price, is crucial for both traders and investors. It ensures that transactions are smooth and efficient, bringing stability to an otherwise volatile environment. Understanding liquidity dynamics can offer insights into market trends and potential investment opportunities. As I explored this realm, I realised how pivotal liquidity is in shaping the cryptocurrency landscape. It affects everything from pricing to market confidence, making it an essential factor for anyone keen on digital assets. By grasping the nuances of liquidity, I've gained a deeper appreciation for the intricate mechanisms that underpin the crypto market. This knowledge not only enhances my trading strategies but also enriches my overall experience within this ever-evolving financial frontier. Key Takeaways Importance of Liquidity: Understanding liquidity is crucial for cryptocurrency traders as it ensures smooth, efficient transactions and contributes to market stability amidst volatility. Influences on Liquidity: Factors like trading volume, market microstructures, and investor attention significantly impact liquidity, affecting price dynamics and market confidence. Centralised vs Decentralised Exchanges: Centralised exchanges offer greater liquidity and stability, while decentralised platforms, despite their challenges, provide transparency and control. Role of Stablecoins: Stablecoins offer stability in volatile markets, facilitate arbitrage opportunities, and support consistent trading environments, enhancing overall market liquidity. Liquidity Risks and Volatility: Low liquidity can lead to significant price volatility; managing risks through active monitoring and utilising stablecoins can improve trading outcomes. Understanding Cryptocurrency Liquidity Dynamics Recognising Key Influences I've seen Bitcoin-specific factors impact liquidity although you'd think it's unpredictable. Realised volatility plays a pivotal role. As prices surge, so does liquidity. High trading volumes usually signify active market participation. Hash rates and Google searches also matter more than I expected. Observing Market Microstructures The market microstructure influences liquidity. I noticed how news affects trades instantly. Positive news spikes liquidity. The opposite's true for negative news. It visibly drops after unfavourable announcements. I learned to anticipate these swings for better strategies. Engaging Investor Attention Investor attention drives dynamics more than I imagined. Cryptocurrency tweets can boost liquidity figures quickly. Engaging online audiences creates real-time market changes. I could see how seasoned traders often watch social media trends. Observing these aspects, I grasped the fluidity of cryptocurrency trades. Recognising patterns, I enhanced my trading approach. Understanding these factors meant I improved my decision-making skill. Exploring these dynamics, I found new investment opportunities. Exploring Key Factors Affecting Liquidity Delving into what influences cryptocurrency liquidity has opened my eyes to its complexity. Understanding these factors has enriched my trading experience and strategy. Market Depth and Order Book Analysis Market depth plays a central role in understanding liquidity. It refers to the array of buy and sell orders at various levels. A robust order book signals a healthy market. I’ve noticed deeper markets with varied orders enhance liquidity. Analysing these orders helps me make informed trading decisions. Trading Volume and its Impact Trading volume directly affects cryptocurrency liquidity. Higher volumes usually mean greater liquidity. I rely on volume data to gauge market interest. Consistent trading volumes boost market stability, which I've found crucial. Increased volume indicates active engagement and widens my investment scope. Role of Market Makers Market makers are pivotal in maintaining liquidity. They provide buy and sell quotations, ensuring smoother transactions. I appreciate how market makers balance supply and demand. They help stabilise prices. Experiencing their influence first-hand improved my trading outcomes. They ensure tighter spreads, reducing costs. Assessing Liquidity Across Different Exchanges Exploring liquidity across exchanges reveals interesting dynamics. Each exchange type presents its unique set of challenges and opportunities, shaping my understanding of the market in surprising ways. Centralised Exchanges and Liquidity Provision Centralised exchanges are integral to liquidity. High trading volumes mark these platforms, especially for popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. They attract a large user base, which means transactions happen fast with little price impact. I find their compliance with regulations reassuring. It hints at stability and security. User-friendly interfaces make trading smooth, drawing even more participants. It's fascinating how swiftly orders get executed here. Banks seamlessly integrate with centralised exchanges. This link often boosts liquidity while offering a traditional finance comfort zone. Decentralised Exchanges and Liquidity Challenges Decentralised exchanges present unique liquidity challenges. They lack central authority oversight. This makes transactions more secure yet sometimes slow. I love their transparency and user control. However, the fragmented order books can hinder liquidity. You often see wider spreads here. Decentralised exchanges sometimes struggle with large trades due to limited orders. Their peer-to-peer nature can lead to less liquidity. Users provide liquidity via automated market makers, which is a novel concept but not always sufficient. These platforms are evolving fast, incorporating new technologies. Their decentralised nature fascinates me despite the hurdles. Examining the Role of Stablecoins in Liquidity Stablecoins play a crucial role in cryptocurrency liquidity dynamics. They offer stability in an otherwise volatile market, making them indispensable for traders. Stablecoins as a Source of Stability Stablecoins, pegged to currencies like the US dollar, mitigate cryptocurrency volatility. I've noticed they provide a reliable anchor amid market turbulence. Their predictable value helps maintain a consistent trading environment. This stability encourages more participants to trade, increasing overall liquidity. Transactions involving stablecoins often experience fewer price swings, making them attractive for frequent traders seeking low-risk exchanges. Stablecoins simplify complex market applications by providing a stable reference point. Arbitrage Opportunities with Stablecoins Stablecoins create new arbitrage opportunities by bridging price differences across exchanges. I've capitalised on these opportunities, maximising returns while sustaining liquidity. A stable value allows me to exploit price discrepancies with confidence. Their presence facilitates swift execution of arbitrage trades, enhancing market efficiency. Profiting from inconsistent prices requires a stable, predictable asset base. Participating in these trades has not only boosted my profitability but also contributed to narrowing price gaps across platforms. This, in turn, strengthens overall market stability. Analysing Liquidity Risks and Volatility Understanding liquidity risks and their impact on price volatility is crucial in the cryptocurrency market. My experience has shown how vital it is to manage these aspects effectively. Impact of Liquidity on Price Volatility Liquidity directly affects price stability. When liquidity's low, even small trades can lead to big price swings. I've seen this play out on decentralised exchanges. They often have less liquidity, making prices jump with minimal transactions. As a trader, I appreciate the stability high liquidity brings. It allows me to execute trades smoothly without worrying about sudden price changes. Market depth and transaction volumes serve as indicators of potential volatility. By analysing them, I gain insights into upcoming market movements. This knowledge helps me make smarter trades and capitalise on market opportunities. Managing Liquidity Risks in Cryptocurrency Markets Managing liquidity risks requires active participation. I study the order books and monitor trading volumes to ensure I'm prepared. I choose centralised exchanges for high volumes. They're more stable and offer better liquidity. Market makers play a role too. They provide essential buy and sell quotes. With their presence, pricing gaps are smaller, leading to risk reduction. Integrating stablecoins into my trades has been beneficial. They provide price stability, reducing the volatility risk. I leverage stablecoins to bridge price exchanges, finding arbitrage opportunities. These practices not only enhance safety but also improve trading outcomes. Conclusion Navigating cryptocurrency liquidity dynamics requires a keen understanding of various market factors. By focusing on elements like trading volumes and market depth, I've honed my trading strategies and improved my decision-making. Centralised exchanges remain my preferred choice due to their robust liquidity and stability. However, I recognise the potential of decentralised platforms as they evolve. Stablecoins have become invaluable tools in my trading arsenal, offering stability and facilitating efficient arbitrage. Managing liquidity risks is crucial, and I actively monitor market conditions to ensure smoother trade execution. Through these insights, I've gained a deeper appreciation for the complexities of the crypto market, enhancing my investment approach.

A pullback had been expected as traders took profits after last week's surge to nearly $100,000. XRP and DOGE led the drop, both losing more than 5%, while ETH, SOL and ADA fell between 2%-5%. They all also pared losses, posting gains in the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which offers a broad measure of the digital asset market, climbed 1.7% thanks to some healthy increases among smaller altcoins like AVAX and LINK.  Crypto-tracked futures took a beating with over $500 million in liquidations on both longs and shorts amid the volatility. Over $366 million in longs and $127 million in shorts evaporated, Coinglass data shows. Traders, however, don’t appear to consider the pullback concerning. “It's clear that Bitcoin has been leading the market, a key indicator that much of the demand is driven by institutions buying ETFs,"" Jeff Mei, COO at crypto exchange BTSE, told CoinDesk. “We also believe that institutions will start buying into the Ethereum ETFs soon and, hopefully, the Solana ones once they're approved. With the stock market making steady gains and the Trump transition team meeting with a number of crypto executives to discuss pro-crypto policies, it looks promising that this rally will continue into 2025,” Mei added.  Brokers Bernstein and Canaccord raised their price targets for MicroStrategy, while maintaining their positive ratings for the stock. Bernstein raised its target to $600 from $290, while Canaccord has increased it to $510 from $300. Bernstein said it expects MicroStrategy to own 4% of the world's bitcoin supply by 2033. It currently has 1.7%. Michael Saylor's company said last month that it planned to buy $42 billion of bitcoin over the next three years. ""We believe bitcoin is in a structural bull market with conducive regulation and U.S. government support, institutional adoption and favorable macro,"" analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the difference between intraday spot buying and selling volumes for bitcoin (BTC).

Saylor uses MicroStrategy’s NAV premium to issue convertible notes and ATM offerings, boosting BTC per share and driving shareholders' gains in Bitcoin terms and - so far - share price. MicroStrategy owns 1.5% of total Bitcoin supply, positioning itself as a thought leader and bridge between TradFi and Bitcoin - I see this as a competitive advantage supporting its NAV premium. The strategy hinges on Bitcoin maturing into a global reserve asset. Failure to maintain its NAV premium or a significant drop in Bitcoin prices below $20,000 could undermine MSTR’s position. I remain bullish on MicroStrategy, holding my 150 shares and potentially adding more. For believers in Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a global reserve asset, MSTR is a BUY in my opinion. MicroStrategy overview I hold 150 shares in MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), which represent roughly 10% of my main investment portfolio. With MSTR reaching new All-Time-Highs, an ongoing Bitcoin (BTC-USD) bull run, and the ticker getting added to the Nasdaq 100, I have recently reflected on whether I should sell part of my position. After researching, I have decided not to. I believe there is still potential upside to this stock, assuming the Bitcoin bull run continues. I believe many analysts misunderstand Michael Saylor’s vision for MicroStrategy, focusing too much on its premium to Bitcoin holdings rather than its broader strategy. In this article, I’ll explain why I think Saylor aims to position MicroStrategy as the first “Bitcoin bank” and outline the investment thesis for the company. This is my second article on MicroStrategy. My previous coverage was when the stock traded at $122, where I rated it a BUY for investors comfortable with high volatility. What is Saylor doing? The NAV Premium “money glitch” Saylor has a chest containing Bitcoin worth roughly $35 Billion (MicroStrategy), and he is somehow able to convince the market to buy rights to this chest (shares in MicroStrategy) for 3 or more times the value of what’s in the chest. MicroStrategy also has a software business, but I think it’s negligible relative to its Bitcoin holdings and I will not take it into consideration for my analysis. I will cover MicroStrategy’s rich NAV premium later, but first I want to explain what Saylor is doing to profit from this situation. He pockets the difference between the value of Bitcoin in his chest and whatever the market is willing to pay for MicroStrategy. He does so in two ways: By issuing Convertible Notes - corporate bonds that can be converted by the bondholders into equity at a given price, at a later date. With At-The-Market ((ATM)) offerings - which means issuing new shares at market prices, diluting existing shareholders. Saylor uses the premium to purchase more Bitcoin for MicroStrategy, resulting in an ever-increasing BTC per share (see chart below). MSTR; BTC per Share 2020 to date (mstr-tracker.com) As a result of this strategy, shareholders are diluted in fiat terms, but they have registered a substantial gain in Bitcoin terms - as their shares “entitle” them to an ever-increasing amount of Bitcoin. In other words, normally, a company issuing new shares should see its price fall. However, because MicroStrategy is able to increase its BTC per share by capitalizing on its NAV premium, the stock has done the exact opposite, appreciating by more than 500% this year to date. In a sense, Saylor has found a “money glitch” in the system, as he is able to constantly dilute shareholders without having his stock depreciating - because investors care about an ever-increasing BTC per share and the market discounts he will be able to buy more Bitcoin in the future. Is this “glitch” infallible? No, it is not - and I will explain what can go wrong in the next section. What can go wrong with Saylor's strategy? (Risks to the “money glitch”) I want to define the risks of Saylor’s playbook before I go into the details of why I believe it can be a winning strategy long term. The reason is that I want to be very clear with readers: I think Saylor is entering uncharted territories, playing with Bitcoin as if it were already a globally accepted reserve asset. I believe Saylor’s scheme can collapse (to different extents) if either of the following two scenarios occur: In case, MicroStrategy’s NAV premium goes to 1x or below. In this case, Saylor won’t be able to keep increasing the BTC per share of MicroStrategy by issuing new shares. In this scenario, the company would keep existing and simply trade at 1x its Bitcoin holdings. It would result in a nominal loss for investors who entered MicroStrategy at above 1x NAV, and in MicroStrategy underperforming Bitcoin for a period of time. If Bitcoin does not mature into a reserve asset, and drops below $20,000 per coin. This could effectively bankrupt MicroStrategy, which is by now leveraged on its Bitcoin holdings. If readers believe there is a concrete chance of the second risk materializing, they should steer away from MicroStrategy. There is simply no point in investing in MSTR, Bitcoin, or any other Bitcoin proxy if you believe Bitcoin is a fad. This is also the main risk of entering MicroStrategy at any point in time, in my view. I believe most investors in MicroStrategy are believers in Bitcoin, which is also the reason why demand for MSTR shares is strong despite the constant shareholder dilution . While traditional investors wouldn’t care about “BTC per share” as a metric, MicroStrategy shareholders almost exclusively care about that metric. As long as BTC per share as a metric goes up, the glitch can keep going on. In the next section, I will explain why I think an NAV premium is justified, but this is still a concrete risk that investors entering MSTR at current levels should carefully consider. Why I think the NAV premium is justified - What’s a “Bitcoin bank”? The ultimate question about MicroStrategy is: why is the NAV premium justified? To answer this question, consider that MicroStrategy is one of the few publicly listed companies in the world to own Bitcoin, and by far the company that owns the most. MicroStrategy owns more than 330,000 BTC, equivalent to 1.5% of the total supply of Bitcoin. It is highly unlikely, in my view, that any other public or private company or financial institution will ever come close to having as much Bitcoin as MicroStrategy. If you consider the above a competitive advantage, I think it’s reasonable to believe that MicroStrategy should trade at some premium against its NAV holdings. If you do not consider MicroStrategy owning 1.5% of total Bitcoin supply as of 2024 a competitive advantage for the company, then it’s reasonable to believe MicroStrategy will eventually go back to trading at 1x its Bitcoin holdings. Personally, I do consider this a competitive advantage and I do consider a NAV premium justified. The reason has to do with the way Saylor is positioning its company. MicroStrategy rebranded itself as a “Bitcoin Development Company” earlier this year. The company is also becoming - in my view - the Bitcoin thought leader for corporations. On MicroStrategy’s website, users can download free whitepapers about corporate investments into Bitcoin and other topics linked to adopting Bitcoin. And this is without mentioning what Saylor is doing for Bitcoin, having become one of its strongest advocates with numerous public appearances. Beyond PR and advocating for Bitcoin, I also see MicroStrategy evolving into a “Bitcoin Bank.” In short, this means MicroStrategy can bridge the gap between Traditional Finance (TradFi) and Bitcoin, both by issuing financial instruments linked to its Bitcoin holdings and by consulting companies into adopting Bitcoin. In this sense, I see MicroStrategy operating similarly to how investment banks operate today when they consult companies in matters of Mergers & Acquisitions - charging fees both for consultancy as well as for issuance of bonds or other financial instruments to finance said M&As. Readers could argue that other companies - including traditional financial institutions - could do the exact same thing. While this is technically true, other financial institutions do not have their own Bitcoin holdings, and if they ever will, they are unlikely to ever have as much BTC as MicroStrategy’s. Not to mention, MicroStrategy also has far more credibility, in my view, considering how traditional banks have been very skeptical about Bitcoin until very recently if they are not still. This is where the competitive advantage for MicroStrategy comes into play and why its NAV is justified, in my opinion. As Bitcoin evolves, so may MicroStrategy’s offering as a Bitcoin bank. I believe an interesting evolution could be offering margin loans on Bitcoin holdings to other corporate entities. Assuming Bitcoin will grow into a global reserve asset, elevating itself as the soundest, deflationary form of money, selling Bitcoin to finance daily operations would not make logical sense. This is something I covered in one of my past articles about Bitcoin - arguing how, if my Bitcoin bull case takes place, Bitcoin won’t be able to operate as a global currency. The most logical thing to do would be to take a margin loan in fiat currency and take full benefit of the constant depreciation of fiat currencies in Bitcoin terms. In this context, corporations that followed MicroStrategy’s lead in adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset might eventually turn to MicroStrategy for margin loans on their BTC holdings. While this may seem far-fetched based on Bitcoin’s current status, it represents a potential scenario in the strong bull case for MicroStrategy. I will revisit the risks linked to this bull case in my second risk section later in this article. MSTR’s convertible debt offer indicates strong institutional demand An example of how MicroStrategy is evolving into a Bitcoin bank is the issuance of convertible debt notes. The last offering has been almost doubled from an initial $1.75 Billion to a final $2.6 Billion. This is especially impressive in my opinion, considering that these convertible notes carry a 0% interest rate at a time when T-Bills are yielding above 4%. And who is buying these notes? Listening to skeptics, you would expect buyers to be retail investors and other crypto actors. On the contrary, one of the buyers of these convertible notes was Allianz SE (ALIZF)(ALIZY), an established European insurance company. In other terms, we are already seeing established TradFi players deciding to purchase a convertible note that pays 0% interest in times of high interest rates , just because it’s backed by a significant Bitcoin reserve. Consider also that these notes are convertible into MicroStrategy’s shares at a price of $672.40, which is almost 60% higher than what the stock is trading at the time of writing this article. In my view, this indicates very strong interest in Bitcoin-linked financial instruments and the market is already discounting a Bitcoin bull run, as well as MicroStrategy trading at significantly higher levels than today. What’s a fair NAV premium? I expect volatility as the market figures it out I have already mentioned how I believe an NAV premium is justified for MicroStrategy. The problem is understanding what exactly is the level of premium that is justified. Looking at history, MicroStrategy traded at a higher premium than today in 2020 and 2021. This was at a time when the company just announced its BTC strategy and a Bitcoin bull market was in full swing. MSTR; NAV Premium, 2020 to date (mstr-tracker.com) Ultimately, I do not have a precise estimate of what a “fair” NAV Premium looks like for MicroStrategy. Based on history and on the fact that convertible notes indicate a potential 60% upside from current levels, I am however confident there is still room to grow. That’s especially true considering how, even if the premium stays as is (around roughly 3X), a bull case for Bitcoin could still drive significant appreciation of MSTR shares. This is also the reason why I decided not to sell any of my 150 shares in MicroStrategy, but rather give faith to Saylor and see how his company will evolve together with Bitcoin. Nevertheless, I do expect significant volatility going further. As Saylor keeps up with ATM offerings and its first convertible notes come to fruition, the stock will inevitably trade at vastly different premiums in the foreseeable future. Eventually, if Bitcoin ever truly matures as a global reserve asset, so will MicroStrategy as a Bitcoin bank. Don’t buy MSTR stock unless you believe in Bitcoin (reiterating risk) I have already outlined the risks with Saylor’s strategy at the beginning of this article. However, I want to reiterate that the ultimate risk with entering MicroStrategy is that Bitcoin does not end up maturing as a global reserve asset and plummets to new lows. This might very well happen if - for example - the upcoming Trump administration ends up not having the US starting a Bitcoin reserve and pivoting away from Bitcoin completely. While I deem this risk unlikely at this point in time, it is still something that investors should carefully consider before evaluating starting a position in MicroStrategy. My “BUY” rating is only valid assuming investors are willing to bet on Bitcoin maturing as a global reserve asset. In my view, this means Bitcoin could match gold’s market capitalization in the next 3 to 7 years - something I have covered in my Bitcoin articles in the past. Readers who do not believe in Bitcoin as an asymmetric bet on it becoming a new, superior form of global reserve asset should steer clear from MicroStrategy, in my opinion. Conclusion MicroStrategy is entering uncharted territories, trying to evolve from a company simply holding Bitcoin in its coffers to a full “Bitcoin bank,” offering financial instruments linked to its BTC holdings as well as consultancy services related to adopting Bitcoin. The strong institutional demand for its recent convertible note issuance suggests, in my view, that Saylor is succeeding in this ambitious evolution. I find this strategy compelling and have no plans to sell my 150 shares of MicroStrategy. In fact, I may consider adding to my position as I continue to see significant upside potential. I believe that owning 1.5% of the total Bitcoin supply in 2024 provides MicroStrategy with a unique competitive advantage, justifying its NAV premium. However, my bullish thesis assumes that Bitcoin will mature into a global reserve asset as the safest and soundest form of money. For investors who do not share this belief, I recommend avoiding MicroStrategy. But if you agree with this outlook, my suggestion is a BUY at current levels.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740004-microstrategy-could-become-first-bitcoin-bank-why-im-not-selling?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36826892.jpeg

The concept of ""Bitcoin Yield"" is flawed and misleading, as it relies on issuing equity at a premium without even matching a simple Bitcoin ETF. MicroStrategy faces significant refinancing risk, especially outside of crypto euphoria, which could lead to unfavorable debt terms or even bankruptcy. Investors should consider selling MSTR and replacing it with more reasonable Bitcoin exposure, if they must. There’s a lot of confusion around MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), namely, around the possibility that MicroStrategy has somehow found some new strategy which can provide it with value in excess of what its Bitcoin assets plus its business provide. This article will seek to wash away such confusion. First, The Business The least important thing about MicroStrategy is the actual business it is in. This business is enterprise analytics software, delivered as a package or as a web service. This business is stagnant to declining, and is currently not profitable. When this business was slightly larger, shrinking less and profitable, back in 2019, the market valued it at around $0.5 billion ($1 billion market cap, $0.5 billion net cash, thus the business itself was worth $0.5 billion). Considering the above, we can safely ignore MicroStrategy’s actual business, since MicroStrategy, on 256.3 million fully diluted shares at $422 has a $108.3 billion market capitalization, and the business at $0.5 billion represents less than 0.5% of that. The Bitcoin Treasury Of course, the real reason MicroStrategy trades at a $108.3 billion market cap isn’t its business. Instead, it relates to the large Bitcoin investment it has amassed since it started buying Bitcoin in August 2020. As of the most recent filing, MicroStrategy has bought 331,200 Bitcoins. Since Bitcoin is at $98,000 as I write this, these are worth $32.5 billion. But wait, this means MSTR actually trades at an extremely large premium to the Bitcoin it holds. After all, it trades at a $108.3 billion market cap, and it only holds $32.5 billion in Bitcoin. This can be seen in two ways: For MSTR to trade at the same value as the Bitcoin it holds, Bitcoin would have to be at $326,600 (up 233%). Or for MSTR to trade at the same value as the Bitcoin it holds, MSTR would have to be at $126.70 (down 70%) Of course, there is a narrative out there justifying the extremely large premium. This narrative revolves around the concept of “Bitcoin Yield”, or said another way, the supposed ability that MicroStrategy has of increasing the Bitcoin MSTR holders hold per share as time goes by, through a combination of issuing equity and debt. This, as we’ll see, is an absurd concept. The Bitcoin Yield The Bitcoin Yield, as defined by MicroStrategy, represents the % change, period-to-period, between MSTR’s bitcoin holdings and its diluted shares outstanding. Or, said another way, this is the % change in the bitcoin content per share. Obviously, the widespread idea is that since the bitcoin content per share (number of bitcoin per share) can increase over time, you can pay a premium today for the already-held Bitcoin. MicroStrategy makes use of this concept in its own presentations, and presents ""Bitcoin Yield"" as a KPI (Key Performance Indicator), showing its significance in attracting investor bees to the honey. MicroStrategy presentation MicroStrategy presentation But how and why does the bitcoin per share actually increase? It increases by issuing equity when MSTR is trading at a premium. Why? Because: When MSTR issues shares, it buys $1 in bitcoin per $1 of issued new stock. Yet, the already-issued shares trade for a lot less than $1 in bitcoin per $1 of already-issued shares (that’s why the stock trades at a premium to Bitcoin). Hence, when you mix the bitcoin from the newly issued shares with the “less bitcoin rich” existing shares, the whole cake now has slightly higher bitcoin per share. As a result, “Bitcoin Yield” will have been positive. But this is an absurd concept for two reasons: First, because it’s a circular concept – it justifies the stock trading at an irrational premium because if stock is issued at the irrational premium then the premium will be slightly smaller. This, of course, assumes it will always be possible to issue more stock in the future. Second, because the amount by which MSTR would have to dilute to get to $1 in bitcoin content per $1 is value per share would be infinite . Why? Because the end ratio as calculated above is a combination of shares which have $0.xx ratio and a $1.0 ratio, and this combination, as you issue more and more shares, tends to one, but never reaches it . Hence, it would be senseless to pay a premium for the future increase in bitcoin content per share over just buying a Bitcoin ETF which trades at $1:$1 to its bitcoin content per share, since the bitcoin content per share can never exceed $1:$1 through equity issuance at a premium! But wait, MicroStrategy can also issue debt! MicroStrategy has a second way of increasing the bitcoin content per share. It involves issuing debt, when possible at a low coupon and convertible into stock (so that the low coupon can even exist -- the reason why bond investors accept a low coupon on MSTR is for another day, but it's NOT related to Bitcoin or MSTR's strategy, instead being tied to riskless strategies on high-implied volatility stocks). Here, the magical trick is different. When MicroStrategy issues debt and buys bitcoin in the market with the proceeds, the proceeds are turned $1:$1 into bitcoin, but since no shares are diluted at issuance, the mere fact of issuing debt and buying bitcoin mechanically increases the bitcoin per share , and hence, produces “Bitcoin Yield”. But this is a sleigh of hand, in the sense that the “Bitcoin Yield” is calculated with gross bitcoin held, not with net bitcoin held. And of course, when MSTR issues debt, it buys $1 of bitcoin with $1 of debt, thus at the start and unless bitcoin goes up, it has added exactly $0 in net bitcoin value. Thus, issuing debt to buy bitcoin or the “investor” himself buying bitcoin on margin is rather similar. What Is MicroStrategy, Then? A Closed-End Fund The closest thing we can compare MicroStrategy with, is a closed-end Bitcoin fund. After all, at any given moment shareholders can only buy or sell MSTR – they can’t actually subscribe or redeem the underlying, exactly like it happens with a closed-end fund. And MSTR can trade both at a premium, like now, or at a discount, to the underlying. Furthermore, a closed-end fund can also issue more preferred shares or debt to buy more underlying. Yes, closed-end funds can trade both at a premium, like MSTR, and at a discount … like MSTR. The current crop of euphoric shareholders might not know it, but MSTR has, indeed, already shown it was possible to trade at a discount. In closed-end funds, outside of euphorias, the normal is to trade at or below NAV. And so it was for MSTR: MSTR-tracker.com Note that in the chart above there are observations of up to a 49% discount in 2022, and a 15% discount already within 2024. Basically, outside of straight-up Bitcoin euphoria, it hasn’t taken long for MSTR to converge to its NAV or even below it. We have, of course, examples of other closed-end funds behaving exactly the same. For instance: The GBTC example The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) traded both at a large premium to Bitcoin NAV, including over 100%, and a large discount to NAV (-49%, must like MSTR) when Bitcoin lost its allure. Ultimately, it converged to NAV once it became an open-end ETF. I wrote about this at the time ( I , II ). ycharts.com The LTCN example Like MSTR and GBTC, the Grayscale Litecoin Trust ( OTCQX:LTCN ) also traded at extremes, which included premiums of over 1,000%. However, these were the result of very low liquidity and very few available LTCN shares to trade. And again, after the euphoria was gone and more shares were available to trade, it, too, managed to trade at a discount of more than 60%. I, too, wrote on this situation ( I , II ). Grayscale We have thus established that it is possible, likely even, that MSTR will once again trade at its NAV / value of the bitcoin it holds. This is likely to happen as soon as crypto / Bitcoin euphoria dies a bit, just like it did cyclically in the past. Of course, in the present market it’s even more possible than in the past because the present market now has several ETFs which hold Bitcoin and trade at NAV, like GBTC or the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ). There is something else which can happen to MSTR, besides trading at or below NAV, though. MicroStrategy’s Refinancing Risk Since MicroStrategy has issued debt, and since MicroStrategy doesn’t produce much cash from operations or has much cash in its balance sheet (it turns everything into Bitcoin), MicroStrategy has refinancing risk when some of its debt matures. This refinancing risk isn’t acute during times of crypto euphoria. But it can be, outside those times. And crypto euphoria is often not very long-lasting. If a debt maturity happens outside of crypto euphoria, here are the avenues available to MicroStrategy to be able to pay the maturing debt: Selling BTC outside a crypto euphoria (so at a bad moment). Selling MSTR outside of a crypto euphoria (so at a bad moment, selling MSTR likely below NAV) Refinancing debt at unfavorable terms. We actually have an example of what refinancing debt at unfavorable terms means for MicroStrategy. Back in June 2021, MSTR was forced to issue debt. That’s when the market, fearing the worst, sold MSTR down to a near-50% discount to NAV. Here are the conditions that MSTR then got to issue just $500 million of debt: A 6.125% coupon, at a time the FED funds rate was 0% and the 10-year was at 0.7%. Senior secured debt, secured by all of its 92,079 bitcoins. With Bitcoin then at roughly $35,500, that meant the debt was secured at an LTV (Loan-To-Value) of 15.3%. This shows how much the creditors “wanted” bitcoin as a collateral. So there it is, if MSTR is forced to refinance debt at a non-euphoric time, history has already shown us that such could happen at a time when MSTR is trading at a 40%+ discount to NAV (so selling shares would be incredibly dilutive to NAV), Bitcoin is kind of crashing (it went lower still, though) and whatever debt can be issued will be under extremely unfavorable conditions. Worse still, had MSTR’s NAV (bitcoin – debt value) been, at the time, significantly lower, it’s likely that no creditor would want to finance MSTR. If that happened, MSTR could simply face bankruptcy. This is an unlikely, but possible, event, with MicroStrategy’s current strategy. Some Scenarios Here are some scenarios for MicroStrategy, if it converges to its bitcoin NAV , for people to have a better understanding of what it means to buy MSTR currently: Bitcoin falls 80% to $19,600 . MSTR currently has $7bn in net debt, the bitcoin it holds, under a scenario of a 80% drop in Bitcoin, would be worth around $7.1bn (I assume the recently issued $3 billion in debt has been used to buy $3 billion in BTC). In a best-case scenario MSTR would drop 93.2% to $27.7. In a worst-case scenario, if a debt maturity happens, MSTR would be facing potential bankruptcy. Bitcoin falls 50% to $49,000 . MSTR falls 83.6% to $69.2. In a worst-case scenario, if a debt maturity happens, all of MSTR’s bitcoin gets offered as collateral to issue secured debt at an 8%+ coupon. Bitcoin stays the same . MSTR drops 70% to $126.6. Bitcoin goes up 100% . MSTR drops 37% to $265.0. Bitcoin goes up 200% . MSTR drops 4% to $403.3. In short, if, as it has done in the past in the absence of a crypto euphoria, MSTR’s value returns to its bitcoin NAV (never mind below, which it has also done in the past by a good margin), current MSTR shareholders need Bitcoin to go up more than 200% for them to even break even . This isn’t a rational position to be in. Conclusion MicroStrategy’s stock is best seen as a closed-end fund. It looks like one, it walks like one, it quacks like one. It has traded both at a premium to its NAV and at a discount to its NAV, even in the recent past. It has traded at a discount or close to NAV the entire time, since it has been buying Bitcoin, where the crypto market wasn’t euphoric. The Bitcoin yield concept is not rational. It can be shown that through equity issuance alone, it’s impossible for MSTR to even surpass the content per share of a normal Bitcoin ETF ($1 of bitcoin per $1 of stock price). Indeed, using this concept in marketing is highly misleading and might one day attract regulatory scrutiny. All it takes for MSTR to be a disaster for its investors, is for MSTR to again trade at or below NAV, like it has done plenty in the past. Disaster can strike if and when MSTR faces refinancing risk for its existing debt, outside of a crypto euphoria. There has already been an example of what this means in the past, with the need to issue debt at unfavorable rates in a favorable rate environment, secured by all of MSTR’s bitcoin. This isn’t even the worst-case scenario. It is possible, but unlikely, for MSTR to go bankrupt if Bitcoin falls enough at the wrong time (when debt matures).

It’s like the heartbeat of the crypto ecosystem, providing a snapshot of a coin's value and its position in the market. As I explored further, I realised how this figure helps investors gauge the potential and stability of various digital currencies. Understanding crypto market capitalisation opened my eyes to its role in shaping investment strategies. It’s fascinating to see how it influences decisions, from identifying emerging cryptocurrencies to assessing the giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This metric offers a unique perspective, allowing me to make informed choices and stay ahead in the fast-paced crypto world. Key Takeaways Definition and Importance: Crypto market capitalisation is a vital metric that measures a cryptocurrency's total market value, calculated by multiplying the current market price by the circulating supply. It plays a crucial role in assessing a cryptocurrency's market position and potential stability. Investment Strategy Insight: Understanding market capitalisation is key to shaping effective crypto investment strategies. It helps investors identify stable large-cap coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as promising mid-cap cryptocurrencies. Calculation and Monitoring: Calculating market capitalisation involves a simple formula of price times supply. Platforms like CoinMarketCap provide essential tools for tracking real-time market cap fluctuations, enabling informed decision-making. Influential Factors: Market supply, demand, media coverage, and regulatory changes significantly impact crypto market capitalisation. Staying informed about these factors can guide investors in predicting market trends. Comparative Analysis: Comparing market caps provides insights into the crypto landscape. Recognising the differences between large-cap and emerging cryptocurrencies can optimise investment strategies by balancing risk and rewards. Understanding Crypto Market Capitalization Grasping crypto market capitalisation is essential for anyone dabbling in digital currencies. It serves as a lens through which I evaluate a cryptocurrency's potential. Here's how it works and why it matters. Definition of Crypto Market Capitalization Crypto market capitalisation measures a cryptocurrency's total market value. You find this number by multiplying the current market price by the circulating supply. It's a bit like calculating the total worth of a company, but instead of shares, you've got tokens. For me, it's a handy way to gauge a coin's scale and relevance in the crypto world. Understanding this often guides my investment decisions. Importance of Market Capitalization in Crypto Market capitalisation reveals a cryptocurrency's dominance and popularity. I often look for higher values, which usually indicate stability and less volatility. Large-cap coins, like Bitcoin, tend to weather market ups and downs. Knowing this helps me build a solid digital asset portfolio with an eye on long-term growth. The insight I've gained from understanding market cap drives smarter crypto choices. Calculating Crypto Market Capitalization Calculating crypto market capitalisation is straightforward. I'm often amazed by how this process reveals a cryptocurrency's true market presence. Method For Calculating Market Cap To find a cryptocurrency's market cap, multiply its current market price by its circulating supply. This method provides a snapshot of its market value. For instance, if a coin's price is £100 with 10 million coins circulating, its market cap is £1 billion. This formula helps investors analyse crypto assets. Tools For Tracking Market Capitalization I use platforms like CoinMarketCap to stay updated on crypto market capitalisation. It's a reliable tool providing real-time data. Websites like these offer insights into market dynamics, sparking interest and excitement. With such tools, I can easily monitor fluctuations and trends in cryptocurrency values, aiding investment decisions. Factors Influencing Crypto Market Capitalization Crypto market capitalisation shifts depending on various factors. Understanding these can help predict potential trends. Market Supply and Demand Supply and demand play key roles in market capitalisation. The cryptocurrency's circulating supply affects its market cap directly. When coin supply increases, if demand doesn't match, the price can drop, lowering the market cap. Demand is driven by investor interest and user adoption. High demand boosts prices, enhancing market cap significantly. This intricate link between supply and demand constantly impacts the crypto landscape. Impact of Media and News Media coverage sways crypto values. Positive news stories often increase investor enthusiasm, raising market caps. I recall a major news outlet once covering Bitcoin's rise, causing its price to soar. A single headline can shape market perception dramatically. Conversely, negative news may trigger fear, leading to sell-offs and reduced market caps. Staying informed about media trends is essential for making sound investment decisions. Influence of Regulatory Changes Regulatory changes can reshape the crypto market. Governments introducing favourable laws can encourage investment, boosting market caps. For instance, I remember when a country legalised crypto trading, causing a surge in prices. However, strict regulations may deter investors, negatively impacting market caps. Monitoring regulatory environments helps predict how they might affect market directions. Comparing Market Capitalizations In Crypto When I look at market capitalisations in crypto, I see a powerful tool for understanding the landscape. It helps me differentiate between established giants and up-and-coming challengers, allowing me to optimise my investment strategy effectively. Largest Cryptocurrencies By Market Cap Large-cap cryptocurrencies are the titans of the crypto world. Bitcoin, with its £1.34 trillion market cap, has proven itself a safe haven for investors seeking stability. Ethereum is another major player. It holds a market cap of £318 billion, offering secure footing in a volatile market. When I invest in these, I feel a sense of security knowing I'm placing my money in established projects. They're the bedrock of any crypto portfolio. These large-caps, in my opinion, offer less risk and decent returns over time compared to their smaller counterparts. Emerging Cryptocurrencies With Growing Market Caps Mid-cap cryptocurrencies offer intriguing potential. They're not as stable as large-caps, but they hold promise. When I see an emerging crypto like Solana rising, I feel excitement about its growth. These options help diversify my portfolio. Mid-caps often cater to niche markets, providing specific solutions. This aspect makes them valuable. Historically, some mid-caps have outperformed larger coins, rewarding investors. Tracking their market cap growth helps me identify opportunities early. Investing in these requires more risk tolerance. However, the potential rewards make it worthwhile for me. I approach them with an eye for innovation and scalability. Strategies For Using Market Capitalization In Investment Exploring market capitalisation helps to create effective crypto investment strategies. Understanding this metric can guide me in evaluating opportunities and managing risks. Evaluating Investment Opportunities Market capitalisation helps identify promising investments. Large-cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin assure stability. They're reliable for long-term growth. I find mid-caps have exciting potential. They offer untapped possibilities but come with increased risk. Keeping their market trends in view lets me spot promising newcomers. By focusing on capitalisation, I can weigh stability against growth opportunities. This helps me diversify my portfolio effectively. Analysing Risks And Volatility Market capitalisation reveals risk levels. Larger market caps often mean less volatility. Investing in large-cap cryptocurrencies usually offers security. Mid-cap cryptos interest me for higher rewards. Yet, they're riskier with unpredictable price changes. Watching fluctuations helps me mitigate potential losses. It equips me to navigate through crypto uncertainties with confidence. Balancing between caps helps me control risk exposure. Understanding market caps lets me optimise returns while managing volatility. Conclusion Understanding crypto market capitalisation is a game-changer for any investor looking to navigate the digital currency landscape. It offers a comprehensive view of a cryptocurrency's value and market standing, enabling smarter investment choices. By leveraging this metric, I can pinpoint emerging opportunities and assess the stability of well-established coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Market capitalisation isn't just about numbers; it's about predicting trends and managing risks effectively. With the right insights, I can build a diversified portfolio that balances growth potential and stability. Embracing this approach equips me with the tools to make informed decisions, ensuring I stay ahead in the ever-evolving crypto market.

BTC is marginally down over the past 24 hours but registered a substantial decline over the weekend and dipped to a low of $95,816 late on Sunday before recovering. While BTC reached historic levels during its rally, analysts have noted signs of market exhaustion and potential consolidation around $100,000. Several major cryptocurrencies have also declined over the past 24 hours with the most notable being Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). ETH is down almost 1% over the past 24 hours and SOL is down just over 1% as buyers look to keep it above $250. Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT). Speaking about BTC’s struggles to go above $100,000, ChangeNOW CMO Pauline Shangett stated, “The rapid ascent to $99,655 has stretched Bitcoin's momentum indicators, signaling potential market exhaustion. While long-term fundamentals remain intact, short-term volatility and profit-taking are to be expected. The broader crypto market appears to be mirroring Bitcoin's cooling off. Coins like Ethereum and Solana are also under pressure, reflecting cautious sentiment among buyers after a strong rally.” Crypto Market Hit By Liquidation Wave The crypto market was hit by a liquidation tsunami as Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted below $96,000 before recovering. However, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has still been unable to go above the $100,000 price level. The drop led to one of the most significant crypto liquidations in the past six months, with $500 million worth of crypto positions wiped out. Long liquidations accounted for a hefty $379 million, while short liquidations accounted for $125 million, according to data sourced from CoinGlass. 197,083 traders were liquidated, with the largest liquidation ($13 million) on Binance. BTC and ETH made up a significant chunk of the liquidations, accounting for $121 million worth of positions. Prominent altcoins, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP) , and Stellar (XLM) reported significant liquidations, with 34.20 million, $30.27 million, and $18.95 million wiped out. The drop comes after a substantial rally reported by several altcoins, such as XLM and DOGE. XLM rallied over 50% on November 23-24, and DOGE hit levels not seen since May 2021. NFTs Register $158M Weekly Sales Volume Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) continued their strong weekly sales volumes despite declining marginally. Data from NFT tracker CryptoSlam showed NFTs recorded a sales volume of around $158 million over the past week, a 12.7% decrease compared to the previous week when they recorded $181 million in weekly sales. Despite the decline, weekly trading volume is above its record at the beginning of November. NFTs registered weekly sales volumes of only $93 million between November 4 and 10. Ethereum led in sales volume, recording $49 million in sales, and Bitcoin ranked a close second with $43 million in sales. Meanwhile, Solana maintained its rank as the third-highest in sales volumes for NFTs, with $23.9 million in weekly sales. However, this was a 9% drop compared to the previous week. Polygon, Immutable, Mythos Chain, and BNB Chain recorded $35.8 million in weekly sales volume. However, Solana led in the number of NFT buyers with 185,000 buyers for the week, an increase of 57% compared to the week prior. The numbers suggest NFTs are on track to close November positively. NFTs recorded $356 million in sales volume in October, an 18% increase compared to September. Current figures suggest consistent interest despite slight fluctuations. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis The Bitcoin (BTC) rally has stalled during recent sessions, losing momentum at a critical level and stopping just shy of $100,000, with sellers pushing the price lower marginally. The loss of momentum can be attributed to traders assessing if optimism from President-elect Donald Trump’s support for crypto is becoming stretched. The asset fell to a low of $95,776 on Sunday before rising to its current levels. Matt Maley, Chief Market Strategist at Miller Tabak and Co, stated, “Investors are worried Bitcoin will have to take a breather now that it has tested the $100,000 level. Bullishness around the cryptocurrency is getting extreme.” Trump has promised crypto-friendly regulation and create a strategic Bitcoin stockpile. However, the timeline and feasibility of some promises remain in doubt. “I’m seeing an increasing skew to the sell side as we near the $100,000 mark. This suggests we may experience consolidation around this level in the near term before a sustained breakthrough above it.” The Bitcoin price chart shows BTC losing momentum after reaching a peak of $99,317 on Friday. BTC was bullish the previous week as it surged towards $100,000, beginning with an increase of 1.17% on Monday to go above $90,000 and settle at $90,509. Bitcoin bulls retained control on Tuesday as the price rose by 2.15% and settled at $92,457. Wednesday saw BTC register an increase of almost 2% and settle at $94,204. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC rose nearly 4% to go above $95,000 and settle at $97,784. Bullish momentum waned on Friday as BTC approached the $100,000 price level. BTC reached an intraday high of $99,317 before declining and settling at $98,355, registering a marginal increase of 0.58%. Source: TradingView The weekend began with BTC registering a notable decline on Saturday, falling by 1.26% and settling at $97,113. Sellers drove BTC to an intraday low of $94,838 on Sunday as selling pressure increased. However, BTC recovered from this level as sellers lost momentum, rising 0.80% and settling at $97,891. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers and sellers look to influence price action. Analysts believe it's only a matter of time before BTC crosses $100,000 and are confident it will happen by the end of November. However, whether it can sustain itself above this level remains to be seen. If BTC goes below $100,000, we could see a correction that could take the price as low as $80,000. For now, the market waits for BTC’s ascent past $100,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to go above $3,400 as it faces significant selling pressure at this level. The altcoin has been trading between $3,000 and $3,400 since November 11 and is down by 1.21% over the past 24 hours. However, despite the recent wobble, ETH is up almost 8% over the past week. ETH started the previous week on a bullish note, rebounding from a low of $3,051 to register an increase of 4.37% and settle at $3,209. However, it fell back in the red on Tuesday, dropping by 3.13% and settling at $3,109. Bearish sentiment persisted on Wednesday as ETH dropped by 1.25% and settled at $3,070. Source: TradingView Despite declining on Wednesday, ETH registered a stunning rally on Thursday, rising by 9.44% and settling at $3,360 after reaching an intraday high of $3,388. Buyers attempted to go above $3,400 on Friday as ETH reached an intraday high of $3,427. However, it fell back from this level, dropping 0.96% and settling at $3,328. The weekend saw buying activity increase on Saturday as ETH rose to an intraday high of $3,502. However, buyers lost momentum, and ETH fell below $3,400, settling at $3,396 after registering an increase of just over 2%. Sellers returned to the market on Sunday as ETH fell to a low of $3,286 before recovering and settling at $3,362, a drop of 1.01% compared to Saturday. ETH fell to a low of $3,301 during the current session. However, it has recovered and is currently up by 0.69% and trading at $3,385. Buyers are looking to push ETH above the $3,400 price level. If ETH crosses this level, we could see a rally to $3,500 and beyond. On the other hand, if sellers take control and drive ETH below $3,000, it could drop to $2,850. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) has registered a substantial decline over the past few sessions as it struggles to go above $260, with sellers looking to drive the price below $250. SOL has also been experiencing significant volatility, beginning the previous week with an increase of 1.04% to settle at $239. However, the price fell back in the red after rising to an intraday high of $247 on Tuesday, registering a decline of 0.89% and settling at $237. Bearish sentiment persisted on Wednesday as SOL fell by 0.97% and settled at $235. Despite the selling pressure, SOL rallied on Thursday, rising almost 9% to move above $250 and settle at $256. SOL encountered considerable volatility on Friday as buyers and sellers attempted to wrest control, with the price registering a marginal increase.

Selling pressure intensified on Sunday as SOL dropped to an intraday low of $241. However, buyers propped up the price from this level as SOL reclaimed $250 and settled at $253. The current session sees SOL marginally up as buyers and sellers look to take control. Sellers will look to drive SOL below $250. On the other hand, if SOL rallies past $260, we could see a surge to $280-$290. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) has declined during the current session as it struggles to go above $0.45. DOGE began the previous week positively, registering an increase of 1.37% and settling at $0.371. The price rallied to an intraday high of $0.420 on Tuesday before dropping and settling at $0.391.

Polkadot (DOT) Price Analysis Polkadot (DOT) has registered an incredible rally that has seen the price surge past $10 as DOT exploded to move above crucial resistance levels. DOT registered a substantial jump on Monday, rising almost 11% and settling at $6. However, it fell back in the red on Tuesday, dropping by 3.33% to $5.80. DOT saw considerable volatility on Wednesday as buyers attempted to reclaim the $6 level. DOT rose to an intraday high of $6.12 before falling back to register a drop of 1.21% and settle at $5.73.

I've seen how the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency has captured the imagination of many, including myself. The dynamic nature of digital currencies offers a unique blend of innovation and opportunity that’s hard to resist. As governments worldwide work to establish frameworks for these digital assets, there's a palpable sense of excitement and anticipation. I find it fascinating how these regulations aim to provide clarity and security, paving the way for broader adoption while protecting investors. The balance between innovation and regulation is crucial, and it’s a journey I’m eager to follow. Understanding the emerging rules and guidelines is essential for anyone involved in the crypto space. It’s not just about compliance; it’s about embracing the potential of a more structured environment that fosters growth and trust. As we delve deeper into this landscape, the possibilities seem endless. Key Takeaways Dynamic Regulatory Environment: The crypto regulatory landscape is rapidly evolving with governments globally working to establish frameworks that balance innovation with investor protection. Key Global Bodies: Organisations like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) play pivotal roles in shaping consistent global crypto regulations, focusing on both innovation and consumer safety. Regional Approaches: There is a diverse range of regulatory frameworks across different regions, from the collaborative initiatives in the European Union to Asia's varied approaches, tailored to each country's economic objectives. Challenges and Opportunities: Navigating the complex and fragmented regulatory environment is challenging for stakeholders, but it also presents opportunities for strategic growth and innovation in the crypto space. Future Trends: Emerging technologies like DeFi and NFTs are reshaping the landscape, prompting regulatory bodies to adapt. International cooperation hints at a future where global regulatory collaboration enhances market stability and cross-border transactions. Understanding The Crypto Regulatory Landscape Insights into U.S. Regulatory Bodies I've found that understanding crypto involve key U.S. bodies. The SEC treats many crypto offerings as securities. Ensuring compliance aligns investors' protection with existing laws. The CFTC takes charge of commodities, overseeing specific cryptocurrency trading aspects, especially derivatives. Complexity and Evolution Navigating this landscape involves keeping pace with rapid changes. Each regulatory body sets its standards, creating a complex web of rules. Staying informed is challenging yet essential. Engaging with updates keeps me ahead, ensuring I embrace growth opportunities in the crypto industry. Embracing International Cooperation International collaboration shapes global crypto regulations. Different nations share strategies to harmonise rules, foster broader adoption, and protect users. Learning about such efforts excites me. It's encouraging to see worldwide understanding promoting stability and innovation for digital assets. Evolution Of Cryptocurrency Regulations The journey of cryptocurrency regulations has been transformative. Governments worldwide are increasingly shaping the rules of this burgeoning digital realm. Early Days Of Crypto Regulations In the early days, crypto remained mostly unregulated. Bitcoin's launch in 2009 marked a new era. It felt like the Wild West with no clear rules. Fraud and money laundering risks were high. As cryptos grew, authorities took notice. Frameworks became crucial to protect users and ensure financial system integrity. Recent Developments In Crypto Legislation Recently, regulatory efforts have accelerated. Bodies like the SEC in the US impose stricter guidelines. Nations work to harmonise global crypto laws. Now, frameworks focus on investor safety and market transparency. I'm optimistic about this trend. It promises growth and secures the digital asset future. Key Global Regulatory Bodies Understanding the global crypto regulatory landscape involves some key bodies. They play crucial roles in shaping the rules needed for crypto's safe growth. Role Of The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) sets global standards for anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT). I'm impressed with how FATF's guidelines help countries develop legal structures to manage risks with cryptocurrencies. This promotes global cooperation, enhancing financial security. I appreciate that its regular updates ensure regulations evolve with the industry's rapid changes, reducing potential vulnerabilities. FATF's work is essential in creating a shared approach to digital asset oversight, encouraging transparency and trust. Influence Of The European Securities And Markets Authority (ESMA) The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) oversees the EU's financial markets. I'm pleased by ESMA's proactive stance on digital assets, aiding in unifying crypto-market regulations across member states. Their guidelines clarify which tokens qualify as financial instruments, increasing market predictability. This directly encourages safer investment environments and protects consumers. ESMA's collaboration with national authorities strengthens regulatory frameworks, making the European crypto landscape more consistent and secure. Their insight helps balance innovation and safety, supporting the sector's sustainable growth. Regional Approaches To Crypto Regulations Exploring the world of crypto regulations can be fascinating. It's intriguing to see how various regions tailor their policies to balance innovation and security. The United States And Its Regulatory Framework The U.S. regulatory scene for cryptocurrency involves multiple agencies. The SEC and CFTC play vital roles. SEC handles crypto as securities, requiring investor protection. CFTC oversees crypto derivatives as commodities. Navigating these can seem complex, yet it's crucial for protection and innovation. The SEC and CFTC set the stage for a safer crypto future, ensuring fair and transparent markets. European Union's Crypto Asset Regulations The EU takes a unified, proactive approach. ESMA seeks to clarify crypto's place in financial markets. This boosts confidence and predictability. EU's regulations emphasise investor protection across member states. Policies aim to harmonise rules, fostering growth and innovation. These initiatives create a stable environment for digital assets in the region, encouraging wider adoption. Asia's Diverse Regulatory Landscape Asia's crypto landscape is incredibly diverse. Countries devise unique frameworks tailored to their economic goals. Nations like Japan excel with robust crypto laws, offering investor security. In contrast, China implements stringent restrictions. The diversity ensures innovation persists amid careful scrutiny. Asia's regulatory environment showcases a dynamic balance between progress and caution. Challenges Facing The Crypto Regulatory Landscape Regulatory landscapes can overwhelm even seasoned finance professionals. Navigating the crypto realm is daunting, but it's crucial for digital asset evolution and investor protection. Navigating Regulatory Uncertainty Understanding cryptocurrency regulation requires patience and precise understanding. My journey in the crypto sphere helped me appreciate how diverse these regulations are. Global regulators often don't agree on best practices. This leads to a maze of rules impacting crypto adoption. Enthusiasts and businesses meet this confusion head-on every day. The fragmented approaches cause delays and misinterpretations in compliance. With cryptocurrency technology evolving swiftly, regulatory clarity remains elusive. Despite these challenges, I've seen how staying informed enables strategic decision-making. Balancing Innovation And Consumer Protection Safeguarding consumers and encouraging innovation is tricky. Cryptocurrencies thrive in innovative environments but pose unique risks. When I first encountered the regulatory aspect, it was clear authorities face a balancing act. Protecting users without stifling growth requires nuanced frameworks. For example, stringent laws might deter fraud but slow down creative projects. In my view, the ideal system embraces innovation while ensuring security. Continuous dialogue between regulators, developers, and users can foster this balance. The crypto space constantly inspires me with its commitment to evolving solutions. Future Trends In Crypto Regulation The crypto regulatory landscape is thrilling. I often find myself amazed by the rapid changes and possibilities it offers. Let's explore what lies ahead. Emerging Technologies And Their Impact Blockchain innovation excites me most. It boosts decentralised finance (DeFi), which challenges traditional banking. Its potential to lower costs and increase accessibility is impressive. Smart contracts automate transactions. They reduce human error and enhance security. These technologies attract regulators' attention. They're wary of potential risks, but they can't ignore the benefits. NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are redefining ownership. Regulators debate how to categorise them. It's a dynamic space that fascinates me. As these technologies evolve, so will regulations. I anticipate a future where rules balance innovation and protection effectively. This evolving landscape keeps me on my toes. Prospects For International Regulatory Collaboration International collaboration in crypto regulation excites me. Countries like Japan lead by crafting robust frameworks. Their efforts inspire others. Global coordination could ease cross-border transactions, increasing accessibility. This can foster innovation and trust. The G20 and FATF initiatives show promise. I hope for streamlined guidelines that bolster investor confidence, giving the sector stability. Europe shows unity with the EU crypto directive, which promotes transparency. I admire how bodies like ESMA set standards to guide member states. It's a step towards harmony. Watching these collaborative efforts grow is exciting. I envision a world where global crypto governance enhances security. Conclusion Navigating the crypto regulatory landscape is both challenging and exhilarating as we witness a dynamic shift towards more structured frameworks. This journey holds immense potential for fostering innovation and trust in digital assets. As regulations evolve, they aim to strike a balance between safeguarding investors and nurturing technological advancements. The collaborative efforts of global regulatory bodies are crucial in harmonising rules and enhancing security. I'm optimistic about the future of crypto governance and the opportunities it presents for growth and stability. Staying informed and engaged in this ever-changing environment is essential for seizing the possibilities that lie ahead. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42416287,c51378bf-e821-4d62-9882-947357c8acd1,1732539959,"Bitcoin Options Worth $9B Expire Friday, Traders May be Thankful for the Post-Thanksgiving Volatility","The crypto market should see a pick up in volatility at the end of this week, as the monthly (BTC) and ether (ETH) options contracts are set to expire this Friday. This comes a day after the U.S. bank holiday Thanksgiving, giving traders an opportunity to be thankful for a potential increase in volatility.   BTC and ETH options contracts worth $9.4 billion and $1.3 billion will expire on the trading exchange Deribit at 08:00 UTC on Nov. 29. An option allows the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset as a specific price within a certain time period.   According to Deribit data, breaking down the $9.4 billion in notional value in bitcoin that is set to expire on Friday. Over $4.2 billion (45%) of the total notional value is ""in-the-money"" (ITM). Out of this $4.2 billion, almost 80% of them are calls that are ITM. A call that is ITM is a strike price that is below the current market price, while the opposite can be said for ITM puts that are strikes above the spot price.  As a large amount of call options are ITM this could see a lot of volatility as we get closer to the options expiry, as investors look to close their bets and profit substantially. The volatility was seen last month on Oct. 25, which was the last Friday of the month, which saw a 3% decrease in bitcoin's as over $4 billion of options expired.   Andre Dragosch, European head of research at Bitwise, told CoinDesk that the majority of put open interest is concentrated in the $70,000 strike price, but sees that as a very unlikely outcome.   ""As far as the expiry on Friday is concerned you see most of open interest concentrated in calls around $82,000 strike and $70,000 strike in puts. Max pain theory would suggest that we would move towards this range between $70,000 - $82,000 but this seems to be relatively unlikely. My base case remains for some sort of temporary consolidation amid elevated sentiment and high profit-taking but I don’t think that we would move towards this range in anytime soon since supply scarcity is still very much pronounced"".  Diving into the out of the money (OTM) options, they are significantly dominated by puts. Out of the total notional value that is OTM is $5.2 billion (55%) and over $4.1 billion (98%) is in OTM puts. Traders were either hedging against downside risk, or making bearish bets that will most likely not materialize. Leaving investors with significant unrealized losses, that will put less downwards pressure on the market.  Dragosch believes that most of the concentration in puts are likely hedges and not bearish bets.   ""BTC open interest is disproportionately concentrated in puts as the put-call open interest ratio is still hovering near the highest level since March 2024. The majority of these expiries will likely rolled over into puts as most of this open interest represents hedges and not outright downside bets in my opinion"", Dragosch argues.   As bitcoin's price is above $98,000 significantly higher than the max pain price of $78,000. The max pain price is the price point where the option holders experience the greatest losses, while the market makers who are the option sellers achieve maximum profit. Due to the large difference between max pain and the current bitcoin spot price, this is leaving many call options deep in the money. In addition, as the price is so far ahead of the max pain price, market makers may be forced to hedge by purchasing bitcoin which could fuel a further rally potentially taking bitcoin to the psychological level of $100,000.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/25/bitcoin-options-worth-9-b-expire-friday-traders-may-be-thankful-for-the-post-thanksgiving-volatility,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/678de7662a2d063a2585f232f7f028831d0386f7-2400x1200.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Over time, I've learnt how these fluctuations shape investment strategies. Defining Market Volatility Market volatility in crypto refers to rapid price changes within short timespans. Unlike traditional markets, cryptocurrency sees high standard deviations. This unpredictable nature draws in risk-takers. To me, it creates a dynamic, ever-evolving space filled with possibilities. Observing these shifts often reminds me of why I ventured into this domain. Unique Factors Influencing Crypto Volatility High-frequency price dynamics play a big role. Positive market returns at high frequencies surprisingly boost volatility. Data from 2020 to 2022 highlights this trend, especially in 2022. These unique patterns redefine conventional market wisdom. I've seen how these dynamics, unlike any other sector, transform trading approaches and investment decisions. Historical Trends in Crypto Market Volatility Cryptocurrencies have reshaped financial landscapes, with volatility playing a pivotal role. Seeing markets surge and dip has been both exhilarating and challenging, offering insights into the burgeoning world of digital assets. Key Moments of High Volatility Bitcoin's annualised volatility once breached 200%. Such extremes exemplify early market irrationality. Witnessing Bitcoin's wild price swings was unforgettable. Another notable moment was in 2017 when the cryptocurrency rallied from under $1,000 to nearly $20,000, then plummeted. These dramatic shifts reflect underlying market forces and investors' psychological factors. The early days of crypto trading had me on edge, always on high alert. Comparing Volatility of Different Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin's volatility has historically dominated headlines. However, Ripple and Litecoin have shown unpredictable price movements too. Each cryptocurrency's distinct technology and market adoption impact its volatility. For instance, Ethereum's reliance on demand for smart contracts can intensify its price swings. Observing these differences is essential for assessing risk and identifying trading opportunities. Understanding volatility helps in aligning strategy with particular markets. Causes of Crypto Market Volatility Crypto market volatility fascinates me with its endless twists. It's not just market sentiment, regulations also play their roles. Technology - both its advancements and its challenges - reshapes and fuels the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrencies. Influence of Market Sentiment Sentiment shifts can make or break crypto prices. Positive news often sparks buying frenzies, elevating prices to new highs. However, fear or disappointment, like failed projects, can lead to abrupt sell-offs. I’ve seen optimism drive Bitcoin’s surges. Investor psychology drives volatility in unprecedented ways. Impact of Regulatory Changes Regulations regularly impact crypto markets. Announcements, like country-wide bans or acceptance, can create panic or optimism. I’ve followed how China’s crackdowns spurred significant sell-offs. Each regulatory change alters trust and attraction. It's thrilling to see markets respond swiftly to government decisions. Role of Technology and Innovation Technological advances constantly shape crypto volatility. Innovations, such as smart contracts, often boost demand and prices. Yet, issues like blockchain security threats can cause drops. I'm enthralled by how developments like Ethereum's updates shift landscapes. Adapting to these changes offers rewarding opportunities. Consequences of Crypto Market Volatility Crypto market volatility can be both a boon and a bane. It dictates the potential returns and risks in the cryptocurrency space. Opportunities for Traders and Investors Crypto volatility offers numerous opportunities for traders and investors. I often find myself buzzing with excitement when volatile markets expand profit margins. Price swings enable one to buy low and sell high, maximising gains. With arbitrage chances, one can exploit price differences across exchanges. I see derivatives as another tool, allowing hedging against unexpected market downturns. Sometimes, taking advantage of short-term fluctuations results in lucrative rewards. Engaging with educational platforms and forums keeps one informed and ready to act quickly. Risks Associated with High Volatility However, high volatility introduces several risks. It's frightening when drastic price drops lead to heavy losses. Investors might face liquidation issues if they use leverage. Price swings can also lead to emotional decision-making causing harm. On some occasions, liquidity problems arise on smaller exchanges affecting trade execution. I've seen people's entire investments wiped out in moments, underscoring instability. Risk management becomes critical, with stop-loss orders serving as protection. Knowing when to exit is essential to preserve capital and maintain a level head. Strategies to Manage Crypto Market Volatility I've navigated the turbulence of the crypto market by applying specific strategies to manage unpredictability. These tactics help me handle risks and seize opportunities. Diversification Techniques for Risk Reduction I diversify my cryptocurrency investments to minimise risk. Spreading funds across multiple cryptocurrencies limits exposure to any single fall. For instance, I invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and smaller altcoins. This creates a buffer against significant losses. Studies of 87 cryptocurrencies show this approach reduces volatility. Utilising Stop-Loss Orders Using stop-loss orders, I protect my investments from drastic price drops. I set limits to automatically sell assets when prices fall to a certain level. This prevents emotional decisions during panic. It’s like having a safety net that secures part of my capital against an unpredictable crash. Staying Informed through News and Analysis I stay informed about market developments by following credible news sources like CoinDesk and Cointelegraph. Analysing reports and expert opinions helps me anticipate market trends. This practice empowers me to make informed decisions and adapt my strategies effectively. Knowledge is key to managing volatility efficiently. Tools for Monitoring Crypto Market Volatility Staying on top of market volatility is crucial in cryptocurrency trading. I rely on specific tools to better understand and navigate these fluctuations. Crypto Volatility Index (CVI) The Crypto Volatility Index, or CVI, offers insights into expected market volatility. Similar to the VIX in traditional markets, it provides a measure of market expectations. I often use the CVI to gauge potential price movements. It proves invaluable for timing trades and identifying entry and exit points in this fast-paced environment. The CVI draws on data from major exchanges, compiling it into a metric that helps me strategise my trades. This tool's ability to synthesise complex market data into actionable insights has helped me minimise risks and optimise returns. Analytical Platforms and Mobile Apps Using analytical platforms offers a plethora of data-driven insights. Platforms like TradingView or Coinigy provide charting tools that I find essential for technical analysis. They help me spot trends and resistance levels easily. Mobile apps, like Blockfolio, allow me to monitor portfolios on the go, keeping me informed. They send alerts about price changes, which is a lifesaver when I'm not at my desk. With seamless interfaces, these tools enhance my ability to react promptly to market shifts. Being connected in real-time means I can seize opportunities the moment they arise, which boosts my trading outcomes. Conclusion Embracing the volatile nature of the crypto market requires a blend of knowledge, adaptability, and strategic thinking. By understanding the unique factors that drive price fluctuations, we can better navigate this dynamic landscape. Staying informed and using the right tools are crucial for making informed decisions and managing risks effectively. While the thrill of potential gains is enticing, it's essential to remain cautious and employ risk management strategies to protect investments. With the right approach, the unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies offers not just challenges but also significant opportunities for growth and innovation.

That’s where cryptocurrency trading signals come into play, acting as a compass to guide traders through the turbulent waters of digital assets. I’ve found these signals to be invaluable in making informed decisions, especially when the market’s volatility can be overwhelming. Trading signals provide insights and recommendations on when to buy or sell specific cryptocurrencies, often based on technical analysis or market trends. They offer a sense of direction and confidence, allowing traders to capitalise on opportunities they might otherwise miss. My experience with trading signals has not only enhanced my trading strategy but also broadened my understanding of market dynamics. In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, having access to reliable trading signals can make all the difference. They empower traders to stay ahead of the curve and maximise their potential returns, turning uncertainty into opportunity. Key Takeaways Cryptocurrency trading signals provide vital guidance for traders, offering insights on when to buy or sell digital assets, thus aiding in navigating the volatile crypto market. There are two main types of trading signals: manual, crafted by expert analysts, and automated, generated through algorithms; each offers distinct advantages like strategic human insight and rapid data processing. Using trading signals can increase efficiency by automating trades, reduce emotional decision-making, and provide clear entry and exit points, enhancing overall trading strategy. Selecting reliable signal providers is crucial for trading success; factors to consider include a provider’s track record, signal accuracy, and transparency in performance metrics. While trading signals are beneficial, it is important to be aware of potential risks like reliance on inaccurate signals and the impact of market volatility on signal effectiveness. Balancing signals with personal analysis is essential for successful trading. Understanding Cryptocurrency Trading Signals I’ve found that learning about cryptocurrency trading signals can truly enhance my trading skills. These notifications are invaluable, offering insights that help me make informed decisions in a volatile crypto market. Let’s delve into what trading signals are all about. Definition of Trading Signals Trading signals are vital notifications indicating when to buy or sell cryptocurrencies. Analysts analyse market data to craft these signals, efficiently assessing patterns and trends. Sometimes, automated systems generate these signals, using intricate algorithms that monitor market activities. In my experience, combining expert analysis with automated insights provides a balanced perspective. Importance of Trading Signals in Cryptocurrency Trading signals are crucial for anyone involved in trading. They give clear actions based on market analysis, something that I’ve always found beneficial. When the market’s volatile, signals are guiding stars, often pointing me to profitable trades. They reduce the noise in overwhelming market data. With signals, I anticipate market moves and tailor my strategies accordingly. Types of Cryptocurrency Trading Signals Navigating the cryptocurrency market can be daunting. Trading signals have transformed my strategy, providing clear buy and sell recommendations during volatile times. Let’s delve into two primary signal types: manual and automated. Manual Trading Signals Manual trading signals arise from expert traders. These professionals delve into market analysis, examining trends and historical data. They employ fundamental and technical tools to forecast movements. The details in these signals specify asset names, buy/sell indications, price points, and risk levels. The human touch behind these signals instils confidence and has often guided my trading decisions effectively. Automated Trading Signals Automated trading signals are generated by complex algorithms. These systems analyse vast datasets more rapidly than humans, offering timely alerts. Unlike manual signals, they continuously assess market conditions, adapting to changes instantly. Automated signals include detailed parameters such as entry and exit points. Their precision and speed have streamlined my trading process, allowing me to act swiftly on opportunities without second-guessing. How to Use Cryptocurrency Trading Signals Interpreting Signal Data Understanding how to read signal data is crucial. Signal data usually includes entry and exit points. For example, I often see price targets and stop-loss levels. Analysing this data helps me decide if a signal aligns with my strategy. I look for patterns and align them with broader market trends. Recognising these elements improves my ability to act confidently on trading signals. Some signals prioritize short-term gains, while others aim for long-term strategies. Implementing Signals in Trading Strategy Incorporating signals into my trading plan has been a game-changer. I connect my exchange account to a signals platform. This lets me automate trades based on selected signals. Platforms like 3Commas offer tools to create bots. These bots execute trades when conditions match my signals. I adjust settings to manage risk and return. For me, using signals takes emotion out of trading and enhances precision. This systematic approach can increase success rates significantly. I find it’s essential to regularly review signal performance and make necessary tweaks. Benefits of Using Cryptocurrency Trading Signals Cryptocurrency trading signals provide clear recommendations for buying and selling. Below are ways these signals can enhance your trading strategy. Increasing Trading Efficiency Signals automate trading actions. They integrate with bots to place numerous trades, saving me time. Manual trading would be exhausting, but automation enhances my efficiency. I appreciate timely insights they offer. Signals analyse market trends, providing precise entry and exit points. Structured data in signals simplifies my trading process, avoiding information overload. Reducing Emotional Decision-Making Signals minimise emotional trading decisions. Automated systems execute trades based on logic, not emotions. I rely on structured signals to keep my trading strategy aligned. They provide specific stop loss and take profit levels, which helps control impulsive decisions. Following signals keeps me disciplined, reducing stress. This data-driven approach enhances my trading consistency, fostering a calm mindset. Choosing Reliable Cryptocurrency Trading Signals Choosing the right cryptocurrency trading signals can significantly boost your trading success. I’ve found that picking the right signal provider is crucial. Evaluating Signal Providers Seeking expertise is important when evaluating providers. I prefer services with a solid track record. For instance, Crypto Inner Circle boasts a 92% win rate, while Binance Killers hits nearly 95%. Trustworthy providers like CryptoSignals.org use skilled traders and AI algorithms. I always review their past trades before making any decisions. Transparency matters to me. Binance Killers and CryptoSignals.org offer detailed trade results and analytic insights. Considering Signal Accuracy and Performance Accuracy is key in trading signals. Providers like Crypto Inner Circle deliver consistent, high-quality signals. Their performance metrics are transparent. I find that past performance data helps me assess potential profitability. Measuring signal performance is crucial. I feel more confident using services like Token Metrics, which leverage AI to ensure precision. Observing win rates helps me evaluate consistency over time. I choose providers based on their demonstrated accuracy, trusting in their proven performance. Risks Associated with Cryptocurrency Trading Signals Navigating cryptocurrency trading signals can be daunting. I’ve found it rewarding, yet it’s essential to be aware of potential risks. Dependence on Incorrect Signals Depending heavily on trading signals can be risky. Signals rely on algorithms which may not always be accurate. Flawed data can lead to wrong predictions. Incorrect signals can cause significant losses. I once experienced this when an ill-timed signal led to a substantial loss. It’s crucial to cross-check signals and not solely rely on them. Balancing signals with your own analysis strengthens decision-making. A good mix boosts trading confidence. Market Volatility Impacts Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Market fluctuations affect signal reliability. High volatility can render signals ineffective. I learned this when sudden market drops impacted my trades despite positive signals. Adjusting to market changes is vital. Embracing volatility as a trader sharpens one’s strategy. Keeping an adaptable mindset allows for better trading outcomes. Conclusion Cryptocurrency trading signals have undeniably transformed my trading approach by offering valuable insights and enhancing my strategic decisions. By leveraging both manual and automated signals I’ve managed to navigate the volatile market with greater confidence and precision. Choosing reliable signal providers and integrating these signals into my trading strategy has been pivotal in maximising returns and minimising emotional biases. However it’s crucial to remain vigilant and adaptable in the face of market volatility ensuring that signals are complemented by personal analysis. With the right balance of expert insights and automated systems I’ve found that trading signals serve as indispensable tools in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency trading.

Definition of Digital Asset Portfolio Digital asset portfolio management uses cutting-edge technology. It incorporates cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and digital financial instruments. Platforms like Talos streamline portfolio management, integrating risk and treasury tools. This approach ensures I tailor investments to fit my risk profile and goals, enhancing my overall strategy and decision-making. Importance of Digital Asset Management Digital asset management is crucial in today's tech-driven world. It enables me to strategically diversify, reducing risk and maximising potential returns. Maintaining a well-managed portfolio allows me to make informed decisions and seize emerging opportunities, empowering my financial future. Using such comprehensive platforms provides a competitive edge. Building a Diverse Digital Asset Portfolio Creating a diverse digital asset portfolio can be both exciting and rewarding. With careful planning, I discovered the balance between potential returns and minimising risk, which was truly empowering. Identifying Types of Digital Assets In the digital realm, options abound. I explored cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering decentralisation and broad market appeal. NFTs opened doors to unique digital art investments. DeFi coins introduced fresh finance models. Each provided diverse growth avenues. Evaluating Risk and Reward Understanding risk was crucial. I assessed potential volatility in cryptocurrencies compared to traditional stocks. Reward analysis helped gauge long-term benefits against short-term risks. This evaluation crafted a strategy aligning with my financial goals, ensuring balance. Through this approach, my digital asset portfolio struck a harmonious balance, promising both safety and potential growth. This process provided immense satisfaction as I navigated the evolving landscape of digital investments with confidence. Implementing Asset Allocation Strategies Implementing asset allocation strategies in digital assets has transformed my portfolio management approach. I've witnessed how strategic asset diversification and risk balancing can optimise returns while keeping risks at bay. Diversification Techniques Embracing diversification is essential. I diversify by spreading investments across cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and DeFi coins. This mix helps manage risk by ensuring no single asset dominates. Platforms like Talos aid in achieving this by offering precise tools and insights. With Talos's advanced features, I've designed a balanced digital asset portfolio that spans multiple sectors. By doing this, I minimise potential losses and enhance growth opportunities. Through careful diversification, I've gained a resilient portfolio that thrives despite market fluctuations. Balancing High-Risk and Low-Risk Assets Balancing high-risk and low-risk assets provides stability. I examine asset volatility and allocate proportionally based on my risk tolerance. High-risk assets like altcoins offer potential high returns but can be volatile. In contrast, stablecoins act as the low-risk component, offering steadiness. I adjust allocations, balancing growth with preservation. The ultimate goal is to create a portfolio that leverages opportunities without overexposure. By maintaining this balance, I've experienced secure growth and shielded my investments from extreme volatility. Choosing the Right Digital Asset Management Tools Deciding on the right digital asset management tools has transformed how I handle my diversified portfolio. The variety of tools available offers unique benefits and makes the process both efficient and enjoyable. Overview of Popular Tools and Platforms Kubera stands out as an all-in-one wealth tracker that simplifies monitoring traditional and digital assets. I appreciate its capability to integrate crypto, stocks, and NFTs in one platform, which keeps everything organised. Talos offers a robust Portfolio Management System combining portfolio construction and risk management. I find its real-time risk monitoring ideal for staying informed and making calculated decisions. The continuous reconciliation with exchanges reduces hassles and makes managing the portfolio smoother. Selecting the right tool is crucial to streamline asset management. Criteria for Selecting Management Tools I consider integration capabilities essential when selecting tools. They must support different asset types like crypto and stocks. User-friendly interfaces significantly help manage assets without technical hiccups. Real-time updates are vital; they ensure my portfolio reflects true market values and assist in timely adjustments. Cost-effectiveness is crucial; I seek tools balancing price and features without expensive licences. Security features like encryption are indispensable and make me confident knowing my assets are safe. These criteria guide my choice, guaranteeing efficient asset management. Monitoring and Adjusting Your Portfolio Tracking Performance Metrics I track my digital assets in real time using platforms like Talos. They offer valuable insights into trends and performance metrics. These updates guide me in deciding when to reallocate assets. Monitoring these metrics keeps my portfolio aligned with my financial goals. Adapting to Market Changes I adapt swiftly to market shifts by rebalancing my portfolio. Every six months, I review asset allocations, adjusting them based on value shifts of 5% or more. This means I can respond to changes without delay. Using digital tools equips me to seize opportunities, protecting my investments. Mitigating Risks in Digital Asset Management Managing my digital asset portfolio involves understanding the significance of risks and implementing strategies to protect my investments. Exploring these methods has equipped me with a sense of security and financial confidence. Understanding Security Measures I use robust security measures to protect my digital investments. Secure wallets store my cryptocurrencies, and I choose platforms with encryption protocols. I enable two-factor authentication across accounts and always update security applications. Security can't be compromised, and I've embraced the importance of keeping my assets safe. Cyber theft is a real threat, but with constant vigilance, I can stay prepared. Regular security audits ensure my portfolio remains protected. Protecting Against Volatility Market volatility is constant, so I employ strategies to protect my investments. I diversify across assets to reduce risks and avoid overexposure in one area. Monitoring market trends, I've learned to adjust allocations to minimise impact. Developing a disciplined approach helps me manage emotions in volatile market conditions. I set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses during market dips. My risk management strategy ensures I stay focused on long-term growth, despite short-term fluctuations. This approach keeps me grounded and confident in my portfolio strategy. Conclusion Embarking on the journey of digital asset portfolio management has been both enlightening and empowering. By strategically diversifying my investments and leveraging advanced tools, I've achieved a balanced portfolio that aligns with my financial aspirations. The integration of platforms like Talos and Kubera has streamlined the process, enabling me to monitor and adjust my assets with precision. Emphasising risk management and security measures has fortified my approach, allowing me to navigate market fluctuations confidently. This proactive and informed strategy has not only enhanced my financial security but also opened up exciting avenues for future growth in the evolving digital landscape.

36837373,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102695,1732538585,BitBoy Says One Day You’ll Wish You Bought More XRP Than XLM,"Famous market pundit Ben Armstrong (BitBoy) has voiced the bold view that market participants favoring XLM over XRP could regret their choice later on. Notably, XRP and its major rival Stellar (XLM) have been among the market leaders in price performance over the last three weeks. However, market commentators like BitBoy are favoring XRP over XLM despite XLM boasting a better price performance in recent times.XLM Beats XRP in Price ActionWith XRP trading at $1.50 today, the altcoin is up by 204% from its November low of $0.4937. However, its latest upsurge to the $1.6216 peak this month marked a 229% growth within three weeks.Meanwhile, XLM had its lowest value for this month at $0.08952. As it currently trades at $0.5242, XLM boasts a more impressive three-week growth of 485%. The performance becomes even more spectacular, with a 609% gain when considering XLM’s high of $0.6342 this month.Essentially, XLM has experienced about three times XRP's gains. This explosive growth has propelled XLM up the rankings, moving from position 30, with a market cap of $2.65 billion, to its current position at number 13, with a valuation of $16.5 billion.Despite XLM’s superior price action compared to XRP, XRP proponents remain unfazed. According to BitBoy, the issue with choosing XLM for a portfolio is that one day, investors may wish they had bought more XRP.He went on to declare that XRP and the Ondo token from Ondo Finance will be the two best-performing assets of the season. However, BitBoy’s perspective did not resonate with all crypto community members.Community Members Disagree with BitBoyOne commenter, Martyn Rogue, remarked that BitBoy's suggestion is ""bad advice,"" a sentiment shared by many others. Rogue pointed out that he’s personally up 141% in profit from just XLM over the past week, and his only regret is not doubling down as he did with XRP during its rise.Another commenter, Clark, suggested owning both XRP and XLM would be wiser rather than favoring one over the other. Clark noted that anyone who owns XRP should also hold XLM, Hedera (HBAR), and a few other assets.Community member Ajax also highlighted that XLM has its own strengths and weaknesses. While Stellar boasts great technology and partnerships, Ajax believes that diversifying with both XLM and XRP could maximize his portfolio’s potential, which is why he holds both.Meanwhile, prominent crypto analyst Egrag shared a strategy for navigating XRP and XLM. He recommended purchasing 25% of XLM as a reference to XRP. If there’s a retracement, sell XLM and use the profits to buy more XRP, avoiding the risk of selling XRP too early.",NEGATIVE,XLM | XRP,MARKET | TRADING | XLM | XRP | ONDO,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/25/bitboy-says-one-day-youll-wish-you-bought-more-xrp-than-xlm/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitboy-says-one-day-youll-wish-you-bought-more-xrp-than-xlm,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Bitcoin is swiftly nearing the $100K mark, and with its star power in full display, other coins are surging left and right. Leading the way is Cardano (ADA), a research-driven blockchain with immense long-term potential. Binance Coin (BNB) follows closely, serving as the utility token behind one of the largest crypto ecosystems. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making waves as a leading Layer 1 blockchain transforming mining accessibility. Its native coin has already surged 2240% since presale batch 1. Alongside these, other innovative projects are reshaping decentralized finance and meme coin culture, promising to define this exciting market phase. 1.

Binance Coin (BNB): Driving the Binance Ecosystem Binance Coin (BNB) is the utility token powering the Binance ecosystem, offering reduced trading fees on one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges. Initially launched on Ethereum, BNB now operates on its own blockchain with a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model. Beyond fee discounts, BNB fuels Binance’s decentralized exchange and supports various blockchain projects. As a top cryptocurrency by market capitalization, BNB is a reliable option for traders and developers seeking a robust and versatile token. The Next Bull Run Was Here Yesterday!

A resignation by Gary Gensler will undoubtedly shift in the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, particularly the XRP price. These regulatory shifts in the crypto industry by the US SEC will also be advantageous for emerging projects like WallitIQ (WLTQ) , which is currently in its presale phase. Implications Of Gary Gensler Step Down For XRP Price And The Crypto Industry The tenure of current SEC chairman Gary Gensler has been marked by a stringent approach toward cryptocurrency regulation, often described as aggressive by industry stakeholders. His enforcement actions have targeted several crypto companies and exchanges, including Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP. This has led to an external pressure on the XRP price growth over the past few years. The prospect of Gary Gensler departure has been met with optimism within the crypto community. Even rumors of a looming departure of the SEC Chairman, Gary Gensler have been enough to push the XRP price above $1 for the first time in over three years. The XRP price has experienced a notable surge, with its price surpassing $1.26 on Binance, driven by heightened activity among investors. The anticipated regulatory shift could further bolster XRP's market position, and the XRP price is set to keep surging in the coming years, especially when a new SEC Chairman comes in. Aside from a positive XRP price outlook, the appointment of a crypto-favorable SEC chairman could create a more supportive atmosphere for the cryptocurrency market, benefiting new entrants like WallitIQ (WLTQ). What Is WallitIQ And How Can It Benefit From SEC Chairman Gary Gensler Step Down? The exit of Gary Gensler and the appointment of a crypto-positive SEC chairman are going to open the industry to more investors. This, in turn, is expected to increase the need for a more secure and private means of crypto custody, and this is where DeFi platform WallitIQ (WLTQ) makes its entry. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that is bringing artificial intelligence technology and machine learning algorithms into cryptocurrency wallets The platform aims to provide users with advanced security measures, personalized portfolio management, and easy trading interactions within the crypto ecosystem. A key feature of WallitIQ (WLTQ) is its AI-driven security system, which actively monitors wallet transactions to detect and mitigate suspicious activities, thereby safeguarding users' crypto assets. The platform's adaptive learning capabilities allow it to continuously improve itself, allowing it to stay ahead of new threats while also offering real-time security tailored to individual usage patterns. In addition to security, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers AI-powered portfolio management tools that provide users with insights into their investment strategies, helping them make informed decisions aligned with their investment targets. The platform also emphasizes user education by offering resources such as tutorials, market analyses, and a multilingual 24/7 support. Interestingly, all these features have been certified alongside a SolidProof smart contract audit of its utility cryptocurrency called WallitIQ, with the ticker symbol WLTQ. As a utility token, WLTQ grants holders access to premium AI wallet functionalities, participation in governance decisions, and the opportunity to earn staking rewards of up to 180% APY, among many others. Furthermore, users can pay gas fees using WallitIQ (WLTQ) when sending cryptocurrencies. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is currently in a presale stage, which offers early investors the opportunity to participate in the platform's growth. The presale has garnered significant attention, with early numbers showing over $1.2 million raised in a short period. The WLTQ token is priced at $0.0171 during this initial stage. Conclusion The resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler is going to usher in a more favorable crypto environment, especially for the XRP price. This shift will also influence emerging projects such as WallitIQ (WLTQ) stand to benefit from this potential regulatory easing. Savvy investors are already staying ahead of the curve and are now positioning themselves in the ongoing WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale.

In the daily chart, the NEAR token price shows a V-shaped recovery rally gaining momentum. With the broader market recovery, the NEAR token price has surged from the $3.50 mark to the current market price of $6.833. This accounts for a massive 95% price surge in the last three weeks. Will this recovery rally result in a price surge beyond the $10 psychological mark? Let’s find out.Near Token Price AnalysisBefore the V-shaped reversal, NEAR Protocol’s price trend showed a breakout from a falling channel rally. However, it struggled to break above the 50% Fibonacci level at $5.89, which led to a drop to the $3.50 mark. NEAR Price Chart The ongoing recovery rally has seen only 6 out of 21 bearish candles over the past 21 days. Currently, another potential bearish candle is forming with an intraday pullback of 0.52%.Despite the intraday pullback, NEAR's price trend showcases four consecutive bullish candles, accounting for a price surge of nearly 30%. The intraday pullback showcases a higher price rejection from the 78.60% Fibonacci level at $7.263. The underlying surge in buying pressure has resulted in a golden crossover and a bullish crossover between the 100-day and 200-day EMA lines. The RSI line has entered the overbought zone as the altcoin struggles to sustain dominance above the $7.00 mark, increasing the possibility of a minor pullback. Near Protocol Price Targets $11 Amid Increased VolatilityAmid the retest chances, the 61.80% Fibonacci level remains the immediate support level. This support level is priced at $6.458. Given the overall uptrend, a breakout above the 78.60% Fibonacci level would likely target the $8.29 mark.Further upside price targets are at the 1.272 and 1.618 Fibonacci levels, which are priced at $9.59 and $11.25, respectively.",POSITIVE,NEAR,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | NEAR,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/25/from-3-50-to-6-83-near-protocols-95-surge-targets-11/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=from-3-50-to-6-83-near-protocols-95-surge-targets-11,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36825155,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654798,1732537809,ETH/BTC’s 8-Year Cycle Chart Shows How High Ethereum Price Can Go This Cycle,"Recent analysis suggests that the Ethereum price may be operating on an 8-year cycle, diverging from Bitcoin’s established 4-year cycle. This would explain the sheer underperformance of the Ethereum price in relation to the Bitcoin price since the beginning of the year. Keeping this in mind, technical analysis suggests that the Ethereum price still has a long way to go in this cycle, especially if the Bitcoin price starts to undergo a major correction. Understanding ETH/BTC’s 8-Year Cycle Technical analysis of the ETH/BTC chart has pointed out an interesting cycle between both crypto heavyweights. Notably, the chart shows that the Ethereum price has been largely underperforming against the Bitcoin price for the past few years, a trend that has been further exacerbated since July of this year. Related Reading: XRP Price Reaches 3-Year High At $1.6 – 2 Ways It Can Go From Here Unlike the Bitcoin price, which follows a well-documented 4-year cycle aligned with its halving events, the Ethereum price seems to chart a different path. Over the years, data suggests that Ethereum is aligned with an 8-year cycle. This distinction explains why Ethereum and its ecosystem often appear to lag behind Bitcoin during bull runs and bear markets. Interestingly, this distinction has been very obvious in the current bull cycle, which has seen the Bitcoin price breaking into multiple new all-time highs while Ethereum continues to struggle under $4,000. Ethereum’s 8-year cycle indicates that as the Bitcoin price starts to reach a peak within its own cycle, Ethereum could be counterbalancing these movements. This plays into the notion of an altcoin season where investors start to take profit on the Bitcoin price and start investing in the altcoin market. According to an analysis on the TradingView platform, the 4-year cycle of the Bitcoin price suggests that the leading cryptocurrency might plunge to the depth of its sinusodial path by 2026, according to its Power Law corridor by 2026. On the other hand, this predicted Bitcoin price decline will be counteracted by a simultaneous Ethereum price surge that would push it to its highest point in the 8-year cycle by 2026. Projected Peak For Ethereum Price In Mid-2026 Based on the 8-year cycle theory, Ethereum’s price is anticipated to peak by mid-2026. This peak is expected to align with the trough of Bitcoin’s 4-year cycle, creating a counterbalance between the two leading cryptocurrencies. During this period, Ethereum’s price is projected to climb to its highest levels as Bitcoin enters a price correction phase. Additionally, BNB is expected to act as a stabilizing asset alongside Ethereum as the Bitcoin price declines. Related Reading: Dogecoin ATH Incoming?

Attention is even more on projects that combine real-world utility with scalability, with the belief that they will also “become Ethereum” one day. One such project is PropiChain (PCHAIN) , which aims to solve the challenges of the famous real estate market. Meanwhile, Cardano Price movements have not been so impressive for the past few days, and this has raised concerns if PropiChain will be the next altcoin to take the spotlight beside Ethereum with predictions of a massive 15,430% rally. Ethereum and Cardano: A Quick Comparison Ethereum’s recent rally to $3,500 is fueled by the growing adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi), maintaining its position as the go-to blockchain for innovation. While the project is performing well, investors are still looking to diversify from the usual to maximize their returns. While designed for scalability, Cardano has yet to deliver significant breakthroughs recently. Its current price movements suggest it struggles to maintain investors’ interest, even though leading altcoins like Ethereum are gaining. PCHAIN , with its targeted approach to solving real-world issues, offers a value proposition that Cardano lacks. It combines real estate tokenization, AI analytics, and metaverse capabilities to deliver a versatile and profitable investment platform. What Sets PropiChain Apart? PropiChain (PCHAIN) is a groundbreaking RWA altcoin that bridges the gap between blockchain technology and real-world assets. Specifically, PropiChain focuses on: Fractional Property Ownership This project enables investors to own fractional shares of properties, providing access to high-value real estate assets for a fraction of their traditional cost. For example, with as little as $500, you can invest in properties that traditionally require millions of dollars to enter. AI-Driven Insights The platform integrates AI tools to analyze market trends, predict property values, and identify high-return opportunities. So, you can benefit from real-time insights that maximize your profit, whether you are flipping properties or holding them for long-term appreciation. Metaverse Integration PropiChain extends its utility into the metaverse, offering tools for global buyers and sellers to connect. In addition to showcasing virtual property tours, it provides real estate agents and developers with a platform to market their assets internationally without restrictions, increasing deal opportunities. Smart Contracts PropiChain uses smart contracts to automate processes such as rental agreements, escrow services, and property transfers. This reduces costs and ensures that transactions are tamper-proof and transparent. Why PropiChain Could Outperform Cardano Unlike Cardano, which focuses heavily on theoretical scalability, PropiChain has already implemented practical solutions. Its tokenization model lets investors directly participate in the real estate market, making it a tangible asset-backed cryptocurrency. Also, PropiChain’s ecosystem is designed to maximize investor returns. Whether through its AI valuation tools or blockchain’s transparency, it ensures that users can make informed decisions and secure higher profits. Then, its growth trajectory. While Cardano Price movements are tied to broader market trends, PropiChain’s growth is fueled by its utility-driven demand. Analysts predict a 15,430% rally, positioning it as one of the most profitable investments of the coming year. The PropiChain Presale PropiChain is currently in presale stage 1, offering tokens at just $0.004, the lowest price they’ll ever be. As demand surges, the price will rise by 275% to $0.011 in stage 2, creating a sense of urgency for early investors. Analysts predict a potential price of $1 by 2025, so early adopters could see even more gains. The project’s credibility is bolstered by its security review by BlockAudit and CoinMarketCap listing . These features add a layer of trust for cautious investors looking for sustainable growth. The similarities between PropiChain’s presale rally and Ethereum’s early rise are obvious. Ethereum started as a solution-focused blockchain and quickly gained traction, much like PropiChain is doing now. Missing out on this presale could mean watching others rake in massive profits. By stage 2, the price will already increase by 275%. By the time the token hits exchanges, early investors stand to gain exponentially up to 800%. A $1000 investment would yield $8000 by stage 4. Imagine what would happen when it finally hits the exchange. Conclusion Ethereum’s climb to $3,500 shows the crypto market’s potential for massive gains, but PropiChain is emerging as the altcoin to watch. With its focus on real-world solutions, investor-centric rich features, and unparalleled growth potential, it’s likely to surpass Cardano Price trends and deliver unprecedented returns. The presale price of $0.004 won’t last long, and the shift to stage 2 will push prices higher. Don’t miss out! This could be your chance to secure life-changing profits. Join PropiChain presale now.

Kaspa Cryptocurrency: Fast PoW Coin with GHOSTDAG and BlockDAG Technology Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that uses the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, GHOSTDAG allows blocks created in parallel to coexist and orders them in consensus, forming a blockDAG instead of a chain. This enables Kaspa to achieve high block rates, currently at one block per second and aiming for more, with confirmation times limited mainly by internet latency. Kaspa includes features like Reachability for querying the DAG's structure, block data pruning, SPV proofs, and plans for subnetwork support to simplify future layer 2 solutions. With its innovative technology and focus on scalability and speed, Kaspa shows potential in the market, making it an attractive option in the current cycle. Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL): A Multifunctional Asset with Growth Potential Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL) is a utility token in the Polygon network. It plays key roles in staking, where holders lock tokens to participate in network consensus and earn rewards. POL enables governance, granting holders voting power on proposals affecting the network's development. It provides access to exclusive services within the ecosystem. As Polygon continues to grow and integrate more services, demand for POL may rise. In the current market cycle, with the expanding use cases and network growth, POL appears to be an attractive asset in the cryptocurrency space. Dogwifhat (WIF): A New Dog-Themed Meme Coin on Solana Dogwifhat (WIF) is a new meme coin on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. Meme coins are cryptocurrencies that emerge from internet memes or pop culture, with dog-themed tokens being especially popular. WIF focuses on building a community and providing fun interactions for its users. It leverages Solana's fast transaction speeds and low fees. In the current market cycle, WIF's growing popularity and active community may draw interest. The coin's technology and engagement could contribute to its potential in the crypto market. Conclusion While KAS, POL, and WIF have less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom. Its presale offers a 700% ROI, starting at $0.0002 and rising to $0.0016 over 14 stages. With governance rights, rewards, and staking, Catzilla unites crypto enthusiasts, meme fans, and anime lovers.

Bessent, a renowned hedge fund manager and blockchain advocate, is known for his time as chief investment officer for billionaire George Soros and his founding of Key Square Capital Management. His nomination represents a clear move away from the cautious approach of Janet Yellen, the current Treasury Secretary under Joe Biden. If confirmed, Bessent could introduce clearer regulations and policies that encourage the adoption of digital assets, potentially paving the way for their integration into mainstream finance. His pro-crypto stance aligns with Trump’s increasing support for digital innovation . Bessent has long championed the transformative potential of blockchain technology. Earlier this year, he emphasized in an interview that ""crypto is about freedom"" and attracts younger generations who were previously disconnected from financial markets. His confidence in the sector extends to significant investments in blockchain startups and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. These actions sharply contrast with Yellen’s concerns over crypto’s potential misuse in illicit activities and its risks to financial stability. Trump’s own embrace of cryptocurrency underscores this shift. During his campaign, he accepted crypto contributions, becoming the first presidential candidate to do so. At one point, he even suggested the idea of a federal Bitcoin reserve, stating that ""our government should never sell Bitcoin."" High-profile figures in the crypto world, like the Winklevoss twins and Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell, contributed substantial sums to Trump’s campaign using digital currencies. Bessent’s appointment could address one of the industry’s biggest hurdles: the lack of consistent regulation. Over recent years, unclear policies and unpredictable enforcement actions have created uncertainty, limiting crypto’s broader adoption. Industry leaders see Bessent’s leadership as an opportunity to establish a more coherent framework. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently described him as ""the most pro-innovation, pro-crypto Treasury Secretary we’ve ever seen."" However, challenges remain. Critics warn that while Bessent’s background might favor institutional investors, smaller players and retail traders could be overlooked. Furthermore, major regulatory changes would still require approval from Congress, where bipartisan concerns about crypto’s environmental impact, fraud risks, and market manipulation persist. Balancing innovation and regulation will be a delicate task for Bessent if he takes on the Treasury role. While he supports integrating blockchain to improve financial systems, he has also stressed the importance of “smart regulation” to maintain oversight without stifling growth. His pragmatic approach could provide the clarity and stability the crypto industry has long sought, but political and regulatory obstacles are likely to test his vision.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-s-pick-for-treasury-sparks-crypto-revolution,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36824821.jpeg

FET Gearing Up for Breakout Amid Altcoin Season Optimism Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) is showing signs of potential growth. After a recent dip of 7.82% over the past month, FET's price is stabilizing between $1.08 and $1.54. The RSI stands at 50.52, indicating neutral momentum, while the stochastic at 35.36 suggests the coin is oversold. With the nearest resistance at $1.82, breaking this level could push FET towards the next target of $2.28, offering a potential gain of over 40%. As the crypto market gears up for a possible bull run, FET might be poised to ride the wave. Traders are watching for a move above the simple moving averages to confirm an upward trend. Stacks (STX) Gains 8%, Eyes Resistance at $2.53 Amid Bullish Momentum Stacks (STX) has risen over 8% in the past week, trading between around $1.60 and $2.20. The 10-day moving average is above the 100-day average, showing positive momentum. The RSI at 55.56 indicates room for growth before overbought levels. If STX breaks the resistance at $2.53, it could climb further. Hitting the next resistance at just over $3 would be a gain of more than 40% from current prices. This uptrend suggests potential for more growth, as the crypto market anticipates an altcoin season. Injective (INJ) Poised for Significant Gains as Altcoin Season Nears Injective (INJ) is showing strong signs of growth. Over the past month, its price has increased by 20.06%. The current price ranges between $22.21 and $27.05. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are both around $24.50, indicating stability. The Relative Strength Index is at 57.67, suggesting the asset is not overbought. If INJ breaks the nearest resistance level at $29, it could rise to the next resistance at $34, representing a potential increase of about 17%. With the approaching altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, INJ might leverage this momentum for significant gains. Conclusion FET, STX, and INJ may offer less short-term potential. Catzilla, the ultimate meme coin hero, aims to bring financial freedom to everyone.

With older altcoins $XRP and $ADA also putting on great gains over recent days, could $ETH be about to breakout, and also start reversing its long downward trend against $BTC? Is the latest surge for ETH/BTC just a retest of resistance? Source: TradingView The $ETH price has followed a downward trend against its $BTC pair (ETH/BTC) since all the way back in 2017. That is a long, long time for the number 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization. That said, for the 2021 bull market, $ETH did make some big inroads into wiping out its losses against $BTC. However, since 2022, there has been another long period of downwards movement for $ETH, which culminated in a nasty drop out of the bottom of a 2-year descending channel. This fall in the ETH/BTC price also took it below a major support level at 0.0335 BTC. With the Stochastic RSI indicators on the weekly having crossed back down, the latest $ETH fight-back might just be a retest of the major support - turning it into strong resistance. $ETH price heads to potential wedge pattern breakout Source: TradingView Nevertheless, on the weekly time frame for the ETH/USD pair, things are looking decidedly rosier. The $ETH price is within a wedge pattern, and given that this is a continuation of an upward trend, the price might be expected to break out of the top of this pattern. One thing that is perhaps not in $ETH’s favour is that the Stochastic RSI indicators are starting to roll over. This does not necessarily mean that upside price momentum is definitely going to desert $ETH, because the indicators could still climb higher, but it is certainly something for $ETH bulls to bear in mind. ETH/SOL is perhaps the biggest concern for $ETH bulls Source: TradingView Perhaps of even more concern for the $ETH bulls is the SOL/ETH price. After following a range for the most part of 2024, the price broke out in favour of $ETH’s foremost layer 1 competitor. An all-time high for $SOL against $ETH came with the breakout, and the price is still ascending. The Fibonacci extension levels are potential targets above. The 1.618 is at 0.09 ETH, and the 2.618 is at 0.141. As this bull market unfolds, and having already made huge gains against $ETH, the $SOL price is well-positioned to go even higher.

Though SHIB's ascent is making news, another newcomer, Rexas Finance (RXS), is discreetly gearing itself for much more gains—probably surpassing SHIB by a large margin. Shiba Inu’s Potential: Promising But Limited Renowned for its lively community and strong price swings, SHIB has been a favorite among cryptocurrencies. Its popularity is reflected in its market worth of more than $14 billion, and the expected 300% surge is quite remarkable. However, seasoned investors know that early on initiatives with great potential generally provide the largest returns; so, Rexas Finance helps in this regard. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Hidden Gem with 21,100% Growth Potential Rexas Finance is a breakthrough platform attempting to change the biggest sectors of the world by real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, not simply another altcoin. From its original price of $0.030, RXS has already seen a 200% rise; its seventh presale stage price is $0.090 as of writing. Investors have only a limited window to guarantee RXS at this low price before it leaps to $0.10—and finally to its launch price of $0.20 in early 2025—as the presale stage 7 is fast filling up (now 83.92% sold out as of writing). The growth potential is interesting: experts estimate RXS might hit an amazing $16.88, a jaw-dropping 21,101% gain. For those ready to act immediately, Rexas Finance presents a significantly more profitable prospect than SHIB's 300% possible increase. Why Investors Are Flocking to Rexas Finance Rexas Finance has developed a committed community of private investors, unlike many crypto initiatives depending on venture money. This grassroots strategy guarantees a large, devoted investment base fit for the long-term plan of the platform. In early 2025, Rexas Finance is expected to launch on three out of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges worldwide. This key turning point will greatly increase RXS's liquidity and visibility, thus influencing its price to possibly unprecedented levels. Security and openness are top priorities in the crypto space, hence Rexas Finance has obtained the Certik audit, adding still another degree of legitimacy and confidence for investors. With 20 lucky winners slated to get $50,000 worth of RXS each, the ongoing $1 million RXS giveaway has already drawn over 269,000 submissions as of writing. Participants can increase their winning chances by completing tasks on the Rexas Finance website and sharing the giveaway with their friends. Real-World Asset Tokenization: The Future of Finance The main product of Rexas Finance is a real-world asset tokenizing system meant to close the distance between conventional finance and blockchain technologies.

Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin (BTC) has seen significant gains lately. In the past week, its price increased by 12.89%. Over the last month, it surged by 46.32%. Even over six months, Bitcoin's price climbed by 42.23%. These numbers show a strong upward trend. Currently, Bitcoin is trading between $81,906 and $95,096. It's approaching the nearest resistance level at $100,724. If it breaks through, the next target is $113,913, which would be an increase of about 13%. On the downside, support levels are at $74,346 and $61,157. These levels might prevent significant price drops. Technical indicators suggest continued growth. The 10-day simple moving average is $98,524, higher than the 100-day average of $94,128. This indicates positive momentum. The Relative Strength Index stands at 61.24, showing there's still room for the price to rise before reaching overbought territory. With these factors, Bitcoin may continue its upward trajectory. Cardano (ADA) ADA has been on a remarkable upswing. In the past week, its price jumped by 53.02%. Over the last month, it surged by 142.74%, and in six months, it increased by 91.77%. The current price ranges between $0.54 and $0.84, showing strong market interest. Technical indicators support this positive trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 66.50, suggesting the asset is approaching overbought territory but still has room to grow. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.87, above the 100-day average of $0.78, indicating a short-term uptrend. The MACD level of 0.0210 points to bullish momentum, and the Stochastic at 73.55 reflects continued buying pressure. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is $0.98. Breaking above this could lead to the second resistance at $1.28, representing potential gains of over 20% and 50% respectively from current levels. On the downside, support is found at $0.38 and $0.0800. Based on recent performance and technical signals, Cardano may continue to rise, but traders should watch these key levels closely. XRP (XRP) XRP has seen impressive gains recently. Over the past week, its price jumped by 86.80%. In the last month, it surged 171.13%. In the past six months, the price increased by 167.37%. Currently, XRP trades between $0.66 and $1.36. These significant rises highlight growing interest in XRP. Based on this data, XRP's price might continue to rise. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 79.08, indicating strong momentum. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $1.40, higher than the 100-day average of $1.15. This upward trend suggests potential for further growth. The Stochastic indicator is at 91.22, supporting the bullish outlook. XRP's nearest resistance level is $1.66. If the price breaks this level, it could target the second resistance at $2.36, representing an increase of about 44%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.2672. If the price falls below current levels, it could test this support, which would be a decrease of around 80%. Monitoring these levels is crucial for anticipating XRP's next move. Conclusion While BTC, ADA, and XRP show promise in the 2024 bull run, XYZVerse (XYZ) offers greater potential with its unique sports meme ecosystem and ambitious growth targets.

XYZ is currently undervalued, and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Don’t miss your shot at being part of the XYZ winning team! Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is a trailblazer in the blockchain world. Created by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, it's known for smart contracts and a vast array of decentralized apps. With its shift to Proof-of-Stake in 2022, Ethereum became more efficient and eco-friendly. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon help make transactions faster and cheaper. Ether (ETH) is at the heart of it all, used for transactions, staking rewards, and as a tradable asset. Market trends suggest Ethereum has strong potential. Predictions estimate ETH could reach as high as $6,580 next year. With the upcoming sharding phase aiming to increase speed and lower costs, Ethereum is set to become even more appealing. Compared to other coins, its robust technology and active development make it stand out. In the current market cycle, with growing interest in decentralized finance, ETH looks like an attractive option. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013, featuring a Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be a fun alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum limit. What began as a ""memecoin"" quickly gained a loyal community. In 2021, its value soared, fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin entered the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, showing the power of community and the impact of social media on finance. Today, Dogecoin continues to capture attention. Its technology offers fast transactions and low fees, making it accessible for everyday use. While some see its unlimited supply as a challenge, others believe its strong community could drive future growth. Compared to other coins, Dogecoin stands out for its playful origin and widespread recognition. In a market that's always evolving, Dogecoin's blend of community support and media presence keeps it in the conversation. Whether it remains attractive depends on market trends and how it adapts, but it has certainly proven that even a joke can make a big splash. XRP (XRP) Imagine sending money across the world in seconds, without high fees or bank delays. That's the vision behind XRP, a digital currency created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. XRP operates on the XRP Ledger, a system that doesn't rely on any central authority. This means transactions are secure, can't be reversed, and don't even need a bank account to settle. With an initial supply of 100 billion coins, 80 billion were given to Ripple, the company dedicated to expanding XRP's reach. Ripple, formerly known as OpenCoin Inc., uses XRP to boost network liquidity and support the ecosystem, carefully releasing coins to keep the supply controlled. The name XRP comes from ""ripple credits,"" highlighting its goal to make moving money between different currencies seamless. In the current market cycle, XRP's focus on fast and low-cost transactions sets it apart from many other cryptocurrencies. Its technology aims to solve real-world problems by making cross-border payments more efficient. While some coins are known for high transaction fees and slow processing times, XRP offers a speedy and affordable alternative. This makes it particularly attractive as global commerce becomes more digital and interconnected. Market trends show a growing interest in cryptocurrencies that have practical applications, and XRP fits this mold. Its resistance to censorship and openness add to its appeal, suggesting that XRP could play a significant role in the future of digital finance. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that started as a joke, inspired by Dogecoin. But it's more than just a meme coin. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator known as Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with all the apps and tools that use Ethereum. When SHIB was created, there were a quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, to build trust. Buterin donated a large amount of SHIB to help with COVID relief in India. He also ""burned"" 40% of all SHIB tokens, which made the remaining tokens more valuable. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's connection to Ethereum allows it to do more than just be a coin. It has ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where people can trade coins without a middleman. There are also plans for a platform for NFTs and a system where holders can vote on changes, called a DAO. These features could make SHIB more useful and popular. In the current market, with interest in decentralized finance and NFTs growing, SHIB might have a chance to stand out. While many meme coins fade away, SHIB is trying to build real value. This makes it an interesting option for those looking at new opportunities in crypto. Conclusion ETH, DOGE, XRP, and SHIB are solid picks, but XYZVerse (XYZ) combines memes and sports, aiming for 20,000% growth, making it the top choice in the 2024 bull run.

Investors seeking the next bull wave are drawn to these currencies' high price targets, increased market traction, and new features. Here is how high they can go before the year ends. Rexas Finance (RXS): Ready to Leap From Under $0.10 to $16 Rexas Finance is making headlines for its swift presale success and innovative approach to blockchain-based asset tokenization. Rexas Finance uses cutting-edge blockchain technology to unlock unprecedented potential by providing investors with a stake in a burgeoning $486 trillion global market for tokenized assets. Experts predicted that Rexas Finance, currently priced at $0.08, might soon rally 200x to $16 for reasons ranging from its unique offer to anticipated grand listings. Rexas Finance provides access to high-value assets through fractional ownership. Buying, trading, and selling fractions of tokenized real-world assets like commodities and real estate democratizes investing. Blockchain's transparency and smart contract automation make transactions safe and fast, cutting costs and risks. RXS presale progress is excellent. As of this writing, Rexas Finance has completed five presale stages ahead of schedule, with Stage 6 at 94% complete. At $0.080 per token, RXS provides a lucrative entry point for early investors, with the following stage price expected to rise to $0.090. Over $11.4 million has been raised, with 189 million tokens traded, indicating high investor trust. When the presale closes, RXS will be listed on at least three tier-1 exchanges at $0.20, doubling its presale value. The project has completed important milestones, including a Certik audit. Certik, a blockchain security expert, confirms Rexas Finance's smart contracts and infrastructure, boosting investor confidence. Furthermore, recent listings on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap have increased RXS's awareness and solidified its market position. Rexas Finance is also running a $1 million giveaway to reach a larger audience. Twenty competitors will win $50,000 in RXS tokens, rewarding participation and supporting community growth. With strong fundamentals, a developing ecosystem, and anticipated strategic listings, analysts predict RXS will skyrocket to $16, representing a 20,000% increase from its initial presale price. XRP: Bulls Target $3 in 2024 XRP remains popular among investors, buoyed by hopes for regulatory certainty and network usefulness. As of writing, XRP is trading around $1.10, indicating a return of positive momentum after slight consolidation. Ripple's ongoing legal fights with the SEC have not detracted from its outstanding performance since whale activity and expanding use of RippleNet keep the currency relevant. Technical indicators show that XRP could reach $3 in 2024. A recent rise in whale activity has boosted confidence, with major investors buying millions of coins. Consistent increase in XRP transaction volume revealed by on-chain data points to increasing market activity. Moreover, XRP finds a convincing use in Ripple's cross-border payment systems and partnerships with financial institutions. The coin's capacity to enable quick and reasonably priced cross-border transactions guarantees its value in a market under competition. Altcoins like XRP are expected to follow Bitcoin toward $100,000, fueling the rally to reach the $3 target by 2024. Cardano (ADA): A 7x Rally on the Horizon Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain with scalability and sustainability promising a 7x price increase. As of writing, ADA is trading at $0.78, demonstrating incredible resiliency, boosted by increased developer engagement and ecosystem expansion. The token's fundamentals are as solid as ever. Cardano just reached 8,900 whale transactions for two weeks in a row, indicating significant accumulation by major investors. This trend coincides with a transaction volume increase of $52 billion, the most in seven months. Technical analysis predicts ADA will hit $2.10 by mid-2024. Cardano's Hydra scaling solution and close alliances position it to benefit from the crypto bull run. Analysts expect ADA to grow beyond $2.10 and possibly reach $5 if market conditions stay positive, delivering investors a high return. Conclusion The cryptocurrency sector is prepared for a watershed moment in 2024. XRP's ambitious $3 aim and Cardano's probable 7x surge highlight the market's optimism. However, Rexas Finance stands out as a game-changing investment opportunity, combining unique tokenization with quick presale growth and key milestones. For investors looking for life-changing gains, Rexas Finance has unrivaled potential. With a captivating idea, a strong ecosystem, and lofty projections, RXS is poised to be a star performer in the upcoming crypto cycle. Don't pass up the opportunity to join the presale and ride the wave of innovation and profitability.

MSTU's success is driven by fortunate timing, the emergence of single stock ETFs, and a significant Bitcoin rally influenced by a crypto-friendly Trump administration. Leveraged ETFs like MSTU can outperform their underlying assets significantly in low-volatility environments, as demonstrated by MSTU's more than 2x performance of MicroStrategy. Despite its impressive start, MSTU's future performance will be highly volatile and closely tied to Bitcoin's trajectory, offering both substantial upside and downside risks. For ETF issuers, the industry can be a fickle beast. Success is often dependent on factors that are outside of their control. If a fund launches at just the right time, it can come storming out of the gate. If it debuts right before a big market correction, its long-term track record could be tarnished for life. Even the most well-thought-out and backtested strategies can fail because they just failed to resonate with investors. Sometimes, it's just better to be lucky than good! If that's the case, the T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF ( MSTU ) may have just hit the perfect storm! For a little background, MSTU aims to deliver twice the daily performance of MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). It works just like most other leveraged ETF products in that it resets its exposure every day. Its expense ratio of 1.05% reflects the need to continuously reset the fund's positions and is roughly on par with other similar leveraged single stock ETFs. MSTU is just over two months old, having launched on September 18th, but in that short amount of time it's managed to amass one of the most impressive starts ever. Since inception, the ETF is up 800%! Data by YCharts Obviously, MSTU can thank the performance of MicroStrategy for its success, the stock having risen more than 200% over that time. The rally is heavily influenced by the current run towards $100,000 for bitcoin, and has happened in anticipation of a more crypto-friendly environment under the new Trump administration. You may look at the returns of MSTR & MSTU and wonder why the latter has more than tripled the performance of MicroStrategy if it's only leveraged by a factor of two. The answer is in the volatility or relative lack thereof. Volatility is the enemy of leveraged strategies. With high enough volatility, leveraged products can produce negative returns even if the underlying security has risen in value. Take, for example, the case of the Direxion Daily Financial Bull 3x Shares ETF ( FAS ) and the Direxion Daily Financial Bear 3x Shares ETF ( FAZ ) during the financial crisis. You might think that FAZ would have delivered through the roof returns, given the carnage in the banking sector. Actually, it didn't! Data by YCharts The fund did well for a little while, but then the impact of volatility took over. The whipsaw volatility severely degraded the fund's performance, and the downswings ultimately weighed more heavily on returns than the upswings. From their launches in late 2008 through the end of 2009, both FAS and FAZ delivered huge losses despite having opposite strategies. MicroStrategy, on the other hand, has enjoyed a ride with relatively few volatile moves. Granted, a ""small"" move in MSTR might be 3% in either direction, but the stock price generally moved higher consistently throughout these past two months. Without the volatility to degrade performance, MSTU was able to take advantage of leveraged gains upon leverage gains to generate more than 2x performance. 3 Factors That Drove MSTU's Huge Success 800% returns over the course of two months are obviously incredibly rare, so it's important to understand why the stars aligned for MSTU. Let's run through the three biggest reasons explaining how this all happened. Fortunate Timing For better or worse, investors are performance chasers. If something is rising in value, people are going to naturally gravitate towards it. In the ETF world, the difference between failure and success can be when the fund launches. Just ask the issuer of any fund that launched in the 1st quarter of 2020. Some of those funds have managed to survive and enjoy longer-term success, but for many that track record is going to be an immediate turnoff. MSTU couldn't have debuted at a better time. Data by YCharts MicroStrategy's stock had been moving sideways from March to September. MSTU launched on September 18th and caught the absolute beginning of the current rally. Even if the fund debuted at any point earlier in 2024, it still would've caught that rally (and the total return would have looked even better had it launched at the beginning of the year). But isn't it more impressive to be able to say that it was up 800% in just two months instead of 11? Emergence of Single Stock ETFs Just a couple of years ago, single stock ETFs weren't even a thing. Today, they're a $27 billion category with nearly 100 ETFs in total. Plus, with more than $17 billion in net inflows year-to-date, this is a rapidly growing category. Single Stock ETF Flows (Strategas) Without the desire by issuers to offer investors leveraged and short strategies on individual stocks without the need for a brokerage or margin account, MSTU would never exist in the first place. It's this theme of constant innovation and meeting the demand of regular investors that brings these products to market. Bitcoin Rally I suppose it goes without saying that MSTU's monster returns wouldn't have been possible without the current rally in bitcoin. Data by YCharts Bitcoin had been moving sideways for much of 2024, but got new life around election time. The next Trump administration is likely to be much more crypto-friendly and that's been the major catalyst for MicroStrategy's meteoric rise in recent months. A $3 Billion Giant All of these catalysts have conspired to create about the best start imaginable for a new ETF. In just two months, MSTU has gone from nothing to more than $3 billion at its peak. Data by YCharts The AUM total of any leveraged fund will be volatile, but especially one that's based on MicroStrategy. The current trajectory is very likely unsustainable, but the returns of MSTU will live and die with bitcoin. If you feel that bitcoin is the currency of the future and REALLY want to go all in, this fund may be better than bitcoin itself. Be prepared for a wild ride, though. MSTU has become the most volatile ETF in the marketplace and, although it hasn't experienced it yet, downside risk will be as substantial as upside potential.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740021-mstu-2x-microstrategy-etf-captures-lightning-in-bottle-turns-into-3-billion-behemoth?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36823211.jpeg

Currently Bitcoin has broken upwards through the descending trendline and is heading back for another attempt at $100,000. Will it break this huge psychological level this time? Bitcoin is heading back to higher levels once again, having made its customary reversal, thereby allowing the bulls to catch their breath before the next push up. Having just touched $99,000 early on Monday, it will not take a major surge to arrive back at the $100,000 psychological level again. Will the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs continue their huge buying spree? On the buying side, it will be interesting to see whether the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs will continue their run of five uninterrupted trading days of net inflows. Last Thursday saw a purchase of $1 billion alone. This is now the fourth time in Spot Bitcoin ETF history that a purchase of this magnitude has been made in just one day. Tether prints another $3 billion USDT As the institutions continue to buy, Tether continues to print stablecoins. It was reported by CoinTelegraph on Sunday that Tether had printed an additional $3 billion USDT; $2 billion of this on the Ethereum blockchain, and $1 billion on Tron. This now brings the total to $13 billion USDT printed by Tether since 11 November. Pro-crypto Trump picks In the United States, a pro-crypto Trump administration is continuing to take shape. Howard Lutnick (Commerce) and Scott Bessent (Treasury) are two crypto enthusiasts who have recently been Trump picks for the highest key posts in the country. As they have received word on their new positions, Janet Yellen , current Treasury Secretary, and opponent of crypto, is following Gary Gensler (SEC Chair) out of the door, as she tendered her resignation last week. $BTC breaks out of yet another bull flag Source: TradingView It does look like the latest small $BTC (BTC/USD) reversal was able to form a bull flag. This is only apparent on the short-term time frame, but the price has reacted perfectly for a flag, having broken out and retested the top. It would be likely that the $BTC would now rise to the high at $99,800, and by surpassing this, reach the $100,000 level. The Fibonacci levels for this move, starting from 17 November, show that the $BTC price has come down to the 0.382 Fibonacci level before bouncing. This is a bullish retracement, given that the price did not go to lower levels first. Bullish $BTC picture on the 2-week time frame Source: TradingView The 2-week chart for Bitcoin is looking very bullish indeed. The price has broken through the ascending trendline, which traverses both tops of the 2021 bull market, and with six days left before this 2-week candle closes, a close above this trendline, and also above the $100,000 horizontal level, would perhaps presage higher prices to come. The Stochastic RSI indicators at the bottom of the chart still have a way to go before reaching the top, and this would potentially mean a continuation of upside price momentum.

36822795,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654802,1732532734,"Ethereum Analyst Predicts $3,700 Once ETH Breaks Through Resistance","Ethereum has been trading at its highest levels since late July, hovering around $3,470. This marks a significant rebound for the second-largest cryptocurrency, which has managed to hold above the crucial 200-day moving average (MA) at $2,965. By maintaining this level, Ethereum confirmed a bullish price structure, paving the way for continued momentum as it approaches its next milestone—yearly highs near $4,000. Top analyst and investor Carl Runefelt recently shared his technical analysis on X, pointing out that Ethereum’s price action has built a solid foundation for further growth. According to Runefelt, Ethereum is poised for a substantial rally once it breaks above key resistance levels, signaling increased confidence among traders and investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Profit Hits ATH At $443 Million – Local Top Or Continuation? This bullish sentiment is further fueled by Ethereum’s consistent on-chain activity and growing institutional interest, which continue to support its upward trajectory. However, breaking past $4,000 will require Ethereum to overcome resistance zones that have historically triggered pullbacks. As ETH consolidates gains, market participants are watching closely for signs of the next breakout, which could set the tone for the remainder of the year. Ethereum’s recent strength underscores its role as a market leader and a bellwether for broader cryptocurrency trends. Ethereum Testing Crucial Supply Ethereum is testing a crucial supply zone just below the $3,500 level, a key resistance that could propel the cryptocurrency to yearly highs in the coming days. This level has become a focal point for traders and investors, as breaking it would likely signal a bullish continuation of Ethereum’s recent momentum. Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared his insights on X, emphasizing the significance of this resistance. According to his technical analysis, once Ethereum breaks through the $3,500 barrier, it could rapidly climb to $3,700, potentially within hours. The market sentiment surrounding Ethereum remains optimistic, with surging demand as a catalyst for further price gains. Ethereum’s strength at this critical level is also reigniting speculation about a possible Altseason. If ETH continues its upward trajectory and attracts more capital, it could pave the way for other altcoins to follow suit. Historically, Ethereum’s price action has been a leading indicator for broader market movements, and this time appears no different.

A strong push past $3,500 would confirm the bullish structure and set the stage for Ethereum to dominate market narratives in the weeks ahead. Key Levels To Watch Ethereum is trading at $3,470, hovering below the crucial $3,500 resistance level. This local high has become a key area of focus for traders and analysts, as breaking above it could set the stage for a significant rally. If Ethereum manages to push through this resistance with strength, it could trigger a breakout that propels the price toward $3,900 within days. However, the market remains cautious about the potential risks associated with this pivotal moment. A failed breakout at the $3,500 mark could lead to sideways consolidation as Ethereum seeks stronger buying pressure to resume its upward momentum. In a more bearish scenario, a substantial correction could occur, driving ETH back to lower levels to establish a more solid base of support.

A clean break above $3,500 would likely confirm Ethereum’s bullish structure and reinforce confidence in a continued uptrend. On the other hand, any hesitation or rejection at this level could signal the need for further consolidation before the next major move. As ETH approaches this critical juncture, the market is closely watching to determine its next direction and the potential implications for the broader crypto landscape.

Michael Saylor's strategy involves leveraging Bitcoin volatility, with significant gains from ATM and convertible bond offerings, projecting substantial long-term per-share value. Saylor's $13 million Bitcoin target by 2045 hinges on decreasing volatility and high annual returns, but historical bear markets pose significant risks. MSTR's rising average Bitcoin purchase price and potential 2025 liquidity issues could lead to financial strain, share dilution, and investor uncertainty. Thesis Summary MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is now the best-performing stock for the year and also the most traded. Enthusiasm for Bitcoin and MSTR is reaching a fever pitch as the world's premier cryptocurrency approaches $100,000. Michael Saylor, true to his word, just keeps on buying, but with every new purchase, the stock becomes more risky as MSTR's average price increases. Saylor has lofty price targets for Bitcoin, citing as high as $13 million per coin. In the very long run, maybe, but before that happens, Bitcoin will undergo its typical cycles. In my last MSTR article, I discussed the company's worst-case scenario, concluding bankruptcy was unlikely. However, as MSTR buys more Bitcoin at higher prices, it becomes more likely that MSTR's BTC position will be underwater in the next bear market. This could come as early as 2025 if we pay attention to liquidity dynamics, which is why I am downgrading MSTR to a sell. The MSTR Secret Sauce MicroStrategy ((MSTR)) has been on an ascent, taking the stock to pass the levels of the .com mania. MSTR Price (TV) A come-back story if there ever was one. In a recent interview, MSTR went into detail on how the company is creating value by ""selling volatility and recycling it back into Bitcoin."" He even concluded that the company had generated around $500 million per day, making it potentially the ""most profitable company in the United States,"" A couple of recent examples of how MSTR is doing this: At-The-Market Offering (ATM): The company executed a $4.6 billion ATM offering at a 70% Bitcoin spread, resulting in $3 billion in Bitcoin gains over five days. Saylor projected this would translate into $1,225 per share over 10 years. Convertible Bond Offering: MicroStrategy raised $3 billion at an 80% Bitcoin spread, producing $2.4 billion in Bitcoin gains. This was estimated to generate $125 per share over a decade. Source: Cryptoglobe.com We're not going to argue the merits of MSTR's strategy here, though I'm sure it will take up most of the comments section. I'm here to crunch some of my numbers. Crunching Some Numbers Michael Saylor's Bitcoin strategy makes perfect sense if you have the conviction that Bitcoin could reach $13 million per coin. My forecast is $13 million a coin by the year 2045, and what I tell everybody is every bitcoin you don't buy today is going to cost you $13 million in the future. Source. Saylor interview, Yahoo Finance Saylor seems to get to this valuation by applying some sort of Annual Return estimates. My long-term forecast is 21 years, 29% ARR. Right now we're 60% ARR, it will decelerate toward 20% ARR over the next 21 years, and the volatility will decelerate, Source. Saylor interview, Yahoo Finance Through this process, Saylor also expects volatility will decrease significantly. He better hope it does, or MSTR could be in big trouble. BTC LT Price chart (TV) The average Bitcoin bear market sees drawdowns of around 75%. Okay, maybe in the next 5-10 years Bitcoin will become a lot more stable, but a bear market could start according to halving cycle theory in 2025. If Saylor wants to use historical performance as a point of reference, then surely this is a valid point too. On the Hook For $4 Billion In my last article, we also crunched some numbers on MSTR, but a lot has changed since then. MSTR, true to its ethos, keeps buying Bitcoin, but this has drastically increased its average purchase price, which is now just below $50,000. As of right now, if an ""average"" bear market takes hold, then Bitcoin's price could easily dip below MSTR's average purchase price. More likely, a bear market could set in late 2025. The price of BTC will likely be higher by then, but then, of course, so will MSTR's average purchase price. When that time comes, will the company be able to afford a 75% or even a mere 50% drawdown in Bitcoin? From a literal perspective, likely not. MSTR convertible debt (10Q) MSTR has financed a lot of its Bitcoin purchases through convertible notes, which is all fine as long as the share price remains above the conversion price. We have issues dating into 2031, with convertible prices around the $200 level. This is stay way in the future, but consider that merely a month ago MSTR was trading below $200. The problem here is that if MSTR actually has to pay back the convertible, it will need to put together around $4 billion. It currently holds $46.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. Therefore, as mentioned above, Saylor can't afford a bear market. Eventually, MSTR would be forced to find financing, which could prove hard, or issue more equity. As I concluded in my last article, I don't think MSTR is at risk of bankruptcy or anything, but shareholders could be in for a wild ride. 2025 Liquidity Headwinds To close this out, let's talk about Bitcoin and liquidity. It's no secret that Bitcoin has become a liquidity proxy. Bitcoin price (Refinitiv) In the long run, I agree with Saylor. Bitcoin is a great way to hedge against higher liquidity, which I expect will continue to trend up. However, liquidity is also cyclical, and 2025 could be a year where liquidity conditions tighten, as both the economy and the Federal government will have to undergo significant re-financing. From the corporate side, we have a lot of the debt acquired during COVID which will be coming due in 2025-26. Debt maturity wall (Bloomberg) This debt was taken on at historically low rates, but this time, corporations won't be so lucky. And the same can be applied to the Federal deficit. Interest payments on federal debt (CBO) Interest as a % of payments could skyrocket as the government has to refinance at higher rates. Both of these events will serve to drain liquidity, and unless the Federal Reserve steps in, this could put a dampener on markets, and more notably, Bitcoin. Final Thoughts I don't disagree with Saylor that Bitcoin is a great asset to hold, long-term, but that doesn't mean that MSTR can just keep appreciating from here. The way I see it, as MSTR's average purchase price increases, so does the risk that Bitcoin falls below this price, which increases the risk that investors sell, and then increases the risk that the convertibles will have to be paid out in cash, leading to share dilution.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740018-microstrategy-saylor-cant-afford-a-bear-market?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36822770.jpeg

Meanwhile, theories about BTC’s next move are also running rampant, especially after the crypto’s recent rally. Some analysts predict Bitcoin will hit a six-figure valuation by the end of 2024, boosted by inflows into ETFs. VanEck also recently reaffirmed its $180K price prediction for Bitcoin. AI-driven fund Intelligent Alpha is also exploring BTC’s potential, and predicted a rise to $140K under favorable conditions. Theory Suggests Satoshi Is Selling Old Stash A new theory surrounding the identity of Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, has emerged. The theory suggests that Nakamoto might have been strategically liquidating Bitcoin holdings from early wallets since 2019. According to a Nov. 19 post by Bitcoin research firm BTCparser, several Bitcoin wallet addresses from 2010, each holding 50 BTC, stayed dormant until what they referred to as the “2010 megawhale” began moving coins in November of 2019. The researchers propose that Nakamoto may be behind these wallets, and has been carefully selling the holdings while avoiding transactions from the original 2009 wallets. This was likely done to stay anonymous and to avoid drawing attention to the primary stash. BTCparser’s theory paints a picture of a well planned effort by Nakamoto to preserve privacy. By using the 2010 wallets instead of the original 2009 addresses, the Bitcoin creator could effectively liquidate funds without risking identification. The coins were reportedly pooled into a single P2SH address before being distributed to multiple bech32 addresses, known for their efficiency and low transaction costs. The first recorded sale happened in November of 2019, and involved $5 million worth of Bitcoin. More sales followed, and included transactions ranging from $6–8 million in March of 2020, $11–13 million in October of 2020, and a larger $176 million liquidation on Nov. 15 of 2024. These increasing sales volumes seem to align with Bitcoin's rising market value, which suggests that the whale is taking a strategic approach to cashing out. BTCparser indicated that Coinbase, which was the exchange used to liquidate these funds, might hold critical information about the individual or entity behind the transactions unless intermediaries were used to obscure the trail. This theory is the latest development in the ongoing speculation about Satoshi’s identity, which has included figures like Peter Todd , Nick Szabo, Adam Back , and Hal Finney. While a recent HBO documentary controversially claimed Todd invented Bitcoin, he and others dismissed these conclusions as baseless. For now, the debate over Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity remains unresolved. Bitcoin on Track for a Six-Figure New Year? While theories about Bitcoin’s creator are still being debated, BTC’s next move is also being theorized about. Bitcoin’s price trajectory recently captured a lot of attention as prediction markets suggest a strong likelihood of the crypto reaching six figures by the end of 2024. (Bitcoin price predictions on Kalshi ) Data from the betting platform Kalshi indicates an 87% probability that Bitcoin will surpass $100,000 by Dec. 31, with a median forecast placing the price at $125,000. There is also a 7% chance of Bitcoin climbing to $150,000, and even an outside prediction of $250,000 or higher. The Kobeissi Letter revealed that figures like these imply a potential Bitcoin market cap of $2.5 trillion by Jan. 1 . Bitcoin has already seen remarkable gains this quarter after rising close to 40% in November alone and 55% in Q4 overall, according to CoinGlass . These gains happened with minimal consolidation or retests of support since the crypto broke its previous all-time high in March. While some analysts argue that a price retracement is necessary to sustain further growth, Bitcoin still defied expectations. Institutional inflows played a crucial role in Bitcoin’s performance, and were fueled largely by the rise of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Onchain analytics firm Glassnode shared that ETFs absorbed over 90% of sell-side pressure from long-term holders who started distributing coins that were held for years as unrealized profits reach higher levels. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) Despite this, ETF inflows managed to offset a lot of the selling pressure, and U.S.-based Bitcoin ETFs recently recorded their most successful inflow week since launch. Assets under management for these ETFs even surpassed $100 billion. VanEck Reaffirms $180K Bitcoin Forecast Global investment manager VanEck also recently reaffirmed its ambitious $180,000 price target for Bitcoin, and even predicted that the next phase of the crypto bull market is only beginning. In a Nov. 21 report , VanEck digital asset analysts Nathan Frankovitz and Matthew Sigel attributed their bullish outlook to an increasingly favorable regulatory landscape in the United States, as well as heightened institutional interest. They believe these factors could propel Bitcoin to $180,000 in the next 18 months. The report also mentioned that Trump’s recent election victory acted as a catalyst for Bitcoin's latest surge, which saw its price reach a peak of $99,800. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $98,286 after its price managed a small 0.10% increase over the past 24 hours. This means that BTC is still close to the psychological milestone of $100,000. Bitcoin’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The analysts noticed that Bitcoin entered a new market phase on Nov. 11, marked by funding rates on perpetual futures contracts exceeding 10%. Historically, elevated funding rates indicated stronger short- to medium-term momentum and higher returns over the next 30 to 90 days. However, they warned that sustained high funding rates could lead to underperformance for longer-term returns. Purchases made during periods of funding rates above 10% shoed diminishing performance over the 180-day, one-year, and two-year timeframes. While many market experts anticipate Bitcoin to surpass $100,000 by year-end, some analysts suggest that the milestone could be reached in the next week, especially considering the current bullish sentiment and market momentum. AI-Powered Fund Predicts Bitcoin's Path to $140K Intelligent Alpha is a unique $30 million investment fund that adopted a groundbreaking approach by delegating all major investment decisions to artificial intelligence (AI). The firm is led by founder and CEO Doug Clinton, and operates with a small human team of programmers and contractors, while the core investment committee consists of three AIs: OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude. These AIs collaboratively analyze data, and make strategic investment decisions. The AI-driven fund delivered some impressive results so far, particularly in shorting stocks. In fact, the AIs accurately predicted quality issues with Boeing’s 737 MAX and shorted the stock before a serious incident earlier this year. Boeing 737 MAX door blowout (Source: BBC News ) While the fund predominantly focused on traditional finance, Clinton recently introduced Bitcoin trading into the mix. In exploring bitcoin’s potential, the AI models have considered a range of scenarios. In a bullish case involving favorable regulatory conditions and a Trump presidency, the models projected Bitcoin could potentially rise to $140,000. The firm provides the AIs with curated datasets, like historical revenue and earnings projections for large-cap U.S. equities. To guide decision-making, the AIs are asked to adopt the philosophies of renowned investors like Warren Buffett and Cathie Wood. Once the AIs generate a portfolio, humans step in to validate it to make sure no errors or “hallucinations” have occurred. Clinton acknowledges the surprising and sometimes counterintuitive picks made by the AIs, but shared that the process is improved when AIs articulate their reasoning. This not only clarifies their logic but also results in improved portfolio quality. The firm has experimented with other AI models like Grok and Lama AI but found the current trio to be the most effective and efficient team.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6193/theory-suggests-satoshi-nakamoto-may-still-be-active-in-bitcoin-market,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

GBTC, without a discount to NAV to take advantage of, and higher expense ratios than alternatives, is simply unattractive. Tax-wise, GBTC remains quite okay, but is likely to see decreasing liquidity as outflows continue to more competitive options. I believe Bitcoin is relatively fairly to fully valued at this stage, and after a 600%+ run-up in GBTC, it'd be wise to trim positions, take profits, and redistribute to other asset classes and funds. My last article on Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) was published nearly two years ago now, and we used to cover the discount to NAV, saying we'd switch away from this fund/ETF and into alternatives given the discount to NAV closing, with the caveat that we'd rate the fund a buy once again if GBTC hit a 40-42%+ discount to NAV. This occurred in the following month, and we switched our ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) holdings back into GBTC. Since then, the stock has moved 600%+, after another good opportunity to trade the discount to NAV and a clear shift in the chance of approval followed by a swift approval of the fund's conversion to an ETF - closing the discount to NAV gap we enjoyed for so long. Coming up on 2025 it's now been about a year since the majority of the discount to NAV has been closed, so it's important to revisit this position and see if we should keep it around, switch it out, or exit our exposure entirely. Is Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF still one of the best vehicles for exposure into the crypto market? Let's see. The Bitcoin Component As Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) itself is up drastically since the last article (300%+), and just broadly in recent history, I believe it's important to address the valuation of the asset generally before we get into the specifics about GBTC as an investment vehicle. Bitcoin is no longer in a bear market and hated, it's moved from one of the most hated sectors to one of the most beloved - among all but those who had no position. Returns have been phenomenal - truly, especially for us, who got back in at the lows. However, the future from here is far more uncertain - the relative value of Bitcoin just isn't as great as it once was, the risk reward dynamics of the market have changed, and this is one of the factors prompting this downgrade to an avoid/liquidate (sell) rating. Obviously, if bitcoin continues to rise, GBTC will continue to perform quite well as well. However, it's important to acknowledge we're no longer in the phase of the market we were in 2022. GBTC vs Alternatives With that being said, let's discuss GBTC as an investment vehicle TODAY vs the alternatives on the market, as before we were stuck with just a closed-end fund that traded at a heavy discount, and didn't track bitcoin's performance very well, and a bitcoin futures ETF ('BITO') that tracked it a bit better but fundamentally was not bitcoin and had structural issues as well. That's all changed now that GBTC was allowed to convert from a closed-end fund to an ETF, and numerous other bitcoin ETFs were approved. The market has matured and has become much more efficient. Data by YCharts This is evident by the chart above - which shows the total return (adjusted for dividends in the case of $BITO) for the last few months. As you can see, all the bitcoin funds/ETFs are beginning to track bitcoin very accurately now that the initial major inflows/outflows have occurred and discount/premiums to NAV have closed across all funds. With that being said, the performance shown above is not necessarily how it looks. GBTC vs BITO The worst performer above was ProShares Bitcoin ETF, which may look to have only underperformed by a hair relative to the other bitcoin ETFs. However, this is NOT accounting for taxes. That's because the above chart was based on the stock's total return, and BITO, unlike spot bitcoin ETFs that hold actual bitcoin, they still hold bitcoin futures. ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO) holdings (Proshares Website) Instead, BITO mirrors bitcoins price action via futures, which on the surface isn't actually an issue - I didn't mind it for a long time, however due to this, and some regulations, they're forced to pay out dividends (according to ProShares) to account for the capital gains the fund accrues, which means less compounding and, for most people, higher taxes. Combine this with BITO's expense ratio of 0.95% annually, and it's not a better alternative to GBTC in my view (due to taxes), unless of course someone wants to play with options on bitcoin - but in that case, I'd prefer to just go straight to the futures as the stock has a certain level of uncertainty regarding future dividend payment amounts, and thus how they'll affect price. GBTC vs IBIT The other bitcoin ETF that interests me and is worth considering instead of GBTC would be iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), as it currently has the lowest expense ratio (0.12%) in the sector and the highest AUM. Conveniently, it has also performed the best in the last few months, albeit but a slim margin. IBIT holds actual bitcoin - spot bitcoin, with the same custodian as Grayscale has (Coinbase) so you're really comparing apples to apples here and there's not much more to talk about than their expense ratios: For Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF, it's a blistering 1.5% annually, and for iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, it's a comfortable 0.12% annually, and really that's all there is to be said about it. Do you want to pay 10x in management fees for essentially exactly the same product? I don't, and as a result, to me, if someone wants to buy a Bitcoin ETF, it'd make sense to just opt for IBIT from this point forward. This is especially true as the SEC greenlit IBIT for options approval back in September , and with it having the biggest AUM and lowest fees, it'll have the best options liquidity moving forward once the options begin to be traded. It's simply the best ETF for spot bitcoin exposure - or, in my opinion, bitcoin exposure period. Where does this leave us? This might make you think I'm saying to flee GBTC for greener pastures such as IBIT, however there are some important considerations before doing so - namely taxes. If you've held your GBTC for If you've held your GBTC for >1 year and would be subject to long-term capital gains, you still have to ask yourself how much are you up? From the looks of it, you're likely sitting up over 160% on the position, unless you bought it pre-2023. Does it really make sense to sell it and convert it to IBIT and pay taxes on the gains today? Well, that's something only you can answer - and it's a tough question to answer, but moving forward there is one thing that's quite certain in my view, and that's that any extra DCAing or additions should likely go into IBIT instead of into GBTC. Rating & Risks to Consider Before closing out the article, I'd like to clarify some risks to consider as well as clarify my rating for the GBTC moving forward. I'd like to restate once again that there are potential tax consequences in swapping GBTC out for IBIT that would make it a bad choice for you personally - please do not follow what we are doing, we have different circumstances, risk tolerance, and likely tax positioning than you do. With that being said, we'd rate GBTC at a sell relative to Bitcoin given the fact that there's simply better ETFs with lower expense ratios on the market now, and given that we believe Bitcoin is quite fairly to fully valued at this moment in our view we'd rate it relative to dollars or other equities as a modest sell, meaning we'd trim any position we have or liquidate it depending on other market opportunities. We'd change our rating of GBTC to a hold if the fund adjusts their fees downward below a 0.3% expense ratio - which is in the middle to lower bracket of expense ratios for Bitcoin funds currently.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740016-gbtc-its-time-to-move-on-from-this-etf-downgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36822353.jpeg
36822256,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102701,1732531511,Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Could Surge 150% to $170K After $100K Milestone,"Bitcoin is rapidly approaching a key milestone of $100,000, and analysts are now predicting a potential surge of up to 150%, pushing its value to $170,000. Bitcoin continues to dominate market attention as it inches closer to a groundbreaking $100,000 valuation. On Friday, the cryptocurrency nearly touched $99,800 before retreating slightly over the weekend. As of the latest updates, Bitcoin’s price stands at $98,337.84, representing a modest 0.14% gain over the past 24 hours. Over the past week, the asset has climbed by 7.19%, reflecting robust upward momentum in the market.Analyst Roadmap Suggests Potential $170KAmid this movement, market analysts are closely watching Bitcoin's trajectory. A notable roadmap outlined by Egrag Crypto on X suggests a possible surge toward $170,000, albeit not without potential retracement. The outlined scenario projects that Bitcoin could first surpass $100,000, reaching $102,000 to $104,000 before a significant pullback. This correction might align with the CME gap observed between $78,000 and $80,000, a commonly tracked price level on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Bitcoin futures chart.Further analysis indicates that dropping below $73,000 on higher timeframes might trigger cascading sell-offs. This could lead to a retest of prior breakout levels before a sharp recovery. The roadmap draws parallels with Bitcoin’s price movements during the 2017-2018 cycle, suggesting the possibility of history repeating itself. Meanwhile, according to Moustache, an analyst on X, Bitcoin's monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has recently surpassed the 70 level. The analyst pointed out that historically, this threshold has often been followed by significant price increases and the final peak of a market cycle. This indicator has created anticipation about potential market movements in the coming weeks and months.Strengthening Bullish BehaviorData from CryptoQuant highlights bullish patterns in Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics, suggesting the ongoing rally may still be in its early stages. The platform’s Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator has shifted into a bullish zone, mirroring conditions observed in early 2020. This trend preceded a significant price surge for Bitcoin, providing context for the current market behavior.Recent whale accumulation has further bolstered market confidence. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju emphasized that these large-scale purchases are driving the rally. Once dismissed as exaggerated, the data now aligns with the sustained uptick in market activity, suggesting renewed investor confidence.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/25/analyst-predicts-bitcoin-could-surge-150-to-170k-after-100k-milestone/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-predicts-bitcoin-could-surge-150-to-170k-after-100k-milestone,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

However, the trendline breakout rally failed to sustain above the 23.60% Fibonacci level, priced at $0.04474, resulting in the 6.16% pullback today.Meanwhile, the increased demand for VET has resulted in an uptick in the 50-week EMA line, creating a golden crossover.

Hence, the technical indicators maintain a buy signal for VeChain.Analyst Predicts Flag Breakout Rally to $0.056With three consecutive bullish weeks, the trend reversal in VeChain shows strong bullish price action on a larger timeframe. In a recent X post , crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a breakout rally in VeChain that could change the short-term dynamics.Martinez's analysis highlights a bullish flag breakout, with VET surpassing the 78.60% Fibonacci level at $0.043. The price action analysis is done in the 1-hour timeframe and suggests the uptrend continuation to $0.056.

36822252,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102676,1732530273,Expert Says Pepe Will Outperform Dogecoin and Shiba Inu This Cycle,"Max Schwartzman, the CEO of BecauseBitcoin, has shared an indication of the bull cycle’s peak, citing the performance of the largest meme coins Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe. The meme coin sector has been one of the standout narratives in this bull cycle. Strong performances from Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe have seen the meme sector trade at a market cap of $132 billion.For context, Dogecoin, Pepe, and Shiba Inu have respectively surged 221%, 125%, and 53% in the past 30 days. Other meme coins like Bonk and Floki Inu have also performed impressively, appreciating 124% and 81.5%, respectively.Amid the notable upticks, BecauseBitcoin founder Max Scwartzman has shared his meme coin play for the cycle, including a possible scenario where Pepe will outpace Dogecoin. He also predicted how the meme sector will determine Bitcoin’s market top.Schwartzman Shares Alpha-Beta Cycle PlayIn a Nov. 23 tweet , Schwartzman asserted which meme coin was alpha and beta in this bull cycle. He stated that while the previous cycle was Dogecoin (alpha) against Shiba Inu (beta), this period would be the former against the third-largest meme coin by market cap, Pepe.The CEO asserts that Dogecoin is the alpha and Pepe the beta for this bull run, insisting that the relationship between the two tokens is the “secret sauce in crypto.” Per the analysis, Schwartzman speculated that Pepe will be the best-performing token in the meme category this cycle.Cycle Top When Pepe Flips DogecoinNotably, the market typically shows an interesting trend between alphas and betas and how they determine the cycle top. He pointed to an occurrence in the previous cycle as his basis for using the analogy to determine the market top.The BecauseBitcoin CEO stated that Bitcoin peaked last cycle when Shiba Inu’s market cap flipped Dogecoin’s. The expert insisted that although betas are allowed to topple alphas for a short time, sustained overperformance signals the market is a “house of cards about to collapse.”As a result, he insisted he would leave the crypto market when Pepe’s market cap flipped Dogecoin’s later in the cycle. In the meantime, he advised his massive audience to enjoy the ride up, as both tokens would surge together for now.Notably, Pepe has been teased to perform outstandingly this cycle, with an analyst predicting it will mirror Shiba Inu’s 2021 explosion. The analysis came following PEPE’s listing on Coinbase and Robinhood .In the meantime, PEPE trades at $0.00002052, down 9% in the past seven days.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/25/expert-says-pepe-will-outperform-dogecoin-and-shiba-inu-this-cycle/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-says-pepe-will-outperform-dogecoin-and-shiba-inu-this-cycle,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Will the uptrend reach $4.53? WorldCoin is one of the high-ranking altcoins in the Ethereum ecosystem. With a market cap of $1.778 billion, it ranks among the top 65 cryptocurrencies. Over the past 7 days, it has increased by 12.83%, with the trading volume exceeding its current market cap. With its 24-hour trading volume exceeding $1 billion, will this massive surge result in a parabolic jump in WorldCoin prices? Worldcoin Price AnalysisIn the daily chart, the WLD price action shows a recovery rally at play. With two diverging trendlines, the recovery rally forms a broadening wedge pattern. Despite multiple higher price rejections from its overhead resistance trendline, the recovery rally is going strong. Over the past six days, it has made consecutive bullish candles and has registered a growth of 23.14%. Worldcoin Price Chart The recovery rally streak of consecutive bullish candles started from the $2.12 support zone and the 100-day EMA. The price surge has surpassed the 200-day EMA line and is ready to challenge the resistance trendline. From the $1.28 bottom in September, Worldcoin has surged by 102% within 80 days. The increased bullish influence has resulted in a merger of the 50-day and 100-day EMA line, teasing a positive crossover. The MACD and signal lines maintain a positive alignment after avoiding the recent bearish crossover, supporting the bullish trend. Further, the rising positive histograms reveal this gradual surge in trend momentum. Analyst Predicts a Worldcoin Rally Free of Supply BarriersSupporting the bullish trend, crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently stated that WorldCoin faces “no significant supply barriers ahead.” Using the global in-and-out-of-money indicator, Martinez highlighted that 95.86% of the volume is “in the money,” suggesting minimal resistance for the WLD price.Therefore, the uptrend is likely to continue toward the $10 psychological mark. However, for the bull run to sustain, WorldCoin must maintain the $2.10 support level.Worldcoin Price Targets $2.95 Breakout Run To $4.53Based on the price action analysis, the uptrend is heading to challenge the resistance at $2.95. This level combines the rising resistance trendline and a previous swing high, marking a key supply zone. A breakout above this critical level could trigger a significant surge toward $4.53.On the other hand, should the bullish trend retrace, it may test the $2.53 support level or the 50-day EMA at $2.13.",POSITIVE,WLD,ALTCOIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | WLD,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/25/analyst-predicts-smooth-ride-for-worldcoin-is-4-53-target-within-reach/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-predicts-smooth-ride-for-worldcoin-is-4-53-target-within-reach,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Some issuers of memecoins on Solana's runaway hit Pump.fun have been streaming videos ranging from extreme dark humor to dark behavior, all to pump their tokens to a few million dollars in market capitalization.  There are streams and images of children tied up, a man locked up in his toilet continuously, killing of hens, fetish videos and softcore porn. Live streaming on the platform was a feature added last week. (Hours after this story was initially published, Pump.fun announced that it was ""pausing the live streaming functionality on the site for an indefinite time period until the moderation infrastructure is ready to deal with the heightened levels of activity."")  Some tokens even have images of a human slashing forearms or playing with fire (though these are quickly taken down). One person was allegedly firing a gun outside their window every time his token zoomed higher. This sort of shock factor can lead to viral content, drawing in more viewers and potential investors.  It isn’t all bad, however. Most of the streams are harmless or contain fun activities such as drawing an egg or talking to an audience. Users have to specifically switch on an “NSFW” tag to land up on questionable content.  Most of the dark tokens don’t have an X page, and their issuers have not publicly shared why they choose to engage in extreme behavior. Memecoins often thrive on internet culture, humor, cuteness, and virality — but such acts may cross a line for what’s considered a harmless act for a meme. Such activities can even draw negative attention from mainstream media.  X users are also reporting some dark streams, such as suicidal streams, death threats, and animal porn among others. (CoinDesk could not independently verify these posts, or if Pump.fun’s moderation team likely took them down.)    Pump.fun lets anyone issue a token for less than $2 in capital, after which they choose the number of tokens, theme, and meme picture to accompany it. When the market capitalization of any token reaches $69,000, a portion of liquidity is deposited to the Solana-based exchange Raydium and burned.  Pump.fun is among the most-used applications in the industry and the biggest revenue generator across all user apps.  To be clear, Pump.fun has no role in the type of streams users choose to do and has an active moderation team that takes down dark or malicious content. Pump has been moderating platform activity since it started.    “We actively moderate illicit content on the site. That includes images, videos, live streams, and comments,” Pump founder @a1lon9 wrote in an X post over the weekend. “Although we strongly stand for free speech and expression, it's our responsibility to ensure that users don't see clearly repulsive/dangerous content and that bad actors aren't given a platform to act as they wish.”  “If you're aware of a coin where moderation isn't enforced, please report it in our support channels immediately,” he added.  Crypto Twitter largely condemns such behavior, however. No influential X account is chiding on issuers of such tokens to continue engaging in their activities, and most of these tokens are failing to break even a $50,000 market capitalization (viral and positive tokens on Pump.fun can easily break $1 million in a few hours).  Meanwhile, sentiment for Pump.fun has largely dived negative amid everything taking place on the platform.   UPDATE (Nov. 24, 2024, 20:10 UTC): Adds that Pump.fun has now paused live streaming on its site.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RAY,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/11/25/crypto-gets-shock-video-dose-as-users-stream-nsfw-content-to-pump-their-memecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1151cc8aa97624701ebf814eb3b649f8bd6a995-3683x2946.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With the bitcoin (BTC) bull market in full swing, Koreans are again diving in head first and snapping up smaller cryptocurrencies.  Trading volume on South Korea's largest exchange, Upbit, which accounts for over 70% of the country's total activity, has skyrocketed 11-fold to $14.3 billion since the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election that saw pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump emerge victorious, according to data source Coingecko.  Driving this exceptional volume growth are XRP, dogecoin (DOGE) and other smaller tokens, pointing to a resurgence of retail investor mania.  For instance, the DOGE/KRW pair, which represents dogecoin's price in South Korean won, has been the most traded pair on Upbit for a total of 10 days, according to 10x Research. The XRP/KRW pair has been top six times and the XLM/KRW pair has been the most traded pair of the past 24 hours, accounting for 19% of the total volume Sunday.  The three tokens have skyrocketed by 164%, 188% and 463%, respectively, this month, though they remain below their respective record highs reached in 2021. Meanwhile, market leader bitcoin is trading at lifetime peaks near $100,000, representing a near 40% price gain, according to CoinDesk data.  ""Since the Nov. 5 Trump election, bitcoin's dominance as the crypto with the highest volume has been replaced by altcoins, such as Doge, Ripple, and Stellar (XLM 19% market share on UPbit on Sunday, number 1 coin traded). Those are the ones with +100% returns, and while simply monitoring those changes in activity would have resulted in a lot of alpha, as we have frequently pointed out,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients Monday.  Koreans' love for cheaper plays is now extending to other crypto market sectors, including metaverse tokens like SAND, which are seeing a meaningful rally for the first in three years.  At press time, the SAND/KRW pair listed on Upbit boasted a 24-hour trading volume of $2 billion, or 14% of the exchange's total trading volume of $14.10 billion.  The SAND token has rallied over 200% to 76 cents this month, yet it remains well below its November 2021 peak of $8.49.

He noted that the concept would have been insurmountable a few years ago, but “with many projects banding together” on the ecosystem, the milestone has become attainable.However, the lead placed a clause on the ambitious burn milestone.

He argued that if the meme coin has a real-world use case, the ecosystem will thrive so much that users would not want to burn their tokens.Notably, the lead had earlier emphasized the importance of mainstream adoption for the Shiba Inu ecosystem.

First announced in July, the lending initiative will start with $2 billion in funds, which could eventually grow to tens of billions of dollars. Tether’s potential inclusion in the project signals a deepening of the relationship between the stablecoin issuer and the trading firm.  Cantor — which has been the custodian for Tether’s U.S. Treasuries since 2021 — has also acquired a 5% stake in Tether, which issues the USDT stablecoin, worth around $600 million, according to the same report.  Tether operates the world’s most widely used stablecoin. Referenced to the U.S. dollar, it has a market cap of $132.76 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.  But the token has drawn scrutiny for its use by illicit actors, including those involved in scams, money laundering and sanctions evasion. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported Tether was under investigation in the U.S. for possible violations of sanctions and anti-money laundering rules.  Tether branded the report “irresponsible” and accused detractors of glossing over its history of working with law enforcement and its efforts to crack down on misuse.  Under the Biden administration, several cryptocurrency firms faced regulatory crackdowns. Trump’s administration has indicated it will reverse course, with the president-elect and his family having launched several cryptocurrency projects, most recently World Liberty Financial.  Within Trump’s circle are several crypto advocates including Lutnick himself, who has taken on a key role in Trump’s team. He is currently serving as co-chair of the transition team and last week became Trump’s pick to lead the U.S.Department of Commerce, a role that would position him to influence the U.S. crypto landscape.

36818049,https://coinpaprika.com/news/cardano-founder-slams-wyoming-stablecoin-process,1732522960,Cardano Founder Slams Wyoming Stablecoin Process,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has voiced strong concerns about the Wyoming stablecoin project, alleging unfair practices and procedural misconduct. During a November 25 livestream, Hoskinson detailed how the project, which he and Input Output Global (IOG) supported for over a year, excluded Cardano and other blockchain platforms from consideration, raising questions about fairness and legality. Hoskinson recalled the initial optimism surrounding the Wyoming legislature’s crypto law, which aimed to create a state-backed stablecoin. He said IOG played a significant role during the project’s development, offering advice on compliance, issuance processes, and strategies to compete with established stablecoins like Circle and Tether. Despite their involvement, Hoskinson criticized the appointment of an executive director from the Ethereum ecosystem who prioritized Ethereum over the multi-chain approach originally intended by the bill's authors. He claimed the selection process for blockchain platforms was unfair, describing it as opaque and biased. According to Hoskinson, Cardano was excluded without any opportunity to appeal or demonstrate its capabilities. “The process gave an unfair competitive advantage to other ecosystems,” he stated, calling it both illegal and unconstitutional. He also noted that thousands of other blockchain platforms were similarly excluded, undermining Wyoming’s reputation as a leader in crypto innovation. Hoskinson highlighted the broader implications of these actions, warning that Wyoming risks losing its position as a crypto-friendly state if such practices continue. “If Wyoming wants to retain crypto businesses, it must uphold the rule of law and ensure fair treatment,” he emphasized. He mentioned that several Wyoming lawmakers share his concerns and are questioning whether the project should be repealed or defunded. Despite his frustrations, Hoskinson reaffirmed his commitment to Wyoming, where IOG has made significant investments. He expressed hope for a resolution, stating that IOG is exploring all options, including potential legal action . “This is just the beginning; we’ll get it sorted out,” he declared, emphasizing his intent to pursue justice. Hoskinson’s remarks reflect his dedication to ensuring fair competition and maintaining Wyoming’s standing as a hub for blockchain innovation. He warned that without adherence to the rule of law, Wyoming could lose its appeal to crypto businesses, jeopardizing its future in the industry.",NEGATIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | USDT,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/cardano-founder-slams-wyoming-stablecoin-process,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36818049.jpeg

Originally intended to help developers promote their coins, the feature has instead been exploited for harmful acts, including threats of violence, financial scams, and inappropriate content. These issues have sparked outrage within the community, leading to calls for stricter moderation or even the removal of the livestream option altogether. Since its launch earlier this year, Pump.fun has gained traction as a user-friendly platform for creating and launching meme coins. Despite its controversies, the platform has generated $215 million in revenue and facilitated the creation of over 3.8 million meme coins. However, its livestream feature has become a focal point of criticism due to alarming incidents involving extreme and dangerous behavior. One disturbing case involved a developer livestreaming threats of self-harm if his cryptocurrency did not reach a specific market capitalization. Similarly, other users have issued threats of violence toward pets or people to pressure investors into supporting their projects. These actions have raised serious concerns about user safety and the platform’s credibility. A particularly shocking incident was reported by Beau, a safety project manager at Pudgy Penguins, who highlighted a livestream where an individual threatened to harm themselves if their coin failed to achieve a financial goal. “Shut down the livestream feature. This is out of control,” Beau stated, reflecting the frustration shared by many in the community. In addition to harmful acts, the platform has become a breeding ground for financial scams. A recent example involved a young user who created a meme coin called QUANT, quickly raised $30,000, and then abandoned the project, leaving investors with worthless tokens. This led to the public exposure of the individual’s personal information, escalating the situation further. Community members are divided on how to address the problem. While some advocate for shutting down Pump.fun entirely, others suggest disabling or moderating the livestream feature as a more balanced approach. Eddie, a legal intern, criticized the platform’s lack of effective governance and noted that much of the content on livestreams is “conceptually lazy” and harmful. “There’s an art to creating engaging content, but what we see on Pump.fun is neither creative nor interesting—it’s dangerous,” Eddie remarked. Pump.fun executives have defended the platform, emphasizing their efforts to moderate content. Alon, an executive at Pump.fun, explained that a team of moderators and engineers work around the clock to address these issues. “Our moderation isn’t perfect, but we’re constantly improving. If users notice violations, we urge them to report them immediately,” Alon stated. The situation highlights a broader dilemma for Pump.fun: balancing creative freedom with user safety. While the platform offers users unique opportunities to innovate, the lack of effective controls has led to serious consequences. The community is now demanding decisive action to safeguard users and restore trust in the platform. Despite the controversies, Pump.fun continues to thrive financially. Since March 2024, the platform has achieved significant success, earning $215 million and enabling the deployment of millions of meme coins. However, without stronger moderation, its reputation and long-term sustainability remain at risk .",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | OTHER,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/pump-fun-faces-backlash-over-livestream-misuse,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36817756.jpeg

Pal made this assertion during a recent market analysis , in which he compared Dogecoin’s historical price performance with Bitcoin. Notably, Pal confirmed that Dogecoin has performed better than Bitcoin since its launch in December 2013.Dogecoin Has Outperformed Bitcoin Since LaunchFor context, Dogecoin debuted with a market price of $0.00056 in December 2013. However, the meme coin soared to a new peak of $0.0187 in January 2018 before retracing and consolidating for over two years.Amid Elon Musk’s comments , Dogecoin skyrocketed to a new all-time high of $0.7390 in May 2021 during the bull run at the time. Following a correction in 2020 and early 2023, DOGE has now recovered some of its losses, having skyrocketed to the current price of $0.4270.At the current price, Dogecoin has increased 76,150% since its debut in December 2013. Meanwhile, at the time, Bitcoin traded for $1,206. With the pioneering crypto asset now changing hands at $98,070, it is up 8,031% since December 2013.This confirms DOGE has outperformed BTC within the same timeframe. Citing this shocking reality, Pal argued that Dogecoin , despite its inflationary model and meme coin nature, is harder money than Bitcoin.

He criticized the Department of Justice (DOJ) for failing to address allegations involving over $100 million allegedly linked to election interference. Winklevoss called on the incoming US Attorney General to take action and resolve these issues. In a post on X dated November 23, Winklevoss highlighted his concerns over the DOJ's decision under Attorney General Merrick Garland. He claimed that the DOJ avoided pursuing the charges because they were not part of Bankman-Fried’s extradition agreement with the Bahamian government. He questioned why legal formalities prevented action on such serious accusations involving stolen customer funds. Federal prosecutors initially dropped the charges last year, citing objections from Bahamian authorities. The accusations alleged that more than $100 million was diverted from Alameda Research to make over 300 political donations. According to the indictment, these contributions were often made using corporate funds or through intermediaries to conceal their origins. The goal, prosecutors said, was to gain influence in Washington, D.C., and push legislation favorable to FTX and the broader cryptocurrency industry. Bankman-Fried was one of the top political donors during the 2022 midterm elections. Winklevoss emphasized the need to investigate how these funds were used and why the DOJ chose not to pursue the allegations, especially given their potential impact on election outcomes. He criticized the DOJ’s handling of the case, arguing that campaign finance violations should not have been overlooked. Meanwhile, other figures involved in the FTX collapse have faced legal consequences. Caroline Ellison and Ryan Salame received sentences of two years and 7.5 years, respectively, while Gary Wang and Nishad Singh avoided prison time by cooperating with prosecutors. Bankman-Fried himself is currently serving a 25-year sentence for fraud and related crimes. In a parallel development, FTX’s bankruptcy managers are moving forward with a reorganization strategy set to begin in January.

36817537,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654767,1732521936,Is This The ‘Next Dogecoin’? Top Crypto Analyst Thinks So,"In a new analysis, prominent crypto analyst Miles Deutscher unveiled his thesis on a crypto he believes could rival Dogecoin in this market cycle. With a following of over 550,000 on X and 208,000 YouTube subscribers, Deutscher’s insights carry significant weight in the crypto community. Titled “I Just Found The Next DOGE! [10X Potential… Or More?],” Deutscher’s video explores the untapped potential of Luckycoin (LKY)—a meme coin that not only predates Dogecoin but was instrumental in its creation. “Dogecoin was originally a fork of a cryptocurrency called Luckycoin, itself a fork of Litecoin,” Deutscher highlighted, referencing Dogecoin’s official website. This connection places Luckycoin at the very foundation of Dogecoin’s existence. Is Luckycoin The ‘Next Dogecoin’? To substantiate his claim, Deutscher cited a podcast featuring Jackson Palmer, co-creator of Dogecoin. Palmer stated: “You know, you were asking me before the show, like, why was there a decision to fork Luckycoin, which was itself a fork of Litecoin, which itself is a fork of Bitcoin… And that’s because Luckycoin had this whole notion of random block rewards built in.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Extends Rally – Can This Lead To A Breakout Above $0.82? Deutscher further pointed out that Dogecoin’s source code contains lines nearly identical to Luckycoin’s, with the primary difference being the replacement of “Luckycoin” with “Dogecoin.” Luckycoin, launched in May 2013, saw its network halt in November 2013. The last original block, numbered 81,743, was mined on November 26, 2013. The reasons for its dormancy included the disappearance of its founder and the unsustainable nature of its random block rewards, which deterred miners. However, on August 25, 2024, the network was revived starting from block 81,744. This community-led takeover has reignited interest in Luckycoin, making it one of the oldest actively mined chains in existence. “This makes it the longest-running meme coin blockchain ever. What’s the next oldest running meme coin blockchain? Well, it’s Doge, and Luckycoin is actually older than Doge,” Deutscher emphasized. The revival has led to a dramatic increase in Luckycoin’s hash rate. At one point, it surpassed Litecoin and Dogecoin. “When you see a spike like this in the interest for mining a coin, there’s two reasons for it: One, when price increases, this creates a flywheel of more people mining because they see that there’s profitability there. Two, exchanges who actually want to list a coin that may not have the necessary supply The only way for them to acquire enough Lucky to list is actually to mine the coin themselves,” Deutscher explained. Notably, industry insider Crypto Dog hinted at major exchanges mining Luckycoin: “Not naming names, but I know one tier-one exchange is currently accumulating Lucky through LTC merge mining.” Deutscher addressed the discrepancies in Luckycoin’s market capitalization reported on platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which list it around $100 million. He argued that these figures are misleading due to lost or dormant coins from the early mining days. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Rapid Dogecoin Surge To $1: The Timing May Surprise You By accounting for approximately 8 million Luckycoins that are likely lost or inaccessible, Deutscher calculated the true active supply to be around 6.2 million Luckycoins. At the current price of $9, this places Luckycoin’s market cap at approximately $56 million. Comparing this to Dogecoin’s $64 billion market cap, Deutscher highlighted the potential for growth: “Luckycoin is a 1,141x away from Doge, which is a massive discrepancy and, I think, a really powerful shelling point for retail because this is the OG Doge.” Deutscher presented a series of scenarios illustrating Luckycoin’s potential: 5x Increase: Market cap reaches $282 million, representing 0.44% of Dogecoin’s market cap. 10x Increase: Achieves 1% of Dogecoin’s market cap at $600 million. 20x Increase: Reaches 1.75% of Dogecoin’s market cap at $1.1 billion. Emphasizing the importance of storytelling in crypto, Deutscher stated: “Crypto is driven by narratives; crypto is driven by stories. I personally haven’t found a story this compelling in crypto in a long time.” He believes that Luckycoin’s rich history and direct connection to Dogecoin provide a compelling narrative that could resonate with both retail investors and the broader crypto community. Looking ahead, Deutscher identified the upcoming Chinese New Year on January 29th as a potential catalyst. In Chinese culture, luck and prosperity are highly valued, and Luckycoin’s branding aligns seamlessly with these themes. “Chinese culture is all about luck, prosperity, wealth, and health. Luckycoin is literally the epitome of this […] If China picks up this narrative, the stars are basically aligning for this coin to perform really, really well,” he suggested. Currently, Luckycoin is not widely available on major exchanges, which Deutscher views as both a challenge and an opportunity. “It’s not on a Bybit, an OKX, a Binance, a Coinbase… It’s only just been listed on MEXC. Because it’s not on big exchanges, liquidity is thin […] Once it becomes accessible […] that could potentially lead to the floodgates opening on retail coming in and actually buying this coin,” he noted. Beyond his own advocacy, Deutscher highlighted that other influential figures are beginning to discuss Luckycoin. Notably, Ansem, known for his influence on Solana-based projects, has acknowledged Luckycoin as the “OG Doge.” “The important thing here is the fact that he knows about it and he’s talking about it […] I think this will only continue to gain traction, not only because it’s got the OG Doge narrative in a cycle where Doge is performing so well but also because it has that Chinese New Year narrative as well,” Deutscher predicted. Deutscher disclosed his own investment in Luckycoin, having accumulated it between $2.20 and $3.20. He emphasized transparency, stating: “I’m not paid to do this video. I’m not paid because there is no team. I wasn’t given a discounted OTC. I put my own money in; I backed this myself.

With strong price performance and rising institutional interest, Bitcoin ETFs are rapidly becoming major players in the cryptocurrency market, nearing the title of the largest Bitcoin holders globally. At the same time, these funds are closing in on gold ETFs in terms of assets under management (AUM). Since their launch in January, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed substantial growth. According to crypto analyst HODL15Capital, they currently hold approximately 1.081 million BTC , just shy of Nakamoto's estimated stash. Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s anonymous creator, is believed to hold about 5.68% of the total Bitcoin supply, worth over $100 billion. If the current growth trend continues, analysts predict ETFs could surpass Nakamoto’s holdings by Thanksgiving . Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the rapid pace of inflows into these ETFs. He stated that they are now 98% of the way to surpassing Nakamoto’s Bitcoin holdings. “At this rate, the milestone could be reached within days if inflows remain consistent,” Balchunas noted. Over the past week, these ETFs experienced a significant surge in inflows, with a 97% week-on-week increase to $3.3 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust alone accounted for $2 billion of these inflows. Many attribute this spike to the introduction of options trading for these ETFs, which is drawing more institutional investors into the space. This growing interest reflects a shift in mainstream adoption of Bitcoin as a key investment asset . In addition to surpassing Nakamoto, Bitcoin ETFs are steadily catching up to gold ETFs in AUM. Currently, gold ETFs manage $120 billion, while Bitcoin ETFs are not far behind at $107 billion. Analysts believe that Bitcoin ETFs could overtake gold ETFs by Christmas, marking another major milestone in the crypto industry. Bitcoin’s exceptional performance this year has played a pivotal role in this growth. The cryptocurrency has surged nearly 160% since January, trading close to $100,000 and reaching a market capitalization of $1.91 trillion. This makes Bitcoin more valuable than silver and even larger than companies like Saudi Aramco. However, Bitcoin still trails behind gold, which boasts a market capitalization exceeding $18 trillion. These developments underline Bitcoin’s growing appeal among institutional investors and its increasing role as a competitor to traditional assets like gold. As Bitcoin ETFs continue to gain traction, their impact on the broader financial landscape is becoming undeniable.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitcoin-etfs-set-to-surpass-satoshi-s-holdings-by-year-end,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36817467.jpeg

In a post on November 24, Saylor hinted at potential moves, fueling interest among crypto enthusiasts. MicroStrategy remains the largest public Bitcoin holder, with 331,200 BTC in its treasury. The company’s Bitcoin-focused strategy has delivered significant returns, with a year-to-date yield of 41.8%. This impressive performance has also boosted MicroStrategy’s stock, with its shares rising more than 515% this year, making it a standout in U.S. markets. The $3 billion was raised on November 22 through convertible debt, which allows institutional investors to buy notes with a premium linked to MicroStrategy’s stock. These notes mature in 2029, providing long-term funding for the company’s Bitcoin initiatives. This fresh capital aligns with MicroStrategy’s ambitious plan to raise $42 billion over three years , a strategy dubbed “21/21,” combining equity and fixed-income methods to fuel growth. Saylor’s comment that the company’s portfolio tracker, SaylorTracker, “needs more green dots,” has further fueled expectations of another Bitcoin purchase. These green dots represent acquisitions, and Saylor’s previous hints have often preceded large-scale buys. In earlier moves, MicroStrategy added about 80,000 BTC to its holdings, solidifying its reputation as a Bitcoin powerhouse. This approach has also allowed MicroStrategy to generate returns without engaging in mining, saving operational costs while reaping the benefits of Bitcoin price movements. The company uses tools like ATM offerings to manage risks and enhance returns for shareholders. Saylor highlighted that these methods help strip Bitcoin’s volatility and transfer performance gains to MicroStrategy’s equity holders. MicroStrategy’s unique focus on Bitcoin has set it apart in the financial world. By leveraging financial instruments and strategic planning, the company has become a leader in the Bitcoin ecosystem, reinforcing its commitment to maximizing shareholder value through its cryptocurrency holdings.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/microstrategy-hints-at-new-bitcoin-move-after-3b-raise,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36817269.jpeg

36817762,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102658,1732520207,"Expert Says XRP Reaching $100 is Very Possible, Ditches Market Cap Concerns","Armando Pantoja, an angel investor active in crypto since 2011, recently challenged the prevailing skepticism around the potential for XRP to hit $100. Pantoja took to social media to address critics who argue that XRP's market cap would make such a price unattainable. He drew a compelling analogy between the future potential of XRP and the early days of the internet.He argued that dismissing the possibility of XRP reaching $100 based on market cap is akin to the arguments in the 1990s that the internet couldn't become a dominant force simply because only a fraction of homes owned personal computers. “People adopt, things change, and the world adapts,” Pantoja wrote , urging crypto investors and enthusiasts to think beyond the present constraints of the market. He emphasized that the path to mass adoption, whether for cryptocurrency or new technologies, often unfolds in unexpected ways. A testament to this is the explosive growth of the internet over the past few decades.The comments come as XRP continues to pull stellar performance in the ongoing bull market, prompting many to issue bold targets while others call for caution. XRP Must Rally 6,750% to Reach $100XRP is worth $1.46 today after seeing its value explode by 185% in the past three weeks. It even traded at $1.6216 over the weekend, marking its first time reaching that price in three years.However, attaining $100 requires XRP’s value to expand by 68-fold or 6,750% from its current level. Moreover, at a $100 price, XRP would command a market cap of $5.7 trillion and a fully diluted cap of about $10 trillion.Some ambitious analysts have suggested that XRP could surpass this threshold even this season. However, critics have challenged the ambition, citing that a trillion-dollar cap for XRP is far from feasible for XRP at this time.Drawing Parallels with Bitcoin's RiseXRP proponents often remind critics that similar doubts were voiced about Bitcoin in its early years—such as claims that Bitcoin could never reach $10,000. Notably, Bitcoin traded as low as $0.04865 back in July 2010, just 14 years ago. Today, even the $100K price point for Bitcoin is within reach, as it currently trades around $98K with a market cap of $1.95 trillion. Essentially, XRP enthusiasts draw inspiration from Bitcoin’s rise, believing that a $100 price and beyond could be feasible for XRP someday in the future.While community commentators like Pantoja are deeply optimistic about XRP reaching $100, he has stated that this threshold could remain elusive for at least another five years—unlike others who argue it’s attainable by 2025. “Tech takes time,” he said, adding that he expects XRP’s peak for this bull season to be around $8 to $20.

Not Happening, Claims Millionaire Analyst Stellar’s market capitalization has reached $17.3 billion, surpassing Shiba Inu and approaching the top 10 cryptocurrencies, following an impressive 480% increase in the last month. Many people are wondering if XLM can keep up this impressive performance or if it is about to take a turn for the worse. The path of the token is definitely interesting, even though experts seem to have different opinions. #XLM price has increased by over 480% in the past 30 days and more than 180% in the past 7 days. Currently, #Stellar is trading at $0.566, meaning it is only a few steps away from reaching its previous all-time high. pic.twitter.com/SrdPgDAoio — Cryptowizard101 (@realwizard101) November 24, 2024 Stellar: Riding A Wave Of Optimism The significant buying interest and expanding investor confidence that drove XLM’s price increase from $0.302 to a peak of $0.6342 are indicative of a robust bullish push. Stellar’s founder, Jed McCaleb, heightened the anticipation by referring to the initiative as “the most underrated and least understood crypto.” A lot of new people looking at Stellar so I thought I’d write down some quick thoughts about why Stellar is worth your time. IMHO Stellar is the most underrated and least understood crypto project. A lot of recent attention but people are still sleeping on this network. Stellar… — Jed McCaleb (@JedMcCaleb) November 23, 2024 His audacious statement is consistent with the increasing sentiment that Stellar’s potential is finally being acknowledged. Historical tendencies support optimism. XLM’s recent rise resembles its November 2017 and 2021 explosions, suggesting a cyclical trend. Analysts say the token is about to break out of a long-term descending triangle pattern, which might lead to a bullish phase if resistance levels are broken. Overbought? In spite of the current surge in interest, technical signs point to caution. The Relative Strength Index for XLM has risen to 92, much above the 70 threshold for an overbought level. This frequently acts as a precursor to a potential price adjustment. Similarly, the price of XLM has broken beyond the upper limit of its Bollinger Bands, a measure of volatility. This suggests that the asset may have been overextended. Related Reading: Chainlink Rockets 20%: Whale Activity Sparks Break From Bear Trend The Road Ahead For XLM Though there is always chance of short-term challenges, XLM’s long-term future seems bright. In the next three months analysts predict an 81% rise; in the next six months a 48% rise; then in the next year a 41% rise. These figures clearly show the great faith in Stellar’s foundations and the optimistic momentum of the larger market. The primary concern is whether Stellar can maintain its growth and reclaim its all-time high as it approaches critical resistance levels. Although caution is necessary, the current rally emphasizes the growing interest in Stellar’s ecosystem, rendering XLM a token that should be closely monitored in the months ahead.

36815055,178187,1732515495,Bitget Wallet Launches Cutting-Edge Toolkit for Memecoin Trading Across Multiple Blockchains,"Victoria, Seychelles, November 25th, 2024, Chainwire Bitget Wallet , a leading Web3 non-custodial wallet, has unveiled a comprehensive memecoin trading toolkit designed to empower traders navigating the fast-paced and unpredictable memecoin market. The toolkit equips users to discover high-potential tokens, analyze critical data, and execute trades effectively across multiple chains. Memecoins have seen explosive growth recently, with ecosystems like Solana and Base leading bridged net flows in USD over the past three months. Thriving memecoin communities and projects have further fueled trader interest. With thousands of new memecoins entering the market daily, Bitget Wallet's toolkit simplifies the trading process, helping users identify early-stage tokens and high-performing projects. Notable tokens identified by Hot Picks include PNUT, which surged 2,424,652%, BAN with 28,641%, GOAT with 35,881%, ACT with 6,270%, and CHILLGUY with 11,605.58% as of November 21, showcasing substantial return potential. Innovative Features for Memecoin Trading Bitget Wallet offers early access to unlisted tokens, a wide range of trading options across multiple chains, and robust security through its non-custodial design. Its innovative tools, including MemeX, Hot Picks, and professional-grade analytics, empower users to discover and evaluate memecoins confidently. Features like cross-chain trading, instant swaps, and on-chain insights make Bitget Wallet a reliable choice for navigating the fast-paced memecoin market. How to Trade Memecoins with Bitget Wallet Step 1: Set Up Download the Bitget Wallet app from app stores or access it through a web browser. Create a wallet by setting a strong password and securely noting your recovery phrase. Next, deposit funds into the wallet. If you lack cryptocurrency, use Bitget Wallet's OTC service to buy Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), or Solana (SOL) with fiat currency. Navigate to the ""Buy Crypto"" section, select your preferred fiat and cryptocurrency, specify the amount, and complete the transaction. The funds will appear in your wallet once processed. Step 2: Discover Promising Tokens Leverage Bitget Wallet's MemeX and Hot Picks tools to uncover promising memecoins. MemeX identifies early-stage tokens with market caps under $1 million. Real-time updates and filters for parameters like creation date, liquidity, and trading volume help users spot high-growth potential coins before they trend. Hot Picks highlights trending memecoins with market caps under $10 million, based on blockchain data, social media buzz, and smart money movements. These tools enable a diversified strategy across different growth stages. Step 3: Analyze and Select Bitget Wallet's analytics tools are designed to help users make informed decisions about their memecoin investments. The K-Line chart offers real-time visualizations of price trends, complete with intuitive buy/sell markers, allowing users to easily identify patterns such as bullish breakouts or downward corrections. Meanwhile, the on-chain data dashboard provides comprehensive insights, including market caps, trading volume, liquidity flows, and wallet activity. Step 4: Execute Trades with Precision To navigate the volatile memecoin market, rely on key on-chain metrics for informed decisions. When buying, focus on trading volume spikes, low liquidity with growing demand, and increasing wallet activity or new entries—signaling rising interest and growth potential. For selling, watch for sharp price increases without liquidity growth, declining wallet activity, or reduced trading volume, which may indicate fading momentum or pump-and-dump risks. Bitget Wallet simplifies this with its Swap feature and on-chain data insights, providing the speed and liquidity crucial for fast-moving markets. Instant Swap mode enables quick transactions, while cross-chain compatibility ensures seamless trading across networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Base. Its gas fee borrowing feature prevents interruptions, maximizing efficiency and optimizing profits. Memecoin Supercycle Alvin Kan, COO of Bitget Wallet, emphasized the role of memecoins in the current crypto cycle: ""Memecoins are shaping up to be a defining trend of this bull run. With thriving communities and growing adoption, ecosystems like Solana are emerging as the new hub for memecoins. Bitget Wallet's tools are designed to help traders capitalize on these opportunities, equipping them to stay ahead in this fast-evolving landscape."" About Bitget Wallet Bitget Wallet is the home of Web3, uniting endless possibilities in one non-custodial wallet.

The web3 firm’s co-founder and CEO Trung Nguyen said on X on Saturday that the layoffs were not related to the company’s budget or financial health.  “Instead, it is a strategic move that allows for a sharper focus and positioning Sky Mavis for hypergrowth in 2025 and beyond,” he said.  According to Nguyen, the move came despite the year being “one of valuable growth and evolution”. Going forward the company will focus on its core products rather than trying to build products for all users, he said. The web3 creator will concentrate on its Ronin Wallet and Waypoint, Mavis Marketplace, Axie Infinity, Web3 game publishing, and expanding the Ronin Network for more builders. It is also working on a new Axie game.  In 2023, co-founder Aleksander Larsen said in an interview with Finoverse that the company had 250 employees at its main base in Singapore and across its subsidiaries in Vietnam, the U.S. and Norway.

36815967,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102641,1732514678,"As XRP Falls, Expert Predicts Most likely Scenario for XRP","Amid the current XRP pullback, a market expert recently predicted a further drop to a major support level before a rebound to 2021 highs. XRP is one of the victims of the ongoing market-wide pullback, dropping by over 1% in the last 24 hours. Interestingly, at the start of the current retracement, market analyst MichaelXBT predicted a further price slump before an eventual rebound to new heights.XRP to Face Further DropIn an analysis yesterday, the market commentator called attention to an ascending channel on the 4-hour XRP chart, which has prevailed since mid-November. Such a channel, which features higher highs and higher lows, confirms that bulls are in complete control of the market.However, data from the chart shows that XRP retested the upper trendline of the channel when it spiked to a peak of $1.63 on Nov. 23. This top presented resistance that coincided with the latest retracement in the broader market. XRP 4H Chart | MichaelXBT As a result, XRP price slumped, initially dropping to the $1.41 region . While at this level, MichaelXBT predicted a steeper decline, which he noted could push XRP to retest the lower trendline of the ascending channel. Such a retest could grant bulls the necessary strength to engineer a decisive rebound.Interestingly, this price drop materialized, with XRP collapsing by nearly 11% across two 4-hour candlesticks to a low of $1.2795 yesterday. Notably, this price level aligned with the lower trendline of the ascending channel.A Possible Rebound to 2021 HighsFollowing the retest, XRP has now embarked on a recovery campaign , as MichaelXBT envisioned. At the time of reporting, the altcoin has increased by more than 14% from the $1.2795 low. MichaelXBT shared an update to the analysis, confirming that prices are moving according to plan.https://twitter.com/MichaelXBT/status/1860808816494878922If XRP continues to follow the trajectory laid out by the market watcher, its price will likely breach the previous $1.63 resistance level. According to MichaelXBT, XRP’s recovery could allow it to retest again the upper boundary of the channel, which now sits at around $1.7.Notably, a breach of the upper boundary would give bulls enough strength to knock at the 2021 top of $1.96. This level served as a major resistance zone for XRP during the 2021 bull run. Market veteran Peter Brandt believes XRP price could explode if it breaks above this level.On the daily chart, the next major Fibonacci resistance stands at 1.618 ($2.34), surpassing the 2021 peak. However, as XRP currently trades for $1.47, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 86. While this confirms robust market strength, it also suggests an overbought condition, which warrants caution.

BTC dropped more than 3.5% from its peak, with a technical and sentimental pullback on the back of profit-taking, which was widely expected as the token neared the $100K mark.   XRP and dogecoin (DOGE) fell more than 5% to lead losses among majors. Solana’s SOL, ether (ETH), Cardano’s ADA and BNB fell between 2%-5%, before recovering during early Asian hours Monday. Overall market capitalization fell 2.4%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a broad-based liquid index tracking top tokens, is down 1.48% in the past 24 hours.   Markets largely recovered during the early Asian hours Monday, bringing down 24-hour losses to under 2% for all major tokens.   However, crypto-tracked futures took a beating with over $500 million in liquidations on both longs and shorts amid the volatility. Over $366 million in longs, or bullish bets, and $127 million in shorts, or bearish bets, were evaporated, Coinglass data shows.   Small altcoins and futures tracking midcaps recorded over $100 million in liquidations, higher than bitcoin or ether, in an unusual move — indicative of higher risk taking among traders.   However, traders don’t consider the pullback concerning.   “It's clear that Bitcoin has been leading the market, a key indicator that much of the demand is driven by institutions buying ETFs. Hitting the $100k mark is very likely in the coming week,” Jeff Mei, COO at crypto exchange BTSE, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message Monday. “We also believe that institutions will start buying into the Ethereum ETFs soon and, hopefully, the Solana ones once they're approved.”    “With the stock market making steady gains and the Trump transition team meeting with a number of crypto executives to discuss pro-crypto policies, it looks promising that this rally will continue into 2025,” Mei added.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE | XRP,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/25/xrp-doge-lead-crypto-losses-as-weekend-bitcoin-pullback-causes-500-m-liquidations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72a7161a48deba3ee4807ba5bea1c8dcdf45494e-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As bitcoin (BTC) nears the $100,000 milestone – a clear sign of strength – the reality is that its actually quite vulnerable to potential negative news.  That's according to the ""order book skew ratio,"" which shows that buyers have surprisingly pulled back their firepower as prices near six digits. The ratio measures the number of people wanting to sell, or the ask side, relative to those on the buy or the bid side.  The three-day moving average of the 1% skew, which measures the ask-bid imbalance within 1% of the mid-price, is now elevated, approaching levels seen only three times since 2022, according to data tracked by cryptocurrency prime broker FalconX.  Its a sign that the bullish momentum that brought prices to near $100,000 from $68,000 since the U.S. election early this month is not being replenished by new buying interest, leaving sellers in a more dominant position. As such, a slightest of negative news could lead to a notable price correction.  ""As we near $100K, the skew approaches levels seen only three times since 2022. While this doesn't threaten the medium-term rally, it suggests that the struggle to break above the $100K level could be intense,"" FalconX said in the newsletter.  Bitcoin's uptrend stalled slightly over the weekend, since it peaked at $99,500 on Friday. Over the past three days, the cryptocurrency's dominance rate—its share of the total crypto market capitalization—has dropped sharply from 59% from 61.5%. The decline indicates a rotation of funds out of bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies, supporting the case for price correction.  In any case, a potential correction or eventual breakout above $100,000 could be violent one as the overall market depth or liquidity has declined amid the price rally despite an increase in trading volumes, according to FalconX.  Liquidity refers to the market's ability to absorb large trading orders at stable prices. The recent drop in liquidity means few large orders can have an outsized impact on the going market, potentially engineering rapid price swings.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/coindesk-news/2024/11/25/bitcoins-order-book-skews-makes-it-more-vulnerable-to-negative-news-as-btc-price-approaches-100-k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc303e7cebe2a4a343364544d04682018ce96f61-1280x749.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The seasoned analyst shared this sentiment in a post on X, highlighting his price targets for various altcoins. He made the announcement as Bitcoin first broke into the $99K price level, showing readiness for the long-awaited $100K milestone.Time for Dogecoin to Pump to $3According to Crypto Scofield, the altcoin market is now ready to follow Bitcoin's lead and push into all-time-high price ranges. Among the highlighted tokens was Dogecoin, which the analyst suggests could peak at $3.Notably, Dogecoin is currently priced at $0.4775 as of today, a level not seen since 2021. When Crypto Scofield first made his call for Dogecoin to pump, DOGE was trading at around $0.3700. Essentially, the asset has already surged by approximately 30% in less than two days since the call.The analysis projecting further upside suggests that market participants who join the Dogecoin rally today could see significant returns from the projected price surge. For context, if Dogecoin were to reach $3 from its current price of $0.4700, it would represent a massive 710% price increase for those buying now.Views of Other Analysts on Dogecoin Reaching $3Crypto Scofield is not the only one projecting that Dogecoin could reach $3. Two weeks ago, Ash Crypto, an analyst with 1.3 million followers on X, also suggested that Dogecoin could hit $3 within the next six to twelve months. Technical analyst Crypto Yapper has also voiced similar sentiments regarding Dogecoin's potential.Ambitious DOGE Outlooks Beyond $3On the more ambitious side, analysts like Javon Marks and Ali Martinez have issued even bolder targets for Dogecoin. Marks, for example, cited historical patterns to argue for a monumental 21,700% rise in Dogecoin’s value.Meanwhile, Martinez has also looked at historical trends and proposed a 7,900% growth to $23. In a separate analysis, he used other indicators to suggest a $18 price point.However, these ambitious estimates rely heavily on historical patterns repeating, and critics have dismissed them as highly speculative, citing concerns over market cap implications.",POSITIVE,DOGE,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/25/expert-says-its-time-for-dogecoin-to-pump-to-3/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-says-its-time-for-dogecoin-to-pump-to-3,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

After concluding the prior week in a phase of consolidation, the meme cryptocurrency carried this trend into the early days of the new week. However, the Dogecoin price kicked off a new 25% rally on Friday, November 22, to create a new 2024 high. Related Reading: Top Analyst Claims XRP New ATH Is Just Around The Corner – Details Interestingly, this new rally saw the Dogecoin price break a bull flag to the upside. Such a rally has brought into focus the perspective of the Dogecoin price reaching a new all-time high before the end of the year. Dogecoin Price Rally Teases Breakout To $0.82 King of meme coins Dogecoin surged by about 25% as the week drew to a close, reaching an intraday high of $0.4759 on Saturday. This rally is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests that the Dogecoin price has finally resumed another leg up after a brief consolidation since it hit $0.43 earlier on November 14. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the significance of this rally in a post on X, drawing attention to Dogecoin’s decisive breakout above a bull flag pattern. According to Martinez, this technical breakout could set the stage for a much larger rally, with his projection targeting a bullish move toward $0.82. If achieved, this price level would represent an impressive increase of approximately 90% from the current Dogecoin price. #Dogecoin $DOGE is in the middle of a bullish breakout to $0.82! https://t.co/KjLJQ7ZkNm pic.twitter.com/Rib4XImoTT — Ali (@ali_charts) November 23, 2024 How Feasible Is The Dogecoin Rally To $0.82? Before the Dogecoin price can rally to the $0.82 price level, it would first need to surpass its long-standing all-time high of $0.7316, a milestone that has remained unbroken for over three years. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.4287, reflecting a slight pullback from its recent intraday peak of $0.4759. This retreat shows that the consolidation phase is not yet complete, as resistance appears to have formed near the $0.43 level and has created a sell wall that must be overcome. Breaking toward the all-time high would first require Dogecoin to achieve a decisive and sustained breach above the $0.43 threshold, which remains a critical level for regaining upward momentum. Interestingly, recent whale activity points to a potential upswing for the meme coin in in the coming week. On-chain data reveals that large holders, or “whales,” have been actively accumulating, purchasing over 550 million DOGE tokens worth an estimated $214.5 million. Related Reading: Chainlink Rockets 20%: Whale Activity Sparks Break From Bear Trend These whale addresses, which typically hold between 10 million and 100 million DOGE, are often seen as influential in shaping market trends.

While the milestone signals remarkable strength, the price has yet to claim this key level, leaving investors in suspense. Market demand remains robust, fueling optimism that Bitcoin will soon break above the $100,000 threshold. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Buying Spree – Taker Buy Volume hits $1.683B In One Hour Key data from CryptoQuant reveals that Bitcoin’s Realized Profit has reached an all-time high of $443 million in daily gains. This highlights significant buying pressure in the market as traders and long-term holders lock in unprecedented profits. However, this record-breaking profit-taking is also sparking concerns among some investors. They fear the rally could stall, interpreting the surge in realized profits as a potential signal of a local top scenario. Despite these mixed signals, the overall market sentiment leans bullish. Bitcoin continues to hold above crucial support levels, suggesting that demand remains strong enough to drive the next leg up. With the cryptocurrency just shy of a monumental breakthrough, the coming hours and days will be critical in determining whether Bitcoin’s momentum can sustain a decisive move beyond $100,000 or if a temporary consolidation is on the horizon. Bitcoin Rally Could Continue Above $100K Bitcoin’s rally from $66,800 to $99,800 has marked a unique and unexpected bullish phase in 2024. As prices approach the elusive $100,000 milestone, many investors who doubted Bitcoin’s potential to hit this level this year are now revising their expectations. The surge has been driven by strong demand and market confidence, making a breakout above $100,000 seem inevitable. Should this occur, analysts widely anticipate a bullish continuation for Bitcoin, further solidifying its dominance in the crypto space. Related Reading: Avalanche Soars 20% In 24 Hours – Analyst Reveals Next Price Target However, market dynamics suggest the journey to $100,000 may not be without hurdles. Corrections during this phase are not only possible but could also be beneficial for market health. A pullback would provide an opportunity for consolidation, potentially giving altcoins the space to recover and initiate their own rallies. Critical insights from CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn shed light on the aggressive nature of this rally. Data shows Bitcoin’s Realized Profit recently hit an all-time high of $443 million daily, reflecting significant profit-taking activity. While this confirms robust buying pressure, it also raises concerns among cautious investors who interpret the spike in profits as a potential sign of a local top. Despite these concerns, there’s room for growth in Bitcoin’s trajectory. Maintaining support above $95,000 would sustain bullish momentum, but a healthy correction from current levels might also provide the fuel needed for a stronger push beyond $100,000 in the near future. BTC Testing Crucial Supply Bitcoin is currently holding strong above the $97,000 mark, maintaining bullish momentum as it eyes a push above the $100,000 milestone. This level represents a significant psychological and technical barrier, and market sentiment remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential to break it. With demand staying robust, many investors are preparing for an explosive surge that could define Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming weeks. However, there are growing concerns about the possibility of Bitcoin setting a local top. If this scenario materializes, the price could enter a consolidation phase, potentially lasting several weeks as the market digests recent gains. Analysts suggest that holding above the $98,000 level in the next few days would keep bullish momentum intact and pave the way for a breakout above $100,000. Related Reading: Polkadot Holds Key Demand Level – DOT Could Hit $11 In Coming Weeks On the other hand, if Bitcoin fails to hold the $97,000 mark, it could signal the start of a healthy correction. In this case, the price may retrace to the $92,000 level, a key demand zone that would likely act as strong support.

This remarkable price movement has garnered the attention of many analysts as investors continue to project the trajectory of the price. Related Reading: Chainlink Rockets 20%: Whale Activity Sparks Break From Bear Trend There are basically two ways the XRP price can go from here: either a continued move upwards or a notable correction. An in-between is a consolidation pattern. CrediBULL Crypto shared his insights on the potential paths the altcoin might take next. Using the Elliott Wave Theory, he highlighted two scenarios that could shape XRP’s near-term future. What’s The Next Path For XRP Price? According to CrediBULL Crypto, XRP’s recent rally exhibits a textbook example of a five-wave impulsive move, complete with clearly identifiable subwaves. This pattern confirms that the cryptocurrency has likely reached its absolute bottom at the November low of $0.49, which is a strong foundation for its current upward trend. The impulsive wave structure suggests that the crypto is at a pivotal juncture, and its future trajectory hinges on whether it sustains specific price levels. The first possibility centers on XRP failing to maintain its position above $1.05, which is the origin of the fifth subwave in the current impulsive structure. Should this level break, it would confirm that the XRP price is in a larger Wave 2 correction. According to the Elliot Waves Theory, Waves 2 and 4 are corrective waves, while Waves 1, 3, and 5 are the main bullish waves. before This correction, while bearish in the short term, would lay the groundwork for an even stronger Wave 3 rally in the future. CrediBULL Crypto predicts a very different outcome if the XRP price manages to hold above the $1.05 level. Holding above the $1.05 level would indicate that the fifth subwave is extending. In this case, the analyst predicted that the XRP price will surpass the $2 mark before experiencing any substantial pullback. The Road Ahead For XRP XRP, which had lingered below the $1 threshold for the past three years, has now firmly established itself above this pivotal mark. The recent XRP price surge to $1.6 suggests that the cryptocurrency is in a stronger position to target the $2 milestone rather than retreat into a significant correction. This bullish sentiment is bolstered by speculation around SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s anticipated resignation in January 2025.
