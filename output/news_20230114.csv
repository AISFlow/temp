The complaint echoes those made by a bipartisan grouping of U.S. Senators and by the crypto exchange‚Äôs founder Sam Bankman-Fried, and expresses concern the firm might tread on the toes of future work by an independent examiner.  ‚ÄúS&C‚Äôs disclosures as filed are wholly insufficient to evaluate whether S&C satisfies the Bankruptcy Code‚Äôs conflict-free and disinterestedness standards,‚Äù said Trustee Andrew Vara, a Department of Justice official responsible for bankruptcy cases. ‚ÄúThe incomplete disclosures are a sufficient and independent reason to deny the application.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAny investigation led by S&C would be duplicative and wasteful of estate resources if the Court were to grant the U.S. Trustee‚Äôs pending motion to appoint an examiner with a comprehensive investigative mandate,‚Äù Vara added.  FTX‚Äôs General Counsel Ryne Miller previously worked at S&C for eight years, Vara noted, and the law firm might find itself in the ‚Äúconflicted position‚Äù of investigating both itself and its former staffer.

Solana(SOL) is one of these many altcoins, and it has kicked off the weekend with an explosive start. According to data by CoinGecko, SOL has gained 40% in the last 24 hours, sparking excitement across the entire Solana ecosystem. Although it remains unknown how long the altcoin can sustain such momentum, these significant price gains indicate an increasing positive sentiment from investors. Interestingly, as a result of its price rally, Solana (SOL) even surpassed Polygon (MATIC) in market cap, becoming the 10th biggest cryptocurrency. However, this was only for a short time, as the Ethereum-based token has since reclaimed its position. At the time of writing, SOL trades at a price of $23.75 with a 24-hour trading volume of $2,499,092,493 based on data from CoinGecko. That said, the token‚Äôs market cap is set at $8,820,357,518, with a circulating supply of 370,622,211. SOL trading at $22.42 | Source: SOLUSD Chart on Tradingview.com Related Reading: This Crypto Influencer Predicts Bitcoin Price At $25,000-$30,000 Soon Solana Has Been In The News Lately Prior to today‚Äôs development, Solana has been one of the altcoins in the headlines mainly due to its impressive price action. On Dec. 30, 2022, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted a statement expressing support for Solana after the token‚Äôs value plummeted as much as 20% at the end of last year due to the FTX crisis. In the next 24 hours following Buterin‚Äôs tweet, SOL‚Äôs price surged by 12% from around $8.19 to $9.50. At the start of the second week of 2023, SOL was trading at a value of $17.1, representing a price increase of about 80.63% in just over a week. Since then, SOL has been moving sideways till its price surge today. Asides from the tweet from Buterin, another propelling force behind Solana‚Äôs price actions were the massive price movements of the Solana-based meme coin BONK. Early this year, BONK, a new meme coin launched on December 25, gained over 2000% in the first week of the year, becoming the biggest meme coin in the Solana ecosystem. Although BONK soon crashed 50% following its tremendous bullish run, there is still much optimism surrounding the meme coin as many investors expect it could return to the previous high price levels in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Polkadot Shows No Sign Of Slowing, As DOT Gains 33% In Last 7 Days Price Prediction For Solana In 2023 According to top price prediction site, Wallet Investor, the price of SOL could fall as low as $5.875 in 2024, indicating a plausible 73.836% decrease from the current market price. However, Coincodex is predicting an overall bull market for Solana this year. The team expects SOL to trade at a value of $67.64 by 2024 if the altcoin follows the growth trajectory of the internet over the next 12 months. Regardless of the price predictions, Solana has started the year strong and appears to be one of the most promising projects for 2023.

7539278,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516069,1673694703,"This Crypto Influencer Predicts Bitcoin Price At $25,000-$30,000 Soon","The start of 2023 is bringing a different phase in the crypto market. Over the past few days, most crypto assets have regained value. The bullish trend has spiked a new sentiment in the market as several positive predictions have emerged. Ben Armstrong, a popular YouTuber known as BitBoy, predicted a bullish trend for Bitcoin in a few weeks. Armstrong, the author of a new book ‚ÄúCatching Up To Crypto‚Äù took to Twitter to express his views on BTC‚Äôs future price surge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze: $93 Million Shorts Liquidated In One Hour Bitcoin Price Rally Triggers Bullish Sentiment According to Armstrong, the primary crypto asset has triggered a bullish sentiment in the crypto community with its recent uptrend. Finally, BTC broke the barrier and climbed to the $18,000 level. As of January 12, the leading token reached $19K during trading hours. A review of the price history indicated that BTC reached the $15K region in November 2022. Notably, Bitcoin started alternating between $16,000 and $17,000 in December 2022. But this 2023, the primary crypto asset is showing impressive price movement. According to BitBoy‚Äôs post on Twitter, Bitcoin will gradually reach $25,000 or $30,000 this year. He forecasted that BTC would attain this new price rally within the next 10 to 15 weeks. Also, several people are becoming bullish in their trades with Bitcoin. On January 11, Armstrong posted about his belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs price explosion in 2023. However, the controversial YouTuber noted that the primary cryptocurrency might not hit a new all-time high (ATH) this year. On January 12, Bitcoin slightly hit the $19,000 level before retracting to the $18K level. BTC‚Äôs new price rally is likely due to the risk-on sentiments associated with other markets. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is hovering around $20,627. This shows that the token increased by 3.50% within 24 hours. Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap is about $366.43 billion having a surge of 4.62% in the past day. Also, its dominance over altcoins is 40.26%. Recall that in December 2022, Armstrong gave a forecast for Bitcoin. According to BitBoy‚Äôs tweet, the end of 2023 will see BTC reaching the $30,000 level. Also, he predicted the token would finally hit a new all-time high (ATH) by the end of 2024, while a new cycle of bearish trend would break out in 2025. But now, analysts believe BTC will reach the price mark in a few weeks. Crypto Whales Resume Transactions In Bitcoin With the recent BTC price rally, some crypto whales have resumed massive transactions in BTC. Some of the on-chain data providers have recorded huge BTC transactions recently. According to WhaleAlert, an unknown whale moved 5,545 BTC tokens to another anonymous wallet. The value of coins is worth over $104.3 million in the current market prices. On January 12, 4.000 BTC tokens worth $72.51 million were moved from an unknown wallet to the Huobi crypto exchange.

However, analysts have always released predictions for most crypto assets. While some projections turned out to be accurate, some still failed to happen as predicted. One analyst became popular for releasing an accurate prediction for Bitcoin‚Äôs 2018 bottom six months before the period. However, the pseudonymous analyst and trader, Smart Contracter, is suddenly bullish in his recent predictions. Analyst Scraps Bearish Stance On Bitcoin (BTC) Smart Contracter took to Twitter to inform his followers about his plan to scrap his bearish bias on the BTC/USD trading pair. His new decision was based on the recent Bitcoin price breaking out to a higher range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze: $93 Million Shorts Liquidated In One Hour Smart Contracter noted that Bitcoin could perform better than other cryptocurrencies in the future. He explained that the BTC‚Äôs price action is currently more impressive due to the impulsive disposition. The analyst disclosed that he desired to shift to long positions in his trades once the opportunity came through a breakdown. Further, Smart Contracter projected charts to explain the possible price trend for the leading crypto asset. For example, he predicted that Bitcoin would surge by more than $18,800. Also, he used Elliot Wave Theory to support his technical analysis for BTC. Smart Contracter reported that BTC would display a 5-wave pattern for its primary trend, but its corrective movement will follow a 3-wave way. Also, he predicted that Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance over the altcoins would hit 43%. now that #btc broke out of this slow choppy grind up, im scrapping bearish bias and looking to long pullbacks.

BTC lost its value as the pressure in the entire market kept increasing. With growing fear and uncertainty, the price of Bitcoin dropped to the $15K region in November 2022. But the trend is getting bullish as volatility is now on the increase. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $19,275, indicating an increase over the past 24 hours. Its market cap sits at $366.43 billion, signifying a growth of 4.62% in the past day. Also, BTC‚Äôs dominance over altcoins is 40.26%.
