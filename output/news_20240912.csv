WBTC is a token that allows investors to use bitcoin {{BTC}} on other blockchains, and plays a key role in lending DeFi as collateral, with a $9 billion market capitalization.  DeFi risk management firm BA Labs, an influential voice in the Sky protocol's governance, previously had proposed to reduce exposure to wBTC, due to perceived risks from Tron founder Justin Sun's involvement with the custodian for the underlying assets. Sky is one of the biggest DeFi projects and issuer of the $5 billion decentralized stablecoin DAI, so the development had been closely tracked by crypto analysts and blockchain industry watchers.  On Thursday, BA Labs proposed to gradually offboard all wBTC exposure from collateral assets in five steps, with the first one starting on Sep. 26. Each step will be voted on.  ""We find that legal due diligence would not provide an adequate level of assurance,"" BA Labs said in its proposal.  BA Labs recommended onboarding alternative products to the platform should the proposal pass.  Sun said in a statement: ""As the most important liquidity pool for the Defi ecosystem, WBTC has served the global user community successfully with a sterling track record that is unmatched by any competing offers recently floated by the skeptics. ""  Competitors energized  Currently, there are some $73 million worth of loans collateralized with wBTC on Sky-affiliated lending platform SparkLend, and some $127 million debt against wBTC in Sky's legacy vaults, according to the BA Labs post.  Tensions flared up around wBTC following crypto custody firm BitGo's announcement earlier this month that it planned to transition control of the asset to a joint operation with a custody platform called BiT Global.  The deal, which distributed control over the project's custody to three entities globally instead of just one, was cast as a way of helping to decentralize the operation.  According to an Aug. 9 press release, BiT Global is a global custody platform with regulated operations based in Hong Kong, registered as a Trust and Company Service Provider (TCSP), and is a ""a strategic partnership between BitGo, Justin Sun, and the Tron ecosystem.""  BitGo CEO Mike Belshe earlier this month defended the joint firm's autonomy from Sun and Tron.

Historical trends show Bitcoin drops significantly during market sell-offs but eventually rebounds, indicating holding through downturns could be wise if profits can't be taken. Current market fundamentals, including potential Fed rate cuts and global economic instability, signal a looming recession, which could trigger a massive Bitcoin sell-off. Despite its volatility, Bitcoin's underlying blockchain technology ensures its long-term presence, making it a viable investment for future buying opportunities. Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD) is a legendary millionaire maker. However, this cyber currency's road to glory is pockmarked with steep stomach-churning downturns. Those hapless investors who sold their Bitcoin holdings at a loss can easily wind up with deep regrets once it springs back. This analysis is not a diatribe against Bitcoin, far from it. But like any other equity, there is a time to invest, and there is a time to take your winnings and stand by for another buying opportunity. Timing the markets is tricky, but a flurry of red flags is flapping around Bitcoin and the rest of the global marketplace. Now might be an excellent time to take profits on this wildly volatile cyber currency and sit on the sidelines for a while. If you cannot take a profit on Bitcoin, holding it through a steep downturn could likely be the next best option. Since it arrived in the financial marketplace in 2009, Bitcoin has been soaring and crashing . But the overall momentum is in a decidedly upward direction as you can see from the historical charts below. In a nutshell, the fundamentals indicate investors should either bank their Bitcoin profits for now or ride out the coming storm. Either way, Bitcoin will most likely do what it always does when it springs back from a crash- soar past its most recent high. How Bitcoin Performed Over Past Two Market Sell-offs During the Covid Crash from February to March 2020, the Nasdaq dropped 30% over 33 days. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dropped 52% over 27 days. It also got a head start on the Nasdaq by roughly one week as you can see from the charts below. When the Fed announced its plans for a series of rate hikes in December 2021 , the Nasdaq dropped 37% from its most recent high in November of that year, before reversing course one year later. Over that same period, Bitcoin lost 76% of its value. Fig. 1 Yahoo.com Unfortunately, we only have those two market corrections to go by. Bitcoin wasn't around during the Great Recession of 2007-09, let alone the 2000 Dotcom Recession. But when responding to market turbulence it has demonstrated a high level of volatility since its inception. How Bitcoin Compares To The Rest Of The Market Many experienced investors claim that Bitcoin follows the NASDAQ, which is arguably true. But if you look at the historic charts below, it appears Bitcoin rises and falls with the waves of the global marketplace, but it's much more volatile than other equities. While it's a matter of opinion, it appears that Bitcoin most closely tracks the Russell 2000 index, which makes sense since it is more volatile than the NASDAQ, which is more volatile than the S&P 500 and The Dow. Fig. 2 How Bitcoin historical chart compares to Russell 2000, NASDAQ, S&P 500 (Yahoo.com) Market Fundamentals A steep market drop in the first week of August may have been the catalyst that prompted Fed Chair Jay Powell to announce that ""The time has come for policy to adjust"", a broad hint that there will be a drop in the prime rate shortly. Market watchers are assuming at the next FOMC meeting on September 17-18, the Fed will announce a quarter-point drop in the prime rate, maybe even a half-point. Rate-cut proponents predict lower rates will forestall a market sell-off and keep this bull market galloping. Cryptocurrency bulls are pawing the ground waiting for loose money freed up by the Fed to come washing into Bitcoin like an oncoming tide. But such rosy expectations are based on how the Fed Put has performed in the past. They don't take into account current market fundamentals. The Yen Carry Trade The first big quake in the markets this year did not come from Wall Street, or even Washington D.C. Rather it came from an unexpected quarter, our friend and long-standing ally, Japan. After three decades of a near-zero prime rate , the Bank of Japan raised the rate to 0.25%. What seemed like an insignificant increase set off a stampede for the exit of the yen/dollar carry trade. Over the first week of August, the S&P 500 dropped over 7%. Fig. 3 Yahoo.com The yen carry trade is a popular investment strategy wherein international investors borrow a large amount of yen at low interest rates and buy higher-yielding assets denominated in another currency, in this case, US stocks and bonds. In response to the market turmoil set off by the BOJ's quarter-point rate increase, the BOJ's Deputy Governor Shinishi Uchida announced that the central bank won't initiate further rate increases while the markets are unstable. Nonetheless, Japan is facing serious economic problems of its own. Primarily, the Japanese birthrate has plunged so far below replacement level that it has become an existential threat as the country's burgeoning population of elderly retired citizens are relying increasingly on an ever-dwindling population of workers for financial support. The big question was why. When Japanese officials looked into the matter what they discovered was jarring. Japanese working-class wages had dropped so low in comparison to the prior generation, adults in their 20s, 30s, and 40s claimed they weren't having children because they simply could not afford to, and they had no desire to force their prospective children to struggle in poverty. Last February Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Yoshimasa Hayashi , declared the condition critical and said that Japan had six years to restore the working class to its former prosperity to avoid an outright crisis. This indicates Japan's determination to reverse course on its longstanding zero-rate policy in order to raise wages. Financial officials, there are now embracing ""good inflation"", another indication they're willing to stay the course and endure whatever inconvenience comes with it. It all boils down to this. Japan has assured the US they will be as light-handed as humanly possible as they gradually raise rates. But like any other government, their priority is their nation's future. Japan must strengthen the yen and raise wages to give their working-class enough prosperity to afford a family. For Japan, this is not a nice-to-have, it is an absolute must-have. And as their chief cabinet secretary has recently announced, they want to see dramatic results in six years. The Unintended Consequences of Rate Cuts While rate cuts have become a market shibboleth, promising a one-size-fits-all cure for every recession, they may have become a way to forestall an inevitable round of belt-tightening, both on Wall Street and in our government. Loose money policies offer little more than a bigger credit line. When governments overuse this dubious solution, numerous risk factors can accumulate. A rate cut reduces incentive to buy long-term bonds When bond rates go lower, the price goes higher since the two are inversely related. That means that as rates come down, the incentive to buy US Treasuries goes down along with it. Meanwhile, the government is determined to sell a record amount of bonds to pay for a record-breaking budget, including interest on a record-breaking debt. This predicament is just one of several Catch-22s woven into the bond math. Foreign buyers of US Treasuries have been declining over the past decade or so. Raising rates would likely send even more foreign buyers running for the exits. Fig. 4 Share of U.S. Treasury Securities (Created by CRS. Data from Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve) Fig. 5 Foreign Direct Investment (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis) Inflation One likely outcome of a rate cut is higher inflation which could trigger a forceful backlash from the middle class, still furious about the high rate of inflation that took the economy by surprise at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. The fact we are now in the dead heat of a presidential election year means this issue could bring a great deal of pressure on the Fed to reverse course, both from the electorate and the current administration. Bear in mind that most financial experts agree that Wall Street traders have already priced several rate cuts into these current stock price valuations. If the Fed does cut rates, and then does a quick about-face, this could spell disaster for the stock market. Traders would likely reverse their expectations of another bull run and price in their expectations for rising rates instead. Such expectations might trigger a sell-off. A Rate Cut Could Spur Profit-taking Among Bondholders The reason the 10-year Treasury rates have been trailing behind the 2-year Treasury (until very recently) is because the former has been in much higher demand than the 2-year. If bond traders are assuming that there are a series of rate cuts in our future, it would make sense for them to load up on 10-year bonds, and then sell them into the secondary market at a profit once the rates drop. As the Fed lowers rates, the incentive to buy the 10-year to take advantage of the higher rate dries up. Meanwhile, the incentive to sell at a profit increases. So even as demand wanes, the supply is likely to increase, driving down the price of bonds. If this scenario plays out the interest rates on bonds would likely trend up at the government auctions. Lowering rates in this scenario could turn into a negative feedback loop as the very act makes bonds less attractive. The Yen Carry Trade Redux Since investors driving the yen/dollar carry trade are taking advantage of the differential between the BOJ's historically low prime rate and the Fed's considerably higher prime rate, any financial move that closes that gap could set off another rush for the exits of this financial gambit as we saw in the first week of August. This could cause more downward pressure on stock prices. Rate Cuts Could Invite US Bond Rating Downgrade Another risk of lowering interest rates is that it could invite a credit rating downgrade to US Treasuries. In August of last year, Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S. long-term credit rating from AAA to AA+. It doesn't sound like much, but this was only the second time in history that a prestigious credit rating agency downgraded US bonds. The reasons given were as follows. The US's soaring national debt. The lack of a plan to address solutions for the debt. The deterioration of good governance. Later that year in November, Moody's Investor Services reduced its outlook on US credit ratings from ""stable"" to ""negative"". While the credit rating agency kept the US's top credit rating at AAA, rather than downgrading it, the announcement was likely intended as a warning shot across the US government's bow. The Yield Curve Reversion Perhaps the most reliable recession indicator is the yield curve reversion. Most experienced investors are aware that yield curve inversions nearly always precede a recession. The only question is by how long? The yield curve inversion of the 10-year Treasury and the 2-year Treasury recently set a record for the length of time it has been inverted-for over two years according to the St. Louis Fed's yield curve inversion charts. The 10-year Treasury and the 2-year Treasury inverted in July 2022. This yield curve has recently crept above the zero line like a thief in the night-first on August 28, more recently on September 4th. Notice that recessions, represented by the vertical gray bars, come either shortly or immediately after the yield curve comes back above the zero line. Fig. 6 10-Year Treasury Minus 2-Year Treasury (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis) Yield Curve Reversions Can Signal Two-Year Outlook For A Market Bottom Let's take a close look at the mechanics of the Treasury yield reversion process to see what's going on. The 10-year Treasury typically pays a higher interest rate than the 2-year Treasury because of the greater risk involved in holding a security for a long period of time. But sometimes market forces push the 10-year yield below the 2-year yield in what's known as a yield-curve-inversion. The dynamics behind this trend are generally institutional bond investors buying up 10-year notes with the expectation that rates will drop in response to a future recession. Since the Fed generally lowers rates after a recessionary stock market drop, the bond traders are confident they can sell their high-yield 10-year notes at a profit before their term. So, now the question is, what market mechanics are suddenly making the 2-year notes more popular than the 10-year notes? Mapping the dates of the 10-year/2-year reversions on an S&P 500 historical chart is revealing. Fig. 7 S&P 500 Chart 1990-2010 (Yahoo.com) As you can see from the chart above, there is roughly a 2-year interval between when the rate of the 2-year Treasury dips back below the rate of the 10-year, and the S&P 500 reaches a market bottom after a steep downturn. Could this be the bond traders' collective self-fulfilling prophecy? Or do the most successful bond traders have a witching-rod instinct for knowing when a steep market correction is near? If the latter is the case, then it appears bond traders are switching from Phase I, loading up on the 10-year bond in anticipation of recession on the horizon, to Phase II, shifting to the 2-year Treasury in anticipation of a near-term recession, followed by excellent buying opportunities in two years. Whichever it is, there seems to be a correlation between the reversion of the yield curve and a bottoming of the stock market roughly 2 years later. It will be interesting to see if this pattern holds in the coming 2 years. Why Squeezed Investors Are Likely To Sell Bitcoin First In a recessionary environment, experienced investors are likely to exit Bitcoin first specifically because it is so extremely volatile. Any signals the markets are weakening could trigger a massive Bitcoin sell-off. After reaching over $73,800 in mid-March this year, Bitcoin has been easing off its most recent high. While Bitcoin could get an initial sugar rush from a Fed rate drop, the overall market fundamentals will likely catch up and make it short-lived. Fig. 8 Yahoo.com Caveat Most market watchers believe that Fed rate cuts will spur equities across the board, and Bitcoin stands to be a big beneficiary. If they're proven right, anyone who sells Bitcoin now could miss out on that second bull market. A Final Word About Bitcoin Cyber currency detractors believe the value of Bitcoin is completely illusionary because it is intangible. But the blockchain technology upon which Bitcoin is based is here to stay. Cyber currency tracked on a public blockchain ledger is here to stay. That genie will not be stuffed back in the bottle any time soon. So, it stands to reason if Bitcoin is the most popular cyber currency, it too is here to stay. Its value will likely continue to rise and fall in dramatic fashion but any prediction that Bitcoin will soon disappear from the world stage is a prediction that cyber currency will disappear, and that argument doesn't make sense. Summary Numerous forward indicators are signaling a recession on the near horizon. While Bitcoin has a short history, it has already demonstrated a pattern of following the ebbs and flows of the market, but in a much more volatile fashion than the rest of the equities and market indexes. If the global economy succumbs to a recession, Bitcoin will likely fall faster and further than the rest of the market, as it has already demonstrated.

33518670,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641630,1726180220,"Bitcoin Price Forecast: Trump Win Could Boost BTC To $125,000, Standard Chartered","Geoff Kendrick, the Head of Crypto Research at Standard Chartered Bank, has put forth bullish predictions regarding the Bitcoin price trajectory in the event of the 2024 US presidential election. Bitcoin Price Predictions Soar According to a CNBC report, Kendrick posits that a potential re-election of Donald Trump could propel Bitcoin to a staggering $125,000 mark. However, he also indicates that Bitcoin is poised to reach new all-time highs regardless of the election outcome, with an anticipated value of $75,000 if Vice President Kamala Harris secures the presidency. Elaborating on the election’s implications on the cryptocurrency landscape, Kendrick highlights that while the political scenario will undoubtedly influence the Bitcoin market, the perceived risks associated with a Harris presidency might be exaggerated. Related Reading: Challenges Mount For Bitcoin Miners As Difficulty Surges To Record High According to Kendrick’s analysis, the Bitcoin price is projected to conclude 2024 at record highs under either election scenario, nearing the $125,000 threshold under a Trump victory or hovering around $75,000 in a Harris administration. In the wake of a potential Harris win. However, an initial price dip could occur, Kendrick asserts that market participants would likely view such declines as buying opportunities, given the expectation of continued regulatory advancements. Contrary to industry apprehensions regarding Harris potentially adopting a stringent stance towards Bitcoin, Kendrick contends that her administration would likely exhibit a more favorable outlook towards digital assets than a potential second term under President Biden. Moreover, Standard Chartered remains optimistic about the Bitcoin price future, maintaining a bullish stance by forecasting a surge to $200,000 by the conclusion of 2025, irrespective of the election outcome this year. Potential Q4 Rally For BTC Evaluating the current state of the Bitcoin market, crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades shed light on BTC’s historical performance trends in September. Despite the general observation that Bitcoin tends to face challenges in September, Daan assesses that whether at the beginning of a bullish trend, in the later stages of previous market cycles, or even in a bearish phase, September typically marks a local bottom followed by a subsequent up move in the fourth quarter. Recently, Bitcoin encountered two significant downturns, notably on August 5, when it dropped nearly 25%, causing the price to plummet to as low as $49,000. Subsequently, another retracement occurred on September 6, pushing the price to $52,000. However, amidst these fluctuations, Bitcoin has shown resilience by trading at $58,360, indicating strong support along the macro uptrend line. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Accumulation: Whales Pull Out $4 Million From Exchanges, Can SHIB Recover? Moreover, Daan Crypto Trades emphasizes that a considerable portion of BTC’s liquidity remains at higher levels. This observation aligns with the price effectively clearing out historical levels from approximately the past six months during the sharp decline witnessed in early August. Highlighting a pivotal level to monitor, the analyst underscores the significance of surpassing the $65,000 mark. Breaking this level would signify the formation of a local higher high, potentially paving the way towards targeting the liquidity at $70,000.

33516953,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641440,1726176638,XRP Price To Reach $40? Crypto Analyst Says You Should Get In Right Now,"A crypto analyst is mega bullish on the future outlook of the XRP price, predicting a massive price surge to $40 for cryptocurrency. Despite XRP’s stagnant price growth over the years, this crypto analyst remains confident in the cryptocurrency’s short-term and long-term prospects. XRP Surge Incoming, Don’t Panic Sell XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is currently showing incredibly bullish signals according to ‘Steph Is Crypto,’ a market expert on X (formerly Twitter). Sharing a video discussing his analysis of the XRP chart, Steph Is Crypto disclosed that cryptocurrency is gearing up for a substantial breakout in the immediate short term. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Is In A ‘Healthier’ Place Now, Here’s Why The analyst disclosed that XRP is currently shaping a “larger inverted head and shoulders” technical pattern. As a result, he predicted that a breakout would be confirmed in XRP when a daily candle was seen close to the neckline at the $0.65 level. Once XRP closes above this crucial price level, the cryptocurrency could witness a price increase to $1.11, representing a 106% surge from its current value. Steph Is Crypto further revealed that on the monthly time frame, XRP’s price is getting closer to the apex of its distinctive symmetrical triangle pattern. A symmetrical triangle is a neutral chart formation consisting of two converging trend lines that suggest a potential price breakthrough after a period of sideways trading. Based on XRP’s triangle chart pattern, the analyst believes that the cryptocurrency could experience a massive price surge to $40 in the next few weeks. Considering the ambitious nature of this price forecast, Steph Is Crypto has warned investors to take it with a grain of salt, noting the market’s unpredictable nature. However, should XRP break above the downward-sloping resistance line on its symmetrical triangle pattern, the cryptocurrency could see a rapid move to the upside. A jump to $40 would mean that the XRP will require a 75.5% rally from its present price of $0.53. Looking at the Fear and Greed index of the broader crypto market, the majority of investors are in a fearful state due to the recent market decline and volatility. However, Steph In Crypto has urged XRP investors to stay bullish, emphasizing that now is the worst time to panic sell their holdings.

33514907,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641397,1726171258,Injective (INJ) Breaks $18 Resistance: Investors Expect Higher Prices,"Injective (INJ) has been outperforming the broader crypto market in recent hours, gaining over 19% since Monday, while most cryptocurrencies have experienced declines of 2% to 4% since yesterday. Related Reading: Is Chainlink (LINK) $12 Breakout Imminent? Data Reveals A Rising Open Interest This strong performance comes after the altcoin broke through the $18 resistance level, signaling bullish momentum. Investors and analysts are now eyeing higher prices for INJ, with some suggesting it could be poised for even more significant gains shortly. However, INJ must test key supply levels and establish support within critical demand zones for this uptrend to continue. The current optimism surrounding Injective is backed by encouraging price action, but sustained upward movement will be needed to confirm a lasting trend. As the market watches closely, INJ’s ability to hold these levels may determine its potential for further growth in the coming days. Injective Setting New Local Highs Injective (INJ) has experienced a strong surge after days of choppy and uncertain price action. Now, trading above the 4-hour $18 resistance, the altcoin has ignited excitement among investors and analysts, who believe INJ could be a top performer in this market cycle. One notable analyst, Crypto General on X, has shared his technical perspective on INJ, setting high expectations for a $53 price target in the coming months. His analysis points out that INJ is currently rebounding from its lower trendline support, a critical level that has served as a foundation for this rally. According to Crypto General, INJ could experience a powerful upward movement if this support holds. However, he also warns that if the price fails to maintain this level, we could see a decline toward the $14 range, which would signal a reversal of recent gains. Investors are carefully watching this development, as INJ’s recent price action could set the stage for more significant moves in the near term. The key will be whether INJ maintains its momentum and breaks through resistance levels. If bulls can push the price above its next resistance zone, a rally toward the mid-$20 range could be on the horizon, further solidifying its position in the market. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Surges Past $130 Resistance As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum As the market establishes its direction, price action in the coming days will play a pivotal role in determining INJ’s performance in the weeks ahead. Whether it continues to rise or faces a pullback will likely depend on broader market conditions and the ability of bulls to sustain upward momentum. INJ Price Action Details INJ is trading at $19.38 after a significant surge from yearly lows near $15. This upward movement has propelled the price above the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $18.41 for the first time since late August. The 4H 200 EMA is a crucial indicator of short-term market strength. If INJ can successfully retest and hold above this level, it would suggest a bullish continuation, signaling that further upward momentum is likely. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Ready To Target $28: Investors Expect A Reversal Maintaining this position above the 4H 200 EMA would allow INJ to target higher price levels, with resistance and supply zones near $23 as the next key hurdle. However, if the price fails to hold this level and loses support at $18, a retrace toward lower demand zones around $16 could occur. In the short term, how INJ behaves around the 4H 200 EMA will be pivotal in shaping its next price action phase.

With an upward trend in Helium’s performance and a growing sense of optimism within its community, experts are now turning their focus to another emerging crypto project Mpeppe (MPEPE) which is generating significant buzz for its unique blend of features. In this article, we explore how Helium (HNT) is impacting the market and why Mpeppe stands out as a noteworthy investment opportunity. Helium’s Rise: Why It’s Gaining Momentum Helium (HNT) has been making headlines due to its consistent upward trajectory and growing community support. Originally developed as a decentralized network for the Internet of Things (IoT), Helium (HNT) has been able to expand its use case while maintaining a strong position within the crypto space. The Helium community is particularly excited about recent developments, including Helium airdrops and increasing network utility. A recent step-by-step guide has helped users discover hidden Helium airdrop opportunities. Airdrops are a popular way for projects like Helium (HNT) to reward their community by distributing free tokens. But as the crypto space grows, so do scams, and it’s crucial for users to remain vigilant when participating in airdrops. To safely claim airdrops, users are advised to verify sources, avoid sharing private keys, and use reputable wallets like Trust Wallet to secure their assets. The Community’s Role in Helium’s Success The Helium (HNT) community plays a crucial role in the project’s success. The decentralized nature of Helium (HNT) has allowed it to thrive, with individuals all over the world contributing to its expansion. The rise of Helium’s network has led to more community-driven initiatives, further bolstering its position as a top-tier project. This momentum has created positive sentiment among Helium (HNT) holders, with many investors seeing it as a long-term investment. For those looking to participate in Helium’s ecosystem, avoiding scams is essential. Common schemes, such as phishing scams and fake token distributions, have targeted the Helium (HNT) community, which is why users need to be particularly cautious when engaging with airdrop opportunities. By following best practices, such as verifying official sources and using secure wallets, investors can safely navigate the world of Helium (HNT) airdrops while protecting their assets. Mpeppe: The New Star in the Meme Coin Universe As Helium (HNT) continues to soar, another project has caught the eye of crypto enthusiasts, Mpeppe (MPEPE). While Helium (HNT) focuses on revolutionizing the IoT sector, Mpeppe is disrupting the meme coin space with its innovative features and growing ecosystem. Mpeppe has quickly gained traction, drawing comparisons to major meme coins while offering much more in terms of utility and functionality. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on internet culture, Mpeppe integrates decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, staking opportunities, and even a casino platform. This combination of entertainment and real-world utility has set Mpeppe apart from other projects, making it a favorite among younger investors looking for high-reward opportunities. What Makes Mpeppe Unique? Mpeppe (MPEPE) leverages the viral nature of meme coins but with added features that provide long-term value to its holders. For example, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s DeFi platform allows users to stake their tokens, earn rewards, and participate in liquidity mining, making it more than just a speculative asset. This utility has contributed to its rising popularity and growing community, which shares similar levels of excitement seen in the Helium ecosystem. By incorporating features such as yield farming, NFT-based rewards, and even a gaming ecosystem, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is drawing significant interest from a diverse range of investors. Its ability to attract not just meme coin enthusiasts but also serious investors speaks volumes about its potential for long-term growth. Why Ethereum and Helium Whales Are Paying Attention to Mpeppe Much like Helium (HNT), Mpeppe (MPEPE) has attracted the attention of large investors, often referred to as whales. These big players have recognized the potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE) and are betting on its ability to deliver impressive returns. Some Ethereum (ETH) whales, who are already experienced in the cryptocurrency market, have started to shift their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a way to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on its potential for explosive growth. The recent performance of Helium has served as a blueprint for how a strong community and innovative features can propel a project to success. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain traction, it may follow a similar path, becoming a dominant force in the meme coin space. For investors seeking new opportunities in the ever-evolving world of crypto, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique blend of entertainment, DeFi functionality, and high-profit potential. Conclusion: Helium and Mpeppe Leading the Charge Both Helium (HNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are making waves in the cryptocurrency market, albeit in different ways. Helium’s role in advancing the IoT ecosystem and its community-driven approach has earned it a loyal following, while Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s blend of meme culture and utility is attracting a wide range of investors. For those looking to capitalize on the next big crypto opportunity, these two projects should certainly be on the radar. As Helium continues its upward trend, its community remains strong, focusing on safe and secure participation in airdrops. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is riding the wave of meme coin popularity while offering real utility that sets it apart from the rest. Both projects exemplify the future of cryptocurrency, one that blends community engagement with innovative solutions, offering investors exciting opportunities for growth.

33513422,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641572,1726167620,Starknet Dips and Ethereum Investors Hunt For Gains From New Casino Coin Mpeppe (MPEPE),"Starknet (STRK), a Layer-2 scaling solution on Ethereum (ETH), is currently experiencing a bearish trend, which has prompted many Ethereum (ETH) investors to look elsewhere for potential gains. One project that has caught their eye is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new casino coin that promises significant returns, attracting attention amidst the downturn in Starknet. Starknet’s (STRK) Recent Performance Starknet (STRK) saw a 3% drop recently, despite a broader upswing in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin surged past $57,000, and many altcoins followed suit, recording gains across the board. Yet, Starknet (STRK) struggled, primarily due to an over-the-counter (OTC) sale involving Three Arrows Capital (3AC), the now-defunct crypto hedge fund. A wallet associated with 3AC transferred over 2 million STRK tokens (worth about $856,000 USD) to Wintermute for an OTC sale, causing market participants to speculate on the token’s future. Such large transfers from insolvent companies often signal impending asset liquidation, which can drive prices down. As a result, the bearish sentiment surrounding Starknet (STRK) has only intensified, with the token now hovering at around $0.4137 USD. This bearish movement comes as a surprise, especially with the wider crypto market seeing gains. While Bitcoin recorded a 3.55% gain over 24 hours, Starknet (STRK)’s failure to ride the wave left it at a critical juncture. The liquidations associated with 3AC are expected to continue influencing the market, and further selling pressure could be on the horizon for STRK. What’s Next for Starknet? Analysts are concerned that Starknet (STRK) may continue its downward trajectory in the short term, especially if more 3AC-associated wallets begin offloading large amounts of tokens. With the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) suggesting a further decline, Starknet (STRK)’s price recovery seems unlikely in the immediate future. For now, Starknet (STRK) continues to trade below its crucial resistance levels, and while the broader market is experiencing a bullish sentiment, Starknet (STRK)’s troubles are tied directly to its association with 3AC. Until these liquidation concerns are resolved, Starknet (STRK) is expected to face headwinds. Ethereum (ETH) Investors Turn to Mpeppe (MPEPE) for Gains As Starknet (STRK) struggles, Ethereum (ETH) investors are hunting for alternative investment opportunities that offer better short-term returns. Enter Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new casino coin that has rapidly gained popularity among investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Priced at $0.0021, Mpeppe is currently in the presale phase and has garnered significant attention due to its innovative approach to decentralized gambling. Ethereum (ETH) whales, particularly those who have been actively trading Starknet (STRK), are now looking at Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a potential source of substantial profits. Many believe that Mpeppe’s unique gambling mechanics and meme appeal will attract a broad user base, driving up demand once the coin is fully launched. Why Mpeppe is Attracting Investors High Potential for Returns: Mpeppe is still in its early stages, which means that early adopters have the opportunity to ride the coin’s explosive growth. With its presale nearing completion, analysts predict that Mpeppe could see a significant price surge once it is listed on major exchanges, with some estimates suggesting a 150% increase in value in the short term. Decentralized Gambling: Mpeppe’s casino-based model taps into the growing trend of decentralized gaming and gambling. With more users turning to decentralized platforms for both entertainment and profit, Mpeppe offers a novel way for investors to participate in the space while earning rewards. Appeal to Ethereum (ETH) Investors: Many Ethereum (ETH) investors, disillusioned with the recent performance of projects like Starknet (STRK), are flocking to Mpeppe (MPEPE). The token’s low entry price, combined with its promising fundamentals, makes it an attractive option for those looking to diversify away from Ethereum (ETH)-related projects while still benefiting from the broader crypto market. The Future of Starknet and Mpeppe While Starknet (STRK) continues to face challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is rapidly gaining momentum as a potential high-growth token. Ethereum (ETH) investors who have historically supported projects like Starknet are now diversifying into Mpeppe, hoping to capitalize on its potential for explosive growth. In the short term, Starknet’s outlook remains uncertain. The continued liquidation of 3AC’s assets could push the token’s price down further, especially if more large transfers occur. Meanwhile, Mpeppe is positioned for success, with its unique casino model appealing to a wide range of investors looking for high returns. Conclusion As Starknet (STRK) dips amidst broader market fluctuations and the continued liquidation of 3AC’s assets, investors are turning to alternative opportunities like Mpeppe (MPEPE). With its presale nearing completion and strong investor interest, Mpeppe is well-positioned to deliver significant returns in the coming months. For Ethereum (ETH) investors seeking high-growth opportunities, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a promising alternative amidst Starknet’s ongoing struggles.

Recently, Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme-based token with a twist, has captured the attention of Ethereum (ETH) and Starknet (STRK) whales, sparking interest with its innovative platform and impressive performance in a challenging market. With experts predicting potential 150x profits, it’s no wonder these major players are diving into Mpeppe as a lucrative investment opportunity. Mpeppe’s Meteoric Rise: More Than Just a Meme Coin Mpeppe (MPEPE) initially made waves in the market due to its humorous, meme-inspired origins, but it quickly proved to be much more than just a joke. Backed by a robust ecosystem that integrates decentralized finance (DeFi) and a burgeoning casino and gaming platform, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has established itself as a serious contender in the crypto space. Investors have been attracted not only to its fun branding but also to its real-world utility, with many seeing long-term value in its innovative offerings. The project’s unique combination of meme culture and DeFi protocols has helped it stand out in a crowded market, and its rapidly growing user base continues to fuel its upward trajectory. As a result, large investors, including Ethereum (ETH) and Starknet (STRK) whales, are taking notice and reallocating funds into Mpeppe (MPEPE) in search of explosive profits. Ethereum Whales Pivot Towards Mpeppe Historically, Ethereum (ETH) whales have held large positions in the major cryptocurrency thanks to its dominant position in the market and its versatile blockchain that supports thousands of decentralized applications (dApps). However, Ethereum (ETH) has faced increasing challenges, particularly around scalability and high gas fees, which have driven many large investors to explore other opportunities. This shift in sentiment has led some of Ethereum (ETH)’s biggest holders to invest in promising altcoins like Mpeppe (MPEPE). As Ethereum (ETH) continues to work through its scalability issues with Layer-2 solutions such as Starknet (STRK), investors are diversifying their portfolios, seeking new avenues for growth, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly become one of their top choices. Starknet Whales Eye Mpeppe for Huge Returns Meanwhile, Starknet (STRK), a Layer-2 solution designed to improve Ethereum (ETH)’s transaction speed and reduce fees, has also seen its whale investors pivoting toward Mpeppe (MPEPE). Starknet (STRK) has been gaining attention for its ability to enhance Ethereum (ETH)’s performance by processing transactions off-chain before settling them back on-chain, significantly reducing costs. However, as the broader market becomes more competitive, Starknet (STRK)’s whales are now exploring other high-reward investments. Enter Mpeppe (MPEPE)—a token that not only delivers on the promise of fast gains but also offers an exciting, utility-packed ecosystem. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s casino and DeFi platforms allow users to participate in staking, liquidity mining, and yield farming, making it an attractive option for investors looking to capitalize on both short- and long-term profits. Why Mpeppe Is Attracting Big Money Investors There are several key reasons why Mpeppe (MPEPE) has piqued the interest of Ethereum (ETH) and Starknet (STRK) whales, who are known for their strategic investments: 150x Potential Returns: Analysts have been eyeing Mpeppe (MPEPE) for its potential to deliver returns of up to 150x in the near future. This kind of growth is precisely what big-money investors are looking for in a volatile yet rewarding market. A Strong and Engaged Community: Mpeppe (MPEPE) has grown a loyal following due to its engaging branding and strong presence in the meme coin community. A solid, engaged user base is critical for the long-term success of any cryptocurrency, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) has managed to capture the attention of younger, tech-savvy investors. Innovative Ecosystem: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is more than just a meme token—it’s a complete ecosystem that integrates DeFi and gaming. Its casino platform has particularly caught the eye of many investors, offering a real-world application that sets it apart from many other meme coins on the market. Diversification Opportunity: For Ethereum (ETH) and Starknet (STRK) whales looking to hedge their positions in the market, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a way to diversify their portfolios without abandoning their investments in more established tokens. What’s Next for Mpeppe? As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain traction, its roadmap includes expanding its DeFi offerings, launching new features within its casino and gaming ecosystem, and increasing user engagement through strategic partnerships and promotions. The potential for growth is enormous, and as more Ethereum (ETH) and Starknet (STRK) whales pile in, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is likely to see even greater adoption in the months to come. In a market where timing is everything, savvy investors are already positioning themselves to take advantage of Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rise. With forecasts suggesting massive returns, it’s no surprise that whales are moving quickly to secure their positions in this exciting project. Conclusion: Mpeppe’s Bright Future While Ethereum (ETH) and Starknet (STRK) continue to be pillars of the blockchain ecosystem, it’s clear that Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a fresh, exciting opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on rapid growth. By combining meme culture with real-world utility, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has carved out a unique niche in the crypto market and is well-positioned for explosive gains in the near future. For Ethereum (ETH) and Starknet (STRK) whales, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a new frontier, one that promises the potential for 150x profits and beyond.

33513418,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641567,1726167603,Internet Computer and Mpeppe Two Cryptos That Have Provided Their Holders Massive Gains In September,"As we enter the final quarter of 2024, two cryptocurrencies have been making headlines for providing impressive returns to their holders: Internet Computer (ICP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Both of these cryptos have exhibited strong price movements in September, catching the eye of investors and analysts alike. With major technological developments and market shifts happening in both projects, the future looks promising. Let’s take a closer look at why these two tokens have gained so much momentum and what’s next for them. Internet Computer (ICP): AI Integration and Expanding Influence Internet Computer (ICP) has been a key player in the blockchain space, and its latest advancements are pushing it to the forefront of decentralized applications (dApps). ICP’s major development in 2024 has been its seamless integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into its blockchain infrastructure. This innovative move has opened up new possibilities for developers to create decentralized apps that utilize AI for tasks like automated trading, predictive analytics, and complex decision-making processes. ICP allows developers to run websites and services directly on the blockchain, bypassing the need for traditional cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud. With the introduction of AI capabilities, developers can now build even more advanced and automated dApps. This has positioned Internet Computer (ICP) as a go-to platform for the future of decentralized web services, drawing the attention of a growing number of investors and developers. The bullish sentiment around Internet Computer (ICP) is reflected in its price movement. In September, Internet Computer (ICP) charted a 14% gain, reaching as high as $9.1.

42407650,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0P4b,1726166317,Building on Bitcoin in the Age of Web3,"On May 23, 2014, a few days after Credit Suisse pled guilty in a $2.6 billion settlement, Edmund Moy, Director of the United States Mint between 2006 to 2011, had an epiphany. Seeing public statements from the bank’s chief executive, Brady W. Dougan, hours after the charges were announced — criminal charges for a conspiracy that helped their wealthiest clients evade American taxes for decades — which said the fine “won’t do much damage,” Moy wrote on X, “It's time banks got competition.”  The experience inspired him to write “The Currency Revolution, Courtesy of Bitcoin,” and to articulate a philosophy that put Bitcoin at the center of a movement he recognized as having the ultimate aim of disrupting money, payments, and all areas of finance. Through his own experience in the financial establishment, Moy started to believe Bitcoin could disrupt “traditional notions” of currencies, banking, and financial technology as a whole by ushering in a permissionless, decentralized financial system.  Bitcoin was buzzing with invention in those early years, and progress toward the guiding ethos of disrupting traditional finance seemed to be speeding up as a result. Tether launched on Bitcoin during this time, primitive decentralized exchanges like Bisq were launched for Bitcoin traders, and tokens – fungible and non-fungible – popped up like weeds, also on Bitcoin. The industry’s mood was a mix of exuberance, anxiety, and greed.  Solana, Ethereum, and other blockchains have spent years capitalizing on Bitcoin’s near complete stagnation  The vision Moy articulated was shared by nearly every Bitcoin enthusiast, but opinions on how to actualize these ideas of decentralized money and finance differed widely. From stablecoins to NFTs, almost every category of application commonly used in the decentralized finance industry today has its roots in Bitcoin, but a strong ideological undercurrent started to create a cultural shift toward discouraging and combating these projects. From Satoshi Dice in 2012 to Ordinals in 2024, Bitcoin’s history is littered with experimental projects that have been lambasted for spamming, polluting, or distracting the Bitcoin community from its mission. As a result, the developers, users, and capital that could have flowed to an industry of financial applications running on Bitcoin were incrementally pushed to other public blockchains.  Imagine creating a new financial system with a strong currency and nowhere to use it. That would be the inevitable outcome for Bitcoin if this anti-innovation movement was successful. Thankfully, they were not as the industry has witnessed over the past two years with inscriptions, runes, new layer-two networks, and other types of innovative projects being built on and around Bitcoin. Billions of dollars from professional investors and retail speculators alike have poured into kickstarting what many market participants see as a new era for Bitcoin, but in reality, it marks a cultural return to Bitcoin’s original mission of disrupting and decentralizing the world of finance.  Bitcoin is the best public blockchain in this industry of thousands of competitors. Bitcoin not only has the largest and most recognizable brand inside and outside the cryptocurrency industry, it also controls the largest pool of capital in crypto, which sits just over $1 trillion today. Bitcoin is also the most battle-tested public blockchain in the world with thousands of nodes running around the world and 100% network uptime for 11 consecutive years. Bitcoin is the biggest, most secure, most decentralized, most reliable permissionless financial network in the world. Building on Bitcoin means building on the best.  But Bitcoin has a lot of catching up to do. Solana, Ethereum, and other blockchains have spent years capitalizing on Bitcoin’s near complete stagnation by incubating ecosystems that are home to hundreds of applications, thousands of users, and billions of dollars. Even the Lightning Network, which has long been the darling of the “anti-DeFi” sect in Bitcoin, has seen the number of coins held on its network stagnant for years.  Now is the time to recommit to making Bitcoin the home of innovation and experimentation in the cryptocurrency industry again. If Bitcoin is not the gateway to permissionless finance for new users, we will have failed. If Bitcoin becomes nothing more than an asset custodied by ETF providers, we will have failed. If the world’s best form of money is not adopted alongside the development of a native financial system powered by Bitcoin, we will have failed. The technocultural norms and habits that have arrested Bitcoin development for years must be stomped out completely.  Building the future of money and finance on Bitcoin requires an army of builders. In the past two years, hundreds of new founders and engineers have started building on Bitcoin, but that number needs to continue growing. At Botanix Labs, we are developing one piece of Bitcoin’s future with a Layer 2 network called the Spiderchain. But everyone building anything with Bitcoin should be proud to be among this multitude of people collaborating with each other to bootstrap a decentralized financial ecosystem. Bitcoin’s best days are still ahead thanks to the combined efforts of this group of builders.  Bitcoin is a civilization-altering invention that should empower ordinary people to escape control of a financial system that is so concentrated and censored. But Bitcoin needs to cultivate an alternative financial system to replace its incumbents. Experimentation and innovation should be core tenets in this new financial era of transparency, decentralization, and permissionlessness. What Moy and thousands of others see as Bitcoin’s future for finance is up to all of us to actualize. Considering all that is at stake, we have to at least try.

33512709,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641419,1726165813,"As Bitcoin Supply Tightens, Could A Breakout Be On The Horizon?","Recent changes in the behavior of Bitcoin on the market suggest the coin could be preparing for its next significant bull run. One important consideration is the fall in Bitcoin reserves on exchanges. Less of Bitcoin is accessible for trading as owners migrate it to cold storage. Historically, this kind of decrease usually comes before significant price rises. Related Reading: AAVE Excites Investors With 20% Gain As Developments Roll Out Declining Bitcoin Reserve Reserves of Bitcoin on exchanges have been declining drastically. This drop means that everyday traders are losing control over the crypto while it is being transferred to cold storage. Recent data by CryptoQuant amply illustrates this trend. Usually, declining exchange reserves for Bitcoin point to declining selling pressure. This thus produces conditions fit for possible price increase. Looking back at past trends, such declines in reserves have sometimes been accompanied by somewhat substantial price swings. Bitcoin’s Next Bull Run? “Decreasing #Bitcoin reserves and rising stablecoin reserves indicate a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. As the market supply tightens and buying power builds, we could be on the verge of a price rally.” – By @OnchainTarek Link 👇https://t.co/frUAfdSBrk pic.twitter.com/4fxB9cowf1 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) September 11, 2024 Regular Withdrawal Patterns Supporting these observations, further understanding comes from IntoTheBlock’s netflow data. Over many time periods, the data shows a constant pattern of Bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges. Bitcoin saw a net loss of 8.03K BTC in the past 24 hours alone, while 6.29K BTC was taken out throughout last week. The netflow has been negative even during the past month. This consistent loss of Bitcoin from markets supports the belief that investors are clinging to their assets, maybe waiting for more favorable conditions to sell. Increase In Stablecoin Reserves Apart from the declining BTC holdings, stablecoin reserves on exchanges clearly have increased. This increase speaks to market liquidity rising. Usually, traders are getting ready for opportunities for future purchase. Increase in USDT stablecoin holdings on exchanges since August “When stablecoins flow into exchanges and increase their holdings, it is generally interpreted as funds waiting to buy, which will have a positive effect on the price.” – By @Yonsei_dent Link 👇… pic.twitter.com/wsrY0rCFaC — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) September 10, 2024 Stablecoins are easily accessible pool of money ready for swift deployment. More stablecoins entering the market indicate that investors are ready to seize possibilities, which may cause a major price breakout. Looking ahead, institutional interest and macroeconomic elements are also rather important in determining the possible price trajectory of Bitcoin. Although past rate increases by the Federal Reserve have slowed down the crypto asset’s expansion, possible rate reduction could create a more suitable habitat for the BTC. Furthermore increased institutional demand spurred by potential approval of physical exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could help to further increase Bitcoin’s liquidity and general acceptance. Related Reading: Analysts Predict XRP ‘Mega Pump’ And ‘Perpetual Cycle’ – Details Bitcoin Price Forecast The future of Bitcoin excites experts; some estimate a price of $100,000 by 2025. Macroeconomic changes and increasing institutional participation help to encourage this positive attitude. With the decline in exchange reserves and increase in stablecoin reserves, the present market dynamics point to Bitcoin perhaps preparing the ground for its next significant surge. The indicators suggest a possible Bitcoin bull run. The backdrop created by declining reserves on exchanges, rising stablecoin liquidity, and consistent withdrawal patterns should help to support notable price rises. With improving macroeconomic conditions and rising institutional interest, Bitcoin’s road to $100,000 by 2025 seems increasingly feasible.

42417263,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXkSL,1726165749,EToro Settles With the SEC: Industry Lawyers React,"Trading platform eToro agreed Thursday to settle charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it operated as an unregistered broker and clearing agency and that it facilitated trading in some crypto assets that are securities. The agreement sees eToro paying a $1.5 million fine and means the company will be limited to trading just three digital assets: bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and ether (ETH).  Etoro, which is based in Israel, is not a big player in the U.S. crypto market. It has only 240,000 customer accounts compared to Coinbase's 100 million. But the SEC agreement is significant for the clues it offers about how the regulator views the key legal question of which digital assets are not securities, and therefore outside its supervision, lawyers contacted by CoinDesk said.  Below is a sampling of reactions from leading digital asset-focused attorneys:  Joseph Tully, securities litigation lawyer at Tully & Weiss:  “It appears that the SEC has officially sanctioned BTC, BCH, and ETH so we know that the SEC considers at least those three to be commodities and not securities. The key words here [are] at ‘at least.’ There may be others, but there is no legal guidance based upon this settlement.”  Lowell Ness, partner at Perkins Coie:  “It’s interesting to see parties agreeing to this kind of drastic settlement when viewed against federal court rulings holding that programmatic trades are not securities transactions. This settlement highlights the huge gap that may be developing between regulators and some of the early court decisions.”  Drew Hinkes, Partner with K&L Gates:  Joshua Ashley Klayman, U.S. Head of Fintech and Head of Blockchain and Digital Assets at Linklaters:  “What we know from the face of the Cease and Desist Order is that eToro submitted an Offer of Settlement that the SEC accepted. eToro does not admit or deny the findings set forth in the Cease and Desist Letter, except with respect to the SEC’s jurisdiction.  ""It is important to remember that, unlike in a court case, where allegations must be proven, parties have freedom of contract to agree to settlements. Here, we have very little information about which digital asset or assets the SEC may have alleged were the subject of securities transactions. We also do not have visibility into eToro’s motivations for settling, nor its business plans or strategy generally.  ""For those reasons, in my view, one should exercise caution and should not assume that the existence of the Cease and Desist Order will have an impact on any enforcement action that may be before the courts, now or in the future. Put differently, no allegations were proven in connection with this Cease and Desist Order, and it appears that no allegations were even made by the Commission as to which specific digital assets the Commission thought to be securities or to form part of a securities transaction.”  Bill Hughes, lawyer at Consensys:  Former SEC lawyer Alexandra Damsker:  “What a disappointment to take the settlement.  ""These people are chickens - we have an opening post [the Supreme Court decision] Loper: they should go to the courts and get a determination. The SEC actually DOESN’T have the final say here.  ""But they are just cutting off the business and running off, tail between their legs. Oh well.”  We’ll update this article with more reactions as we receive them.

Salame admitted to lying to the judge about persecutors not making promises to him as part of his plea deal last year.  The judge said he would need time to consider next steps on the matter but told Salame he will have to report to prison on Oct. 11.  A federal judge on Thursday told former FTX executive Ryan Salame that he could be hit with sanctions after Salame lied to the judge about prosecutors not making promises to him as part of his plea deal last year, CNBC reported.  Ryan Salame pled guilty to campaign finance violations as well as running an unlicensed money transmitting business in September 2023, for which he was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison in May.  But in a 32-page memorandum to U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) last week, Salame argued that prosecutors had promised him that they would cease any investigations into Michelle Bond, Salame’s long-time partner and mother of his child, as part of his plea deal.  “You are asking me to let stand a conviction and sentence that I now know is based on false testimony before me in the plea allocution,” Kaplan told Salame on Thursday, claiming repeatedly that the former FTX exec “induced” the Judge to accept his guilty plea.  Prosecutors previously argued that Salame and his lawyers knew that his plea deal wouldn’t resolve any investigations into Bond and that they never made such a promise, formally or informally. Emails shared by the Department of Justice show that prosecutors at least took and shared notes with each other confirming the lack of any such promise.  However, other emails sent by defense attorneys suggest that at the very least, there was a communications breakdown somewhere.  Bond was charged with violating campaign finance laws due to her allegedly taking illegal campaign contributions from Salame and other employees of FTX while running for Congress in 2022. She is facing a maximum of 20 years in prison.  Kaplan on Thursday said that he would need some time to decide how to go about this matter.

33512084,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641563,1726164054,"3 Reason Why Sui and Mpeppe Will Top Gainers Of 2024, Experts Dive Into Why Now Is The Time To Invest","Sui (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) stand out as two of the most promising projects for 2024. Both have captured the attention of crypto experts and investors alike, who believe these tokens will deliver substantial returns in the upcoming year. Here are three key reasons why Sui (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are poised to be the top gainers of 2024, and why now is the perfect time to invest. 1. Strong Market Momentum and Bullish Sentiment for Sui (SUI) Sui (SUI) has made significant strides in 2023, and it is expected to continue its upward trend in 2024. As a Layer-1 blockchain, Sui’s focus on scalability and low transaction costs makes it an attractive option for developers and users seeking efficient decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Over the past few months, Sui (SUI) has consistently ranked among the top-performing cryptocurrencies, with notable price increases and growing interest from institutional and retail investors. Analysts point out that Sui (SUI)’s price has already broken through the crucial $1 resistance level, indicating a bullish outlook for the token. Crypto traders are particularly excited about Sui (SUI) because of its historical ability to perform well during periods when other major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, experience volatility. One notable crypto analyst, Kong, recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) about Sui (SUI)’s potential to climb even higher. He highlighted an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the Sui (SUI) price chart, signaling a bullish reversal. With support levels firmly established around $0.85-$0.90, Sui (SUI) is expected to test the $1.20-$1.50 range soon, with long-term targets reaching as high as $3 in 2024. Given Sui (SUI)’s solid fundamentals, increasing adoption, and growing use cases within the DeFi space, now is the perfect time for investors to consider adding it to their portfolios. 2. Mpeppe’s Explosive Growth Potential and Unique Use Case While Sui (SUI) is garnering attention for its strong market position, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly becoming the new darling of the decentralized gambling space. Known for its innovative approach to online gambling and its potential to revolutionize the industry, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing the interest of investors seeking high-growth opportunities in the crypto space. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has already completed 80% of Stage 4 in its presale, raising millions in a short period. With its target price set at $0.00235, early investors are positioning themselves for potentially massive returns, with some experts predicting gains of up to 150x once the token is fully launched. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart from other meme coins is its strong focus on utility within the gambling sector. The platform allows users to gamble using cryptocurrencies, providing a seamless and secure experience for online gamblers. The decentralized nature of Mpeppe (MPEPE) ensures transparency, low fees, and quick transactions, making it an attractive alternative to traditional online casinos. As the online gambling industry continues to grow, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. With significant backing from the crypto community and a clear roadmap for future development, Mpeppe (MPEPE) could become one of the standout performers of 2024. 3. Expert Predictions and Market Sentiment Both Sui (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have garnered attention from top crypto analysts, who are optimistic about their potential to deliver substantial returns in 2024. The bullish outlook for both tokens is supported by strong technical analysis and market trends, suggesting that now is the ideal time to invest. In the case of Sui (SUI), analysts are particularly excited about the token’s ability to break through key resistance levels and sustain its upward trajectory. With ongoing developments in the DeFi space and the growing popularity of Sui (SUI) among developers, the token is expected to reach new heights in 2024. For Mpeppe (MPEPE), experts point to its unique use case within the gambling industry and its potential to disrupt the market. As more investors recognize the value of decentralized gambling platforms, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is likely to experience significant price appreciation once it enters the broader market. Conclusion As we move into 2024, Sui (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) stand out as two of the most promising cryptocurrencies for investors seeking high-growth opportunities. With Sui (SUI) gaining momentum in the DeFi space and Mpeppe (MPEPE) revolutionizing the online gambling industry, both tokens are well-positioned to deliver substantial returns. Now is the time for investors to take a closer look at these two projects. Whether you’re looking for steady gains with Sui (SUI) or explosive growth potential with Mpeppe (MPEPE), both tokens offer exciting opportunities for 2024 and beyond.

33512081,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641560,1726164050,Sui & Mpeppe: Market Experts Say These Two Crypto Will Give You 200x Gains In 2024,"As the crypto market continues to shift under the weight of Bitcoin’s (BTC) fluctuations, savvy investors are eyeing two exciting opportunities that may deliver massive returns in 2024: Sui (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Both cryptocurrencies are positioned to potentially deliver up to 200x gains, according to market experts who are carefully analyzing the trends. Sui (SUI) Continues to Defy Market Sentiment Amidst the cautious outlook for Bitcoin (BTC), Sui (SUI) is emerging as a top contender, having displayed remarkable bullish momentum in recent weeks. Sui (SUI) has surged over 12% in the last seven days and continues to demonstrate resilience against market odds, even as BTC faces headwinds. Leading crypto analysts, including the well-known Arthur Hayes, have voiced concerns about a potential bearish turn for BTC, with predictions that its price could fall to $50,000. In contrast, Sui (SUI) has garnered positive attention due to its performance and whale activity, solidifying its position as a preferred choice for investors seeking bullish opportunities. One of the key factors behind Sui (SUI)’s recent performance has been the Mysticeti upgrades to the Sui Network, which have sparked excitement within the community. These improvements are expected to enhance Sui’s blockchain capabilities, allowing it to maintain its upward trajectory and challenge major players in the space. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Gains Support as Investors Seek Explosive Returns While Sui (SUI) continues to capture attention, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is also becoming a hot topic among crypto enthusiasts. Known for its focus on decentralized gambling, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has attracted investors looking for significant gains, especially as Sui (SUI) whales begin to back this emerging token. Priced at $0.0021, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has completed over 72% of its presale, and early investors are anticipating a massive 200x return. With its focus on combining meme culture and gambling, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers both viral appeal and real-world utility, making it a unique opportunity for those looking to capitalize on a rapidly growing market. Could Sui (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) Deliver 200x Gains? Both Sui (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are poised to potentially offer massive returns in 2024, making them standouts in an otherwise volatile market. Analysts suggest that Sui (SUI) may rise to $3.60 by the end of Q4 2024, a prediction that has fueled investor optimism. With whales accumulating Sui (SUI) tokens and a growing DeFi ecosystem, the token’s long-term outlook remains positive. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly gaining traction among major investors. As more attention is drawn to its decentralized gambling platform and meme-driven appeal, the token is likely to see significant price growth post-presale. If Mpeppe (MPEPE) follows through on its roadmap, investors could see returns comparable to early-stage meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) or Pepe (PEPE). Conclusion As Arthur Hayes warns of potential downturns for Bitcoin (BTC), investors are turning to alternatives like Sui (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) for high-reward opportunities. With Sui (SUI) demonstrating bullish momentum and Mpeppe (MPEPE) securing whale support, both cryptocurrencies are positioned to provide impressive returns in 2024. Whether you’re looking for the stability of Sui (SUI) or the explosive growth potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE), these two cryptos are ones to watch as the year unfolds.

33512133,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641553,1726164040,Ethereum Still Looking To Bounce Back Whilst New ETH Gambling ICO Positions Itself To Make Millionaires,"Ethereum (ETH), once dubbed the “Swiss Army Knife of Blockchain,” has been an essential player in the decentralized space. Its ability to facilitate smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) without a central authority has cemented its place as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. As Ethereum continues to innovate and evolve, many are wondering what the future holds, particularly in 2025, as predictions swirl around its potential price surge. Meanwhile, a new ETH-based gambling ICO, Mpeppe (MPEPE), has emerged, positioning itself as a possible game-changer for investors seeking massive returns. Ethereum’s Role in 2025: Can It Hit $10,000? Ethereum (ETH) has been a cornerstone in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), but the big question is: can Ethereum (ETH) reach the $10,000 mark by 2025? The predictions are mixed, with some analysts forecasting a range between $6,000 and $10,000, while others remain more conservative, predicting ETH will remain in the $4,000 to $6,500 range. One of the factors driving optimism around Ethereum (ETH) is its commitment to scalability through solutions like sharding, which is expected to increase the network’s efficiency. With the growing adoption of DeFi applications and NFTs, many believe that Ethereum (ETH) will experience a surge in demand, pushing its price higher. However, some analysts remain cautious, pointing to potential regulatory hurdles and the rise of competing blockchain technologies that could affect Ethereum’s market share. Despite these concerns, it’s clear that Ethereum is poised to continue playing a critical role in the decentralized space, providing solid opportunities for investors who can tolerate the inherent volatility. Mpeppe (MPEPE) ICO: A Gamble Worth Taking? While Ethereum (ETH) continues to evolve, the crypto world has seen the rise of new projects looking to capitalize on the growing interest in blockchain-based gambling platforms. One of these projects is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new gambling ICO that’s drawing significant attention from investors. With a current token price of $0.0021 and 72% of its Stage 4 presale completed, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as the next big thing in the gambling crypto space. What makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) stand out is its focus on leveraging Ethereum (ETH)’s network to offer a decentralized casino platform that promises transparency, security, and fairness. As more and more investors flock to the gambling space, Mpeppe (MPEPE) could be the token that redefines the way people bet online. Many ETH whales have already taken notice of the potential for massive returns, especially as Mpeppe’s presale price offers an attractive entry point for those looking to ride the wave of the platform’s success. With the gambling industry set to embrace blockchain technology, Mpeppe (MPEPE) could become a significant player, offering investors the chance to capitalize on its early-stage growth. Uncertainty in the Crypto Market: Ethereum and Mpeppe’s Resilience The cryptocurrency market has seen its fair share of ups and downs, and Ethereum (ETH) is no stranger to volatility. As the market continues to face uncertainty due to regulatory concerns and macroeconomic factors, both Ethereum (ETH) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are proving to be resilient. For Ethereum (ETH), the ability to innovate and adapt to new challenges will be key to its long-term success. Sharding and other scaling solutions are likely to enhance Ethereum (ETH)’s capabilities, attracting more developers and users to the network. Mpeppe (MPEPE), on the other hand, is tapping into a rapidly growing sector—online gambling. The platform’s focus on transparency and decentralization could appeal to users who are skeptical of traditional online casinos, which are often criticized for their lack of fairness. As Ethereum (ETH) provides the foundation for Mpeppe’s platform, both cryptos could benefit from each other’s success. Could Ethereum and Mpeppe Create Millionaires? The potential for both Ethereum (ETH) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) to create wealth for their holders is undeniable. Ethereum (ETH)’s price forecasts suggest it could reach new heights by 2025, with some analysts predicting it could surpass the $10,000 mark. Meanwhile, Mpeppe’s low entry price and high upside potential make it an attractive option for those looking to invest in an ETH-based gambling platform. Investors are advised to keep a close eye on both Ethereum (ETH) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) as the market develops. With Ethereum (ETH) set to continue leading in the DeFi and NFT space, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) ready to disrupt the gambling sector, these two projects offer investors a unique opportunity to get the best of both worlds. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto investor or a newcomer looking for the next big thing, the combination of Ethereum (ETH)’s proven track record and Mpeppe’s promising potential could be the winning formula.

33512079,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641555,1726164009,A Bearish Sentiment Runs Around The ETH Community Mpeppe Becomes Their Profit Haven,"As the cryptocurrency market navigates through uncertain waters, Ethereum (ETH) has been facing a bearish sentiment, with market fluctuations and dwindling confidence among investors. Amid this, a surprising contender, Mpeppe (MPEPE), has emerged as a beacon of hope, drawing investors seeking profits amidst Ethereum’s turbulent phase. The Bearish Turn for Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH), once hailed as the “Swiss Army knife” of the blockchain, has been experiencing significant outflows from its spot ETFs in recent weeks. A wave of sales pressure has plagued the ETH community, causing concern among both retail and institutional investors. In the last few weeks alone, Ethereum ETFs saw outflows of over $562.3 million, reflecting the broader market’s bearish sentiment toward one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies. However, on September 10, 2024, a sign of recovery came as Ethereum (ETH) spot ETFs managed to reverse the trend, recording inflows of $11.4 million. BlackRock and Fidelity, two of the world’s leading investment firms, spearheaded these inflows with contributions of $4.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively. While this has injected some optimism back into the Ethereum (ETH) market, uncertainty still looms large. Ethereum’s (ETH) Future: Optimism Amid Challenges Despite the recent downturn, Ethereum (ETH) remains a vital player in the cryptocurrency landscape, powering decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and NFTs. The introduction of Ethereum Spot ETFs was initially seen as a breakthrough for institutional adoption, and the recent inflows may be the first signs of a longer-term recovery. Some market analysts believe that with the development of Sharding and other scaling solutions, Ethereum (ETH) could once again rise to new highs. Looking ahead, Ethereum’s (ETH) long-term prospects remain strong. Prominent analysts have projected that the token could recover and climb to $4,400 by the end of 2024. Yet, the current volatility has forced some ETH investors to diversify their portfolios to offset losses. And that’s where Mpeppe (MPEPE) comes in as an attractive alternative. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Profitable Safe Haven for ETH Investors While Ethereum (ETH) investors remain cautious, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a profitable opportunity in the market. A new entrant to the decentralized finance space, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an innovative platform combining gambling and decentralized finance, allowing users to earn profits through its native MPEPE token. Priced at $0.0021 during its presale phase, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has already completed 80% of Stage 4, demonstrating significant interest from investors looking for high-growth opportunities. The token’s integration with Ethereum (ETH)’s blockchain has made it an attractive alternative for ETH holders who are seeking exposure to a new and potentially explosive asset while remaining connected to the ETH ecosystem. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s low entry price and strong presale performance have attracted both retail and institutional investors who believe it could be the next big player in the decentralized gambling sector. This surge in interest has created a sense of optimism among those holding Ethereum (ETH), as they now have a hedge against the ongoing bearish trends affecting ETH. Spot ETFs Boost Ethereum (ETH), But Mpeppe Offers Short-Term Gains Ethereum spot ETFs may have shown signs of recovery, but the bearish trends that have plagued ETH for the past few weeks have caused many investors to seek alternative investments. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s entry into the market could be the answer they’ve been looking for. With Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale showing strong growth, ETH holders now have a unique opportunity to invest in a token that could provide substantial returns in the short term. Ethereum’s (ETH) recent inflows into its Spot ETFs signal that the market is starting to regain confidence in the crypto giant. BlackRock and Fidelity have been instrumental in this turnaround, adding millions in ETH investments through their respective funds. However, the pressure is still on Ethereum (ETH) to sustain these inflows and ensure that the positive trend continues. For Mpeppe (MPEPE), the future looks even brighter. As Ethereum (ETH) continues to work through its bearish phase, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s growing community and successful presale suggest that it could offer investors the short-term profits they’ve been seeking. Ethereum and Mpeppe: A Strategic Combination The combination of Ethereum (ETH)’s long-term potential and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s short-term growth opportunities presents an ideal strategy for investors. As Ethereum (ETH) continues to recover, its success will likely spill over to projects built on its network, like Mpeppe (MPEPE). With Ethereum’s price forecast showing potential highs of $4,400, those who hold both ETH and MPEPE tokens could benefit from the best of both worlds: the stability of Ethereum (ETH)’s infrastructure and the explosive growth potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE). While Ethereum’s (ETH) community remains hopeful for a sustained recovery, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique and profitable alternative in the current market. By leveraging the growing interest in decentralized gambling and integrating seamlessly with Ethereum’s blockchain, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is becoming a safe haven for those seeking to navigate the uncertain landscape of cryptocurrency.

33512075,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641558,1726164002,Sui’s Bullish Pattern Starts To Fade Away Investors Seek Explosive Gains Form Mpeppe,"The recent price action surrounding Sui (SUI) has attracted attention in the cryptocurrency market, particularly as it smashed through the psychological barrier of $1. However, as the bullish momentum begins to cool down, investors are turning their attention towards emerging tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE), which promises potential explosive gains. Sui (SUI) Price Breaks $1: Can the Bulls Continue? Over the past week, Sui (SUI) maintained a bullish trend despite volatility in the broader crypto market caused by Bitcoin and Ethereum fluctuations. Sui (SUI) was one of the standout performers with a 15% rise, leading the token to breach the crucial $1 mark, sparking hopes among investors of further rallies. As the market sentiment surrounding Sui (SUI) improved, key analysts and institutions began to show increased optimism. Notably, the crypto analyst BMOON predicts that Sui (SUI) could reach $3.65 during its current bull cycle, offering a promising short-term outlook. Grayscale’s involvement has also added a layer of credibility to Sui (SUI), as the institutional investor launched a new trust, aiming to attract investors interested in third-generation blockchain technology. This trust is designed to enhance Sui (SUI)’s scalability and reduce transaction costs, features that have bolstered its position in the market. Technically, Sui (SUI) remains in a bullish pattern, supported by a 36.25% price jump over the past 10 days. The recovery momentum has led Sui (SUI) to challenge the 50% Fibonacci resistance at $1.0541, but it still faces significant hurdles at $1.23 and $1.55. If the momentum sustains, BMOON’s projection of Sui (SUI) reaching $3.65 could materialize, though it requires breaking through these resistance levels. Why Investors Are Eyeing Mpeppe (MPEPE) for Explosive Gains While Sui (SUI) continues to attract attention, many investors are shifting their focus towards Mpeppe (MPEPE), a fast-rising meme coin in the cryptocurrency world. As Sui (SUI) experiences its own battles with resistance levels, Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out with its low entry price and unique value proposition. With the token priced at $0.0021, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has already completed 72% of its presale and shows all the hallmarks of a project poised for rapid growth. The gambling-focused ecosystem that Mpeppe is building has sparked interest from major crypto whales who believe it could provide returns of up to 150x. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has garnered attention for its innovative combination of meme coin appeal with real-world use cases in decentralized gambling. Investors have been flocking to the presale, enticed by both the low price and the strong growth potential, as Mpeppe aims to carve out a niche in the booming gambling sector of the crypto industry. Is Mpeppe (MPEPE) the Next Big Opportunity? The current performance of Sui (SUI), with its potential to hit $3.65, remains promising for those focused on short-term gains. However, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioned as a high-growth token with the potential for extraordinary returns, especially for investors willing to ride out the early stages of its launch. While Sui (SUI) focuses on third-generation blockchain scalability, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is targeting a completely different market—combining the viral appeal of meme coins with a decentralized gambling ecosystem. This unique positioning allows it to offer investors access to a sector that has seen significant demand and promises substantial profits. With 72% of its presale completed and investor enthusiasm growing, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a serious contender for those looking to diversify their portfolios with high-potential altcoins. Conclusion: Sui (SUI) or Mpeppe (MPEPE)? Both Sui (SUI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer exciting opportunities, but they cater to different types of investors. Sui (SUI) offers a more traditional play with its bullish technical indicators and solid third-generation blockchain technology, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) appeals to risk-takers looking for the next meme-coin explosion. As Sui (SUI) faces critical resistance levels on its path to $3.65, the momentum for Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to build, positioning it as one of the most exciting tokens in the presale market. For investors seeking explosive growth, Mpeppe (MPEPE) may offer the chance to get in early before its full potential is realized.

33510596,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641489,1726160442,Bullish On Helium? Explore Why Whales Has Migrated To GoodEgg’s (GEGG) Presale Token,"Helium (HNT) has long been a favorite in the Internet of Things (IoT) and decentralized wireless communication spaces, delivering impressive returns with its innovative approach to blockchain and IoT convergence. However, recent whale activity has shown a shift toward a new presale token, GoodEgg (GEGG), which has caught the attention of big-money investors. But why are Helium whales making the jump? Let’s dive into the details. Helium (HNT) Soars Amid IoT Hype Helium (HNT) has recently enjoyed a notable price surge, climbing over 20% this week. This rally was sparked by rumors regarding new monetization models for IoT devices, allowing everyday household appliances to mine cryptocurrency. Helium (HNT), which leads the charge in decentralized IoT networks, saw renewed investor interest as the idea of widespread device monetization reignited excitement around the token. While Helium (HNT)’s price is still 80% below its 2021 all-time highs, the upward trajectory shows that IoT tokens like Helium (HNT) are far from forgotten. With more devices being connected to the Helium (HNT) network daily, the demand for HNT tokens is expected to rise, particularly as the network expands into untapped sectors. Yet, despite this rally, whales have begun looking beyond HNT, setting their sights on a new presale star: GoodEgg (GEGG). Why GoodEgg (GEGG) Is Luring In Helium Whales GoodEgg (GEGG) is unlike the typical meme coins that pop up in the crypto space. Its unique hybrid model, combining meme coin appeal with practical utility powered by AI, has created a presale frenzy. GEGG’s AI-driven social scoring system is transforming how users and businesses interact on digital platforms, offering deep insights into social influence and behavior patterns. As a result, GoodEgg (GEGG) has gained traction as more than just a speculative meme coin — it has utility, a solid technological foundation, and the potential for long-term growth. This has drawn the attention of major investors who see the presale as an opportunity to get in early on what could be the next big player in the cryptocurrency space. Helium (HNT) whales, already familiar with long-term projects that involve decentralized infrastructure and tech innovation, are now flocking to GoodEgg (GEGG)’s presale. The AI-powered ecosystem offers a new avenue for growth and diversification, especially as the meme coin market continues to evolve and mature. Helium’s Continued Strength and Challenges While Helium (HNT) remains strong, it faces challenges in sustaining its bullish momentum. The price recently hit a resistance level around $8.3, with technical indicators showing potential short-term pullbacks. The token burn mechanism, driven by the network’s data usage, continues to create deflationary pressure that supports the price, but broader market conditions could still influence HNT’s performance. Helium (HNT)’s core strength lies in its expanding IoT network and the increasing adoption of its decentralized infrastructure. The growth of connected devices and data services ensures that HNT remains a key player in the IoT ecosystem. However, with competition on the rise and the market for decentralized wireless solutions becoming more saturated, investors are exploring diversification options — which is where GoodEgg (GEGG) comes in. GoodEgg’s Explosive Growth Potential GoodEgg (GEGG) is in the midst of a 180% rally, and analysts are predicting even greater growth once the token officially launches. The presale has drawn significant attention from investors looking to capitalize on the AI-driven social scoring system that has practical applications across various industries. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely on hype alone, GoodEgg (GEGG) combines the viral appeal of memes with genuine utility. This combination makes it an attractive option for investors, particularly those who are already familiar with long-term technological investments, such as Helium (HNT) whales. GoodEgg (GEGG)’s presale success is a testament to its potential, with investors rushing to secure their tokens before the price climbs further. The AI-powered ecosystem is positioned to revolutionize how social data is analyzed and utilized, offering businesses and individuals a unique tool for understanding social interactions and trends. The Future of Helium and GoodEgg Both Helium (HNT) and GoodEgg (GEGG) offer compelling investment opportunities, but they cater to different aspects of the crypto market. Helium (HNT)’s focus on decentralized IoT networks and its expanding ecosystem make it a solid long-term investment for those interested in infrastructure and connectivity. However, its reliance on external market conditions and potential resistance levels means that it could face challenges in maintaining its current momentum. GoodEgg (GEGG), on the other hand, taps into the explosive potential of meme coins while offering real-world utility through its AI-driven platform. This hybrid approach positions GoodEgg (GEGG) as a standout in the meme coin market, attracting both speculative investors and those looking for utility-based tokens. For Helium (HNT) whales, the shift to GoodEgg (GEGG) represents a strategic move to diversify their portfolios while still investing in innovative technology. As GoodEgg (GEGG) continues its presale rally and prepares for its official launch, it’s clear that this token has the potential to dominate both the utility and meme coin markets in the near future. Conclusion: A Winning Combination Helium (HNT) has long been a staple in the IoT and decentralized infrastructure sectors, and its recent price surge shows that the token still has plenty of life left. However, the emergence of GoodEgg (GEGG) as a hybrid meme coin with real-world applications has created a new opportunity for investors. The migration of Helium whales to GoodEgg (GEGG)’s presale is a clear sign that major players are betting on the future of AI-driven tokens. With GoodEgg (GEGG)’s combination of meme coin appeal and practical utility, it’s no surprise that this presale is drawing attention from across the crypto space. As both Helium and GoodEgg (GEGG) continue to evolve, they offer unique opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on technological innovation and market trends.

Simultaneously, GoodEgg’s (GEGG) “Play-2-Date” presale has completed 80% of its first stage, attracting attention from investors seeking the next big opportunity in the crypto world. Injective (INJ) Makes Waves with BlackRock BUIDL Index Launch Injective (INJ) has been in the spotlight due to its collaboration with BlackRock’s BUIDL fund. The recent launch of the BlackRock BUIDL Index has opened up new avenues for both institutional and retail investors to access tokenized financial assets. The BUIDL Index allows users to participate in decentralized on-chain finance instruments, marking a significant advancement in the asset-tokenization space. This innovative move by Injective (INJ) has led to a notable 14% price surge shortly after the index’s launch. Currently, Injective (INJ) is trading at around $17.18, reflecting strong market sentiment. The index offers traders the ability to engage with on-chain financial instruments that track the performance of BlackRock’s fund, introducing greater transparency to fund movements and providing valuable insights into institutional crypto involvement. Eric Chen, CEO of Injective Labs, emphasized the importance of democratizing access to tokenized assets. With the BUIDL Index, investors can now enter the market with as little as one dollar, making institutional-grade assets accessible to a broader audience. This milestone highlights Injective’s (INJ) commitment to innovation and further solidifies its position in the tokenization sector. Why Investors Are Flocking to GoodEgg’s (GEGG) ‘Play-2-Date’ Presale While Injective (INJ) is enjoying its moment in the sun, another crypto project is quietly dominating the presale landscape: GoodEgg (GEGG). GoodEgg’s “Play-2-Date” presale, currently in its first stage, has already achieved 80% completion. This remarkable progress signals strong investor interest in GoodEgg’s unique blend of gaming and AI-powered social scoring. GoodEgg (GEGG) stands out in the market by offering an innovative platform that allows users to engage with “Play-2-Date” functionalities, providing rewards based on social interaction and performance. The platform uses AI to generate personalized experiences and metrics, creating a new layer of engagement for both players and the broader community. The concept behind GoodEgg’s “Play-2-Date” is designed to resonate with users who want to earn rewards based on their social influence, giving them more than just a gaming experience — they also get to participate in the shaping of the digital ecosystem. This exciting use case, coupled with the presale success, makes GoodEgg (GEGG) one of the most promising new tokens on the horizon. Injective (INJ) and GoodEgg (GEGG): Driving Innovation in Different Sectors Injective (INJ) and GoodEgg (GEGG) may be addressing different sectors of the cryptocurrency market, but both are making headlines for their respective innovations. While Injective (INJ) is focused on revolutionizing institutional access to decentralized finance through tokenization, GoodEgg (GEGG) is building a robust platform that merges AI, social interaction, and gaming. The success of the Injective (INJ) token’s price surge reflects confidence in its ability to deliver long-term value through partnerships with institutions like BlackRock. Meanwhile, the rapid progress of GoodEgg’s (GEGG) presale underscores the demand for fresh, innovative concepts that offer users more than just speculative potential. As Injective (INJ) continues to climb, its 5.93% rise this week is evidence of the community’s confidence in its future growth. Similarly, the GoodEgg (GEGG) presale success is proof that the market is ready for a token that combines utility and entertainment, further pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the crypto space. Final Thoughts: Both Tokens Positioned for Success Injective’s (INJ) continued success in the tokenization space, supported by its recent collaboration with BlackRock, is poised to create new opportunities for both institutional and retail investors. The innovation behind the BUIDL Index demonstrates the power of blockchain technology in democratizing access to high-value assets. Meanwhile, GoodEgg (GEGG) is rapidly emerging as a major player in the meme and utility coin market, with its presale nearing completion. The “Play-2-Date” concept is a groundbreaking approach that will undoubtedly appeal to both gamers and investors looking for tokens with real-world applications. As these two tokens make waves in the crypto world, investors should keep an eye on both Injective (INJ) and GoodEgg (GEGG) as they continue to lead the charge in their respective sectors.

If you missed out on Injective’s price surge, now might be the perfect time to look at GoodEgg (GEGG), a hybrid meme coin projected to deliver up to 13,000% returns. Injective (INJ) Partners with Mercuryo to Simplify User Onboarding One of the reasons behind Injective’s recent surge was its strategic partnership with Mercuryo, a provider of fiat on-ramp payment solutions. This partnership aims to simplify the user onboarding process, making it easier for new users to purchase digital assets directly using their local currencies. Traditionally, purchasing cryptocurrencies involves complex steps like acquiring Bitcoin or Ethereum before converting them into other digital assets. Injective (INJ), in collaboration with Mercuryo, now allows users to bypass these cumbersome processes and purchase digital assets directly through credit and debit cards. This innovative partnership reflects Injective (INJ)’s commitment to making decentralized finance (DeFi) more accessible to people worldwide, democratizing access to blockchain technology. The user-friendly on-ramp is expected to bring more participants into the Injective (INJ) ecosystem, increasing adoption and long-term value for its native token, INJ. The Rise of GoodEgg (GEGG) in the Meme Coin Space While Injective (INJ) is revolutionizing DeFi, GoodEgg (GEGG) is emerging as a force to be reckoned with in the meme coin sector.

Unlike traditional meme coins, which rely solely on hype, GEGG offers real-world utility through its social scoring mechanism, making it more than just a speculative investment. What’s Driving Injective’s (INJ) Growth? Injective (INJ)’s partnership with Mercuryo is just one of the many factors contributing to its recent rally. The platform has also completed a major upgrade to its blockchain infrastructure, enhancing performance and security for users. With these improvements, Injective (INJ) is positioning itself as a leader in the DeFi space, capable of supporting a growing user base while delivering high-quality services. In addition to the technical upgrades, Injective (INJ) has been actively engaging with the broader blockchain community, attending conferences and showcasing its innovations. These efforts have boosted the platform’s visibility, further driving interest in its native token. According to crypto analysts, INJ is showing bullish signals, with a falling wedge pattern on the charts suggesting a potential 214% rally. With over 67.32% of holders waiting for a breakout, Injective (INJ)’s price momentum is likely to continue in the near future. Why GoodEgg (GEGG) Might Be the Next Big Thing As investors look for the next big opportunity, GoodEgg (GEGG) is rapidly becoming a top contender. The hybrid nature of the project, combining meme coin elements with a functional social scoring system, makes it an attractive option for those seeking both fun and financial gains. The ongoing presale of GEGG has already completed 80% of Stage 1, signaling strong investor confidence in the project. With its unique approach, GoodEgg (GEGG) is positioned to challenge established meme coins and potentially become one of the leading tokens in the space. For those who missed out on Injective (INJ)’s rally, GoodEgg presents an exciting alternative with massive upside potential. Final Thoughts Both Injective (INJ) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are shaping the future of blockchain in their respective niches.

33510589,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641433,1726160424,"Shiba Inu Accumulation: Whales Pull Out $4 Million From Exchanges, Can SHIB Recover?","Popular meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a relatively calm period of on-chain activity in recent weeks. This calm pace has been mirrored in the token’s price action, which has remained largely stable without any major fluctuations. However, despite this apparent lull, a trend of significant SHIB outflows across various crypto exchanges has emerged this week. According to on-chain data, 307 billion SHIB tokens were withdrawn in the past 24 hours. This mass withdrawal seems to raise curiosity, especially since this was not an isolated event. Interestingly, this data peaked at 2.179 trillion SHIB earlier in the week. Whales Pull Out Millions Worth Of SHIB From Exchanges Data from CryptoQuant shows that more than 309 billion SHIB tokens were taken out of aggregated crypto exchanges on September 11. Taking into account the current price of SHIB, it amounts to over $4 million. Furthermore, the data showed that a similar amount was withdrawn from crypto exchanges on September 10. A withdrawal peak was registered on September 9, a day which was highlighted with 2.179 trillion SHIB tokens being withdrawn from crypto exchanges. At the time of withdrawal, the tokens were worth approximately $29.5 million. Related Reading: End Of The Road For NEIRO? Crypto Analyst Predicts Breakdown Below $0.13 The notable increase in transactions is supported by similar data from IntoTheBlock (ITB). Interestingly, this one sheds light on activity predominantly driven by so-called “whales,” or large holders of the cryptocurrency. ITB’s data highlights that over the past seven days, the volume of transactions whose value exceeds $100,000 has surged to a total of $143.68 million. While this might not be as much during a strong bull rally, it represents an increase of almost 60% from the previous seven-day timeframe. Such a marked increase suggests that large holders are starting to take advantage of the lower prices to buy the dip. Is A Shiba Inu Rally Brewing? This sharp increase in outflows is likely to catch the attention of SHIB investors. The implications could point to renewed confidence in SHIB, and a bullish trend could emerge soon. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Retesting $57,000 Is Good For The Price Since the beginning of September, SHIB has struggled to break above the $0.000014 mark due to bearish pressure in the broader crypto markets. However, bullish supporters have been largely successful in minimizing losses and have consistently defended the $0.000010 support level throughout the month. As of the latest update, Shiba Inu has seen a slight price increase alongside many other cryptocurrencies over the past 24 hours. SHIB is currently trading at $0.00001343, reflecting a 1.5% rise. The price is expected to rise further if the trend of strong SHIB outflows from exchanges continues. Similarly, a sustained move above $0.000014 could push SHIB past its August high of $0.00001607 in the short term.

33510587,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641497,1726160417,Near Protocol Price Prediction September 2024: GoodEgg Presale Surpasses NEAR 10X,"The cryptocurrency market has been showing mixed signals this September, with various tokens, including NEAR Protocol (NEAR), experiencing both volatility and signs of recovery. NEAR Protocol (NEAR), a favorite among developers and investors for its scalable and efficient blockchain network, has struggled to break key resistance levels but continues to maintain a strong community backing. Meanwhile, GoodEgg (GEGG), the AI-driven meme coin, has surpassed expectations, delivering returns that have already outperformed NEAR Protocol (NEAR) by 10X during its presale phase. Investors have quickly taken note of GoodEgg (GEGG) as a high-potential project, particularly due to its Play-2-Date platform, which merges social scoring with meme culture in an AI-powered environment. With GoodEgg (GEGG) priced at $0.00015, its rapid appreciation has far outpaced NEAR’s growth trajectory in the short term, making it an attractive choice for risk-tolerant investors. NEAR Protocol Struggles for a Breakthrough In the past 24 hours, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) has dipped by 3.5%, failing to sustain its upward momentum from earlier in the month. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) price bounced off a critical support level below $3.90 but remains challenged by bearish sentiment in the market. Investors are eagerly watching for a breakout above $5, which could potentially open the door to a bullish continuation towards $8.8, marking a significant recovery from recent lows. In contrast, GoodEgg (GEGG) continues to ride its presale success, with demand for the token growing each day. The GoodEgg presale has captured attention from early investors looking for massive returns, as GEGG’s utility within the AI social scoring ecosystem is proving to be a groundbreaking concept. Unlike NEAR Protocol (NEAR), which is focusing on decentralized applications (dApps) and infrastructure, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a mix of meme coin dynamics with a unique AI use case, drawing attention from investors who seek short-term gains coupled with long-term potential. Inflation Data and Market Pressure NEAR Protocol (NEAR), alongside other cryptocurrencies, has been influenced by broader market trends. As the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data is set to release, inflation concerns have kept NEAR Protocol (NEAR) and many other tokens under pressure. The anticipation around the Federal Reserve’s next interest rate policy decision has also played a role in the subdued market movement. Despite this, the NEAR Protocol (NEAR) blockchain continues to attract new developers and projects, providing a foundation for future growth. However, for September, the challenge remains in overcoming key resistance levels and shaking off bearish trends. GoodEgg (GEGG) Outperforms NEAR While NEAR Protocol (NEAR) has seen moderate fluctuations, the presale of GoodEgg (GEGG), an AI-powered social scoring meme coin, has been making waves across the market. GoodEgg has surpassed expectations with a 10X increase in presale performance, positioning itself as a frontrunner in the upcoming meme coin sector. GoodEgg (GEGG) combines the appeal of meme coins with the utility of artificial intelligence, offering an innovative “Play-2-Date” platform that has captivated the crypto community. Its unique approach to social scoring through decentralized AI technologies has attracted both retail and institutional investors. This surge in interest has allowed GoodEgg to eclipse well-established tokens like NEAR Protocol (NEAR) in terms of percentage gains. What’s Next for NEAR and GoodEgg? As NEAR Protocol (NEAR) continues to fight for its place above the $5 resistance, all eyes will be on how the broader crypto market reacts to upcoming U.S. inflation data and global economic conditions. For now, NEAR remains a solid long-term investment, with many developers still flocking to its robust ecosystem. On the other hand, GoodEgg (GEGG) is quickly becoming one of the hottest presale tokens of 2024, with its projected 10X gains driving widespread FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) among investors. As the presale moves closer to completion, the potential for further growth only seems to increase, making it a must-watch in the final quarter of the year. Both NEAR Protocol (NEAR) and GoodEgg (GEGG) offer compelling opportunities, but as of September 2024, it is clear that the hype surrounding GoodEgg (GEGG) has given it a substantial edge in terms of short-term performance.

However, as the market continues to diversify, seasoned investors are now looking at the next big opportunity and that opportunity might just be GoodEgg (GEGG), a new “Play-2-Date” meme coin with the potential to soar 1000x. Injective (INJ): A DeFi Powerhouse Injective Protocol (INJ) is known for its powerful decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that enables cross-chain derivatives trading, futures, and options across multiple blockchains. Over the past year, Injective (INJ) has developed a strong user base and robust infrastructure, which has positioned it as a leader in the DeFi space. With major partnerships like its recent collaboration with Mercuryo, Injective (INJ) is simplifying the user onboarding process and making DeFi more accessible to a broader audience. INJ’s price has seen considerable upward momentum in recent months, with analysts predicting even higher growth if market conditions remain favorable. However, while INJ continues to dominate the DeFi market, some of its investors are diversifying into the emerging sector of meme coins, seeking higher returns through projects like GoodEgg (GEGG). GoodEgg (GEGG): A Meme Coin Revolution GoodEgg (GEGG) is a new entrant in the cryptocurrency world, but it’s already making waves. The “Play-2-Date” meme coin has captured the imagination of crypto enthusiasts with its gamified approach to social interaction and rewards. By participating in GEGG’s ecosystem, users can earn rewards and boost their social scoring, adding a unique layer of engagement that has drawn comparisons to successful meme projects like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Valued at just $0.00015, GoodEgg (GEGG) is in its early stages but has already seen significant traction, with investors eyeing the potential for 1000x returns. The presale has already sold out a considerable portion of its first stage, further indicating growing interest in the project. Why INJ Investors Are Joining the GEGG Revolution Investors in Injective Protocol (INJ) are no strangers to innovation. Many who have benefited from INJ’s rise as a DeFi powerhouse are now diversifying into the meme coin space, attracted by the massive potential gains that GoodEgg (GEGG) offers. While Injective (INJ) is known for its technical prowess and strong infrastructure, GoodEgg (GEGG) appeals to the speculative side of the market, where the potential for explosive growth in a short period of time is immense. For these investors, GoodEgg (GEGG)’s low entry point of $0.00015 offers an opportunity to get in early on what could be the next meme coin sensation. The promise of 1000x returns is hard to ignore, especially for those who missed out on early gains in Dogecoin or Shiba Inu. The Meme Coin Advantage: GEGG’s Edge What sets GoodEgg (GEGG) apart from other meme coins is its innovative “Play-2-Date” system, which rewards users for engagement and participation in its ecosystem. This added utility is rare in the meme coin market, where most tokens rely solely on hype and community support. By integrating real-world engagement metrics, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a compelling case for both short-term traders and long-term holders. Moreover, the GoodEgg (GEGG) community is rapidly growing, and as with any meme coin, a strong community can drive significant price action. The combination of entertainment, utility, and viral potential makes GEGG one of the most exciting projects to watch in 2024. Injective vs. GoodEgg: What’s the Better Investment? For investors, the choice between Injective (INJ) and GoodEgg (GEGG) comes down to risk tolerance and investment goals. Injective (INJ) is a proven DeFi platform with a long-term growth trajectory. Its established partnerships and expanding ecosystem make it a solid choice for those looking to capitalize on the growth of decentralized finance. On the other hand, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers the potential for massive short-term gains, particularly for those who can get in early. While meme coins are notoriously volatile, they can also offer incredible returns something that’s evident from the success stories of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. For INJ investors looking to diversify their portfolios, GoodEgg (GEGG) presents an exciting, albeit speculative, opportunity. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Both INJ and GEGG Both Injective Protocol (INJ) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are set for significant growth in the coming months, albeit for different reasons. Injective’s technical innovations and partnerships position it as a leader in the DeFi sector, while GoodEgg’s (GEGG) unique “Play-2-Date” concept and low entry price make it a compelling choice for those seeking high-reward opportunities. As the crypto market continues to evolve, having a diversified portfolio that includes both established DeFi projects like Injective (INJ) and emerging meme coins like GoodEgg (GEGG) could be the key to maximizing returns in 2024 and beyond.

42417249,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXkGz,1726160386,Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Amps Up Pressure on Layer-2 Networks to Decentralize Further,"There's the bully pulpit. And then the silent treatment.  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote on X that he will be weighing in on layer 2 networks differently in his public posts from now on – omitting mentions of those projects that aren't decentralized enough.  To merit any ink, they have to at least meet a decentralization threshold known as ""Stage 1,"" under a hierarchy he laid out years ago in a blog post.  “Starting next year, I plan to only publicly mention (in blogs, talks, etc) L2s that are stage 1+,” Buterin wrote. “It doesn't matter if I invested, or if you're my friend; stage 1 or bust.”  In 2022, Buterin proposed a set of stages for rollups, to classify them in their pursuit of decentralization. The criteria is meant to showcase that rollups tend to rely on “training wheels” and deploy their protocols to users before it's ready to fully decentralize.  “While a project’s tech is still immature, the project launches early anyway to allow the ecosystem to start forming, but instead of relying fully on its fraud proofs or ZK proofs, there is some kind of multisig that has the ability to force a particular outcome in case there are bugs in the code,” Buterin wrote in a blog post in 2022.  In blockchain terms, multisig is short for a key that can be controlled by combining multiple signatures – often representing a small group of people who could make changes under emergency conditions, essentially bypassing the typical consensus process used to validate the network.  Taking off the 'training wheels'  Buterin has categorized the projects in three different stages, ranging from 0 to 2. Stage 0 is when a layer 2 network relies on full training wheels. Stage 1 is when it has limited training wheels, but is running with fraud proofs – an important cryptographic process that avoids the need for a single centralized entity to settle any layer-2 transactions to the base Ethereum blockchain. Stage 2 means a project is fully decentralized.  L2Beat, a layer-2 dashboard, tracks how the different layer-2 protocols rank in terms of those different stages. Currently, none of the leading rollups has reached Stage 2.  At Stage 1, only Arbitrum One, OP Mainnet, and zkSync lite have reached this stage.  “The era of rollups being glorified multisigs is coming to an end,"" Buterin wrote on X.

Based on a survey of more than 2,500 cryptocurrency users in Brazil, Nigeria, Turkey, Indonesia, and India, access to crypto markets was still the leading motivation for using stablecoins, but there's a wide variety of popular non-digital asset use cases as well.  Read more: India and Nigeria Lead the World in Crypto Adoption Again, but Indonesia Is Fastest Growing: Chainalysis  Some 69% of the respondents said they have converted their local currency to stablecoins, 39% said they have purchased goods or services with tokens and have sent money to a relative in another country, 30% have used stables for their business and 23% have paid or received a salary in stables, the survey found.  Sampled users said that they prefer using stablecoins on blockchains instead of U.S. dollar banking because of greater efficiency, the potential to earn yield and lower chances of government interference.  Users of Tether {{USDT}}, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization and anecdotally the most popular stablecoin in emerging regions, said they use the token due to its network effects, user trust, liquidity and its track record relative to other stablecoins.  Most respondents named Ethereum {{ETH}} as their preferred blockchain rail for stablecoin transactions, followed by Binance Smart Chain {{BNB}}, Solana {{SOL}} and Tron {{TRX}}.  ""We felt there was a lack of data around how folks are actually using stablecoins around the world, especially in emerging markets,"" Nic Carter, general partner at Castle Island, said in an email to CoinDesk.  ""What we found validated our beliefs about stablecoins: they are being used not just for crypto trading, but increasingly feature in the ordinary economic lives of these individuals,"" Carter noted in an X post.  Stablecoins are a $160 billion asset class within crypto, with their prices anchored to an external asset, predominantly to the U.S. dollar.

The New York-based company's ""which party will win the Senate?"" and ""which party will win the House?"" contracts went live on its website Thursday, shortly after a federal judge rejected the CFTC's last-minute bid for a two-week stay of the court’s earlier decision to allow the contracts.  ""Today markets the first trade made on regulated election markets in nearly a century,"" Tarek Mansour, Kalshi's co-founder and CEO, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson.  Latest news: Kalshi's New Political Prediction Markets Halted as CFTC Appeals Loss  The telephonic hearing took place shortly after U.S. District Court Judge Jia M. Cobb, the judge overseeing Kalshi’s case against the CFTC, issued her full opinion explaining her rationale for granting the prediction market’s motion for summary judgment last Friday.  A CFTC lawyer said during the hearing that the regulator plans to appeal the case brought by the trading platform, and even though Judge Cobb denied the agency's motion for a stay, it could still ask the higher court to stop the firm from listing the contracts while the appeal is pending.  Read more: CFTC Has No Authority to Second-Guess Election Contracts, Judge Says  Kalshi filed suit against the CFTC last November, after the regulator attempted to block the prediction market from listing contracts betting on whether Democrats or Republicans would control each house of Congress after the 2024 election. Cobb ruled Thursday that the CFTC had “exceeded its statutory authority” in trying to ban election betting.  As soon as Cobb’s ruling hit the docket last Friday, lawyers for the CFTC filed an emergency motion essentially asking the judge to reconsider staying her order for at least two weeks while the regulator appealed her decision to a higher court. The CFTC’s lawyers argued that Kalshi’s election markets contracts are “susceptible to manipulation” and could shake Americans’ faith in election integrity.  “The election gambling contracts pose significant public interest risk,” the CFTC’s lead attorney said during Thursday's hearing. “The Commission noted serious concerns about potential adverse effects on election integrity, or the perception of election integrity, at a time where confidence in election integrity is incredibly low. These contracts would give market participants a $100 million incentive to influence either the market or the election, which could very certainly undermine confidence in election integrity. This is a very serious public interest threat.”  While Cobb said that she was not unsympathetic to the regulator’s concerns in general, there would need to be definitive evidence of “both certain and great” irreparable harm in order to convince her to issue a stay – not just the nebulous possibility of future harm.  Read more: U.S. Election Betting: What's at Stake in Final (?) CFTC-Kalshi Showdown  Rather than giving a concrete example of the harm caused by Kalshi’s contracts, the CFTC’s lawyer argued that “the Commission is not required to suffer the flood before building a dam.”  Yaakov Roth of Jones Day, the lead attorney for Kalshi, argued that any delay in the company being able to list the elections contracts was causing economic harm to Kalshi – and furthermore, driving business to unregulated competitors, not least of all crypto-based Polymarket, which despite being barred from doing business in the U.S. has seen gangbusters volume.  “Whether the agency or the court or anyone else thinks that contracts are good or bad for public interest, they are already happening,” Roth said.  “At the end of the day, the court concluded that we're legally entitled to list these contracts,"" he said. ""Staying that judgment would wipe out [Kalshi's] investment, while allowing the same trading activity to continue outside the confines of any CFTC regulation. That would amount to punishing the one party that is trying to play by the rules.”  Read more:U.S. Election Betting Delay Would Be 'Devastating' to Kalshi, Firm Says  Caroline Pham, one of the CFTC's five commissioners, called the agency's defeat self-inflicted.  ""The Court's opinion in Kalshi echoes the concerns I raised more than two years ago when the CFTC first embarked on a creative reading of its own rules and governing statutes in this matter,"" she said. ""Oftentimes, the simplest explanation for what a law means is the correct one. The Commission would do well to learn from this experience and respect the limitations of its authority.""  Better Markets, a lobbying group that advocates robust regulation of financial markets, called the decision an example of the ""harmful effects"" of the Supreme Court's Loper decision, which ended a longstanding requirement for courts to defer to agencies' interpretation of the law.  ""Had that requirement been in place here, perhaps the CFTC would still be empowered to protect the public from dangerous contracts like Kalshi's,"" the group said. ""Moreover, although the Supreme Court in Loper Bright specifically allowed courts to still weigh the technical expertise and experience of agencies in interpreting a statute, the judge explicitly refused to do so here.""

33509241,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641538,1726156843,Add Uniwasp and New Gambling Coin At $0.0021 To Get The Best Of Both Worlds,"As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, savvy investors are looking to diversify their portfolios with both established assets like Uniswap (UNI) and emerging opportunities such as Mpeppe (MPEPE). While Uniswap has been a mainstay in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, Mpeppe is making waves in the meme coin and gambling space, offering a fresh way to combine fun with financial potential. Here’s why adding both tokens to your investment strategy could give you the best of both worlds. Uniswap’s Steady Climb Continues Over the past 24 hours, Uniswap (UNI) has risen by 3.12%, reaching a price of $6.94. This continues an upward trend for the token, which has seen an 8% gain over the past week. Uniswap (UNI)’s price has been on a positive trajectory, moving from $6.43 to its current level. Despite fluctuations in the broader crypto market, Uniswap (UNI) has maintained a steady course, showing resilience in the face of market volatility. While Uniswap (UNI) reached its all-time high of $44.92 in May 2021, it has since experienced corrections. However, the recent price movement suggests that it could be gearing up for another breakout. With Uniswap (UNI) holding strong support levels and showing potential for further gains, it remains a solid investment for those looking to capitalize on the growth of decentralized exchanges. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Gambling Coin With Major Potential On the other end of the spectrum, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is an exciting new entry in the meme coin space, currently priced at just $0.0021. What makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) stand out is its unique blend of meme culture and the gambling sector. The project is designed as a Play-to-Earn (P2E) gambling coin, offering users the opportunity to participate in decentralized casino games while earning real rewards. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues its presale, investors are flocking to the token, eager to get in before its price surges. With 80% of its presale completed, the community around Mpeppe (MPEPE) is growing rapidly, attracting both retail investors and crypto whales alike. The token’s unique use case in the gambling space gives it a strong foundation for future growth, particularly as the demand for P2E platforms continues to rise. Uniswap vs. Mpeppe: Why Not Both? While Uniswap (UNI) is a well-established player in the DeFi space, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a high-risk, high-reward opportunity in the emerging gambling and meme coin markets. By investing in both, you can benefit from the stability and long-term potential of Uniswap (UNI) while also tapping into the explosive growth prospects of Mpeppe (MPEPE). Uniswap (UNI)’s robust ecosystem and consistent performance make it a reliable choice for investors who want exposure to the DeFi sector. Its decentralized exchange platform continues to attract users, and with transaction volumes surging past 300 million in 2024, Uniswap (UNI) shows no signs of slowing down. As the DeFi market expands, Uniswap (UNI) remains a key player, making it a must-have for any diversified crypto portfolio. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a project that is poised for significant gains. As the presale nears completion and the token prepares to hit exchanges, early investors stand to benefit from the price surge that typically accompanies new token launches. Volatility and Opportunity: The Key to Maximizing Gains One thing that both Uniswap (UNI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have in common is the potential for volatility. For Uniswap (UNI), the volatility is mitigated by its established position in the market and its ongoing development. The recent rise in Uniswap’s circulating supply, coupled with its increasing market cap, positions it well for future growth. However, investors should remain cautious of potential dips as Uniswap (UNI) moves closer to its resistance levels. Meanwhile, Mpeppe’s volatility is expected to be more pronounced as it enters the market. However, for those willing to take the risk, the rewards could be substantial. With a presale price of just $0.0021 and a growing community of investors, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is well-positioned to capitalize on the meme coin trend, particularly as the demand for gambling and P2E platforms continues to rise. Conclusion: The Best of Both Worlds By adding both Uniswap (UNI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) to your crypto portfolio, you can enjoy the best of both worlds. Uniswap (UNI) provides stability and long-term growth potential in the DeFi sector, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a high-growth opportunity in the emerging gambling and meme coin markets. With Uniswap (UNI) showing steady gains and Mpeppe (MPEPE) gearing up for an explosive price surge, now could be the perfect time to invest in both.

33509239,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641531,1726156835,Dogecoin Pumps As Elon Musk Engages With DOGE Community and Mpeppe Strikes Again As Top Gainer,"The meme coin market has been bustling with excitement as Dogecoin (DOGE) pumps following Elon Musk’s latest engagement with the DOGE community, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues its streak as a top gainer in the space. As Bitcoin stabilizes, both Dogecoin and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are poised to see significant gains, making them the meme coins to watch. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Musk-Driven Surge Dogecoin (DOGE) has a history of being influenced by Elon Musk, and his recent engagement with the DOGE community has reignited bullish momentum for the meme coin. On September 9, Musk posted on X (formerly Twitter) alluding to DOGE being the official mascot for the “Department of Government Efficiency,” sending the Dogecoin (DOGE) community into a frenzy. This playful tweet contributed to Dogecoin’s price recovering above $0.1, marking a significant psychological level for the meme coin. Musk’s influence on Dogecoin (DOGE) has been a driving force behind its price action, and his continued support further strengthens the coin’s position in the crypto market. Why Dogecoin Recovered Above $0.1 Dogecoin’s (DOGE) recent recovery above $0.1 can be attributed to multiple factors. First, Bitcoin’s rise to as high as $58,000 provided a much-needed boost for Dogecoin (DOGE), which shares a strong positive price correlation with Bitcoin. As Bitcoin rallied, it paved the way for Dogecoin to rise, following the flagship cryptocurrency’s upward trajectory. Additionally, Elon Musk’s renewed support for Dogecoin (DOGE) has had a direct impact on the coin’s price. His cryptic posts and playful references to DOGE have always led to market excitement, and this time is no different. Investors flocked back to Dogecoin (DOGE) following Musk’s latest tweet, driving the coin above the $0.1 mark. Legendary Dogecoin Trader’s Bold Prediction Adding to the bullish sentiment around Dogecoin (DOGE), a legendary Dogecoin (DOGE) trader recently made headlines by predicting that an AI-powered altcoin, currently in its presale stage, will outperform Shiba Inu (SHIB) in this market cycle. While Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a favorite among meme coin enthusiasts, the emergence of innovative altcoins is creating new opportunities in the space. According to the trader, while Shiba Inu is showing signs of a potential 15% surge, the AI-powered altcoin, with its real-world applications and growth potential, is set to skyrocket far beyond Shiba Inu. However, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to hold its ground as the original meme coin, thanks to its strong community and Musk’s unwavering support. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Continues to Shine as Top Gainer While Dogecoin (DOGE) enjoys its Musk-driven resurgence, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has once again emerged as one of the top gainers in the meme coin market. Mpeppe (MPEPE), known for its unique combination of meme coin culture and decentralized gaming, has captured the attention of investors looking for the next big opportunity in crypto. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a decentralized casino platform where users can stake, bet, and earn rewards in $MPEPE tokens. Its innovative approach to meme coins has set it apart from traditional speculative tokens by providing real utility and a thriving community. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) strikes again as a top gainer, it continues to solidify its position as one of the most promising meme coins in the market. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) and casino features, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just riding the wave of meme coin hype—it’s building an ecosystem that provides financial opportunity through entertainment. What’s Next for Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE)? Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently eyeing the $0.15 mark, a crucial resistance level that, if broken, could lead to further price surges. With continued support from Musk and positive market conditions for Bitcoin, DOGE is well-positioned for more upside in the near term. Mpeppe (MPEPE), on the other hand, is riding its own wave of success. As it continues to gain traction with its decentralized casino platform, analysts foresee even more gains for Mpeppe (MPEPE) as it expands its ecosystem and user base. Both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer unique value propositions in the meme coin space. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) long-standing community and Musk’s backing provide stability and growth potential, while Mpeppe’s innovative platform and real-world utility make it a standout among emerging meme coins. Conclusion: Meme Coins on the Rise As the broader crypto market shows signs of recovery, meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are capturing attention with their impressive performance. Dogecoin’s recovery above $0.1, fueled by Elon Musk’s support, and Mpeppe’s continued success as a top gainer, signal that the meme coin market still has plenty of room for growth. Investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of gains in the crypto space should keep a close eye on Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Both coins offer unique opportunities, and with the backing of strong communities and innovative features, they are well-positioned to thrive in the months to come.

Both tokens have shown strong performance despite market fluctuations, making them attractive options as the crypto market gears up for a potential bull run. As Bitcoin inches toward a breakout, let’s take a closer look at why Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe could be the coins to hold in this environment. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Bounce Back Above $0.1 Dogecoin (DOGE), the iconic meme coin, recently regained its footing above the crucial $0.1 price level, signaling a potential bullish momentum. This recovery came on the heels of Bitcoin’s own rise, demonstrating the strong positive correlation between DOGE and the flagship cryptocurrency. On September 9, 2024, Bitcoin surged from $54,000 to $58,000, helping Dogecoin (DOGE) break past the psychological $0.1 barrier. Historically, Dogecoin’s price movements have mirrored Bitcoin’s trends, and this time was no different. As Bitcoin moves toward a potential rally, it has paved the way for DOGE’s upward momentum to continue. Elon Musk’s Influence on Dogecoin A notable factor contributing to Dogecoin’s (DOGE) recent rebound is renewed support from billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk. Known for his fondness for the meme coin, Musk’s recent posts on X (formerly Twitter) highlighted his playful yet influential stance on DOGE. In one such post, Musk referred to DOGE as the official mascot for the “Department of Government Efficiency,” sparking excitement among Dogecoin (DOGE) fans and further boosting its price. Musk’s lighthearted comments often result in notable price spikes for Dogecoin (DOGE), and his latest tweets have fueled optimism for the coin’s future growth. Additionally, Musk’s legal victory in a class action lawsuit accusing him of manipulating Dogecoin’s price has provided relief to investors. The judge dismissed the claims, calling Musk’s statements “aspirational puffery.” This ruling has helped clear any regulatory concerns surrounding Musk’s influence on Dogecoin (DOGE). DOGE on Track to Reach $0.15? As Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to trade above $0.1, analysts are predicting further upward movement for the meme coin. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a bullish wedge pattern forming on DOGE’s daily chart, suggesting that a sustained close above $0.10 could trigger a rally to $0.15. In addition to chart patterns, whale activity around Dogecoin (DOGE) has increased. Data from IntoTheBlock shows a surge in large transactions, indicating that major investors are accumulating DOGE. This uptick in whale buying pressure could be the catalyst that propels Dogecoin (DOGE) to higher price levels, especially if Bitcoin breaks past $60,000. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) is the Perfect Companion to Dogecoin While Dogecoin (DOGE) is a well-established player in the meme coin sector, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as an exciting newcomer. Combining the appeal of meme coins with the world of decentralized gaming and casinos, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique proposition for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioned as a casino-themed meme coin that allows users to engage in a decentralized gambling platform, where they can earn, stake, and bet using $MPEPE tokens. Its innovative blend of entertainment and financial opportunity has quickly attracted attention in the crypto space, particularly as more investors seek out meme coins with real utility. As Bitcoin gears up for a potential rally, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has the chance to capitalize on the renewed interest in altcoins. Investors who are drawn to Dogecoin’s (DOGE) lighthearted appeal and community-driven culture may find Mpeppe (MPEPE) to be a compelling addition to their portfolio, given its rapid rise and the potential for substantial returns. Bitcoin’s Role in the Crypto Market Recovery The broader cryptocurrency market, led by Bitcoin, plays a crucial role in shaping the performance of altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Bitcoin’s recent rise from $54,000 to $58,000 has set the stage for a possible breakout above $60,000. If Bitcoin sustains this upward momentum, it could trigger a broader market recovery, benefiting altcoins across the board. Dogecoin’s historical correlation with Bitcoin means that any significant move by the flagship cryptocurrency will likely have a direct impact on DOGE’s price. Similarly, Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands to benefit from the increased visibility and liquidity that typically accompanies a Bitcoin rally. Conclusion: A Bullish Outlook for Dogecoin and Mpeppe As Bitcoin sets its sights on breaking key resistance levels, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are two altcoins that investors should keep an eye on. Dogecoin’s resurgence above $0.1, coupled with Elon Musk’s renewed support, suggests that the meme coin has more room to grow. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative casino platform and strong community engagement position it as a meme coin with serious upside potential. Whether you’re a seasoned Dogecoin (DOGE) holder or looking to explore new opportunities in the crypto space, both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer compelling reasons to hold as the market prepares for a potential breakout. With Bitcoin leading the charge, the meme coin sector could see significant gains in the coming months.

While Quant (QNT) is experiencing a surge in address activity, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is lighting up the market with its innovative features as a gambling casino ICO, offering unique opportunities for those looking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto growth. Quant (QNT) Sees Unprecedented Address Activity Surge In recent days, Quant (QNT) has witnessed a remarkable increase in address activity, signaling a potential price rebound for the asset. According to on-chain data, the number of active QNT wallets has reached its highest level since November 2022. This surge in activity is being interpreted as a strong indicator that Quant (QNT) may be gearing up for a significant move in the market.

Historically, such increases in wallet activity during a market downturn often precede a price recovery, making Quant (QNT) a coin to watch in the coming weeks. Why the Surge in Quant (QNT) Address Activity? Much of the excitement surrounding Quant (QNT) can be traced back to recent developments within the project. Thousands of wallets have been sending small amounts of QNT into Coinbase 10, a treasury account believed to be holding Quant’s assets. This has sparked speculation that Coinbase could be preparing to introduce staking for Quant (QNT), especially after a series of updates to Quant’s official site and new patents related to the token. Gilbert Verdian, Quant’s CEO, made his first appearance on Telegram in two years, further fueling the excitement. Verdian revealed that Quant (QNT) has secured regulatory and legal clarity regarding staking and reward mechanisms. This news has been warmly received by the community, with many speculating that staking options for QNT could be available on major platforms like Coinbase in the near future. With regulatory approval and the potential for staking rewards, Quant (QNT) is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing interest. As traders keep an eye on QNT address activity, there’s a palpable sense of optimism that the token could soon experience a price rebound. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Gambling Casino ICO Taking the Market by Storm While Quant (QNT) is making waves with its address activity surge, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is setting the market alight with its innovative approach to decentralized gambling. As a new ICO in the casino space, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has garnered attention for its potential to provide significant returns in 2024.

33509233,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641534,1726156804,Dogecoin and Mpeppe Two Cryptocurrencies That Guaranteed Profits When Market Turns Around,"As the cryptocurrency market navigates its way through another volatile phase, seasoned investors are keeping an eye on strategic assets like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Both cryptocurrencies are positioned for potential massive gains, especially with Bitcoin (BTC) on the verge of a significant recovery. Let’s dive into why these two meme coins are poised to benefit when the market turns around. Dogecoin (DOGE) Rides the Bitcoin Wave Dogecoin (DOGE) has always had a unique position in the crypto space, with its meme-driven culture and strong community support. Recently, Dogecoin found itself benefiting from the broader momentum in the market, especially as Bitcoin surged past the $57,000 mark. According to crypto analyst Cold Blooded Shiller, a $56,000 hold on Bitcoin could be the momentum boost needed to see some major upward movement across the crypto market. As history shows, when Bitcoin rallies, so does DOGE. In the past week, Dogecoin (DOGE) saw a 58.2% increase in large transaction volumes, according to IntoTheBlock data. Additionally, DOGE whales made transactions worth over $100,000 in a single day, indicating that large investors are preparing for a potential price surge. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Rising Star in Meme Coins While Dogecoin (DOGE) has solidified its place in the meme coin market, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly gaining ground as a promising alternative. As a casino-themed meme coin, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has attracted the attention of both retail and institutional investors. With its innovative Play-to-Earn model and unique tokenomics, MPEPE is more than just a meme—it’s a utility-based token with strong potential for growth. Strategists are bullish on Mpeppe (MPEPE), predicting a potential 200% uplift in the near future, especially as investors look to diversify their portfolios during Bitcoin’s recovery. The Mpeppe (MPEPE) community has been steadily growing, and with the cryptocurrency’s current presale price of $0.0021, it presents an attractive entry point for those seeking high returns in the meme coin space. Why Dogecoin and Mpeppe Are Cryptos to Hold With the broader crypto market stabilizing, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are two cryptocurrencies that show strong potential for future gains. Here’s why: Bitcoin’s Influence on DOGE: Historically, Dogecoin (DOGE) has shown a strong correlation with Bitcoin’s price movements. As Bitcoin recovers and rallies, it brings positive momentum to the entire crypto market, including DOGE. With analysts predicting Bitcoin could cross the $100,000 mark in 2024, Dogecoin is likely to follow suit and experience its own surge. Elon Musk’s Support for Dogecoin (DOGE): One of the most well-known factors driving DOGE is its endorsement from Elon Musk. His recent tweets have reignited enthusiasm within the Dogecoin community, pushing its price past the $0.10 mark. Musk’s influence on DOGE remains strong, and his ongoing engagement with the community keeps investors optimistic. Mpeppe’s Unique Position: While DOGE benefits from its established reputation, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as the next breakout star in the meme coin world. By offering real utility through its Play-to-Earn features and casino-based model, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides more than speculative hype. It offers tangible use cases, which is why analysts foresee Mpeppe (MPEPE) outperforming other meme coins in the next market rally. Dogecoin’s Bullish Momentum In addition to Musk’s influence, Dogecoin (DOGE) recently saw significant whale activity, with over $812 million in transactions in just 24 hours. These large-scale transactions often signal the potential for a bull run. If Bitcoin continues its recovery, Dogecoin (DOGE) could follow, breaking through its $0.15 resistance level. The surge in transaction volume suggests that investors are preparing for a major price movement. Mpeppe: A High-Growth Opportunity Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capitalizing on its strong community and utility features to attract investors. With a growing number of Dogecoin holders considering Mpeppe as an alternative or complementary investment, the casino-themed meme coin is poised for substantial gains. Market analysts believe that Mpeppe’s presale and current price point present a unique opportunity for those looking to maximize returns during Bitcoin’s next bull run. Conclusion: A Two-Coin Strategy for the Next Crypto Bull Run As the market prepares for Bitcoin’s next significant recovery, both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) present attractive options for investors. While DOGE benefits from its strong community and Musk’s support, Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out for its innovative Play-to-Earn model and growth potential. Holding both cryptocurrencies could be a smart strategy for investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of meme coin growth.

Restakers will accrue additional yield and ""Seeds"" rewards points, which qualify holders to receive token airdrops.  YieldNest will work with existing restaking protocols Kernel, Karak and Binominal.  Restaking protocol YieldNest announced the introduction of ynBNB, the first liquid-restaking token on the BNB Chain, giving users the opportunity to earn returns on top of those from staking the native BNB token.  YieldNest said it aggregates all sources of potential yield and offers access to restaking platforms including Kernel Protocol, Karak and Binominal. Restakers will then accrue yield and reward points from the selected protocols.  Restaking protocols are designed to give investors a way of maximizing yield on top of native staking. As a sector, restaking has garnered more than $25 billion in total value locked (TVL) since it emerged on the Ethereum blockchain in June 2023. Since then, restaking protocols have gone live on other layer-1 blockchains, like Solana, which has secured more than $4 billion in TVL.  Protocols often reward stakers with points, which are designed to eventually be converted into tokens at an airdrop. YieldNest is doing this through its Seeds program. Users who accumulate Seedscan earn a stake in future rewards and gain eligibility for forthcoming airdrops.  ""The launch of ynBNB marks the beginning of our journey to develop the restaking landscape on the BNB Chain,"" Amadeo Brands, YieldNest's CEO & co-founder, saidin a press release ""Our new token, ynBNB, enhances returns, facilitates participation in Kernel, Karak, and Binomial's ecosystems, and earns additional incentives.""

42417254,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXkOD,1726155647,WeWork Founder's Climate Firm Refunds Crypto Token Holders After Failed Launch: Forbes,"Flowcarbon, a climate company co-founded by WeWork's Adam Neumann, is refunding holders of its native crypto token, the ""Goddess Nature Token,"" after it failed to launch, according to a Forbes report.  The startup, which started in 2022 and raised $70 million from investors like Andreessen Horowitz to tokenize carbon credits by bringing them onto the blockchain, planned to create a token backed 1:1 by carbon credits.  Carbon credits aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere by allowing their owners to offset a certain amount of emissions. Each credit represents one metric ton of carbon dioxide removed.  While most carbon credits are directly purchased from a project owner or a broker, Neumann's startup planned to sell them as crypto tokens.  Out of the $70 million in funding for Flowcarbon, at least $38 million was raised through the sale of the Goddess Nature Token or GNT.  But the company has now been reaching out to holders of the token to issue a refund, citing market conditions and resistance from carbon registries for the discontinuation of the token, people familiar with the matter told Forbes.  ""It's well known that since last year we have been offering refunds to retail GNT buyers due to the industry delays, with standard and customary terms, as we continue to grow Flowcarbon as a leader in carbon finance,"" Flowcarbon told Forbes.  In July 2022, CEO Dana Gibber told the Wall Street Journal that the company had paused the launch of the token to ""wait for markets to stabilize."" This came after crypto market saw an implosion from the FTX fallout and prominent carbon credit registry Verra warned against tokenizing those credits which are typically retired after purchase.  With many countries aiming to be carbon-neutral, the traditional carbon credit market has become very lucrative for investors. In 2022, the market was valued at more than $330 billion.  Tokenization, or bringing these credits onto the blockchain, was aimed at making this large market more transparent and accessible for investors. Recently, the tokenized trading project Neutral and DLT Finance, a German brokerage firm, built a regulated blockchain-backed platform for carbon credits where investors can trade them.

After a period of consolidation, buyers are showing renewed interest, driving the price higher and sparking hopes of a potential breakout. However, the question remains: can the bulls muster enough strength to overcome this key barrier, or will the $1.16 ceiling hold firm and stall further upside? This analysis explores whether SUI’s bulls have the momentum to break through the critical $1.16 resistance level. We’ll examine key technical indicators, market trends, and potential scenarios to determine if SUI can sustain its recent upward movement or if it will face another setback. Bullish Indicators: Are The Stars Aligning For A Break? On the 4-hour chart, SUI is showing strong positive momentum as it trades above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The printing of multiple bullish candlesticks highlights solid buying interest and favorable market sentiment, indicating that a break above the $1.16 level could be on the horizon. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart has climbed above the 50% mark and is currently at 69%. This upward movement suggests that upbeat momentum is strengthening, indicating that buying pressure is increasing. As the RSI approaches overbought territory, it may signal that a breakout could be imminent, with the potential for the price to push higher if the current trend continues. Related Reading: SUI Crashes 23% As September Unleashes Market Panic—Is A Comeback Possible? Technical analysis on the 1-day chart shows that SUI is also making a bullish move toward the $1.18 resistance level after the short-term pullback, highlighted by the formation of a hammer candlestick. Furthermore, the price is trading above the 100-day SMA, reinforcing the positive market sentiment, with buyers potentially driving the price higher for a potential breakout. Finally, the RSI signal line on the 1-day chart is trending above the 50% mark, currently at 64%. This suggests that SUI is still experiencing bullish pressure, with the potential for buyers to maintain their dominance and push the price higher. Critical Levels To Watch: Support And Resistance Zones For SUI SUI is approaching a key level that could determine its next move. A breakout above the $1.16 resistance level could signal a promising trend and open the path to higher targets, such as $1.44 and its all-time high of $2.18. Related Reading: SUI Soars 50%, Analyst Eyes 190% Price Rally – Details If the price is rejected at this level, SUI could find support near $0.8411. Should it fall below this support, the next potential stop might be the $0.3550 level, with further declines possibly leading to the exploration of additional key support zones. SUI was trading at approximately $1.02 at the time of writing, reflecting a 15.84% increase. The cryptocurrency has a market capitalization of over $2.7 billion and a trading volume of $418 million. Over the past 24 hours, its market cap and trading volume have increased by 15.75% and 55.47%, respectively.

This launch follows Coinbase's hint at entering the wrapped bitcoin market and challenging the existing leader, BitGo's WBTC, with plans to foster a significant bitcoin economy on Base.  A tokenized version of bitcoin {{BTC}} offered by Coinbase (COIN) has gone live on the Ethereum and Base networks. The crypto exchange is entering a market whose biggest player is backed by over $8 billion worth of the asset.  The Coinbase Wrapped BTC (cbBTC) is an ERC-20 token backed on a 1:1 basis with bitcoin (BTC) held by Coinbase. Such wrapped tokens allow users to utilize bitcoin they already hold in new ways onchain, such as providing their bitcoin as liquidity to decentralized finance DeFi protocols, or using it as collateral to borrow other crypto assets.  Several DeFi services are expected to offer support for cbBTC from Thursday, Coinbase said, including exchanges Aerodrome and Curve, lending applications Aave, Sky Protocol, Compound, real-world assets provider Maple and cross-chain bridges such as deBridge, among others.  Bitcoin sent by Coinbase users from the exchange to specific addresses on Base or Ethereum will automatically be converted 1:1 to cbBTC. When users receive cbBTC in their Coinbase accounts, it will be converted 1:1 from cbBTC to BTC.  At launch, cbBTC will be available to Coinbase users in the U.S. (excluding New York State), U.K., EEA states, Singapore, Australia, and Brazil.  Justin Sun on cbBTC  The token comes weeks after Coinbase first teased an announcement amid controversy around BitGo’s wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) token - which leads the wrapped bitcoin category and is worth over $8 billion as of Thursday.  At the time, Jesse Pollak, who created Base, said the team planned to build a ""massive bitcoin economy"" on the network.  Tron founder Justin Sun, who partially controls an entity named BiT Global that now handles the custody for WBTC, used Thursday's announcement to post what he describes as drawbacks of the new Coinbase offering.

33507932,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641485,1726153243,Why This AI Social Scoring Meme Coin Will Be Most Affected When Ethereum and Bitcoin Hit New ATH,"As the cryptocurrency market waits for the next big move in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), savvy traders are already positioning themselves for the potential fallout. While much of the focus is on how these top two cryptocurrencies will perform in the next market surge, the spotlight is also turning to an innovative new project—GoodEgg (GEGG), an AI-driven meme coin with a social scoring system. The question on many investors’ minds is simple: how will GoodEgg (GEGG) fare when Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) hit new all-time highs? Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH): Countdown to a Showdown According to market analysts, the cryptocurrency world is on the brink of a major shift, with only days remaining until a key event that could significantly influence Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices. On September 18, 2024, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision will likely set the tone for the next few months in the crypto space. With Bitcoin (BTC) already locked in a downward trend since March and Ethereum (ETH) suffering an even steeper decline, many are wondering what the future holds for the broader market—and how altcoins like GoodEgg (GEGG) will react. Will GoodEgg (GEGG) Be Affected? While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are the market’s pillars, altcoins like GoodEgg (GEGG) tend to react significantly to changes in macroeconomic conditions. The anticipated lowering of interest rates by the Federal Reserve could drive capital back into risk assets like cryptocurrencies, creating a favorable environment for a wide range of projects. But why would GoodEgg (GEGG), a meme coin, be particularly sensitive to the movements of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)? The reason lies in its AI-powered ‘Social Scoring System’, which rewards users based on social interactions within the GoodEgg ecosystem. This innovative feature ensures that GoodEgg (GEGG) is not just riding the meme wave but also offers real utility through decentralized engagement. As more investors hedge their positions in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), they could shift some of their capital into innovative projects like GoodEgg (GEGG), further accelerating its growth. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Remain Critical Despite the rise of promising altcoins like GoodEgg (GEGG), Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) still hold significant sway over the broader market. As Bitcoin (BTC)’s dominance continues to rise, currently above 50%, and Ethereum (ETH) looks to break out of its downward trend, the fate of altcoins will largely depend on how these top two assets perform. If Bitcoin (BTC) can stay above its key resistance levels and Ethereum (ETH) breaks through $4,100, the next few months could usher in a new rally, allowing altcoins like GoodEgg (GEGG) to capitalize on the renewed investor interest. In contrast, if both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) struggle, meme coins, and altcoins will likely face further volatility. What to Expect for GoodEgg (GEGG) When Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Hit New ATH Once Bitcoin (BTC) breaches the $85,000 mark and Ethereum (ETH) climbs to $4,100, market sentiment is expected to turn extremely bullish, creating a rising tide that lifts all boats—including GoodEgg (GEGG). For GoodEgg (GEGG), a surge in market activity for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) could mean an influx of new investors looking for the next big thing. Since GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a blend of meme culture and social engagement through blockchain technology, its appeal goes beyond the standard meme coin. The AI-driven Social Scoring System makes GoodEgg (GEGG) a project with the potential for long-term sustainability, even as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) continue to dominate the crypto market. Conclusion: Will GoodEgg (GEGG) Ride the Wave? While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) will likely continue to set the tone for the cryptocurrency market, innovative projects like GoodEgg (GEGG) stand to benefit the most from the next major bull run. As traders look for ways to diversify their portfolios, projects offering unique features like GoodEgg (GEGG)‘s AI-powered social scoring could provide significant upside. If Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) hit new ATHs, expect GoodEgg (GEGG) to be among the altcoins leading the charge.

33507930,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641480,1726153223,"Cardano Price Prediction: Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday, GoodEgg Coin Almost Reached $0.00021","The crypto market continues to display volatile movements, with major coins like Cardano (ADA) and emerging meme coins like GoodEgg (GEGG) showing varying levels of activity. While Cardano (ADA) attempts to maintain its price position after a modest bounce, GoodEgg (GEGG) is nearing an impressive milestone of $0.00021, attracting attention from both retail and institutional investors. Cardano (ADA): Will the Bounce Last? The Cardano (ADA) price has been on a rollercoaster recently, with small gains seen over the past few days. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Cardano (ADA) has shown a 0.4% increase in value in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.3423 at the time of writing. While this modest rise may not seem overly significant, it has helped keep Cardano (ADA) in the green zone for the moment. On the hourly chart, Cardano (ADA) appears to have found a local resistance level at $0.3444. Should the price manage to close well below this level, analysts predict the token may experience a short-term decline, potentially falling back to the support level at $0.3374 in the coming days. However, if Cardano (ADA) manages to break through the resistance and fix above $0.3458, it could accumulate enough bullish momentum to rise into the $0.36-$0.37 range by midweek. Long-term predictions for Cardano (ADA) remain cautious. On the larger time frame, the picture is more positive, but any significant gains will depend on whether the weekly bar closes near its peak. If Cardano (ADA) can maintain upward pressure throughout the week, traders could see prices rally to new levels. GoodEgg (GEGG): A Growing Sensation While Cardano (ADA) continues to battle for market stability, GoodEgg (GEGG) is making waves in the meme coin space. GoodEgg (GEGG) is nearing an important milestone, with its price now approaching $0.00021. This Play-2-Date meme coin has gained traction due to its innovative social-fi features, which reward users for participating in social interactions within its decentralized platform. Investors are particularly attracted to GoodEgg (GEGG) due to its unique blend of gaming, dating, and crypto investment opportunities. With the platform set to introduce its AI-powered social scoring system, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a fresh take on how meme coins can evolve beyond mere speculation. The GoodEgg (GEGG) rally has been one of the more impressive success stories in the meme coin market. As it approaches $0.00021, some analysts believe that the token could see another leg up, especially as whales and retail investors alike pile into this trending project. Unlike Cardano (ADA), which relies on its scalability and smart contract capabilities, GoodEgg (GEGG) draws its strength from its community-driven features and innovative platform. Cardano’s (ADA) Future Outlook As the week progresses, all eyes will be on Cardano (ADA) to see if it can maintain its momentum or whether a retracement is in store. The technical indicators suggest that Cardano (ADA) faces several key resistance levels, starting with $0.3444. If Cardano (ADA) can break through this level and fix above $0.3458, then it has a chance of reaching the $0.36-$0.37 range by Thursday or Friday. However, if Cardano (ADA) fails to gain momentum and the broader crypto market turns bearish, ADA could see a short-term decline, with the price potentially falling back to $0.3374. The weekly bar will be an important signal for traders, as a close far from the peak could indicate a lack of sustained buying interest. Conclusion: GoodEgg (GEGG) Leads the Way While Cardano (ADA) continues to battle against resistance and market uncertainty, GoodEgg (GEGG) is quickly capturing investor attention with its unique Play-2-Date platform. As GoodEgg (GEGG) approaches $0.00021, it’s becoming clear that this meme coin has more to offer than just hype—it’s creating a new path in the decentralized gaming and social interaction space. For those holding Cardano (ADA), the next few days will be critical as the token tests resistance levels. Meanwhile, GoodEgg (GEGG) is proving that there’s room for both utility-driven and community-focused tokens in the evolving crypto landscape.

While Cardano (ADA) has already established itself as a strong contender with a robust ecosystem, some experts are now turning their attention to GoodEgg (GEGG), predicting it could surge by 5000x before the end of the year. Let’s explore what makes these two cryptocurrencies unique and why GoodEgg (GEGG) is seen as having explosive growth potential. Cardano (ADA): Three Signals Point to an Upcoming Price Rally Despite the current market volatility, Cardano (ADA) continues to show signs of resilience, with key indicators suggesting that the token may be on the verge of a price surge. A recent technical analysis highlighted three critical signals that support this outlook: Growing Network Activity: Cardano (ADA) has seen a remarkable increase in network activity, particularly with its Plutus scripts (smart contracts) jumping 75%, reaching over 74,000. Additionally, the number of native tokens on the network has surged by 85%, surpassing the 10-million mark. With thousands of projects launching on the platform and hundreds of new tokens minted, Cardano (ADA) continues to solidify its position as a leader in the decentralized finance space. Bullish Divergence Pattern: Analysts have identified a bullish divergence pattern in the ADA/BTC chart, which is reminiscent of a similar signal observed in 2020 that led to a 1000% price surge for ADA. This suggests that Cardano (ADA) could outperform Bitcoin if an “Altcoin Season” occurs. With the potential for macroeconomic factors such as interest rate cuts to revitalize broader crypto markets, ADA is well-positioned for growth. Technical Chart Confirmation: Technical indicators for Cardano (ADA) are also pointing towards an upward trend. A “W”-shaped double-bottom formation has emerged, a classic bullish signal. If ADA breaks through the $0.40 resistance level, it could trigger a rally. Correlations with Bitcoin suggest that Cardano (ADA) could rise alongside the leading cryptocurrency, especially if major resistance levels are overcome. Why GoodEgg (GEGG) Could 5000x Before Year-End While Cardano (ADA) continues to develop as a strong contender in the DeFi space, many investors are looking to newer projects like GoodEgg (GEGG) for even more substantial gains. The GoodEgg (GEGG) Play-2-Date meme coin is currently gaining traction due to its innovative ecosystem and high-growth potential. Analysts believe GEGG could skyrocket by 5000x before the end of 2024. GoodEgg (GEGG) recently announced its AI-powered “Social Scoring System,” a feature designed to reward users for their social interactions on the platform. This unique approach to combining social engagement and blockchain technology has attracted considerable attention from investors, including major crypto whales. The presale of GEGG tokens is now in its third stage, priced at $0.00015, making it an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the next big meme coin. The GoodEgg (GEGG) ecosystem is poised to challenge other meme coins and even established projects like Cardano (ADA) in the long run. With whales flocking to GEGG, the potential for exponential growth is clear, especially as the project rolls out more features in its roadmap. What to Expect for Both Projects For Cardano (ADA), the future remains bright. The continuous innovation within its ecosystem, coupled with strong technical indicators, suggests that ADA could break out of its current price range and see significant gains in the coming months. The bullish divergence, growing network activity, and technical chart patterns all point to a potential rally. Meanwhile, GoodEgg (GEGG) is quickly establishing itself as a major contender in the meme coin space. Its unique Play-2-Date model, combined with its AI-powered features, has caught the attention of crypto whales and retail investors alike. With the potential for a 5000x surge, GEGG is positioned to be one of the top-performing tokens by year-end. Conclusion As both Cardano (ADA) and GoodEgg (GEGG) continue to make headlines, it’s clear that these two cryptocurrencies offer exciting opportunities for investors. While Cardano (ADA) may be a more established player with strong technical signals for a potential price rally, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers the kind of explosive growth that meme coin investors crave. For those looking to diversify their portfolios, both Cardano (ADA) and GoodEgg (GEGG) present compelling options. As 2024 draws to a close, it will be interesting to see which of these tokens delivers the most impressive returns.

However, while Cardano (ADA) focuses on enhancing its technical infrastructure, some investors and whales are exploring new opportunities like GoodEgg (GEGG), an innovative Play-2-Date meme coin that has already rallied by 180%. As scalability remains a key concern for Cardano (ADA), the ADA community seems hedged, balancing their investments between established tokens and emerging meme coins like GoodEgg (GEGG). Cardano (ADA): A Future-Focused Blockchain With Scalability At Its Core Cardano (ADA) has long prided itself on being one of the most energy-efficient and scalable blockchain networks. Launched in 2017, the blockchain boasts a maximum coin supply of 45 billion ADA tokens and employs the eco-friendly Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This scalability and sustainability give Cardano (ADA) an edge over more energy-intensive blockchains, making it a popular choice among developers and environmentally-conscious investors alike. Recent price updates for Cardano (ADA) suggest that the token has built strong support around the $0.3119 mark. According to technical analysis, this level has seen strong buying interest, preventing any significant drops below this threshold. In the event of a potential breakout, Cardano (ADA) could target the next resistance at $0.3501, with the 50-Daily EMA (Exponential Moving Average) adding additional pressure near this level. However, if the broader market experiences another Bitcoin-related downturn, ADA may struggle and fall back to the $0.2756 support. Cardano’s (ADA) Scalability Plans and Market Sentiment Charles Hoskinson’s recent announcement regarding Cardano (ADA)’s scalability plans has sparked renewed interest within the ADA community. With plans to improve the network’s transaction speed and reduce congestion, the scalability upgrades are designed to support more decentralized applications (dApps) and facilitate smoother network operations. These upgrades align with Cardano (ADA)’s long-term roadmap, which aims to secure its place as a leader in the blockchain space, particularly in the sectors of finance, supply chain, and governance. While Cardano (ADA) continues to make technological strides, its market performance has been less predictable. Despite positive sentiment surrounding the scalability updates, Cardano (ADA)’s price remains volatile. Analysts at BeInNews Academy have pointed out that despite recent gains, the ADA price could drop to $0.27 if selling pressure increases. However, there is optimism that with enough demand, Cardano (ADA) could see a rise to $0.47, an ambitious target for the near future. GoodEgg (GEGG): The Play-2-Date Meme Coin Capturing Investor Attention While Cardano (ADA) investors wait for the scalability upgrades to reflect in ADA’s price, many are turning to more unconventional opportunities like GoodEgg (GEGG). Unlike Cardano (ADA), which focuses on utility and infrastructure, GoodEgg (GEGG) taps into the meme coin market, offering a novel Play-2-Date platform that blends AI technology with social interaction. The token’s recent 180% rally has sparked significant interest from both retail investors and whales looking for the next big opportunity in the meme coin sector. GoodEgg (GEGG)’s Play-2-Date model is designed to reward users for engaging in social interactions, making it more than just a meme coin. Its AI-powered app, set to be released soon, promises to enhance the platform’s social scoring system, bringing more real-world utility to the project. This blend of AI and social finance has positioned GoodEgg (GEGG) as a serious contender in the rapidly growing meme coin market, attracting investors who are eager to diversify their portfolios. The ADA Community’s Hedging Strategy While the Cardano (ADA) community remains loyal to its core investment, many are diversifying into GoodEgg (GEGG). This hedging strategy allows them to maintain their positions in Cardano (ADA), a token with strong utility and a clear roadmap, while also participating in the speculative and potentially highly lucrative meme coin space. GoodEgg (GEGG)’s potential for explosive growth has made it an attractive alternative, especially as the meme coin sector shows no signs of slowing down. The ADA community’s strategy reflects a broader trend in the crypto space, where investors seek to balance their portfolios between stable, utility-driven tokens like Cardano (ADA) and high-risk, high-reward meme coins like GoodEgg (GEGG). With GoodEgg (GEGG) already showing promising returns, it’s clear that the token is poised to capture more market attention as its platform develops and its user base grows. Conclusion As Cardano (ADA) focuses on long-term scalability, its community remains watchful of both technical developments and market performance. Meanwhile, GoodEgg (GEGG) has emerged as a strong competitor in the meme coin space, offering investors an exciting opportunity for short-term gains. The balance between these two investments, Cardano (ADA) for stability and utility, and GoodEgg (GEGG) for speculative growth represents a new era in cryptocurrency investing, where diversification is key to maximizing returns in an ever-evolving market.

42417264,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXkUP,1726153200,Crypto for Advisors: Tokenization of Real World Assets,"The creation of a digital representation of assets via blockchain-based tokens is growing. In today’s issue, Herwig Konings from Security Token Market examines the growth of this industry and why tokenization matters.  In Ask an Expert, Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, answers questions about why investors are looking at these assets in the current market.  – Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Why Over $40 Billion in Tokenized Securities Should Be Considered for Investment Portfolios  Tokenized assets such as equities, bonds, funds, real estate, and asset-backed securities have attracted more attention this year than ever before. Known in the crypto world as “real world assets,” these RWAs are being explored by financial giants such as BlackRock, Hamilton Lane, JP Morgan, DTCC and Broadridge as their operational efficiencies and different return profiles continue to emerge.  What does it mean to be tokenized? Leveraging blockchain technology, these RWA tokens are digital representations of financial instruments like those stated above. Unlike crypto, these digital assets follow applicable securities laws worldwide. They run on regulated platforms while tapping decentralized finance (DeFi) applications for enhanced performance and utility.  Examples of tokenized assets Security Token Market has seen come to market include pre-IPO company equity, resorts, wine and diamond funds and unique securities backed by bitcoin mining or liquidity events from a portfolio of companies. On the more traditional side, we’ve seen feeder funds such as Hamilton Lane’s Secondary Fund VI available on Securitize or liquidity products such as the BlackRock USD Institutional Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and Franklin Templeton’s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX). Why liquidity products? Check out our piece for CoinDesk Crypto Long & Short.  Why bring traditional, large funds on-chain? Financial advisors may seek higher-performing assets to enhance client portfolios. However, such funds tend to have high investment minimums, for example, $5 million. What if your clients could participate at a fraction of that, say $20,000? More clients get to take advantage of attractive risk-adjusted returns, advisors can rebalance a bit more granularly, and issuers can manage their investors more easily, thanks to the power of blockchain. This holds true of many assets, allowing for portfolio customization especially in an era where the transfer of wealth exposes different asset allocation preferences and risk profiles. This includes younger generations eager to participate in crypto markets.  How do RWAs perform compared to crypto? Do they also see outrageous returns? The short answer is no, but they can help stabilize portfolios revolving around digital assets, unlock access to previously challenging asset classes to tap into, and bring utility to them, resulting in an evolving financial ecosystem.  Taking from STM’s RWA Securities Market Update - August 2024 report, a hypothetical security token bundle of all STM-tracked RWAs outperformed the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), closing August out up 3.03% versus the CD20’s 14.45% loss this month. How does this compare to past performance? The security token basket has remained mainly in the lower single-digit positive returns, whereas the CD20 has seen some months with similar performance and others with double-digit losses. This speaks to crypto’s volatile nature.  As noted in the previous edition of STM’s report, traditional markets saw a negative start to August 2024 amid the Nikkei’s crash, unemployment numbers, and fears of a US recession, among other catalysts. Crypto subsequently experienced that loss, working to recover throughout the month but ultimately coming back down. While some security tokens have also experienced losses, others saw significant growth ultimately helping the basket keep its positive performance. For additional information on RWAs, view our latest research report.  - Herwig Konings, CEO and founder, Security Token Market  Ask an Expert  Q. The tokenized treasury market recently crossed $2B in total value locked (TVL). How do you see that market evolving?  The market will continue to grow at a high rate because there is still untapped potential in these tokenized treasuries. For example, in traditional finance, no one posts dollars as collateral. There’s $2 in treasuries for every dollar. In crypto it’s the other way around, with over $150B in stablecoins compared to $2B in treasuries. That makes no sense and is a dynamic that will eventually reverse. Large crypto institutions will begin to post a stable value fund, like a tokenized short-dated treasury that earns a yield for that institution, as collateral instead of a stablecoin where the yield goes to the issuer. Institutions are starting to utilize tokenized treasuries for their treasury management. There’s functionality that will be unlocked, which will increase the adoption and help the fund and the tokenized treasury market continue to grow.  Q. If the Fed adjusts interest rates this month as expected, how will the demand for tokenizing different asset classes potentially shift?  When interest rates are high, investors want to have their money in treasuries. If you’re earning 5% on your asset with no risk, why would you want to put it into a different, more illiquid asset that has yield but a much higher risk?  We expect interest rates to decrease over the next 12 to 18 months.  It’s important to remember that Interest rates are high and inflation is high too, so investors aren’t really earning the yield they think they’re earning because their dollars are being depreciated. When both rates and inflation come down, treasuries will still be valuable because it’s risk-free. Meanwhile, there will be demand for other fixed-income assets that are adjacent to treasuries on the risk curve. They offer higher yield and are still liquid, thus compensating for the drop in risk-free yields. Those types of asset classes, like private credit for example, will become the next trend in this tokenization wave.  - Carlos Domingo, CEO and co-founder, Securitize  Keep Reading  Switzerland’s fourth largest bank, ZKB, offers retail clients the ability to buy and sell bitcoin and Ether.

Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Is In A ‘Healthier’ Place Now, Here’s Why XRP Trust Announced, Is The XRP ETF Incoming? Digital assets manager Grayscale today announced the launch of a closed-end XRP trust in the US, paving the way for institutional investors to gain exposure to the top 10 cryptocurrencies, an official announcement by Ripple confirms. Commenting on the development, Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Grayscale’s Head of Product & Research, said: We believe Grayscale XRP Trust gives investors exposure to a protocol with an important real-world use case. By facilitating cross-border payments that take just seconds to complete, XRP has the potential to transform the legacy financial infrastructure. For the uninitiated, a closed-end trust differs from an exchange-traded fund (ETF) because it allows certain investors to gain exposure to the underlying asset with relatively fewer regulatory constraints. On the other hand, an ETF approval requires several checks from regulators – in this case, from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before they are made available to investors. That being said, it’s worth highlighting that an approved trust holds the potential to transform into an ETF with the required regulatory approvals. For example, Grayscale’s single-asset investment trusts – Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) – were given the go-ahead to become ETFs earlier this year. Related Reading: 11% Of Bitcoin Supply In Coinbase’s Hands: Analyzing The Potential Risks As a result, it won’t be surprising to see an XRP ETF in the US sometime soon.

Interestingly, the XRP trust’s launch comes when its parent company, Ripple, is tackling multiple legal battles with the US SEC.

The platform’s ability to reward users for their participation in dating activities and community engagement has already captured the attention of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales, who are increasingly following the money into this promising new territory. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Whale Magnet Dogecoin (DOGE), once dismissed as a mere joke, has grown into a major player in the cryptocurrency space. Originally introduced in 2013, Dogecoin (DOGE) gained massive popularity through viral internet culture and endorsements from high-profile personalities like Elon Musk. Its journey to an all-time high of $0.74 in mid-2021 was driven by whale activity and retail interest alike, transforming Dogecoin into a serious investment opportunity for both seasoned and new crypto investors. Despite recent market downturns, Dogecoin (DOGE) has remained a favorite among whales, who often make significant market moves with their vast capital. With the advent of GoodEgg’s AI-powered app, many Dogecoin (DOGE) whales are now diversifying their holdings, seeing GoodEgg (GEGG) as a high-potential addition to their portfolios. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Underdog Gains New Support Launched in August 2020, Shiba Inu (SHIB) was designed as the “Dogecoin killer,” but it quickly established itself as a standalone force in the crypto world. Shiba Inu enjoyed a meteoric rise fueled by its vibrant community and retail investor enthusiasm, peaking at a market cap of over $40 billion. However, like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced periods of volatility, with its value subject to the whims of social media trends and whale activity. The introduction of GoodEgg’s AI-powered app comes at a time when Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales are searching for fresh opportunities. The Social Scoring System embedded in the GEGG ecosystem, which allows users to earn rewards based on social interactions, has caught the attention of these large-scale investors. As more Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales take notice, the momentum behind GoodEgg (GEGG) continues to build. GoodEgg (GEGG): The Game-Changing Social-Fi Platform GoodEgg (GEGG) is positioning itself as more than just another meme coin. Its integration of Play-to-Date (P2D) technology and AI-powered social scoring sets it apart from the traditional meme coin market. The platform rewards users with GEGG tokens for engaging in dating activities, progressing through levels, and unlocking NFTs. With a presale that has already sold 70% of its tokens at a price of $0.00015, GoodEgg is gaining traction fast. The Social Scoring System built into GoodEgg’s AI-powered app takes user engagement to the next level by offering personalized experiences based on a user’s interactions within the ecosystem. This makes GEGG more than just a speculative asset; it becomes a utility token with real-world applications. As more investors recognize the long-term value of this project, the influx of capital from Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales is expected to continue. Whales Follow the Money Historically, whales (investors) who hold significant amounts of a particular cryptocurrency—have had a profound impact on the market. Their actions can propel a coin to new heights or, conversely, lead to major sell-offs. With GoodEgg’s innovative approach to meme coins, these whales are increasingly shifting their focus from Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) to GEGG, seeing it as a project with immense growth potential. The addition of an AI-powered app to the GoodEgg (GEGG) ecosystem has only heightened the excitement. With the app enhancing the Social Scoring System, GoodEgg offers a novel way for users to earn rewards based on real-world interactions, tapping into the booming Social-Fi sector. This is not just about trading; it’s about creating a vibrant, engaging community where users can benefit both socially and financially. The Road Ahead: $0.5 Pending? As more Dogecoin (DOGE) and SHIB whales turn their attention to GoodEgg (GEGG), the question on everyone’s mind is: Can GoodEgg (GEGG) hit the $0.5 mark? Given its strong start, innovative platform, and growing whale interest, many believe that this ambitious target could be within reach sooner than anticipated. While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to dominate the meme coin space, GoodEgg (GEGG) is carving out its niche, offering a new level of utility and engagement for investors. In conclusion, with its unique AI-powered app and Social Scoring System, GoodEgg (GEGG) is capturing the attention of not just retail investors but also the whale community that once propelled Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) to stratospheric heights. As GEGG continues to innovate and grow, it’s poised to become the next big player in the meme coin arena.

33506490,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641461,1726149621,Top 3 Most Profitably Meme Coins: Millionaire Who invested $100k In Each Receives Bigger Return In GEGG Than In SHIB and Doge,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, meme coins continue to capture the attention of both retail and institutional investors. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), the titans of the meme coin arena, have brought considerable profits to early investors. However, a recent analysis shows that GoodEgg (GEGG), a newer entrant in the meme coin market, is offering significantly higher returns. A millionaire who invested $100K in each meme coin found that GoodEgg’s profits outshined both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), making GEGG a strong contender in the meme coin space. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Pioneer Still Battling Volatility Dogecoin (DOGE), often regarded as the original meme coin, has seen a rise and fall that few cryptocurrencies can rival. Initially created as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin (DOGE) captured the hearts of millions, thanks to its community-driven approach and backing by influential figures like Elon Musk. By 2021, Dogecoin (DOGE) reached unimaginable heights, with its price skyrocketing due to internet memes, social media hype, and celebrity endorsements. However, for those who bought in at its peak, Dogecoin (DOGE) has proven to be a double-edged sword. Santiment’s data reveals that while Dogecoin (DOGE) saw a short-term gain of 1.7%, long-term holders have faced losses of up to 20.8%. As social media discussions about DOGE diminish, analysts believe its future price movement will depend heavily on FOMO (fear of missing out) and FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) cycles. Despite its volatility, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Many traders continue to eye it for short-term gains, while others are holding on, hoping for a resurgence of interest and market excitement. But with retail investors showing less enthusiasm and few major developments, it’s unclear when DOGE will regain its bullish momentum. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Struggling to Regain Its 2021 Glory Shiba Inu (SHIB), born in the wake of Dogecoin (DOGE)’s popularity, initially positioned itself as the “DOGE killer.” SHIB took the meme coin world by storm in 2021 with massive gains, propelling it into the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Yet, 2024 has not been as kind to Shiba Inu (SHIB). According to Santiment, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has underperformed compared to Dogecoin (DOGE), with long-term holders suffering losses of 31.7%. Retail investors have been slowly exiting SHIB, and the lack of significant social media engagement reflects the coin’s waning popularity. The decrease in Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s small-wallet supply indicates that many short-term investors have cashed out, leaving behind larger whales who continue to hold. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggles with maintaining its user base, it’s still ranked among the top meme coins. But with its long-term returns showing a sharp decline and the lack of major catalysts, SHIB investors are left wondering when—or if—the meme coin will experience a significant recovery. GoodEgg (GEGG): The Meme Coin Revolutionizing the Market In contrast to the mixed results seen with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), GoodEgg (GEGG) has made an impressive entry into the meme coin market. This new meme coin, with its unique AI-powered SocialFi and Play-to-Date (P2D) model, is gaining momentum faster than expected. While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) rely heavily on social media-driven hype, GoodEgg (GEGG) has carved out a niche by combining social interaction with real-world utility. GoodEgg (GEGG) allows users to earn rewards by participating in dating activities, unlocking NFTs, and engaging with the platform. Unlike traditional meme coins that thrive on speculation, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a tangible use case in the world of decentralized dating, positioning itself as a hybrid meme coin with practical value. A recent report showed that a millionaire who invested $100K in GoodEgg (GEGG) saw a higher return than those who placed the same amount in Dogecoin (DOGE) or Shiba Inu (SHIB). With 70% of GoodEgg (GEGG)’s Stage 1 presale completed, investors are increasingly viewing it as a long-term growth opportunity. The project’s innovative approach to blending cryptocurrency, blockchain, and social engagement has resonated with a broad range of investors. Its presale success and steady price increase, currently at $0.00015, make GoodEgg (GEGG) a strong contender in the meme coin space. Meme Coin Market: The Road Ahead The meme coin market is notorious for its volatility, with coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) seeing rapid rises and sudden drops in value. Yet, the introduction of innovative projects like GoodEgg (GEGG) suggests that meme coins can evolve beyond mere speculation. While Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to hover near the top of the cryptocurrency rankings, its reliance on social media engagement and market sentiment makes it prone to significant fluctuations. Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s struggle to regain its 2021 momentum and waning social presence raise concerns about its long-term viability. GoodEgg (GEGG)’s fresh approach to the meme coin formula gives it a distinct advantage. With its Play-to-Date model and AI-powered social engagement platform, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers investors something more than the typical meme coin hype. As the project continues to gain traction, it’s poised to challenge the dominance of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) in the meme coin arena. Conclusion For investors in the meme coin space, Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and GoodEgg (GEGG) each offer different opportunities. Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a strong contender for short-term traders, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) may see a recovery if market conditions improve. However, GoodEgg (GEGG)’s innovative model and growing investor interest set it apart, delivering higher returns than its more established counterparts. As the meme coin market continues to evolve, GoodEgg (GEGG)’s combination of utility, innovation, and community engagement positions it as the next big thing in crypto. Investors looking for the next meme coin breakout may find that GoodEgg (GEGG) offers the best potential for long-term growth.

33506487,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641466,1726149615,"Pepe Coin Undervalued Or Reached Its Peak? Whales Move Towards New Play-2 Date Meme Coin, Currently Rallying 180%","Pepecoin (PEPE) has been a central focus of the meme coin market for much of 2024. Despite an initial surge to an all-time high of $0.000014 in May, the token has since experienced a correction of over 50%. This significant pullback has left many investors wondering whether Pepecoin (PEPE) is undervalued or if it has already peaked. Recently, analysts have suggested that Pepecoin (PEPE) may be on the verge of a rebound. Key indicators, such as the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio, currently sitting at 1.34, hint that Pepecoin (PEPE) might have reached a market bottom. The ratio, which compares an asset’s current market cap to its realized cap (the value at which investors originally acquired their tokens), suggests that Pepecoin (PEPE) may now be undervalued. If history is any guide, this presents a potential buying opportunity for those looking to catch a rally. However, amid the uncertainty surrounding Pepecoin (PEPE), whales have begun diverting their attention toward GoodEgg (GEGG), a new Play-2-Date meme coin currently rallying 180%. As PEPE navigates its recovery, GEGG has captured the market’s attention with its innovative Play-2-Date model, combining social engagement with financial rewards. The rapid rise in GoodEgg (GEGG)’s value has already attracted significant whale activity, with many investors opting to add the token to their portfolios. Money Flow Index Supports Bullish Sentiment for PEPE Another bullish indicator for Pepecoin (PEPE) is the Money Flow Index (MFI), which measures buying and selling pressure. Recently, the MFI for Pepecoin (PEPE) dropped to an oversold level of 17.25, but it has since begun to rise. This uptick suggests growing buying interest in PEPE, which could signal an upcoming rally. Analysts have pointed out that Pepecoin (PEPE) is currently trading within a demand zone, which previously propelled the price to $0.0000087 in early August. If the current buying momentum continues, PEPE could break through key resistance levels, including the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $0.0000079. Should this happen, the token could climb as high as $0.000010, representing a potential 53% gain from its current price. However, if Pepecoin (PEPE) fails to break through the $0.0000075 resistance, it could face further declines, with a potential fallback to $0.0000066. Whales Shift to GoodEgg (GEGG) as It Surges by 180% While Pepecoin (PEPE) shows signs of a potential rebound, whales are starting to diversify into other opportunities. A notable shift has occurred with large-scale investors moving into GoodEgg (GEGG), a new Play-2-Date meme coin that has captured significant attention in the crypto community. GoodEgg (GEGG) differentiates itself by combining elements of social interaction with gaming rewards. It allows users to participate in dating challenges, earn GEGG tokens, and unlock exclusive NFTs, creating an innovative platform that merges real-world utility with the fun of meme culture. The platform’s AI-powered social scoring system has also been a huge draw, allowing users to engage with others in a gamified setting while earning rewards. This unique approach has positioned GEGG as a standout in the crowded meme coin space, attracting both retail and institutional investors alike. Currently, GoodEgg (GEGG) is in its presale phase and has already rallied by 180%. With its low token price of $0.00015 and rapidly growing interest, many are predicting that GEGG could deliver substantial returns to early investors, much like Pepecoin (PEPE) did earlier in 2024. Final Thoughts While Pepecoin (PEPE) shows signs of being undervalued, with analysts predicting a potential 50% rally, whales are not waiting around. Large investors are moving into GoodEgg (GEGG), a new meme coin with innovative Play-2-Date features and a fast-growing presale. As PEPE works through its current market conditions, GEGG is attracting attention as a potential high-growth alternative in the meme coin ecosystem. With both coins offering unique opportunities, investors should watch the market closely as we head into the last quarter of 2024. Whether Pepecoin (PEPE) rebounds or GoodEgg (GEGG) continues its explosive growth, the meme coin space remains one of the most dynamic sectors in cryptocurrency today.

33506484,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641458,1726149614,Dogecoin Vs Shiba Inu Vs GoodEgg: New Contender GEGG Has Edge On The Meme Market After Releasing This Game Changing Announcment,"The meme coin space is heating up as the rivalry between Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and the latest contender, GoodEgg (GEGG), intensifies. While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu have enjoyed long-standing popularity as market leaders in the meme coin ecosystem, GoodEgg (GEGG) is now making waves with a recent game-changing announcement that sets it apart. Could this new announcement give GoodEgg (GEGG) the edge over its rivals, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu? Dogecoin (DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Battling Volatility Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin, has remained a dominant force in the crypto market for years. However, Dogecoin (DOGE)’s price has been on a rollercoaster ride, fluctuating in response to market sentiment and social media hype. According to Santiment’s latest on-chain data, Dogecoin (DOGE)’s price movements are strongly correlated with its MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratios. The 30-day MVRV ratio, which reflects short-term speculative trading, suggests that DOGE is currently facing high volatility, with long-term holders sitting at a loss. Despite this, analysts are optimistic that Dogecoin (DOGE) could see price recoveries as social interest and sentiment shift. Recent spikes in Dogecoin (DOGE)’s social dominance indicate that the token continues to be a focal point in the meme coin conversation. While volatility may persist, sentiment-driven traders could see opportunities in DOGE’s price fluctuations. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Recovery in Sight Based on MVRV Data Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second-largest meme coin by market capitalization, has been navigating a challenging year. However, according to Santiment’s analysis, SHIB’s MVRV ratios show signs of recovery. The 30-day MVRV ratio indicates that short-term holders are largely at a loss, which historically signals a buying opportunity for investors. Meanwhile, the 365-day MVRV ratio is neutral, reflecting resilience among long-term SHIB holders. As Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to build its ecosystem and garner attention with new developments like a potential SHIB ETF, market experts believe that SHIB’s price could recover in the near term. The MVRV data suggests that deep negative values often precede price increases, making SHIB a token to watch in the coming weeks. GoodEgg (GEGG): The Rising Contender with a Game-Changing Announcement While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to battle volatility and market fluctuations, GoodEgg (GEGG) has emerged as a serious contender in the meme coin space. GoodEgg (GEGG)’s unique blend of utility and viral appeal has positioned it to challenge the dominance of both DOGE and SHIB. What sets GoodEgg (GEGG) apart is its recent game-changing announcement—the release of a groundbreaking feature that integrates AI-powered SocialFi with its Play-to-Date (P2D) model. GoodEgg (GEGG) allows users to earn rewards through dating activities, social engagement, and NFT interactions, creating a new level of utility within the meme coin sector. The hybrid Ethereum (ERC-20) project has already completed 70% of its Stage 1 presale, with tokens priced at $0.00015. The momentum surrounding GoodEgg (GEGG) has attracted the attention of both retail investors and whales, with many seeing the token as a long-term growth opportunity. GoodEgg (GEGG)’s innovative Play-to-Date model offers real-world utility that differentiates it from traditional meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). By combining blockchain technology, AI, and social interaction, GoodEgg (GEGG) is redefining what a meme coin can be and is quickly gaining ground in the competitive crypto market. The Future of Meme Coins: Who Will Come Out on Top? As we look ahead, the competition between Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and GoodEgg (GEGG) is set to intensify. Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to benefit from strong social media engagement, particularly driven by Elon Musk’s tweets and meme culture. However, its price volatility and reliance on sentiment-driven trading pose risks for investors. Shiba Inu (SHIB) offers a more resilient outlook, especially with the possibility of a SHIB ETF on the horizon. The introduction of an ETF could bring significant institutional investment, driving SHIB’s price higher. With its MVRV ratios pointing towards recovery, SHIB remains a strong contender in the meme coin race. GoodEgg (GEGG), on the other hand, is positioned to carve out a new niche in the market. Its focus on utility, through its AI-powered social platform, gives it an edge over Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which are largely driven by hype and sentiment. As GoodEgg (GEGG) continues to expand its ecosystem and attract attention from investors, it could emerge as the next big meme coin. Conclusion Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and GoodEgg (GEGG) are all vying for dominance in the meme coin market, but each token brings something different to the table. While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have the advantage of established communities and market presence, GoodEgg (GEGG) is breaking new ground with its innovative Play-to-Date model and AI integration. As meme coin season approaches, investors will be keeping a close eye on how these tokens perform. GoodEgg (GEGG)’s game-changing announcement has positioned it as a strong contender, and its unique approach to social engagement and blockchain technology could give it the edge it needs to challenge the reigning meme coin giants.

Pointing at important technical signs that suggest a positive breakout, analysts are more hopeful about the near-term potential of the coin. Fetch.ai’s success has been rather constant in spite of market uncertainty. Related Reading: Analysts Predict XRP ‘Mega Pump’ And ‘Perpetual Cycle’ – Details Cryptorphic, a well-known crypto analyst, drew attention to the recent surge of Fetch.ai, saying FET has gone up 66% since his previous analysis. This surge was inspired by a hidden divergence in the RSI, which has given more fuel for the token to continue higher. He said that if FET could overcome the resistance level around $1.35, then further upside would be seen, with the price reaching as high as $3-$4. #FET Price Update & Technical Analysis in a Weekly Timeframe FET has gained 66% since our previous post and it is currently facing 21 EMA resistance at $1.35. The hidden divergence in the RSI has played out well, and bullish momentum remains strong. Once FET breaks above this… https://t.co/AnbfgQeNA4 pic.twitter.com/5pgYsdSQ5x — Cryptorphic (@Cryptorphic1) September 11, 2024 At the time of writing, FET was trading at $1.42, up 7.7% in the last 24 hours, and sustained a 27% rally in the last week, data from Coingecko shows. FET Price Forecast And Near-Term Potential The latest price prediction from CoinCodex, which shows Fetch.ai might increase 14.37% and reach as high as $1.549 by mid-October, supports this prognosis. It does appear very consistent with the general outlook of analysts, who feel this is the right climate for the token. Although the Fear & Greed Index is reading 31, which suggests fear, Fetch.ai has still had some pretty strong momentum, posting green days 53% of the time during the last month. Another cryptocurrency researcher, Nebraskangooner, revealed on the FET price chart a significant inverse head-and- shoulders pattern. Usually seen as a positive indication, this pattern could reverse the trend should the token break through the neckline. Nebraskangooner said this might result in great upside, with FET reaching new highs should the pattern follow the expected trajectory. $FET (per request) Massive inverse head and shoulders formation here. Needs to break neckline but would have nice upside potential if able to. pic.twitter.com/orFdMKy01u — Nebraskangooner (@Nebraskangooner) September 10, 2024 Investors Watch Key Resistance Levels With the coin approaching critical resistances, traders and investors are closely watching the token. The level of $1.35 will, therefore, be an important one to watch, given the possibility of a breakout above this level to trigger buy pressures that could lead to further institutional interest. Supported by strong technical performance, Fetch.ai shows quite dramatic price fluctuations with 15.53% volatility in the previous 30 days. FET’s ability to maintain its ascent and the forecasts from CoinCodex and analysts like Cryptorphic and Nebraskooner helped build a lot of hope in its future development. Though market worry exists, general opinion of Fetch.ai is positive. Related Reading: AAVE Excites Investors With 20% Gain As Developments Roll Out A Good Investment Opportunity? With everything working in its favor, now may be the time to invest in Fetch.ai. From the bullish RSI divergence and strong technical patterns to almost consistent green days, the case is admittedly very tempting for any investor looking to make a kill from short-run gains. The potential for long-term growth is still on, with price targets between $10 and $12 if the bullish trend sustains itself. The next few days will be crucial for the future of Fetch.ai as it attempts to break key resistance points upwards. A token breakout could lead to a price rally that may very easily push Fetch.ai to new highs, making it one of the top performers in the market. Investors are carefully watching, ready to reap the rewards if Fetch.ai keeps going up.

With its upcoming launch, many are wondering whether GEGG can challenge the dominance of Pepecoin (PEPE) in terms of 24-hour trading volume. While PEPE continues to see significant whale activity, GoodEgg (GEGG) could be on the verge of a major breakout, with some analysts predicting a potential 13,000% surge. The Rise of PEPE: Whale Activity Surges In the past 24 hours, Pepecoin (PEPE) has experienced yet another surge in whale activity. According to data from IntoTheBlock, over 10.21 trillion PEPE tokens have been traded by whales, with the large transaction count jumping by more than 131%. This sudden activity has sparked renewed interest in Pepecoin (PEPE), despite a slight price drop of 3.68%, bringing the token to $0.00000718. The recent whale transactions totaled $76.3 million, with 120 transactions valued over $100,000. These whales seem to be taking advantage of Pepecoin (PEPE)’s current downtrend, convinced that the meme coin is undervalued and poised for a rally. Despite its limited use cases compared to Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other meme coins, long-term holders of Pepecoin (PEPE) believe the token still has potential. Can GoodEgg (GEGG) Challenge PEPE’s Trading Volume? While Pepecoin (PEPE) continues to attract whale investors, GoodEgg (GEGG) is emerging as a serious contender in the meme coin arena. Set to launch with its innovative Play-2-Date model and AI-powered social scoring system, GEGG offers more than just a meme coin hype—it brings utility and community-driven rewards to the table. With the buzz around GoodEgg (GEGG) growing, many are speculating whether it can match or even surpass PEPE’s 24-hour trading volume after its launch. Analysts are particularly excited about GEGG’s potential to rally by 13,000%, a prediction based on the token’s strong presale performance and its unique proposition in the crypto space. Unlike Pepecoin (PEPE), which has primarily thrived on whale activity and speculative trading, GoodEgg (GEGG) has a clear development path and ecosystem that includes real-world applications. Investors looking for long-term growth and stability may find GEGG to be a more attractive option compared to the highly volatile Pepecoin (PEPE). The Battle Between PEPE and GEGG As GoodEgg (GEGG) prepares for its official launch, the meme coin landscape is set for a major shakeup. While Pepecoin (PEPE) has captured the market’s attention with its whale-driven trading volume, GEGG offers something new and potentially more sustainable. The token’s focus on social engagement, rewards, and gamified dating features sets it apart from traditional meme coins, making it a strong candidate for long-term success. For Pepecoin (PEPE), the whales remain a driving force behind its price movement. Despite the recent dip, 49% of Pepecoin (PEPE) holders are still in profit, with another 11.11% breaking even. This has reignited interest in the token among its whale investors, who believe that Pepecoin (PEPE) is undervalued and poised for another rally. However, as GoodEgg (GEGG) enters the market, it could draw attention away from Pepecoin (PEPE). The unique utility of GEGG may attract investors who are looking for more than just speculative trading, positioning it as a strong contender in the meme coin market. Conclusion The meme coin market is as dynamic as ever, with both Pepecoin (PEPE) and GoodEgg (GEGG) vying for investor attention. While Pepecoin (PEPE) continues to benefit from whale activity, GoodEgg (GEGG) is set to make a splash with its innovative features and potential for massive gains. As both coins move forward, investors will need to keep a close eye on the market, as GEGG could very well challenge PEPE’s dominance in the coming weeks.

42417250,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXkFx,1726148663,"CFTC Has No Authority to Second-Guess Election Contracts, Judge Says","The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission didn't have the authority to ""conduct a public interest review"" that led it to block Kalshiex from listing political prediction markets in the U.S., a federal judge said in a formal opinion Thursday..  Judge Jia Cobb, of the District of Columbia, published her long-anticipated opinion nearly a week after ruling in Kalshi's favor in its lawsuit against the CFTC. The judge wrote that Congress had revoked the CFTC's ability to conduct public interest reviews of certain proposed derivative contracts, unless they fit within certain buckets, like terrorism or gaming.  The opinion may have implications for the CFTC's pending proposal to ban all exchanges on its watch from listing political prediction markets, .  ""The district court's opinion and conclusions do appear to conflict with the CFTC's proposed rule, including with respect to the proper definition of 'gaming,'"" said Daniel Gorfine, an adjunct law professor at Georgetown University and a former chief innovation officer at the agency.  ""The court takes a far narrower interpretation than the CFTC does in its Kalshi order and proposed rule,"" Gorfine said. ""It is accordingly hard to see how the proposed rule would square with the court's reasoning.""  Although Kalshi won the case, it remains unclear how soon the company can list election markets. The CFTC has filed an emergency motion asking the judge to stay her order while the agency figures out whether to appeal. A hearing on that motion is scheduled to take place Thursday at 10:30 a.m. Eastern time (14:30 UTC).  Read more:U.S. Election Betting: What's at Stake in Final (?) CFTC-Kalshi Showdown  The CFTC has argued for several months now that political prediction markets fall under the ""gaming"" category, including in its proposal to ban them in the U.S. outright. In the Kalshi case, the judge disagreed.  ""The CFTC’s order exceeded its statutory authority. Kalshi’s contracts do not involve unlawful activity or gaming,"" the judge wrote. ""They involve elections, which are neither.""  The judge cited the Supreme Court's Loper Bright ruling that overturned the previous Chevron deference precedent, in explaining how she came by her order.  Much of the judge's ruling walks through how she interpreted Congress's intent in modifying the Commodity Exchange Act, including how it and the CFTC defined words like ""involves"" and ""gaming.""  The CFTC defined ""gaming"" as something that could include ""gambling,"" which in turn involves making wagers, the judge noted.  But, this logic could let the CFTC review any event contract where people put money on an outcome, which the Commodity Exchange Act already prevents it from doing, the judge said.  Judge Cobb said Kalshi's proposed contracts – which would let users take positions on which major political party might control each house of Congress at a given time – do not involve ""unlawful activity or gaming,"" which alone is sufficient to overturn the CFTC's rejection of Kalshi's contracts – and the judge can't consider if there's a public interest angle as a result.  ""That question involves (relates to, entails, has as its essential feature, or any other iteration of the word) elections, politics, Congress, and party control; but nothing that any Party to this litigation has identified as illegal or unlawful activity,"" the judge wrote. ""Nor does that question bear any relation to any game – played for stakes or otherwise.""  She emphasized that this decision was based on law, not policy preferences.  ""Although the Court acknowledges the CFTC’s concern that allowing the public to trade on the outcome of elections threatens the public interest, this Court has no occasion to consider that argument,"" the judge wrote. ""This case is not about whether the Court likes Kalshi’s product or thinks trading it is a good idea. The Court’s only task is to determine what Congress did, not what it could do or should do. And Congress did not authorize the CFTC to conduct the public interest review it conducted here.""  Whether or not the CFTC appeals this case or finalizes its proposed rule, it may find other ways to stymie political prediction markets, which its hairman Rostin Benham has said would put the agency the untenable position of becoming an election cop.  ""It is worth noting that the CFTC has additional authority it could invoke to create new rules around contracts that involve activities that are 'similar' to the enumerated list of activities the Commission can find to be against the public interest,"" said Gorfine, who is also the founder of Gattaca Horizons LLC, an advisory firm. ""Of course, that would take time and be subject to potential challenge.""

Positions in coins which are redeemable to the eToro crypto wallet can remain as open positions, so no action is required for these assets, the spokesperson added.  “This settlement allows us to move forward and focus on providing innovative and relevant products across our diversified U.S. business,"" Yoni Assia, eToro’s Co-founder and CEO told CoinDesk in an earlier press release.  The SEC’s order found that since at least 2020, eToro – which didn't admit or deny wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement – let U.S. customers trade crypto assets being offered and sold as securities and ""did not comply with the registration provisions of the federal securities laws,"" the release said.  The eToro case notably doesn't specify what tokens the company was handling that it considers securities. The agency has done so in several past matters, but it hasn't offered a formal, crypto-specific definition for what tokens stray into the SEC's jurisdiction – the primary point of legal contention between the regulator and the industry.  The SEC has been clamping down on crypto firms that it argues have violated securities laws. It recently was granted a limited win in its several-years-long case against crypto platform Ripple that dates back to 2020.  In August, a federal judge ruled that Ripple should pay $125 million after finding that the company violated federal securities laws with its direct sales of XRP to institutional clients. But this was a fraction of the $2 billion that the SEC initially sought.  The SEC also brought an enforcement action against crypto exchange Coinbase Inc. (COIN) for ""alleging that Coinbase intermediated transactions in crypto-asset securities on its trading platform and through related services, all in violation of the federal securities laws."" The court sided with the SEC, according to a filing in March.  In 2023 the SEC also sued another large exchange, Binance, for violating securities laws, and the decision led to Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao stepping down after pleading guilty to criminal charges and Richard Teng replacing him.  ETH remains a point of dispute, with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and most of the crypto industry arguing it's a commodity while the SEC declines to say either way, though at least one SEC-registered broker dealer has begun a custody operation that treats it as a security.  ""We now have a clear regulatory framework for crypto assets in our home markets of the U.K. and Europe and we believe we will see similar in the U.S. in the near future,"" Assia added. ""Once this is in place, we will look to enable trading in the crypto assets that meet this framework.”  Read more: What's Next in SEC v. Ripple?  Jesse Hamilton contributed to reporting.

42417245,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXkI1,1726146161,Build-on-Bitcoin Trend Imports Another Concept from Ethereum: the DAO,"RootstockCollective has been unveiled as the first DAO on Bitcoin layer-2 Rootstock.  The DAO will allow holders of Rootstock token RIF to earn voting rights through staking their tokens.  NFTs arrived on Bitcoin last year. Then fungible tokens came to the oldest and largest blockchain – along with dozens of new layer-2 networks, and staking projects, too.  Now, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) has been unveiled on Bitcoin layer 2 Rootstock, continuing the trend of concepts more commonly associated with the likes of Ethereum finding their way to the world's oldest blockchain.  RootstockCollective, the first DAO on the Bitcoin layer 2, is designed to encourage builders and users of Rootstock, according to an emailed announcement shared with CoinDesk on Thursday.  DAOs are blockchain-based organizations in which decisions are taken by holders of its underlying token rather than any central authority. Like many facets of the blockchain landscape, they reside on networks like Ethereum and Solana but have been absent from Bitcoin due to constraints over its programmability.  Rootstock is one of a number of layer-2 networks seeking to enable greater utility to Bitcoin, and it's compatible with Ethereum's EVM programming standard for smart contracts, – theoretically allowing applications originally built on Ethereum or affiliated chains to be easily ported over.  The so-called build-on-Bitcoin trend first came to prominence in early 2023 with the Ordinals protocol, which introduced a Bitcoin version of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This has since continued with the provision for memecoins and other fungible tokens on the Runes protocol, while the BitVM computing paradigm has opened the door to facilitating smart contracts on Bitcoin.  The RootstockCollective DAO will allow holders of the Rootstock token RIF to earn voting rights through staking their tokens. Staking refers to users locking away their tokens to participate in the verification process on a blockchain and receiving more tokens as a reward.

While Ethereum (ETH) has long been a dominant force in the blockchain world, Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its meme appeal and integration into decentralized finance (DeFi), is catching the attention of investors. Let’s dive into the profit predictions for these two coins as analysts forecast their performance for 2024, 2030, and 2035. Ethereum’s Steady Climb to 2024: What Can Investors Expect? Ethereum (ETH), a stable and reliable blockchain network, is expected to grow significantly by 2024 due to advancements in its network, including the full deployment of Ethereum (ETH) 2.0. As it integrates decentralized applications and smart contracts, analysts predict Ethereum (ETH) could reach a value of $4,500. However, investors seeking faster growth may consider newer projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE). Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Explosive Growth for 2024: Can It Outperform Ethereum? Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a new meme coin with potential beyond its meme status. It incorporates DeFi elements like yield farming and liquidity mining, offering investors additional rewards. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s gaming and sports betting platform attracts crypto enthusiasts. Analysts predict a surge in user adoption, particularly among younger investors, and its integration with decentralized finance and gaming applications could make it a high-growth alternative to Ethereum (ETH) by the end of 2024. Ethereum’s 2030 Prediction: A Stalwart in Blockchain Innovation Ethereum (ETH)’s future evolution will focus on sustainability and wider adoption in enterprise use cases, solidifying its dominance as the go-to platform for smart contracts. By 2030, ETH is projected to reach $15,000 due to widespread use of decentralized applications and tokens. Investors seeking long-term stability and steady growth may find Ethereum (ETH) a suitable choice. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s 2030 Forecast: The Meme Coin That Became Mainstream Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a thriving ecosystem with gaming and betting opportunities, expected to grow significantly by 2030. Its utility and community-driven model, integrated with DeFi protocols like staking and liquidity mining, ensures holders continue to earn rewards. Analysts predict Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s price of $2.50 by 2030 due to viral marketing, user base, and strong DeFi backbone. Ethereum 2035: The Foundation of the Decentralized World By 2035, Ethereum (ETH) could become the backbone of the decentralized web, hosting thousands of applications and tokens.

Despite this, a few standout projects like Helium (HNT) and the emerging meme coin Mpeppe (MPEPE) continue to show strong growth potential. As we look towards the future, experts are making bold predictions about the price trajectories of these two assets in 2025, 2030, and 2035, forecasting massive rallies that could bring significant returns to investors. Helium (HNT) – The IoT Network with Long-Term Growth Helium (HNT) has consistently shown resilience in a turbulent market. As of September 2024, the decentralized wireless network, designed specifically for the Internet of Things (IoT), has seen a 26% increase in value over the past week, bringing its price to $8.48—its highest value in six months. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, Helium (HNT)’s fundamentals are strong, driven by its growing network of IoT devices and partnerships with major telecommunications companies. Helium Price Prediction for 2025 Experts predict that Helium (HNT)’s steady network expansion will fuel its price growth over the coming years. By 2025, the value of HNT could soar to $35, a significant increase from its current price. The growing adoption of IoT technology is expected to be a major driver of this growth, as more devices rely on Helium (HNT)’s decentralized network for low-cost, long-range data transmission. Helium Price Prediction for 2030 Looking further ahead, analysts foresee Helium (HNT)’s price reaching as high as $90 by 2030. This surge is likely to be driven by the widespread adoption of IoT across industries, as Helium (HNT) becomes an integral part of smart cities, logistics, and healthcare systems. The project’s ability to reduce energy consumption while enabling large-scale communication will continue to make it a valuable asset in the technology space. Helium Price Prediction for 2035 By 2035, some experts predict that Helium (HNT) could break the $200 barrier, offering early investors a potential return of over 1500% from today’s price. The growth of decentralized wireless networks and increased demand for IoT connectivity are expected to drive this long-term surge, making Helium (HNT) a key player in the future of technology. Mpeppe (MPEPE) – The Rising Star of Meme Coins While Helium (HNT) is known for its practical utility, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly gaining attention as one of the most exciting new meme coins in the market. Despite being a meme coin, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has positioned itself as a serious contender with real-world utility, combining the playful aspects of meme culture with decentralized finance (DeFi) and social platforms. As of September 2024, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is in the fourth stage of its presale, with 80% of tokens already sold. The token is currently priced at 0.0021 USDT, but analysts are optimistic about its future performance, predicting massive gains over the next decade. Mpeppe Price Prediction for 2025 By 2025, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is expected to see a significant surge in value, with prices potentially reaching $0.03. The coin’s unique combination of community-driven initiatives, DeFi features, and its appeal to both crypto investors and meme enthusiasts is likely to drive demand. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s strong presale performance and growing community suggest that it could be one of the standout performers in the meme coin space. Mpeppe Price Prediction for 2030 Looking ahead to 2030, Mpeppe (MPEPE) could see its value skyrocket even further. Some analysts predict that the token could reach $0.15 by this time, representing a potential return of over 7000% from its presale price. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Mpeppe’s playful yet innovative approach could solidify its place as a top meme coin with real-world utility. Mpeppe Price Prediction for 2035 By 2035, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is expected to become a well-established player in the meme coin market, with its value potentially climbing to $0.50. If this prediction holds true, early investors could see returns of over 23,000%, making Mpeppe (MPEPE) one of the most successful meme coins in history. Its strong community backing, combined with innovative features and partnerships, will be key factors driving its long-term success. The Future of Helium and Mpeppe: Two Distinct Paths to Success While Helium (HNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) operate in very different spaces, both tokens offer compelling investment opportunities for those looking to capitalize on future market trends. Helium (HNT)’s focus on IoT technology and decentralized networks makes it a strong contender for long-term growth, particularly as more industries adopt IoT solutions. Meanwhile, Mpeppe’s playful approach to cryptocurrency, combined with its unique DeFi features, positions it as a rising star in the meme coin market. As we move towards 2025, 2030, and beyond, these two projects are expected to thrive, each in their own way. Whether you’re looking for a utility-driven token like Helium (HNT) or a high-potential meme coin like Mpeppe (MPEPE), both offer the chance for significant returns in the years to come.

The only federally chartered crypto bank in the U.S., Anchorage Digital is servicing one of the leading ETFs in a custody space that's been otherwise dominated by Coinbase.  The first and only U.S. federally chartered crypto bank, Anchorage Digital, is taking on the custody role for a leading issuer of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), 21Shares, the companies said in a Thursday statement, which noted that BitGo will also partner with the issuers as a custodian.  That custody extends to ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), which is behind only BlackRock and Fidelity's ETFs as the third biggest for inflows, according to a ranking maintained by Farside Investors, and to 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETH). Cathie Wood's ARK Invest partnered with 21Shares on the bitcoin ETF.  “21Shares is thrilled to be working with Anchorage Digital Bank and BitGo to diversify our custodians for our US spot ETPs,"" said Andres Valencia, head of investment management at 21Shares, in a statement. ""We consider our custody partners to be crucial to the risk management and operational excellence of our product lineup, and diversification adds to the safety and security of our offering.""  21Shares isn't the first issuers to diversify it's custody arrangements. For instance, earlier this year, Valkyrie added BitGo as another custody provider for its Bitcoin Fund (BRRR).  ""Anchorage Digital Bank N.A. is pleased to further broaden access to crypto as a custodian selected for 21Shares’ U.S. spot ETF lineup,"" said Nathan McCauley, the bank's co-founder and CEO, in a statement. ""Our federal charter — which supersedes state-by-state regulation and positions us as a qualified custodian — makes us a natural choice for ETF custody diversification.""  Read More: VanEck, 21Shares Solana ETF Plan Confirmed in Cboe Filing  The establishment of crypto ETFs was aimed at giving a wider field of investors easier access to regulated products wrapped around the cryptocurrencies that had previously been more difficult to trade. Custody is a hefty responsibility for the outside firms that maintain safekeeping of billions in assets backing the products.  To date, Coinbase has been a leader in custody services for the U.S.'s exchange traded products (ETPs) – the wider universe that includes ETFs.  Anchorage Digital touted its legally required segregation of assets as a bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, shielding such assets from the bankruptcy dangers seen in the recent past with the failure of crypto firms. It also said it's using ""industry-leading security and novel technology"" to protect assets, including biometric authentication and offline private-key storage.  Custody has become an increasingly thorny problem in the crypto sector. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has pursued a proposed rule requiring registered investment advisers to keep clients' crypto assets with so-called ""qualified custodians."" If the narrow definition pushed by SEC Chair Gary Gensler prevails, only a short list of firms inside the industry may qualify, including Anchorage Digital as a bank and such registered broker dealers as Prometheum Inc. and tZero Group Inc.

This comes with a jump in positive sentiment associated with the DeFi token, enabling bulls to reclaim control of the price once more. With this positive sentiment proliferating for the AAVE price, a pseudonymous crypto analyst who goes by Persis10t on TradingView has forecasted a rather bullish future for the cryptocurrency. AAVE Breaks Out Of Triangle Pattern According to the analysis shared by the crypto analyst on the TradingView website, the AAVE price had been trading inside a triangle pattern. This can be bearish for the price, given that triangle patterns tend to keep prices constrained to a tight range. However, the good news is that the AAVE price has now broken out of this triangle pattern. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Retesting $57,000 Is Good For The Price This breakout signals the rise in momentum that has been pushing the price. Furthermore, it suggests that the AAVE price is ready to push upward with the rally. Despite the fact that the DeFi token has fallen back to retest its breakout level, the crypto analyst believes that this is a good thing and a positive sign for the cryptocurrency. Other factors that support the bullishness include the fact that the AAVE price is being supported by the 100-day Moving Average on the weekly timeframe. This suggests bullishness both in the short and mid-term. Also, the notable rise in its 24-hour trading volume, which has remained consistent over the last few days, lends credence to this bullish narrative. Last but not least on the list of bullish developments is a crossover on the 50-Day and 100-Day Moving Average. As the crypto analyst explains, this crossover is something that could fuel the AAVE price from here, helping it sustain its rally. How Far Can The Price Go? When it comes to how far the AAVE price can rise from here, the crypto analyst is incredibly optimistic about the future of cryptocurrency. While AAVE is currently trending around $150, the analyst believes that it is destined for four digits soon. Related Reading: End Of The Road For NEIRO? Crypto Analyst Predicts Breakdown Below $0.13 The chart shows that there will be corrections along the way, but ultimately expects it to breach the $1,000 level. At the very top of the rally, the crypto analyst puts the price at $2,516, which would be a 1,710% increase from its current price. At the time of writing, the AAVE price is sitting at $151 after climbing 0.5% in the last day. Likewise, its daily trading volume is seeing a small uptick of 0.7%, putting it at $394.5 million.

42417257,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXkPF,1726142627,Mining New Bitcoin Is More Difficult Than Ever. Here's How it Could Impact BTC Prices,"The difficulty of mining bitcoin has reached an all-time high of 92.6 terahashes, increasing by over 10% since early July, which could strain miners' profitability due to higher operational costs.  Increased mining difficulty might pressure miners financially, potentially leading to more bitcoin being sold to cover costs. However, some say there's no direct correlation between mining difficulty and bitcoin price.  The next bitcoin difficulty adjustment is estimated to occur on Sept. 27, decreasing the bitcoin mining difficulty to 77.12 T, as per Coinwarz.  The computational power required to bring new bitcoin {{BTC}} into existence has surged to a fresh lifetime high in a move that could spell trouble for miners and impact prices.  Mining difficulty hit 92.6 terahashes late on Wednesday, Coinwarz data shows, rising by four units in a month and more than 10% since early July.  Difficulty (denoted by terahashes) measures the computation power used to process blocks on a proof-of-work blockchain, such as bitcoin, broadly referring to how and time-consuming it is to find the right hash for each block. Entities, often referred to as miners, use extensive computing systems to mine blocks and are rewarded with bitcoin - which is sold on the open market to cover costs and turn a profit.  The network automatically adjusts the difficulty of mining new blocks to the blockchain every 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks. This is based on the number of miners and their combined hashpower - which measures how much computing power a network uses.  The next bitcoin difficulty adjustment is estimated to occur on Sept. 27, decreasing the bitcoin mining difficulty from 92.67 T to 77.12 T, as per Coinwarz.  A bump in mining difficulty can dampen profits for bitcoin mining companies as costs required to keep operations going significantly increase - straining an already difficult environment for such firms.  “Revenue has been under pressure for many mining firms post-halving,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message Thursday. “We believe, however, that the recent selling pressure is primarily from trading stopouts and ETF outflows.”  Some traders, meanwhile, say bitcoin price action could be impacted based on general market conditions and how miners deal with the difficulty increase.  “There is no clear cause-and-effect relation between mining difficulty and BTC price. Higher mining difficulty will indeed cause stress on the miners' but how they react to such stress is up to individual miners,” Peter Chung, head of research at Presto, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  “Over the long-run, miners deal with rising difficulty levels by upgrading the equipment and/or pursuing other cost rationalization measures (e.g. seeking cheaper electricity cost, etc). Historically, when you average it out, BTC price showed no meaningful correlation with this particular variable,” Chung said.  Presto research analyst Min Jung, however, said that selling pressure could be on the cards based on overall market sentiment.  “If equities weaken and the overall financial markets show signs of weakness, it could lead to selling pressure, driven by the belief that it is better to take a loss now than later,” Jung said in a message.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/12/mining-new-bitcoin-is-more-difficult-than-ever-heres-how-it-could-impact-btc-prices,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b5686ecbc02372f344a8692053ee3d3926c02fe-1420x799.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417260,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXkRJ,1726142460,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Tops $58K After U.S. Tech Stocks Rise,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,831.41 +2.21%  Bitcoin (BTC): $58,088.29 +2.45%  Ether (ETH): $2,345.28 +0.99%  S&P 500: 5,554.13 +1.07%  Gold: $2,515.67 +0.11%  Nikkei 225: 36,833.27 +3.41%  Top Stories  Bitcoin rose above $58,000 on the back of a rally in U.S. technology stocks. U.S. inflation data on Wednesday seemed to solidify the prospect of a 25 basis-point interest-rate cut by the Fed this month, following which Nvidia, Microsoft, Google and Apple all registered gains. BTC is currently priced just above $58,000, 2.4% higher in the last 24 hours, while the broader crypto market has risen about 2.2%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index. However, bitcoin ETFs' inflow streak was halted after just two days, registering outflows of $43 million on Wednesday.  Leverage in the bitcoin market is increasing again, suggesting traders are looking to take on more risk. The estimated leverage ratio, which divides global futures open interest by the number of coins held on exchanges, jumped to 0.2060, the highest since October 2023, according to CryptoQuant. There was previously a months-long consolidation below 0.2, suggesting a more cautious approach. The increase indicates there is potentially more volatility being injected into the market. High-leverage liquidity is stacked at around $58,500, according to Hyblock Capital. So volatility could pick up once BTC approaches that level, especially because overall market liquidity remains low. That means a buy/sell order can have an outsized impact on the going market rate.  DeFi platform Pendle has started offering pools with variable yields of as high as 45% on a bitcoin-backed token in a move that expands the product’s fundamentals. The offering, which can also provide fixed yields of an annualized 10%, allows users to deposit LBTC, a liquid-staking token issued by restaking startup Lombard, in a Pendle pool made by Ethereum layer-2 network Corn. Data shows the pool has attracted over $13 million in user deposits since going live. It matures on Dec. 26. Lombard is a restaking service that converts wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) to a Lombard Bitcoin (LBTC) token that can be used in DeFi applications to capture yield. Corn, another startup, is a network that uses bitcoin as the main token to pay usage fees.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows prices for Binance-listed bitcoin perpetual futures and the global bid-ask ratio.  The recent price drop has been characterized by a positive global bid-ask ratio, represented by the vertical green lines.  ""It shows the underlying demand remains robust, positioning the market for a potential rebound,"" Hyblock Capital said.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  U.S. Consumers Say Crypto Is Here to Stay, Stablecoins Maybe Not: Deutsche Bank  Are Ethereum Staking Yields Too High?

Recently, GoodEgg (GEGG) has captured the attention of whales and early investors, drawing comparisons to the rise of Sui (SUI), which has been experiencing consistent growth. However, GoodEgg’s 180% presale gains have left Sui’s recent 20% rally in the dust, positioning the AI-powered social coin as a significant player in the crypto space. Sui (SUI) Fights for Market Dominance Sui (SUI) is currently making waves in the cryptocurrency world. While its growth has been steady, with a 2x increase in price this year, Sui’s climb has recently stalled. It remains one of the few development platform blockchains outside of the top 10 tokens to maintain a dedicated user base. Despite this, Sui’s current price is still underwater from its 2023 ICO, limiting its chances for a major breakout. Still, Sui’s 20% recent gain in the market is noteworthy, and investors are cautiously optimistic about its potential to break into the top 30 tokens by market capitalization this year. Analysts predict that the token could reach key psychological thresholds if market conditions improve, but for now, its upward momentum seems capped. Nevertheless, Sui’s resilience in a volatile market continues to attract attention, especially from long-term investors. GoodEgg (GEGG): Outpacing SUI’s Growth In contrast, GoodEgg (GEGG) has quickly surged ahead, capturing a loyal following of investors. The project’s AI-driven “Social Scoring” and “Play 2 Date” model set it apart from traditional meme coins like Dogecoin. GoodEgg’s presale has already completed 80% of Stage 1, and whales have jumped in, anticipating up to 100x returns from its current price of $0.00015. The innovative approach of GoodEgg (GEGG), which merges blockchain technology with virtual dating and gamified social experiences, is reshaping the meme coin sector. This has attracted the attention of investors who were initially focused on Sui (SUI), prompting them to diversify into the GoodEgg ecosystem. While Sui struggles to maintain momentum, GoodEgg’s potential seems limitless as it continues to attract both retail and institutional investors. Sui (SUI) vs. GoodEgg (GEGG): A Market Comparison Sui (SUI) has carved out a niche in the development platform blockchain sector, holding its own against competitors like Ethereum and Solana. Despite some setbacks, Sui’s market cap of $2.49 billion keeps it within reach of significant gains if market sentiment shifts in its favor. However, Sui has yet to fully capitalize on the growing interest in AI and Social-Fi, areas where GoodEgg (GEGG) is making strides. GoodEgg (GEGG), on the other hand, has tapped into the market’s thirst for innovation with its AI-powered dating app and social scoring system. Investors are drawn to the utility that GoodEgg (GEGG) offers beyond speculation, creating a buzz that Sui (SUI) has yet to achieve in the same timeframe. GoodEgg’s unique blend of entertainment, social interaction, and financial rewards positions it as a top contender in the evolving meme and AI crypto market. Conclusion While Sui (SUI) continues to fight for a place among the top 30 cryptocurrencies, GoodEgg (GEGG) is blazing a trail with its AI-driven meme coin model. Investors are increasingly turning their attention to GoodEgg (GEGG), leaving Sui in the rearview mirror as they seek the next big opportunity in the crypto space. With whales backing its presale and a strong community forming around its innovative approach, GoodEgg (GEGG) is poised to revolutionize the meme coin market, potentially eclipsing the steady, yet slower, rise of Sui (SUI). As the crypto market continues to evolve, both Sui (SUI) and GoodEgg (GEGG) represent different facets of innovation. However, GoodEgg’s rapid growth and appeal to whales signal that it could outpace its competition, making it one of the most exciting projects to watch in 2024.

Floki Inu (FLOKI), a popular dog-themed meme coin, made headlines with its latest 6.16% surge, largely driven by the introduction of its new Floki Trading Bot. However, despite this positive development, a new player, GoodEgg (GEGG), is drawing attention away from Floki with its innovative Play-2-Date platform. GoodEgg’s unique hybrid concept is attracting whales and early investors, as its presale sets the stage for explosive growth. Floki Inu (FLOKI) Launches Trading Bot Floki Inu (FLOKI) recently launched its own trading bot, a tool designed to automate crypto trading across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum (ETH), Binance (BNB), and Base. This trading bot provides traders with faster transactions and reduced slippage, addressing some of the inefficiencies of traditional decentralized exchanges (DEXs). By offering a seamless, secure, and quick trading environment, Floki Inu (FLOKI) has created a valuable tool for its community. One of the standout features of the Floki Trading Bot is its deflationary mechanism. Every trade incurs a 1% fee, a portion of which is used to buy and burn Floki Inu (FLOKI) tokens, reducing the circulating supply. This deflationary action is expected to increase the value of the token over time. Additionally, the remaining fees are transferred to the project’s treasury, supporting ecosystem growth and future developments. While Floki Inu (FLOKI) continues to innovate, with upcoming features such as Solana integration, sniper mode, and limit orders, its recent 6.16% surge may not be enough to outshine the explosive growth potential of GoodEgg (GEGG). GoodEgg (GEGG) Gaining Momentum with Play-2-Date Concept GoodEgg (GEGG) is positioning itself as the next big thing in the meme coin space, with a Play-2-Date platform that combines cryptocurrency, social interaction, and gaming. The platform allows users to engage in dating activities, unlocking NFTs, and earning $GEGG tokens as they participate in the ecosystem. This unique blend of social-fi and DeFi creates a fresh experience for users and has quickly garnered attention from investors. The GoodEgg platform is built on an Ethereum (ERC20) layer-2 solution, ensuring scalability and low transaction fees. With a maximum supply of 30 billion $GEGG tokens, the project is strategically designed to fuel its entire ecosystem, which includes staking, social scoring, and gamified interactions. Unlike many meme coins that rely on hype, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers real-world utility. The platform’s AI-powered dating app is set to revolutionize how people connect, ensuring safer and more transparent dating experiences. The app leverages AI technology to verify users, making dating in the digital age safer and more enjoyable. Floki Inu’s (FLOKI) Gains vs. GoodEgg’s (GEGG) Growth Potential While Floki Inu’s (FLOKI) trading bot and deflationary model have provided a recent boost, it pales in comparison to GoodEgg’s potential. GoodEgg (GEGG) has already gained substantial interest in its presale, with whales preparing for what they anticipate could be 100x returns. The presale has reached 60% of its goal, with investors eager to capitalize on its unique offering. GoodEgg’s Play-2-Date model brings a new level of engagement to the meme coin market, making it a disruptive force in both the crypto and social-fi spaces. By combining the best elements of gaming, dating, and decentralized finance, GoodEgg (GEGG) is attracting a diverse group of investors, including those who previously focused on tokens like Floki Inu (FLOKI). Conclusion: A New Contender for Meme Coin Dominance Floki Inu (FLOKI) may have made strides with its trading bot and recent price surge, but GoodEgg (GEGG) is quickly outpacing its growth with a unique concept and promising utility. The Play-2-Date platform is poised to become a game-changer in both the dating and cryptocurrency landscapes. As whales and investors flock to GoodEgg, it’s clear that this hybrid meme token is set to eclipse Floki Inu’s (FLOKI) gains, offering a new vision for the future of social-fi and decentralized dating.

Over the last 24 hours, trading volume for Sui (SUI) has risen by 9%, signaling renewed investor interest and potential for a return to positive momentum. If Sui (SUI) continues its upward trajectory, it could soon break through the critical psychological level of $1, solidifying its position as a top performer this quarter.

GoodEgg (GEGG): A Meme Coin with Real Utility While Sui (SUI) is building momentum through its technological advancements, GoodEgg (GEGG) is shaking up the meme coin space with its unique blend of artificial intelligence and social finance.

Sui (SUI) continues to build on its reputation as a highly efficient Layer 1 blockchain with the potential to surpass $1 in the coming weeks.

Investor Outlook: Diversification Is Key For investors looking to maximize gains in September, both Sui (SUI) and GoodEgg (GEGG) offer compelling opportunities. While Sui (SUI) is favored for its strong technical foundation and potential to break through key resistance levels, GoodEgg (GEGG) is attracting attention due to its innovative use of AI and real-world utility.

33503439,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641455,1726142439,"Floki and GoodEgg Price Prediction – October November December 2024, GEGG Dominates Meme Arena","As the year heads into its final quarter, meme coins are back in the spotlight. Floki (FLOKI) has held its ground as one of the major players in the memecoin world, while a new contender, GoodEgg (GEGG), is quickly gaining attention. With the meme market buzzing, analysts are offering predictions for both Floki and GoodEgg, and GoodEgg (GEGG) seems to be taking center stage as a new favorite. Floki (FLOKI) Consolidates for a Potential Breakout Floki (FLOKI) has been making waves in the memecoin arena and is currently showing promising signs of growth. Floki is consolidating above a key support level at $0.0001, trading within a symmetrical triangle pattern. Many traders are closely watching the FLOKI/USDT pair, expecting a sharp breakout if the coin manages to break through its resistance levels. Since March, Floki (FLOKI) has been in a consolidation phase, even as many other coins have experienced corrections. A breakout from the current pattern could see Floki rise rapidly, while a failure to hold support might prompt investors to reevaluate their positions. Adding to the excitement, Floki holders are set to receive CAT tokens in an airdrop through Binance and OKX, further fueling optimism. With 71% of FLOKI holders currently in profit and whales controlling 86% of the supply, the community is bracing for a potential surge. However, as new players like GoodEgg (GEGG) enter the scene, the memecoin market is becoming increasingly competitive. GoodEgg (GEGG) Emerges as a Major Player GoodEgg (GEGG) is gaining traction and quickly carving out a significant space in the memecoin market. Unlike traditional meme tokens, GoodEgg offers more than speculative value. The hybrid token combines elements of Social-Fi, Play-2-Date, and AI technology, positioning it as a unique and practical cryptocurrency. GoodEgg (GEGG) allows users to earn tokens by participating in a gamified dating ecosystem. This innovative approach has attracted a wide array of investors, including those who have traditionally supported meme coins like Floki (FLOKI). The token’s Stage 1 presale is already 70% complete, with a price set at $0.00015, making it an attractive entry point for those looking to get in early. Unlike other meme tokens that rely heavily on social sentiment, GoodEgg (GEGG) provides real-world applications, which have helped it stand out. By blending blockchain technology with online dating and virtual interaction, GoodEgg offers a secure and transparent platform for users to connect. This combination of utility and innovation sets it apart from competitors like Floki (FLOKI), and analysts are predicting that GoodEgg could dominate the meme arena in the final months of 2024. Predictions for Q4: GEGG vs. FLOKI Looking ahead to October, November, and December 2024, both Floki (FLOKI) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are expected to see significant price movements, but with different drivers. Floki (FLOKI) is currently poised for a potential breakout, especially if it can break through key resistance levels. With the memecoin season in full swing and a CAT token airdrop on the horizon, Floki’s price could see a strong upward move if whale activity increases. However, the coin still faces challenges, particularly with its price struggling to break above the 50-day EMA. GoodEgg (GEGG), on the other hand, has been steadily gaining momentum thanks to its innovative approach and practical applications. With the completion of 70% of its presale, GoodEgg is already proving to be a strong contender in the meme market. Investors are drawn to its long-term potential and real-world utility, making it a favorite among both new and experienced crypto enthusiasts. While Floki (FLOKI) has the benefit of strong community support and whale activity, GoodEgg (GEGG) is emerging as a dominant force with a solid foundation for growth. As the final quarter of 2024 unfolds, it’s clear that GoodEgg (GEGG) is poised to lead the meme coin sector into the next phase of its evolution. Conclusion As we enter the final months of 2024, both Floki (FLOKI) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are gearing up for significant price movements. Floki is showing promising signs of a breakout, supported by strong whale activity and the upcoming CAT token airdrop. However, GoodEgg (GEGG) is quickly dominating the meme coin space with its hybrid model that combines Social-Fi, Play-2-Date, and AI-driven technology. Investors looking for growth in the meme coin market should keep a close eye on both Floki and GoodEgg, but with GoodEgg’s innovative approach and strong presale performance, it may very well dominate the meme arena in the months to come.

42417259,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXkL7,1726142400,U.S. Election Betting: What's at Stake in Final (?) CFTC-Kalshi Showdown,"Thursday could be a pivotal day for political prediction markets, a former niche industry that's seen explosive growth in this U.S. election year.  At 10:30 a.m. Eastern time (14:30 UTC), Judge Jia M. Cobb of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will hear arguments over an emergency motion by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commision.  Last week the CFTC lost the case filed by Kalshi, a prediction market that sued the regulator for barring it from listing contracts on which party will control each chamber of Congress after the election.  In its emergency motion, the CFTC asked Cobb to make Kalshi wait at least another two weeks before listing its election markets. The judge had yet to publish an opinion explaining her rationale for ruling in Kalshi's favor, and the regulator argued that until it has this information it can't make an informed decision on whether to appeal. (The opinion dropped Thursday just before this article was published.)  Cobb granted a stay, but only through the end of Thursday's hearing. Depending on how the hearing goes, Kalshi might be cleared to launch its election markets as soon as Friday. But the judge could also make the firm wait until at least a few days after she issues her opinion.  If that happens, and the CFTC then decides to appeal, the judge or the appeals court could conceivably grant another stay pending the outcome of that appeal. Which could take as long as a year – meaning Kalshi wouldn't be able to take advantage of the 2024 political betting fever in the last two months before the election. (An appeal wouldn't automatically generate a stay.)  All this is happening as the CFTC considers a proposed rule to prohibit election contracts at all the exchanges on its watch.  ""Door number one is … we see regulated political prediction markets,"" said Koleman Strumpf, an economics professor at Wake Forest University in North Carolina who has studied the centuries-long history of election betting in the U.S. ""Door number two is … we're back in this kind of strange limbo.""  Proponents of prediction markets argue they have spillover benefits to the general public, by revealing what true experts with skin in the game actually think is going to happen, rather than the pompous prognostications of pusillanimous pundits.  ""Participants are financially incented to provide accurate predictions, regardless of personal biassince correct predictions lead to profits, while incorrect predictions result in losses,"" wrote Will Ogden Moore, who leads research and product at Grayscale Investments, in a client note Wednesday.  'Huge demand'  Kalshi lists markets on a variety of event outcomes, ranging from Taylor Swift's album sales to the wind speed of Hurricane Francine, but nothing right now about election results.  At the moment, the only company that can legally operate political prediction markets in the U.S. is PredictIt, which operates under a narrow regulatory exemption. It, too, took the CFTC to court last year, after the regulator tried to shut it down.  But the dearth of regulated venues in the U.S. has not constrained political betting.  Polymarket, which is barred from the U.S. under a CFTC settlement, has been the main beneficiary of this year's boom, with $875 million worth of cryptocurrency bet in a smart contract on the presidential election as of Wednesday afternoon. (Unlike PredictIt and Kalshi, which settle trades in dollars, Polymarket's bets are denominated in USDC, a dollar-linked token, or stablecoin.)  ""There's no future where we don't have political prediction markets,"" Strumpf said. ""Supply rises to meet demand. There's huge demand for this stuff.""  Unlike PredictIt, where bets are capped to $850 per contract and no more than 5,000 traders may bet on any contract, or Polymarket, which requires a rudimentary understanding of crypto (and an IP address outside the U.S.) to use, Kalshi is courting Wall Street bigwigs. Its congressional control contract would allow positions up to $100 million.  Allowing regulated prediction markets would be in the public interest, Strumpf argued, because ""if any of these concerns that the CFTC has are valid, these are aboveboard, regulated markets that are in the sunlight.""  One of those concerns is the potential impact on election integrity – and the CFTC's mandate. While the agency regulates futures markets, it also has jurisdiction to police fraud in the spot, or cash, markets for the underlying commodities. The agency has experience investigating things like fraudulent cattle sales, but says it is unprepared to become an ""election cop.""  ""Our new authorities would per se include monitoring elections, candidates and countless participants in the political machinations that proliferate in the media and cyberspace,"" CFTC Chair Rostin Benham said when he denied Kalshi's application last year.

With concerns over Bitcoin’s (BTC) volatile price trajectory following Arthur Hayes’ bearish predictions, both Sui (SUI) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are quickly gaining favor among investors looking for the next big opportunity. While Sui (SUI) has been showing consistent gains amidst Bitcoin’s lag, GoodEgg (GEGG), a meme coin with AI and social finance integration, is being hailed as the next big player that could deliver up to 300x returns by September. Sui (SUI) Rallies Amid Bitcoin’s Uncertain Path The market has been closely watching Sui (SUI), which continues to surge despite Bitcoin’s recent struggles. The token has gained 12.1% over the last week, with many investors eyeing it as a safer bet amidst the broader market uncertainty. While Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMEX, recently predicted that Bitcoin could drop to $50K due to several factors such as ETF outflows and a potential rate hike, Sui (SUI) is benefiting from its resilience and decoupling from Bitcoin’s trends. Sui (SUI)’s bullish rally can be attributed to consistent whale activity and upgrades, particularly its recent Mysticeti enhancements, which have improved the blockchain’s performance and scalability. Investors have been drawn to Sui (SUI)’s potential to surpass the $1 mark, with many analysts believing it could surge further as its blockchain continues to gain market dominance. GoodEgg (GEGG): The Best Newcomer in the AI and Meme Coin Space While Sui (SUI) leads the charge among utility tokens, GoodEgg (GEGG) is positioning itself as a disruptive force in the meme coin space. What sets GoodEgg (GEGG) apart from traditional meme coins is its integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and social finance (Social-Fi). The platform allows users to earn rewards through social interactions and dating activities, blending entertainment with financial incentives. This innovative model has caught the attention of both meme coin enthusiasts and serious investors alike. In just one day, GoodEgg (GEGG) completed 70% of its Stage 1 presale, selling over 2.4 billion tokens at a price of $0.00015 USDT. With the presale gaining momentum, analysts are predicting that GoodEgg (GEGG) could deliver 300x returns by the end of September, positioning it as one of the most promising new entrants in the market. Comparing Sui (SUI) and GoodEgg (GEGG): Which Will Deliver Bigger Gains? While both Sui (SUI) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are gaining traction, they cater to different types of investors. Sui (SUI) is an emerging Layer-1 blockchain that is positioned to compete with Ethereum in terms of scalability and transaction speed. Its recent Mysticeti upgrades have strengthened the network, attracting long-term institutional investors who are looking for utility-driven blockchain projects. On the other hand, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a unique blend of meme coin appeal and real-world utility through its AI-powered dating platform. Investors who initially flocked to meme coins like Dogecoin are now seeing GoodEgg (GEGG) as an attractive alternative due to its combination of fun, social interaction, and financial rewards. With analysts projecting significant growth for GoodEgg (GEGG), it could emerge as the next big meme coin to watch. Investor Outlook: A Diversified Approach Given the current uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin, investors are diversifying their portfolios by turning their focus to high-growth projects like Sui (SUI) and GoodEgg (GEGG). While Arthur Hayes’ bearish prediction for Bitcoin has cast a shadow over the market, both Sui (SUI) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are poised to offer substantial returns for those looking to capitalize on new opportunities. In particular, GoodEgg (GEGG)’s AI and Social-Fi elements provide a compelling case for investors seeking to move beyond speculative meme coins and into projects with tangible utility and user engagement. Meanwhile, Sui (SUI) continues to dominate the blockchain space with its technological advancements, making it a strong candidate for those who prioritize infrastructure and long-term growth. Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market braces for potential shifts following Bitcoin’s turbulent price predictions, Sui (SUI) and GoodEgg (GEGG) are emerging as two of the most promising projects to watch in September. Sui (SUI), with its recent gains and blockchain upgrades, is attracting attention from institutional investors, while GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a unique and innovative approach to meme coins through its AI-driven platform. Both tokens are positioned for significant growth in the coming weeks, with analysts predicting that GoodEgg (GEGG) could deliver up to 300x returns. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the latest trends, Sui (SUI) and GoodEgg (GEGG) represent two distinct but highly promising opportunities in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency.

The bank said bitcoin could reach $125,000 if Trump wins and $75,000 if Harris triumphs.  Standard Chartered said positive catalysts such as regulatory reform are expected to dominate the crypto market, regardless of the election outcome.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}, the world's largest cryptocurrency, is expected to hit a new high by year-end, regardless of who wins the U.S. election in November, investment bank Standard Chartered (STAN) said in a report on Thursday resuming coverage of the sector.  The outcome of the U.S. presidential election is important for digital assets, but it matters less than when Biden was the Democratic candidate, and less than markets think, the bank said.  Bitcoin is expected to hit new all-time highs by year-end irrespective of who wins the election, the report said, and could reach about $125,000 if Trump wins or around $75,000 if Kamala Harris triumphs.  The bank sees positive drivers dominating the crypto market.  ""Progress on relaxing regulations - particularly the repeal of SAB 121, which imposes stringent accounting rules on banks' digital asset holdings - will continue in 2025 no matter who is in the White House,"" wrote Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, adding that progress would just take longer under a Harris presidency.  A re-steepening of the U.S. Treasury curve is also ""building positive momentum"" for bitcoin, the report noted.  Bitcoin is likely to sell-off initially if Harris wins, but Kendrick expects any dip to be bought as investors recognise that regulatory progress will still happen, albeit at a slower pace, and as other positive catalysts take over.

33501784,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641333,1726138852,Challenges Mount For Bitcoin Miners As Difficulty Surges To Record High,"A recent report by Bloomberg highlights that the difficulty of mining Bitcoin has surged to a record high, reflecting increasing competition among cryptocurrency miners. On Wednesday, mining difficulty rose by 3.5%, as reported by crypto-mining tracker CoinWarz. This metric, which has been climbing steadily, often aligns with market expectations for Bitcoin’s price movements. Post-Halving Challenges Following the April Halving, which reduced miners’ potential revenue by half, the Bitcoin price has dropped approximately 10% to a current trading price of $57,000. Per the report, this reduction has significantly pressured the profit margins of many mining companies, particularly those operating at higher costs. Christopher Bendiksen, Bitcoin research lead at CoinShares, noted: The effect of the all-time high in difficulty, right on the back of the Halving, is making the outlook extremely challenging for many miners—especially those at the higher end of the cost curve. The researcher added that if current trends persist, some miners may struggle to remain cash flow positive, let alone achieve profitability. Related Reading: Polkadot Recovery Stalls As Bearish Pressure Returns With $3.5 In Sight Miners play a crucial role in the Bitcoin ecosystem by using specialized computers to validate transaction data on the blockchain, thereby securing the network. In return for their efforts, they earn Bitcoin rewards. However, the financial landscape for miners has been tough this year; shares of major publicly traded mining companies have plummeted, with Marathon Digital Inc. and Riot Platforms Inc. experiencing declines of 31% and 54%, respectively. In contrast, Bitcoin’s price has shown consistency despite current challenges, climbing 38% and reaching a record high of $73,798 in March, fueled by optimism surrounding the demand for US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold BTC. Additionally, Bitcoin’s hash rate—the total computing power supporting the network—hit an all-time high in September, indicating strong participation in mining activities. Crucial Months Ahead For The Bitcoin Market Historically, the Bitcoin price has often dipped following its Halving event, only to rebound several months later, eventually hitting new record highs. Many industry participants are anticipating a potential rally in the fourth quarter, with Bobby Zagotta, CEO of crypto exchange Bitstamp USA, expressing optimism about market movements. However, Bendiksen cautioned that many miners appear to be banking on a significant price increase in Bitcoin. “If that fails to materialize, there will be trouble ahead for some operators,” he warned.

Data Reveals A Rising Open Interest The coming months will be crucial in determining the sustainability of mining operations and the broader health of the market, with expectations for further price recoveries increasing in the latter part of the year, with other potential catalysts including easing macroeconomic conditions and the outcome of the US election. As of now, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is down a slight 0.4% in the 24-hour time frame, and nearly 2% in the last seven days, showing BTC’s struggle to regain previously lost levels.

42407682,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0kcP,1726138017,Leverage in the Bitcoin Market Is Increasing Again as $58.5K Becomes Key Level,"Renewed bias for leverage points to increased investor risk appetite.  High-leverage liquidity in bitcoin is concentrated at around $58,500.  Increased leverage indicates traders taking on more risk and a possible jump in price volatility.  Leverage in the bitcoin {{BTC}} market is growing again, a sign traders are looking to take on more risk, potentially injecting volatility into the market.  The so-called estimated leverage ratio, which divides global futures open interest by the number of coins held on exchanges, has jumped to 0.2060, the highest since October 2023, according to data tracked by analytics firm CryptoQuant.  The increase follows a months-long consolidation below 0.20, pointing to traders increasingly using borrowed funds to amplify their futures positions and a risk-on environment. A low ratio suggests a cautious approach.  The estimated leverage ratio peaked following the collapse of Sam Bankman Fried's FTX exchange, formerly the third-largest futures trading platform in late 2022 and trended lower till December 2023.  Leverage allows traders to control larger positions with relatively little capital, magnifying both profits and losses. It's a double-edged sword that exposes traders to margin shortages and forced liquidations when the market moves against their positions, which, in turn, adds to price volatility.  ""The recent increase in the Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio suggests a growing trend among investors toward higher leverage in the derivatives market,"" CryptoQuant said in a blog post.  $58,500 is the key level  According to Hyblock Capital, high-leverage liquidity is stacked at around $58,500. So, once prices approach that level, volatility could pick up, especially because overall market liquidity remains low. That means a buy/sell order can have an outsized impact on the going market rate.  ""High-leverage liquidity zones around $58,500 could drive increased volatility and create opportunities for traders as Bitcoin gravitates toward these levels,"" Hyblock said in an email to CoinDesk.  ""Combined order book liquidity remains low, suggesting bullish potential, while the global bid-ask ratio remains positive, indicating robust underlying demand,"" Hyblock added.  At press time, bitcoin changed hands at around $58,000, representing a 2.5% over 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.

U.S. consumers are warming up to crypto, with less than 1% calling it a ""fad,"" a dramatic decline from previous years, Deutsche Bank (DB) said in a report on Wednesday.  Just over half of the people surveyed viewed crypto as an important asset class and method of payment, and 65% said they could see it replacing cash. The bank surveyed over 3,600 consumers in the U.S., U.K. and Europe in March and July.  ""We expect cryptocurrency democratisation to advance further over the next 2-3 years driven by exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Federal Reserve policy, and regulation,"" analysts Marion Laboure and Sai Ravindran wrote.  It's not all good news, with bitcoin {{BTC}}, the world's largest cryptocurrency, garnering a gloomy outlook for the rest of the year and stablecoins, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), facing an uncertain future in respondents' eyes.  A third of consumers said they thought the BTC price would be below $60,000 by year-end, and only 12%-14% thought it would cross $70,000. Bitcoin was trading around $58,200 at publication time. For the longer term, perceptions were mixed: 40% of respondents said they thought BTC would thrive in the coming years, while 38% said they expected it to disappear.  The outlook for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that's designed to hold a steady value, was also viewed with circumspection. Just 18% of those surveyed said they expected stablecoins to thrive, whereas 42% expected them to fade. Those backed by a fiat currency such as the dollar or a traditional commodity like gold were most likely to keep their value, the survey said.

33501043,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24134,1726135528,What is the AssangeDAO and the JUSTICE token?,"AssangeDAO is a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) formed in 2022 by a collective of cypherpunks with the goal of supporting Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, in his legal battles. The DAO successfully raised over $53 million in Ethereum (ETH) through the issuance of JUSTICE governance tokens, which were used to bid on a unique NFT created in collaboration between Assange and digital artist Pak. The funds raised were directed to the Wau Holland Foundation to cover Assange’s legal fees and related campaign efforts. AssangeDAO demonstrates the power of novel crypto structures like DAOs in mobilising resources for social and political causes, while also navigating the challenges of governance and community consensus within a leaderless structure. Get Started AssangeDAO Was Instrumental in Freeing Julian Assange AssangeDAO is a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) formed in 2022 by a collective of cypherpunks and activists who were committed to supporting the legal defence of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks . The DAO’s primary goal was to raise funds for Assange’s legal battles, leveraging the power of blockchain technology and the principles of decentralisation. Through the issuance of the JUSTICE governance token, AssangeDAO successfully raised over $53 million in Ethereum (ETH) via the Juicebox platform. These funds were used to bid on a unique NFT, created in collaboration between Assange and the digital artist Pak , titled “Clock 1/1.” The proceeds from the NFT auction were directed to the Wau Holland Foundation , a nonprofit organisation that has long supported Assange and WikiLeaks. The DAO spent $37 million on Assange’s legal defence before he was freed after a plea deal , earlier this year. The creation of AssangeDAO marked a significant moment in the intersection of cryptocurrency and activism. The DAO’s ability to mobilise a substantial amount of funds in a short period highlighted the potential of decentralised platforms to bring together like-minded individuals for a common cause. The JUSTICE tokens issued to over 6,000 contributors not only represented their financial contribution but also provided them with governance rights within the DAO, allowing them to participate in decisions about the organisation’s future actions. This governance model empowered the community to take an active role in shaping the direction of the DAO, emphasising the decentralised nature of the organisation. Despite its success in raising funds, AssangeDAO faced challenges, particularly in its governance structure. The decision to allocate the majority of the funds to the NFT auction sparked debates within the community, with some members advocating for a more diversified use of the funds. The decentralised and leaderless nature of the DAO also led to a sense of directionlessness at times, contributing to internal disagreements . However, the DAO remained committed to its core mission of supporting Assange, and its efforts were widely recognized as a significant contribution to his legal defence. As Julian Assange’s legal battle has now finally concluded, AssangeDAO’s role in his defence remains a notable example of how decentralised organisations can be leveraged for social and political activism. The DAO’s impact on Assange’s case has demonstrated the potential of cryptocurrency to provide financial support in situations where traditional funding methods may be constrained. TRADE JUSTICE NOW A Legal Struggle Which Lasted Over A Decade Julian Assange, became a prominent and controversial figure due to his role in publishing classified documents that exposed alleged government misconduct and war crimes, particularly related to U.S. military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. His legal troubles began in 2010 when Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for him over allegations of sexual misconduct, which Assange denied, claiming the charges were politically motivated. To avoid extradition to Sweden, which he feared could lead to further extradition to the United States, Assange sought asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2012, where he remained confined for nearly seven years. The U.S. government had been pursuing Assange for his role in publishing classified documents, charging him under the Espionage Act. In 2019, after Ecuador revoked his asylum status, British authorities arrested Assange at the embassy. This led to a prolonged legal battle in the UK courts, where Assange fought extradition to the United States. If extradited, he faced up to 175 years in prison on charges related to the publication of classified materials that the U.S. government argued had endangered lives and national security. However, Assange’s supporters contended that his actions were protected under freedom of the press and that his prosecution was a grave threat to journalistic freedom worldwide. Throughout this period, Assange’s health deteriorated, and concerns over his well-being became a central issue in the legal proceedings. His defence argued that his extradition to the U.S. would expose him to inhumane conditions and that his mental and physical health would likely suffer irreparable harm. In 2021, a UK court ruled against his extradition on the grounds of his mental health, but this decision was appealed by the US government. As the legal battles dragged on, Assange remained in the high-security Belmarsh Prison in London. In a surprising turn of events in 2024, Assange struck a plea deal with US authorities, allowing him to plead guilty to a single charge under the Espionage Act, which led to his release after more than a decade of legal turmoil. The deal marked the end of a 14-year saga that had seen Assange go from a globally recognized advocate for transparency to a prisoner fighting for his freedom. His release was hailed by supporters as a victory for press freedom, though the circumstances of his plea deal sparked ongoing debates about the implications for whistleblowers and journalists who expose government secrets. Join the discussion about AssangeDAO on our Discord! Assange’s Unlikely Role in Bring Bitcoin to the Attention of the Mainstream Julian Assange, played an unexpected yet significant role in bringing Bitcoin into the public spotlight, particularly during the early days of the cryptocurrency. In 2010, WikiLeaks came under immense pressure from governments and financial institutions due to its controversial publications of classified government documents. In response, traditional payment processors like Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal blocked donations to WikiLeaks, effectively cutting off the organisation’s financial lifeline. Seeking alternative means of funding, WikiLeaks turned to Bitcoin, which was still in its infancy at the time. This move brought Bitcoin into mainstream attention as it provided a censorship-resistant way for people to support WikiLeaks, a cause that resonated with many who valued transparency and free speech. However, this newfound attention on Bitcoin alarmed Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. At that time, Bitcoin was a relatively obscure project, still in its early stages of development, with a small community of enthusiasts and developers working to establish its foundation. Satoshi feared that the sudden influx of attention from WikiLeaks and its supporters could bring unwelcome scrutiny to Bitcoin from governments and regulatory authorities, potentially derailing the project before it had a chance to mature. Satoshi believed that Bitcoin was not yet ready to withstand such high-profile exposure and that it could be crushed under the weight of governmental pressure if it became too closely associated with WikiLeaks’ controversial activities. In response to the news that WikiLeaks intended to accept Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto took to the BitcoinTalk forum, where the early Bitcoin community gathered, to express concern . In a now-famous post from December 2010, Satoshi implored WikiLeaks not to use Bitcoin, stating, “The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.” Satoshi’s plea highlighted the precarious position Bitcoin was in at the time, balancing on the edge of obscurity and global recognition. Despite Satoshi’s concerns, WikiLeaks ultimately decided to accept Bitcoin, and the move did indeed bring Bitcoin into the global spotlight. While the initial fears of government crackdown did not materialise to the extent Satoshi had feared, the association with WikiLeaks undoubtedly accelerated Bitcoin’s rise to prominence. The incident demonstrated the power of Bitcoin as a tool for financial freedom and censorship resistance, attracting a new wave of users who saw it as more than just a digital currency but as a vehicle for social and political change. In hindsight, this event marked a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s history, both boosting its adoption and setting the stage for future debates about the balance between privacy, freedom, and the law in the cryptocurrency arena.

While Quant (QNT) is catching the attention of traders with its remarkable rally, many investors are turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE), anticipating exponential returns. Quant’s Explosive Rally In recent days, Quant (QNT) has stunned the crypto world with a bullish breakout, recording a price surge of over 15%. As of today, QNT stands at $71, with the potential to hit the $115 mark in the near future. This momentum has led to growing optimism among investors, who believe the token could reach even higher resistance levels. Quant (QNT)’s price action has been underpinned by a strong technical setup. The token recently broke out of a falling wedge pattern, a signal that often precedes a major rally. According to Coinglass data, open interest in QNT futures has increased, signaling fresh inflows of capital as more traders look to profit from the upward trend. If the token successfully breaks through the resistance range between $70 and $81, Quant (QNT) could climb towards its next major targets of $99 to $115. On-Chain Data Supports Quant’s Bullish Outlook Beyond its price movement, on-chain data suggests that Quant (QNT) is poised for further gains. Key indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), are showing positive signs. The RSI recently entered overbought territory, reflecting strong buying pressure, while the MACD has formed a bullish divergence, indicating that the upward trend may continue. Quant (QNT)’s daily active addresses have also surged, reflecting increased user activity and adoption. This metric, along with a decreasing supply on exchanges, suggests that investors are holding onto their QNT tokens, further reducing selling pressure. All these factors point to a continued rally, with some analysts predicting that Quant (QNT) could eventually reach up to $115. Mpeppe: The New ICO That’s Attracting Investor Attention While Quant (QNT) is enjoying a surge in price, another token is quickly gaining popularity—Mpeppe (MPEPE). This new gambling-focused ICO has captured the interest of many, especially those looking for high-reward opportunities in a fast-evolving sector. With its innovative decentralized gambling platform and strong community backing, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is expected to become a major player in the crypto space. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s unique selling proposition lies in its ability to merge DeFi and gaming, offering a seamless experience for users while delivering significant returns for investors. The gambling market within the blockchain space is rapidly expanding, and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale has already drawn the attention of whales, who are accumulating large amounts of the token in anticipation of a massive rally. Quant’s Path to $115 As investors flock to Mpeppe (MPEPE) for potential gains, Quant (QNT) remains a top contender for those seeking stability and long-term growth. The current market sentiment around Quant (QNT) is overwhelmingly positive, with several technical factors pointing towards further upside. According to Philipp Nyhoegen, Quant’s price has the potential to reach as high as $115, especially if it maintains its current momentum. The key lies in the token’s ability to break through its next resistance levels. If it succeeds, traders could see QNT testing its all-time highs. However, there are cautionary signs as well. The overbought RSI on the 4-hour chart suggests that a short-term correction could occur before the token resumes its upward trajectory. Support levels between $42 and $52 remain crucial, and any failure to maintain the current price level could result in a retracement. Conclusion: Quant and Mpeppe Offer Unique Opportunities In the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency, Quant (QNT) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are providing investors with unique opportunities to profit. Quant (QNT)’s breakout from its falling wedge pattern, combined with strong on-chain data, suggests that the token could reach $115 in the near future. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers the chance for early investors to participate in a high-growth sector, with the potential for massive returns.

33499127,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641307,1726133453,Failed Solana Token Scheme? Hacker Targets 2.6 Million Indian Cricket Fans With X Scam,"On Tuesday, Indian cricket fans were targeted by scammers with a Solana-based token. The attackers attempted to profit from sports fans after hacking Delhi Capitals’ X account. However, the scheme failed to gain much traction despite its peculiar efforts to publicize the memecoin. Related Reading: Altcoins About To Take Over? Analyst Suggests Time To Accumulate Will End Soon Crypto Hackers’ New Promotional Method Delhi Capitals, a team from the Indian Premier League (IPL), recently suffered a social media security breach. Hackers took control of the cricket team’s X account on Tuesday, targeting their 2.6 million followers. The attackers promoted a Solana-based token in a series of now-deleted posts, hoping to pump the price with their peculiar tactics. Typically, hackers try to take advantage of public figures or institutions with large followings by posing as them. Most of the time, attackers promote Solana-based memecoins related to the hacked personality. Scammers pretend these public figures have entered the crypto space, sometimes advertising fake collaborations with institutions within the industry. These methods usually deceive thousands of unsuspected users who invest money in these scams. In this case, Delhi Capital hackers took a different approach. The scammers named their Solana memecoin “HACKER” and publicly declared they had unauthorized access to the account. One of the posts stated, “Yes, this is a hacked account!” and claimed that they would “make profits” from it. The hackers revealed they use this method to boost their scams, repeatedly asking users to search for the ticker on X so they could see their “strength”: We will make profits, WE hack accounts on each account the token address will be posted and the token will pump. Search $HACKER to see our strength!. A quick search on X revealed that this wasn’t the attackers’ first rodeo. The ticker shows that the hackers previously attempted to scam crypto investors and sports fans with this method. Per the report, Korean Esports team T1 and two crypto-related apps recently suffered similar security breaches. The respective posts displayed the exact message as Delhi Capitals but had a different Solana contract address. Solana Memecoin Fails To Make Big Numbers Solana memecoin scams have collected millions of dollars from users before. As reported by NewsBTC, several celebrities and companies have fallen victim to these schemes. Recently, hackers promoted a fake Solana token on McDonald’s official Instagram account. The memecoin, themed after the character Grimace, surged over 400% to a market capitalization of $25 million in less than an hour. This resulted in approximately $700,000 in ill-gotten profits for the scammer. Other rug pull scams have targeted the fan bases of personalities like Real Madrid player Kylian Mbappé, and former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. The latter resulted in a $17 million scam. Nonetheless, the Delhi Capitals hackers failed to profit from the cricket team’s 2.6 million followers. The HACKER token didn’t surpass a market capitalization of $40,000 on the day of its creation and failed to reach half of that as the scam was taking place. Related Reading: Crypto Investor Loses $16 Million Amid Friend.tech’s Controversy And Token Crash It’s worth noting that, during these types of scams, some investors consciously trade these fake tokens to profit from the hype before the scheme ends. This time, most of the token’s transactions appear to have been done by the hackers in preparation for their heist. After the cricket team regained control of the X account and deleted all the HACKER-related posts, the token’s trading activity plummeted to zero. As of this writing, the Solana memecoin has a market cap of $4,300.

42407685,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0kpd,1726132427,Bitcoin Yields as High as 45% on Offer in Pendle's New Pools,"DeFi platform Pendle's new pools allows users to earn floating yields up to 45% and fixed yields of 10% on a bitcoin-based token.  The yields are achieved through staking service Lombard's LBTC token in collaboration with Ethereum layer-2 network Corn.  Pendle splits investments into principal tokens and yield tokens that can be traded separately, facilitating high-yield strategies by allowing users to trade future returns.  DeFi platform Pendle on Wednesday started offering pools with variable yields of as high as 45% on a bitcoin {{BTC}}-backed token in a move that expands the product’s fundamentals.  The offering, which can also provide fixed yields of an annualized 10%, allows users to deposit LBTC, a liquid-staking token issued by restaking startup Lombard, in a Pendle pool made by Ethereum layer-2 network Corn. Data shows the pool has attracted over $13 million in user deposits since going live. It matures on Dec. 26.  “We’ve seen major use cases with fixed yield for ETH, and we’re aiming to replicate the same success with BTC as well,” CEO TN Lee told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “It’s going to be a busy few weeks for us as we roll out new pools and launches.”  Pendle's approach is to divide investments into a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, such as Compound or Aave, into two: the principle put up by the investor and the yield expected to be earned on that position in the form of token rewards. The split into a principal token (PT) and a yield token (YT) that can traded on the open market creates the high yields possible on Pendle’s pools.  Users can buy YT with LBTC, giving them increased exposure to the underlying yield and points from LBTC and Corn until maturity, at which point the YT will be worth zero. If they forego those rewards, they can elect to receive either the fixed yield or the floating yield, which comprises the points that can be monetized and future tokens that will be airdropped to LBTC holders.  Lombard is a restaking service that converts wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) to a Lombard Bitcoin (LBTC) token that can be used in DeFi applications to capture yield. Corn, another startup, is a network that uses bitcoin as the main token to pay usage fees.  Unwrapping the jargon: Liquid staking is a service that allows users to stake their crypto assets and receive a new token in exchange. Layer 2s are blockchains focusing on a specific use case atop a broader service blockchain. DeFi refers to using automated smart contracts to provide financial services, such as lending and borrowing to users. A pool can be considered a digital locker to store assets and earn returns, similar to bank accounts.

This metric, which tracks the ratio of open interest to coin reserves on exchanges, signals increased leverage use among market participants. The growing trend suggests that investors are taking on more risk by “employing higher leverage,” which could significantly impact Bitcoin’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Battles to Extend Gains: Will It Clear $58K? The Impact Of High Leverage On Bitcoin’s Market The increase in Bitcoin’s estimated leverage ratio highlights the growing use of leverage among investors in the derivatives market. Leverage allows traders to borrow funds to increase their exposure to Bitcoin without needing to hold the full amount of capital upfront. While this can amplify profits during periods of market upswings, it also increases the risk of significant losses if the market moves against the position. A high leverage ratio can often be a double-edged sword for the crypto market. On the one hand, it may indicate that investors are increasingly confident in Bitcoin’s potential for an upward move, especially if the market sees a breakout. On the other hand, if Bitcoin’s price continues to decline, it could lead to a wave of liquidations as overleveraged positions are forced to close, exacerbating the downward pressure. This trend of rising leverage has drawn attention from various market analysts. CryptoQuant analyst EgyHash pointed out that the estimated leverage ratio reaching its highest point this year could lead to increased volatility in the market. The higher the leverage, the more sensitive the market becomes to price swings, as even small moves can trigger liquidations and create cascading effects. Analysts Weigh In On Bitcoin Future Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price continues to face challenges, particularly its inability to break above key resistance. The cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain momentum, and despite the increased leverage in the market, Bitcoin has experienced a mere 0.2% increase over the past 24 hours and a 2.1% drop over the past week. As a result, the asset is now trading below $57,000, with a current price of $56,871. While Bitcoin’s price remains under pressure, several prominent crypto analysts have shared their perspectives on what lies ahead for the cryptocurrency. Among them is the analyst known as CryptoBullet, who recently compared Bitcoin’s current cycle to previous bull markets. In a post on X, CryptoBullet highlighted the similarities between the present market and Bitcoin’s 2013 cycle, noting that the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (Stoch RSI) has shown patterns that mirror those seen during the 2013 rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovery: Has BTC Prevented A Fall To $41,000 With This Surge?

Wave structure suggests completion of the pattern, with a potential breakout move in September. Fear/Greed Index indicates more bearish sentiment to unwind, potential for a powerful 5th wave rally to $190,000. Since my last article on Bitcoin (BTC-USD), in which I called the bottom to the ongoing bullish sideways correction, the leading cryptocurrency has consolidated above and below the swingline $60k level, prepping for another run at the all-time highs in the $70-74k range. The most recent selloff appears to have put in a higher low. TheBullBear.com, TradingView One could also look at the above chart and see a reverse Head and Shoulders formation, with the left shoulder completing in early June, the head completing in late July, and the final run-up to the neckline to complete the right shoulder in progress now. A move above the $60k level breaks the short-term downtrend. That's not far away. In terms of wave structure, BTC-USD has a few legs to go before the abcde triangle pattern is fully completed, though the c-wave low has already been realized. Once it gets back above $60k for more than a day, it should run to $70-72k, completing the d-wave. Then, we would look for a high-level consolidation between $74-65k that would set the final stage for the next bull run. The daily chart tends to suggest we could see the breakout move come in mid- to late-September: TheBullBear.com, TradingView Here we can see that we are currently in the wave 4 position of a bullish impulse 5 wave pattern. Let's compare the wave 1-2 sequence with the current wave 3-4 sequence. Wave 1 peaked in April of 2023, and this was followed by a 183-day sideways Wave 2. Note the compression of the 20-, 50-, and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages at the time the correction was completed and the Wave 3 rally ensued. Also, note the behavior and position of the Relative Strength Index (in the lower pane). Now, have a look at current conditions. The similarities are striking. If the duration of the correction is the same, then this current formation should be completed around September 12. Here's a closer look at the daily: TheBullBear.com, TradingView The pattern is keeping to a nice falling flag channel. Price today is at levels seen in May, so the trend is firmly sideways in overlapping waves. Also, note that a break above $60k would also represent a break above the converged moving averages. Also, note the bull RSI divergence at the recent low, with the price making a lower low but the RSI putting in a higher low. Conversely, a break and close back below $53k would cast this analysis into doubt, and we would have to reconsider if that were to happen. The weekly chart shows a long sideways consolidation right at previous all-time highs, typically a bullish preparation for a rally. TheBullBear.com, TradingView Weekly RSI is right at support, the same level from which the last big rally commenced. Let's have a look at the Crypto Fear/Greed Index. Alternative.me Note that when the Wave 2 correction ended on October 13, the index was at a moderate reading of 44 after reaching a low of 30 about a month before. At its recent low, the index registered an extremely fearful reading near 20, with a high fear of 27 still persisting in spite of a sharp price recovery from the lows and new all-time highs not far away. This means there is much more bearish sentiment to unwind than when wave 3 began, and therefore much more bullish fuel that should drive the ""fear of missing out"" wave 5 rally, once the breakout happens. It's also worth noting that in Bitcoin bull movements, the 5th wave is typically the most powerful, far exceeding the percentage gains of waves 1 and 3. But if wave 5 here simply matches the 180% move of wave 3, then it would reach a price of $190,000. This is smack in the middle of the $100-$300k range that I have called for in previous articles . If, on the other hand, Bitcoin were to get back down to the $53-50k region, I would become concerned about the validity of this analysis. At that point, the uptrend from the November 2022 low would be in jeopardy or broken, and I would be forced to reconsider this analysis and perhaps take a different viewpoint. My take is we've got 2-4 weeks of consolidation below the $74-72k resistance range before the next Bitcoin bull run begins. See my previous articles on Bitcoin for more detail and in-depth analysis.

Data tracked by London-based CCData show the buy-sell ratio, which compares the volume of buy-to-sell orders on Kraken and Coinbase, has averaged 250% and 123%, respectively, this month.

Bitcoin's price began the month on a negative note, falling from $60,000 to nearly $52,500 before recovering to $58,000 this week, CoinDesk data shows. Still, prices are down over 7% for the third quarter.

33471365,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641274,1726123258,Uniswap Overcome Recent Challenges As Surges and Investors Flock To Mpeppe,"Uniswap (UNI), one of the most prominent decentralized exchanges (DEX) in the crypto space, is currently making headlines for its potential 139% price breakout. As regulatory discussions unfold in the U.S. Congress, investors are eyeing both Uniswap and the up-and-coming Mpeppe (MPEPE) token for substantial gains. With Uniswap facing heightened scrutiny but showing signs of a bullish reversal, many are diversifying into Mpeppe, which has been forecasted to surge alongside the broader market. Uniswap and the Impact of DeFi Regulations Uniswap (UNI) finds itself at the center of a critical moment in DeFi history as the U.S. Congress kicks off its first-ever hearing on decentralized finance. Titled “Decoding DeFi: Breaking Down the Future for Decentralized Finance,” the hearing aims to explore regulatory approaches to DeFi in the United States. Uniswap, being one of the leading platforms in the DeFi ecosystem, stands to benefit significantly from these discussions, especially if favorable policies are introduced. With Uniswap (UNI)’s price currently hovering around $6.55, analysts are watching for a bullish breakout. The platform has already garnered significant interest from U.S.-based users, according to Statista data, making it a potential winner from any positive policy outcomes. Uniswap Price Set for 139% Surge? Despite regulatory uncertainty, Uniswap (UNI)’s technical chart reveals a bullish reversal pattern. The price is forming a falling wedge, a structure often associated with upward momentum. With the apex of the wedge nearing, traders are preparing for a significant breakout, which could propel Uniswap (UNI)’s price to $16, marking a 139% increase from current levels. This optimistic scenario hinges on the price breaking through key resistance levels around $9 and moving towards $16. A bullish breakout is becoming increasingly likely as market participants anticipate the results of the congressional hearings, which could shape the future of DeFi in the United States. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Gathers Momentum While Uniswap (UNI) has been in the spotlight due to regulatory scrutiny, another token, Mpeppe (MPEPE), is quietly building momentum. With its unique gambling and gaming ecosystem, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has attracted attention from both retail and institutional investors. As Uniswap (UNI) whales and other big players look to diversify their portfolios, many are turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) for its high-growth potential. Market experts have predicted that Mpeppe (MPEPE) could see a 150% surge in the coming weeks, making it a hot target for traders seeking rapid returns. This token, which offers a mix of utility in decentralized gambling and community-driven incentives, is quickly gaining traction and becoming a serious contender in the crypto market. How Uniswap and Mpeppe Could Complement Each Other The simultaneous rise of Uniswap (UNI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) shows how the DeFi ecosystem is maturing. While Uniswap (UNI) provides the infrastructure for decentralized trading, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an innovative platform that blends DeFi with gaming and gambling, a combination that is proving to be highly attractive to users. As Uniswap (UNI) continues to attract large trading volumes, particularly from U.S. users, many traders are using their profits from Uniswap (UNI) to invest in Mpeppe (MPEPE), anticipating significant gains. With Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s expected price surge and Uniswap (UNI)’s potential breakout, both tokens represent a new wave of opportunity for crypto investors. Uniswap’s Price at a Critical Junction The next few days will be crucial for Uniswap (UNI). If the price successfully breaks out of the falling wedge pattern, we could see a rally towards $16, cementing Uniswap (UNI)’s position as a leading DEX. On the other hand, if the breakout fails, the price could drop as low as $4, or even $2, invalidating the current bullish sentiment. Investors are keenly watching the outcome of the congressional hearings and regulatory discussions, as these will likely dictate Uniswap (UNI)’s short-term trajectory. If DeFi regulations turn out to be favorable, we could witness a significant boost not only for Uniswap (UNI) but for the entire DeFi sector. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Uniswap and Mpeppe While Uniswap (UNI) is poised for a major breakout, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly emerging as the next big thing in the crypto market. With Uniswap (UNI) gaining from potential regulatory clarity and Mpeppe (MPEPE) capturing the attention of investors with its 150% growth forecast, both tokens are set to thrive. As the crypto space continues to evolve, Uniswap (UNI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer two distinct yet complementary investment opportunities. Uniswap (UNI) provides a robust platform for decentralized trading, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) is making waves in the gambling and gaming sectors. Together, they are paving the way for the next generation of DeFi innovations, offering investors substantial gains in the process.

BlackRock warns of continued market volatility, citing recession concerns, US election anxiety, and investor sell-offs. On-chain data indicates decreased investor engagement and trading volumes in Bitcoin and Ethereum. By Zain Vawda Bitcoin prices have recovered last week's losses as ETF flows snapped an 8-day streak of outflows. On September 10, there was a substantial increase in inflows, reaching $116.96 million, which is more than four times the $37.29 million recorded the day before. Source: SoSo Value Bitcoin (BTC-USD) tapped a high of 58000 yesterday before a pullback today pushed prices toward the psychological 55000 level. A bit of whipsaw price action today as markets digest US inflation data, which has all but confirmed a 25 bps rate cut at next week's meeting. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has issued a warning that they see more volatility flare-ups ahead and do not see the Fed cutting rates as fast as markets are predicting. According to the note released by BlackRock Investment Institute, including Jean Boivin, several elements are contributing to market volatility: renewed recession concerns due to weaker economic data, anxiety surrounding the upcoming U.S. elections, and investors selling off to accommodate new stock offerings. On-Chain Data Analysis Looking at on-chain data analysis from Glassnode, investor engagement with exchanges is decreasing, as shrinking trading volumes indicate a reduced interest in both investing and trading activities. Running a similar 30d/365d momentum cross-over for exchange-related inflows and outflows, we can see that the monthly average volume has fallen well below the yearly. This underscores a decline in investor demand and less trading by speculators within the current price range, which is no surprise given the lack of conviction we are seeing. Source: Glassnode While both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are experiencing outflows, the level of investor interest in Bitcoin ETFs is considerably greater. Despite the recent outflows, the Bitcoin ETF was a historic event for crypto markets, and recent analysis by Chainalysis' concurs. According to Chainalysis, the spot Bitcoin ETF increased crypto transactions globally to unprecedented levels. The launch of the Bitcoin ETF in the US triggered an increase in the total value of Bitcoin activity across all regions, and thus meant a significant milestone reached during the 2021 bull run has been surpassed. As always and more so when it comes to crypto, perspective is important. US Presidential Race and Debate Reaction The US Presidential debate took place yesterday and delivered very little. There was a notable omission of anything related to Bitcoin, despite the crypto lobby having spent $119 million on the election so far. Donald Trump is still broadly seen as the pro-crypto candidate, putting him at odds with Harris, who is expected to continue the Biden administration's hostile approach to crypto. For now, it would appear that markets are calm regarding the US election. However, the closer the date gets, the more chance there is that crypto will return as a talking point and that could stoke volatility. Technical Analysis BTC/USD Bitcoin fell today towards the psychological 55000 level before rebounding aggressively to trade above the support level at 56500. The daily candle close today will be crucial and could provide some insight into what to expect tomorrow. A bullish close will see the daily candle close as a hammer candlestick, which hints at further upside tomorrow. A bearish close would be a hanging man, which in theory points to some form of pullback. If one thing has become clear lately, range trading remains very much in play as market participants bide their time. The on chain data confirms this, with trading volume also suffering of late.

Despite the bitcoin price increase, U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs experienced outflows, with Ark Invest’s ARKB seeing a notable $54 million outflow.  AI tokens posted modest gains amid reports that OpenAI is planning to raise $6.5 billion at a $150 billion valuation.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} rose above $58,000 during the Asian morning hours on Thursday on the back of a rally in U.S. technology stocks and gains in the Asian equity market.  However, spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. slipped back to outflows on Wednesday, after a two-day inflow streak - losing $43 million led by a $54 million outflow from Ark Invest’s ARKB product.  U.S. inflation data for August supported bets for a Federal Reserve rate cut in coming weeks as core inflation rose faster than expected to more than 0.3%.  Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) ended the day up 8.2%, while major stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL) and Apple (APPL) jumped as high as 2.13%.  Gains spread to Asia on Thursday as stock indices in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan surged. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index broke out of a seven-day losing streak as the yen slightly retreated after a record high on Tuesday against U.S. dollars.  Meanwhile, layer-1 blockchain Sui (SUI) made waves on Thursday as the token beat the market, up over 16% according to CoinDesk Indices data, versus a 1.67% rise in the broader CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index.  SUI is likely outperforming the market because of Grayscale’s recent announcement about opening the Grayscale Sui Trust.  According to a public information page from Grayscale, the NAV per share of the Trust is $13.50, while each share has 14.95 SUI tokens in it, putting the value of each Sui token in the trust at 90 cents. Considering Sui’s current value of just over $1, the market seems to be setting up for a Grayscale discount.  Elsewhere, AI tokens posted modest gains as Bloomberg reported that OpenAI is planning to raise $6.5 billion at a valuation of $150 billion.

XRP Price Eyes Upside Break XRP price remained well-supported above the $0.5220 level like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price started a fresh increase within the range and was able to clear the $0.5320 resistance level.

The first major resistance is near the $0.5420 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5450. A clear move above the $0.5450 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5550 resistance. The next major resistance is near the $0.5640 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5800 resistance or even $0.5880 in the near term. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5420 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5330 level and the 100 hourly SMA. The next major support is $0.5280. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5280 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5220 support in the near term. The next major support sits at $0.5150.

33489933,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641131,1726113645,Dogecoin Vs Shiba Inu Vs Pepe: How Do The Top Memecoins Compare In Investor Profits?,"Here’s what on-chain data reveals regarding the profitability of the different segments of the Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe investors. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, & Pepe Compared In Terms Of Investor Profits In a new insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed how the three biggest memecoins in the sector, DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE, have been doing in terms of different indicators. Among these, one of the metrics that the analytics firm has talked about is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio Intraday, which tells us about the percentage of profit or loss the investors hold right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovery: Has BTC Prevented A Fall To $41,000 With This Surge? When the value of this metric is greater than 0%, it means the overall market is in a state of profit. On the other hand, the indicator being under this cutoff suggests the holders are carrying a net loss. In the context of the current topic, the MVRV Ratio Intraday of the entire market isn’t of interest but rather that of two specific segments: the 30-day and the 365-day investors. The MVRV Ratio Intraday for the 30-day investors would naturally only keep track of the profitability of the addresses who bought their coins within the past month. Similarly, the 365-day version of the metric would tell us about the profit/loss status of the buyers from the past year. Now, here is first the trend in these two indicators for the original memecoin, Dogecoin, over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin MVRV Intraday for the 30-day investors currently has a value of just 1.7%, which means this cohort is only slightly in the green. Usually, the long-term holders enjoy higher profits than those who recently bought, but in the case of DOGE, it’s the reverse right now. The investors who bought during the past year are in the red, with their holdings being almost 21% underwater. “With prices dropping significantly since its top in mid-April, there is an argument for a price rebound to bring this long-term deficit back to break-even,” notes Santiment. Dogecoin’s rival, Shiba Inu, has been doing even worse in these metrics, with both classes of investors being in loss. The 30-day Shiba Inu investors are holding their tokens at a slight loss of 1%, while the 365-day buyers are more than 31% below their average cost basis. Related Reading: Analyst Eyes 7% Dogecoin Jump—Will It Smash The $0.15 Barrier? Interestingly, Pepe’s situation is opposite to that of SHIB and DOGE, with the memecoin’s long-term holders having their patience rewarded. The monthly investors are down around 0.8% for PEPE, while the yearly ones are enjoying gains of almost 24%. According to the analytics firm, this indicates “there is still a bit of profit that patient traders may need to wait to see evaporate before there is a clear buy signal.” DOGE Price When writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.988, down almost 4% in the last 24 hours.

As to where the dog-themed meme coin might be headed next, crypto analyst The Forex Mindset has offered a bearish outlook, suggesting that its price rally might be over and that a price correction is imminent. NEIRO’s Price Could Drop Below $0.13 The Forex Mindset suggested in a post on TradingView that NEIRO will drop below $0.13. The analyst noted how the volume blocks hint at a price decline for the meme coin. He also highlighted the correction between NEIRO’s price and Bitcoin, adding that investors cannot depend on altcoins like this whenever Bitcoin is in a downtrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price by 2030: Analyst Reveals What Happens If Donald Trump Or Kamala Harris Wins With Bitcoin still showing signs that it could drop lower, this also supports the bearish outlook towards NEIRO, as the meme coin will likely decline if the flagship crypto drops below crucial support levels.

This overbought condition for NEIRO indicates that it is overvalued at its current price and that a price correction will occur soon enough. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst explained that whales will have a say in the meme coin’s next move. He highlighted a “contraction,” keeping NEIRO from falling below $0.14. This will likely be the case until these whales determine that the altcoin is ready for the contraction, whether below or above the trend. These whales look very bullish on NEIRO as the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed that the market maker Wintermute has accumulated 12.16 million NEIRO ($2.37 million) since Binance launched perpetual contracts for the meme coin. $1 Is Inevitable For NEIRO Crypto analyst Kong stated that $1 is inevitable for NEIRO. Kong indicated there was no reason to be bearish on NEIRO, considering its price is still below Bybit’s listing price. The crypto analyst added that the run for the meme coin hasn’t even started yet, as it will still rally to $1. A rally to $1 is significant as NEIRO will hit a billion-dollar market cap in the process. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovery Path To $60,000: Analyst Reveals Why $55,881 Is Important Crypto analyst Crypto Caesar has also offered a bullish outlook for NEIRO. In an X post, he mentioned that the meme coin looks “very good” at its current price level. The crypto analyst added that its price has broken through the resistance at $0.16 and will now look to retest that price level as a new support zone. He said that a successful retest could confirm more bullish momentum. At the time of writing, NEIRO is trading at around $0.172, down over 12% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

A CryptoQuant analyst named ‘Tarek’ has recently highlighted key indicators in a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, suggesting that Bitcoin’s price might soon experience a significant upward movement. These indicators include declining Bitcoin reserves on exchanges and increasing stablecoin reserves, which create an optimistic market outlook. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Heading For A Bear Market? Analysts Weigh In On The Price Struggles Key Indicators Signal Growing Buying Power According to the report shared by Tarek, over the past several months, Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have been on a downward trend, a phenomenon that often signals reduced selling pressure. When investors move their Bitcoin to cold storage, it limits the available supply on exchanges, which can result in a tighter market. This shift in supply dynamics is generally seen as bullish, suggesting that investors are holding their Bitcoin with the expectation of future price increases. In contrast to the decreasing Bitcoin reserves, Tarek highlighted that stablecoin reserves on exchanges are also rising. Notably, stablecoins such as USDT and USDC are widely used to store value during market uncertainty, allowing traders to deploy capital quickly when the right opportunity arises. The rising stablecoin reserves suggest that market participants are preparing for a potential entry point, further strengthening the bullish outlook for Bitcoin. This combination of shrinking Bitcoin reserves and rising stablecoin reserves creates an environment ripe for a price breakout. Tarek noted: The combination of shrinking Bitcoin reserves and rising stablecoin reserves sets the stage for a bullish price breakout. With reduced Bitcoin supply and growing buying power, the market is primed for a potential upward move. Historically, this supply-demand imbalance has led to significant price gains. Concluding the report, Tarek mentioned that the occurrence of a major rally might be as close as in the “coming weeks,” noting: As the market supply tightens and buying power builds, we could be on the verge of a price rally. Investors should stay alert for a potential breakout in the coming weeks. Bitcoin Current Market Performance Amid the bullishness in Bitcoin’s on-chain data, the asset still struggles to make a major move above the $60,000 psychological price level. So far, BTC has declined by 1.6% in the past day and 2.3% in the past week, pushing its price below $57,000 once again to trade for $56,047 at the time of writing. Related Reading: New ATH Incoming?

33484677,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641327,1726101034,11% Of Bitcoin Supply In Coinbase’s Hands: Analyzing The Potential Risks,"A recent report by The Defiant reveals that Coinbase holds a substantial 11% of the total Bitcoin supply, amounting to approximately 2.275 million BTC worth around $129 billion. As the fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, Coinbase commands significant trading volume—$1.5 billion in 24-hour transactions and 34 million monthly users—and acts as a custodian for major corporations, including BlackRock, Tesla, and MicroStrategy. However, this substantial concentration of Bitcoin within a single entity has raised important questions about the potential risks associated with such centralization. The Fallout Of A Potential Coinbase Disaster Per the report, critics argue that a significant concentration of assets can lead to systemic risks, particularly if the exchange were to face security issues, legal pressures, or other crises. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Is In A ‘Healthier’ Place Now, Here’s Why Jameson Lopp, CTO of multi-sig custodian Casa, points out that while Coinbase is considered more stable than many exchanges, it remains vulnerable to pressures from nation-states and could face scenarios akin to the US government’s historical seizure of gold during the 1930s. The implications of a Coinbase disaster—such as a hack resulting in the loss of customer funds—could reverberate throughout the cryptocurrency market. Such an event would not only undermine public confidence in crypto but could also lead to a significant downturn in market prices, potentially triggering a prolonged bear market. The report notes that the fear is compounded by the fact that more than 73 million Americans hold accounts on the platform, meaning the fallout could affect a vast number of retail investors. Could A Bitcoin Fork Be On The Horizon? While some experts, like Steven Lubka from Swan Private, believe a catastrophic loss is unlikely due to Coinbase’s “advanced security measures,” the risk of custodial centralization remains a concern. The idea of a Bitcoin fork to recover lost assets—similar to the Ethereum situation following the DAO hack in 2016—has been suggested. However, experts believe that while influential stakeholders might push for a rollback to “recover” their funds, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin’s network would likely reject such proposals. Lisa Neigut, founder of Base58, explains that Bitcoin’s unique Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model creates a buffer against centralized risks. In this model, if a bug affects a particular entity’s keys, it only impacts that entity, preserving the overall integrity of the network. This separation of concerns is crucial for maintaining the health of the Bitcoin protocol, especially in the face of potential centralization threats. Yet, concerns persist about how large custodians like Coinbase could influence the broader ecosystem. Related Reading: Is Chainlink (LINK) $12 Breakout Imminent? Data Reveals A Rising Open Interest Armin Sabouri, CTO of Botanix Labs, warns that significant holders could coerce the community by threatening to dump their assets, potentially crashing the market price and forcing the network to ossify in response to their demands. This scenario poses a direct challenge to Bitcoin’s foundational ethos of decentralization. In sum, the sense of risk regarding the increased amount of holdings that the exchange poses remains a topic for debate in the future of the market. In addition, with the increased amount of methods to potentially hack or attempt to hack exchanges like Coinbase, it would be imperative to monitor and prevent these types of scenarios to avoid another Mt. Gox catastrophe. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $57,650, having failed to break above the $58,000 resistance level for two days in a row.
