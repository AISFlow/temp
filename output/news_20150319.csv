The microsite  enables users to filter the results by currencies and plots the data on a 3D interactive globe, offering behind-the-scenes insight into activities. At press time, the site showed that the storage platform held $1,259,153 in bitcoin in its wallets.  Speaking about the launch, Halsey Minor, founder and CEO, said that the new tool was in line what he believed to be the tenets of digital currency – inclusion, fairness and transparency.  The CEO and CNET founder, said that he hoped Changemoney.org would help more people understand the power and potential of digital money, adding:  ""Change money and the unbanked can become banked. Immigrants and the working poor can keep more of their hard-earned pay. Small businesses and startups can compete on a level payments playing field against corporate giants.""  ""Change money and the black-box model of today's banking sector can be replaced with a glass-house model defined by real-time transparency,"" he concluded.  Currency additions  The platform has also added two more currencies, the Indian rupee and the Mexican peso, raising the total available to eight, after its introduction of the Swiss franc in February.  The news comes after Bitreserve added three new precious metals to its bitcoin storage platform and five new languages – Mandarin, Japanese, English, Portuguese, Spanish and Russian.  Having introduced gold last year, the site allows its users to hold bitcoin pegged to silver, platinum or palladium since last month.  Bitreserve raised over $9m in a crowdfunding campaign earlier this year.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/19/bitreserve-tool-lets-you-watch-bitcoin-transactions-in-real-time,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22bd78f2303496f6f7c36e497e06a5975b256f11-1500x1000.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398275,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT5Rr,1426778726,Coinigy Raises $100k to Boost Bitcoin Trading Suite,"Coinigy has raised $100,000 in private seed funding to expand its suite of bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading tools.  Launched by former hobbyist traders William Kehl and Rob Borden, the US-based company allows users to aggregate pricing data at 24 bitcoin exchanges through a central interface that includes real-time charting and technical analysis features.  In addition to popular bitcoin exchanges such as Bitfinex and Coinbase, the platform also supports exchanges that trade more than 100 altcoins.  Kehl explained that Coinigy is designed to help traders better respond to changing market conditions, thereby allowing them to trade more effectively.  Kehl told CoinDesk:  “It's definitely a benefit to traders in terms of increasing their profitability. We offer special order types that most exchanges don't offer like trailing stops and stop losses, so those things can definitely help preserve profit.”  Borden added that Coinigy will be looking to use the funds, in part, to complete the development of Android and iOS apps that he estimated will be out within months.  “We definitely have in our plans in the near future to branch out. We're vetting translators at the moment,” he added.  Coinigy  is currently available in English and for desktops only.  Features  Coinigy’s co-founders discussed a range of features planned for the platform, including those available and soon-to-be released.  For instance, Coinigy now offers stop limits orders, and plans to introduce stop-loss orders and trailing stops that would be available on all its supported exchanges.  To access the service, users first need to supply Coinigy with their public and private API keys. “That gives them the ability to control the access of the site through our account, and at any time, they can disallow that access,” Borden added.  Coinigy does not hold any customer funds or keys, nor does it interrupt or bypass the anti-money laundering (AML) or know-your-customer (KYC) protections of the exchanges it supports.  Further, the founders sought to stress that they won’t be trading through the service owing to the conflict of interest that would arise.  “We want to make it clear we're not trading for profit on any of these exchanges as we are privy to user information,” Kehl added.  Competition  As with most entrepreneurs, Kehl was quick to point out the limitations of similar services currently available on the market.  The co-founder cited CrypTrader, Cryptowatch and Bitcoin Wisdom as similar projects that also provide real-time charting, news feeds and technical indicators, though he suggested they are limited in terms of the functionality they provide.  TradeBlock  , the data provider backed by Andreessen Horowitz, he suggested, is too focused on enterprise customers, leaving a gap Coinigy intends to exploit.  “TradeBlock could be considered a competitor, but they're mostly focused on institutional traders. We're catering to both institutional and average investors,” he said.  Coinigy intends to monetize its product through subscriptions to its platform, priced at roughly $280 at press time.

42398271,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT5Qs,1426769407,Intel Hints at Bitcoin Play With Crypto Researcher Hire,"California-based semiconductor manufacturer Intel appears to be dipping its toe in the digital currency space, following a bitcoin-related job posting.  The multinational company is looking for a cryptographic researcher to join its Special Innovation Projects Group, part of its in-house research organisation, Intel Labs.  An advertisement posted on job site Indeed notes the chosen candidate will be required to ""investigate hardware and software capabilities that advance the performance, robustness, and scalability of open, decentralised ledgers"".  It continues:  ""Working with a team of distributed systems, operating systems and security technologists you [the candidate] will focus on development of cutting-edge, cryptographic algorithms for improving [...] transaction verification within an open, decentralised ledger"".  The advertisement also mentions the potential of the blockchain beyond peer-to-peer bitcoin payments, referencing the ""many secondary uses that the research and startup community are exploring"" – also known as bitcoin 2.0.  Interest in bitcoin  While Intel is the latest multinational to have expressed interest in the bitcoin space, it's not the first.  As previously reported, IBM is rumoured to be creating a digital cash and payment system for traditional currencies that uses blockchain technologies.  In January the US-based tech giant also revealed its proof of concept for ADEPT, a system developed in partnership with Samsung that uses elements of bitcoin’s underlying design to build a distributed network of devices – a decentralised Internet of Things.

The platform, a subsidiary of Chinese exchange Huobi, said that the decision was taken ""due to a lack of user demand"", and the ""growing consensus that the world will only have one cryptocurrency value"".
