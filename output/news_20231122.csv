20562134,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561958,1700694052,Chainlink Retests $14: Here’s What Will Happen If Support Holds,"Chainlink has registered some drawdown and has recently retested the $14 level. Here’s what might happen if support holds at this mark. On-Chain Data Suggests Resistance Is Thin At Higher Chainlink Levels As pointed out by analyst Ali in a new post on X, Chainlink is currently in a critical on-chain demand zone. In on-chain analysis, a price range is defined as major support or resistance based on the number of investors or addresses that bought their coins inside the said range. To any holder, their cost basis is naturally fundamental, as their profit/loss situation can flip whenever the cryptocurrency retests it. For this reason, an investor becomes more likely to show a move whenever such a retest takes place. Related Reading: Has Bitcoin Reached “Euphoria” Yet? What On-Chain Data Says If the holder had earlier been holding a loss, but the price has now risen and reached its equilibrium point, they might lean towards selling. This is because they might fear their holdings would go into loss again shortly, so exiting at break-even wouldn’t sound like a bad idea. The opposite can be true when the retest occurs from above: the investor might be willing to buy more, thinking that if this same cost basis proved profitable earlier, it would do so again soon. A single investor making such buy or sell moves is insignificant for the rest of the market, but if many investors share the same cost basis, the asset could feel a sizeable reaction when the price retests the level. Now, here is a chart that shows how the Chainlink ranges around the current price look in terms of the density of investors who bought inside them: Looks like the ranges above are relatively thin with investors at the moment | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the Chainlink levels from $13.8 to $14.2 host the cost basis of about 11,470 addresses, which acquired 23.45 million LINK inside this range. This range is notably thicker than any other range immediately below or above the asset’s current price. LINK has been floating around this range recently, meaning it has been retesting this major support zone. From the chart, it’s apparent that the ranges above don’t contain that many investors, so in theory, a move toward the higher levels shouldn’t be too hard for the asset. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Chainlink Rally To $20 Based On This Pattern However, the trouble would be if this support area is lost and LINK slips under it for an extended duration. This dense zone will turn into a resistance wall if this happens, making it hard for the cryptocurrency to recover above it. Ali notes, though, that if Chainlink can remain above this zone, the price could climb towards new highs for the year 2023. LINK Price Chainlink had slipped below this range just earlier, but the asset was quick to recover above it, implying that it’s still holding up as support.

So far, recent on-chain data from Lookonchain, a renowned on-chain analytics platform, has unveiled a notable accumulation pattern in four specific altcoins. Maker (MKR), ssv.network (SSV), Coin98 (C98), and RSS3 have emerged as the latest targets of these accumulative efforts. The data shows a series of substantial withdrawals of altcoins from Binance, a leading crypto exchange, hinting at a growing interest in these altcoins among heavyweight investors. Notably, this trend of whale accumulation is not just a fleeting occurrence but a concerted effort that has been unfolding over recent months. Related Reading: Crypto Whales’ Big Bet: An Examination Of Their 3 New Altcoin Targets Diving Deep Into Whale Transactions: A Closer Look at the Accumulated Altcoins The analysis by Lookonchain reveals intriguing details about the accumulated assets. A new wallet, identified as “0xB4aE”, mainly made waves by withdrawing 10 million RSS3 tokens, valued at approximately $1.44 million, from the OKX exchange. This transaction underscores the growing interest in RSS3, a lesser-known crypto asset. In parallel, another prominent wallet, dubbed “0xb6a7”, substantially withdrew 114,227 SSV tokens from Binance, amounting to a value of about $1.93 million. 1/ We noticed that whale/fresh wallets are accumulating $MKR, $SSV, $C98 and $RSS3.👇 pic.twitter.com/AOIlNTVyux — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 22, 2023 This same investor also transferred 2.77 million C98 tokens from Binance, signaling a bullish stance on these specific altcoins. It is worth noting that these transactions exemplify the strategic moves by whales, often aimed at leveraging market dynamics to their advantage. The Maker (MKR) Movement: Whale “0x9e74 Leads the Charge One of the most significant players in this scenario is the whale wallet “0x9e74”. Since July 2023, this investor has consistently withdrawn Maker (MKR) tokens from Binance, totaling roughly 4,776 MKR. The most recent transaction involved moving $1.7 million worth of MKR from the exchange, bringing the total worth of MKR withdrawn by this investor to about $6.9 million. This consistent and targeted accumulation of MKR suggests a strong confidence in the future of this particular altcoin. The Maker token, part of the MakerDAO ecosystem, has been a subject of interest, mainly due to its role in decentralized finance (DeFi) as a lender. These large-scale movements by whales underscore a broader trend within the crypto world, where informed players are increasingly steering towards altcoins with strong fundamentals and potential for substantial growth. Related Reading: Pumping Altcoins All Have One Thing In Common: Crypto Whale Games Amid the accumulation of the altcoins above by whales, RSS3 and Maker are still the top gainers, with both altcoins seeing a surge in price by 34.8% and 10.7%, respectively, over the past two weeks. The remaining two altcoins, however, have seen slight gains and decline, with SSV seeing a mere 4.8% increase and C98 seeing an 8.6% plunge over the same period.

20558145,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561815,1700686828,"Bitcoin Bulls Buckle Up: Seasonal Trends Point To $50,000 Target","Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency on the market, has again failed to consolidate and reach the $38,000 level for the third time, as it is currently experiencing a 3% pullback. This has led the community to speculate that a significant retracement may occur before the bullish momentum resumes and the next uptrend begins. However, renowned crypto analyst Adrian Zduńczyk has recently shed light on Bitcoin’s potential next target of $50,000. Zduńczyk’s analysis considers several crucial factors, including the prevailing bullish market sentiment, the ongoing uptrend, the short-term outlook, miner sentiment, and seasonal trends. Evidence Of Dominant Bull Market Zduńczyk notes that the cryptocurrency industry is in a bull market, with Bitcoin reaching a new 52-week high close and experiencing the third wave of the bullish cycle. The correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 has risen, indicating a favorable environment for Bitcoin. High time frame trends are also rising. Zduńczyk identifies key macro support levels for Bitcoin at $29,000 and $27,000, highlighting growing demand fueled by the anticipation of the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the upcoming halving event expected in April 2024. Related Reading: Solana Captures Institutional Investors’ Attention, Inflows Rise To $135 Million Notably, the daily chart for BTC remains in an uptrend, according to Zduńczyk. He points to a target of $40,000, supported by the appearance of a “golden cross” pattern. Furthermore, Zduńczyk believes that the rising Simple Moving Average (SMA) 200 serves as “irrefutable evidence” of a dominant bull market since January. These indicators suggest a continuation of the upward trajectory for Bitcoin. Zduńczyk also identifies key support levels at $35,000 to $35,800, emphasizing that a bullish sentiment prevails as long as Bitcoin remains above these levels. Zduńczyk Eyes Bitcoin November Target Of $50,000 Currently, Bitcoin is ranging between $35,500 and $38,000, Zduńczyk notes that the momentum bands are widening, indicating an increase in volatility. The rising 50-day Average True Range (ATR) trend supports this observation. Fear & Greed Index stands at 69, indicating a mixed sentiment among market participants. Miners, on average, are enjoying a profit increase of 23%. Zduńczyk maintains a positive outlook based on these factors. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees A Whopping 48,000% Increase In The SHIB Burn Rate, What’s Next? Regarding seasonal trends, October demonstrated a gain of 27%, exceeding the average performance. Historically, November has been the best month for Bitcoin, which has an average gain of 43%, with a target of around $50,000. Notably, December typically adds 7% to November’s closing price. Currently, BTC is trading at $36,400, reflecting a 5% and 22% profit over the past fourteen and thirty days, respectively. The focus now shifts to whether BTC’s price can maintain its crucial support levels and sustain its bullish uptrend, potentially reaching the $50,000 milestone supported by historical patterns.

42419096,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDeV3,1700683561,Bitcoin's Anti-Censorship Ethos Surfaces After Mining Pool F2Pool Acknowledges 'Filter',"F2Pool, the third-biggest Bitcoin mining pool, drew ire on social media after a report that it might be censoring transactions from an address subject to U.S. government sanctions.  One of the F2Pool project's leaders subsequently appeared to confirm the report, stirring up controversy since ""censorship resistance"" is considered by many Bitcoiners to be a cardinal principle of the largest and original blockchain. At the same time, many government officials around the world have expressed concern that blockchain networks can be used to finance criminal activity and terrorism.  The Bitcoin development-focused blogger 0xB10C wrote Nov. 20 that his ""miningpool-observer"" project ""detected six missing transactions spending from OFAC-sanctioned addresses."" OFAC stands for the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a lead agency in U.S. government efforts to enforce economic sanctions.  A few of the instances ""are likely false-positives and not the result of filtering,"" the blogger wrote.  ""The transactions missing from F2Pool's blocks are, however, likely filtered,"" according to the piece, which was cross-posted to the website Stacker News.  Bitcoin mining pool  A Bitcoin mining pool is where operators working to confirm transactions on the network join together to coordinate their efforts and then share any resulting rewards – typically with the goal of providing a steadier income stream.  Because they end up controlling big chunks of the network's processing, or ""hashpower,"" their decisions can have broad ramifications. And participants in a mining pool can, relatively easily, switch to a different pool.  F2Pool is responsible for about 14% of mined Bitcoin blocks over the past year, the third-most after Foundry USA's 30% and AntPool's 22%, based on data from Blockchain.com.  F2Pool co-founder Chun Wang subsequently posted on X (formerly Twitter), ""Why do you feel surprised when I refuse to confirm transactions for those criminals, dictators and terrorists? I have every right not to confirm any transactions from Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, don’t I?"" The post has since been deleted.  Chun later wrote that ""a censorship-resistant system must be designed to resist censorship at the protocol level, rather than relying on each participant to act conscientiously and refrain from censorship.""  ""The Internet and TCP/IP have failed this,"" he added. ""Bitcoin should learn from the failure.""  A couple hours after that, Chun tweeted again, ""Will disable the tx filtering patch for now, until the community reaches a more comprehensive consensus on this topic."" The term ""tx"" is often used as shorthand for ""transaction.""  'Expect blowback'  Based on the replies on X, the community reaction was quite negative.  ""The community has been in consensus on this for a very long time. You don't do it,"" one poster wrote.  ""Expect blowback,"" a poster wrote.

Interestingly, he hints that the crypto token could reach unprecedented heights that will change the lives of Cardano holders. When ADA Price Will Rise To $11 In a video shared on YouTube, Gambardello sounded bullish about the future of ADA as the crypto industry awaits the next bull run. According to him, this is when ADA will rise to as high as $11 at a market cap of $400 billion market cap then. He hinted that this bull run is likely to happen after the next Bitcoin Halving event. Related Reading: Ethereum Still Bullish: Richest ETH Wallets Go On Massive $124 Billion Buying Spree The crypto founder also noted how the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape on the Cardano network has grown since the last bull run. As such, he expects that this “new ecosystem” powered by Shelley and innovations like the multi-asset ledger, positions the token for significant growth in the next bull run. Shelley is the Cardano era, which focused on making the network a decentralized economic system. Basically, Gambardello was alluding to the fact that Cardano has gotten better since the last bull run and now provides more utility to its users. To highlight ADA’s potential, he stated how the token rose from about $0.12 to $3 during the last bull run without having any of these “developmental milestones” in place. Therefore, a rise to $11 is feasible with the immense utility in place now. The Cardano-Ethereum Comparison Gambardello drew a comparison between Cardano and Ethereum. He went as far as asserting that the former was more sound, secure, and decentralized. Despite his assertion, he recognizes the fact Cardano is like a cycle behind Ethereum. In line with this, he expects that Cardano’s success is going to be similar to the one Ethereum enjoyed when it first established its DeFi ecosystem. Related Reading: Fetch AI Breakout Confirmed: Analysts Reveal Bullish Targets For FET Price The crypto analyst also mentioned how undervalued Cardano is while making a comparison between it and Ethereum. In his opinion, Cardano has everything something like Ethereum has but better. He also believes that the innovations on the Cardano network are happening in a more secure and decentralized way compared to its counterparts. C While Gambardello seems to think that ADA will perform so well in the next bull run, another crypto analyst will beg to differ. This crypto analyst happens to be Lady of Crypto, who once outlined five reasons why she doesn’t believe ADA will perform well during that period.

42419085,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDePt,1700681733,Binance Settlements Could End Death-Spiral Fears – And Might Be Good News,"Binance's expensive deal with U.S. prosecutors this week bears harsh consequences but could leave the world's largest crypto exchange with a brighter outlook going forward.  After a months-long investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, co-founder and CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao on Tuesday pleaded guilty to violating federal crimes and Binance cut a check worth $4 billion to U.S. lawmakers. CZ, who until Tuesday was one of the most powerful people in the crypto industry, agreed to step down.  All this might sound like a pretty bad outcome for the Hong Kong-based exchange, but it’s also an opportunity for a fresh start – possibly the best-case scenario for Binance, which had been haunted by market fears that U.S. authorities might deal a devastating blow.  “The settlement was the only option to continue the business,” said Ethan Silver, partner at law firm Lowenstein Sandler who co-chairs the firm’s crypto practice. “Presumably, they think the business will be able to be cleaned up and operate on a compliant basis going forward with a great opportunity to continue its significant monetization.”  For years, industry participants had accused Binance of cutting corners on regulatory matters or of various misdeeds, to the point where CZ established a way to refute rumors – by posting the number 4 on his social media. He said it stood for “Ignore FUD,” an expression in the industry used to describe when somebody spreads negative feelings about something – “fake news, attacks, etc.”  The company was also routinely skewered for what seemed like an ever-shifting account of the location of its corporate headquarters.  A criminal investigation as such could have had fatal consequences as seen in the case of collapsed crypto exchange FTX, which will likely result in the founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried going to prison for the rest of his life.  That episode sparked concerns that U.S. charges against Binance might trigger a deposit run, a potentially difficult-to-reverse downward spiral as users scrambled for the exit.  Binance settlement  So Binance’s deal with the DOJ – with no imminent signs of depositor flight or other distress – might be seen as a positive outcome, not just for CZ’s prospects for avoiding a lengthy prison sentence, but for the exchange’s business. (It's worth noting that the exchange also remains under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on allegations of violating federal securities laws.)  “Optimistically, this can be viewed as a removal of a long-standing overhang on the industry, one that kept many investors at bay,” Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at NYDIG wrote in a note.  The change in management, namely appointing Richard Teng, who formerly oversaw Binance’s regional business operations outside the U.S., as the new CEO, could help to turn the page.  Rajeev Bamra, head of DeFi and digital-assets strategy at Moody’s Investors Service, praised Teng’s extensive regulatory background and experience, in an emailed statement from the credit-rating firm. Teng's stepping in as the new leader of the exchange could provide an opportunity to move beyond regulatory concerns and “chart a path towards stability and a fresh beginning,” according to Bamra.  In the short term, Binance will likely lose some of its market share as a consequence of its compliance with regulators, Danny Lim, core contributer at MarginX, a perpetual decentralized exchange (DEX) said. Longer term, it could regain market dominance.  BNB token price  Binance has already taken hits in popularity this year, and even the market's reaction – or lack thereof – shows that this settlement isn't as big of a deal in the eyes of traders.  After a flurry of trading over the past couple days, the BNB [BNB] token, closely associated with Binance and its various sponsored blockchain networks, appears to have stabilized after and initial sell-off and is now holding at levels roughly where it has traded for the past few months – certainly no meltdown. BNB has a market capitalization is about $36 billion, ranking the token as the world's fourth-biggest digital asset.  Most recently, Binance was surpassed by regulated futures exchange Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as the leader in open interest on futures products.  But that flip might have been partly due to the clouds from the investigation – some of them now lifted.",POSITIVE,BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/11/22/binance-deal-with-doj-was-only-option-to-continue-the-business,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd05dc1130c8ad2f74b461577af9998960adc810-2043x1149.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto markets were initially buffeted Monday on the leak of a potential massive settlement of U.S. criminal charges against Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange. Confirmation on Tuesday of the $4.3 billion fine as well as a guilty plea by its founder and CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao – who also agreed to step away from the company – shook markets further, sending bitcoin plunging below $36,000 at one point that evening.  Markets have been bouncing since, though, with bitcoin now higher by about 1.5% over the past 24 hours and just shy of $37,400 after having begun the week at about $37,000.  The broader CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is ahead by more than 2% over the past 24 hours, led by a 5% gain for ether [ETH] and 6% advances for Solana [SOL] and Chainlink [LINK].  Stepping away from the headlines, a number of observers have noted that the Binance settlement in essence may have cleared the decks for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to finally approve a spot bitcoin ETF. The neutering of Binance and exit of CZ, they said, might have eased the agency's concerns regarding overseas manipulation of bitcoin prices.  ""With this plea deal, the expectations for a spot Bitcoin ETF might have increased to 100% as the industry will be forced to follow the rules that TradFi firms must follow,"" wrote crypto services provider Matrixport.

42409388,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcH90p,1700676304,"The Protocol: CZ's out, Altman's in, and Kraken's Sued","The tech news cycle this past week was dominated by the straight-out-of-HBO boardroom drama at OpenAI, but the crypto world – not to be outdone by its AI brethren – has brought its own bombshells.  The big story this week was around Binance, whose high-profile CEO, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, will be stepping down from his post at the company as part of a sweeping plea agreement with U.S. prosecutors. The world's largest crypto exchange, Binance will pay over $7 billion in fines to the U.S. Treasury and Commodity Futures Trading Commission in ""one of the largest penalties"" the U.S. has ever obtained from a corporate defendant – money that could help the industry avoid yet another blockbuster criminal trial. Zhao has long been a controversial figure in the crypto space – owing largely to the opaque nature of his exchange giant, whose centralized command structure and shadowy inner workings fly in the face of core blockchain tech principles around transparency and decentralization. But as Zhao's tenure at Binance was eulogized across X (formerly Twitter) this week, fans (and even some critics) credited him for spearheading a period of tremendous growth for the broader industry – even as it's now clear that Binance's own rise came at the cost of U.S. sanction-incompliance and in brazen defiance of money-transmitting laws.

Network news  ORACLES' NEED FOR SPEED: A single millisecond can make or break a trade in the world of traditional finance, but decentralized finance apps tend to operate on a much slower timescale – with certain market data taking minutes or even hours to populate on-chain. The year 2023 has marked a breakout in the race to provide lower-latency pricing data to blockchains, with oracle firms like Chainlink and Pyth Network duking it out in a battle to make on-chain trading more hospitable to speed-obsessed Wall Street speculators and high-frequency traders. Developers use oracles to shepherd off-chain data, like token prices, onto (or between) blockchains. The main issue until recently has been the inherent latency in decentralized networks, where geographically distributed nodes take time to reach consensus, leading to delays that can slow down data from oracles. Chainlink, a frontrunner in the oracle space, recently introduced Data Streams to reduce latency and operational costs, offering a pull-based oracle system that enhances efficiency. Pyth Network, an oracle firm that was in the news this week for its token airdrop, has also been an early mover in the latency race – it's been particularly active on the Solana blockchain, where it offers low-latency pricing data sourced directly from first-party financial firms. Other players in the oracle race include Band Protocol, Witnet, Tellor, XYO Network, Razor Network and WINkLink. A key focus for the sector moving forward will be reconciling tradeoffs between speed, reliability, and decentralization – a balancing act for virtually all crypto protocols, but one that's particularly prescient in the context of critical oracle infrastructure.  ALSO:  Sam Altman will be reinstated as CEO of OpenAI less than a week after his surprise-ouster by the artificial intelligence startup's board. Last week's firing of Altman, OpenAI's founder and Silicon Valley's chief AI visionary, upended the tech world and drove OpenAI employees into open revolt.  HTX, the crypto exchange previously known as Huobi, and Heco Chain, a related blockchain protocol, were hacked for a cumulative $97 million early on Wednesday. It's the second major hack this month to hit the crypto empire of Justin Sun, the TRON blockchain founder who serves as an ""advisor"" to Huobi.  Bittrex Global, the crypto exchange that shuttered its U.S. arm last May after incurring a $24 million fine from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, is winding down the whole of its operations.  Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, has frozen $225 million worth of its USDT stablecoin following an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) into an international human trafficking syndicate in Southeast Asia.  Santander Private Banking International, part of Spanish financial services giant Banco Santander, is offering high-net-worth clients with Swiss accounts trading and investing in the major cryptocurrencies bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), according to an internal announcement seen by CoinDesk.  Protocol Village  Highlighting blockchain tech upgrades and developments.  1. Fhenix, which announced a $7M fundraising in September to build a ""confidential blockchain"" powered by fully homomorphic encryption or (FHE), disclosed Thursday that it is ""introducing FHE Rollups to boost privacy on Ethereum and similar networks."" According to a message from the team: ""These rollups enable secure on-chain transactions and private applications, letting developers craft confidential layer-2 networks while staying compatible with Ethereum."" Fhenix founder Guy Zyskind told CoinDesk in an interview that ""We're going to have our canonical Fhenix L2 mainnet,"" but also ""We're trying to be the encrypted rollup stack"" that builders can use to create their own networks.  2. DLN, which stands for deSwap Liquidity Network, a cross-chain trading infrastructure build on deBridge, has entered into a strategic partnership with bloXroute, a DeFi performance provider, ""to provide MEV searchers, institutional DeFi traders and projects with lightning-fast intents-based cross-chain value exchange,"" according to the team. (EDITOR'S NOTE: Please go here for my piece last week on what ""intents"" are and why they're becoming an important design concept in blockchain technology.)  3.

Money Center  Funraisings  Colony Lab, an Avalanche ecosystem developer and accelerator, said it will invest $10 million to support the long-term growth of the network.  Taproot Wizards, a Bitcoin-focused Ordinals project, raised $7.5 million in seed funding to try and ""make bitcoin magical again.""  Privy, a crypto startup focused on consumer tools, has raised $18 million in a Series A round led by Paradigm, with participation from earlier investors including Sequoia Capital, BlueYard Capital and Archetype, according to a blog post.  Union Labs, which aims to create an efficient zero-knowledge interoperability layer, has successfully raised $4 million in seed funding to build the ""first fully trustless bridge that connects appchains, layer-1, and layer-2 networks,"" according to the team.  Deals and grants  As the designated blockchain sponsor in Alibaba Cloud’s Innovation Accelerator program, the Aptos Foundation will provide builder resources and ecosystem fund support to promising Aptos-built projects, according to the team.  After many months on the auction block, CoinDesk gets acquired by Bullish from Digital Currency Group.  Data and tokens  Ordinals Protocol tokens, a growing class of digital assets based on the Bitcoin blockchain, have gained hype amid mounting speculation that a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund might soon earn approval. The sector's market cap increased by 21% in a 24-hour period late last week, with tokens TRAC, MEME and NALS leading the gains.  Polygon, the Ethereum side-chain, saw gas fees spike 1000x due to a flurry of activity around its own Ordinals-inspired ""POLS"" tokens, according to Cointelegraph.  Bitcoin gained nearly 3% on the news that Javier Milei, a far-right ""anarcho-captalist"" and self-avowed blockchain supporter, had won a closely-watched runoff election to become Argentina's next president.  Regulatory, Policy, and Legal  Binance, the largest crypto exchange, has made settlement deals with the U.S. Justice Department and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that will allow it to avoid a lengthy court battle in exchange for fines topping $7 billion.  Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Binance's high-profile CEO, has pleaded guilty to violating U.S. criminal anti-money-laundering charges and has stepped down from his role at the company.  Kraken, another leading crypto exchange, has been accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of operating an unregistered platform and improperly mixing customer funds.

Binance Fundamentals Shows Strength Amid Challenges, New CEO Earlier today, the new Binance CEO confidently revealed the fundamental strength of the crypto company despite recent challenges. The CEO took to his official X (formerly Twitter) handle to share his belief in the company. According to Teng, the fundamentals of the company’s business are still solid. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Plunge Due to Binance’s Settlement Could Be ‘Buy Dips’ – Here’s Why Furthermore, the CEO has asserted that the company will continue to operate as the biggest crypto exchange in the world. Teng pointed out several areas that will enable the company to hold on to its position in the crypto market. These include its debt-free capital structure, modest expenses, and robust revenues and profits. Teng said: Binance continues to operate the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, our capital structure is debt-free, expenses are modest, and, despite the low fees we charge our users, we have robust revenues and profits. Richard Teng’s X post responded to another X post by a user highlighting Binance’s revenue due to the DOJ’s $4 billion fine. According to the user, the company has no “problem paying the fine, as its total assets are valued at approximately $6.35 billion.” In addition, the crypto company also holds about $3.19 billion worth of Stablecoins. Interestingly, the mentioned funds do not include off-chain cash balances or funds kept in wallets outside the Proof of Reserve (PoR). The post read: I backed out Binance Corporate’s crypto holdings from their Proof of Reserves: $6.35B in total assets, and $3.19B in stablecoins. Doesn’t include off-chain cash balances or funds held in wallets, not in PoR. Most likely able to pay the full $4.3B DoJ fine with 0 crypto asset sales. Changpeng CZ Zhao Pleads Guilty To Crime This is so significant that despite the craze following former Binance’s CEO Changpeng CZ Zhao, the company remains strong, according to the new CEO. Changpeng was charged with US money laundering, of which he has recently pleaded guilty to the charge. Furthermore, the former CEO has agreed to pay about $50 million as part of his plea.

The influx of investors pushed Blast’s Total Value Locked (TVL) to $81 million in a single day. “23,368 users have joined the Blast Community in the past 24 hours. Thanks to them, Blast has reached $81 Million in TVL in one day! We’re excited to share more with community members soon. There’s much more to come,” Blast said. Presently, Blast has recorded over $123 million in TVL from assets bridged by investors. This unexpected surge in bridging demands has raised concerns especially due to the unusual conditions attached to the bridging process. Source: DeFiLlama According to Blast, users can only access the Ethereum L2 network after receiving an invitation code. The network has also stated that users will not be able to withdraw their bridged funds until February 2024. While the unconventional bridging conditions have raised some red flags, many investors continue to express their interest by actively bridging their assets Details About New Ethereum L2 Network Blast has outlined several important details of its bridging and staking processes. The Ethereum L2 network highlighted the potential yield benefits of investors when they bridge their ETH tokens and stablecoins. The network has also stated that investors who stake their ETH can gain profits over time as their assets grow in their Blast wallets. “Once you have access, you can bridge to earn yield (4% for ETH + 5% for stablecoins) and Blast Points ahead of the Mainnet launch in February (2024). Early access members get more points based on how much they bridge and who they invite,” Blast stated. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Supply Drops To 5-Year Lows, What This Means For Price The L2 network added: Specifically, Blast natively participates in ETH staking, and the staking yield is passed back to the L2’s users and dapps. We’ve redesigned the L2 from the ground up so that if you have 1 ETH in your wallet on Blast, over time it grows to 1.04, 1.08, 1.12 ETH automatically. Additionally, Blast has expanded its bridging capabilities to a diverse range of digital assets. According to the L2 network, investors can bridge beyond ETH and opt for stablecoins such as USDT, DAI, and more. “It’s not just ETH on Blast that earns yield. Stablecoins do too. When you bridge stablecoins like USDC, USDT, and DAI to Blast, it’s deposited in on-chain T-Bill protocols like MakerDAO, and the yield is passed back to Blast users via USDB, Blast’s auto-rebasing stablecoin,” Blast stated.

42409403,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcH9bC,1700671500,Why On-Chain Transaction Is the Key Blockchain Indicator,"On-chain transaction volume is the pulse of blockchain networks. For digital asset investors, monitoring these flows within the network and comparing them across protocols is a way to ascertain adoption rates and utility of the protocol, and determine whether a project is further developing, or an obsolete relic of the previous market cycle.  This perspective gives us valuable insights into user activity, network utility, and the overall health of the crypto ecosystem. A surge in transaction volume often signifies increased network usage, adoption and trading activity. It could indicate growing interest, new protocol utility, or even speculative fervor. Conversely, a decline in on-chain transaction volumes might signal reduced network development, protocol stagnation or loss in market share to other competitors.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Several factors drive blockchain trading volume, and understanding these nuances helps us navigate the ever-evolving crypto market cycle. During bullish phases, when the crypto market resembles a bullish festival of excess, trading volumes tend to surge. Positive news, like regulatory clarity, institutional adoption or significant protocol upgrades, can spark heightened trading activity.  Additionally, market sentiment plays a crucial role. Bullish sentiment often drives traders and investors to flock to decentralized exchanges, causing a surge in transactions on-chain. There, they tend to be more focused on trading newer innovative products such as NFTs and smaller token launches, which have a greater impact on on-chain activity than major tokens traded within centralized exchanges. This contributes to increased trading volumes during bullish cycles.  Conversely, during bearish periods, trading volumes start to dwindle, with bursts of activity around periods of deleveraging. Uncertainty, negative news, regulatory crackdowns, or market corrections often lead to a decline in trading. Investors might adopt a wait-and-see approach, leading to decreased transaction volumes, and they might move their assets to cold storage or stablecoins, reducing the overall trading activity on exchanges.  To better dig into the usefulness of on-chain transaction volume data, we use data provided by Sonarverse, which provides OnChain Trading Dollar Volume by protocol, and compare volume across Bitcoin, Ethereum and Polygon protocols.  To normalize the volume across these protocols, we divide the transaction volume by market capitalization of the protocol. (see Figure 1 below)  Figure 1: On-Chain Trading Volume / Market Capitalization, by protocol, 30d smoothed, Source: Sonarverse, CoinDesk Indices Research  Here, we can see the relatively low and steady transaction volume of bitcoin, with Ethereum and Polygon having peaky and relatively offsetting activity, which makes sense given that Polygon is an EVM scaling solution for Ethereum based protocols.  To further highlight the investment benefits of this data, we run a very simple backtest, where we rotate across Ethereum and Polygon protocols based on recent normalized on-chain volume activity with the simple rule that when normalized Polygon trading activity is greater than Ethereum we rotate into Polygon, otherwise we hold Ether token (see Figure 2 below for hypothetical backtest strategy).  The rotation strategy improves absolute and risk-adjusted returns over a crypto market cycle when compared to separate allocations to Ether and Polygon tokens. This outperformance could be due to the information contained within the on-chain trading volume metric, which tilts the hypothetical strategy towards protocols with greater recent activity, and by association, greater blockchain protocol demand.  Figure 2: Ether / Polygon Rotation Strategy, Long-Only. Source: Sonarverse, CoinDesk Indices Research  By understanding the dynamics of on-chain activity, we can better gauge market sentiment, and make more informed trading decisions by assessing underlying protocol health. During bullish phases, high trading volumes can signal potential profit-taking opportunities or heightened volatility. In bearish cycles, low volumes might indicate potential market bottoms or opportunities for accumulation.  Keeping an eye on on-chain transaction volumes and other blockchain metrics like TVL is like listening to the heartbeat of the crypto market, allowing investors to navigate its twists and turns caused by industry developments.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING,Todd Groth,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/22/why-on-chain-transaction-is-the-key-blockchain-indicator,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/55b5466094da142bae139f991a94e3610e749f9c-5184x3461.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42409395,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcH9Ny,1700671500,Tokenization and Real-World Assets Take Center Stage,"The asset tokenization and real-world asset (RWA) space caught the eye of retail and institutional capital investors in 2023 for its favorable blend of professionally-managed products and digital asset mechanics. Having advised 40-plus clients on tokenization strategies and issuances to date,we see the following key themes emerging in these markets in Q3 2023.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Blockchain Savings and Bottom-Line Improvements  For investors entering this space, the greatest efficiencies will come through end-to-end digital systems – meaning an on-chain lifecycle. That means savings in dollars or manual labor time relative to traditional processes. For example:  Goldman Sachs Digital Asset Platform (GS DAP) achieved 15 basis points in savings for its €100M digital bond issuance, resulting in €150K of added return passed onto Union Investment as the sole buyer.  J.P. Morgan’s Onyx Digital Assets (ODA) is projecting $20 million in savings on an expected $1 trillion in tokenized repo volume by the end of 2023.  Broadridge’s Distributed Ledger Repo (DLR) is saving sell-side clients like Societe Generale $1 million per 100,000 repo transactions.  Equilend launched 1Source as a distributed ledger-based securities lending solution to save the securities lending industry an estimated $100 million in collective costs.  Structured finance servicing platform Intain reports 100 basis points in savings by reducing SME loan lifecycle fees from 150 bps to 50 bps through Hyperledger and Avalanche blockchain solutions.  Vanguard is leveraging R3’s Corda through Grow Inc. to achieve straight-through processing saving 100 hours a week in labor.  Liquid Mortgage has reduced Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) reporting from 55 days to 30 minutes on the Stellar blockchain.  Money Markets and Treasuries as the Low-Hanging Fruit  Asset managers and issuers are familiarizing themselves with tokenization workflows by trialing money market and treasury products. These tokenized assets generate a yield that can be passed on to clients, fully on-chain.  While alternative product strategies, like Hamilton Lane’s digitally-native private equity share classes, are in the works, money markets yield ~5% annually in low risk segments. This asset class accumulated almost $700 million in on-chain capital by the end of Q3 2023, up almost 520% YTD.  Tokenized Product Distribution through Institutional Client Bases  One of the weak points in the tokenization industry to date is actual product distribution and capital syndication. Institutions are beginning to move beyond just tokenizing assets for operational uses and savings (repo, collateral management) and are now placing tokenized products with their own client bases as buyers.  Citi is one name leading the charge here, offering digital corporate bonds through Singapore’s BondbloX to its Southeast Asia private banking and wealth management clients. UBS built upon its previous $400+ million digital bond issue to high-net-worth clients with an Ethereum-based money market fund, also in Singapore.  As blue-chips like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs continue to develop their digital suites, expect their private banking, wealth & asset management, and alternatives teams to act as distribution channels unlocking serious capital that retail broker-dealers struggle to access.

42409392,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcH97R,1700668937,1 Way to Revive Dead NFT Wallets,"The nightmare of every NFT collector is losing their seed phrase. It’s hard to see a hacker steal your non-fungible tokens (NFTs), but it’s harder to see them sitting in a dead wallet, because you’ve got no one to blame but yourself.  Even worse, stolen NFTs can be recovered, but a dead wallet is forever. The NFTs are still yours, but you can’t sell them, because you can’t transfer them to a buyer’s wallet.  Brian Frye is a professor at the College of Law at the University of Kentucky, NFT artist and filmmaker.  So, how much is an NFT in a dead wallet worth? Everything and nothing. The NFT itself hasn’t changed, so presumably its value hasn’t changed either. After all, it still represents ownership of the same artwork. And yet, an NFT you can’t sell is functionally worthless. At least you can still enjoy the art?  While a dead wallet is a heartbreak for a collector, it could also be a headache for the collector’s heirs. There’s no sure way to abandon ownership of a dead wallet, so you own it until you die and it becomes part of your estate. And if your estate is large enough, it might be taxed on the value of the NFTs in the wallet, even though they can’t be sold. At least your heirs can break the chain by disclaiming the wallet.  Of course, this is a quintessential rich people problem. The federal estate tax exemption is currently $12.06 million for individuals and $24.12 million for married couples, so most of us have nothing to worry about. But sooner or later, a crypto billionaire is bound to leave a dead wallet stuffed with blue chip NFTs, and the taxman will come knocking.  What’s to be done? Is there any solution to this entirely theoretical but hopefully amusing problem? Maybe. But in order for it to make sense, you have to understand how property law perceives NFTs.  The asset doesn’t actually have any real market value, even though it theoretically should  One is the loneliest number  Legal scholars often describe property as “a bundle of sticks,” a metaphorical way of observing that property consists of a collection of discrete rights to use something. Each right is a stick in the bundle, and property owners can use those rights however they like. Among other things, property owners can remove sticks from the bundle of rights and license or transfer them.  But when it comes to NFTs, there’s usually only one stick: The right to transfer ownership. An NFT is essentially a cryptographic ledger entry that represents something other than a quantity of cryptocurrency. Ledger entries can represent literally anything, and NFTs are no exception. But most NFTs represent nominal “ownership” of a work of digital art.  What does that mean? Typically, artists create NFTs and simply declare that they represent ownership of artwork. And NFTs are valuable because the NFT market believes them. But most NFTs don’t give their owners any rights in the artwork they represent. The only thing NFT owners necessarily own is the right to transfer their NFT to someone else.  Apparently, that’s enough to make NFTs valuable. It shouldn’t come as a surprise. The only right art collectors have ever cared about is the right to transfer artwork. Everything else is surplusage. The only difference is that collectors transfer NFTs on the blockchain, rather than in person. Plus ça change.  And yet, sometimes the difference matters. It’s all well and good to transfer an NFT on the blockchain, until you can’t, because it’s in a dead wallet. From a legal perspective, you still own the NFT, because you still own the wallet, even though you can’t access it. But from the perspective of the NFT market, you don’t, because the only thing NFT collectors care about is whether you can transfer your NFT to their wallet.  Of course, property law says you can still transfer ownership of your NFT, simply by stating your intention to do so, irrespective of what the blockchain says. Unfortunately, the NFT market doesn’t value that kind of transfer, so the law doesn’t matter. Or at least, the law won’t help you find a buyer. But it might help in other ways.  Talking with the taxman about art  What about taxation? As Benjamin Franklin famously observed, “in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes.” But even their certainty is greatly exaggerated. After all, no one knows when their hour will come, and no one knows what the IRS will bill. At least the IRS provides a facsimile of due process.  See also: NFT Artist Brian Frye Wants You to Steal This Article  In any case, the taxation of NFTs is usually reasonably predictable. The IRS taxes art as “collectibles,” subject to a capital gain tax of 28%, and it taxes NFTs just like any other kind of art. So, if you sell an NFT for a profit, you have to pay a 28% tax on the capital gain. Expensive, but simple.  Owners of dead wallets are in luck when it comes to taxation. Sure, they can’t sell their NFTs for a profit, which is a major bummer. But if you can’t make a profit, there’s nothing to tax. Take that, Uncle Sam. But what happens when owners of dead wallets die? And what happens when a wallet dies with its owner?  Posthumous tokens  Imagine a wealthy NFT collector dies, leaving a wallet full of valuable NFTs. Under the law of succession, the wallet becomes part of the collector’s estate and passes to the collector’s heirs. But what if it’s a dead wallet? The IRS doesn’t care. The NFTs are still part of the estate and are still subject to estate tax, even though they can’t be sold. It sounds absurd, but we know it’s true, because it’s happened.  In 1959, Robert Rauschenberg created a “combine” or sculptural painting he titled “Canyon.” Among many other things, “Canyon” incorporated a stuffed golden eagle that Sari Dienes found in the trash and gave to Rauschenberg. Later that year, Rauschenberg showed the painting at the Leo Castelli Gallery, and art dealer Ileana Sonnabend bought it.  It was a coup for Sonnabend, because “Canyon” is widely considered one of Rauschenberg’s most important works. She exhibited it throughout the United States and Europe, including at the 1964 Venice Biennale, where Rauschenberg won the grand prize for a foreign artist. But her coup eventually became a catastrophe.  Enter the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which became aware of “Canyon” in 1981, when Sonnabend shipped it back to the United States. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940 prohibits the possession or sale of eagle carcasses, with very limited exceptions. In a nutshell, “Canyon” is illegal.  With Raushenberg’s help, Sonnabend got a special permit that allowed her to keep the eagle carcass. She still couldn’t sell “Canyon,” so instead she loaned it to museums, including the Baltimore Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan. Problem solved, at least temporarily.  But when Sonnabend died in 2007, the bird came back. She left an estate worth more than $1 billion to her children Nina Sundell and Antonio Homem, which consisted primarily of artworks, including ""Canyon."" The estate sold about $600 million worth of art in order to pay estate taxes, but it couldn’t sell “Canyon,” because of the eagle. So it valued the work at $0, because an artwork you can’t sell is worthless.  Owners of dead wallets are in luck when it comes to taxation...[I]f you can’t make a profit, there’s nothing to tax.  The IRS disagreed. It appraised ""Canyon"" at $65 million and assessed $29.2 million in estate tax. Unsurprisingly, the Sonnabend heirs objected, and the IRS eventually agreed to forgive the bill if the estate donated “Canyon” to a charity. So the heirs gave it to the Museum of Modern Art, and the problem was solved for good.  See also: Crypto Tax Basics: A 101 for Beginners  The Sonnabend saga is instructive primarily because it’s so absurd. The outcome was preordained, the heirs just didn’t want to accept it, and the IRS was too sclerotic to explain its expectations.  I assume (or at least hope!) the IRS will treat dead wallets the same way. An estate can’t sell the NFTs in a dead wallet. But there’s no reason it can’t transfer ownership of the wallet to a charity and avoid taxation.  Last year, my CoinDesk Tax Week op-ed focused on donating NFTs to art museums. Among other things, I observed that eligible NFT donors can take a charitable contribution deduction, and reflected on how to value donated NFTs for tax purposes. And in another CoinDesk op-ed, I argued that NFT collectors can donate dead wallets for a deduction. After all, they still own the wallet, even though they can’t use it.  Candidly, I’m a little skeptical the IRS will allow NFT collectors to take a charitable contribution deduction for donating a dead wallet. It’s too clever by half, because the asset doesn’t actually have any real market value, even though it theoretically should. But if the IRS values dead wallets at $0 for the purpose of the charitable contribution deduction, it ought to value them at $0 for the purpose of the estate tax as well.

20548716,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561942,1700668815,Panic At Binance Following CZ’s Departure? Analyzing 24-Hour Inflow and Outflow Trends,"A new era for the crypto industry approaches as the world’s largest exchange, Binance, changes leadership. Yesterday, the company’s founder and CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, stepped down as part of an agreement with the US government. Related Reading: Spot Bitcoin ETF Odds ‘Might Have Increased To 100%’: Matrixport The deal might have sparked a new era of adoption and legitimacy for the nascent industry at the cost of CZ’s position and a $4 billion fine. Fresh data looked into Binance’s transactions to check if users believe in the company’s future following the historic decision. Binance Safe From FTX Like Bank Run? According to crypto analysis firm Nansen data, Binance recorded almost $1 billion in negative netflow following yesterday’s news. The data indicates that the platform’s USDT value decreased by $246 million, followed by Bitcoin’s value, which declined by $76 million. Users who feel uncertain about the platform’s future withdraw their money, potentially triggering a bank run. However, Nansen’s data shows that this scenario is far from materializing in this trading venue. While the negative netflows stand at $955 million, there is no “mass exodus” or panic from users trading on Binance. Nansen claims the platform’s holding value increased from $64.6 billion to $65.2 billion. The analytics firm previously stated that Binance handled bigger net flows. First, when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against the company, and later, when FTX went bankrupt following a massive bank run. As mentioned, Binance seems unlikely to follow a similar fate. Nansen stated: In the past, Binance has processed higher volumes of outflow and negative netflow: Jun 2023 after the SEC sued Binance, December 2022 after insolvency rumors, and the immediate aftermath of FTX. We will provide another update 24 hours after the news originally broke. CZ’s Departure Forecast Good Times For Crypto Across the crypto community, the debate around CZ’s departure has been fierce. However, the consensus is optimistic. A report from The Block cites major banking institution JPMorgan claiming that the Binance deal removes a “systemic risk” for the industry. In 2022, when FTX collapsed, the price of Bitcoin crashed to a low of $15,000 and took months to recover. With 150 million users on its platform and millions of capital injected into multiple ecosystems. Binance’s collapse would have been equally, if not more, catastrophic than FTX for the nascent industry. Related Reading: Binance Drama Causes Crypto Prices To Dance On The Edge – Details JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtziglou told The Block: We see the prospect of settlement as positive as uncertainty around Binance itself would subside and its trading and Smart Chain business would benefit.

After surging immediately following its launch, its figures dropped as interest waned. However, there has been a change in the performance as transaction numbers are spiking once again. Transaction Numbers Jump 288% On Shibarium In the last few days, there has been a marked increase in the number of transactions carried out on the Shibarium network. The Shiba Inu Layer 2 blockchain saw a nice jump from November 19 to November 22. Related Reading: Did JPMorgan Secretly Buy 7.5 Million XRP? Here’s What We Know On November 19, the total number of transactions on the network was 8,930. But as of November 22, this figure is sitting at an impressive 34,670 transactions. This represents a 288% increase in the space of three days. As a result, the total number of transactions carried out on the network since inception has now crossed 3.578 million. Transaction numbers spike 288% | Source: ShibariumScan There was also a small uptick in the number of active accounts on the network, albeit to a smaller extent compared to the transaction count. Active accounts went from 569 on November 20 to 648 on November 22. However, amid all of these, the amount of new blocks created on the network took a nosedive. Between November 20 and November 22, the number of new blocks created on Shibarium went from 17,214 to 13,907, a 20% decrease in two days. SHIB price crashes alongside Bitcoin | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com Why Is Shiba Inu Price Down? Despite the immense growth recorded in the Shibarium over the last few days, the Shiba Inu price has not followed this trend. Rather, the meme coin is seeing losses, especially on the 24-hour chart and this can be attributed to the general crypto market downtrend. Related Reading: AVAX Open Interest Climbs 10.4% To $224 Million, Is $30 Possible? The crypto market saw a crash after Changpeng Zhao announced he would be stepping down as the CEO of Binance and that the exchange had agreed to a $4 billion fine with the DOJ. As a result, the price of Bitcoin dropped from above $36,000 to mid-$35,000s before recovery. However, the damage was already done and it dragged the altcoin market down with it. Currently, the price of Shiba Inu is down 3.62% to trade at $0.000008061. This decline follows the Bitcoin trend, suggesting that a recovery in the Bitcoin price would translate into a recovery in the Shiba Inu price as well.

XRP To Enter The $1.2 Quadrillion Derivatives Market Earlier in August 2023, Ripple, a crypto payments solution, announced its membership with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA). The strategic move came as a pleasant surprise to XRP community members, as it positioned XRP to fully partake in the massive $1.2 quadrillion derivatives market. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Supply Drops To 5-Year Lows, What This Means For Price Ripple’s entry into this prestigious club is seen as a significant milestone, allowing the crypto payments company to stand alongside financial giants such as J.P Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and the London Stock Exchange. Many XRP enthusiasts are looking forward to a bullish outlook for the XRP token. Some have even mulled over the possibility of XRP breaching the $100 threshold. These expectations are fueled by considerations that a successful performance in the derivatives market could serve as a catalyst for significant price movement in the cryptocurrency. Presently, the price of XRP has not shown any notable price growth, even with speculation that a Ripple IPO is imminent. Nevertheless, enthusiasts remain vigilant, closely observing the cryptocurrency for any developments that could propel its price upwards. A $100 milestone, if achieved, has the potential to further strengthen the altcoin’s position in the crypto space. Prediction Suggests $100 Price Increase The potential Ripple Initial Public Offering (IPO) and the near resolution of the lawsuit between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have generated positive sentiment about XRP’s future price. Some analysts have predicted large-scale price increases as high as $5,000 for a single XRP token in the future. Related Reading: Global Banks Are Betting Big On XRP, Report Shows One notable prediction by an X (formerly Twitter) influencer stated the price of the token was poised to reach $100. He used metrics from Bitcoin’s upsurge from $0.01 to $69,000 in 2021 as a basis for his prediction, highlighting the unpredictability of cryptocurrencies skyrocketing. There have been other recent price predictions that show XRP projecting to $10. Changelly predicts that the altcoin’s price will breach its previous all-time high by 2027, and expects that the token’s price will rise above $10 by 2030. The price of XRP, at the time of writing, is trading at $0.595 according to CoinMarketCap. The price value is more than 83% below its all-time high of $3.84 in 2018.

42409398,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcH9RH,1700658850,"First Mover Americas: Binance, Binance, Binance","This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, was criminally charged with breaking sanctions and money-transmitting laws and agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement in ""one of the largest penalties"" the U.S. has ever obtained from a corporate defendant. Founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao pleaded guilty in Seattle to charges he personally faced, agreeing to pay a $50 million fine and step down as CEO. Richard Teng, a former Abu Dhabi regulator and later Binance's regional markets head, will replace him. Binance was accused of failing to maintain a proper anti-money laundering program, operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and violating sanctions law, according to a court filing unsealed on Tuesday.  Binance's initial growth was illegally fueled by its U.S. clients, the charging document alleged. In its early days, the exchange relied on Americans for the bulk of its revenue, its trading activity and thus its status as the world's largest crypto exchange. The filing details years of compliance failures and obfuscation in the name of protecting those most valuable – and off-limits – users. But servicing those customers wasn't legal because Binance wasn't a registered U.S. business, according to the government. Binance targeted growth in the country, especially among ""VIP"" users who drove the exchange's trading volume and thus its revenue, helping it become a crypto-trading juggernaut. According to the government, Binance's executives ""tracked and monitored"" the exchange's U.S. performance and even touted their success. As much as 30% of the exchange's web traffic (and just as much revenue) originated in the U.S. in early 2018, the filing said.  Following the news, Binance saw over $950 million in net outflows over the past 24 hours. “There are constant hourly net outflows of bitcoin and stablecoins after the CZ's resignation announcement,” Hochan Chung, head of marketing at CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk. “However, compared to the total reserves of Binance, the current volume is not yet significant at all.” Binance is set to continue operating as usual and make a ""complete exit"" from the U.S market. The withdrawals are above average, but not unusually large on a weekly basis, an analysis of net hourly flows from CryptoQuant shows. Data from a Dune Analytics dashboard shows over $2.37 billion in various tokens left the exchange and some $1.78 billion in tokens were deposited.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the number of YFI held in wallets tied to centralized cryptocurrency exchanges and YFI's price since early October. YFI is the native token of the Yearn Finance ecosystem.  The exchange balance surged in the four days to Nov. 14. YFI's price topped on Nov.17 and has crashed 50% since then.  The data highlights the importance of tracking exchange inflows as a barometer of potential increase in selling pressure.

Heco Chain was set up by HTX, which continued to be one of its maintainers. A HTX spokesperson told CoinDesk that HTX and Heco Chain operate independently.

20543451,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561908,1700658047,Has Bitcoin Reached “Euphoria” Yet? What On-Chain Data Says,"Here’s what on-chain data says regarding if the latest Bitcoin rally has hit the overheated “euphoria” stage where past bull runs topped out. Bitcoin Percent Supply In Profit Has Now Hit The 83% Mark In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the “euphoric” BTC phase from the angle of investor profitability. Euphoria basically refers to that period of the market where the investors have started embracing greed and the rally is becoming heated. Historically, the major rallies in the asset have attained their tops in such market conditions. To define what constitutes euphoria, Glassnode has referred to the “percent supply in profit” metric. This indicator keeps track of the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply that’s currently being held at a profit. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Chainlink Rally To $20 Based On This Pattern Here is a chart that shows the trend in this indicator over the past decade: The value of the metric seems to have observed a large spike in recent days | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 47, 2023 As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin percent supply in profit has naturally shot up as the latest rally in the cryptocurrency has occurred and the metric’s value is now floating around the 83% mark. The all-time mean of the metric is 74%, so the current levels are notably above this level. In the chart, the analytics firm has also marked the +1 standard deviation line for the indicator, above which the market can be thought to have entered into the early stages of the euphoria phase. The +1 standard deviation line for the metric is around 90%, so the current profitability levels are still below the mark but are nonetheless quickly closing in the gap. As mentioned before, these profitability levels are in terms of the supply or the coins, calculated by checking for the number of tokens that have their cost basis below the current spot price. There is another way to gauge profitability, however, and it’s the magnitude of the profits that these coins are combined are seeing right now. This unrealized profit is naturally calculated by subtracting the cost basis of each coin from the current spot price and summing up these differences for the entire supply in profit. The data for the unrealized profit over the past decade | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 47, 2023 “For the analysis of investor behavior, often the unrealized profit is a more critical variable as it relates back to the USD-denominated profit of investor positions,” explains Glassnode. Related Reading: Solana Forms Sell Signal, Decline To $30 Ahead? From the graph, it’s visible that the +1 standard deviation line for this Bitcoin indicator is still quite a distance away from the current value, meaning the coin is far from reaching the euphoric state of the bull market. “This suggests that whilst a significant volume of the supply is in profit, most have a cost basis, which is only moderately below the current spot price,” notes the report. BTC Price Bitcoin has gone through some volatility over the past day following the news of Changpeng Zhao (CZ) stepping down as Binance’s CEO. The asset had earlier slipped below the $36,000 level but has since recovered back to $36,600.

But the bullish sentiment has been in the works for months, and the ETF approval was merely a catalyst. Bitcoin has two correlating technical chart patterns showing new all-time highs to come, while the 2024 ETF approvals won't be able to play a liquidity factor. There's always news surrounding Bitcoin (BTC-USD), supposedly accounting for where it's headed or why it's up or down. Not long ago, Bitcoin was banned in China, and many thought it was the end of the cryptocurrency, or at least it was headed perpetually lower - how'd that turn out? There were other times when the lead crypto was in the running for new ETFs, and the price did nothing more than fizzle. Now, the latest news is spot price ETFs of Bitcoin - and even Ethereum (ETH-USD) - are on the horizon after the SEC lost a lawsuit where approval of a Bitcoin ETF was the centerpiece. Some are now attributing Bitcoin's rise leading up to and from here to the ETF ruling. But the fact is Bitcoin has been making headway toward higher highs for months now. News has never made a difference to Bitcoin's direction. Forget The News Cycle It wasn't long ago - in fact, 2021 - when I described much of what was happening with Bitcoin's historic rise was due to accumulation, and the news cycle was irrelevant to indicate which direction Bitcoin was headed. It's no more apparent with the entire fiasco of China banning, then not banning, then actually banning the mining of Bitcoin within the country. The price of Bitcoin couldn't have cared less. Here's what I said in that article: China had threatened to ban Bitcoin exchanges and mining in general as early as 2017 . Bitcoin was around $4,000 at the time. Then, when China followed through on those threats in June last year, Bitcoin was about $35,000. When it was all said in done, and China had ordered all things crypto banned, the coin was on its way to new highs at $69,000. With the hash rate in China near zilch, the crypto was still notching new gains. A little counterintuitive, don't you think? If you think you can bet on or bet against Bitcoin based on the logic of the news, you'll lose quite a bit of money. And now, the latest news is the pathway to a spot price Bitcoin ETF has finally opened - the long-sought-after crown jewel of mass adoption of crypto investing; buy it in your kid's account, your retirement account, or your 401(k), the possibilities are endless. And you might say Bitcoin has jumped quite a bit since this news, so the rally must be due to it. Data by YCharts And while it has jumped 40% as of this week since the SEC has decided not to appeal the decision, Bitcoin's movements were already in motion beforehand - and not on just one technical chart picture either. The Chart Technicals Were Already Telling You In the first chart picture, I look at the wave count in Elliot Wave Theory and see the structure had been forming back to late 2022. Since November last year, the crypto made a five-wave-up move to complete wave I. Then most of 2022 has been dedicated to wave II forming. And even in that timeframe, the news didn't initiate wave III. In fact, the ETF news didn't show up until after wave 2 of III was complete. Chart from stockcharts.com, annotations mine Did the news trigger buying? Sure, there's no arguing it was a catalyst for the recent move. But this catalyst had no guarantee of going higher, much like the talk many months and years ago for ETFs didn't facilitate anything material. And just like the China mining ban preceded a massive rally to all-time highs, this news could have started a selloff after years of anticipation of this moment of impending approval. In addition to this chart analysis, I also like to see accumulation, one of the main points in my 2021 article, which led to further upside to the $69,000 high. And over the last month, accumulation has increased quite a bit. Chart from stockcharts.com, annotations mine The point is this recent two-month rally was well telegraphed before the ETF decision news hit the wire. And it should continue on its already mapped-out path toward last year's high as wave III completes around $70,000 regardless of the news cycle. But, if you're still not seeing the big picture, look at the cup and handle pattern I've been tracking since the early days of the summer. This pattern has been in play since the $69,000 highs tagged a year ago. Obviously, it couldn't be seen as a pattern until it formed further, but I noticed it earlier this year, and there's corroboration between the Elliot Wave Theory pattern targets and the traditional technical chart analysis below. Chart from stockcharts.com, annotations mine What this cup shows is it's targeting the prior highs near $69,000. It may not reach it entirely as cup and handle patterns can look ""lopsided"" on the cup when complete, but over $60,000 would be considered complete on the cup end of things, give or take a thousand. Then, correlating with the EWT wave IV move, the handle should form, bringing it back to the $50,000 range, depending on where the right side of the cup tops, before breaking the highs. Once the highs are broken, it'll lead to the target of the cup somewhere between $95,000 and $110,000, depending on where the cup completes, how far the handle retraces, and the breakout point of the handle. Will Remain Divorced From The Effects Of The ETFs Some may say this technical chart picture will be due to the added liquidity of spot price ETFs coming online, but Bitcoin may complete most of this rally without a spot ETF ever rolling out to the market. Considering experts don't expect the first Bitcoin spot price ETF to debut until early 2024 , Bitcoin's rally to $69,000 may have nothing to do with the ETFs. I mean, how do no new investment vehicles help liquidity or buyers enter the market? It doesn't, which reinforces the point the catalyst is just that, a catalyst for movement. News doesn't correlate to the direction or magnitude of a move. It may trigger a move, but the rest is based on the sentiment already in play on the asset in question. And with quite a bit of corroborating evidence of sentiment already a tailwind for bulls after a bearish 2022, the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024 may make history for Bitcoin once again. Therefore, don't follow the news; follow the chart. The sentiment of Bitcoin is improving, and while there's still quite a bit of movement to occur, the path has been laid out.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4653399-bitcoin-on-its-way-to-all-time-highs-regardless-etf-approvals?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20543116.jpeg

Binance's exchange balances appear over collateralized - though caution with these sorts of things should always be considered. BNB valuations are higher than peers and DAU share seems to be moving to Tron. I think things get uncomfortable quickly if BNB breaks $200. I'm avoiding it. In what may not come as surprising news, top global crypto exchange Binance has reached a settlement with US regulators that will result in a $4.3 billion fine and the resignation of CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao. When I last covered the native asset of Binance's blockchain (BNB-USD) in July, I called the coin a ""sell"" and cautioned crypto investors about buying the dip down to $238. That sell call proved prescient as BNB fell to $205 shortly after the article was posted. Data by YCharts Even after a sizeable rally in BNB from $205 up to $270 more recently, BNB has still lagged the rallies seen in the native assets of large competing layer 1 smart contract chains like Ethereum (ETH-USD) and Tron (TRX-USD). Though Tron is the clear standout here and BNB has moved roughly in tandem with ETH. In this update, we'll look at some of the metrics related to Binance the blockchain network and Binance the exchange in an effort to assess if the worst might be over for BNB. Binance Proof of Reserves Given the fact that Binance settled on an enormous $4.3 billion fine, proof of reserves should be of particular interest going forward. To give some context as to how large this is, fellow crypto exchange Kraken settled with the SEC for $30 million earlier this year. However, Binance is a far larger exchange with more spot trading and a larger pool of capital. Binance PoR (Nansen) According to the addresses tracked by Nansen, Binance's exchange assets are slightly above $65.7 billion as of November 21st. At just 4.4% of total assets, Binance is not overly reliant on BNB token for reserves; this would be in contrast to what happened last November during the FTX/Alameda blowup. Looking at Binance's own proof of reserves , we can see each asset in the report is overcollateralized with stablecoins Tether (USDT-USD) and Binance USD (BUSD-USD) alone combining for over $3.2 billion in fund surplus: Asset Customer Net Binance Net Ratio Surplus Value BTC 584,659 609,311 104.2% $909,614,333 ETH 3,916,289 4,119,860 105.2% $405,432,368 BNB 31,216,990 34,780,091 111.4% $860,702,564 USDT 15,270,122,379 18,146,029,534 118.8% $2,875,907,155 BUSD 835,359,336 1,116,058,373 133.6% $280,626,897 Source: Binance Factoring in Binance's Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ETH assets, the company could pay the DOJ fine in full today even though it doesn't have to. This may be a big ask, but if we assume Binance's net figures are correct, the ""bank run"" scenario may not be likely based on what is publicly available. However, I want to make it clear that I personally advocate for self-storage over keeping large crypto balances with centralized exchanges. And I think it's very important that crypto market participants pay attention to Binance exchange flows in the weeks and months ahead. Exchange assets (CoinGlass) According to data from CoinGlass, the 24 hour crypto flows out of Binance are just under $567 million at this point in time. While this is not a small amount, adjusted for Binance's total assets on exchange, the recent outflow is roughly in line with OKX and Bitfinex. Month over month, Binance's net flows are still positive by $2.2 billion. Network Health From an investment standpoint, Binance's exchange balance and BNB positions are just half of the story. As a smart contract blockchain asset, BNB is both a governance and a gas token that theoretically benefits from the network effect of growth in chain usage. The token has also been deflationary through quarterly token burns going back to Q4-21: BNB Circulating Supply (Messari) From a DeFi perspective, the Total Value Locked story for BNB Chain leaves a bit to be desired: BNB TVL (DeFi Llama) At 11.2 million BNB locked, Binance Smart Chain has endured a 71% reduction in TVL. This is certainly not unique to Binance as most layer 1 chains have seen large declines in DeFi TVL. But by percentage, it's the weakest performance among the top 3 chains by TVL, of which Binance ranks third after Ethereum and Tron. Daily Active Users (Artemis) That said, Binance still has one of the top user bases judging by its nearly 1 million daily active users. This would put BNB ahead of Ethereum or Solana (SOL-USD) but notably behind Tron - which has seemingly taken share from BNB and Solana over the last two years. Finally, looking at network development, we see a big reduction in core developers and code commits over the last year: Core Developers (purple) vs Code Commits (green) (Token Terminal) This is certainly not unique to just Binance but with core devs getting chopped in half since March and code commits evaporating, it's not a pretty picture. Valuation As a smart contract blockchain, two of the valuation metrics we can look at are market cap to total value locked (or MC to TVL) and fully diluted price to fees. The MC to TVL ratio takes the total value of all of the BNB tokens and divides that market valuation by the value locked in the DeFi protocols on the chain. There is no standard threshold for when an MC/TVL ratio is considered too high, but Binance's is higher than peers: TVL Rank Chain TVL MC/TVL 1 Ethereum $24.486b 9.56 2 Tron $8.036b 1.06 3 Binance Smart Chain $2.842b 12.3 4 Arbitrum (ARB-USD) $2.091b 0.59 5 Polygon (MATIC-USD) $803.12m 8.47 Source: DeFi Llama BSC is the only chain in the top 5 with an MC/TVL ratio in double digits and after Solana's super rich 40.4 MC/TVL, Binance has the largest MC/TVL ratio in the top 10 DeFi chain rankings. That said, price to fees may be a more straightforward way to value these assets since smart contract chains may not necessarily be optimized for DeFi protocols. Fee Rank Chain Annual Fees ($m) Price to Fees 1 Ethereum $2,086.9 100x 2 Tron $899.1 7x 3 Bitcoin $430.7 596x 4 BSC $179.8 341x 5 Solana $15.5 1,098x Source: Token Terminal However, even here, Binance isn't necessarily cheap at 341x fees. When including all DeFi protocols in addition to the base layer chains, the median fully diluted price to fees ratio is 47x though base layer gas tokens generally trade at higher multiples. The more natural comp for BSC is likely Ethereum and BNB is 3 times more expensive based on fully diluted P/F ratio. Valuation isn't the only risk to consider. BNB's nearly 3-year long floor of $200 may be in jeopardy if the chain's usage continues to decline. Risks As I've said in the past with BNB, it's difficult to know exactly how much exposure Binance employees have to the token. This is very much a speculated risk from my April BNB article , but it's worth mentioning again: it has been estimated by independent analysts that Binance actually controls far more BNB than its proof of reserves here indicates; possibly as much as 80% of BNB's circulating supply is under Binance control either directly or indirectly through employee holdings One of the things that I'd be very concerned about if I were a BNB holder is how many more times BNB's $200 support can be tested before it finally gives way. BNB Weekly Chart (Investing.com) The problem for dip buyers down here is there is very little price discovery between $50 and $190. So if support in that area does give way, BNB could fall very far, very fast. Binance is apparently a deep-pocketed business, but the company has an 11-figure settlement it now has to worry about paying and a blockchain network that appears to be losing DAUs to Tron and other networks. Summary Once again, I'd fight any urge to buy BNB even after the settlement announcement. On the surface, Binance looks like it can handle these payments with its own reserves but we'll likely get a better sense for that in the months ahead. I think the broader takeaway from all of this for the crypto community is somewhat positive. We seemingly go through this every cycle. Crypto is an easy area to make a lot of money quickly and that attracts a certain type of character. In the last 12 months, we've seen Sam Bankman-Fried's fall from grace to a guilty verdict. It's somewhat fitting that a year later CZ now finds himself in the spotlight for the wrong reasons. In the last two years, this industry has endured Terra Luna (LUNC-USD), 3AC, FTX, Celsius/BlockFi/Voyager going under, miner bankruptcies, Genesis/Gemini, concerns about DCG, an antagonistic SEC, and now the largest exchange in the world settling with the DOJ. Yet Bitcoin is still above $36k. I think there's a signal there.

Through the partnership, KPMG will aim to provide advanced blockchain monitoring, support, governance and risk management for its clients so that firms can adhere to evolving crypto regulations and advance their anti-money laundering compliance programs, according to a statement on Wednesday. ""This collaboration will help to further solidify KPMG’s expertise in forensic investigations and cryptoassets and blockchain technology,” said Kunal Bhasin, partner and cryptoassets and blockchain co-leader at KPMG Canada.  The move comes as exploits and frauds in the digital asset sector have become more prominent and sophisticated. Globally, cryptocurrency-based illicit transaction volume hit an all-time high of $20.6 billion last year, according to the Chainalysis 2023 Crypto Crime Report. The sector has been plagued with sophisticated exploits such as wallet hacks and SIM swaps, with more recently, cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex losing about $114 million after hackers drained its hot wallets.  ""Layering KPMG’s extensive knowledge and experience in cryptoasset financial crimes over our platform’s industry-leading risk capabilities will help provide organizations with a more comprehensive approach to mitigating fraud risks in crypto transactions,” said Jonathan Levin, Chainalysis co-founder and chief strategy officer in the statement.  KPMG Canada has been active in the cryptocurrency sector for a while. Last year, it stepped into the metaverse by opening its first collaboration hub between its U.S. and Canadian units.

20541517,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561916,1700654411,Pro-XRP Lawyer Deaton Picks His Top 10 Cryptos For The Year Ahead,"In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), noted XRP advocate and lawyer John Deaton shared his top 10 cryptocurrency picks for the next 12 months. His selection includes a mix of well-established and emerging digital currencies. He stated, “If you had to pick only 10 tokens to own for the next 12 months (as a trade) what are they? Here’s mine: BTC, XRP, ETH, QNT, RNDR, SOL, KAS, AVAX, HBAR, CSPR. What am I missing?” Analysis Of The Pro-XRP Lawyer’s Picks Bitcoin (BTC): Deaton likely selected Bitcoin due to the potential imminent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts anticipate that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might approve multiple spot Bitcoin ETF by January 10, 2024, a move that could significantly impact Bitcoin’s value XRP: Deaton’s choice of XRP is consistent with his role as a strong supporter and legal advocate for the XRP community. XRP’s status as a regulatory-defined token in the United States with high utility adds to its appeal. Currently, XRP is consolidating after being rejected at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.7492. Ethereum (ETH): Despite the harsh criticism of Ethereum’s founder, Deaton has included ETH in his list. This might be due to its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Also, BlackRock and several other financial giants have recently applied for a Spot Ethereum ETF, adding to the potential bullish trajectory of ETH in the next 12 months. Related Reading: Did JPMorgan Secretly Buy 7.5 Million XRP? Here’s What We Know Quant (QNT): The QNT token of Quant Network has found itself in a downtrend channel since late January this year, down approximately 35% from its year-to-date high. With the current price of $98.74, QNT is 78% below its all-time high of $428.38 on November 21, 2023. Nevertheless, Quant can boast partnerships with major financial institutions, including the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), Bank of England, Bank of Canada, MasterCard, Amazon, and Barclays, to develop and test use cases for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Render Network (RNDR): The RDNR token is currently up 725% since the beginning of the year. Render Network provides a decentralized GPU rendering platform, allowing artists to scale GPU rendering work on-demand to high-performance GPU nodes. Notably, the RDNR price has also profited from the AI narrative. Solana: SOL has been one of the other big winners this year, up nearly 600% at the current price since it went below $8 at the end of last year. Solana is currently seen as the potential biggest challenger to Ethereum as a layer-1 blockchain, which is why Deaton may have ranked SOL on his list. Kaspa (KAS): Kaspa has gained attention due to its positioning as a highly scalable Layer-1 blockchain, with a focus on fast confirmations and high throughput. Its underlying technology, GhostDAG/PHANTOM protocol, aims to balance security, scalability, and decentralization. The KAS token’s impressive performance, with an over 2,600 % increase year-to-date, makes it a notable inclusion. Avalanche (AVAX): Avalanche’s AVAX token might be included due to its recent gains of almost 130% since mid-October. Deaton may have chosen AVAX because of Avalanche’s involvement in the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s tokenization initiative, Project Guardian, as well as its partnership with Amazon Web Services and Deloitte, all of which are potential catalysts for price appreciation. Related Reading: XRP Price: Cup And Handle Pattern Hints At Short-Term 208% Surge Hedera (HBAR): Hedera Hashgraph has gained prominence by becoming part of FedNow, the US Federal Reserve’s instant payments platform. This development led to a significant surge in the price of Hedera’s HBAR token. Casper (CSPR): Casper’s inclusion may be due to its position as one of the fastest-growing blockchain projects, with a focus on solving the blockchain trilemma of scalability, security, and decentralization. Remarkably, Deaton’s selections reflect a balance between established market leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and emerging, high-potential projects like Kaspa and Casper. This blend indicates a strategic approach to cryptocurrency investment, recognizing both stability and innovation within the digital asset space.

According to Santiment, the largest Ethereum wallets have been stacking up ETH at an alarming rate, suggesting that these large investors expect the price to keep going up. Ethereum Whales Buy $124 Billion Worth Of Tokens Santiment reports that the top 200 Ethereum whales have been buying ETH since November 21, 2022. This was just a few weeks after the FTX crypto exchange filed for bankruptcy, sending cryptocurrency prices across the space into a downward spiral. ETH prices would eventually fall as low as $900 and as fear grew, so did the opportunity for buying. Related Reading: Fetch AI Breakout Confirmed: Analysts Reveal Bullish Targets For FET Price However, even after prices began to recover once more, breaking above $1,000, these large investors did not reduce their buying. Santiment reveals that they continued to purchase tokens and by November 2022, these top 200 Ethereum wallets have bought up $124 billion worth of ETH. Source: Santiment on X In total, these addresses increased their holdings by a whopping 30%, and they now hold a collective 62.76 million tokens. This figure means that the top 200 Ethereum wallets now command approximately 52% of the total ETH supply. The whale buying spree has not been the only bullish development for Ethereum though as there has been a marked increase in the number of new ETH wallets that are being created. Santiment notes that on Tuesday, November 21, a total of 94,700 new wallets were created on the network, a new 4-month high. This could point to a return of interest in the ecosystem and adoption could trigger a price recovery. ETH On The Cusp Of Recovery Although the price of Ethereum has been hit hard following the news of Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao hitting the space hard, it has maintained a reasonable price level just below $2,000. This ensures that forecasts are still valid and the chances of recovery remain high. Related Reading: Solana Captures Institutional Investors’ Attention, Inflows Rise To $135 Million Crypto analyst FieryTrading has forecasted that the Ethereum price could cross back into the $2,350 territory soon. The analyst notes that the [rice had been on a continuous consolidation trend following the rise from $1,500 to $2,100. Given this, FieryTrading expects the altcoin to break out of its current ‘bull-flag’ as the market rallies. “Bull-flags are bullish continuation patterns, to bullish price action is the most likely result from this pattern,” FieryTrading explains. Once this breakout happens, then the analyst places the “Target at 2400$ for the coming weeks.” ETH is currently sitting at $1,996 at the time of this writing with small losses of 0.45% in the last 24 hours. It is performing better than Bitcoin which has fallen 2.24% in the same timeframe to trade at $36,480.

42409391,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcH9E3,1700649443,Trading Crypto on Binance Becomes Challenging as Order Book Liquidity Tanks 25%,"The loss of Binance's CEO and the leading digital assets exchange's $4 billion settlement of U.S. criminal charges on Tuesday failed to destabilize the wider crypto market in a big way. It has, however, impacted Binance's order book liquidity, complicating trading conditions for large traders.  Liquidity for top cryptocurrencies on the exchange, measured by 0.1% and 1% market depth indicators, has declined by 25% or more to less than $150 million and around $180 million, respectively, in the past 24 hours, data tracked by Kaiko show. Market depth is a collection of buy and sell orders within a certain percent of the mid-price, or the average of the bid and the ask prices.  In other words, moving the market by 0.1% and 1% in either direction is now 25% easier than it was 24 hours ago. It also means trading large orders on Binance at stable prices has become tougher, exposing so-called whales to slippage, that is movement between the price quoted when a trader places the order and what they actually pay when the order is filled.  As of now, it's still being determined whether the liquidity has moved to other exchanges.  On Tuesday, Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao stepped down as CEO and pleaded guilty as part of the U.S. settlement. Since then, users have withdrawn almost $1 billion in funds from the exchange.

Political criticism of an EU central bank digital currency includes conspiracy theories that it will be used as a means to strengthen state control.  Reservations about a potential digital euro – some of which have veered toward conspiracy theory territory – show there is no pressing need for one in the European Union, Bank of Spain Governor Pablo Hernández de Cos said during a Monday speech.  Although the European Central Bank's digital euro project is important, the European and Spanish payment systems are ""highly efficient,"" and so central bankers are ""pushing ahead with our analysis with the utmost caution,"" he said.  The ECB's central bank digital currency (CBDC) project, exploring the issuance of a digital version of the euro for retail payments, took off at great speed but slowed with legislative proposals earlier this year, and central bankers face political opposition. Criticism included legitimate concerns about privacy and spiraled into conspiracy theories about a digital euro playing a part in a plan to widen state control.  A CBDC should be designed to mitigate any risk to financial stability and monetary policy, Hernández de Cos said.  ""I am fully aware that, in its current state, this initiative raises many questions both for society in general and for the financial industry ... In these circumstances, issuing a digital euro is not naturally perceived to be a pressing need,"" he said.  That doesn't mean work on a digital euro should stop, the governor said. In November, the project entered a""preparation phase,"" during which the ECB will finalize a rulebook and select providers to develop a platform to run tests.  ""I believe it is our responsibility – not only the central bank's, but also the financial industry's – to be ready to ensure that a service which is key to society's well-being, as the payment system is, does not come under threat. Therefore, and irrespective of the decision which is ultimately made, I believe that all the Eurosystem's past and future efforts are fully warranted,"" Hernández de Cos said.

This admission was made as part of a substantial settlement, amounting to billions of dollars, reached between Zhao and regulatory authorities in the United States. Binance Coin had a decline of almost 6% following an earlier increase of up to 5% during the day. This fluctuation in value was driven by investors who were optimistic about the resolution of the ongoing multiyear investigation involving the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.

Binance will remain a “material entity in non-U.S. markets,” but Bernstein says it expects increased competition from the likes of listed rival Coinbase (COIN) and new exchanges in regulated markets such as Hong Kong and Singapore.  Bernstein says the crypto exchange has adequate funds to settle the $4.3 billion fine while maintaining healthy operations.  “Binance’s complete exit from the U.S would mean continued dominance of onshore and incumbent exchanges in the U.S.,” the authors wrote, noting that asset managers who have filed exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications are already working with exchanges such as Coinbase for prime broking and custody.  “In our view, this is the final straw before the establishment feels comfortable to approve a regulated bitcoin ETF,” they wrote.  Crypto services provider Matrixport says that while the plea deal does not include the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it is a very favorable outcome for Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao and the company itself, and the firm will likely remain a top-three exchange in the near term.  “With this plea deal, the expectations for a spot bitcoin ETF might have increased to 100% as the industry will be forced to follow the rules that TradFi firms must follow,” wrote Markus Thielen, head of research at Matrixport, referring to traditional finance.

20534484,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561887,1700640937,Spot Bitcoin ETF Odds ‘Might Have Increased To 100%’: Matrixport,"Matrixport, a leading digital finance platform, today, November 22, released a comprehensive research note focusing on the significant implications of yesterday’s developments in the crypto industry, particularly regarding the prospects of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States. Following the guilty plea of Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and the substantial financial settlements involved, Matrixport suggests that the path for approving a spot Bitcoin ETF might have become significantly clearer. The note highlights the regulatory crackdowns and compliance upgrades in the crypto sector, indicating a shift towards greater regulatory alignment with traditional financial (TradFi) systems. “Some would argue that the US agencies have cleaned up the industry this year by dismantling the US crypto-related banks, as two of them were running an internal ledger that crypto companies could use 24/7 to transfer fiat. Arguably, few (perceived) major actors are left, and with Bitcoin only declining -3.4% during the last 24 hours, the market is stomaching a major risk-off event,” Matrixport remarks. Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Odds At 100% Now? The company points out that with stringent enforcement actions and enhanced compliance programs becoming the norm among crypto exchanges, the differentiation between regulated and non-regulated cryptocurrency exchanges may become a key metric in 2024. This shift is seen as instrumental in the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US, a development long anticipated by the industry. Related Reading: Spot Bitcoin ETF Is ‘A Buy The News’ Event: Pantera Capital CEO “The result will likely be that more exchanges will enhance their compliance programs and become part of a surveillance-sharing agreement, which will be instrumental in approving a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US,” the firm stated, adding, “With this plea deal, the expectations for a spot Bitcoin ETF might have increased to 100% as the industry will be forced to follow the rules that TradFi firms must follow.” The firm believes that this “whitewashing” of the industry will not only enhance Bitcoin’s adoption by institutional players but also position it as a safe-haven asset in investment portfolios. “More importantly, this industry’s whitewashing will strengthen the Bitcoin adoption case for institutional players and will likely become a safe-haven asset in investors’ portfolios,” Matrixport predicts. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Hype: Bloomberg Intelligence Envisions $100 Billion Market With Regulatory Approval The note also touches on the anticipated sale of the FTX exchange and its potential relaunch under a US securities law-compliant management team by Q3 2024. Matrixport speculates that this could lead to significant inflows, estimated between $24-50 billion, into any US-listed Bitcoin ETF. They also note the increasing trend of crypto firms making markets on CME-listed crypto derivatives, indicating a shift from retail-focused, unregulated exchanges to those that are fully regulated and cater to institutional clients. ‘Dark Cloud Has Been Removed’ As ETF Makes Progress Analysts and industry experts have echoed Matrixport’s sentiments. Will Clemente, a noted analyst, stated, “With resolution on Binance, just a matter of weeks until Bitcoin ETF approval now.” Tony “The Bull” Severino, head of research at NewsBTC, commented, “A dark cloud has just been removed from the crypto market.” Conversely, Scott Johnsson, a finance lawyer at Davis Polk, offered a more cautious view, suggesting that “It’s far more likely an ETF decision led the Binance resolution than the other way around imo. And I’m not convinced either is that likely.” Remarkably, there has been some movement in the spot ETF approval process in the last few days. Ark Invest has kicked off the third round of amendments to the S-1 filings, Grayscale had a meeting with the US Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday regarding its “uplisting.” At press time, BTC traded at $36,483.

The exchange successfully processed nearly $1 billion in withdrawals in the last 24 hours, quelling fears of an FTX-style bank run.  Crypto exchange Binance saw over $950 million in net outflows over the past 24 hours as it was hit with criminal charges in the U.S., and founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao agreed to step down as chief executive officer as part of a record settlement.  “There are constant hourly net outflows of bitcoin and stablecoins after the CZ's resignation announcement,” Hochan Chung, head of marketing at CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk. “However, compared to the total reserves of Binance, the current volume is not yet significant at all.”  Binance is set to continue operating as usual and make a ""complete exit"" from the U.S market.  The withdrawals are fairly above average, but not usually large on a weekly basis, an analysis of net hourly flows from the on-chain data tool CryptoQuant shows.  Data from a Dune Analytics dashboard shows over $2.37 billion in various tokens left the exchange, but some $1.78 billion in tokens were deposited.  Address “0x43feD72B921aF413Aad831CEbd221697B18DA54F,” apparently connected to the institutional trading desk FalconX, withdrew the most at $83 million. Another address “0xeae7380dd4cef6fbd1144f49e4d1e6964258a4f4,” with apparent links to market maker Wintermute Trading, led deposits at $190 million.  Binance's BNB tokens were the most deposited and withdrawn tokens, the data shows.  As such, the processing of withdrawals and deposits helps buffer any concerns about the exchange’s solvency. The situation is far unlike last year’s run on embattled exchange FTX, which stopped customer withdrawals following a CoinDesk story that revealed Sam Bankman-Fried's company commingled customer assets with those of its trading arm, Alameda Research.

It alleges that Gemini made preferential transfers of an ""aggregate gross amount of no less than approximately $689,302,000"" from Genesis at the expense of other creditors and asked the court to ""correct this unfairness.""  Genesis and Gemini have been embroiled in a public and legal feud ever since the collapse of FTX. Genesis filed for bankruptcy in January. Its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), was sued by Gemini in July over allegations that DCG then described as ""defamatory"" and a ""publicity stunt."" In September, Genesis sued its parent company, DCG, seeking the repayment of multiple loans worth over $600 million. And then, in October, Gemini sued Genesis over 60 million shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), valued at around $1.6 billion. Gemini's co-founders are the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron.  The saga has seen legal action from U.S. authorities, too. In January, days before Genesis filed for bankruptcy, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged Genesis and Gemini sold unregistered securities. Last month, New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against DCG, Genesis and Gemini for allegedly defrauding more than 230,000 investors, including at least 29,000 New Yorkers, of more than $1 billion.  The filing alleges that as market turmoil caused by the collapse of Terraform Labs and digital asset hedge fund Three Arrows Capital unfolded, Gemini made ""unprecedented withdrawals"" before the bankruptcy filing, contributing to a ""run on the bank."" During a 90-day period known as the preference period, Gemini demanded repayment of prior loans made to Genesis. These transfers were ""avoidable"" and upon ""information and belief"" that Genesis was ""insolvent.""  Gemini tweeted that Genesis has ""asserted several baseless and inflammatory counterclaims"" and that it would continue to pursue the legal process.

But that's certainly different from how traders look at the events.  According to over-the-counter institutional cryptocurrency trading network Paradigm, the options market has increased activity in topside bitcoin call options in the aftermath of the Binance news, a sign of persistent bullish sentiment.  ""In the options space, after the initial two-way flow, we have seen interest in loading up more topside with strong demand for the March 2024 expiry [calls],"" Patrick Chu, head of institutional sales coverage at Paradigm, told CoinDesk.  Data shared by market analyst Chang shows that early Wednesday, market participants traded 550 contracts of BTC $45,000 strike call option expiring in March 2024 on Deribit. Buyers, expecting a continued price rally in bitcoin in the coming months, paid a cumulative premium of $1.5 million for the bullish bets. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC.  A call option is a contract between a buyer and a seller to purchase the underlying asset at a preset price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, while a put buyer is bearish.  Overall, both short-term and long-term calls continue to trade at a premium relative to puts, as evidenced by the positive call-put skews. It's a sign the market doesn't expect a significant fallout from Binance's guilty plea.  The sentiment is that U.S. regulators have cleaned up the industry, setting the stage for approving the first U.S.-based exchange-traded fund that invests in cryptocurrency. The so-called spot-based ETF is expected to bring billions in investor money to the crypto market.

42409396,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcH9Kf,1700633836,Sam Altman to Return as OpenAI CEO Following In-Principle Agreement,"Sam Altman, the founder of artificial intelligence startup OpenAI, was ousted from the company last week, prompting backlash from employees and shareholders.  An in-principle agreement could bring him back as CEO, the company said on Wednesday.  OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman is set to return as the chief executive officer of the artificial intelligence startup nearly a week after he was ousted from the company's board, prompting backlash from employees and key stakeholders.  ""We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board of Bret Taylor (Chair), Larry Summers, and Adam D'Angelo,"" OpenAI said in an X post on Wednesday morning.  ""I’m looking forward to returning to openai, and building on our strong partnership with msft (Microsoft),"" Altman said in a post early Wednesday.  Altman was forced out of his role last weekend because he ""was not consistently candid in his communications"" with the board. A leaked memo was not specific about why Altman was forced to depart from the company, which said the firing ""was not made in response to malfeasance or anything related to our financial, business, safety, or security/privacy practices.""  But OpenAI’s loss was someone else’s gain. Earlier this week, reports emerged that Altman, Greg Brockman, the company's co-founder and president, and other former staff members would be joining software giant Microsoft, one of the key investors in the AI startup.  OpenAI's major investors, led by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, reportedly pushed to reinstate Altman as CEO and replace the current board following the unexpected firing, with intense negotiations involved in the process.  Altman’s departure even sparked criticism from hundreds of OpenAI employees – even prompting a note to the board threatening to leave the company to join Altman unless the board formally resigned.  Blockchain betters cash out  Prediction market traders on Polymarket have been enthusiastically betting on this Macbethian corporate saga, with some winning over $10,000.  According to on-chain data, Xinako, who describes themselves as a China-based crypto and NFT investor on X, currently has a position worth $44,777 to the ""Yes"" side of the ""Sam Back as CEO of OpenAI"" contract.  Their position is up 50%, as they bought in at an average of 65 cents, adding $14,956, to their book value.  Another user called Berkeleyverse has seen their position increase by 114%, buying in at 46 cents, bringing their book value to $10,703.  On the flip side, a user going by the name of Ilya Sutskever (a reference to OpenAI's chief scientist who reportedly had a poor relationship with Altman) holds the largest no position currently worth $616. This user has lost 94% of the book value of the bet, or $10,000.  In total, over $275,000 was bet on the contract, with another $40,000 bet on if Shear would be CEO of OpenAI by the end of the week.  Even though both Altman, OpenAI, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella have announced Altman's return to the company, the Polymarket contract currently isn't resolved — meaning bets aren't finalized — because there has yet to be a resolution posted to UMA, the oracle that resolves prediction market contracts like this.  During the hunt for the Titan submarine, which ended up imploding and killing its passengers, the UMA oracle was in the spotlight because of a debate on if the submarine had been found, focused on the semantics of the word.  The issue of whether the submarine was found was sent to UMA, and put to a vote with hopes the decentralized dispute resolver would find the truth in the word's meaning.  UMA's ruling in favor of the ""yes"" bettors sparked further debate, highlighting concerns about its voting process being controlled by a few token holders and questioning the fairness and decentralization of such systems in crypto, DLNews reported.

Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader's initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  Such data is beneficial for traders as it serves as a signal of leverage being effectively washed out from popular futures products – acting as a short-term indication of a decline in price volatility.  Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, was criminally charged with breaking sanctions and money-transmitting laws and agreed to pay $4.3 billion to settle the allegations in ""one of the largest penalties"" the U.S. has ever obtained from a corporate defendant.

BNB changed hands at $234, recovering from the overnight low of $223, CoinDesk data show. Both currencies, however, were still down 3.3% and 11.5% on a 24-hour basis, nursing hangover from Tuesday's events, which saw Binance agree to a $4.3 billion settlement for violating sanctions and money-transmitting laws. Binance's founder CZ pleaded guilty and stepped down as CEO in what's called one of the largest corporate penalties ever, CoinDesk previously reported.  Binance illegally relied on U.S. customers as a significant source of revenue and trading activity, recently unsealed documents show, with the criminal complaint revealing years of compliance failures and deliberate obfuscation to protect these crucial yet off-limits users. CZ's lawyers said that his sentencing will be delayed by 6 months and he has agreed to waive his right to appeal if the sentence does not exceed 18 months.  Some traders believe CZ's downfall may be a blessing in disguise, boosting the probability of the U.S. SEC approving one or more spot bitcoin ETFs in the coming months.  ""With this plea deal, the expectations for a spot Bitcoin ETF might have increased to 100% as the industry will be forced to follow the rules that TradFi firms must follow. More importantly, this industry's whitewashing will strengthen the Bitcoin adoption case for institutional players and will likely become a safe-haven asset in investors’ portfolios,"" crypto services provider Matrixport said in a Telegram message.  Still, the price volatility spurred by the action against Binance and CZ looks to have proved costly for leverage traders. Data from Coinglass shows that in the 12 hours since the settlement was announced, $110 million in bitcoin long positions were liquidated compared to $37.2 million in short positions. In the last hour, that number has reversed with $4.26 million in short positions being liquidated compared to $111,000 in longs.  BNB, which doesn't trade as actively as bitcoin because most users stake it, saw $3.73 million in long positions liquidated compared to $1.61 million in short positions, according to Coinglass. Data shows that options volume for BNB has surged by 68% to $2.41 million, while options open interest has surged 29% to $3.47 million.

Binance CEO To Plead Guilty The Wall Street Journal has disclosed that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), commonly known as CZ, will plead guilty to violating criminal anti-money laundering requirements. Concurrently, Binance will also plead guilty to a criminal charge related to anti-money laundering violations, resulting in a significant fine. Furthermore, CZ is expected to step down as CEO, with Richard Teng being considered as a potential successor. Changpeng Zhao is scheduled to appear before a federal court in Seattle to enter his guilty plea. This crucial legal step can further impact BNB’s price action as investors assess the implications of CZ’s admission of guilt regarding violating anti-money laundering requirements. Related Reading: Analyst Sets $30,000 Floor For Bitcoin, But Can We Forget 2021’s Misfire? The reported settlement involves Binance pleading guilty to a criminal charge related to anti-money laundering violations, leading to a hefty $4.3 billion fine. This substantial sum encompasses payments to settle civil allegations made by regulators. These developments occur in an increasingly stringent regulatory environment in the cryptocurrency industry. The recent charges brought by the SEC against Kraken further highlight the regulatory scrutiny faced by industry players. Additionally, market participants anticipate significant enforcement actions by the DOJ, which adds to the atmosphere of uncertainty and apprehension. Will CZ’s Statement Halt BNB Downtrend? Despite the shocking revelation surrounding Binance’s leadership and its impact on the crypto community, there may still be hopes for a potential recovery of Binance Coin and the overall crypto market as the case reaches its conclusion. With CZ reaching a settlement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and pleading guilty to criminal charges, the exchange can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that regulatory agencies have addressed their concerns and potential legal action. Related Reading: From Cool-Off To Takeoff: How XRP’s Current Value Signals An Imminent Market Triumph Furthermore, this settlement could be seen as a victory for regulators, particularly in light of the ongoing legal battles between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs, which involve the cryptocurrency XRP. A favorable outcome in these cases could potentially boost confidence in the broader crypto industry and drive prices higher. Currently, BNB is trading at $240, showing signs of recovery from its recent drop, which briefly touched $235 but managed to stay above the critical support level of $232. In further declines, BNB bulls will need to hold the support levels at $228, $217, and $214 to prevent the token from dropping below the critical level of $200. However, suppose Changpeng Zhao and the new Binance CEO can provide a statement that reassures the community and instills a sense of calm. In that case, it may bring a renewed positive sentiment and potentially halt the current downtrend for BNB. The unfolding of the situation, the next steps for the exchange, and CZ’s fate remain to be seen. The community and market participants eagerly await further developments and announcements shaping the future of Binance and its native token, BNB.

42409381,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcH8kI,1700617370,Is Binance Big Enough to Survive a $4.3B Fine and Founder CZ’s Ousting?,"In August, before it was fully clear the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) would bring charges against Binance, news leaked that the federal prosecutors building the case were worried an indictment could cause customers to panic and withdraw their funds en masse, potentially creating panic in the crypto markets, wider industry contagion or even a liquidity shortfall.  On Tuesday, the DOJ reached a “historic” settlement with the world’s largest exchange. The stated crimes are sweeping, and the penalty is massive. Binance will pay a $4.3 billion fine for violating money transmission laws and U.S. sanctions, and its CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, who founded the firm in 2017 and built it into a behemoth, was forced to resign.  Withdrawals over the past day have ticked up to $566.8 million, according to DefiLlama’s centralized exchange dashboard.  Customers rushing to yank their money out of FTX ruined that exchange because its operators fraudulently embezzled the money. On the other hand, at this point, Binance appears to be sound. Its latest “proof of reserves” report, an imperfect but voluntary attestation of an exchange’s holdings, shows the exchange holds $65 billion worth of crypto assets alone. DefiLlama counts it at $68.4 billion.  Further, Binance appears to be overcollateralized for many of the largest assets on its books, like bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), tether (USDT) and others, meaning Binance’s net balances are more than it owes customers. In other words, if every Binance customer withdrew every bitcoin they owned, the exchange would have bitcoins to spare.  The loss of Zhao will be felt. He was not the firm’s figurehead, but its leader. He communicated to his fans, supporters and users in figurative language – often being able to blow off bad news with a tweet. Many times this year, when the bad news kept coming, he’d tweet out a single number: “4.” That stood for his four principles, to ignore the “FUD” — or fear, uncertainty and doubt” — and remain positive.  See also Binance Needs to Get Off Twitter | Opinion  “Admittedly, it was not easy to let go emotionally. But I know it is the right thing to do. I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself,” Zhao wrote Tuesday on X/Twitter.  If these inconveniences affect customer experiences, it may be the only thing capable of killing the exchange  Zhao is personally on the hook for $200 million in civil and criminal penalties, which for an early crypto adopter whose net worth ranges from $17 million on the low end deca-billions is a small price to pay to settle charges from a coordinated investigation involving the DOJ, CFTC and two enforcement departments under the Treasury Departments, FinCEN and OFAC.  Binance, no stranger to regulatory action, appears to have had a contingency plan in the works for a while, and reacted quickly to its decapitation. Binance’s head of regional markets, Richard Teng, who was hired in 2021 and was a rumored CZ successor, will step up as CEO. This quick promotion, which was already in the public consciousness, has done a lot to stymie disorder – especially considering Zhao might spend the next 18 months to 10 years in a U.S. federal prison.  While Yi He, Zhao’s co-founder, rumored romantic partner and “chief customer service officer” (a self-defined role that encapsulates the firm’s “business, marketing and branding strategy,” according to her company bio), appears to be staying on. Although Zhao won’t be allowed any involvement with Binance for at least three years, according to the government’s terms, He could potentially act as an informal conduit between the company and its largest shareholder, Zhao.  In many ways, Binance got off easy. It has to pay a massive penalty, yes, but it looks like it has money on the books to survive. Binance will also need to appoint an independent monitor and send compliance reports to the U.S. government. ConsenSys senior counsel and director of global regulatory matters Bill Hughes said this will be a huge boon to U.S. criminal investigators:  “All Binance transaction records that exist today, which may very well go back to the beginning of the exchange, are there for the taking by law enforcement. They will show how illicit payments flowed through the exchange. Law enforcement will have full access to an ocean of intelligence about illicit flows inside the blackbox of that exchange to match against the immutable record of transactions you find on-chain.”  Perhaps Binance will never end up in regulatory good graces, but paying restitution, coming into compliance and ending a multi-year criminal investigation that held like a sword of Damocles over the exchange could allow it to turn a new leaf. (And Zhao, who has essentially lived an itinerant lifestyle since his exchange was kicked out of China the same year it was founded, 2017, can finally take a breath.)  See also: Binance Got Huge Due to U.S. Customers. That Was Illegal, U.S. Says  Perhaps now the European countries including France, the Netherlands and even the tax shelter Cyprus, which either declined granting Binance a license to operate or opened up their own regulatory investigations, will give the exchange a second chance. Binance, at the same time it was required to pull out of several jurisdictions, has in some ways grown over the past year while the rest of the industry retracted.  Binance could be said to be the one of the few firms that benefited from the collapse of rival FTX, absorbing a global crypto-trading customer base. In his first public announcement as CEO, Teng said the exchange boasts over 150 million users, and thousands of employees. The exchange also runs divisions in nearly every crypto vertical, maintains one of the most used DeFi chains and made moves into AI.  Nothing is total insurance, but the exchange still has momentum. It also has other roadblocks ahead, including a civil lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging a number of financial violations. The company has also been hemorrhaging executives, and in July after a round of layoffs it was reported the exchange could ultimately cull a third of its global workforce.  In October, the company's U.S. division, Binance.US, modified its terms of use, making it so users can no longer withdraw dollars directly from the platform — except through stablecoins. That same month, Binance onboarded ""a number of new regulated and authorized fiat partners"" to enable users to deposit and withdraw euros, after its former partner Paysafe halted services for the exchange.  If these inconveniences affect customer experiences, it may be the only thing capable of killing the exchange. Binance, in some sense, was beloved because it embodied the cowboy, outlaw mentality of crypto. It’s unclear what sort of psychological affect the denouement of the DOJ’s investigation, the unprecedented fine or the possible imprisonment of the exchange’s former CEO will have on such an audience.  See also: Binance's CZ and the End of the 'Borderless' Crypto Company | Opinion  It’s also unclear whether the magnitude of the exchange’s crimes will taint its reputation, even among the staunchest crypto-anarchists. “The Binance platform was facilitating some truly horrible stuff – everything from terrorist financing to ransomware actions, child pornography and various scams and frauds,” a senior Treasury official told reporters.  Binance, to its credit, has copped to its mistakes. The official company statement repeated what it has said before, that the company “grew at an extremely fast pace” and “made misguided decisions along the way.”  For almost its entire existence – barring the last couple of months, when Binance’s PR and legal teams seemed to make a show of the exchange prioritizing compliance – the exchange acted with extreme disregard to U.S. and global regulations. Zhao once boasted the exchange had no headquarters because Bitcoin doesn’t. It opened and closed subsidiaries in known tax havens like Bermuda (in 2018, planning to develop a regulatory framework that didn’t pan out), Jersey (shuttered in 2020) and Malta (ousted in 2021).  “Today, Binance takes responsibility for this past chapter,” the company’s statement continued. Perhaps its the only thing it can say, to remain a going concern. Many questions remain: will a compliant Binance be able to grow?  Will Binance finally find a home? And if so, will it then lose its place in its customer’s hearts?

42409404,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcH9eV,1700616600,"Binance's Busy Day, Kraken's Second SEC Fight","Binance is paying one of the largest fines in corporate history to the U.S. Department of Justice, while its founder and CEO, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, stepped down from his role running the platform as part of a settlement with multiple federal agencies. Meanwhile, Kraken is facing a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that echoes the SEC's previous wave of suits.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  CZ out, $4.3B in  The narrative  Binance settled charges with multiple U.S. agencies (with one major exception), ending one of the most highly anticipated regulatory actions in crypto.  Why it matters  Binance is the world's largest crypto exchange by volume, and just agreed to pay what federal officials are describing as some of the nation's largest fines.  Breaking it down  Binance and Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao settled with multiple federal agencies on Tuesday, agreeing to pay billions of dollars in a deal that will also see Zhao face potential prison time, Binance make a ""complete exit"" from the U.S. and agree to strict oversight from monitors over the next several years.  If you missed Tuesday's regulatory extravaganza:  Binance and the Department of Justice settled charges that Binance conspired to conduct an unlicensed money transmitting business where it failed to have an anti-money laundering program. Binance will pay a $1.8 billion fine and $2.5 billion in forfeitures, as well as appoint a monitor for three years to ensure its compliance with federal law moving forward.  Zhao and the Department of Justice settled charges that the now-former exchange CEO violated the Bank Secrecy Act and tried to have a financial institution violate the Bank Secrecy Act. Zhao agreed to pay $50 million (credited against a Commodity Futures Trading Commission fine) but his sentencing isn't for another few months.  Binance and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission settled the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) March 2023 suit alleging it operated an unlicensed crypto derivatives trading platform in the U.S. and went out of its way to hide it from U.S. regulators. Binance will pay $1.35 billion in civil penalties and another $1.35 billion in disgorgement.  Zhao and the CFTC settled, in which Zhao will pay $150 million to the agency.  Former Binance Chief Compliance Officer Samuel Lim settled charges with the CFTC, in which Lim will pay $1.5 million to the agency.  Binance and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) settled charges that it violated anti-money laundering and sanctions laws. Binance will pay $3.4 billion in penalties and appoint a monitor for five years to ensure it's both complying with federal regulations and exiting the U.S. entirely (Binance.US is not affected by this).  Binance and the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) settled charges that it violated anti-money laundering and sanctions laws. Binance will pay $968 million.  If you noticed the numbers don’t add up, you’re right. It’s a confusing mess, largely because the amounts overlap with each other and involve some financial punishments that are put off unless the company strays again. An actual total of $4.3 billion will move from Binance to U.S. government coffers, officials said. FinCEN is collecting $780 million. Another $150 million is a suspended penalty, while $2.47 billion will be credited to the DOJ and CFTC. OFAC will collect another $70 million and credit another $898 million to the DOJ. CoinDesk's Jesse Hamilton checked and the CFTC is for sure getting the $1.35 million fine.  So in total:  DOJ is getting $2.018 billion from Binance.  FinCEN is getting $780 million from Binance.  OFAC is getting $70 million from Binance.  CFTC is getting $1.35 billion from Binance, $150 million from Zhao and $1.5 million from Lim.  $150 million is a suspended penalty.  ""One of the things that [Treasury] works hard in collaboration with the Justice Department on is that a substantial amount of this penalty will go to the victims of state-sponsored terrorism in a fund that supports payments to those families and individuals,"" a senior Treasury official said.  Binance's role as a major crypto exchange that operated secretively within the U.S. is maybe the bigger story. The exchange targeted ""VIP users"" in the U.S. to drive its growth in the early days, court filings said. Zhao knew about this, and knew that somewhere around one third of his platform's users were from the U.S., and spent time figuring out how to conceal that these users were on the platform instead of removing them.  Moreover, the exchange had a lot of users from sanctioned locations, the DOJ alleged, citing Binance's discovery of ""600 'verified level 2' users from Iran"" in November 2019 as just one example. Nearly $1 billion in trades between U.S. users and users in sanctioned nations occurred on Binance's platform.  Many of the allegations are repeats or tied to what we saw in the CFTC lawsuit from March – that the exchange knowingly and deliberately allowed U.S. persons to trade on its platform without conducting know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks, and without registering properly. The exchange allowed U.S. customers to trade against customers from sanctioned nations, which is pretty obviously illegal.  ""The Justice Department is also imposing a monitorship, as well as reporting requirements on Binance as part of today's resolution,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said. ""Moving forward, Binance must file the suspicious activity reports that were required by law. The company is required to review past transactions and report suspicious activity to federal authorities. This will advance our criminal investigations into malicious cyber activity and terrorism fundraising, including the use of cryptocurrency exchanges to support groups such as Hamas.""  The DOJ monitor will be in place for three years. FinCEN is also appointing a monitor who will be in place for five years, and who will be granted access to all of Binance's books and records.  This seems to go well beyond just U.S. users, and I imagine there are regulators around the world who may be interested in what exactly the U.S. finds in those past transactions.  There was one notable absence on Tuesday: Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler was not among the federal officials announcing settlements with the exchange.  There's an easy answer to why this may have been the case: The SEC is likely looking for court wins it can point to as part of its ongoing effort to treat crypto exchanges similarly to U.S. stock exchange systems. The other agencies secured wins and massive penalties, but most of those allegations were basically the same: Binance offered U.S. people access to products and services without following the law.  We'll get into this more below, but the SEC is currently on a mission to have crypto trading platforms divide up their exchange, clearinghouse and broker/dealer functions, like how stock trading works. Binance (and more Binance.US than Binance.com) is one of those companies that doesn't treat these functions differently.  For more on Tuesday's actions, read our coverage.

Tether Freezes $225M Linked to Human Trafficking Syndicate Amid DOJ Investigation: Tether says it froze $225 million worth of its USDT stablecoin tied to ""pig butchering"" scams – i.e. human trafficking groups – in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Justice.  Kraken and SEC round 2  On first blush, this suit sounds really familiar.  Many of the arguments tread familiar ground. Kraken is operating an unregistered securities broker, clearinghouse and exchange, the regulator alleged, offering the U.S. investing public access to similarly unregistered securities without making full disclosures to that public. We've seen this a few times before. The SEC has secured two settlements (which aren't nothing, legal precedent-wise, but which also aren't really a whole lot) and sued a few other exchanges which are currently fighting.  ""Without registering with the SEC in any capacity, Kraken has simultaneously acted as a broker, dealer, exchange, and clearing agency with respect to these crypto asset securities. In doing so, Kraken has created risk for investors and taken in billions of dollars in fees and trading revenue from investors without adhering to or even recognizing the requirements of the U.S. securities laws that are designed to protect investors,"" the suit alleged.  Unlike the Coinbase lawsuit, but similarly to the Binance and Binance.US suit, the SEC is alleging commingling of customer and corporate funds, as well as poor controls and recordkeeping – things ""that would also be prohibited at any properly registered securities intermediary,"" per the filing.  In a blog post, Kraken made the argument that the SEC hadn't alleged any customer funds were lost or that any customers were harmed. This is a similar argument to what Binance argued in its early defenses to the SEC lawsuit against it.  It's unclear how much this will actually matter though. As Judge Lewis Kaplan said during Sam Bankman-Fried's criminal trial, the issue isn't whether customers can or will be made whole, it's that the funds were taken in the first place.  ""The crime charged is that [Bankman-Fried] took the money … what he did with it afterward doesn't matter,"" he said last month.  On the other hand, Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who's overseeing the Binance case, was visibly frustrated when she was unable to get a clear answer to the question of whether Binance had moved customer assets overseas.  There's some important differences – Jackson was in a hearing where the SEC sought a temporary restraining order, civil versus criminal, etc. – but if this case does proceed to a trial, it is an important distinction that's likely to come up.  The other interesting detail from Monday's Kraken suit, which CoinDesk's Danny Nelson pointed out, is the SEC detailed how Kraken, specifically, promoted the various cryptocurrencies the regulator alleges are unregistered securities.  In previous suits, the SEC detailed how it believed different cryptocurrencies, like the FIL token associated with the Filecoin network, may be securities. But the suits usually ended those analyses with the focus on the tokens' issuers.  Tuesday's suit referred to ""public statements made by Kraken"" as the platform listing these digital assets and making them available to the investing public, where the exchange ""reinforced investors' reasonable expectation of profits,"" if they invested in the tokens.  Pretty important details, if you're trying to suggest the exchange deliberately violated federal securities laws.  This week  This week  It looks like there's no scheduled events in the crypto regulatory world? There was a bankruptcy hearing for Genesis on Monday but that was postponed (new date TBD). There was a press conference on Tuesday but I postponed this newsletter for the Binance stuff. Thursday is the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S. It's followed by Black Friday, when the Americans thankful for everything they have immediately go get more stuff. If you need me, I'll be in Best Buy.  Elsewhere:  (The Wall Street Journal) Crypto exchange Bullish, an independent subsidiary of Block.one, has acquired CoinDesk from Digital Currency Group. You can also read the press release from Bullish here.  (Wired) Wired's Andy Greenberg spoke to the individuals behind the Mirai botnet, which functionally took down parts of the internet back in 2016 (if you want to get technical, really what it did was overwhelm the servers at a domain name service provider, which blocked people from reaching the sites they wanted to reach).  (DataBreaches) New threat vector just dropped: A ransomware group breached a publicly traded company's systems, stole some files and then reported the company to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for not disclosing the breach (SEC rules mandating this kind of disclosure aren't actually in effect yet).  (The Information) OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman was fired last Friday and it was pretty chaotic. As of Tuesday, we still haven't actually heard why.

Zhao pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act in court earlier on Tuesday, after federal officials alleged he directed Binance to allow U.S. customers to use the platform without conducting proper know-your-customer or anti-money laundering checks.  Read more: Binance to Pay $4.3B to Settle U.S. Criminal Case; Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao Resigns as CEO and Pleads Guilty in Seattle  According to a court filing, he's posting $15 million held in a trust account by Davis Wright Tremaine (separate from the bond) and agreeing to forfeit funds if he violates the terms of his release. He's also finding two guarantors, who are pledging $250,000 and $100,000 respectively. A sentencing hearing has been scheduled for Feb. 23, 2024, at 9 a.m. Pacific Time.  The terms of Zhao's release bar him from breaking the law, tempering with witnesses or victims or taking any non-prescribed controlled substances – normal provisions in a bond release.  The order also appears to allow Zhao to leave the U.S., saying he has to return 14 days prior to sentencing, though federal prosecutors said during a hearing earlier on Tuesday that they wanted to appeal that provision to a more senior judge.  Zhao agreed to remain in the Seattle area until Monday, Nov. 27, allowing DOJ lawyers and his attorneys to hash out that disagreement with the district judge overseeing the case.  Because Zhao pleaded guilty pursuant to an agreement, he waived his right to appeal any sentence over 18 months, Magistrate Judge Brian Tsuchida said in court Tuesday. According to another court filing, the DOJ and Zhao agreed to a $50 million fine, but no prison time was mentioned.  Zhao resigned from Binance, the exchange he founded in 2017, as part of the company's settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday. Binance will pay $4.3 billion in penalties to various federal agencies and allow multiple monitors to oversee its operations through the next five years.

20519297,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561823,1700611212,"DeFi gathering momentum, Ethereum Gas Fees Rising: Why Is Uniswap (UNI) Stuck?","Decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on Ethereum is picking up momentum based mainly on how gas fees have been trending in the first three weeks of November, data from Kaiko shows. Even so, despite Uniswap (UNI) spearheading the revival, looking at the gas attributed to its activities over this period, UNI prices remain stagnant below $5.6, with bulls failing to edge higher, breaking to new 2023 highs. Ethereum Gas Fees Rising, DeFi Revival? According to Kaiko, a blockchain analytics platform, the average gas fees on Ethereum hit multi-month highs last week. The platform expressly notes that the primary driver has been Uniswap’s activities, reading from the rising transaction volumes from meme coins, including GROK. This, in turn, pushed block space demand higher, increasing gas fees. Related Reading: Global Banks Are Betting Big On XRP, Report Shows Gas fees remain volatile but generally higher in the first three weeks of November. As of November 20, Ycharts data shows that the average cost of sending a transaction stood at 45.13 Gwei, nearly 100% from November 19, when it was at 24.84 Gwei. This is a significant jump from 17.66 Gwei in late October 2023. Gas fees and how ETH and DeFi token prices react are directly correlated as DeFi and other on-chain activities like non-fungible token (NFT) minting and trading rise; gas fees usually expand in trending markets. Accordingly, the recent expansion in gas fees could suggest that the markets could be preparing for a leg up, and tokens of critical protocols, including Uniswap or Aave, could benefit. DeFi TVL Rising, But Uniswap Is Stuck Below $5.6 As of writing, the total value locked (TVL) across all DeFi protocols stands at over $46.6 billion as of November 21, according to DeFiLlama. This increase is nearly $5 billion more than in early November and up from $37 billion in mid-October. Ethereum remains a choice platform for deploying DeFi apps despite the relatively gas fees pinned to mainnet scaling challenges. The pioneer smart contract blockchain manages $25.4 billion in TVL, whereas Uniswap is one of the largest protocols with $3.216 billion in TVL. UNI prices are up 30% from mid-October when writing on November 21. However, bulls have been unable to break above the November highs at around $5.6. From the daily chart, trading volume, and thus participation, has been tapering even though prices have been edging higher.

Technically, there could be more gains if there is a solid close above November highs with expanding volumes. In that case, UNI could expand, retesting 2023 highs of around $7.2.
