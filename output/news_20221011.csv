Even popular tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum do not give investors any hope. This is evident from their current prices of $19,005 and $1,282, respectively, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Multiple factors are backing up the present state of the crypto market. One is the Fed&apos;s quantitative tightening in the Q2 of 2022. While investors have that to contend with, the negative Consumer Price Index (CPI) value released in September has also affected the market.

This is particularly true considering the anticipated Consumer Price Index to be released on Thursday. But while the crypto maintains a bearish movement, some tokens appear to stand out in the crowd. A perfect example of picking out is XRP. This digital token seems to have resistance to the ongoing trend of the market. XRP Stands Out Amid Bearish Market The current price of XRP, as per data from TradingView, is $0.4875.

The exploit was initially reported on Twitter by blockchain auditors OtterSec, who say “the attacker was able to manipulate their Mango collateral.”  “The [MGNO] governance token was valued for far more than it should be,” OtterSec’s Robert Chen told CoinDesk. “With that, [the attacker] was able to take out large loans against it and then drain Mango's [liquidity] pools. It's like a lending-borrowing race: If you have overvalued collateral, you can then borrow against that collateral, and that's what they did.”  According to Chen, it remains unclear how, exactly, the attacker managed to inflate MNGO’s value in the eyes of the Mango protocol, though there are already several theories floating around on Twitter suggesting how the heist could’ve been pulled off.

The drained funds remained, at press time, on the Solana blockchain. In similar cases, centralized exchanges like Coinbase, Binance and Kraken – the only entities with enough liquidity for someone to cash out amounts this large – have blacklisted offending addresses.  In its initial statement, Mango said it was ""taking steps to have third parties freeze funds in flight"" and ""disabling deposits on the front end as a precaution.""

42422201,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0ienh,1665528118,DappRadar Says It’s Recalculating Decentraland User Data,"Blockchain data provider DappRadar published a blog post on Tuesday outlining how it calculates its data for the number of “active"" users interacting with decentralized applications (dapps), including metaverse platform Decentraland.  DappRadar said that it tracks the number of Unique Active Wallets (UAW), the number of transactions and the volume of those transactions across different dapps. It does this by tracking “unchangeable decentralized application data from the blockchain, providing verifiable insights for all its users.”  For example, when tracking the number of transactions to or from a smart contract, that data point is tracked live on the blockchain.  “It’s important to note that data on the blockchain is unchangeable, and therefore it doesn’t lie,” the post said. “However, this data doesn’t always mean the same for each dapp. Furthermore, blockchain data doesn’t always paint the entire picture.”  It went on to explain that a standard measurement it uses for its DappRadar Rankings is “Unique Active Wallets,” which shows the dapps with the “most user wallets interacting with it.”  “The DappRadar tooltip describes the UAW or user data as the ‘number of unique wallet addresses interacting with a dapp’s smart contracts.’ So, to be counted by DappRadar, a user needs to make a blockchain transaction.” It noted that any dapp activity outside of the blockchain ecosystem is generally not tracked, which could account for discrepancies between its measurements and measurements reported from the dapps themselves.  Specifically, it noted that the key metrics it provides for metaverse worlds are based on smart contracts, “which are mainly submitted by dapp developers.”  “The Decentraland team is currently updating their list of smart contracts and we’re therefore recalculating their metrics,” it added. “Dapp developers can claim ownership over their presence on DappRadar, and provide all the necessary smart contracts to track their project properly.”  DappRadar’s statement follows a recent CoinDesk report sharing data from the platform, which suggested that Decentraland had only 38 “active users” last Friday. Decentraland has since said that it sees an average of 8,000 “daily active users,” calling other data measurements for “daily active users” into question.  In a statement, Decentraland explained that it considers an “active user” to be “someone who enters Decentraland and moves out of the initial parcel they entered the world into.” It added that it is now working with DappRadar to improve its data tracking.  “Initially, DappRadar was only tracking 13 Decentraland contracts - they will now track over 3,000 and will begin working on a way to include meta-transactions in their tracking as well,” the metaverse platform wrote.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MANA,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/10/11/dappradar-says-its-recalculating-decentraland-user-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/529523994b073558942d6c132ddf3bbe0b86391a-1897x1423.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The fund will be liquidated at the end of October, said the company in a statement, and then delisted from Nasdaq where it has traded since December 2021. Investors who hold the exchange-traded fund through liquidation will get a cash redemption for the value of their shares, according to regulatory filings.  The fund’s dissolution “was the best course of action,” Valkyrie said, noting the decision to cut it was “part of an ongoing review of products aimed at ensuring the firm best meets client demand.”  Investors never showed much demand for Valkyrie’s third ETF, where the largest positions are Tesla (TSLA) and MicroStrategy (MSTR), companies known for holding bitcoin on their balance sheets. Net assets under management are currently only about $570,000, a miniscule number for ETFs.  VBB’s lineup of crypto-savvy stocks (not all of them held bitcoin) underperformed the S&P 500 for the year to date, shedding over 50% of its value versus a 25% decline for the benchmark index.

The platform immortalized the media giant’s most significant archival moments – from Nelson Mandela’s release from prison to Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s swearing-in ceremony – as NFT collectibles. Vault partnered with Dapper Labs, the creator of the moments-based sports collection NBA Topshot, to mint its moments on the Flow blockchain.  In its statement, Vault encouraged people to head to its Discord channel to learn more about what shuttering its platform means for collectors. The move prompted some to accuse CNN of orchestrating a rug pull – a type of crypto scam where creators pull the plug on a project suddenly and make off with investor funds. Others said they were disappointed by promises of long-term utility for holders, including exclusive perks, merchandise, upgrades and discounts on future drops.  A CNN staff member, “Jason,” said in the Discord channel that the platform plans to compensate collectors over the coming weeks by paying them roughly 20% of the tokens’ original mint price in either stablecoins or FLOW, the native token behind Flow.  In Discord, Vault specified that users can still trade their NFTs on Flow-compatible marketplaces, as well as on other dapps in the ecosystem.

42422208,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0if1h,1665521639,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Remains in a Quiet Place Ahead of FOMC Minutes,"Price Action  Bitcoin and ether traded flat on Tuesday, continuing a theme of low volume and volatility in digital asset markets in recent weeks.  Bitcoin (BTC) trading volume fell below its 20-day moving average for the seventh consecutive day, and 10th of the last 11. Bitcoin’s price continued its recent decline, falling 0.45% over the past 24 hours. The drop was the sixth negative day out of the last seven. The average true range of BTC price movement has fallen 22% so far in October, an indication of decreasing volatility.  Ether (ETH) trading volume fell below its 20-day moving average for the 11th consecutive day. The price fell 0.66% and now sits below the psychologically important $1,300 mark. Echoing BTC, ETH’s price has stagnated in recent weeks and been largely range-bound since Sept 21.  In broader crypto markets, the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, fell 0.90%. The top gainer on Tuesday was terraUSD, up 34% to 5 cents, while the top declining asset was quantstamp(QSP), down 22%. BinanceUSD (BUSD) was the top traded crypto asset on Tuesday.  Macro View  Traditional financial markets were mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increasing 0.12%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 fell 1.10%, and 0.65%, respectively.  Breadth measures in traditional finance imply continued selling pressure because 71% of stocks trading on the NYSE, Nasdaq and NYSE American (formerly AMEX) exchanges declined compared with 22% that traded higher. Market breadth measures the number of assets trading higher compared to the number of assets trading lower.  In commodities, crude oil traded lower as West Texas Intermediate oil declined 1.7% to fall below $90 per barrel. European Brent crude declined 1.6% to $94.61 per barrel. In metals, copper futures, often used as an indication of economic growth fell 0.03%. Traditional safe haven gold rose 0.14%.  Latest Prices  ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): 936.32 −1.7%        ● Bitcoin (BTC): $19,042 −1.0%        ● Ether (ETH): $1,285 −1.7%        ● S&P 500 daily close: 3,588.84 −0.7%        ● Gold: $1,673 per troy ounce +0.4%        ● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.94% +0.05        Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  Another Quiet Trading Day for Bitcoin  Bitcoin traded flat again Tuesday as macroeconomic themes continued to weigh heavily on investors who are now waiting for the release of the minutes of the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday, and the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data on Thursday. Trading volume has been tepid.  Economic observers widely believe the CPI will tick slightly downward to 8.1% annually, although month over month they expect a 0.1% price increase. The FOMC’s next rate decision should reflect the Fed’s priority in taming inflation.  BTC continues to behave as though it’s a “mean reversion” trade, as prices toggle above and below its 20-day moving average before reversing course back to its mean.  Appearing more clearly on its hourly than daily chart, BTC’s price has tended to show above-average volume during hours when the price breaches the upper range of its Bollinger Bands before reversing course.  To the extent traders can execute a nimble mean reversion trading strategy, they are likely to find opportunity in this market. Traders looking to find a trending asset class won’t find as much, given current price behavior. Investors looking to establish a longer-term position while minimizing their cost basis may find positive news on-chain, but not without cause for concern.  Glassnode data shows that “whale” net volume to and from exchanges has been declining since Sept 16. Whales are investors holding at least 1,000 BTC.  Movement of coins off centralized exchanges is price supportive because those coins are likely being moved into cold storage. Movement of BTC to exchanges implies that coins are intended to be sold.  Glassnode data also indicates that the cost basis for whales since 2017 is approximately $15,800. BTC’s price has decreased 5% since Sept. 16. With the price now within 25% of the cost basis for large BTC holders, they have been moving BTC off exchanges.  While not necessarily a bullish catalyst, this trend provides insight into where sentiment lies for BTC holders with the most aggregate exposure.  A note of caution, however, can be gleaned from derivatives markets. Specifically, there has been an uptick in the open interest for puts at the $19,000 strike price. Additionally, the put/call ratio for BTC has increased, indicating that traders are purchasing additional downside protection.

42422204,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0ieth,1665518867,South African Non-Profit Bitcoin Ekasi Opens Education Center,"Bitcoin Ekasi, a nonprofit organization seeking to establish a bitcoin economy in Mossel Bay, South Africa, has opened the Bitcoin Ekasi Center. The center will provide financial literacy education to local residents, with a focus on the area’s younger generation and business community.  The center was co-founded by Hermann Vivier, who also co-founded The Surfer Kids, a non-profit that teaches surfing and life skills to disadvantaged kids from the same locale. Bitcoin Ekasi has already enrolled 20 kids into its program and set up 10 stores to accept bitcoin for payment.  “Ekasi” is South African for “township.” Bitcoin Ekasi is Vivier’s attempt to create a circular bitcoin economy in Mossel Bay’s JCC Camp township – a poverty-stricken community overlooking the Indian Ocean. A circular bitcoin economy is one where individuals receive and make payments in bitcoin as they would with a traditional fiat currency.  “We recently celebrated Bitcoin Ekasi’s first anniversary and it's a surreal feeling to officially open the center. In that time I have witnessed financial empowerment through bitcoin – affecting seemingly unrelated social issues in positive ways,” Vivier said in a press release. “Through the Bitcoin Ekasi Center, I am honored that our team will be able to grow this movement and inspire other communities to think differently about money.”  The center will provide basic math and English training to younger residents. Adults will receive training on foundational bitcoin topics with a focus on three key questions: one, what is bitcoin; two, how does it work; and three, why is it important?  “Our society is based around money: who has it, how to get it, ways to grow it, what to do with it. For the millions of people who are unable to access banks and credit, bitcoin is a real solution for them to be able to join those conversations. That’s why local education is vital and why Paxful is committed to bitcoin’s purpose over price,” said Ray Youssef, founder and CEO of Paxful, a popular peer-to-peer exchange that operates in several key African markets, in the press release.

42421242,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhsLt,1665517742,Casper Labs Has Its Sights Set on Enterprise,"“Institutions are coming” is a common mantra for mainstream adoption in crypto. The idea implies a huge flow of capital into the $1 trillion crypto market, and the accelerated maturing of crypto as an asset class.  But when institutions come, where do they go and who do they trust?  Mrinal Manohar, the CEO and co-founder of Casper Labs, says he knows what the institutions want. To that end, Casper Labs’ eponymous project, Casper Network, a layer 1 blockchain, already works with blue chip companies like IBM.  Mrinal Manohar is presenting at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk's newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy that will attract institutional capital in the years to come.  Casper finished testing and was launched on mainnet in March 2021. ​​The project raised $14.5 million in 2019 from investors including Arrington XRP Capital and Wall Street’s jack-of-all-trades, Terren Scott Peizer.  Blockchain technology and projects built on that technology rely on two domains of expertise: finance and computer science. Conveniently for Manohar, he has a background in both.  Before starting Casper, Manohar was a principal and sector head of technology, media and telecom at Sagard Capital, a hedge fund with a long-only strategy worth about $1 billion. He also previously served as a private equity associate at Bain Capital in Boston, and as an associate consultant at Bain & Company. He has a Master of Science degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University.  Unlike most players in crypto from traditional backgrounds, he’s an early entrant in the space.  See also: DIMO Helps Drivers Gain and Monetize Their Car Data  “I discovered bitcoin in 2010 because my roommate at the time [...] was one of the biggest miners in the world. Bear in mind, this is 2010 – there's no Coinbase. You're writing keys down on paper,” he told CoinDesk. “So he had a rack of servers and he was like 5% of hash power.”  Manohar started buying his first stacks of bitcoin in late 2011 and early 2012 directly from his former roommate from grad school. His other early bets included seed investing in Ethereum, Blockstack, Basis, Maker, Filecoin and several others.  Although peer-to-peer interaction laid the foundations of his origin story in the blockchain space, he soon turned his attention to enterprise.  “I realized that neither on the structure side nor the product side was a blockchain company or protocol that was really taking care of the needs of enterprise. And that's what led me to found Casper Labs – to be a software developer who helps do that.”  For multi-functional blockchains serving the needs of enterprise, innovation is an integral part of the tech stack offering. Casper provides a highly adaptable blockchain environment on which enterprises can operate. Smart contracts aren’t immutable – that is, not immutable in the future, but immutable in the past. And that’s a crucial difference, Manohar explains. Enterprise wants control over their tech infrastructure as things may change in the future – changes may come from regulations, business needs, and new technical developments.  “Whenever I say this, some people are like, ‘Oh my God, you can't use the words ‘control’ and ‘blockchain’ in the same sentence,’ and I'm like, ‘No, it's not that they want control over the blockchain. The blockchain is completely decentralized. They want control over their application,’” Manohar said.  That makes it easier to implement and scale new features on the blockchain. If a company has a market mortgage determined by a smart contract, and the rules of how mortgages are deployed change (as they often do), then the smart contract will also be upgradeable.  See also: How One Scientist-Turned-Founder Is Bridging Drug Discovery with Blockchain  Manohar thinks it isn’t just the technical and legal infrastructure of current offerings in the blockchain space that are insufficient for enterprise needs. There’s also a hype-driven culture that dominates the marketing ethos of crypto companies. The incentive structure is kind of broken, too, he explained.  “Investors get some tokens [with] two [or] three-year vest[ing periods], and then people go away. If the protocol is successful and gets hype, people make a ton of money and they go buy cars. It leads to really bad habits. Enterprises hate associating with people who they think are scammy or hypey or like, too cool for school,” Manohar told CoinDesk.  The enterprise sales cycle is very long, he said – nothing like the mayfly-like cycle of most crypto projects – which means you need to build a company that is oriented for the long term. Manohar says he’s certainly in it for the long haul.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/11/casper-labs-has-its-sights-set-on-enterprise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/799a3433b73b52d40bf2c20e8bece76f5243d6ae-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411336,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNECj,1665515239,Reversibility on Ethereum: The Benefits and Pitfalls,"Imagine that one day you absentmindedly fall victim to a crypto phishing scam, the perpetrator stealing 10 ether (ETH) from you. Crypto transactions are final so there's not much that you can do, right?  Well, not so fast.  To ensure that stolen crypto gets returned to its rightful owner, a group of Stanford researchers recently raised the idea of introducing reversible transactions to Ethereum. If such a standard were to be adopted, your stolen 10 ETH could, in theory at least, boomerang back into your wallet, the frustrated thief being left out of pocket.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  Reversibility would probably be a popular feature, especially among the risk-averse who have until now refused to adopt Ethereum. But there are costs to consider, too.  With any payments system, tweaking one element to solve a particular problem means introducing a new set of problems somewhere else along the network. There's no such thing as a free fix. Let’s dig into what these costs are.  Reversible transactions on Ethereum  Crypto theft is everywhere, from large-scale exploits to small retail phishing scams. To make the crypto economy safer, Kaili Wang and colleagues have floated the idea of introducing an Ethereum token standard that allows transactions to be temporarily reversible. During that time period, say four days, a victim of a theft could appeal to a decentralized adjudicator to have their stolen crypto returned.  Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of the Bitcoin blockchain, would be shocked. After all, Nakamoto's white paper can be read as a diatribe against reversible transactions. Financial institutions ""cannot avoid mediating disputes,"" wrote Nakamoto, and as a result merchants must be ""wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.""  But the Stanford researchers don’t intend for Ethereum to be 100% reversible. People who don't like the idea of reversible tokens could continue to limit their interactions to non-reversible tokens. As for those who are intimidated by the high degree of expertise required to safely use Ethereum, reversible tokens could be the extra guardrail that draws them in.  Now the costs.  Welcome, reversal fraud  Payments systems involve many complex trade-offs. Solving one problem means adding another problem. A good way to think about this is in terms of the following too-small-blanket dilemma.  Say that you want to go to sleep but your blanket doesn't cover your toes. You pull it down, but now your neck is uncovered. You rotate the blanket to cover both your toes and neck, but now your shoulders are exposed. There is no perfect fix. You need to pick and choose what part of your body to cover and what part to leave exposed.  The same goes for payments. While reversibility may help reduce theft, the too-small-blanket dilemma dictates that it could open the network up to new problems, in particular forms of reversal fraud.  Credit card systems provide a good idea of what to expect.  Credit card owners can dispute card payments and have them “charged back,” or reversed. While this feature protects honest users from card theft, fraudsters take advantage of this feature by making purchases and then disputing the charge, falsely claiming they have not received the item or service. Merchants lose billions of dollars every year to credit card chargeback fraud.  Read more: Stanford Proposal for Reversible Ethereum Transactions Divides Crypto Community  Or take the example of PayPal. For risk-averse shoppers, the ability to dispute and reverse PayPal transactions is a helpful feature. But it has given rise to all sorts of PayPal fraud. In a PayPal overpayment scam, for instance, a scammer takes advantage of PayPal's dispute system to overpay a seller for something, then asks the seller for a refund of the excess. After the overpayment is returned, the scammer asks PayPal to reverse the original transaction. The seller effectively loses the overpayment amount.  PayPal or Visa could do away with overpayment scams and chargeback fraud by making all transactions non-reversible. But then their systems would become less friendly for risk-averse buyers, and adoption would suffer. It's the too-small-blanket problem.  My gut feeling is, go for it.  So the price to pay for reversible Ethereum transactions is an inevitable wave of reversal fraud. The decentralized judicial system the Stanford researchers envisaged would quickly be flooded with scammers trying to take advantage of that very reversibility. Weeding out these scams would increase the judges’ overall adjudicating costs.  Providing a degree of protection from theft may very well be worth the hassles of reversal fraud. But the point to remember is this: There is a price to pay for introducing new features. Nothing is free.  Not so fungible  Introducing reversibility to Ethereum would also have implications for fungibility. When something is fungible, assets are perfectly interchangeable. Fungibility is an attractive feature of a payment system. If all dollars are interchangeable, then it makes the dollar payments system easier to use.  Reversibility would split the Ethereum network in half. Rather than swapping reversible tokens with each other, sophisticated traders would mostly stick to non-reversible tokens. The prospect of having one's $10 million trade unwound because of an appeal by a previous owner for a reverse is just too risky.  But not-so-sophisticated users would probably choose the peace-of-mind of reversible tokens.  Splitting the network in half wouldn't be a big deal if the two token types traded on a 1:1 basis. Alas, they probably wouldn't.  An opt-in reversible standard would create a warmer and fuzzier Ethereum.  Imagine that Jack owes 100 stablecoins to Jill. There are two ways that Jack can pay Jill, with reversible stablecoins or non-reversible ones. Jill will prefer the non-reversible ones. Reversible ones introduce the risk that a transaction will be unwound, leaving her out of pocket. And so she’ll tell Jack that he can either pay her 100 worth of non-reversible stablecoin or 105 in reversible ones. That’s non-fungibility.  As the four-day reversibility window comes to a close and the danger of a reverse ends, reversible stablecoins would move back to par with regular non-reversible stablecoins. But until then there would be two different prices for the same instrument.  It's another instance of the too-small-blanket dilemma. By adding a new layer of protection, an extra layer of confusion has been introduced.  The Ethereum network would still be usable. Much of the extra burden of non-fungibility would probably be borne by specialist risk appraisers, or brokers, who profit by buying consumers' reversible tokens at a discount (in exchange for non-reversible tokens), and holding them to maturity. As Satoshi suggested, these intermediaries may have to “hassle customers” for extra information in order to protect against reversals.  Even after considering the twin costs of non-fungibility and new types of Ethereum-based fraud, reversible transactions may still be worth it. While non-reversibility may be great for traders, corporations and the tech elite, the enduring popularity of PayPal and credit cards demonstrate that what regular folks want is safety. An opt-in reversible standard would create a warmer and fuzzier Ethereum, one that is more inclusive and attracts a wider range of users.  My gut feeling is, go for it.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/11/reversibility-on-ethereum-the-benefits-and-pitfalls,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0323c735b3a6c08b1b397fd87688d2220e84892-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The platform will now allow creators to mint, list and trade NFTs on the layer 1 network.  Avalanche, primarily touted as a decentralized finance (DeFi) chain, is often mentioned as a challenger to Ethereum with its fast transaction speeds and low gas fees. On the other hand, Avalanche has not yet had a strong presence in the NFT space, which this new partnership aims to address.  A spokesperson for Ava Labs, the firm behind Avalanche, told CoinDesk the chain’s bridge released in June revealed “surprising” insights about the chain’s amount of DeFi activity, and that “a lot of people will discover the same [surprise] about Avalanche NFTs with OpenSea joining the community.”  OpenSea has been rolling out its marketplace to additional chains this past year. In March, it implemented Solana in the wake of the network’s growing foray into the NFT space. Last month it added support for Ethereum rollup Arbitrum.

42422221,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0ieTh,1665513520,Bitcoin Recovers $19K Though Inflation Fears Haunt Market,"Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the $19,000 mark, rebounding with traditional markets after earlier Tuesday touching the lowest price in almost two weeks.  The CoinDesk Market Index fell by 0.22% over the past 24 hours. At press time, bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, was changing hands around $19,100, up from the low of $18,860 earlier Tuesday. Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-largest overall, was down 1.7%.  Bitcoin appeared to be staying in sync with traditional markets, where stocks rose as investors scooped up bargains after a five-day losing spell in the S&P 500.  Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk that sentiment around bitcoin remains bearish, with the U.S. Federal Reserve expected to keep tightening monetary policy to tamp down soaring inflation.  The U.S. Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index report for September, due out Thursday, is expected to show inflation slowing to 8.1% from 8.3%, but the elevated rate would still represent four times the Fed’s 2% target for price rises.  “Until the Fed signals a return to easing, markets are likely to remain under pressure,” DiPasquale told CoinDesk via an email. “Now BTC needs to retain $19,000 to prevent sharper downside moves.”  Over the past week, digital asset markets have held up better than stocks, but the correlation between the asset classes remains strong, and analysts say cryptocurrencies might continue to follow traditional markets.  Russia-Ukraine implications  The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war continues to sow anxiety and turbulence throughout global markets. According to the BBC, Russian strikes continued into Tuesday, with at least 19 people killed across Ukraine, including in Kiev. One concern is whether escalating geopolitical concerns might hit the economy, possibly damping any mood among investors for risk taking.  According to Reuters, Turkey’s defense minister, after a phone call with his Russian counterpart, said Tuesday in a statement that he emphasized “the importance of declaring a ceasefire urgently.”  A ceasefire could be a straightforward catalyst to carry global markets “out of the dark,“ according to Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner at STORM Partners. “This seems to be rather unlikely, seeing the current situation.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/11/bitcoin-recovers-19k-though-inflation-fears-haunt-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35c4631169a9bccdb9588f31d15ad1e91288239d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sun, who is one of five advisers on Huobi’s global advisory board, told CoinDesk TV this hypothetical situation will depend on the Chinese government changing its stance on cryptocurrencies, and would require “thorough due diligence of the exchange.”  “In the future we might have a chance to purchase Huobi, but not this time,” Sun said during an appearance on “First Mover” on Tuesday. He spoke days after Hong Kong-based About Capital announced plans to buy Huobi, a major crypto exchange throughout Asia.  Read more: Crypto Exchange Huobi Global to be Acquired by About Capital  In August, Huobi’s founder Leon Li said he was looking to sell a majority of his stake in the exchange for upwards of $3 billion, Bloomberg reported. FTX founder Sam-Bankman Fried reportedly expressed interest but nothing came of it.  No matter who owns Huobi, its China plans would depend on a change in thinking by the nation's leaders. In September 2021, China’s regulators banned crypto trading, pushing a majority of crypto exchanges, including Huobi, out of the country. It wasn’t the first time the country has banned crypto.  Still, even after China’s latest ban all but wiped out legitimate bitcoin mining in the country, Sun remains “optimistic” about cryptocurrency in China. Crypto, he said, is a “world trend” that cannot be isolated.  “That’s why China [will] definitely be one of the most stronger (sic) players in the blockchain industry,” Sun said, “even [if] we might have some setback or regulation hurdle in the short term.

But in order for Huobi to compete on a global scale, Sun said the exchange needs traction on its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, HUSD.

42422206,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0iezh,1665509601,"Bitcoin Options Traders, Burned by Last Month’s CPI Report, Now Seek Downside Protection","Bitcoin (BTC) traders have turned cautious ahead of a monthly report expected later this week on U.S. inflation. One reason might be because they were burned by wrong-way positioning the last time the Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures were released.  The Labor Department on Thursday is likely to report that the core CPI data, which strips out the impact of volatile food and energy prices, accelerated to a year-on-year pace of 6.5% in September, from August's 6.3%. The headline figure, which includes all goods and services, is seen slowing a touch to an annual 8.1% from 8.3%, according to FactSet.  The core CPI is considered a better indicator of underlying inflation. So an uptick would back the case for continued rapid-fire Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes that have wrecked risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, this year.  A glimpse at crypto options markets would suggest that investors are using trades to protect themselves from the risk the CPI report could trigger renewed downside volatility in bitcoin.  The seven-day ""call-put skew,"" which measures the cost of calls relative to puts, has dropped from -5% to -10% in recent days. In other words, bitcoin puts – derivative contracts offering downside protection – are becoming more expensive than calls, which are typically seen as bullish bets.  With global markets on edge, bitcoin has been holding its own recently, trading just below the $20,000 level but so far avoiding a deeper sell-off.  ""We have seen large buying in October expiry bitcoin puts at $17,500 and $18,500 strikes ahead of the CPI,"" Shiliang Tang, chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund Ledger Prime, said.  The recent decline in the short-duration call-put skew is in stark contrast from the trend seen a month ago when the metric crossed above zero, suggesting a bias for calls.  Back then, traders were snapping up bullish bets on speculation the inflation data (released Sept. 13) would show price pressures cooled in August – and ostensibly making it easier for the Federal Reserve to pivot away from its liquidity-tightening campaign.  However, inflation came in hotter than expected, dashing the Fed pivot hopes and trapping call buyers on the wrong side of the market. Bitcoin fell by nearly 10% on the same day, with the skew falling below zero in favor of puts.  ""Last month, ahead of the inflation data, traders bid weekly calls, pushing the seven-day call-put skew above the positive territory,"" Gregoire Magadini, CEO of options analytics platform Genesis Volatility, told CoinDesk. ""However, that trade was a huge loser. As such, traders are staying away from such bets this time.""  The preference for puts is also evident from the put-call volume ratio, which has doubled since Friday.  Some traders are buying ""gamma"" in anticipation of a big move after the CPI print, according to Singapore-based crypto options trading giant QCP Capital.  Buying gamma, or being long gamma, means purchasing a call, put or both. The long gamma positions make money when the underlying asset, such as BTC in this case, charts a big move in either direction and bleed money if the underlying remains dull. In other words, these are bets that price volatility, or ""vol,"" will increase.  ""In the crypto vol space, we are seeing heavy demand"" for front-end short duration options, Singapore-based options trading giant QCP Capital said in its Telegram-based channel. ""The market is buying up gamma ahead of Thursday's print.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/11/looming-us-cpi-report-has-bitcoin-investors-seeking-protection-in-case-inflation-tops-expectations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a3b72007f64faed9f76dbce3b7486c80fc3b067-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421238,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhsDd,1665508723,Lit Protocol: Public Key Infrastructure for a Decentralized World,"With the current model of Web3, your private key is either custodied by you or it’s custodied by a corporation such as an exchange like Coinbase.  Lit Protocol, which will be featured at CoinDesk’s upcoming IDEAS conference, is neither of those two categories of wallets.  David Sneider is presenting at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk's newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy that will attract institutional capital in the years to come.  Learn directly from entrepreneurs in leading innovation across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse. Register here.  Lit Protocol is a decentralized network that functionally serves as a decentralized programmable key. Through a process called, “threshold cryptography,” Lit decentralizes a private key and has it live in a distributed way across the Lit nodes.  According to CEO David Sneider, before Lit the option was to “use Amazon’s key management service to store the key,” but this is a problem because the application developer is totally trusted and can “rug with the key at any time.”  With Lit, the private key is held in decentralized custody. A developer can design a beautiful application, but can never get out the key.  Lit Protocol has two main functions currently: decentralized access control and decentralized cloud signing.  On the access control side, Lit Protocol focuses on who can read private and permissioned data that is stored on the open web like on blockchains and decentralized storage systems.  Users can specifically store private data on the open web and use Lit to provision decentralized keys to users based on on-chain data, like the assets they hold in their wallet.  As an application development network, Lit allows developers to create a decentralized token-gated chat where, for instance, only owners of Miladies can access the chat. And when a new person shows up and wants to access this specific chat, they have to sign a message to prove that they own a Milady. Lit then provisions the new person the private key to decrypt the token-gated chat and interact with its members.  Through Lit Protocol, an individual user can “have their own encrypted shard of the open web,” Sneider said.  Lit Protocol centers around “automating writes,” he explained, whereby an application can have signing happen on a user’s behalf. Any given user – whether it’s for a cross-chain application, financial application, data sovereignty application – can basically write a program that signs a transaction when a specific event happens. As a result of that, the capacity to perform that action is where the cross-chain piece comes in. “You can say, activity happens on one chain, sign a transaction on another chain,” Sneider said.  A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) can now have a private, interoperable key that’s held in distributed custody that can interact with several blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cosmos, while creating rules on what it wants those interactions to do and to be.  What makes Lit Protocol different from a traditional self-custody key is the encryption and decryption rights for some specific content can happen based on certain programmable rules. Sneider said it’s incongruous to build a decentralized internet without a decentralized private key system.  If Ethereum is the world’s ledger or money computer, and InterPlanetary File Sharing System (IPFS) is a new form of database, Lit would be “the world’s root key,” according to Sneider.  Lit Protocol is still in R&D mode, however. Similar to Ethereum, Bitcoin, Filecoin and Chainlink, Lit is a decentralized network of nodes that provides a service, and as such, a token will eventually be associated with the Lit Protocol Network. Sneider indicated that while the token model is not publicly live yet, the tokens will incentivize nodes to be good stewards of the ecosystem.  Lit Protocol raised $13 million in a Series A round led by crypto investment firm 1kx and included participation from 6thMan Ventures, OpenSea Ventures and A Capital.  David Sneider, co-founder and CEO of Lit Protocol will take the stage at CoinDeskIDEAS to discuss “Decentralized Cloud Keys” on Oct. 18-19 in New York City.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIL,Sage D.

42421247,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhsOz,1665508126,dClimate: Smart Contracts for the Warming World,"Smart contracts are the bread and butter of blockchains. They’re often used in the complex money legos of decentralized finance (DeFi), often unintelligible to the general public and even most businesses. But can smart contracts also be deployed to help address the needs in, say, mostly analog industries like agriculture?  When blockchain evangelists talk about smart contracts, they tend to cite real-world use cases like smart contract-enabled insurance payouts to farmers in the event of on-chain conditions triggered by certain types of weather.  Sid Jha is presenting at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk's newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy that will attract institutional capital in the years to come.  Sid Jha, a Wall Street veteran, has slowly built a business empire leveraging smart contracts just like in that example.  His duo of businesses are dClimate and Arbol.  dClimate is a decentralized marketplace for a rich array of climate data – forecasts and models – where data providers meet with buyers. It has a built-in feature to make the data more transparent by scoring the reliability of that data.  Think of it like a clearinghouse for the climate data. Under current centralized systems, different parties aren’t really encouraged to contribute data in a common open-source standard, Jha told CoinDesk. “An open-source platform brings trust and accountability to the platform,” he said.  Decentralization also allows a much wider group of contributors. Many of the best climate models are in academia, Jha explained, but they have difficulty accessing users and reaching a broader audience.  “So by being able to access the climates network, which can grow in a very organic way, you can have people putting up the best versions of forecast models, carbon monitoring models, and these can then be validated by how good your forecast for drought in, say, the Midwest is,” Jha said. “And these can all be validated in an immutable way on-chain.”  One of the beneficiaries of that climate platform is Arbol, Jha’s New York-based insurance company, offering weather insurance powered by smart contracts.  Smart contracts are programs composed of functions (“if X happens, then do Y”) and input (like the rainfall data). That input could come from external sources via oracles, which are like bridges between the blockchain and the real world. For Arbol, that bridge is provided by Chainlink, an Ethereum-based oracle network. Chainlink oracles provide access to blockchain-enforced weather coverage that helps smart contracts settle the terms immediately based on that weather data.  Once a smart contract is deployed on the blockchain it can never be deleted and any interaction with it is irreversible. This immutability is a big deal for the financial aspects of climate risk, like insurance underwriting.  “A lot of the climate data sits in very archaic servers for government agencies, academic agencies, other nonprofits, and often can be overwritten which makes it difficult to use for financial applications, like parametric insurance,” Jha told CoinDesk.  “Blockchain creates that immutable ledger and tracks all the revisions, and all the different changes that happened in the data.”  Blockchain helps Arbol differ from others in the insurance market. Its risk evaluation process for the purposes of insurance payouts is parametric, which means its contracts payout takes into account predetermined, verifiable and objective metrics set at the time of policy underwriting.  It is predetermined in the sense that the client chooses a relevant index at the beginning of their contract. If that index is met according to the applicable dataset, the client receives a payout. By design, parametric processes reduce the risks of fraudulent claims, speed up the claim process, and simplify the whole process, freeing everyone from piles of paperwork.  Arbol transacted $100 million of premium in the first half of 2022, more than in 2021. It has more than 700 institutional clients and more than $1 billion of available risk capacity.  “Climate risk affects us all,” Jha said. “If you run a small business, then your supply chain and your revenues are often very much linked to weather, and unexpected weather can be devastating. Farming is a great example, but that's just one example.”  “It could be a hotel in a tourist area. It could be a wind farm, where wind speed variations have caused big disruptions to their cash flows. Or a power utility, where sudden spikes in summer temperatures can lead to excess air conditioning demand and sudden need to buy power and very expensive rates to supply the consumer,” Jha explained.  “So this is about really taking a broader view around the effect of climate risk on our supply chains across the economy, large and small.”  Prior to Arbol and dClimate, Jha worked for more than 13 years in the financial industry. As a quantitative researcher and also trader, he specialized in interest rates and commodities.  At one point, Jha was a vice president of interest rates strategy at JPMorgan. He also authored a book on the subject, ""Interest Rate Markets,"" published in both English and Mandarin.  “I spent 2008–2009 in the interest rate world and that showed me many of the vulnerabilities of the banking system,” Jha said. “And so there was always a natural attraction to a decentralized solution to do finance.”  Sid Jha will appear at CoinDesk IDEAS on October 18-19 in New York City.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LINK | MARKET | REGULATION,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/11/smart-contracts-for-the-warming-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ffabb25a8c92ff9739b085317f211776dd58805-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411339,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNEMe,1665507579,Bitcoin: Breaking Up Money and State,"For the first time in human history, a technology has been created that once and for all divorces money from the state. This separation of money and state is poised to transform the way we think about value and our expectations of government involvement in our financial lives, and may be the largest cultural-political shift since the separation of church and state.  Bitcoin cannot be created at the whim of some centralized power, taking away the ability of governments to spend wantonly. It may sound utopian, but once humanity evolves to a Bitcoin standard the government-created boom-bust cycle, constant inflation and ability to fund wars will be things of the past.  Will Szamosszegi is founder and CEO of Sazmining.  Bitcoin is a digitally native currency that runs on a decentralized ledger called a blockchain. Unlike the Federal Reserve, which has never been audited, Bitcoin’s ledger is audited every 10 minutes by hordes of nodes across the globe.  Without the ability to create money out of thin air, governments will instead have to tax its citizens directly.  Raising taxes is typically a tough sell, even when the proceeds are expected to be used for domestic goods like public health or education. But citizens will be highly unlikely to accept tax increases for any war that is not purely defensive. For all we know, America’s Middle Eastern adventures of the last two decades may not have occurred had we already been on a Bitcoin standard.  See also: Bitcoin Should Change ... Slowly - CoinDesk | Opinion  A Bitcoin standard will drastically damp the boom-bust cycle. Central banks – if they still exist – will be constrained by Bitcoin such that they will be unable to lend out easy money. First of all, the only money they could create out of thin air would only be a second-layer money, not bitcoin itself.  People will be skeptical at accepting any non-bitcoin currency, and so central banks’ clientele will be far more limited than it is now. Furthermore, even if some people do accept the central banks’ second-layer currency, those people will struggle to find others who would accept it as payment.  In short, on a Bitcoin standard, creating money out of thin air and handing it out is not a workable business model.  Finally, a Bitcoin standard is the (gradual) death of inflation. Bitcoin’s supply schedule is preprogrammed such that the supply will increase at a predictable and decreasing rate until there are 21 million bitcoin in circulation. At that point, no more bitcoin will ever be mined. Assuming that humanity continues to innovate, then prices of goods and services will fall over time.  In other words, Bitcoin’s purchasing power will continuously rise in proportion to the amount of wealth that humanity creates.  See also: The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin Maximalism | Opinion  Thanks to Bitcoin, humanity now possesses a technology that governments cannot ban even if they try. This may have sounded bold in 2008 when Bitcoin was first invented but it is far too late to stop the decentralized network now. Remember how China tried to ban bitcoin mining in the country, then the largest supplier of network hash power? Instead it proved how resilient bitcoin is. Mining thrives around the world, including as a Chinese black market.  Bitcoin also has powerful allies now. El Salvador and the Central African Republic have made bitcoin legal tender. North American politicians including Cynthia Lummis, Jared Polis and Pierre Poilievre are ardent bitcoin supporters. Bitcoin even played a significant role in the Canadian trucker protests of early 2022, as well as in the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. More and more will likely become “orange-pilled,” as the saying goes, referring to bitcoin's orange symbol.  While the State may not like losing its monopolistic control over money, it is quite difficult to convince people that inflation is good for them and that a deflationary asset is bad for them. Therefore, out of citizens' mere self-interest, bitcoin will gradually force the State to give up on its control over money.  While the separation of Church and State has always been imperfectly implemented, the separation of money and State will be real, total, and permanent.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Will Szamosszegi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/11/bitcoin-breaking-up-money-and-state,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8940f4c33bd685bc41ced77e9abe20bcaff37754-2048x1638.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422194,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0iebh,1665507108,"Ooki DAO Case So ‘Egregious,’ CFTC Had No Choice, Chair Behnam Says","The controversial case against Ooki DAO was “so egregious and so obvious” that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had to pursue it, said Chairman Rostin Behnam.  People getting involved with a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) should be aware they’re not immune to government attention, Behnam said Tuesday at DC Fintech Week in Washington, D.C. His agency highlighted this last month when it settled accusations against blockchain protocol and company bZeroX (bZx) and two of its founders, which the regulator accused of offering illegal trading and lending services. But the real drama came from the CFTC also formally suing Ooki itself for wrongdoing as bZeroX’s successor.  ""It was hardly decentralized,” Behnam said. “There were a few individuals who were very much at the center.""  He added that “it was pretty clear that a few individuals were clearly trying to evade our rules,"" saying they openly sought the DAO path as a way to avoid regulators.  Ooki’s participants are running out of time to defend the organization against the CFTC’s enforcement action, creating a potential win for the agency.  Despite crypto generally growing in a regulatory limbo and U.S. officials and lawmakers spending much of their time lately debating how it should be overseen by the government, Behnam argued that this was an obvious case of “clear fraud.”  He said the CFTC would have been “failing to do our job if we didn’t bring this case.”  And Behnam contends that a theoretically decentralized approach to finance won’t help participants avoid U.S. laws and oversight.  ""Don't expect this to be a free pass,"" he said.  Behnam has been pursuing a much longer reach for his agency when it comes to crypto, asking Congress to give it power to oversee the spot market for digital commodity tokens. That’s a favored idea in more than one piece of legislation introduced this year, but the bills will likely have to wait for the next Congress after November’s midterm elections (and the bills themselves don’t always clearly define where the CFTC’s jurisdiction might begin and end).  He said the U.S. government will have to make changes to regulate crypto in what he called an “evolutionary time” in the markets.  ""We're going to have to adapt. There is no doubt about it,"" he said. “This technology is very different. It's very new, and all the agencies are going to have to adapt.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/11/ooki-dao-case-so-egregious-cftc-had-no-choice-chair-behnam-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b1cd761597d91e6f3f82233a3f02c82ed3d1c35-4608x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At issue, the source said, is whether some of Yuga’s non-fungible tokens are closer to stocks and thus should follow the same disclosure rules. The key legal question at the center of the probe, according to Bloomberg, is whether NFTs are securities – a question the SEC has reportedly been investigating since March. People familiar with the matter said at the time that NFT creators and crypto exchanges were being looked at.  The SEC is also reportedly looking into how ApeCoins, the Ethereum-based governance and utility tokens used within the APE ecosystem, were distributed to holders of Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club and Bored Ape Kennel Club members. The tokens were first announced in March with the establishment of the community-driven ApeCoin DAO and the Ape Foundation. Sixty-two percent of the fixed one billion supply of ApeCoins was allocated to the ApeCoin community, including 15% airdropped to existing NFT holders. Additional percentages of tokens were allocated to Yuga Labs and the Jane Goodall Legacy Foundation, alongside launch contributors and the four founders of Bored Ape Yacht Club.  CoinDesk noted at the time that the accompanying press materials appeared to go to great lengths to distance ApeDAO’s token launch from the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. That's because club-style NFTs with perks for long-term members can start to resemble investment contracts, potentially attracting the interest of the SEC.  ApeCoin was falling almost 8% following the publication of Bloomberg’s report.  Read more: What Is ApeCoin and Who Is Behind It?  A spokesperson for Yuga Labs confirmed that it was cooperating with the SEC's probe into the matter.  ""It’s well-known that policymakers and regulators have sought to learn more about the novel world of Web3. We hope to partner with the rest of the industry and regulators to define and shape the burgeoning ecosystem. As a leader in the space, Yuga is committed to fully cooperating with any inquiries along the way,” the spokesperson said.

42421236,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhsFh,1665503947,How Jump Crypto Is Supporting Web3 Projects Across the DeFi Ecosystem,"Prior to his current role in the special projects group at Jump Crypto, Steve Kaminsky began his career in the traditional finance (TradFi) sphere, working in fixed income markets at Goldman Sachs. This experience has helped him understand the differences – and similarities – between these two interrelated worlds. Jump Crypto, the crypto arm of Jump Trading Group, focuses on ecosystem building, infrastructure development, quant research and trading, and has grown to nearly 200 employees globally.  Steve Kaminsky is presenting at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk's newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy that will attract institutional capital in the years to come.  Learn directly from entrepreneurs in leading innovation across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse. Register here.  “The investment arm of Jump Crypto has never been about just deploying capital for the sake of deploying capital,” said Kaminsky. “The real goal is to partner with projects and communities that we believe in and can add our expertise to help grow.”  Jump Crypto’s list of investments includes major exchanges, blockchains and a variety of Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Jump Crypto also has an in-house team of blockchain developers and researchers.  Currently, Jump Crypto is actively leading the interoperability product Wormhole and contributing to the on-chain oracle Pyth, which publishes high-frequency market data directly on-chain. Pyth’s mission is to help solve the oracle problem (which refers to the difficulty of connecting blockchains with external data) by bringing off-chain data to on-chain protocols. Pyth does so by aggregating prices from first-party sources.  “If there are problem areas within the digital asset ecosystem that we think need to be solved and don’t necessarily see promising solutions already in development, we feel empowered and capable to help build within that space. Pyth is a perfect example of this,” said Kaminsky in an email.  There are now nearly 75 data providers today actively contributing to Pyth, including some of the world’s top trading firms, major regulated exchanges and crypto-native firms. Kaminsky said that what makes this community of data providers so unique and powerful is each member owns their own data, greatly increasing the reliability of the network.  “It’s really exciting to see this level of collaboration. While Jump has healthy competition with many of these trading firms in traditional markets, on a project like Pyth we are peers in helping try to build the most robust and reliable crypto infrastructure to support DeFi and Web3. It’s pretty cool to see,” added Kaminsky in an email.  Pyth has been on mainnet, or tested and deployed, for over a year as an on-chain oracle.

42420944,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtvyf,1665503330,Everyrealm Eyes Communities of Scale in the Metaverse,"For all the hype around the metaverse, very few users are actually transacting in the 3-D future of the internet.  A recent CoinDesk report by Cameron Thompson found that Ethereum-based virtual world Decentraland had 38 active users in a given 24-hour period, if one defines “active users” as those conducting a direct wallet transaction with the platform’s smart contract.  Janine Yorio is presenting at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk's newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy.  This point isn’t lost on Janine Yorio, CEO of Everyrealm, a metaverse-focused innovation firm and investment fund, and a speaker at CoinDesk’s upcoming IDEAS conference.  ""Web2 metaverses, like Roblox, Fortnite and Minecraft, have hundreds of millions of users. Meanwhile, [in] the Web3 metaverses, the most popular one is Decentraland, and they're lucky if they have 2,000 users a week,"" she said.  Everyrealm initially focused on attracting metaverse real estate investors, but it now regards that category as only ""one tiny portion"" of its investment portfolio. Republic Realm, as Everyrealm was once known, purchased a virtual plot of real estate in the Ethereum-based game Decentraland at a price of more than $913,000 worth of the game's MANA cryptocurrency at the time.  The real value proposition, says Yorio, is to allow investors to deploy across platforms, wherever users happen to be.  ""Metaverse real estate gives the holder of real estate the ability to deploy content in another metaverse platform,"" Yorio said. The freedom to transfer the right to develop content to other people helps holders ""theoretically hold value.""  Previously working in private equity, real estate and hotel development, Yorio started Republic Realm before spinning it off into its own company. Considering metaverse as ""a very growing but early category,"" she said her fund is ""a more conservative way to approach an early industry with this one.""  According to MetaMetric Solutions, a metaverse analytics firm, real estate sales on four major metaverse platforms – Sandbox, Decentraland, Cryptovoxels and Somnium – reached $501 million in 2021. And it predicts those sales will double this year to nearly $1 billion.  Read more: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  ""It's very difficult to predict specific winners and specific companies that will succeed. Our company takes a broad diversified approach to the category,"" Yorio said.  The company has over 30 metaverse platform portfolio investments and holds more than 8,000 non-fungible tokens (NFT) and 100-plus metaverse real estate developments.  Yorio hopes to build spaces for communities where people don't just come one at a time,but come in groups, and share common interests and talk about things they have in common or to engage in activities in which all would want to be involved.  ""We want to continue to build this infrastructure layer and build a more valuable portfolio of investments and assets across the metaverse ecosystem,"" Yorio said.

The ""temporary urgent patch"" release will occur at around 08:00 UTC (12 p.m. ET) on Wednesday, Oct. 12, according to a post on GitHub Tuesday.  A hard fork is a change to a blockchain protocol that renders older versions invalid. It may be performed when a network makes fundamental changes to its mechanics or governance or, as in this case, as a means of fixing weaknesses that have resulted in hacks or exploits.  The BNB Chain, the blockchain closely linked to cryptocurrency exchange Binance, is composed of BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain (BSC).  Binance said deposits and withdrawals for the BSC network will be suspended starting an hour before the hard fork and will be re-started once the upgraded network is deemed to be stable.  BSC was afflicted by an exploit on Oct. 6 which drained around $100 million in crypto. BSC responded by shutting down the chain after spotting issues with the BSC Token Hub protocol, the clearinghouse for transactions moving between the network's composite parts. Operations were subsequently resumed on Oct. 7.

42421107,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZSjF,1665501359,Slicing the Elephant: Inside the Design of a Digital Euro,"Evelien Witlox is a busy woman.  When she’s not running between events – briefing European Union policymakers, banks or the Sibos finance conference this week – she’s designing the digital euro, a new format for the world’s second-biggest reserve currency.  As European Central Bank program manager for the central bank digital currency (CBDC), she has already set out exactly who would use it (initially people and governments, with intra-business and machine payments following later). Just two weeks ago, the ECB set out how its new form of money could work offline, safeguard privacy and prevent bank runs.  Those aren’t the last or most controversial topics on the agenda before the ECB’s senior executives make a decision, due in September, on whether to actually issue the thing. Witlox, previously an executive at Dutch bank ING, has an appropriate metaphor for such a mammoth task.  “We have sliced the elephant,” Witlox said in an interview with CoinDesk. “We have sliced this development of this design into many smaller decisions.”  The eurozone isn’t the only jurisdiction looking at a CBDC; Nigeria and the Bahamas have already deployed one, and around 100 jurisdictions in total are researching or developing. Yet, other major central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, don’t seem to be in a rush – not least because of the many design and policy issues a digital currency raises.  Rulebook  One of those issues, highlighted recently by ECB board member Fabio Panetta, is what kind of rules will apply to financial intermediaries – the banks and payment companies that would process digital euro transactions.  Witlox is now looking to hire a coordinator to draft that rulebook, according to an ECB statement made on Monday, after our interview.  Read more: Peer-to-Peer Validation for Digital Euro Might Not Be Feasible, ECB Says  Witlox told CoinDesk the rulebook could look like the direct debit messaging standards already used by many Europeans to pay household bills via bank transfer – allowing more flexibility in how the digital euro is used.  “The solution will be interoperable and standardized, so that it doesn't matter which intermediary you work with,” Witlox said.  That’s needed precisely because, as it stands – and much to the ECB’s chagrin – there’s currently no single European bank or payment system that operates across the euro area. But there’s plenty more decisions that will follow, and not all are going to be straightforward for lawmakers and the finance industry to agree on, Witlox said.  Blockchain or not?  The supposedly technocratic selection of U.S. web giant Amazon to aid with ecommerce prototypes for a digital euro has already led to political backlash. Other squabbles seem likely to follow over thorny topics such as how intermediaries will be compensated, or how to protect peoples’ privacy.  Plus the ECB must decide what technology it’s going to use for the CBDC – and, crucially, whether it will adopt Web3 innovations like decentralized ledgers and blockchain technology.  Witlox, no starry-eyed blockchain evangelist, isn’t in a rush to make that call.  Read more: EU Lawmakers Attack Amazon’s Involvement in Digital Euro Project  “The focus now is on the functionality,” she said. “The decision on which technology to use will only be taken later when it has become clear which technology is best suited.”  Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) have decisions validated by consensus without any central entity. Panetta has already said he wants to keep “full control” over issuance and settlement, suggesting the ECB won’t be following that model. The C stands for Central, after all.  But Witlox said she’s still looking to work with a decentralized technical infrastructure, in part to mitigate concerns that a single data store would prove an attractive honeypot for hackers.  “Obviously we need to keep track of our ledger,” she said – just as a bank would do, or a regular person managing a household budget. “But this would not exclude the usage of [distributed ledger] technologies.”  It’s still possible that, even after making so much fuss, the ECB will decide to abandon its project. Witlox said the final decision will rest on a cool-headed weighing of pros and cons – testing whether the putative CBDC meets the objectives set out in July, such as fostering innovation and boosting efficiency.  Read more: Europe's CBDC Designers Wrestle With Privacy Issues  And then will come the final challenge for the digital euro: whether people actually use it in daily life. Even without using cash, European shoppers have a range of options available to them – they can pay via contactless cards, mobile wallets and QR-code scans – and, Witlox said, the digital euro will complement those payment means, not replace them.  The ultimate question is whether anyone would bother, amid such an embarrassment of riches, to use the ECB-backed system – and it’s a question that is still hanging.  A report published Tuesday by the ECB shows that previous CBDC initiatives haven’t always been successful – and there’s no guarantee of success from using whizzy technology or fancy public information campaigns. Witlox is undeterred.  “It’s a safe asset to pay with, because it is a liability of the central bank,” Witlox said. “We will make sure that this is indeed a product that the end user would want to regularly use.”  Read more: New Global CBDC Platform Could Cut Payment Costs, IMF Says",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/11/slicing-the-elephant-inside-the-design-of-a-digital-euro,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b70720ea0258540a15da50b30150ca1b62a150fd-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422207,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0iexh,1665500692,A16z Leads $14M Funding Round for New E-Commerce Platform From Twitch Co-Founder,"The crypto arm of noted venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) led a $14 million funding round for Rye, a new e-commerce application programming interface (API) that lets merchants, stores and customers transact openly and with minimal fees. Rye plans for the API to eventually be fully decentralized on the Solana blockchain.  The funding will be used to build out the product and engineering teams and to start the decentralization process, according to the announcement blog post.  A16z crypto, which broke industry records with a new $4.5 billion fund in May, participated with the support of its Cultural Leadership Fund. Other investors in the round included Solana Ventures, GOAT Capital, L Catterton, Electric Ant, Electric Feel Ventures, Andre Iguodala, Javale McGee and James Beshara.  Rye came to life after the coronavirus pandemic drove a Cambrian explosion of new online shopping experiences, which in turn led to new types of e-commerce that were built on the go.  “After weeks of researching the market and talking to brands and sellers, my co-founders and I started to sketch together what the future of e-commerce should look like: an open and free network that could hold the collection of all products, where any brand can plug in their inventory, and any seller could pull from. This network should allow sellers to spin up an e-commerce experience in minutes, similar to how Stripe enabled payments in minutes,” wrote Rye co-founder and CEO Arjun Bhargava.  The Rye API includes an integrated one-click checkout, Amazon and Shopify product data, and connections to affiliate programs. The platform aims to benefit shoppers with a unified checkout experience that allows for shopping from multiple stores in one cart. The checkout will also include Web3 features, such as the ability to receive cash back rewards in the USDC stablecoin and purchase non-fungible token (NFT) releases.  The path to decentralization will involve Rye collaborating with merchants, sellers and developers. Rye has started by open sourcing the reference apps that use the API, such as the Rye store builder.  Rye’s team of founders includes former Reddit engineers Bhargava and Saurabh Sharma, Twitch co-founder Justin Kan, Scribd co-founder Tikhon Bernstam, Robin Chen (former head of Zynga China) and Jamie Quint, former head of growth at Notion.

42421106,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZSnN,1665500614,"‘No Central Points of Failure’: Sunny Aggarwal on ATOM 2.0, Mesh Networks and Cosmos’ Future","The Cosmos ecosystem is about to embark on a brave new journey, following the announcement of ATOM 2.0. The white paper, unveiled a few weeks back at a major Cosmos conference, is a radical redesign of the blockchain ecosystem’s value proposition. Or is it?  “The point of Cosmos is to be bigger than any one token, right? If Cosmos grows to be huge, and ATOM doesn't, that is completely fine,” Sunny Aggarwal, a longtime Cosmos developer and founder of Osmosis, the network’s largest app, said in an interview.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""I.D.E.A.S. Week."" Register here to become a part of the Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), a new conference focused on the innovations happening across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse.  Cosmos is a blockchain project conceived like almost any other, and it can be difficult to wrap your head around it. The central thesis is that we’re heading to a multichain world: That doesn’t just mean that Ethereum can be successful alongside competitors like Solana and Avalanche.  Cosmos is a foundational toolset that allows app developers to build bespoke chains and share network security. This is seen by dYdX’s recent decision to leave Ethereum to build its own native chain that’s part of Cosmos. Instead of being an app on Ethereum, it chose to attempt to capture value generated from users of the decentralized derivatives exchange on its native token and set of network validators.  Atom 2.0 has garnered a lot of buzz. In short, it’s an attempt to strengthen the ATOM chain and place it at the center of Cosmos – making it something like a reserve currency for the system. It changes the tokens issuance schedule, staking arrangement and makes the network-of-networks it supports, the Cosmos Hub, a center of multichain security.  Aggarwal thinks it’s a bold vision, but perhaps a step away from what Cosmos was meant to do. He presented his own model for interchain security using “mesh security” at Cosmosverse, the main Cosmos conference hosted this year in Colombia at the end of September.  Aggarwal thinks a better model for Cosmos’ future is one where each so-called “app-chain” runs their own sovereign state and contributes to a NATO-like defense of others.  Read more: Soft Money: Does a Crypto Network Exist Without a Community?  “The whole point of mesh network communication is that there's no central chain. There's no central point of failure,” he said. (He made the announcement on-stage wearing a 40-pound suit of chainmail armor, “lugged across two continents … for a one-line joke,” he reportedly said.)  As mentioned, Aggarwal is also the founder of Osmosis, a decentralized exchange that is expanding far beyond that role on Cosmos. His team also built Cosmos’ most-used wallet. Like most other people that believe in Cosmos’ multichain future, Aggarwal believes it’s users that make protocols valuable, not the infrastructure.  If crypto is compared to the 1990s internet boom, betting on more centralized chains like Ethereum would be like betting on AOL or Compuserve. While Cosmos, a network of blockchains specifically-built for applications, would be like betting on Google or Amazon, he said in a recent podcast.  CoinDesk caught up with Aggrawal to discuss his views on the ATOM 2.0 announcement, Cosmos’ value proposition and political map memes. A deep thinker, Aggarwal will be speaking at CoinDesk’s I.D.E.A.S. conference later this month.  Osmosis had a bug. What exactly went wrong, and how did you guys fix it?  Yeah, it was just like a non-deterministic bug introduced after an update. We write in Go [a programming language]; it gives us a lot of power and flexibility but it comes with a couple of things you have to be careful about. We just paused the chain, which was actually an automated process, and we got it back up and running within three or four hours. No real big issue, just, like, normal growing pains.  Is there a bigger lesson here?  This is going to get a little technical, but Go uses a data structure called “a map.” If you iterate over the map, the native Go version is non-deterministic by default, so you have to actively make them work with other applications. That's not the case with a lot of programming languages, like Rust. We actually introduced a new model of maps about six months ago that are automatically deterministic. The takeaway here is we gotta go through the entire Cosmos SDK and find every instance of the old version of map and replace it with the new one.  There was a huge upgrade announced for Cosmos recently. How does this change ATOM’s value proposition?  So there wasn't a Cosmos [version] 2 that was announced, it was an ATOM 2.0 – the two are separate but interrelated things. A lot of new stuff was announced at Cosmosverse. I gave a talk on something called mesh security, which is how we see the future of shared network security. Whether it's Polkadot with [its] parachains or rollups, everyone's building out this hub-and-spoke model of sharing security from one base system to everything else, and that's just not how we see the world working.  The whole point of mesh network communication is that there's no central chain. There's no central point of failure. All chains are equal in the Cosmos, right? So we don't want a system where the Cosmos Hub is the security provider for everything in Cosmos – that would defeat the whole point. The proposal we put forward, on the offensive side, is called national security. It's basically a way of every chain being a security provider and consumer.  I call it the NATO model, where you have a bunch of sovereign countries all sharing security with each other, but all remain sovereign and have their own governance systems and don’t meddle in each other's internal politics. But an attack on one is an attack on all. If something malicious happens on Osmosis, that validator will also get slashed on dYdX and stargaze and Juno.  See also: A Major Crypto Exchange Abandons Ethereum  It seems like the two models have a lot in common. Would you say that your Mesh Network and ATOM 2.0 are complementary?  I think they will inevitably coexist. I think the ATOM system is a subset of the Mesh security system. I like my geopolitics analogies: Atom’s hub model is like Switzerland. Switzerland, historically, was one of the most powerful militaries in the world but it was always very neutral. It had feared mercenaries. The hub could be a similar neutral, pay to play kind of thing.  ATOM’s model can be used to bootstrap new chains. If you don't have a validator set at all yet, you can launch without even having to think about that. Eventually they can spin off onto their own chain once they hit a certain stride. The model we really have in mind [for Mesh networks] – like, a lot of app chains have a medium level of security right now, and they all have their own validator sets – so if they band together to build a security system that could be stronger than any layer 1 [blockchain]. But both models are working towards the same end, and that goal shouldn’t mean that everything relies on ATOM for security.  You’ve compared blockchains to a political map before. What’s the general theory?  It was a play on the “political compass.” There's a vertical axis which is authoritarian to libertarian. And then from the left to right it represents “left wing” versus “right.” It's become a little bit of a meme, a way to place ideologies. I put network structures on the political compass. The top-left quadrant, which was colored red, was the authoritarian left system – sort of like this one hub and spoke, one central leader that connects to all the nodes. It’s more hierarchical than the authoritarian left, where all the nodes are equal except for one which is the authority. Then the libertarian left is a fully connected graph system. There’s no central authority at all. The libertarian right has no central authority, but some nodes are connected to more nodes.  It reminded me of an organic mesh network: All things are connected to the places they need to connect to. It’s organic because those power law dynamics tend to play out if you let systems run. There's naturally going to be power laws and hierarchy. Certain nodes are going to be more well-connected than others.  But the point is, unlike the authoritarian system, it's not a structural point of centrality. There’s still no one point of center system in the libertarian right. And that’s my personal whole worldview on everything I build on Cosmos. That bottom-right quadrant, the libertarian right system, those are the systems that scale. You need high-level communication to make things like “the web of trust” work. Libertarian left systems, fully connected systems, work really well as democracies. But they don't scale.  In light of this, do you think the ATOM 2.0 announcement was a little top-down? It seems like a significant shift of the token’s value proposition, without necessarily having earned the community’s vote.  I think a little bit of the ATOM 2.0 stuff came off as “a decision” rather than as a proposal. It's always important to share ideas early and fast. And they could have done a better job at being a little bit more transparent – but I do think that what they intended was for this to be more of a proposal and to get feedback and start a discussion.  Any lessons you took from the Ethereum Merge as all of this unfolds on Cosmos?  From the Ethereum Merge itself? I mean, not really. I mean, I'm really happy that they did a lot of testing and everything went off really smoothly. We did take quite a bit of some inspiration from this project called EigenLayr that’s being built as a kind of research layer for Eth 2.0. We're pretty close with Sreeram [Kannan]. And I think we definitely took some inspiration from the stuff they built as well.  Messari wrote that ATOM has underperformed relative to Cosmos’ role in crypto. Do you agree, or have an understanding of why that is?  I mean, look, I'll be completely honest – I don't work on ATOM. The point of Cosmos is to be bigger than any one token, right? If Cosmos grows to be huge and ATOM doesn't, that is completely fine. It’d even be a success story of the entire thesis ‘cause we're not dependent on any one token. If you look at the ATOM chain itself, what it’s actually … up until now it hasn't actually been providing much value. Realistically, Osmosis has been the biggest provider of value and use cases in the Cosmos ecosystem right now.  Great answer. Where does Osmosis’ success come from? I read it began to break out after building a bridge to Ethereum.  The bridge to Ethereum is built on a chain called Axelar, which we work very closely with but [it] actually connects the entire Cosmos ecosystem to Ethereum. What are the things that make Osmosis successful? At the end of the day, it really comes down to product and building the best product that people like to use. You can’t necessarily look at liquidity. Liquidity is fickle, it will move elsewhere. What matters the most is your relationships.  See also: 7 Trends That Could Reignite Crypto Growth  Flipside Crypto did an analysis, two months ago or something, where it looked at users onboarding into different blockchains in, like, January, and then their six-months retention rates on chains like Polygon, Solana, Osmosis and a couple others as well. And it actually saw that Cosmos had the highest six-month user retention rate. I think that just kind of shows our point, that building products people want to use brings demand for your system and creates real value.  January – wasn’t that before Terra [part of the Cosmos ecosystem] blew up?  That was before. The analysis was released, I believe, in June or July, so [Flipside was] looking at, like, six months prior to that.

42422199,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0ielh,1665500240,Crypto Exchange Bittrex to Pay $30M in US Treasury Sanctions Settlement,"Crypto exchange Bittrex settled charges alleging it inadvertently violated federal sanctions with the U.S. Treasury Department, agreeing to pay just under $30 million in fines and keep a closer eye on its compliance program.  The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the federal government’s sanctions enforcer, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), Treasury’s money laundering watchdog, announced the settlements on Tuesday. Alongside the monetary penalties, Bittrex has already taken remedial action to correct these issues, OFAC said.  Between 2014 and late 2017, Bittrex allowed around 1,800 people in sanctioned jurisdictions – including Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Syria and Crimea – to conduct more than 116,000 transactions worth roughly $260 million through its platform, according to the settlement. The Seattle, Washington-based exchange has since taken action to better comply with sanctions blacklists.  OFAC has a number of comprehensive sanctions actions, prohibiting U.S. persons – defined as anyone on U.S. soil and U.S. citizens located abroad – from interacting with or providing services to people in these jurisdictions.  Bittrex acknowledged years ago that it had allowed users from some sanctioned jurisdictions, such as Iran, to sign up for its platform. The exchange reached out to some of these customers in 2019 to offer to return their funds.  In a company statement, Bittrex said that it maintained anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance processes, and tapped unnamed third parties and service providers to assist it with verifying accounts and screen for sanctions compliance.  “As a growing company, during the period in question, we routinely assessed and improved these functions,” the statement said.  OFAC said there were a number of mitigating factors, including the fact that Bittrex was “a small and new company” at the time and the company “provided substantial cooperation” with OFAC’s investigation.  “In response to the Apparent Violations, Bittrex swiftly took a series of subsequent remedial measures that significantly curtailed the Apparent Violations,” OFAC said, including blocking the IP addresses tied to sanctioned jurisdictions, restricting sanctioned jurisdiction account holders and using new tools to improve compliance.  The maximum possible penalty for the OFAC allegations could have exceeded $35 billion, OFAC said, but given the various factors, the final fine is just over $24 million.  SARry  While OFAC focused on the alleged sanctions violations, the FinCEN settlement focused instead on suspicious activity reports (SAR) that the regulator alleges Bittrex failed to file during that same time period.  Bittrex “failed to file” SARs tied to 200 transactions moving more than $140,000 worth of cryptocurrency, and 22 transactions touching over $1 million, FinCEN said.  “Bittrex failed to implement effective transaction monitoring on its trading platform, relying on as few as two employees with minimal anti-money laundering training and experience to manually review all of the transactions for suspicious activity, which at times were over 20,000 per day,” FinCEN said.  FinCEN fined Bittrex $29.8 million, but said it would credit the exchange’s $24 million OFAC fine, meaning the company will only pay an overall total of just under $30 million.  In its statement, sent through a company attorney, Bittrex said it was “pleased” to have settled the charges.  “The settlement provides full resolution of both OFAC’s inquiry into transactions in sanctioned jurisdictions that occurred predominantly through 2017, and FinCEN’s assertion that Bittrex did not fully implement all of its Anti-Money Laundering Program controls through 2018,” the statement said. “... Importantly, both FinCEN and OFAC acknowledge that Bittrex’s longstanding responsive remedial efforts have significantly curtailed the risk of continued violations.”",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/11/crypto-exchange-bittrex-to-pay-30m-in-us-treasury-sanctions-settlement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60594cacaba008a6b7487d042995c68826183704-2080x1521.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Lightning Labs, the infrastructure firm behind the protocol, introduced an upgrade in April called Taro that supports the transfer of stablecoins and other assets. A test version of Taro was released late last month.  River Lightning Services aims to make it easier for companies to access the new multi-asset functionality. Developers can integrate Lightning payments into applications with an application programming interface (API) without having to run any of the Lightning infrastructure.  “The vision behind RLS is to unlock a new era of payments for the internet by making it extremely easy for developers to integrate Lightning Network payments into their apps,” Alex Leishman, Founder and CEO of River, told CoinDesk in an email.  “The Lightning Network will support stablecoins in the near future after the initial version of the upcoming Taro protocol is released,” Leishman continued. “This will mean instant, extremely cheap, bitcoin and [U.S. dollar] payments on Lightning and RLS will make this very easy for everybody to use. RLS is doing for Lightning what Stripe did for credit cards.”  River has nearly four years of experience running Lightning Network infrastructure.

Bit Digital (BTBT), a mining firm that hosts 17% of its machines at Blockfusion's site in Niagara Falls, received the notice just four days after a moratorium on the industry was lifted on Sept. 30, the firm said on Tuesday. The notice ordered Blockfusion to ""cease and desist from any cryptocurrency mining or related operations at the facility"" until it complies with city zoning laws.  The notice actually came into effect just a day after the moratorium was lifted. The hosting firm is applying for new permits, a process which might take months, Bit Digital cited Blockfusion as saying.  Neither Bit Digital nor the mayor's office could be reached for comment at the time of publication.  In December 2021, Niagara Falls implemented a moratorium on bitcoin mining so the city could figure out rules involving the industry. The state of New York passed a similar measure in June.  Residents are upset about noise coming from the bitcoin mines, especially one run by U.S. Bitcoin Corp., which is close to a residential area.  The Blockfusion site suffered from an explosion in May, such that Bit Digital's machines went offline. Power was restored to the site in September, said Bit Digital.

The Metis team notably includes Natalia Ameline, the mother of Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin.  A growing industry of rollup technologies seeks to address Ethereum’s key scalability issues of slow throughput and high transaction or gas fees. Rollups bundle a large number of transactions off the main blockchain and then return the bundle to Ethereum for recording. There are two types of rollups: Zero-Knowledge, which uses computer algorithms to verify transactions, and Optimistic, which optimistically trust that the transactions are valid. People watching an optimistic network have a week to challenge a potentially fraudulent transaction, and the rollup then runs a fraud proof to verify that transaction.  Read more: What Are Rollups? ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups Explained  Metis’ new Smart L2 Optimistic Rollup aims to streamline the recording process of the bundles to make it easier for validators and proofs to find, challenge and approve transactions.  “Creating Smart L2 was prompted by the business requirements of having fast and cheap transactions, because the transactions on Arbitrum and other layer 2s were not scalable enough for business needs,” Metis co-founder Elena Sinelnikova told CoinDesk in an interview. “We modernized the classic optimistic rollup to save the record to the layer 1 on demand.”  Smart L2 still bundles and processes Ethereum transactions off-chain before returning them for recording and verification. However, the transaction data is stored off of both the layer 1 and layer 2 by using decentralized cloud storage service MEMO Labs. The address and transaction data is Merklized and stored on the base Ethereum blockchain for retrieval and verification later, saving space and making it faster for validators and fraud proofs to find and verify transactions. Metis has a fail-safe in place should MEMO Labs become unavailable for any reason, Sinelnikova said.  Metis said Smart L2 can reduce Ethereum user gas fees from the typical $2 to $3 dollars per transaction down to between 2 cents and 14 cents per transaction, according to the press release.  Natalia Ameline leads Metis’ $100 million Genesi DAO ecosystem fund. She and Sinelnikova also co-founded CryptoChicks, a nonprofit that supports women in the blockchain industry.  Metis developers are currently working on an option where businesses can opt for Zero-Knowledge proving of transactions, allowing for faster validation and user withdrawals. The team is also developing a way to incentivize validators for faster verifications to shorten the withdrawal window for Optimistic rollups.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SPONSORED | ARB,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/11/new-metis-rollup-tech-addressees-ethereum-scalability-for-businesses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b326549c7d40bd18607634e7f5a0a91d34e4abe2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42435025,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGnlOH,1665489600,Smart-Contract Platform Soroban Receives $100M to Build on Stellar Network,"Native smart-contract platform Soroban has launched on the Stellar network with the support of a $100 million fund, it said Tuesday.  The Soroban Adoption Fund allocates $100 million from the Stellar Development Foundation to developers building tools and products for the Soroban ecosystem through incentive programs like Sorobanathon: First Light, which rewards developers for testing Soroban and sharing feedback, code examples and tutorials. The incentive program hopes to help the platform make strides toward offering more cost-efficient smart contracts with lower-than-average, consistently priced gas fees.  Tomer Weller, vice-president of tech strategy at the Stellar Development Foundation, says the platform plans to offer smart contract fees that are lower than those of their competitors by simplifying transactions and utilizing comparatively lower levels of computing power to process them.  “We've really optimized the contracts to a point where you don't need to constantly serialize and deserialize information, which is something a lot of [computing power] is wasted on,” Weller told CoinDesk.  The platform’s inventors have also created a fee model designed to offer consistent fee pricing based on the amount of computing power that's used to process a transaction.  “We built a fee model that you can calibrate, because [in] other ecosystems the fees don't necessarily reflect the amount of computing power a lot of times,” said Weller. “So sometimes you have two contracts that cost the same. but one of them is actually much more expensive to compute.”  Soroban, which is now live on Futurenet, has put out a call for developers to tinker with its smart contract service, which is written in Rust. Although the platform will go through several test nets before launching in early 2023, it has already been designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind, Weller says.  “Our development environment is really batteries included, which means you have this local sandbox that's easy to set up on your computer, '' said Weller. “We have these basically built-in contracts and built-in host functionality so that you don't need to reinvent the wheel.”  The Stellar Network, which was founded in 2014, has processed 2 billion operations since its inception. In its early years, the platform focused on cross-border payment initiatives.  The Stellar Network counts around 7.2 million users among its active user base and roughly $3.4 billion worth of its native Stellar (XLM) tokens are in circulation.

42435027,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGnlQj,1665489600,"Block Subsidiary Spiral, Mining Tech Firm Braiins Spearhead Push for Bitcoin Mining Upgrades","Block (SQ) subsidiary Spiral and bitcoin mining tech provider Braiins are spearheading a working group to promote the adoption of updates to the bitcoin mining pool protocol.  The upgrade is the second version of the Stratum protocol, which is used by most miners to control how mining machines connect to pool servers. Bitcoin mining pools aggregate the hashrates of many miners and distribute rewards across the participants.  Stratum's second version (V2) promises several improvements on the protocol, including censorship resistance and allowing miners to choose their own work, instead of being assigned workloads by pools, which in turn could increase the Bitcoin network's decentralization.  Braiins, which is the firm behind the world's first mining pool, formerly known as Slush Pool, released the first version of Stratum in 2012 and V2 in 2019. Braiins itself implemented V2 in early 2020, but adoption through the rest of the industry has been sluggish.  The working group will focus on ""building and sharing tools for all mining companies to quickly and seamlessly upgrade"" to Stratum V2, the companies said in a Tuesday press release.  Crypto financial services firm Galaxy Digital, crypto mining and staking firm Foundry, crypto exchange BitMEX and bitcoin education program Summer of Bitcoin, support some of Stratum V2's key developers, who are in turn part of the working group. Spiral and Braiins invited interested parties to participate in the group in their press release. Foundry is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.  Miners ""know the benefits of Stratum V2 very well,"" but pushing the mining industry over the ""remaining development and adoption hurdles"" is a ""big task,"" said Braiins co-founder Jan Capek in the press release.  Implementation  The working group released the first version of an open-source Stratum V2 reference implementation (SRI) for testing, according to the press release. Reference implementations in software development are usually done by the developers of a product to showcase how it can be put to use. Other firms can either implement that code, or use it as inspiration for their own implementation.  SRI is meant ""to test the interoperability of all implementations,"" Braiins Chief Marketing Officer Kristian Csepcsar told CoinDesk.  A new ""more robust"" version of the SRI with more functionality will be released in early November, the press release said.  ""Universal standards for running and building Stratum V2 and the efforts of this working group to push the industry forward will provide the momentum Bitcoin needs to finally upgrade from a version of its mining protocol that was built a decade ago,” Capek said.  Spiral, under Jack Dorsey's Block, which has pledged to make mining more decentralized, supports three developers of Stratum V2 – Matt Corallo, Fi3 and Pavlenex. Other core contributors are Rachel Rybarczyk of Galaxy Digital; 4ss0, who is a pseudonymous developer financed by Foundry; Chris Coverdale, an independent developer financed by BitMEX; and Lorenzo Bonazzi of Summer of Bitcoin, according to the press release.

42411341,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNEPx,1665488772,The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin Culture,"Bitcoin maximalism has become so desperately unhinged I consider it a cultural Chernobyl. The situation was not always so. Bitcoin culture was not maximalist for most of its history.  The zealots infecting modern Bitcoin culture are usurpers.  I arrived into the world of Bitcoin in 2012. I had heard about the dark net marketplace Silk Road and its then-elusive leader, the Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR). As a fan of subcultures, I was enthralled and I still think nothing has come close to that era for sheer intrigue.  Paul Dylan-Ennis, a CoinDesk columnist, is a lecturer/assistant professor in the College of Business, University College Dublin.  Silk Road led me to look into Bitcoin, which led me to look into cypherpunks and libertarianism, terms I had never heard before. The experience was formative because I did not just become a bitcoiner, but I changed my entire academic research trajectory to Bitcoin. It was a calculated risk that paid off career-wise.  I spent the next few years completely immersed in the bitcointalk forums. For most of Bitcoin’s early history bitcointalk was Bitcoin and it was amazing. What struck me at the time was how individual everyone was. Most people there held very unique positions and had varied interests. They were rarely on the same page about anything, including Bitcoin! They did not repeat generic talking points or simplistic memes.  This does not mean the users on bitcointalk were nice. Discussions were often mean-spirited, but debates were well-informed and not cliche. You could, as shocking as this may sound in the current atmosphere, actually learn new things there.  At the time, my research specialization was just bitcoin because that was the only crypto people in academia recognized. (except “blockchain,” which I sidestepped artfully!). I was forced to understand bitcoin intimately, in all its layers: technical, social, economic.  I remember nyms like theymos, MemoryDealers and MagicalTux. I know what RIPEMD160 is. What stratum is for. Or what F2pool is. I know what BitcoinXT was. I know not to confuse my UASF with USAF. The lore is in my very bones.  See also: Nic Carter vs. The Bitcoin Maximalists | Opinion  Yet, I was never a bitcoin maximalist. Back then, people who didn’t like altcoins just ignored them. There was never any suggestion that holding other coins was verboten. Satoshi himself was happy to work with Namecoin. There was no culturally monolithic embargo on altcoins like today. There was no purity test to pass.  'Stay toxic'  The term maximalism was coined in 2014 by maximalism’s favourite villain, Vitalik Buterin:  One of the latest ideas that has come to recently achieve some prominence in parts of the Bitcoin community is the line of thinking that has been described by both myself and others as “Bitcoin dominance maximalism” or just “Bitcoin maximalism” for short - essentially, the idea that an environment of multiple competing cryptocurrencies is undesirable, that it is wrong to launch “yet another coin,” and that it is both righteous and inevitable that the Bitcoin currency comes to take a monopoly position in the cryptocurrency scene.  The term is interpreted widely differently depending on what community you belong to.  If you are a bitcoiner then, as Pete Rizzo informs us, it likely means you believe one or all of the following:  Bitcoin, a computer science invention, is the world's first working non-state monetary system. All other crypto assets compete with bitcoin by virtue of their existence, none offer long-term advantages without trade-offs.  Investing in other cryptocurrencies is [select one: wrong, stupid, immoral, uninteresting] and should be discouraged and ignored socially for the benefit of others as a form of consumer protection.  Bitcoin is only limited by human ingenuity. Anything other cryptocurrencies can do can otherwise be achieved by either bitcoin (or a centralized financial alternative).  If you are belong to the crypto community – which Bitcoin increasingly defines itself against – then, as CoinDesk's Daniel Kuhn tell us, it’s a pejorative that is:  …meant to evoke a certain closed-mindedness or lack of imagination in the Bitcoin community. Sometimes it suggests that “maxis” are only out to maximize their profits.  I would say the correct definition lies somewhere in the middle. Maximalism is when you believe Rizzo’s (1), (2) and (3), but you do so in the close-minded, highly aggressive manner captured in Kuhn’s definition.  Some bitcoiners, like Rizzo, believe bitcoin has a unique status among cryptocurrencies after carefully weighing the evidence. But this is not often the type of maxi you're more likely to encounter. No, we encounter an endless onslaught of triumphalist, populist meme lords hellbent on portraying every good faith crypto endeavor as if Sauron himself designed it.  How did we get here and can we escape maximalism?  Let me be absolutely clear where I stand: Maximalism is extremely detrimental to crypto, turning it into an endless grind of factionalism. This factionalism is intrinsically self-destructive because it is unappealing to the mainstream, manifesting as aggression, hostility and toxicity.  More and more the average Crypto Joe has learned these traits originate in bitcoin culture. What is bitcoin culture to them? It’s laser eyes, have-fun-staying-poor, oddball Citadel stuff and Adam Back saying “stay toxic.” What kind of insane culture embraces toxicity!  See also: I Don't Understand Bitcoin Maximalism | Opinion  The seasoned Crypto Joe knows what to expect and that’s the answer to why nobody wants bitcoiners at their conferences. Why would any other culture want to be berated by a bitcoiner at an event? If bitcoin wants respect it can start first by giving respect to others.  Give a little bit  Let’s turn to the how. I want to stress to the newcomers, especially the infamous “joined 2021” generation, that maximalism is not a bitcoin norm. It’s a recent curio and it can be excised by any robust bitcoin cultural alternative willing to take on the battle.  I trace the origin of today's maximalism back to the Bitcoin Civil War. As we’ve seen, the term originates in 2014, but truly takes off after following a contentious debate about blocksize and scaling solutions that led to the Bitcoin Cash hard fork in 2017. A particular vision for Bitcoin won out – favoring smaller blocks, SegWit implementation and scaling through the Lightning Network.  Instead of Bitcoin primarily as digital cash with some gold-like properties, as envisioned by Roger Ver, Bitcoin would be primarily digital gold at the base layer, but with a dedicated layer 2 for cash-like payments.  The victory, in technical terms, was clear-cut and clean. The Mowist small blockers saved Bitcoin from an attack by the miners, primarily through the UASF counter-tactic, but also, and this is important for what followed, by adopting relatively sophisticated public relations tactics.  Here’s how the infamous “Dragon’s Den” coordinated its social layer - /bitcoin, bitcointalk, Twitter - as described in ""The Blocksize War"":  The channel was very active and entirely focused on the blocksize war. Most of the conversion revolved around social media, public relations and how best to expose weaknesses in the narratives and arguments put forward by the large blockers. Many participants in the channel appeared very committed to the cause. Discussion often focused around how to convince various people to join the small block camp, who was likely to turn, and which would be the most effective issues to focus on in social media. There was also discussion on memes and meme production. This war was also a meme war, and the “Dragons”, as members of the channel were sometimes called, were very involved in meme production. Many of these memes were humorous, designed to make the large blockers appear as if they had a weak understanding of some of the technical issues in Bitcoin, with Roger Ver, Craig Wright and Jihan Wu being the main focus of attention.  In hindsight, the Dragon’s Den set the stage for maximalism’s emphasis on adversarial thinking - it is Bitcoin against everyone - where attack is the best defence. You need only look at how a Bitcoin maximalist comes armed with a set of derivative pre-packaged talking points about, say, Ethereum, to see the contemporary version of this preemptive narrative formation. There’s little to no reflection on Ethereum per se, but there is a deep well of sanctioned generic Ethereum memes that are mindlessly trotted out. As someone who researches both Bitcoin and Ethereum, the degree to which the modern bitcoiner does not understand Ethereum is often shocking, although perhaps the solace of maximalism is you can just learn Bitcoin and never anything else. Relaxing!  Maximalism consolidated by firming up the expectations on its own members. Most radical subcultures begin by expressing their ire outward, as maximalists do to crypto, but they concretize around the expected behaviors of its own community members. Acceptable maximalist behavior operates in an interestingly puritanical manner because it is all about foregoing now to benefit later, which can mean “hodling,” but, more importantly resisting temptation, like decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible tokens (NFT).  Bitcoin maximalist cultural logic is restrictive. It is about who can behave in the purist, most ascetic manner. The problem for members, as it is in most puritanical cultures, is this is a double-edged sword. You can enjoy berating crypto degens for their excess, but you may find the laws weaponized against yourself, for infractions that are a moving target, one day investing in crypto ventures is acceptable, the next you are Nic Carter and out in the cold. It is not incidental that the most prominent critics of Bitcoin maximalism, like Udi or Arthur Hayes, push back hard against the restriction on other coins; they recognize the absurd quasi-religious undertones involved.  Purity is an accelerant. The most moral, the most pure, the most serious is invariably the new convert. When you get into a tangle with a Bitcoin maximalist on Twitter today, an occupational hazard, you will soon encounter the phenomenon known as “Joined 2021.” This user does not debate, they meme. Specifically, they meme with an aesthetic best described as Boomer Uncle on Meta. “Uncle Bitcoin” is entirely predictable:  Bitcoin only  Wanting Ethereum to be a security more than the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  QAnon-style conspiracies about Joseph Lubin and ConsenSys  Uses outdated terms like ICOs, altcoins – revealing they are trapped in a 2017 time warp  Hyperbitcoinization is inevitable even though nobody knows how a Bitcoin-based deflationary economy would work in practice  Proof-of-work is the only viable consensus mechanism, for all possible use cases, until the Heat Death of the Universe  Some kind of [Michael] Saylor-inspired esoteric Bitcoin metaphysics  And that’s the stuff that is at least contextually coherent. You already know Uncle Bitcoin only eats steak. Push a little more and Uncle Bitcoin will treat you to some Fedora-tipping manosphere energy and before you know it goddamn Jordan Peterson is speaking at Bitcoin Miami. Uncle Bitcoin’s talking points ultimately flow downstream from a small cadre of Bitcoin influencers who produce more misinformation than a Russian bot farm. Their irresponsibly misleading tweets are the pinnacle of Brandolini’s law. Where would one even start the fantastical idea that Bitcoin has 40 million transactions per second? Or how do you respond to a tweet comparing proof-of-stake to slavery?  What’s the solution to “The Weirdening” of Bitcoin? We could grant Bitcoin maximalism its wish and separate Bitcoin from crypto. I know this amounts to their secession from crypto and we should oppose it on principle, but it’s what they want. They’re Texas (in analogy and spirit) and let Texas be Texas. This could be symbolized by removing bitcoin from CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. This immediately would move ether to the top position it has been enviably eyeing up since its inception. Everyone would be happy!  Yet, I think this would be a depressing outcome. Bitcoin’s original culture was a synthesis of determined cypherpunk and thoughtful libertarianism. It drew on previous movements, certainly, but this combination was completely ex nihilo, a once in a generation cultural event. It set down the core principles of crypto culture: decentralization and censorship resistance. These remain our red lines. And bitcoin remains the gold standard in both cases.  See also: After Bitcoin Maximalism | Podcast  I do not want to leave the impression that this is simply a critique of bitcoin. My words are directed squarely at the triumphalist nihilism of Bitcoin maximalism. I want to emphasize that cultures ebb and flow. We do not have to be fatalistic about the stranglehold maximalists have. But it will be hard work to push back. You can probably already imagine the blowback I will receive from them for this article. And any bitcoiner challenging them will face the same toxicity. But it has to be done.  To encourage the pushback, I propose another path, one where bitcoin is positively affiliated with the rest of crypto. Crypto is a vast design space of cryptoeconomic experimentation emanating from the Genesis Block and those operating in the emerging fields of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), DeFi and NFTs are exploring it. Now, imagine a bitcoin culture that rather than aggressively berating the rest of crypto, used its considerable experience and know-how to positively encourage decentralization and censorship resistance, taking up a paternal (rather than paternalistic) role befitting bitcoin’s history. Instead of focusing on the scams and casino capitalism that blight crypto – and once blighted bitcoin when it was the only game in town – bitcoiners could help build the full suite of decentralized organization, finance and creativity that a post-centralized society will need.

42435019,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGnlMR,1665487288,Brokerage Firm Bernstein Says NFTs Are Not Dead,"The business of non-fungible-tokens (NFT) is getting serious. While they may have started out looking like speculative jpeg images, they are now redefining the “crypto consumer stack” in terms of games, social, content and commerce, brokerage and research firm Bernstein said in a research report Monday.  The early success and subsequent decline of NFT activity has multiple lessons, but the sector is still in the early stages of adoption, and NFTs are “how crypto would go mainstream and onboard users,” the report said.  NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items and can be sold or traded.  “NFTS are not dead,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote, noting that well-known collections such as the Bored Ape are still holding a floor price of $100,000, and the number of active monthly users on OpenSea is stable at about 360,000, down about 35% from a high of around 550,000.  The real part of the “NFT revolution” is using these tokens as “Lego blocks” to build a fun game, the note said, adding that while crypto games are no competition to the mainstream gaming studios, it is possible to build a new genre of NFT-powered games in which players can earn and own in-game assets such as NFTs.  “Brands leverage NFTs to sell digital goods for real-life experiences,” Bernstein said. As the crypto consumer base expands, every brand will need to build a NFT marketing strategy, it added, noting that Nike (NKE) already has about $180 million revenue through NFTs.  The success of NFTs will now depend on their ability to deliver a real product, such as gaming worlds, content and merchandise, the note said, adding that blockchain games should not try to compete with the large gaming studios, but innovate on game play that is unique to crypto.  The NFT infrastructure stack will continue to see significant private investment, the note added.

In its preliminary financial and operating results for the quarter, Greenidge reported expected revenue of around $29 million compared to $35.8 million for the corresponding quarter a year ago.  The mining firm also announced the appointment of David Anderson as its new CEO following the departure of Jeffrey Kirt effective Oct. 7. Anderson was most recently president and CEO of Millar Western Forest Products, an Alberta, Canada-based integrated forest products company.  Greenidge mined approximately 866 BTC during Q3 compared to 729 BTC during the same period last year.  GREE shares sunk around 24% Monday closing at $1.32. In pre-market trading today, shares are currently up 5.3% at $1.39.  The Bitcoin network's mining difficulty has surged according to the latest data, which shows it now requires 35.6 trillion hashes to mine one BTC, an increase of 13.55% compared to its previous measure.  This means it is costing miners larger sums to extract new bitcoin at a time when the value of the world's largest crypto is treading water and high energy prices are adding to their costs.  Greenidge's preliminary results follow London-listed bitcoin miner Argo Blockchain (ARBK) being forced to raise $27 million last week to ease liquidity pressures and mining data center provider Compute North filing for bankruptcy.

On-chain data from analytics platform Nansen identifies wallets belonging to Mashinsky showing a steady stream of Celsius' CEL token and Circle's USDC stablecoin leaving his six wallets over the last month.  Coffezilla, a blockchain sleuth that exposes crypto scams on YouTube, claims to have spotted another wallet controlled by Mashinsky that has moved approximately $225,376 in CEL and USDC during the last month. Ownership of this wallet has not been confirmed by Nansen, however on-chain data shows that it has been funded by a confirmed Mashinsky wallet.  This is in addition to the $28,242 moved by Mashinsky in August over the course of a few days, as CoinDesk has previously reported, and the nearly $27 million that was withdrawn by executives in two tranches before the firm declared bankruptcy.  Mashinsky did not respond to a request for comment by CoinDesk by press time.  According to on-chain data, Mashinsky’s collection of wallets still contains $197,301 worth of crypto, primarily comprised of CEL and USDC.  When will Celsius reopen custody Wwthdrawals?  Given its heavy exposure to beleaguered crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, Celsius faced financial difficulties during the summer’s broader market downturn and froze withdrawals in June before filing for bankruptcy protection on July 13.  The question on the minds of its users – especially as Mashinsky and other executives cash out – no doubt is about withdrawals.  But they might be waiting a bit longer.  Earlier this month, the trustee tasked with overseeing the company’s bankruptcy called a motion to reopen withdrawals “premature.”  “At this juncture, there are too many questions regarding the debtors’ cryptocurrency holdings to approve any withdrawals or sales,” attorneys for the Trustee’s office wrote in the objection. “Those questions arise both from the debtors’ lack of transparency … [and] the Debtors’ failure to file schedules and statements of financial affairs.”  Read more: Sky-High Yields and Bright Red Flags: How Alex Mashinsky Went From Bashing Banks to Bankrupting Celsius  Late last week, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn, who is overseeing the case, ordered an independent examiner to produce a report by mid-November detailing Celsius’ financial management and handling of customer accounts.

While bitcoin&apos;s price has been suspiciously flat for a while, the difficulty adjustment came in and registered an all-time high. Do the miners know something we don&apos;t? Or is there a transfer of power going on behind the scenes? Glassnode poses a working theory on their latest The Week On-Chain. To begin with, Glassnode puts the difficulty adjustment into perspective: &apos;Bitcoin hashrate has reached a new all-time-high of 242 Exahash per second.

42435034,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGnlV1,1665482536,Bitcoin's Calm Amid Soaring Bond Market Volatility Points to 'HODLer'-Dominated Crypto Market,"Since the early days, cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC), have been criticized for being too volatile relative to traditional markets and unreliable as a medium of exchange or a store of value.  However, recently bitcoin, the so-called risk asset, has held remarkably steady amid heightened volatility in nearly every traditional market asset, including U.S. government bonds, which are widely regarded as the safest, according to a paper published in the American Economic Review.  With prices stuck between $18,000 to $25,000 since early July, bitcoin's annualized 90-day realized, or historical, volatility has crashed from 80% to a 21-month low of 21%, according to data sourced from charting platform TradingView. The cryptocurrency's 90-day implied volatility, or expectations for price turbulence over three months has dropped to a four-month low of 63.7%, according to data tracking platform Laevitas.  Meanwhile, with the Federal Reserve hell-bent on raising interest rates to control inflation, the ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. bond market options volatility index jumped to 160 last week, the highest since the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020.  One explanation for bitcoin's relative calm is that most macro traders sensitive to the Fed policy and traditional market volatility left the crypto market early this year. And the crypto market is now dominated by ""HODLers"" – investors intending to hold BTC for the long term in hopes that the cryptocurrency will eventually evolve as digital gold and a medium of exchange.  ""The more short-term macro investors exit the crypto market, the more pricing power they cede to longer-term participants with possibly different investment theses,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, wrote to subscribers on Oct. 4.  Macro traders build a portfolio of multiple assets after assessing central bank and government policies and country-level economic data.  According to Acheson, macro traders swarmed the crypto market after major central banks, including the Fed, opened liquidity floodgates following the March 2020 crash.  ""They did not really care about the seizure and censorship resistance, they wanted the upside potential, and because crypto assets were treated as high-risk vehicles, they started to behave as such,"" Acheson noted.  And because these entities did not believe in bitcoin's stated objectives, they probably exited the market in the early stages of the Fed's liquidity tightening.  The Fed kicked off its rate hike cycle in March. Bitcoin nosedived 56% in the second quarter and Wall Street's benchmark equity index S&P 500 fell by 16%.  The 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and the S&P 500 increased from 0.5 to 0.94 in the second quarter, perhaps a sign of macro traders divesting crypto holdings amid risk aversion in the equity market. The 90-day correlation dipped to 0.44 last month and stood near 0.7 at press time, still elevated but well below the second-quarter high of 0.94.  Acheson added that the recent uptick in correlation does not necessarily mean macro traders are dominating the crypto market again, as ""virtually all assets continue to be buffeted by macro and monetary uncertainty.""  That's evident from the absence of large inflows and outflows from exchange-traded funds and exchange-traded products listed across Europe, the U.S. and Canada.  And if that's not enough, on-chain data shows a continued accumulation, probably by long-term investors. Macro traders and institutions typically prefer to take exposure to bitcoin via alternative investment vehicles like ETFs and regulated cash-settled futures.  ""Meanwhile, accumulation has continued. The percentage of BTC that has not moved in over a year is now at the all-time high of over 65%,"" Acheson wrote.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/11/bitcoins-calm-amid-soaring-bond-market-volatility-points-to-hodler-dominated-crypto-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3cdc8240d5b0825bc1caf8e50943bbef9450d932-2601x1144.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin's Late Dip Doesn't Shake It From Its $19K Perch  by James Rubin  Bitcoin continued its recent sedentary lifestyle on Monday, and the trend seems likely to continue, at least until the next inflation report later this week.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization spent much of the day trading sideways before a late dip took it down roughly 2% over the past 24 hours and recently trading at $19,050. BTC has held steady between $19,000 and $19,500 for much of the past four days as investors wait for convincing evidence that inflation is slowing meaningfully – or not.  This Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) is widely expected to show a slight decrease from last month's 8.3 reading, hardly enough to sway current U.S. central bank, monetary hawkishness and allay fears of a harsh recession. Both events would hurt riskier assets, including crypto.  ""I suspect that inflation will remain quite high,"" Octavio Marenzi, CEO and founder of management consultancy Opimas, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover ""program.  He added: ""That is going to tie the Fed's hands. They are going to have to carry on increasing interest rates, which is going to weigh down crypto markets. So on Thursday, we're not going to see much good news for crypto markets.""  Ether was recently trading just under $1,300, a more than 3% drop from Sunday, same time. Other major altcoins were solidly in the red after a late afternoon dip with CHZ and ETC recently off more than 13% and 10%, respectively, and SUSHI and the popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB both down over 8%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, was recently down about 0.1%.  Stocks  Equity markets continued their now four-day streak of woe with the tech-focused Nasdaq declining 1% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropping a few fractions of a percentage point. The Nasdaq, which plunged into bear market territory months ago, meaning it fell at least 20% from its previous high, reached a 15-month low, according to Dow Jones Market data.  Treasury yields, which have followed an inverse course to cryptos, rose. Brent crude oil, a measure of energy markets, was recently trading at about $96 per barrel, roughly flat, despite the latest rumblings from Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine – a Russian missile barrage on Kyiv and other major cities. The conflict continues to figure heavily in global, macroeconomic uncertainty. Concerns about Chinese consumer spending and U.S. cuts in semiconductor exports to the country offered additional, unsettling news Monday.  Meanwhile, crypto news was mixed. As CoinDesk reported, a record number of Brazilian companies purchased crypto in August. But in an interview with CNBC Monday, legendary hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones retreated from his previous bitcoin bullishness. Jones said that he had ""a minor allocation to bitcoin"" little more than two years after saying he had committed 1% to 2% of his multi-billion portfolio to the digital asset.  Jones compared troubling inflation to ""toothpaste.""  ""Once you get it out of the tube, it’s hard to get it back in."" The Fed, he said, ""is furiously trying to wash that taste out of [its] mouth ... If we go into recession, that has really negative consequences for a variety of assets.""

By Sam Reynolds  NFTs aren’t exactly the blue-chip investment their supporters hoped them to be.  But did YouTube star Logan Paul really watch his $623,000 investment in a bumblebee-styled non-fungible token called K4M-1 #03 evaporate to $10 as claimed?  Paul certainly lost a lot of money, but not nearly as much as it seemed.  Read More: First Mover Asia: DappRadar’s Complicated Valuation Model and the Difficulties of Assessing NFTs  According to DappRadar, Paul’s NFT is worth around $7,272, or 5.51 ether (ETH). The valuation underscores the subjective nature of NFT pricing, even in the current down market.  DappRadar’s NFT estimates can be controversial. NFT Twitter got angry about its valuation of Three Arrows Capital’s Starry Night wallet. But there’s not really a universal way to value NFTs, and in the end DappRadar’s valuation turned out to be higher than Nansen's.  ""Our algorithm calculates what is the price of an NFT, which is consistent with the historical sales data. It is not precisely predicting, but finding a price that makes sense for the current market conditions. This methodology allows the investor to evaluate how good the trade price is, while also assessing the importance of the sale within the collection’s market,"" a DappRadar spokesperson told CoinDesk earlier via email.  Overall, DappRadar puts Paul’s NFT collection at just under $1 million.  Read more: First Mover Asia: There's No Universally Accepted Way to Value Three Arrows' NFTs  In December 2021, Paul tweeted that he had spent $2.645 million assembling his NFT collection. Now, it's worth about 37% of what he paid for it. While most of the NFTs in the collection have had double-digit losses, there are also some double-digit gains.  Nansen puts the wallet’s value at 394 ETH, or approximately $515,000.  Either way, Paul seems to be a shrewder NFT investor than Three Arrows Capital, which saw its Starry Night portfolio fall to 0.04% of what was paid for it.

42435018,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGnlLp,1665448735,‘Fear’ May Be Keeping Ooki DAO From Mounting Defense Against CFTC,"Ooki DAO, the first decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) dragged to court over alleged lawbreaking in the U.S., is struggling to muster a response to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with just days to go before it risks automatically losing its case.  Fear that simply expressing their views could fuel a further legal crackdown may be keeping community members from voting to fund their own legal defense, community members and an observer told CoinDesk. The result: a decentralized crypto governance group whose members are skittish about defending themselves using the tools of crypto governance.  The investor collective’s members (Ooki DAO token owners) are accused of illegally running Ooki Protocol as an unregistered leveraged crypto exchange that does not collect customer data. Ooki is the decentralized successor to bZeroX, LLC, an equivalent centralized exchange whose founders have already settled their equivalent charges with the CFTC.  The CFTC is now trying to hold Ooki’s decentralized management – its DAO token holders – accountable for the platform’s alleged wrongdoing. In late September, it filed a complaint against Ooki token owners who have participated in governing the Ooki Protocol by using their tokens to vote in the DAO.  According to the fluid philosophies of decentralized crypto governance such a lawsuit shouldn’t be possible. When bZeroX’s founders gave Ooki DAO control of their platform in August 2021, they thought that community governance would “future-proof” the protocol from regulators, who wouldn't know who to sue. The CFTC disagreed and sued the whole community.  Read more: CFTC’s Ooki DAO Action Shatters Illusion of Regulator-Proof Protocol  Culpability through participation may help explain why Ooki’s latest governance question on the “Future of Ooki DAO” has gotten zero traction. On Monday, a proposal to create a legal defense fund, and to block U.S. users from Ooki failed with zero votes either for or against.  “Probably people are afraid to vote at the moment,” said an Ooki DAO community member who goes by “Frank” on Telegram. “We will proceed with an onchain proposal and see how that goes.”  Their fear may be well-founded. According to attorney Nelson Rosario, who runs a crypto law practice, token holders may fear that by simply voting on Ooki DAO’s response to legal threats, they could get wrapped up in them.  A second go at the vote received three “yes” responses by press time. If that procedural measure passes, Ooki DAO will hold a binding vote on-chain, Frank said.  If it passes, the proposal pledges to use Ooki DAO’s treasury for legal fees of “any DAO members named in a complaint,” pursue a crowdfunded legal defense fund to protect other DAOs that catch regulators’ ire and allocate the treasury toward the continued operation of the DAO.  If this process is meant to yield a formal response to the CFTC, then the DAO is running short on time: the court’s deadline is by Friday.  Data website Nansen indicates that Ooki DAO has over $3 million in cash on hand, much of it in native tokens.  “I can assure you the Ooki DAO contributors will continue developing our protocol since we have enough funds available,” Frank said.
