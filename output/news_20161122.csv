42379012,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mkeT,1479854144,Bitcoin Startup Blockchain Adds 10 Millionth Wallet,"Wallet service Blockchain has registered its 10 millionth bitcoin wallet.  Data  shows that, as of today, 10,053,518 wallets have been created by users of the service. That’s 7m more than Blockchain reported in February of last year, a significant jump in the roughly 20 months since that time. The service reported just under 9.4m wallets late last month.  Announcing the 10 millionth wallet on its blog, Blockchain cited factors such as the US presidential election, the devaluation of the Chinese yuan and the vote by the UK to leave the European Union as key drivers of interest in bitcoin.  The company said of the milestone:  “While there’s still a lot to do, we can’t help but pause this week to give thanks for the millions of users who are helping us build an open, fair and accessible financial future. We are excited and honored to be on this path with you all.”  Earlier this month, Blockchain said that it was working with payments startup Coinify to create a new in-wallet bitcoin buying option. Currently in beta, the option is expected to see a wider European release in the weeks ahead, followed by a global rollout sometime next year.  Blockchain has raised $30m in venture funding to date from a single Series A round in 2014.

42379009,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mkZR,1479844925,IRS Effort to Access Coinbase Records Could Take Months,"An effort by the US Internal Revenue Service to obtain user records from digital currency exchange Coinbase may take months to resolve.  The IRS filed a petition last week in federal court, seeking court approval to subpoena data on customers who bought or sold bitcoin from Coinbase during the period between December 2013 and December 2015.  Court filings  indicate that no significant action is expected until mid-February. An initial case management conference has been scheduled for 16th February in San Francisco, with 26th January being the last day the two sides could meet to hammer out a possible early settlement. A case docket can be found here.  When reached for comment, Coinbase said that it did not yet have a firm date on which it plans to formally contest the petition in court. The startup said last week that it would fight the petition, stating at the time:  “Our customers’ privacy rights are important to us and our legal team is in the process of examining the government's petition. In its current form, we will oppose the government’s petition in court. We will continue to keep our customers informed on developments in this matter.”  The controversial move by the IRS came days after it published a report from its inspector general which cast a critical eye on the agency’s digital currency strategy. Short of creating a “comprehensive strategy” for the tech, the IG report argued that the IRS risked catching taxpayer violations.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.

42379026,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mkVf,1479838520,"Ethereum's Fourth Fork: So Far, So Good","So far, developers are calling 'Spurious Dragon' a success.  Ethereum's latest hard fork, officially activated at block 2,675,000 today, comes days after the code was first tested as a solution to ongoing network performance issues. Among other changes, the fork will give developers the ability to delete empty accounts left by an unknown attacker that had effectively flooded the network.  While generally seen as a dangerous way to upgrade a blockchain (since it can lead to a network split if the proposed changes aren't accepted by everyone), ethereum's developers have embraced hard forks as a regular way to fix technical problems. This is ethereum's third hard fork in the last four months.  While ethereum's second fork was controversial, ending in two incompatible blockchains, the two most recent forks aim to address ongoing attacks on the network that have slowed down transactions and smart contracts.  Today's hard fork further fine-tunes the prices of opcodes that the attacker abused to cheaply spam the network with transactions, contracts and accounts, that every node on the network needed to run.  'Debloating' the chain  While the upgrade doesn't directly remove the empty accounts created by the attacker, it creates a way to ""debloat"" the blockchain.  ""With this EIP, 'empty' accounts are removed from the state whenever 'touched' by another transaction,"" explains the fork announcement.  Although this hard fork should make it harder to attack ethereum, it's still unclear whether future attacks will impact ethereum users.  ""Now lets see if the attacker has any more tricks up his sleave [sic],"" reads one social media post, summing up the general sentiment.  Notably, the last few weeks have seen a decline in attacks, temporarily halting issues for users that began in September at the time of the project's annual developer conference.  Lingering effects  So far, it seems the impact is minimal.  Shapeshift  and Kraken have temporarily halted ether trades as the hard fork finishes up, but it's worth mentioning that ethereum might have also unintentionally forked last week.  This occurred when one ethereum client, Parity, released a version that forked at a block number that was previously decided on, but later changed. This meant that nodes that didn't update from that version temporarily forked (as not everyone had upgraded from that version).  The development showcases how hard fork best practices are hard to come by, and that in a sense, each one still remains experimental.

42379002,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mkUP,1479833040,Regulators Issue Warnings Over 'Fraudulent' Bitcoin Investment Scheme,"Regulators in Belize and the Seychelles have sounded the alarm about a bitcoin investment scheme.  Belize’s Office of the International Financial Services Commission has said that Xmaxbit, a website claiming to offer cryptocurrency investment and mining services, is not officially registered in the country. A registration document posted on its website is “a complete forgery”, according to the agency.  The Belize government noted:  “This entity is not licensed/regulated by the International Financial Services Commission or any other competent authority in Belize to conduct any type of trading business.”  The agency said that website visitors should “take note and exercise extreme caution” in light of the alleged forgery.  Belize isn’t the only country to accuse Xmaxbit of fraud. Earlier this month, the Seychelles Financial Services Authority issued a similar warning about the site, stating that Xmaxbit was fraudulently claiming that it was registered in the Seychelles.  “Members of the public are therefore strongly advised to exercise extreme caution when dealing with Xmaxbit,” the regulator said.  An request for comment sent to an email address posted on the Xmaxbit website was not immediately returned.

42379004,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mkT9,1479827435,"Most R3 Members Will Invest in Funding Effort, Sources Say","More than 30 R3 member banks are expected to invest in the blockchain consortium startup as part of its ongoing $150m funding round, a source close to the deal told CoinDesk.  According to sources with knowledge of the details, the funding round would find R3 Partners (the startup's capital vehicle) retaining 40% of the company, with member banks allotted the remaining 60% of the venture.  R3 members reportedly had until last Friday to declare non-binding interest in the funding round.  Members who do not participate are reportedly able to join R3 Labs, a separate entity that includes all members who joined after the end of last November when it closed its original 42 members. Reuters reports the original 42 members were given first opportunity to invest, but that the round could be opened to other, non-bank investors.  Banks that do not participate in the funding also reportedly lose their right to have fees paid to date be rolled over toward their investment.  Sources indicated that members were to be alerted yesterday of all other member-banks that expressed interest in the deal.  One source expressed frustration at the length of time that the deal has so far taken, as well as legal fees incurred by participant banks. Another hailed the banks for their cooperation and dedication to what was called a challenging negotiation.  The comments come less than 24 hours after it was revealed that both Goldman Sachs and Santander had previously withdrawn from the consortium, though neither indicated the reasons for their decisions.  R3 indicated it had no additional comment when reached, reiterating a statement first issued to the press yesterday:  ""Developing technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change over time.""

42379008,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mkYB,1479826511,Congressional Committee Calls for CFTC 'Clarity' on Bitcoin,"A Congressional committee has called on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to focus on digital currency regulation as President Barack Obama’s term in office winds to a close.  The Agriculture Committee of the US House of Representatives sent a letter to CFTC chair Timothy Massad in the wake of the election of Republican Donald Trump, who defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential vote earlier this month. The committee's letter expressed concern about so-called midnight rulemaking, or a situation in which an outgoing administration uses its remaining time in office to put new regulations in place.  Committee chair Mike Conaway, a Republican from Texas, called on the CFTC to avoid pursuing “controversial regulations” in the final months of Obama’s term. Instead, the agency should focus on its role as a market watchdog and pursue other kinds of “day-to-day work” including enforcement actions, Conaway wrote.  Conaway went on to suggest that the CFTC could also prioritize initiatives like the regulation of digital currencies before the Trump administration takes over, writing:  “Among the many housekeeping actions the Commission could undertake would be to provide additional clarity about the regulation of digital currencies. Providing the public with more certainty will help strengthen this new technology and protect the participants of these emerging markets.""  The CFTC moved in September 2015 to formally declare that it would regulate bitcoin as a kind of commodity. The pronouncement came as the agency announced that it was settling charges against bitcoin options platform Coinflip.  “Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are encompassed in the definition and properly defined as commodities,"" the agency said at the time.  The agency has also held public hearings on blockchain, and senior officials like Commissioner J Christopher Giancarlo have pushed for the CFTC to adopt a more accommodative stance toward the technology.

42378979,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mhNv,1479819916,Why Remittance Giant MoneyGram Won't Be First With Blockchain,"""I haven't seen enough traction.""  One year after we resolved to set an annual debate, MoneyGram's Peter Ohser remains right, the bitcoin blockchain hasn't disrupted global remittances.  Rather than take off through the power of the Internet, mobile and the price appreciation of a new currency, regulation, last-mile challenges and usability issues continue to keep the traditional powers that be in place.  As for the numbers that have been released (Digital Currency Group asserts that at least $40m in remittances is now going through four of its startups), Ohser isn't exactly impressed given that it's a $600bn market. At Money2020, he echoes many of his critiques from last year. A new, non-governmental currency, he suggests, is still an idea that's a poor fit for cross-border commerce.  To Ohser, bitcoin and digital currencies remain a Napster, a technology that's too-hot-to-touch and likely to remain so for regulated institutions that don't want to deal with something that carries high risk and little upside for their operations.  ""There's definitely money being moved, but for our purpose, for the ability to work with global banks, you can't touch bitcoin, you lose your global banking relationships,"" Ohser said.  But, he sees this perhaps not as something that MoneyGram necessarily agrees should be the case, but something that's inherent in a financial climate where derisking is on the minds of many major banks.  Ohser told CoinDesk:  ""Banks have a hard enough problem with cash, and we're experts in cash. Banks don't like cash, that's clear, but they hate bitcoin even more. That's a real limit for folks like us.""  The conversation isn't exactly a repeat, though.  Rather, Ohser said that MoneyGram remains intrigued by the many blockchain proof-of-concepts (even if he notes they're small in size for the noise they're making), and that he believes it's here where the technology is likely to have an impact.  But unlike the trade finance process, where he sees substantial savings to be had in business-to-business transactions across borders, Ohser characterizes the remittance process as one that's already efficient.  Even with a digital currency, he argues the model isn't going to adjust. It's the back-end of the financial system that he believes is ripe with inefficiencies for the solving.  Cross-border without the middlemen  Interestingly, Ohser's comments on distributed ledger applications mirror what many digital currency supporters have said about their preferred brand of the technology.  For example, Ohser sees the current correspondent banking model (in which financial institutions provide services on behalf of others in trades) as both ""antiquated"" and contributing to financial exclusion.  ""If you're a bank in Africa and you have to trade dollars, they have to trade through France and New York, and everyone wants a piece of the action along the way,"" Ohser argued.  In this light, he sees the wider use of permissioned blockchains as a better way for banks to become better integrated for cross-border commerce, he just doesn't see the banks going away.  Ohser doesn't buy the Internet argument either. While the various web protocols were eventually weaved together into a common consumer platform, Ohser believes blockchain will be different.  ""Because of the regulations, of all the other infrastructure. It's not going to be an open thing,"" he said, adding:  ""There's no one blockchain, it's going to be 6,000 small blockchains.""  Stuck in the middle  Ohser isn't exactly high on the benefits these blockchains could provide for its market.  The reason? He doesn't think paper currency will be removed from the equation, meaning he believes blockchain won't particularly impact the consumer-facing part of his business.  After all, he said, MoneyGram still works with banks (moving data and guaranteeing funds), but ultimately, it's trying to deliver value to end users in physical currency.  ""You have to manage multiple currencies, 120 currencies. For us that's still a complicated business,"" he said.  While he admits there's ""beauty"" in how bitcoin seeks to unite the exchange of data and the exchange of value, he still said it's ""not the right solution"" for MoneyGram.  As for cross-border distributed ledger services, like Ripple Connect, he said they remain an option, but that perhaps the network effect isn't there yet for it to be valuable.  ""You can bring a lot more efficiency in correspondent banking. We still have to move through those chains, but I think that's a huge opportunity to put more cash in our customer pockets,"" he continued.  Here, notably, his comments contrast from last year's, where he said systems like Ripple were perhaps unlikely to change or impact MoneyGram's cost structure.  Fast followers  But while Ohser is interested in the big vision, he said from a company perspective, it's unlikely that MoneyGram would seek to ""push the envelope"" with blockchain.  That's not to say that Ohser doesn't see value in the ideas, just that they don't quite make sense for a major remittance firm to pursue given how he believes that the inefficiencies are on the back-end of the financial system.  ""There's a lot of stuff that's way out there about identity and compliance, practical use cases that are too far out for us today,"" he said. ""[But] if I'm moving millions across borders, and I can save money on BPS, there's going to be movement, but that doesn't happen on the customer side.""  Unlike an increasing number of banks and stock exchanges, Ohser sees the MoneyGram business model as relatively safe given onramps and offramps remain expensive. (As he said last year, his customers need cash, often immediately).  Today, he still argues that with consumers unlikely to change their habits, MoneyGram is in a position to wait and see just what happens when blockchain adoption increases.  ""There's not a lot of upside for being first to market, if it goes wrong you have more to lose. That's where you see our strategy is on the fast follower side,"" he said, concluding:  ""But you pay attention, and you have to be a part of the conversation.""

42378984,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mhGN,1479816304,Tech Giant Siemens is Now Working on Blockchain Microgrids,"A New York blockchain startup has partnered with tech giant Siemens as it expands an ethereum-based peer-to-peer energy transfer project.  LO3 will work with Siemens to grow its TransActive Grid initiative, which enables participants to sell excess power to other microgrid stakeholders. In turn, Siemens will provide the startup with its microgrid control technology, the two firms said today. LO3 was recently awarded a patent for its decentralized energy transfer work by the US Patent and Trademark Office.  Under the partnership, LO3 is working with Siemens’ next47 unit, created earlier this year, as well as its Digital Grid business line.  Siemens representatives indicated that the work conducted between the two firms could have a future impact on its own global customer base. Siemens is one of Germany’s largest companies, as well as one of Europe’s major engineering businesses.  Ralf Christian, CEO for Siemens’ Energy Management Division, said in a statement:  “We’re convinced that our microgrid control and automation solutions, in combination with the blockchain technology of our partner LO3 Energy, will provide additional value for our customers whether on the utilities side or on the prosumer side.""  Siemens and LO3 will test blockchain-powered microgrids in both New York and other locations around the world, the two companies said today, as they look to expand beyond the original test.
