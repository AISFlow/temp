42377115,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6z8RN,1397397330,New Paper Explores Cooling Challenges in Bitcoin Mining Industry,"A new white paper from Allied Control, a technology cooling solutions provider, surveys the current large-scale bitcoin mining ecosystem and explores the implications of current and future cooling technologies.  According to author Alex Kampl, Allied's vice president of engineering, there are significant deficiencies in how mining hardware is manufactured and deployed worldwide. As a result, investors already involved risk losing money and new ones may be dissuaded from taking part at all.  He told CoinDesk:  ""I believe a lot of money is lost with unreliable mining hardware manufacturers – hardware not delivered at all, delivered late, or shipped under promised spec. We all know how miners lose money. This reputation of the mining market and the challenge of deployment, that keeps many investors away.""  The ins and outs of a billion-dollar industry  Over the course of the paper's 30-odd pages, Kampl explores the designs of some of the world's large-scale mining operations and the implications of their cooling efforts.  This includes KnCMiner's 3MW facility in Sweden, which according to Kampl is in the process of expanding by another 9,000 square meters to reach a capacity of roughly 10MW.  With tens of thousands of fans running simultaneously, Kampl estimated that an airflow of 75 million cubic feet per minute (CFM) is required to adequately cool the facility.  Kampl also researched the MegaBigPower Company's 1.4MW mining facility in the United States, the owner of which was recently interviewed by CoinDesk.  Cooling concerns prompted the MegaBigPower team to invest in bigger air conditioning infrastructure, resulting in an average air flow of 150,000 CFM.  Yet the concern of providing sufficient airflow to a mine is only one part of the greater challenge of running a bitcoin operation. Instead, cooling is a multi-faceted process that fits into the broader challenges facing mine management teams.  Kampl writes in the paper:  ""Cooling system parts including heatsinks, fans, water blocks, and support hardware such as enclosures, power supplies and mechanical parts are not an essential part of the mining core, but very often take up a majority of the manufacturers' or mine operators' resources. This results in a large number of suppliers that must be orchestrated to deliver a working product.""  Immersion cooling as a viable option for mines  For Kampl, a key solution lies in the use of immersion cooling. This negates the need to maintain fan systems prone to malfunction or breakdowns. Kampl argued that immersion cooling is actually more beneficial for miners compared to other computing needs in the private sector.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Passive 2-phase immersion cooling is extremely promising, but miners are probably the only ones with the density, flexibility and the need for rapid deployment to use it here and today.""  Addressing the argument that immersion cooling is too costly, even for investors with deeper pockets than the average miner, Kampl said: ""The point of immersion is that it saves money.""  Bitcoin mining ecosystem continues to evolve  Given the potential payoff for investing in mining operations, the environment for both large- and small-scale miners continues to grow – and complicate.  Earlier this week, KnCMiner announced that it will offer modified versions of its Jupiter line of mining products for those who don't want to wait for deliveries of KnCMiner's Neptune device.  DigitalBTC, an Australia-based company which was recently listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, signed a strategic supply deal this month with hardware manufacturer BitFury.  On the malware front, unsuspecting users of the Google Play Store found themselves the targets of mining software uploaders, a discovery made late last month by cybersecurity experts from Trend Micro.

42377129,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6z8iz,1397394277,Bitcoin Vigil Guards Against Intrusion and Coin Theft,"Bitcoin Vigil is a project aiming to give users a new way to detect malware on their personal computers, offering a method of intrusion detection that tracks malware attempting to steal bitcoins from PC wallets.  Eric Springer, a Canadian developer living in Mexico, thinks Bitcoin Vigil's idea is pretty simple:  ""You can just leave the bitcoin wallet on your computer, and it will let you know if you have malware.""  How it works  When users fund a wallet on the Bitcoin Vigil website, they can download a database file containing the wallet's information. It is effectively a wallet generated with bitcoins that is unencrypted to make it as easy on malware as possible, Springer explained.  With the rise of cryptocurrency-stealing libraries being dropped into malware, Bitcoin Vigil acts as what it calls a ""money pot"" – a carrot that malicious software commonly looks for on infected computers.  If the key is used to move the small amount of bitcoins, Bitcoin Vigil notifies the user by email, with an additional option for an SMS notification.  Springer says that malware creators have no qualms about looking for bitcoin like low hanging fruit:  ""I don’t think anyone’s going in specifically targeting bitcoin as their only purpose [for malware], I just don’t think that they have any ethical concerns stealing whatever they find.""  Malware going after bitcoin  Dell SecureWorks recently released a report that identified almost 150 strains of what it calls cryptocurrency stealing malware (CCSM), up from 45 a year prior.  The reason for the surge is simple: decentralized money is becoming popular, and that means it is a valuable thing to take from unsuspecting users.  Joe Stewart, one of the authors of the SecureWorks report, recently tweeted about Springer's service:    Looks like the Bitcoin-wallet-as-host-IDS idea I tweeted on Nov 21 last year is actually a service now: http://t.co/sbUdVbug7x      — Joe Stewart (@joestewart71) April 10, 2014    IDS stands for intrusion detection system, which is Bitcoin Vigil's role in monitoring the wallet addresses.  According to SecureWorks, the most common type of CCSM is known as the ""wallet stealer."" It looks for files in common locations that are similar to ""wallet.dat"" – the same type of file that Bitcoin Vigil uses.  And if the money is moved from the wallet, Bitcoin Vigil's system sees it, said Springer.  ""Whenever it notices a transaction it just looks at all the inputs. And if it comes from one of the wallets I generated I just send an SMS and email out.""  Cryptocurrencies as IT security  Springer said he decided to create the service to detect wallet file theft after realizing one didn't exist. ""After losing some bitcoins, it seemed like a logical idea,"" he said.  Though he concedes to the fact that most people don't keep wallets stored on their computers, he believes that many who are at risk of losing important information on an insecure system unknowingly infected with malware could use Bitcoin Vigil.  Another problem, he said, is that people need bitcoins in order to make this method work, which means it might be more suited for larger systems, versus individual PCs:  ""The limiting factor is that you actually have to put money in each of the wallets.""  Despite these challenges, Bitcoin Vigil again proves that cryptocurrencies can be used as an IT security tool. Recently, crowdsourced IT security startup CrowdCurity launched its 'Capture the Coin' contest, placing bitcoin private keys on its site to see if participants could find them.  ""You need to be on a computer that doesn’t have bitcoin-stealing malware,"" said Springer, and the growing popularity of decentralized money means that malware creators are on the hunt for private keys.  Ideas like Bitcoin Vigil are ways to detect system intrusions proactively rather than running scans reactively when something appears to be wrong.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/13/bitcoin-vigil-guards-against-intrusion-and-coin-theft,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b64f8cfc38df502d08f122c7fc9617307ed688b9-1104x612.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377125,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6z8fD,1397390162,Why Know-Your-Customer Rules Won't Work With Bitcoin,"Know Your Customer rules exemplify why moulding bitcoin into the current regulatory framework won't work, argues Ariel Deschapell.  Regulation is a persistently hot topic in the cryptocurrency world, with a growing number in favour of government getting involved to further legitimize bitcoin.  This includes Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire who recently remarked:  “Bitcoin needs greater levels of governance around it. I do not believe this industry will grow without collaboration from governments around the world.”    Allaire stressed that a middle ground must be found between privacy and the needs of governments and authorities.      This sentiment is reflected by a majority of new industry entrants who want to see bitcoin mature quickly into a legitimate industry in the eyes of banks, Wall Street, and the mainstream in general. It also stands in stark contrasts to the very libertarian spirit still held by many in the community.      Proponents of greater regulatory oversight, such as Allaire, can easily claim to be the practical ones in this debate, recognizing the fact that to achieve its full potential, bitcoin must be incorporated into the existing regulatory hierarchy. While there is little doubt bitcoin can’t continue its Wild West free for all, it’s a little more complicated than that.    Impossible task    It’s obvious governments aren’t going to simply stop trying to regulate cryptocurrency anytime soon. With this in mind, it becomes tempting to simply advocate that the industry 'grow up' and conform to the traditional financial regulatory institutions instead of fighting them.      But however seemingly practical this attitude is, it is anything but. Know Your Customer (KYC) rules are a clear example of why moulding bitcoin into the current framework is a fools' errand at best, and is bound to create highly controversial issues.      US Attorney General Eric Holder has been the latest major figure in the regulatory world to comment on bitcoin:      “As virtual currency systems develop, it will be imperative to law enforcement interests that those systems comply with applicable anti-money laundering statutes and know-your-customer controls.”              Unfortunately it’s not quite that simple. Bitcoin as a whole is a decentralized system that doesn’t require any third parties to interact with, and can’t be controlled or directly regulated by any central authority.      [post-quote]      The only thing that any government would have jurisdiction over are exchanges and other services located within its borders, to which the KYC rules would apply.      KYC rules require money-related services to be able to identify all their customers, and self report 'suspicious activity' that can be signs of anything from money laundering to terrorist financing.      In the traditional financial sector, this makes money laundering much more difficult (although nowhere near impossible). This is because, in order to interact with the modern financial system and transmit money electronically, you need to use a third-party service such as a bank, which are easy points of regulation.    Regulation trade-off    However, with bitcoin it’s an entirely different story.      No one needs a third-party service to own, spend, or send bitcoins anywhere in the world. All that is needed is an open-source wallet, of which there are plenty available to download.      Individuals who are intent on using bitcoin for illegal and malicious uses can easily avoid regulated exchanges and services that require KYC compliance.      In a world where bitcoin is a widely accepted means of payment, forced regulatory compliance to KYC and similar measures does effectively nothing to negate money laundering. It will only serve to increase the cost of running a bitcoin-related company.      As this cost increases those most affected will be fledgling startups who don’t have the extensive legal departments that banks and larger companies possess. This will always hamper innovation, and inevitably push it overseas. So is the trade-off worth it?      For the traditional financial sector it may very well be, depending on who you ask. With bitcoin, however, the picture is far clearer. Every individual is fast becoming able to to move money all over the planet cheaply and without any institutional oversight.      Like any other tool ever invented, bitcoin can be used with both beneficial and malicious motives, and no central authority can do anything about this if they tried. There’s no going back. The real problem is whether governments will accept this new reality and plan appropriately, or continue to fight it.      Regulatory bodies can’t fit bitcoin into current regulatory framework. The two are simply not compatible, and that has nothing to do with any libertarian sentiments in the community. It’s fact.      The degree of oversight government now has in the traditional payments arena is impossible to replicate with bitcoin, as creating appropriate rules for the bitcoin industry would mean starting from the ground up.    Change of thinking    Despite a more compromising attitude from several industry leaders and many in the community, drafting any sensible legislation will be no easy task. I previously wrote that bitcoin is changing everything, and that includes the governments historically iron-clad control of the financial system.      Any massive adjustments to that level of control due to bitcoin aren’t going to take place without controversy. Any systematically sensible approach will require a major change in the way regulators like US Attorney General Eric Holder think of the role of government.      It will cause us not only to rethink what government should monitor, but what it even has the ability to monitor. Will it have any justification to continue to collect private financial data and enforce KYC rules when it only hurts innovation and when the effect on money laundering will be nonexistent?      This is especially important in light of public opinion becoming increasingly wary of large government agencies like the NSA, which are already doing plenty to mine data on entire populations.      Regardless of the desire of industry leaders to speed the regulatory process along, it will probably be a long uphill political battle to create legislation that actually makes sense and thus actually benefits the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole. Certainly trying to fit bitcoin into existing rules won’t be doing it, or anyone, any real favours.      No one should be surprised if cryptocurrency gradually became a larger and more prominent subject in political campaigns as mainstream usage continues to grow, and its effects on the economy and governments regulatory ability start to be felt.    Asking the right questions    The question is, how are politicians and regulators going to react? Will they continue to waste time and effort on the hopeless task of asserting the same amount of control they have in the traditional financial sector? Such an attitude won’t help bitcoin as a whole regardless of the short term 'legitimacy' it gains from it.      Or will governments willingly adjust to a new way of thinking, and thus help push a massive technological innovation that will have immeasurable benefits for the world economy?      The important question isn’t whether bitcoin needs regulation – it’s what kind? And why? That’s the honest and extensive discussion that should be occurring.      This debate carries massive consequences and will undoubtedly be dragged out into the national and public level. The importance and implications of the questions brought up by cryptocurrency demand nothing less.      How exactly all of this unfolds, we will only be able to tell with time. The only thing that is certain is that regardless of the political dilemmas it provokes, the world needs an open-minded approach from governments toward bitcoin, because the world needs bitcoin.

42377127,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6z8gT,1397386523,"Crash and Carry on, Canadian Chip Chumps, and the Internet of Sins","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 13th April 2014 – a regular look at the hottest, most thought-provoking and most controversial events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of scepticism and wonder.      Your host … John Law.    Breaking China  China stamps hard on bitcoin, and the price crashes: what excellent news for investors.  John Law should explain: he’s not shorting bitcoin, and he does feel the pain of anyone who’s got substantial holdings. But in terms of the long-term prospects of cryptocurrencies – and those who are investing time and money on the expectation that the technology itself will prosper – this is no bad thing.  It is now generally accepted, because both the FT and the Economist say so, that China has been the dominant force in driving bitcoin prices up. More than half the bitcoin action in the world has been sucked into the Middle Kingdom, and not because everyone there wants to buy alpaca socks or skinny lattes.  Instead, the suction has been driven by the osmotic fiscal pressure of having a ferocious economy and a fiat currency badly in need of revaluation.  Bitcoin looked very good as an alternative tradable investment device. Too good, decided the Mandarins, who have allegedly re-established the protective veil around the renminbi by banning bitcoin-to-fiat trading.  If true, this would have two effects: one being a little obvious round about now. If bitcoin is to be an investment vehicle, it’ll have to be one without the Chinese involved. Where will the value end up? Well, using the highly scientific method of looking at the price over the past year, John Law reckons around $180 to $230, which is where it was happily sitting for a while before some massive object started to pull it skywards. Eastwards, if you prefer.  The other is that there will be a huge pool of bitcoin sitting in China that can’t be cashed in. But they will still be moved around – like currency’s supposed to do – and they will retain their nominal value as set by the rest of the world. They’ll still have value, but only if they’re used to buy stuff.  An industrious and hard-working nation like China will make use of that. Alpaca socks and skinny lattes are unlikely to see much of a surge, but you can bet your bottom yuan that deals for goods and services will be struck and bitcoin will circulate. Which means its true value, as a damn fine mechanism for circulating, will be realised – alongside all the ancillary economic activity in support services and products.  Which is good news for those investing in such things. When faced with broken china, get cracking.  MintChip takes a licking  MintChip sounds delicious, like the sort of ice cream John Law remembers – along with sunburn and sand in his socks – from childhood summer holidays. But the ice creams of yesteryear have long since melted and MintChip, a Canadian government initiative in electronic currency announced in 2012, is going the same way.  The Canadian state is trying to wash its hands of the sticky residue, hoping that a private company will take it over, but enthusiasm is as limp as a Magnum left in a glove compartment for five hours on the hottest day of the year. (Don’t ask – thank God it was a rental.)  But why has it failed, you cry. How can a government project, run by a government agency, tied to the existing government currency, based on a physical chip, limited to one country and relying on governmental software, not have generated the excitement of bitcoin?  It’s hard to credit. But check out this Q&A with MintChip project boss Marc Brûlé – who sounds like he’s named after a posh pudding himself – as he went on a 2013 promotional press circus. The idea was cooked up at a retreat of the Royal Canadian Mint executives, where they decided what consumers wanted from electronic currency. They’re a diversified business. They’re good at patents, too.  To be fair, MintChip did get some things right – peer-to-peer transfers, low overhead, usable just as physical currency online and in real life. Real advantages, and key features any electronic currency will need to succeed.  So why has bitcoin been so successful that governments are trying to ban it while government and big business projects sink out of the bottom of the cone like a melted 99? Remember Visa Cash? Mondex?  It’s called letting go. What the Internet knows, and what big pre-Internet concerns do not, is that unless you are a certifiable genius, trying to guess what people want is a really bad way of giving it to them. Hollywood, as William Goldman said, is a place where nobody knows anything. Turns out that that’s true of most things. People are ungrateful sots who persist on deciding for themselves what they like. The best way to make that work for an idea is to put it out there and see what use is made of it – and to make sure that anyone can say “Hm, yes… but what if we try it this way?”.  Before the Internet, the closest most businesses got to that was focus groups and pilot projects – or just spending enough on marketing to persuade people that they did want something they wouldn’t otherwise look twice at. Or going on a retreat with your pals and pretending to be certifiable geniuses. That way, you get cash-onna-dongle.  What bitcoin and chums have that the Royal Canadian Mint does not isn’t some sort of philosophical purity or magic, God-given genius. It has reddit, Github, blogs and open code.  And that can’t be licked.  Architecture and Morality  John Law is easily puzzled, but the equation of bitcoin mining with immorality really has him beat. How can it be moral, the argument goes, to burn all those planet – endangering megawatts in the chase for something so ephemeral and tainted with greed?  As Coindesk’s own Danny Bradbury is so eloquently exploring, if you take that tack you better be prepared to look at the same equations for the rest of the financial system. It’s also worth casting a look at, oh, gold mining, which chomps through so much power that even at the current exalted price for the metal it’s actually becoming uneconomic. And that gouges actual holes in the planet.  But perhaps the critics have a point. After all, every action does have a moral component, and we are comprehensively mucking the environment right up. People don’t want to be evil, but it is impossible to know whether plonking down on the sofa to watch Game of Thrones on a 40” plasma is more culpable in the pleasure-vs-guilt scale of things than driving into town to buy the books. And what if you order them online? More to the point, can bitcoin actually be an unarguable force for moral good?  John Law has a modest proposal. Alongside the Internet of Things, where all our devices talk to each other about what they’re doing, we must create the Internet of Sins, where they talk about us.  Like any useful technology, the IoS takes something that humans need to do but are bad at doing, and offers the services of automation to relieve us of the burden. Think of it like carbon offsetting but with micropayments and – crucially – a central exchange of naughtiness that sets a value on the good-to-evil scale for everything. It will be a bitcoin of cosmic responsibility: the karmacoin.  All our interactions with technology are metered and stored, these days, and just about everything we do is an interaction with technology. Your TV knows what you’re watching and how much power you’re using, while the shop that sells you your TV set knows who made it and how it got there. In turn, the acts of manufacturing and transportation are documented in detail by the computer systems that manage them. The oil that goes into the plastic, the metals that go into the circuitry, the investments in education or armaments that the bank that finances the TV makers has, everything can be factored in.  The architecture of the Internet of Sins is conceptually simple. Each such interaction can be graded on the good-versus-evil scale and the value stored, to be transferred along the chain. You’ll end up with your share in your karma wallet whenever you take an action, all transferred by the same anonymous-yet-unfakeable protocols that power cryptocurrencies. The good-versus-evil index will be created by a global database of acts graded by mass consensus – a computerised version of how we decide our morals anyway. The flame wars in the comments will be epic.  What we do with our accumulation of karmacoins will, in the end, be up to us. But at least we’ll truly know the consequences of our actions.  Bet it won’t just be the Chinese that ban that.  John Law is an 18th Century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler.
