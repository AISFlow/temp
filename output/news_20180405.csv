42428808,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe7Dh,1522969208,BitFlyer Adds Computer Language Co-Creator as Advisor,"BitFlyer has hired the co-creator of a programming language as an advisor to help with its scaling and enterprise blockchain efforts.  Tom Love, co-creator of the programming language Objective-C – perhaps most notably used by Apple for its OSX and iOS operating systems – will advise the cryptocurrency startup on both strategic and technology initiatives, chief operating officer Bartek Ringweski told CoinDesk in an interview.  Ringweski said bitFlyer particularly hopes to leverage Love's experience in order to help it build on its 'miyabi' private blockchain, which he called ""the fastest blockchain in the world"" capable of handling 2,000 to 4,000 transactions per second.  The company now hopes to create a ""programming language that would let developers interact with miyabi, and that is more familiar to them as if it were a traditional database,"" Ringweski explained.  Asked what this language might look like, Love told CoinDesk:  ""I have a strong bias toward things that are simple, clear and easy to understand, and that are successful. So I hope to help bitFlyer in exactly those same ways.""  Love started his career at General Electric Company and has also held executive management positions at ITT, IBM and Morgan Stanley, but the role at bitFlyer will be his first endeavor in the blockchain industry.  Despite this, Love said the company is a natural fit.  ""I've had a history of connecting myself with important technologies dating back to the 1970s, and this looked like a similarly important and significant technology,"" he said.  Ringweski said Love's experience will help the company expand, though it already offers exchange services in 43 U.S. states, Japan and the EU.  ""He's a great person to help us on the technical front, but we can also benefit from his experience on the business and regulatory side,"" Ringweski said. ""He's worked in highly regulated spaces.""  ""I have a history of working inside large companies and starting small companies that have made a difference,"" Love explained to CoinDesk, adding:  ""So, I have a wealth of experience and a wealth of contracts that I can call upon to be helpful to the company in a variety of ways, like I've been for other companies in the past.""

In a blog post, the startup announced that it was adding withdrawal support for the forks, though the post did not announce a firm timeline.  ""This change will allow customers to more easily withdraw assets associated with Bitcoin Forks across all Coinbase Products,"" the startup wrote, adding:  ""As always, we look at technical, operational, and legal considerations when deciding which Bitcoin Fork assets to support and will always state on our website which particular assets are supported.""  That being said, Coinbase noted it was ""not announcing support for any specific assets at this time.""  In the announcement, Coinbase explained that it will work to support future bitcoin forks on its Coinbase Custody product, adding that this platform ""will likely support more forked assets than GDAX or Coinbase for the foreseeable future.""  GDAX, its digital assets exchange, will allow customers to withdraw bitcoin forks, but not trade them. Similarly, Coinbase's basic platform will also allow customers to withdraw the forked assets but without enabling trades. Further, the startup noted that an asset may be added to GDAX in the future without being added to Coinbase.  Coinbase Commerce, a merchant-focused service it unveiled in February, will not support any forked assets, and the Coinbase Index Fund will not list any assets that are not available on GDAX for trading, according to the statement.  In a separate announcement on Thursday, the startup unveiled a new early-stage venture fund that will provide financing to companies working with the technology.  ""At least in the beginning, our goal is simply to help the most compelling companies in the space to flourish,"" Coinbase said.

42428809,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe7Bh,1522959389,SEC Chief Touts Benefits of Crypto Regulation,"The SEC's highest-ranking official appears to be softening his sentiment toward ICOs.  At a Princeton University event Thursday, SEC chairman Jay Clayton went so far as to reject the idea that all ICOs are fraudulent, answering ""absolutely not"" to a question centered on whether his agency's actions against the founders of blockchain projects amounts to such an admission.  Clayton's remark came during a talk on ""Cryptocurrency and Initial Coin Offerings,"" one that was notable given his past statements, including his most famous issued in February, in which he said that he believes ""every ICO"" he's seen qualifies as a security. Indeed, Clayton opened the talk by telling the assembled students he believes that ""distributed ledger technology has incredible promise for the financial industry.""  The SEC chairman went on to argue that the steps taken by the agency in recent months could actually help the industry mature overall.  He told attendees:  ""Is the approach taken in Washington by the SEC adversely affecting distributed ledger technology in other areas? My quick answer is that my hope is that it’s actually helping – because this technology is being used for fraud and to the extent that it’s being used for fraud, history shows that government comes down harshly on that technology later.""  Clayton continued: ""I think if we don't stop the fraudsters, there is a serious risk that the regulatory pendulum – the regulatory actions will be so severe that they will restrict the capacity of this new security.""  Utility token debate  Elsewhere, Clayton discussed the evolving terminology of the industry.  One of the issues with token sales, he remarked, is the attempt to classify them as so-called ""utility tokens,"" which would ostensibly free them from any kind of designation as a security. As such, he reiterated his view that almost all token sales purport to sell such products, despite the fact that they are actually securities.  If a startup is ""offering something that depends on the efforts of others, it should be regulated as a security,"" he told the gathering of students on Thursday.  Clayton used an analogy to describe the difference between a utility token and a security token.  ""If I have a laundry token for washing my clothes, that’s not a security. But if I have a set of 10 laundry tokens and the laundromats are to be developed and those are offered to me as something I can use for the future and I’m buying them because I can sell them to next year’s incoming class, that’s a security,"" he explained.  Still, he suggested that such a definition can evolve over time.  “What we find in the regulatory world [is that] the use of a laundry token evolves over time,"" he continued. ""The use can evolve toward or away from a security.""  Further, nations may experiment with sovereign cryptocurrencies, while startups might develop different kinds applications with the underlying technology, he added.  Whether a token qualifies as a security could also change as the industry evolves, he said, adding:  ""Just because it’s a security today doesn’t mean it’ll be a security tomorrow, and vice-versa.”  Jay Clayton photo by Mahishan Gnanaseharan for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,없음,MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET | TOKEN SALE,"Nikhilesh De, Mahishan Gnanaseharan",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/05/sec-chief-touts-benefits-of-crypto-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3449cca1ac060b91d6b124ceac28a24f049e75c-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Andrea Maechler, a member of the central bank's three-person Governing Board, told an audience in Zurich that distributed ledger technology (DLT) – which she equated with blockchain technology – has the potential to reduce costs, improve efficiency and add transparency to securities settlement and cross-border payments.

The speech was delivered in German, though the SNB released an official translation that contained her remarks.  And while she struck a critical tone on the topic of cryptocurrencies – remarking that they are ""not comparable with money – far from it,"" Maechler's most pointed remarks were reserved for CBDC, a concept being researched by a range of central banks worldwide.

42428803,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe71h,1522949452,Japanese Research Group Calls for 'Appropriate' ICO Rules,"A research group in Japan has put forward a series of proposals related to initial coin offerings, including those focused on investor protection and money laundering prevention.  Spearheaded by a Tama University professor and general advisor Takuya Hirai, a member of Japan's House of Representatives, the ICO Business Research Group features advisors such as Yuzo Kano, the CEO and co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer and includes members drawn from various financial institutions, venture companies, and private-sector businesses. The group was first formed last November.  ""Appropriate rules must be set to enable ICO to obtain public trust and to expand as a sound and reliable financing method,"" the report, released Thursday, reads.  Though not indicated in the Group's publication, Bloomberg Technology reports that the proposals will be considered by the country's financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), later this month, with the possibility of eventually becoming law.  In February, a report indicated that the agency is considering the revision of existing laws and regulations to account for token sales. The FSA also issued a warning last October emphasizing the risks associated with ICOs.  Varied proposals  On the question of issuing and selling tokens, the group argued that issuers should provide a means for tracking the development of white papers, in addition to outlining ""conditions for the provision of conveniences such as services and rules on the distribution of procured funds, profits, as well as residual assets, to investors of tokens, shareholders and debt holders.""  Likewise, the Group recommends that ICOs should be designed ""to be acceptable to existing shareholders and debt holders,"" and should not be used as a means of circumventing traditional financing methods.  In order to protect investors, the authors suggest that token issuers should comply with existing KYC methods in order to assess the suitability of investors and to confirm their identities. They also advocated for measures to prevent insider trading.  ""Cryptocurrency exchanges should define and adopt an industry-wide minimum standard on token listing,"" the report adds, concluding:  ""Although there are a wide variety of issues to be considered and it would not be easy to find solutions for all of them. We hope the above proposals would contribute to future discussions by each related party.""

In addition, the MFSA noted that StocksBTC ""appears to be offering investment and/or other financial services to consumers.""

In recent months, officials in India have publicly stated that the government does not recognize bitcoin as a form of legal tender.  At least one cryptocurrency exchange in India has downplayed the significance of the move.

Revealed Thursday, those questioned by police reportedly included Kim Ik-hwan, the CEO of Coinnest, though the identities of the other executives and the other exchange have not been made public.  The prosecutor's office told Reuters that the executives are being questioned about ""the embezzlement of billions of won from their clients' accounts and transferring it to their own."" ($1 billion won is worth roughly $940,000 at current exchange rates.) The developments were first reported by Maeil Business Newspaper, a South Korean daily.  Coinnest has since released an update indicating that, amid the police action, its executive team has been replaced.  The statement reads:  ""In order to resolve customer anxiety and sincere vocation requirements, the Coinnest Board of Directors has removed the involvement of executive management from the point of the last investigation and has been switched to a specialized management system.""  The company also pledged to carry out audits of user accounts via third parties, and to disclose the results in the ""near future.""  Coinnest is South Korea's fifth-largest exchange and the world's 51st-largest by 24-hour dollar trading volumes, according to CoinMarketCap.  Wednesday's detentions come amid an increased focus on South Korea's cryptocurrency platforms from authorities in recent months.

However, a representative of one of the exchanges, Bithumb, characterized the incident as a ""visit"" from the National Tax Service in an email to CoinDesk. March also saw authorities raid three exchanges over alleged embezzlement.  Additionally, South Korea's cryptocurrency market has been subject to growing regulatory scrutiny. The country prohibited local companies from conducting initial coin offerings (ICOs) in September and required cryptocurrency investors to use bank accounts linked to their real names in January.  These measures came in response to a surge in cryptocurrency trading in South Korea, particularly among the young, which caused concerns among both government officials and regulators.

Notably, the verge chain was attacked yesterday, with the hacker reportedly making off with $1 million-worth of tokens. The issue was first brought to notice by a user named ""ocminer"" on the Bitcoin Talk forum.  The verge team acknowledged the attack via Twitter in the afternoon Wednesday, while its primary developer, ""DogeDarkDev,"" tried to calm market nerves by stating that the team has pushed out a ""quick fix"" and the team is working on ""a whole new block verification process"".  However, the quick fix turned out to be a hard fork, as pointed out by ocminer. That didn't go down well with the investor community, which called for a rollback to cancel the coins mined during the hack. The developers rejected that idea, however, and attempted to downplay the whole episode by calling it a ""small attack."" The team is scheduled to release the full fork update today.  Amid the melee, XVG witnessed solid two-way business.  According to Bittrex, the token fell from $0.0722 (05:00 UTC yesterday) to a low of $0.048 (07:00 UTC) today before regaining some poise. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $0.055 – down 13 percent on a 24-hour basis.  It is worth noting that prices had jumped to a six-week high of $0.078 on April 3, possibly due to successful crowdfunding campaign and speculation that verge is partnering with a major retailer.  Despite the pullback to $0.048, the short-term outlook remains bullish, as per the technical studies.  Daily chart  XVG cleared the descending trendline hurdle in a convincing manner on April 1 and closed well above $0.056 (March 27 high) on April 3, signaling a short-term bullish trend reversal.  The cryptocurrency has established higher lows, as represented by the ascending trendline and higher highs, as indicated by a move above $0.056 on Tuesday. So, XVG looks set to scale the 100-day moving average (MA) resistance lined up at $0.0789.  Additionally, the chart shows a ""death cross"" – a bearish crossover between the 50-day MA and the 200-day MA. However, the indicator tends to be a lagging indicator and shouldn't be a cause of concern as long as prices hold above the ascending trendline.  View  The short-term outlook is bullish and XVG will likely test $0.0789 (100-day MA) in the next couple of days. A break higher would expose $0.10 (psychological hurdle) and $0.135 (Jan. 21 high).  On the downside, a drop below the ascending trendline would abort the bullish view, while a break below $0.032 (March 30 low) would put the bears back in the driving seat.

42428800,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe6xh,1522936818,Chainalysis Raises $16 Million for Real-Time Crypto Compliance,"Blockchain startup Chainalysis has today announced a new real-time cryptocurrency compliance tool and a $16 million Series A investment from Benchmark Capital.  Founded in 2014, Chainalysis provides cryptocurrency exchanges, international law enforcement agencies, and other clients with bitcoin transaction analysis software to help them comply with regulations, assess risk and identify illicit activity. Notably, the company helped investigate the Mt. Gox bankruptcy case.  ""What we decided when we founded Chainalysis was that we need to solve how we can make the new world of finance work together with the old world of finance. Basically, how can we bridge the gap between banks and bitcoins?"" Co-founder Michael Gronager, previously the chief operating officer of Kraken, told CoinDesk in an interview.  More specifically, co-founder Jonathan Levin explained that the firm builds a data set that links ""real-world activity to cryptocurrency transactions so that we can uncover the underlying real-world purpose of the transaction.""  Until now, Chainalysis' software has only allowed customers to analyze transactions retroactively. Its new tool, dubbed Chainalysis KYT (for ""know your transaction""), provides transaction analysis in real time.  This gives exchanges, for example, the capacity to instantly know if they are dealing with a trusted financial institution or with suspicious entities, Levin said. Exchanges can then use this knowledge to inform how they treat deposits and withdrawals on their platform, he added.  Levin claimed that the rapid expansion of the cryptocurrency industry has made this software a necessity:  ""When we started the business, exchanges were much smaller. They could use manual reviews and have the types of rules in place that allowed them to be compliant. Today, they're onboarding the same amount of customers on a weekly or monthly basis. So now there are millions of customers who need automation tools to trigger reviews and to do investigations, and you need to have these investigations not take half an hour to 45 minutes. It needs to be right up front.""  The company has trialed the product with several existing unnamed customers, Levin said, adding that they've seen a ""20x improvement"" in the speed of investigations.  And there's more  Chainalysis' software previously only supported the bitcoin blockchain, but the company announced on Thursday that it is rolling out bitcoin cash-compatible tools for its law enforcement and government clients. Furthermore, Gronager and Levin said the company will aim to support 10 cryptocurrencies by the end of 2018.  To fund this expansion, the company will tap some of the $16 million garnered from its funding round with Benchmark Capital. However, the funding isn't the only thing Chainalysis has acquired from Benchmark, which has been investing in the industry since 2014.  The company also snagged Sarah Tavel, a general partner at the firm who was previously a product manager at Pinterest, for its board.  ""Chainalysis is really an enabling technology that you need to participate in this ecosystem,"" Tavel told CoinDesk.  The company's appeal, she said, comes from its founders' early recognition of the need to address compliance obstacles in order for the ecosystem to grow.  In her new capacity as a board member, Tavel said she hopes to use her experience at Pinterest to help the company scale.  ""I think a lot of what I bring to the table is just the experience of having scaled through hyper growth and helping them, as much as possible, look around corners,"" she explained.  Levin and Gronager don't expect Chainalysis' rapid growth period to stop anytime soon – but just not because governments and law enforcement agencies are becoming increasingly interested in the industry.  ""We've seen just massive interest from the cryptocurrency market,"" Levin said, adding:  ""Actually, despite market conditions, that part of our business is growing stronger than anything else. It's been exploding. We've got triple the number of customers in that segment than we had last year, and that growth is actually just accelerating.""

42428801,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe6zh,1522933224,An XRP ICO? It's On Whether Ripple Likes It or Not,"It turns out, you can launch crypto tokens on Ripple's XRP Ledger, and a small group of coders are seeking to be among the first to do it.  Stepping back, that might seem strange on multiple levels. For one, there's XRP Ledger's association with Ripple, the San Francisco startup that has largely tried to distance itself from cryptocurrency, mostly focusing on offering distributed ledger tech to some of the world's largest financial firms. Second, there's the fact that XRP Ledger, while open-source, isn't exactly known as a platform.  But while ethereum has been the go-to blockchain for entrepreneurs that want to launch cryptocurrencies, it turns out that lately, a significant number of token issuers have been looking for alternatives. And for Allvor, a small Brazil-based company focused on streamlining digital payments, the XRP Ledger is proving an attractive option for running what it hopes will be a significant token-based business.  And they couldn't be more excited.  ""The XRP Ledger, which is developed by Ripple Company, is the best and most efficient distributed database technology ever made,"" according to Allvor's white paper, which reads more like a fanzine for the technology.  According to the company, XRP Ledger's main selling point is its speed, but there are several other reasons why they think Ripple's distributed ledger is the perfect place for crypto tokens.  Still, Ripple seems less thrilled about the idea. In statements, the company sought to emphasize that by nature it can't prevent even exotic uses of its technology due to its open, public codebase.  According to a Ripple spokesperson:  ""XRP Ledger is open-source and a decentralized platform, so people can build whatever they want, but Ripple isn't interested in promoting or supporting ICOs on the ledger.""  And that unenthused response might lead to issues down the line.  An opt-in airdrop  For one, Allvor understands that to succeed in its mission of streamlining e-commerce it needs a system that does more than just settle transactions.  It'll need a system that integrates with merchant's logistics, customer management and marketing software. As such, it's launching a token called ""ALV"" and building a platform that the token interacts with.  ""The ideal would be if a merchant of any size could install the software or plugin that makes the ALV payment feasible within 10 minutes,"" said Cleyton Domingues, the co-founder of Allvor and a longtime staffer in Brazil's economy ministry. ""Our challenge will be to develop the software that makes the integration possible.""  Yet, the company, which doesn't have investors but instead has bootstrapped the project itself, remains unfazed, primarily because its executive believes XRP Ledger already offers a variety of benefits.  For example, Allvor's white paper says that the ledger's ""hybrid payment gateways"" technology will allow them to more easily set up a truly global system.  And since users of the ledger have to set up ""trust channels"" with people they'd like to transact with, users will feel like they have more control over what crypto tokens they receive. This is particularly important since recently both retail and institutional investors have lamented the spammy nature of token airdrops, whereby issuers seed users with tokens merely based on the amount of another token – like ether – they have.  But Ripple's system means that users will have to opt-in to receive tokens.  Allvor is creating 100 billion ALV tokens – with 5 percent being sent to current XRP holders (if they opt-in) based on the amount they held as of March 27.  Not the first  Still, investors may be wary of entering a market that's challenging to exit.  Despite XRP's recent surge in popularity (it's now the third largest by market cap), Ripple executives have struggled to entice major U.S. exchanges, like Coinbase and Gemini, to list its native cryptocurrency, according to Bloomberg.  Yet, Jon Holmquist, an industry entrepreneur and founder of the Bitcoin Black Friday movement, said that might not matter since Ripple's protocol is designed to work as a decentralized exchange of sorts, capable of representing all kinds of assets.  And Holmquist should know – he was actually the first to launch a token on Ripple in June 2017.  Through the ICO, Holmquist earned $1,500 in XRP, but after about a month, he decided to refund investor's money to steer clear of the regulatory hammer, following guidance put out by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on The DAO.  ""I think a lot of ICOs are hesitant to be the first ones,"" Holmquist told CoinDesk.  That said, he expects more entrepreneurs to see the benefits of the XRP Ledger for token issuance even despite the lukewarm reception the concept has received.  And there's plenty of untapped potential, he said, adding:  ""I think the Ripple community is very strong. You can tap into the network with investors sitting on XRP and nothing to do with it.""

42428847,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe7Vh,1522931421,IBM Envisions App Testing Powered By Blockchain,"IBM may one day be testing software applications on a blockchain system, public filings show.  In a patent application released Tuesday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the company describes a ""blockchain test configuration"" that could provide a ""simple and secure infrastructure for testing applications"" by allocating testing tasks to ""miners"" who could be rewarded with bitcoin or another cryptocurrency upon completing a given task.  Such a system could reduce the amount of money and resources that current cloud-based test infrastructures require, IBM says.  ""Software automation testing has become more hardware intensive as the complexity and requirements of new software applications continues to increase,"" the filing reads. ""To run automation test cases at a needed frequency requires a large hardware pool of resources which can exponentially increase as the test cases and number of applications increase.""  The document, which was filed in December 2016, presents a three-fold proposal. It first details a method by which a request to test a ""package associated with an application"" could be submitted to a network of nodes and executed via a ""contract document,"" like a smart contract. The smart contract would provide ""all the information that is required to execute the test cases and the reward.""  More general information about the application test package could be published to ""an entire P2P network in a ledger,"" the filing says.  The method could also include receiving results based on the test and recording those results on a blockchain.  In connection with this, IBM envisions an apparatus that would include a transmitter that would send the test request to a network of nodes, a receiver configured to receive results of the test and a processor, which would then record those results on the blockchain.  Finally, the filing describes a ""non-transitory computer"" for storing instructions prompting the processor to transmit a test request, receive test results and/or record the test results on the blockchain.  As far back as 2013, IBM filed a blockchain-related patent that proposed a system to track the value of digital currencies. The blockchain would ""track the life cycle of any individual e-currency token"" both to detect its use in illegal activities and allow for a more accurate estimation of its worth, the document said.

42428811,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe7Lh,1522929618,"US Crypto Tax Policy Isn't Just Crazy, It's Cruel","Perianne Boring is the founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto and Taxes 2018 series.      “April is the cruelest month….”  So, begins T.S. Eliot’s masterpiece The Waste Land. While the poet wasn’t referring to the U.S. tax season, it fits. And there is something extraordinarily cruel, crazy even, in the IRS's approach to the tax treatment of virtual currencies.  The blockchain has the power to promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. Those objectives just so happen to be two of the six purposes of the American government as laid out in the preamble to the Constitution.  So, it’s awkward that the IRS, an agency of the federal government, adopted an interpretation of the tax law that severely inhibits the achievement of these ends.  The problem? In 2014, the IRS determined that it would treat “convertible virtual currency,” such as bitcoin, as property. That decision subjects it to capital gain (or loss) and investment income tax treatment and associated reporting requirements.  What does this mean? Every time you pay your DISH Network bill, make an Overstock.com purchase, or book a hotel on Expedia using bitcoin, the IRS requires you to record the amount, allocate your cost basis in the satoshi (or ether, or what have you) to make the purchase, subtract the cost basis from the price, and report the difference to the IRS while calculating the capital (long or short term, depending on when you bought that one) gain or loss on your tax return.  And pay a tax, if it’s a gain.  That’s a prohibitive quagmire when selecting a payment method. It’s not just prohibitive. It’s crazy.  Incoherent policy  Stepping back, this is symptomatic of a broader problem with Washington's disjointed approach to the technology.  As I recently wrote inThe Hill (with a nod to Lewis Carroll):    ""The breakthrough distributed ledger technology known as the blockchain is being given the 'Mad Hatter' treatment by the federal government.      The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is eyeing virtual currency as a commodity. The SEC is beginning to treat certain tokens as a security. The U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has stated that certain activities involving convertible virtual currency constitute money transmission. The IRS treats convertible virtual currency as property.    Commodity? Security? Currency? Property?    Four different, inconsistent categories for the same thing.""    Both the IRS and FinCEN are agencies of the U.S. Treasury yet they have taken wildly differing approaches. Coherence lies in treating virtual currencies as an alternative to government-issued currency for tax purposes.  That’s our tax policy position, and it has the support of the blockchain sector. We developed it in consultation with some of the most respected economic policy experts in the world and after nine months of consultation with many of the more than 160 Chamber members.  Central banks around the world are exploring the concept of central bank-issued digital currency. How can something that is treated as a currency by a central bank be considered property?  Watchdog weighs in  Meanwhile, the IRS is on shaky ground. The Treasury’s own Inspector General issued a detailed report in 2016 criticizing the agency’s stand:  “It does not appear that any of the actions already taken by the IRS to address virtual currency tax noncompliance were coordinated to ensure that the IRS maintains a strategic approach to the tax implications of virtual currencies.”  Further, the Inspector General observed:  “For example, if a taxpayer uses a portion of a bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee each day for one week, he or she will have to determine what portion of the bitcoin was used to make the purchase based on the daily exchange rate, convert it into U.S. dollars, and keep a record of each transaction so that the gain or loss from his or her virtual currency property can be properly reported. [The IRS’ property guidance] does not provide taxpayers with guidance on what records should be kept and how the records should be maintained. Due to the potential complexity of reporting otherwise simple retail purchase transactions related to virtual currencies, further guidance is needed to help taxpayers voluntarily comply with their tax obligations.”  Years later, the IRS has yet to provide such guidance.  To add insult to injury, the IRS issued a “’John Doe’ summons” to popular exchange Coinbase for the records of half a million bitcoin owners, demanding access to enormous amounts of customer data.  The IRS’s demand provoked criticism from powerful Congressional officials, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch. In the face of that and other criticism, the IRS drastically reduced the scope of its demand. Still, this kind of fishing expedition is onerous and scuttles the path to adoption of this technology.  Our policy team is active on Capitol Hill educating Members of Congress and staff on the imperative need for the federal government to have a coherent approach to the blockchain, not a patchwork of contradictory approaches.  The Congressional Joint Economic Committee recently devoted an entire chapter of its annual report to the blockchain, citing our work and recommending: “Regulators should continue to coordinate among each other to guarantee coherent policy frameworks, definitions, and jurisdiction.” Among the most important elements of such coordination is tax treatment.  April, the cruelest month? Quite possibly. Congress should treat virtual currency as an alternative to government-issued currency, giving consumers choice, and expressly exempt convertible virtual currency transactions from investment and capital gains treatment and associated reporting requirements.

The Android-based smartphone – called the Finney – is being built from the ground up, with special features that should appeal to cryptocurrency enthusiasts, including an app store for distributed apps (dapps), secure storage for crypto wallet keys and simple conversion between tokens.  According to Bloomberg, the Finney is expected to start shipping in October for around $1,000, and will initially be sold at eight new stores, to be sited in crypto hotspots around the world. Sirin CEO Moshe Hogeg told the news source that the phone may eventually be sold via mobile carriers too.  Sirin said that over 25,000 Finneys have been preordered so far, and the company is eyeing a sales target for 2018 in the range of 100,000 to several million.  As reported by CoinDesk, Sirin Labs raised $157 million in December for the project in an initial coin offering, in addition to $70 million raised previously.  The Switzerland-based company said at the time that the product will fill a gap in the fast-growing cryptocurrency market for a secure device that can simplify the use of cryptocurrency across multiple applications.  Notably, the Bloomberg article suggests that the Finney will have a secure part of its hardware for cryptocurrency that is enabled via a physical switch.  By licensing the phone's technical advances to other phone makers, Sirin hopes the price for a Finney could later fall possibly as low as $200.

42428818,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe7Th,1522922413,Make or Break? Bitcoin Risks Bear Revival Below $6.5K,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell below the $7,000 mark on Wednesday, neutralizing the immediate bullish outlook.  More worryingly for the bulls, a further decline towards $6,425 (recent low) would turn the tide in favor of the bears, the technical charts indicate.  The cryptocurrency witnessed a head-and-shoulders breakdown at 09:00 UTC yesterday and fell to $7,000 (target as per the measured height method). The hourly momentum studies (moving averages) were aligned for a bullish move at the time, hence BTC was expected to defend the psychological mark.  However, the sell-off gathered pace early in the U.S. session, pushing BTC down to a low of $6,670, according to Bitfinex data. Interestingly, the drop in BTC prices coincided with a 500 point sell-off in S&P 500 futures.  Since late February, bitcoin and U.S. stocks have been moving more or less in tandem, indicating the cryptocurrency is still being perceived as a risk asset.  By the day's end, U.S. stocks had turned positive, yet bitcoin fell further to $6,565 in the Asian hours before regaining some poise. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,847 on Bitfinex.  While the retreat to $6,565 has turned the tide away from the bulls, all is not lost. A close today (as per UTC) above the 10-day moving average would still boost the odds of an upside break of the falling channel (seen chart below).  Daily chart  The 5-day moving average (MA) is flatlined (neutral) and the 10-day MA is biased to the bears (sloping downwards).  A close above the 10-day MA, currently seen at $7,148, would signal the sell-off from $11,700 (March 5 high) has ended at $6,425 (April 1 low) and will likely yield a bullish falling channel breakout.  The channel resistance is seen sloping downwards to $6,600 in the next 24 hours. An upside break of the falling channel would confirm the short-term bullish trend reversal.  View  The immediate outlook is neutral.  A close above the 10-day MA may result in a bullish falling channel breakout.  A break below $6,425 (April low) could yield a drop below $6,000 (February low).  A further drop towards the falling channel support of $5,450 cannot be ruled out, as the daily relative strength index shows sufficient room for another $1,000 drop in prices.

Citing sources on Thursday, Nikkei Asian Review said that, once the deal is complete, Coincheck plans to change the management team in an attempt to rebuild investor confidence following the hack that saw $530 million in NEM tokens stolen in January.  While information is still sparse, Monex is expected to pay Coincheck several billion Japanese yen for its majority stake (1 billion JPY = $9.34 million). The deal is currently being finalized, Nikkei states, and an announcement may be made by Friday.  As part of the changes to the executive team, Monex's chief operating officer, Toshihiko Katsuya, will take over as new president, according to the report, with Coincheck's current president Koichiro Wada and COO Yusuke Otsuka to step down as soon as the deal is inked.  News of the possible takeover bid broke Tuesday, with Nikkei first reporting the rumor. Monex soon after confirmed it was considering the move.  Coincheck has faced investigations from Japan's financial watchdog over the security failures that led to the hack, as well as its financial health.

42428813,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe7Jh,1522915242,Arizona's Governor Signs Latest Blockchain Bill Into Law,"Arizona corporations can now hold and share data on a blockchain following the signing of new legislation into law by the U.S. state's governor.  The bill, first introduced by Representative Jeff Weninger, amends the Arizona Revised Statutes to recognize data written and stored on systems using the technology, as previously reported. Governor Doug Ducey signed the measure on April 3.  The Arizona House passed the bill within eight days of its introduction, records show, and the senate followed suit roughly a month later. While the senate unanimously voted to pass the bill, four House Representatives voted against or abstained.  The amendments come a year after Arizona began recognizing signatures recorded on a blockchain and smart contracts as legal documentation. Also signed by Ducey, that law allows these signatures to qualify as legal electronic signatures, meaning individuals can sign records or contracts on a blockchain.  The new legislation comes amid increased interest in blockchain applications across U.S. state governments.  Lawmakers in Delaware advanced and passed similar measures in 2017, becoming the first U.S. state to provide a legal basis for trading stocks on a blockchain.  Also last year, a lawmaker in New York introduced four bills aimed at evaluating blockchain applications for data storage purposes, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  Similarly, a bill introduced to the Nebraska legislature earlier in 2018 would, if passed, also allow the state to recognize smart contracts and documents stored on a blockchain. The bill would also ""authorize and define smart contracts,"" as well as allow the government itself to adopt distributed ledger technology.

Launched last May, CoinList revealed Wednesday it has raised $9.2 million to build out a platform where accredited investors can invest in initial coin offerings (ICOs), or custom cryptocurrencies issued by startups and open-source projects. Investors in the round include Polychain Capital, FBG Capital, Libertus Capital, Electric Capital, Blockchain Capital, CoinFund and Digital Currency Group.  The news closely follows CoinList's announcement in October that it would continue to pursue its model, one that had seen it offer support for Filecoin's record-breaking September ICO, as a standalone company.  Still, that's not to say there won't be changes that reflect the sector's shifting regulatory environment in the U.S.  In statements, CoinList co-founder and CEO Andy Bromberg notably said the company plans to use part of the fresh capital to build a secondary exchange for blockchain-based securities.  ""There is not right now a good tokenized exchange for securities,"" Bromberg told CoinDesk. As such, CoinList hopes to be the first to introduce ""a liquid and compliant secondary exchange for securities.""  The statements point to the growing tension between crypto innovators, who have argued that cryptocurrencies, even when issued in public sales, can be considered commodities, and U.S. regulators, who have largely asserted such creations are captured by securities law.  Still, in this environment, CoinList said it hopes to distinguish itself by offering investors access to high-quality projects that buck the fly-by-night reputation industry offerings have sometimes attained.  Bromberg told CoinDesk:  ""The best projects are being directed toward CoinList as a the place to go to run a client token sale.""  Selective strategy  Going forward, CoinList detailed how future sales will be operated to ensure anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) due diligence is performed on all platform users.  While the exact rules around accreditation are slightly complicated, users must meet an income or asset threshold: at least $200,000 in annual income for an individual, or $1 million in net assets.  But while that may seem to limit the service's clientele, Bromberg said the platform has so far processed $400 million in investments from thousands of users, with more joining every day.  So far, CoinList has seen three ICOs launch through its platform, Filecoin, Blockstack and Prop, and CoinList representatives said the pace of launches is perhaps unlikely to escalate in the short-term.  ""It's really a matter of being incredibly selective there,"" Bromberg told CoinDesk.  Another challenge, Bromberg acknowledged, would be liquidity, especially as the cryptocurrency market cools and a fear of regulators creeps back into the community.  Bromberg, however, remained confident, concluding:  ""Initially, I think we'll be relying on our investor base to drive capital into the market and do market making … We'll be able to offer real liquidity to a lot of these securities.""

42428812,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe7Hh,1522900806,Mexico Tests Blockchain to Track Public Contract Bids,"The government of Mexico has been quietly working on a project to track bids for public contracts using blockchain, a government official revealed Tuesday.  Speaking at a tech conference in Jalisco, Mexico's national digital strategy coordinator Yolanda Martinez detailed Blockchain HACKMX, a project she said has been in production since last September. The system was initially developed by a team of university graduates whose design won a contest calling for blockchain solutions that can help improve public services.  ""With blockchain applied to public contracts we'll be able to know whether a company that provides services to the government is trustworthy,"" Martinez tweeted.  According to Mexican news outlet Debate, Martinez told attendees that the technology would eliminate the ""easily corruptible"" human element and introduce transparency to the public tender process. Martinez also pointed out that the blockchain would store records of the bidding process, allowing for audits after the fact.  Technical details about the project are not available, but Debate's report suggests the project will eventually be rolled out to the public, with the government eyeing it as a solution for state and local governments in particular.  A presentation entitled Blockchain HACKMX, which is available on the UN's website and appears to date from July, weighs the benefits of various platforms that could potentially host the network: Hyperledger Fabric, bitcoin, ethereum, Chain and NEM. The presentation suggests that computers participating in the network would be run by a mix of government offices, universities, civil society groups and private companies.  The issue of public contract corruption is a sensitive one in Mexico, given a recent high-profile scandal that involved a major South American construction firm and allegations that bribes were funneled to the political campaign of President Enrique Pena Nieto.  Transparency International, an anti-corruption non-governmental organization (NGO), rates the country 135th out of 180 in its Corruption Perceptions Index.

42428797,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe3vh,1522894547,R3 Researcher: Central Bank Blockchain Could Go Live In 2018,"A form of central bank digital currency (CBDC) may go live in 2018.  At least that's according to Antony Lewis, research director at global banking consortium and distributed ledger software startup R3, who issued the prediction during a panel discussion at the Deconomy event in Seoul, South Korea, on Wednesday.  “For wholesale use (of CBDC), I think we are looking at this year. We have had conversations with central banks who have mandates to fix certain payment problems, and one solution they look to is a blockchain type of platform,” Lewis said.  Yet, Lewis clarified that this does not mean consumers will have a new payment choice that functions like bitcoin or ether do today, per se. In fact, Lewis projected that such a cryptocurrency would be used only by select financial institutions to start.  In this way, Lewis argued such a system would likely even only be used in certain specific situations, such as in instances of disaster recovery due to their current limitations.  He argued:  “Don’t make your secondary (decentralized) system look like your primary (centralized) system. Otherwise If a primary system goes down in an attack, then all the attackers need to do is just to play the same trick. Then it’s not resilience, it’s just another IP address to attack.”  Other panelists weren't as optimistic as Lewis in their projects, though they agreed on points.  Stanley Yong, global CBDC lead at IBM and a former CBDC researcher at Singapore’s central bank, for instance, said he believes that a blockchain system will eventually be best applied to commercial banking.  ""If it issues cryptocurrency to millions and billions of citizens, it will have to hold all these individual accounts, which inherently increases the market and credit risks,” Yong said.  Taking a different angle, Ian Grigg, a financial cryptographer, said it may not even be the fundamental role of central banks to issue a retail CBDC. Citing the Bank of England as an example, Grigg explained that the policy of the institution is to support the deposit of commercial banks.  As such, directly issuing a cryptocurrency to the public could undermine the deposit base of existing commercial banks, which subsequently will affect the loan market, Grigg said.  The view echoed past comments from the Bank of International Settlements, which in a previous report stated that a CBDC could give rise to ""higher instability of commercial bank deposit funding.""  Still, while projections varied, there was an optimism that blockchains would replace existing banking technology, with Yong going so far as to state such systems are “due for retirement.”  Image via Wolfie Zhao for CoinDesk",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/05/r3-researcher-central-bank-blockchain-could-go-live-in-2018,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1f73bc8bacd873b3bdf078aa76e5db34148086b-2874x1798.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
