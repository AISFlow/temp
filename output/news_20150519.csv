42398373,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTL3z,1432070135,Overstock Invests in Broker-Dealer Ahead of Decentralised Stock Market Launch,"A new Wired report suggests that US retail giant Overstock has completed a working demo of its decentralised stock market Medici and that the project may soon be presented to US regulators.  The report  is one of the first to suggest the Medici project is moving forward past conceptual stages following its October launch. Updates on the project have since been scarce with two high-profile developers leaving in February and Overstock submitting an SEC filing related its proposed issuance of digital securities in April.  The latest Wired report further indicates that Overstock has purchased a 25% stake in Pro Securities LLC, a New Jersey-based brokerage firm on whose electronic system it says Medici has been built.  Pro Securities manages the buying and selling of securities on behalf of its clients, acting as a registered arbiter between customers and the exchange. As such, the involvement of the firm could be read as a signal that Medici development has advanced to the stage where such services may need to be available.  According to the US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Pro Securities is registered with the SEC, two self-regulatory organisations and four US states.  Representatives from Overstock did not respond to immediate requests for comment.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/05/19/overstock-invests-in-broker-dealer-ahead-of-decentralised-stock-market-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c3f1a48c5f8e1259f282d00aea85238d27b670e-1500x1024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398389,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTLFn,1432056884,Charlie Shrem and the Ups and Downs of BitInstant,"In his new book, Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money, Nathaniel Popper, examines the rise of cryptocurrency and the characters who have played their part bitcoin's story so far.  In this excerpt, the New York Times reporter looks at the trials and tribulations of bitcoin exchange BitInstant before its ultimate demise.  In June of 2013, things appeared to be going well for Charlie Shrem.  He was shopping for new, larger real estate for his company, BitInstant, and eventually settled on a well-appointed suite in an office tower not far from the company’s original offices in Manhattan. He had also recently managed to move out of his parents’ basement in Brooklyn. He was motivated to do this, in no small part, because he was afraid to tell his parents about his girlfriend, Courtney, who was a waitress at his favorite bar, EVR. Courtney was some ten years his senior and, more important, not Jewish – something that did not fly in the Syrian Jewish community that Charlie came from. Charlie and Courtney took a room in a big communal apartment above EVR, where there were always alcohol bottles and bongs on offer. Charlie was often spotted at EVR with Courtney on his arm.  But within BitInstant, Charlie’s hard-partying ways seemed to many like an escape from the challenges he was facing with his company. The Winklevoss twins had been pushing Charlie to raise more money to pay for BitInstant’s expansion. And Charlie had no trouble getting meetings with investors, who were all impressed at the sheer number of dollars already running through BitInstant. But as Charlie’s team tried to get the investors the paperwork they needed, it quickly became clear how unequipped BitInstant was for the big time. When the BitInstant chief financial officer, who was just two years out of college, tried to put together the financial statements he realized that there were large holes in the company’s books, with unexplained expenses in all directions.  In late June, Charlie finally managed a long-planned relaunch of BitInstant, in partnership with a money-transmitting business that was regulated in most states. But when the site went live and BitInstant began doing more thorough checks of its customers, Charlie’s staffers realized that many of their customers had been doing business with them under fake identities. When the Manhattan district attorney sent a disconcerting request to Charlie asking him to come in for a meeting, it precipitated an emergency conference call with a team of lawyers on July 4.  “The problem is that the site is a patchwork of bandages,” one of the lawyers told Charlie and his team. “When we go into that meeting, they’re going to go straight to the site and review it in detail. They can’t see a patchwork of quick fixes.”  The lawyers were unrelenting, and the answers from Charlie made them nervous: no, BitInstant’s compliance officer had no previous experience in compliance, and no, BitInstant had not filed any suspicious-activity reports with regulators despite having lots of transactions flagged as potentially fraudulent by partners. The call concluded with a long list of things that needed to be handled immediately.  “You are very exposed on all fronts,” the lawyer told Charlie and his team.  Charlie tried to show how serious he was about complying with all the rules, but the old problems were quickly joined by new ones. A couple of customers disputing transactions filed a lawsuit, for which they were seeking class-action status. When the Winklevoss twins read Charlie the riot act, he responded with total contrition.  “Things ARE changing dramatically to fix problems on all fronts and put us in a position for growth as quickly as possible,” he told them. “I’ve made a lot of mistakes, the ones that you guys called me out on as well as others that I’m seeing now and taking steps to fix.”  But there wouldn’t be time for that. Charlie was in the new BitInstant offices, which he had moved the company into less than two weeks earlier, when he got a letter from his lawyers telling him that because of the number of legal questions, they could not represent him in his upcoming meeting with the district attorney unless he shut down the site and resolved all the problems.  Charlie reached the Winklevoss twins while they were in the car on the way to their family beach house. They laid the blame entirely at his feet and demanded the return of the $500,000 loan they had made back in April when business was booming.  On Friday, July 12, at 9 p.m., Charlie took the BitInstant site down, for what he thought would be only a temporary hiatus.

42398383,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTLAs,1432044525,New York Stock Exchange Launches Bitcoin Price Index,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has today announced the launch of a bitcoin price index (NYXBT).  NYXBT will represent the daily US dollar value of one bitcoin at 4pm (BST) and will be published on the NYSE Global Index Feed (GIF).  For a limited period it will also be viewable on the NYSE's website.  Thomas Farley, NYSE group president, said in a statement:  ""Bitcoin values are quickly becoming a data point that our customers want to follow as they consider transacting, trading or investing with this emerging asset class.""  He added: ""As a global index leader and administrator of ICE LIBOR, ICE Futures US Dollar Index and many other notable benchmarks, we are pleased to bring transparency to this market.""  The bitcoin price index will use data from transactions taking place on San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange Coinbase.  However, a statement released by the NYSE said that it would continue to review other bitcoin exchanges to see whether they met the criteria required for inclusion in the index. ""The NYSE Bitcoin suite of indices is anticipated to grow, with new indices introduced over time.""  Growing interest on Wall Street  The move comes after the Wall Street stock exchange invested in Coinbase's $75m Series C funding round, which closed in January this year.  Speaking to CoinDesk  following the announcement, Farley said: ""With this investment, we are tapping into a new asset class by teaming up with a leading platform that is bringing transparency, security and confidence to an important growth market.""  The NYSE is not the only firm on Wall Street investing in the digital currency.  Multinational banking giant Goldman Sachs recently participated in a $50m funding round raised by bitcoin financial services startup Circle.  Just last month, developers at the Bank of New York Mellon Corp were revealed to be experimenting with bitcoin's open-source code on the bank's new corporate recognition program.

42398391,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTLJj,1432029850,Darkwallet and Armory Come Top in Bitcoin Wallet Privacy Study,"Bitcoin wallet providers Darkwallet and Armory performed the best in an independent test that sought to identify the strongest wallet offerings for financial privacy.  Darkwallet  version 0.8.0 and Armory version 0.93.1 both received top scores of 45 out of 100 from the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project (OBPP) Spring 2015 Wallet Privacy Rating Report, the first release from the open-source organisation that seeks to promote and improve privacy in the bitcoin ecosystem. Scores were based on performance in five categories that assessed the privacy the wallets offered from blockchain observers and network observers, among other factors.  Ranking last in the study was Coinbase's online wallet, which received a total score of eight out of 100. Coinbase notably received no points in three of the five categories, while elsewhere, Mycelium, the Bitcoin Wallet and Electrum rounded out the top five wallets.  OBPP contributing engineer Justus Ranvier said he hopes the report will be the first in a triannual series of releases aimed at providing a way for consumers to better evaluate marketing efforts around bitcoin wallets.  Ranvier told CoinDesk:  ""For people to make informed privacy tradeoffs, they need informed information about what they are trading off. I'm not aware of any other group that has attempted to quantify privacy, everything before has been pretty vague.""  As evidence to how this approach is beneficial, Ranvier noted that, while Darkwallet and Armory scored similarly when evaluated, the former company more heavily advertised its privacy benefits to bitcoin users.  ""Darkwallet put in lots of features, but the fact that Armory has a full node makes a huge difference,"" he said.  Wallets were evaluated using a threat model, he explained, a process by which such statements are assessed through the use of measures similar to ones deployed by hackers.  Additional OBPP participants who conducted testing included Blockchain Security Engineer Kristov Atlas and OpenBazaar operations lead Sam Patterson.  First of many  As a first trial, Ranvier indicated that the OBPP team had a much larger list of wallets it was seeking to test, but that ultimately only 10 were chosen due to resource challenges. Final selections, he said, were based on contributor perceptions of the popularity of the offerings.  Going forward, Ranvier said he expects to revisit the findings every three months, at which point more wallets could be rated. The engineer went on to explain this initial release was meant to start the conversation surrounding privacy, and he is seeking to evolve the assessments with user feedback.  ""We don't expect our rating model is perfect but we think it can get better over time. It gives people something to work with when they're trying to compare features,"" Ranvier continued.  To assess these more specific marks, OBPP divided its five major categories into 14 sub-categories, each of which was assigned one or more of three classifications – usability, quality and feedback.  Ranvier said he envisions similar testing could be done to assess bitcoin wallet security, but there are no plans for OBPP to take up the task at this time.  Usability and quality  Two wallets built primarily with security and privacy as core focuses – Darkwallet and Armory – were praised as generally successful in their aspirations by the OBPP team.  Darkwallet scored the highest in the receiving address generation and backup categories, with a 16 of 21 category score. The wallet received the lowest marks in the privacy it offers from network observers, taking just three of 25 points.  By contrast, Armory scored its highest marks in the privacy its wallets offer from network observers, with its lowest marks awarded for the privacy it offers transaction recipients.  Darkwallet and Armory were the top two in overall usability and quality, with Armory taking the top spot in quality and Darkwallet scoring the best in the usability category. Ranvier described quality as a metric to determine how well bitcoin wallets were able to deliver privacy functions, while usability measured the effort users would have to exert to unlock benefits.  Airbitz tops feedback rankings  While the usability and quality rankings showed similarity in terms of the top offerings, OBPP found that Airbitz version 1.4.6 performed the best in terms of feedback, or how well the product warns users they could be compromising their privacy.  Airbitz was largely propelled to this top spot based on its strong performances in the address generation and backup, and change address generation and backup categories, but received no points for the privacy it awarded transaction recipients.  ""AirBitz was one of the first mobile wallets to use an HD architecture, which permits it to easily protect user privacy by automatically generating new addresses for receipt of funds and change,"" the report authors wrote.  Airbitz ranked fifth in terms of usability and eighth in quality. The Bitcoin Wallet also performed strongly in this category, ranking second.  Coinbase and Airbitz declined to comment on the report.

42398375,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTL5x,1432018950,Ripple Labs Raises $28 Million in Series A Round,"Digital currency startup Ripple Labs announced today that it has closed a new $28m Series A funding round.  The company drew support from a mixture of new and existing investors, including the venture arms of US futures and options exchange CME Group and data storage firm Seagate Technology.  Other participants in the round include AME Cloud Ventures, ChinaRock Capital Management, China Growth Capital, Wicklow Capital, Bitcoin Opportunity Corp., Core Innovation Capital, Route 66 Ventures, RRE Ventures, Vast Ventures and Venture 51.  The company said that it planned to use the funds to fuel international expansion efforts, most notably in Asia. In a statement, Ripple Labs CEO Chris Larsen said the new support would also facilitate access to liquidity in the Ripple system, thereby enabling new customers to come onboard, adding:  ""With investors like CME Group and Seagate joining the fold, we’re well positioned to accelerate adoption amongst these key customers.""  The announcement follows months of speculation that the company was raising a new round of funding. In January, the Wall Street Journal reported that Ripple Labs was seeking as much as $30m in a Series A round. Ripple Labs raised $3.5m in seed funding in 2013.  The funding disclosure comes weeks after Ripple Labs was fined by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for violations of the US Bank Secrecy Act.  Asia push  In its announcement, the company highlighted its intention to focus on growth in Asian markets. Notably, Li Feng of IDG Capital Partners will be joining Ripple Labs' board of directors.  “Growing their influence in key regions like Asia will help activate new markets, further accelerating the use of Ripple as a real-time settlement protocol by the world’s leading financial institutions,"" Feng said in a statement.  Commenting on the deal, Seagate senior vice president of finance and treasury Dave Morton took a more global stance, noting that his company sees the opportunity in supporting global transfer mechanisms that can help reduce friction between parties.  ""Banking and corporate applications are just the tip of the iceberg for a technology like Ripple, and we're excited to support the team's pursuit of those opportunities,"" he noted.
