42399713,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyZSq,1491944524,European Central Bank: Still Too Early for DLT in Eurozone,"The European Union's central bank today once again shot down the idea that it might use distributed ledger tech as part of its market infrastructure in the near future.  Published alongside the latest annual report from the European Central Bank, released today, was a feature on the tech. While largely written in broad strokes, the paper reiterates a position expressed in the past by ECB officials – namely, that the central bank isn't likely to tap distributed ledgers in the near future.  The ECB wrote:  ""The ECB is open to considering new ways to enhance its market infrastructure. However, any technology-based innovation would have to meet high requirements in terms of safety and efficiency … At this stage of its development, [distributed ledger technology (DLT)] is not mature enough and therefore cannot be used in the Eurosystem's market infrastructure. As DLT-based solutions are constantly evolving, the ECB will continue to monitor developments in this field and explore practical uses for DLT.""  The language closely mirrors statements from ECB executive board member Yves Mersch, who in December remarked that ""the ECB cannot, at this stage, consider basing our market infrastructure on a DLT solution"", highlighting similar concerns focused on cybersecurity and operational efficiency.  Still, the ECB is pursuing a research effort alongside the Bank of Japan, which sees the two institutions weighing potential applications. And, in its feature, the ECB kept the door open to possible use in the future, though it offered nothing in the way of a possible timeline or indications as to what would drive it to utilize the tech.  ""As DLT-based solutions are constantly evolving, the ECB will continue to monitor developments in this field and explore practical uses for DLT,"" the central bank said.  The ECB has been actively testing the tech since early last year.

The bank, along with Deloitte and startup Eternity Wall, began testing the new proof-of-concept late last year.  At the heart of the project is the open-source OpenTimestamps protocol, developed by Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd, which Eternity Wall later moved to implementhttps://blog.eternitywall.it/2016/06/24/announcing-opentimestamps-support/. It uses the bitcoin blockchain as means to notarize transactions, creating a publicly available record trail for later referral.  Carlo Brezigia, information security officer for the bank, explained:  ""Relevant data has been hashed to produce a short unique identifier – a digest – equivalent to its digital fingerprint. This fingerprint has been associated to a blockchain transaction and hence registered on the blockchain: the blockchain immutability provides robust non-refutable timestamping that will always prove without any doubt the existence of that data in that specific status at that precise moment in time.""  The bank tested the tool between October and February, according to Deloitte, and the firm said that future plans include support for multiple blockchains, potentially including private ones.  The trial notably showcases a willingness on the part of a regulated financial institution to experiment with a public blockchain. In a statement, Gianni Cavallina, the bank's retail innovation accelerator officer, spoke to both the interest in testing such protocols beyond the use case of digital currency.  ""In particular, considering public blockchains, we are exploring the applicability of different use cases, abstracting from the value of its native digital currency. Notarization is one of the most interesting application[s],"" Cavallina said.  Intesa Sanpaolo – a member of the R3 distributed ledger consortium – has tested a number of blockchain use cases in the past, including trade finance and digital identity.

42399727,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyZdf,1491931219,Bitcoin's Latest Scaling Twist: Support is Building for a UASF,"It seems to be one thing after another for bitcoin.  Amid the long-standing debate, one well-known bitcoin developer recently posted a note to the project's mailing list alleging a major mining entity is prolonging the debate over scaling because it would accidentally wipe out a technical advantage that gives it an upperhand over other miners.  It's unclear his claims are true. Even supporters admit there isn't hard evidence, and many others are skeptical.  Despite this, many in the community think there's enough circumstantial evidence to back it up, and a grassroots movement is growing in the hopes of pushing through the change that miners are now being accused of blocking.  Normally, miners are the ones that are tasked with pushing through such a fix. But because of this roadblock, some in the bitcoin community are calling for a different (more experimental, yet older) method of making a change to bitcoin based on support of the so-called ""economic majority"", instead of miner support.  The change is known as a ""user-activated soft fork"", or a UASF.  Coinkite CEO and co-founder Rodolfo Novak, an advocate for the nascent movement, said it aims to correct perceived inequities that have so far dominated the years-long scaling discussion.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Miners trying to centralize bitcoin is an unacceptable thing. It goes against what bitcoin is supposed to be. This UASF is really like saying, 'No, we control bitcoin, not you.'""  And, support appears to be growing. There's a website and a Twitter. There are UASF hats.  Though the code isn't safe to run yet, some volunteers running nodes are now flagging support with their nodes. Volunteers who run nodes can signal their support by adding a line to their node configuration file.  Flagging support  Since the allegations were made last Wednesday, node support for the change has grown to 4.8%, or by about six times.  But, since the code isn't ready yet, and users are just showing support, does it really mean anything?  ""On a technical level, signaling it that way does absolutely nothing, it does however help the case on a social level and prevents users from running an outdated version of the code when enforcing starts,"" developer Damian Mee argued.  Beyond just gauging users' support, some unidentified developers are allegedly testing and reviewing the reference implementation put forward by the pseudonymous shaolinfry in the proposal BIP 148.  But, so far they're secretive about it, and are waiting to see if people flag support for the change or not. (Though, one contributor delivered a reddit AMA on Monday.)  That said, there's a long been back and forth on the topic of this metric because node counts are easy to spoof.  For example, one entity can spin up a bunch of nodes in a data center in a sybil attack, as it's formally known.  Economic majority  So, simple node count might not be the best indicator. Due to how a UASF works, it could be necessary to have explicit support from the ""economic majority,"" or exchanges, wallets, and other bitcoin economic players.  And, support from key economic players is so far at about 6% since the BIP was put out on March 12th (by one metric), admittedly sparse. Though, others are allegedly on the way, many are starting to announce their company's support via reddit.  However, Novak pointed out that a sizable percentage of bitcoin nodes are running Bitcoin Core, and the versions with SegWit, which he thinks is a good indicator that the fuzzily-defined ""economic majority"" supports SegWit, and thus a UASF version of it.  This is perhaps notable given that the code is backwards-compatible, so the 80% of nodes that are currently ready for SegWit, would also be ready for the change.  Given this, Novak said he's ""very optimistic"" the plan to scale the network could ultimately work.  Again, there’s while there's a reference code implementation, it hasn't been fully tested and reviewed yet. The original activation date for SegWit was put at October 1st, 2017, but shaolinfry, recently moved it up to 1st August, meaning, if the community supports the proposal, that miners need to signal support for SegWit by that date, or they will fork off the network would need to upgrade.  Cautions to the wind  If it sounds dangerous or as if the idea is being rushed along, many believe it is. It's highly possible that the current aura of confidence in the proposal is the result of high tensions.  Others are proceeding more cautiously, as shown in one bitcoin developer chatroom.  ""I'd say we want [it], if we think there is community support,"" said lead Bitcoin Core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan, when asked if developers should consider coding up Maxwell's suggested BIP.  Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille mentioned that it's ""complicated"" to determine when that threshold is met.  ""Whether that BIP is the best solution to that is indeed open, indeed makes sense for the dust to settle on that, though it may still make sense to have actual code,"" Van der Laan added later.  In the mailing list thread where he outlined his allegations against the miner in question, Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell proposed using the method, but agreed that going through with it would depend on the level of support from the community.  Yet another development is that some developers are calling for a UASF on litecoin, a smaller blockchain by market cap, as both a way to get it on SegWit, and as a way to ""test"" how a UASF would pan out should it prove to be as divisive as other proposals.  But like past attempts to scale bitcoin, it remains to be seen if cooler heads, or strong passions, will prevail.

Euroclear announced today that it completed the second stage of testing for its platform, developed in partnership with blockchain startup Paxos, with a group of 16 financial institutions including Citi, Scotiabank and Société Générale. More than 100,000 bullion settlement transactions were conducted over a two-day period, the firm said.  The pilot comes months after Euroclear announced the completion of the first phase, during which about 600 transactions were conducted. Euroclear first unveiled the platform in June.  According to the firm, the successful test paves the way for a full production launch sometime in late 2017.  Angus Scott, head of product strategy and innovation for Euroclear, said in a statement:  ""We are encouraged by the extensive engagement of market participants in this second pilot and will continue as we further develop this new market infrastructure for the bullion market.

42399722,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyZYk,1491921008,Two Months And Counting: Exchange Withdrawals Still Blocked in China,"One month after China's bitcoin exchanges announced they had upgraded their services in response to requests from regulators, digital currency withdrawals remain frozen for users.  According to local exchange representatives, speaking on background, the companies remain in talks with the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank and chief financial markets regulator. At issue, exchange officials said, are the know-your-customer rules that would be put in place on reopening.  Talks are said to be ongoing between the two camps, with the PBOC favoring stricter rules for customer onboarding. One source, Roland Sun, a legal lead for blockchain consortium ChinaLedger, said that the KYC proposal was ""pending approval"" from the PBoC.  The developments are the latest that come amid what has been a period of quiet after a turbulent year for China's bitcoin startups.  At the start of 2017, the PBOC issued a warning to the startups amid a volatile period for the bitcoin price. Still, conversations began shortly thereafter, with local bitcoin exchanges agreeing in February to pause withdrawals for one month while perceived issues were addressed.  PBOC officials have since gone public about their desire for exchanges to have strong KYC and anti-money laundering (AML) restraints, reporting that money laundering and capital flight were top concerns.  Exchange traders, on the other hand, largely migrated to peer-to-peer platforms or relied on in-person deals. In March, the exchanges announced they had completed the upgrades – a move they hoped would spur a decision, prompting optimism a decision would be made after a major regulatory meeting.  Still, despite delays, some local exchange representatives expressed optimism that the process is nearing conclusion, and that withdrawals would soon resume, if later than expected.  ""I think there will be a result in the first half of the year,"" Zhou Shouji, operator of OTC trading firm FinTech Blockchain Group, said in remarks.  Other exchange representatives said the process would reach a conclusion soon, though they did not provide a time estimate.  Elsewhere, other parts of the ecosystem appear to be moving forward, with an event in Chengdu in June set to see participation from BTCC and OKCoin, among other regional blockchain startups.

42399711,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyZPt,1491916522,Russia Eyes Legal Recognition for Bitcoin in 2018,"The Russian government is reportedly looking to recognize bitcoin as a kind of financial instrument in 2018.  According to Bloomberg, senior Russian officials including Deputy Minister of Finance Alexey Moiseev and representatives from the Bank of Russia (the country’s central bank) are developing a position on bitcoin and digital currencies as part of a bid to cut money laundering risks.  Moiseev reportedly indicated that the government wants access to information about transaction parties, and that services in Russia handling digital currency payments would be required to collect and submit that data.  He told the news source:  ""The state needs to know who at every moment of time stands on both sides of the financial chain. If there’s a transaction, the people who facilitate it should understand from whom they bought and to whom they were selling, just like with bank operations.""  While Russia’s final position remains to be seen, past developments have suggested a move toward a softer stance on the technology.  Back in 2015, the government initially proposed steep fines on the use or creation of digital currencies. Those proposed penalties were later beefed up in an amended draft later the same year.  However, last August, officials reportedly backed away from a more punitive approach soon after Moiseev himself indicated that Russia could recognize bitcoin as a kind of foreign currency.

42399714,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyZQs,1491912005,Bitfinex Sues Wells Fargo Over Bank Transfer Freeze,"Digital currency exchange Bitfinex filed suit against banking giant Wells Fargo late last week, after the bank moved to limit its ability to send funds worldwide.  Specifically, the suit – filed in a federal court in San Francisco, where the bank is headquartered – alleges that the bank has prohibited four Taiwan-based banks that do business with Bitfinex from completing outbound wire transfers. The banks in question, according to the filed complaint, are KGI Bank, First Commercial Bank, Hwatai Commercial Bank and Taishin Bank.  Named as plaintiffs in the case are Taiwan-based iFinex, Inc, along with two British Virgin Islands subsidiaries and digital asset transfer firm Tether.  In addition to seeking an injunction against Wells Fargo in order to prevent the wire transfer stoppage, the exchange is seeking more than $75,000 in damages.  The news is a major development for an exchange that has seen no shortage of significant events in the past year. Last summer, Bitfinex was robbed of tens of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin. In the aftermath, it issued a novel digital asset aimed at reimbursing affected users – the last of which were redeemed at the end of last week.  Allaying concerns  As might be expected, news of the suit and the blocked transfers has sparked fears of locked funds and the specter of an exchange collapse. A representative for Bitfinex took to social media soon after word of the suit emerged, declaring that ""to be clear, this isn’t a regulatory action"" and that no funds have been frozen.  They went on to say:  ""The decision to initiate legal action is because we cannot allow precedents in this industry where clearing houses can disrupt businesses that are by all metrics complying with the rules in place. If we allow them to simply flip a switch and disrupt business, then there becomes a precedent in the bitcoin industry beyond just Bitfinex, so we believe it is the appropriate time to take action.""  So, what brought on the wire transfer freeze? Public records detailing correspondence between Bitfinex’s legal representatives and Wells Fargo reveal few details, apart from a seeming unwillingness to engage on the part of the San Francisco-based bank.  For now, Wells Fargo is staying quiet on the case, declining comment when contacted by CoinDesk.  Battle to come  Public records  show that, as of Sunday, a summons had been issued in the case, with an initial hearing scheduled for 10am PST on 25th April. That hearing will focus specifically on the motion for a preliminary injunction sought by Bitfinex.  Yet, at least one outside observer expects the exchange to run into at least some legal hurdles as it takes Wells Fargo to court.  Stephen D Palley, a Washington, DC-based lawyer, suggested that Wells Fargo may challenge the jurisdictional nature of the suit, given that the plaintiffs are based outside of the US.  Should it get past that potential problem, other pitfalls could trip up the effort as well, according to Palley.  ""Even if Bitfinex gets past a jurisdictional motion, it has no privity of contract with Wells Fargo. As a consequence, it pleaded a cause of action for 'Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations.' I know nothing about the underlying facts, but strictly as a legal proposition, this is a hard theory to prove,"" he told CoinDesk.  Palley concluded:  ""I can’t imagine that [Wells Fargo] really wants to intentionally interrupt Bitfinex’s business. It seems more likely that compliance red flags were raised.""

42379428,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87l8N,1491908406,Exchange Bug Discovery Averts Ethereum Token Theft,"A bug discovered last month could have potentially emptied exchange accounts holding digital tokens used to power the ethereum-based distributed application Golem.  However, due to the nature of the bug, it could also have been used on other ethereum tokens listed at the exchange. That's because it used the platform's ERC-20 standard, a feature that has won advocates in the exchange sector due to its ability to reduce the time it takes exchanges to add new coins.  However, a Golem supporter and a GNT holder found the bug on 18th March and reported it to the developer team before it could be used maliciously.  The problem that came to light stems from how exchanges prepare the data for transactions and how Solidity (the ethereum smart contracting language) encodes and decodes the transaction data, according to Golem Factory software engineer Pawel Bylica, who published a report on the issue.  According to his assessment, the service that prepared the data for token transfers assumes a 20-byte long address input, but didn't actually check to ensure that the input was the correct length.  As a result, a shorter address length caused the transaction amount to be shifted to the left, thereby increasing its value.  The Golem user reported a ""strange"" transaction that gained so much value that it could have emptied the entire exchange GNT account, according to Bylica's post. In fact, he only reason this didn't happen, he said, is that the number was so large that it was impossible for the exchange to complete it.  The bug has now been fixed and Bylica’s team has notified other exchanges of the potential vulnerability.  'Shocked and terrified'  Yet, fears were still stoked by the bug, given it could have been broadly applicable to other exchanges using ERC-20 tokens.  Although Bylica's team has not verified the existence of this vulnerability on other exchanges, he mentioned the potential downsides were serious.  ""We were shocked and a little bit terrified to realize the potential consequences of someone taking advantage of that bug for multiple tokens on multiple exchanges,"" Bylica wrote.  Fortunately, some proposed fixes are relatively simple to implement.  ""Simply checking the length of an address provided by a user secures [exchanges] from the described attack,"" wrote Bylica.  Reddit reactions  The reaction on Reddit ranged from mild outrage to debates on exchanges’ responsibility to provide enhanced security.  ""This is basic stuff,"" wrote user BullBearBabyWhale. ""I’m once again amazed how serious business in this space (which is all about security) is not taking it seriously.""  For those storing any ethereum-based tokens, including ERC-20 tokens, on an exchange, Reddit user 1up8192 recommended reaching out to the service providers to see if they had checked for the vulnerability.

To date, Boost VC has backed more than bitcoin 50 companies at the seed level or above.  In this entry in CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin Milestones"" series, Draper gives an overview of 1st July, 2014, the day his father Tim Draper purchased nearly 30,000 bitcoins in the US government's first-ever bitcoin auction.  ""So, should I do it?""  It's 1st July, 2014, and I'm driving to work. I was turning onto El Camino when I got the call from my dad.  ""I'm about to press the button to send in my bid,"" he said.  The week would prove an interesting one in history. Justin Trudeau was sworn in as Canada's prime minister, Chris Stapleton raked in CMAs and it also happened to be the week the US Marshals Service auctioned off 30,000 bitcoins.    ***    Up to that point our industry had a torrid history of scandal and skepticism.  The general masses had only heard that large sums of money had been stolen from bitcoin exchanges or that everyone buys illegal drugs with bitcoin. In fact, the reason that the US Marshals office had the bitcoin was because Ross Ulbricht (aka 'Dread Pirate Roberts') had been captured and proclaimed the leader of the Silk Road, a startup focused on the illegal sale of goods online.  For a while, it was the eBay of buying drugs, guns and hitmen, and the currency used in this anonymous marketplace was the ever-reliable bitcoin.  That's the stigma that stuck to the technology (and that still sticks to this day), and it was everywhere at the time.  I remember being on a panel with my dad [Tim Draper] and grandpa [Bill Draper] in early 2015, in front of hundreds of people. It was the first time we had done a panel where we each talked about our lives as venture capitalists.  When it was my turn to speak, the only thing I said was ""bitcoin"", and as I started to explain why, my grandpa turned and cracked a joke:  ""Well Adam, don't be the first Draper to go to jail.""  Even my grandfather, the most prescient man I have ever known, had a tilted perspective of the bitcoin world. (He also obviously didn't know about my trip to Tijuana, Mexico, in college either).    ***    The sale of the US Marshal bitcoin had the potential to be a major shift in public sentiment depending on the outcome.  This was a government-funded institution that had confiscated digital currency and was auctioning it off in return for cash. This was the government recognizing the validity of bitcoin and using it to generate its own revenue.  If it was only used, or had value for illegal goods, the US Marshals Service wouldn't touch it, no government agency would take a stack of confiscated cocaine and publicly auction it off to the highest bidder.  ""So, should I do it? I'm about to press the button.""  I took a breath and responded:  ""If I had the money, I would. This technology is changing the world.""  He said ""OK"", and hung up.    ***    Looking back, I probably should have hesitated.  I didn't know it at the time, but he was bidding millions to win the whole amount. I assumed he was only bidding for a portion...  The next day I walked into my office, and my co-founder Brayton Williams said, ""Did you hear? All the bitcoin in the auction went to a single person.""  I thought to myself, ""Dad… what did you do?!""  I went upstairs (we work in the same building in San Mateo) and I walked in on an incredible moment. The Vaurum team was in the room, Avish Bhama and Sean Lavine, my dad and my brother were all there. I sat down on the couch looking out to my dad's desk and the open window, he was on the phone with someone.  ""Hey you made it just in time! We are transferring the bitcoin into my wallet!"" he said, my dad’s infinite enthusiasm even more palpable than normal.  I remember looking around and having a feeling of history come over me. I had been working in the digital currency world for 18 months at this point, and I knew that when the history of bitcoin was written, this moment was going to be one of those moments that was spoken about and potentially debated.  That's why what happened next is comical...    ***    So, my dad was on the phone with the US Marshals, who were going to send this super advanced new type of currency over the internet to my dad's wallet. But because it was millions of dollars at stake, they were verbally confirming and reconfirming the wallet addresses.  ""Lowercase Z, seven, capital X, four, five….""  ""Wait… Lowercase C? or Z?""  ""Z as in Zebra.""  ""OK, continue.""  It was analogous to the 'easy' user experience that bitcoin has always had a problem with. They repeated this process four times before they decided that they were sure the address was correct.  ""OK confirmed,"" my dad said. You could hear the voice on the other end say, ""OK, sent.""  And nothing happened. Everyone justified this. They said, 'Well it takes 10 minutes for a confirmation on the blockchain to happen...' Ten minutes went by… nothing.  There were 30,000 bitcoin going somewhere, but it didn’t feel like they were going to the wallet address it was supposed to go to.  Twenty minutes pass. Nothing.  Everyone was getting nervous.  Thirty minutes pass. Nothing.  I left the room just as everyone started to get a little worried.  Sure, it was a historic moment, but I was already a half hour late for my next meeting...    ***    Flash forward, and it took an hour to confirm. AN HOUR!!! (It turns out that the US Marshal didn't give the miners a fee for the transaction, so it wasn't a priority on the network).  But the transaction did go through, and my dad and the US Marshals Service successfully completed a bitcoin transaction that got put into the record books.  And the headlines read: ""Venture Capitalist Steve Draper Wins Bitcoin Auction."" The first article I read called my dad 'Steve'. Hilarious.  ""Tim Draper Wins Silk Road Auction"" was the common title used.  Now, think about what just happened. The US government successfully sold 30,000 bitcoins. Not only that, but a professional investor had won all of them, and not a random professional investor, but a third-generation venture capitalist who had earned respect by being one of the best VCs ever for backing startups like Skype, Baidu and Hotmail.  That is what the world read that day in The Wall Street Journal, Forbes and The New York Times.  The bitcoin community needed a catalyst to change perception, and I believe my dad created it.

Monax is the first Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible blockchain accepted into the ambitious Hyperledger project, a consortium of companies working together to develop standardized blockchain protocols.  The acceptance brings Connecticut-based Monax's protocol under the Hyperledger umbrella, which already includes blockchain implementations like Fabric by IBM and Sawtooth Lake by Intel. The Burrow code will now be published on Hyperledger’s proprietary GitHub page and open to contribution from a diverse set of developers already involved in the project.  The incubation agreement will further allow Monax access to Hyperledger’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the part of the network that complies the bytecode and executes scripts on the decentralized network.  Being accepted for incubation now means that Monax can use the new Apache-licensed version of the EVM, paving the way for the development of more complex smart contracts.  Byrne summarized the plan of action moving forward, stating:  ""In the short term, the biggest change will be the ability for members to contribute toward hardening of Burrow's EVM implementation in order to support production-grade ecosystem applications... In the medium term, we will be working with other Hyperledger projects to ensure that Burrow runs well in combination with various blockchain bases such as Sawtooth Lake and Fabric.""  The development of the Burrow platform is seen as a way to reduce friction among smart-contract platforms by standardizing language at the protocol level and allowing for greater interoperability among different implementations of the ethereum blockchain.  ""We look forward to seeing Burrow help reduce the friction in building sophisticated smart contract based ecosystem applications. We also look forward to the Hyperledger community's expertise being leveraged to harden and improve Burrow's EVM and secure native features,"" Byrne said.  Monax is also a member of the recently announced Enterprise Ethereum consortium.

42379437,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87lKx,1491883791,IBM Ramps Up China Blockchain Work With Supply Chain Trial,"IBM advanced its status as a blockchain leader Tuesday with the launch of a supply chain platform designed to streamline flows among buyers, sellers and financiers in the pharmaceuticals space.  The Yijian Blockchain Technology Application System – built in a partnership between IBM and Hejia, a Chinese supply chain management company – seeks to eliminate some of the financing problems faced by the country's pharmaceutical retailers. Specifically, it targets the country's underdeveloped credit evaluation system, which it argues can make it difficult to raise short-term working capital.  The platform is designed to bring greater transparency into supply chain networks by tracking the flow of drugs, encrypting trading records and offering an easier means of authenticating transactions. The end goal is to reduce the time small retailers must wait to be paid after delivering medicine to hospitals – which currently can be as high as 60 to 90 days.  Overall, Ramesh Gopinath, vice president of Blockchain Solutions at IBM, said that the use case offers an ideal example of how the company's enterprise blockchain platform can smooth multi-party transaction processes.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Blockchain is perfect for the kind of flow that happens between three parties. It's not a random thing, we see a pattern of this appearing again and again.""  Initially, the Yijian system will be implemented on a test basis by one pharmaceutical retailer, one hospital and one bank, but plans are in place to expand in July to create a farther-reaching network.  Leng Tianhui, board chairman of Hejia, emphasized in statements that he expects the platform to be adopted far beyond just the pharmaceuticals sector in China.  Eyes on China  Yet, the Yijian platform's launch also strengthens IBM's positioning in China – it has now rolled out five different solutions in the world's second-largest economy in the last 12 months.  In March, the technology giant announced the creation of a green asset management platform designed to help companies develop, manage and trade carbon assets more efficiently under China’s carbon emissions quota scheme. Further, in January, it teamed up with the Postal Savings Bank of China to launch a blockchain asset custody system.  As far back as 2016, this strategy could already be observed, as IBM partnered with UnionPay – China's largest payment credit card processor – to roll out a blockchain platform facilitating the exchange of user loyalty points in September.  It also launched a pilot in conjunction Walmart to move China’s pork industry supply chain on to a blockchain in October.  Still, Gopinath said that IBM's focus on China is a function of the availability of pertinent use cases and local partners.  ""I wouldn’t calculate this as 'OK, we have a concerted effort to do something in China',"" he said, adding:  ""It's more like there are all these classic, what I would call, great uses cases starting up in different places.""
