42397795,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAUy,1405880736,"BitXatm to Launch 1,000 Bitcoin ATMs in US","Germany-based digital currency bitcoin ATM and point-of-sale (POS) solution provider BitXatm has announced a new partnership that will find the company shipping 1,000 units to the US in a bid to build the country's largest bitcoin ATM network.  For the initiative, BitXatm will partner with Los Angeles-based CryptVision, a startup that itself is seeking to build the largest network of bitcoin ATMs around the globe. As part of the deal, CryptVision will become the exclusive provider of BitXatms in the US and Canada.  Sergey Yesayan, president of CryptVision, framed the move as one that will find the new company moving quickly to gain a foothold in the bitcoin market, saying:  ""In terms of positioning our products all over the country, we're planning to have most of them in place by the end of the year, and are looking for location partners in shopping malls, restaurants and night clubs.""  Yesayan said that the bitcoin ATM units will be available for free to qualified operators, with the qualification process for operators beginning 25th July. CryptVision plans to treat the units as vending machines and manage the associated financial responsibilities and licensing.  The announcement follows BitXatm's May upgrade to its Sumo Pro ATM product, and was issued at The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC), a two-day community event being held in downtown Chicago.  BitXatm courts US market  Launched in April of this year, BitXatm's signature unit – the Sumo Pro – now provides one-way or two-way transaction capabilities in addition to its POS features. The units were on full display at the TNABC, in the country where the company aims to better cater to its biggest market.  Marcel Bruck  , sales director at BitXatm, told CoinDesk:  ""US is the number one market. Bitcoin is erupting and you see that most of our customers are also from America. In Europe, you still have a lot of regulations.""  BitXatms can accept and dispense any digital currency and offers a web-based back end that allows operators to manage profits, cash flow and to change settings on the ATM remotely.  The company said it will continue to provide support for its ATMs to CryptVision once the units are deployed.  TNABC announcements continue  The BitXatm announcement is the latest in a string of major news stemming from the NABC event this weekend.  Spurred by the launch of new bitcoin lobbying group, the Digital Chamber of Commerce, day one of the conference included major announcements from bitcoin wallet and block explorer provider Blockchain and China-based digital currency exchange OKCoin.  To catch up on day one of the NABC, read our full recap here. For breaking news from the event as it happens, follow CoinDesk on Twitter.

42397786,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAO5,1405871719,Sierra Leone Fashion Company Brings Bitcoin to West Africa,"Bitcoin’s potential to succeed in Africa is widely recognized within the industry.  It’s capable of transforming the way we send remittances to the continent and giving the unbanked easy access to money quickly and freely. It’s an alternative currency for anyone, but especially useful in countries with unstable national currencies, and can reduce the cost of cross-border trade.  In Freetown, Sierra Leone, an ethical fashion accessories company called Burehhttp://www.bureh.com/ is taking the first step in creating a digital currency economy for sub-Saharan Africa by accepting bitcoin via payments processor BitPay. That its total bitcoin transactions have been few since it began offering them in December doesn’t faze co-founder Daniel Heyman. Money movement, he told CoinDesk, is the main opportunity in bitcoin – not consumption.  Evidence of bitcoin’s transformative possibilities may be traceable across the continent. South Africa and Kenya certainly have well-established bitcoin economies that continue to progress. But so far, nothing on their level exists in West Africa.  Heyman said that stability and peace across the western region is at an all time high, and that makes prospects rosier for Bureh’s business and its possible role in the bitcoin ecosystem. He said:  “I personally am a big believer in the potential of bitcoin to leapfrog the existing financial infrastructure across sub-Saharan Africa. I'm not sure how quickly this will happen but in five years per se I could see a world where everyone has a bitcoin account tied to a cell phone, even in northern Sierra Leone where our fabrics are made. I could place orders from New York – which I do already – and also make payments.”  Business operations  Bureh launched in 2011. Its accessories are hand-produced in Sierra Leone by well-paid local artisans, said Heyman, and made from traditional fabrics sourced by local businessmen and entrepreneurs. The collection is distributed in Sierra Leone, the US, Europe and China, where it showed this April at Shanghai Fashion Week exhibition. The company, Heyman said, reinvests half of its profits into start-up companies in West Africa to promote entrepreneurship.  Heyman, who oversees his company from New York, said that the business is less susceptible to foreign exchange risk than most. “But our people, our employees, and our contractors are not,” he continued.  When the Sierra Leonean Leone (SLL) weakens against the dollar, Bureh as a business isn’t at risk, as its revenue is mostly in foreign currency, he explained, but that means everyone supplying services to the company suffers.  He said:  “BitPesa in Kenya is an example of the sort of service we would love in West Africa. If we could send money straight to our management team and even employees in Sierra Leone – with lower costs and fewer delays – that would really improve our responsiveness and our ability to manage complex organizations.”  Bureh pays fixed fees when it wires money from the US, said Heyman, but Sierra Leone banks automatically convert US$ into SLL. No specific figures were provided in this interview.  “This is where the majority of the fees are hidden,” he said, “and it's hard to say exactly how much. Unlicensed exchangers offer rates that are regularly five to 8% better.”  Looking to Kenya  BitPesa  , the bitcoin remittance service, and mobile money transfer service M-Pesa, are valuable because they eliminate the risk and uncertainty of fees, conversion rates, speed and fraud.  The global remittances industry is now worth over $500bn a year. In 2012, remittances to Africa alone were estimated at around $60bn.  Heyman said that West Africa has a long way to go if it's going to catch up to Kenya in mobile banking, but that progress is rising throughout the region.  He added:  “I'm not sure Bureh will ever be a major player in the bitcoin space, but at this point we are big believers in its potential to make it easier to conduct business across borders and in places with underdeveloped banking systems.”  Image via Burehhttp://www.bureh.com/",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/20/sierra-leone-fashion-company-brings-bitcoin-to-west-africa,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/58ff5cf4112c6f40d530908a9c64d2f8d1d1c036-480x360.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397800,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAZt,1405855541,Trend Spotting: How to Identify Trends in Bitcoin Price Charts,"Trends play an important role in trading, giving traders a chance to use patterns in the price data to make decisions based on more than simple rises and falls, or worse, gut instinct. But how does one identify and draw a trend on a chart?  When looking at bitcoin price charts like the one below, you can’t help notice how prices at times seem to move along invisible lines:  This can be seen whichever chart timeframe you look at, be it weekly, daily or on a 30-minute chart:  Trend lines and trend channels  The lines you see in the charts above are called 'trend lines'. However, it is apparent that prices not only follow trend lines, they often move back and forth between two trend lines, an upper and a lower trend line:  This is then called a 'trend channel' and it’s probably one of the most widely used concepts in technical price analysis. One important aspect of trends is that they can be divided into shorter trend segments, which again are made of even shorter segments:  Price trends are highly fractal in nature. This mean that they appear very similar, no matter on what time frame (ie: zoom factor) you look at them.  How to draw trend lines and channels  It is fairly easy to draw trends, all you need is an interactive charting platform that allows you to draw on the charts, such as Coinstackr’s Bitcoin Charts or ZeroBlock for example. Using the 'line' or 'channel' tools, do the following:  Drawing uptrends  Uptrends generally respect the lower supporting trend line more accurately, so start the trend line at one of the trend’s lows (see [1]). Then draw the line to one of the next higher lows (see [2]). Depending on the tool used the line will automatically extend to the right and/or left:  Note how the blue moving average indicator on the chart can help you draw the line at a good angle. After drawing the line you will almost always need to move it around a bit and adjust its angle so it touches the trend’s price lows as accurately as possible. Trend lines never perfectly fit prices, however, there will always be some price candles piercing through.  Drawing downtrends  Downtrends are drawn exactly like uptrends, only that you start with the upper resisting trend line:  Advanced tip: Logarithmic charts  Exponential growth  can often be seen in price charts, as shown by Bitcoin’s rally back in October and November 2013:  Exponential curves display as straight lines when plotted on a logarithmic scale. The same price series then looks like this:  Now, trend channels can be used to easily spot exponential growth. However, not all charting platforms offer logarithmic charts.  Using trends in trading  While trends can be useful, it is not advised to use them as the only factor in any entry decision. Even if prices touch the lower trend line of an uptrend and buying into bitcoin seems to make perfect sense, always look for more confirmation from other indicators (eg: other support and resistance key levels, volume analysis, price action patterns) that this trend is not going to break and losing you money.  Ideally, you want to have confluence of more than one indicator to increase the odds in favour of a profitable trade.  Furthermore, don’t forget to always look for higher and lower time frame trends. While it may seem like prices are in an uptrend on one time frame, higher time frames may reveal prices are actually in a downtrend, for instance. Many traders are not comfortable trading against the trend, which is why they rather trade true to the motto 'the trend is your friend'.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Christoph Cronimund,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/20/trend-spotting-how-to-identify-trends-in-bitcoin-price-charts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b52a0441e7b6c9f7589e0b4865b3a44bc9990d05-900x530.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42375635,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9NuV,1405851628,The 9 Biggest Screwups in Bitcoin History,"Do you know where your bitcoins are right now? Hopefully they’re still in your wallet where you left them, but the history of bitcoin is littered with human error, poorly implemented software and heists that would make even the most hardened of Wild West outlaws tip their hat in respect.  Bitcoin is a man-made, open-source technology – not a gift handed down from the heavens. Just to drive that point home, here are the nine biggest screwups in bitcoin history.  9. That time someone hacked 92 billion BTC into existence  On 8th August 2010 bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik wrote what could be mildly described as the biggest understatement since Apollo 13 told Houston: ""We've had a problem here.""  “The ‘value out’ in this block is quite strange,” he wrote on bitcointalk.org, referring to a block that had somehow contained 92 billion BTC, which is precisely 91,979,000,000 more bitcoin than is ever supposed to exist.  CVE-2010-5139  (CVE meaning ‘common vulnerability and exposures’) was frighteningly simple and exploited to the point of farce by an unknown attacker. In technical language, the bug is known as a number overflow error.  So instead of the system counting up 98, 99, 100, 101, for example, it broke at 99 and went to zero (or -100) instead of 100. In layman’s terms, someone found a way to flood the code and create a ridiculously large amount of bitcoin in the process.  The fix was the bitcoin equivalent of dying in a video game and restarting from the last save point. The community simply hit 'undo', jumping back to the point in the blockchain before the hack occurred and starting anew from there; all of the transactions made after the bug was exploited – but before the fix was implemented – were effectively cancelled.  How serious was it? Bitcoin’s lead developer Wladimir Van Der Laan is pretty blunt about it, telling me: “It was the worst problem ever.”  Perhaps, but bitcoiners have seemingly been trying to trump it ever since.  8. Erm, this version of bitcoin doesn’t work with my old one  Think about the amount of money being ploughed into bitcoin: $240m of venture capital funding to date. Now think about the number of people who work full-time on the core protocol (it’s two, by the way). The outcome of this disparity is rather predictable – software problems that would otherwise be ironed out and spotted by a team of well-resourced developers inevitably sneak through.  The most recent major issue occurred when Bitcoin Core version 0.8 was released in March 2013. Put simply, it wasn’t compatible with previous versions.  Remember the terror that accompanied upgrading your old Windows PC because none of the software would work afterwards? That happened with bitcoin.  Version 0.8 allowed for larger blocksizes than older versions could handle. With half the network upgraded and the other half still sitting on version 0.7 or older, the danger was that two versions of the bitcoin ledger would emerge.  As with the 92 billion bitcoin problem, the community sounded the alarm and forced a hard fork back to version 0.7 while the issue was resolved.  Disaster avoided, narrowly. But this wasn’t deep in bitcoin’s early history – this was just over 12 months ago. It’s not for nothing that people are calling for more resources to be devoted to bitcoin’s development.  Ok, that’s probably enough piling on to bitcoin’s core developers – on to everyone else.  7. Mt. Gox. Twice.  I’m going to keep this one short, because we all kind of know the score on this one. Originally founded as a trading card site, Mt. Gox grew to become bitcoin’s largest bitcoin exchange, helmed by French-born Mark Karpeles who unadvisedly wrote all of the site’s code by himself without oversight or review by others.  The outcome of this foolhardy approach to development? In 2011 Mt. Gox was hacked, with the attacker driving the price down to just fractions of a dollar from highs of $30 by mass selling on the platform. Then this year the big one – $340m vanished and Mt. Gox toppled.  In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal  , Karpeles was apologetic, saying that “the weakest point of my company was management” – which is code, for ""me"".  It’s not hard to find people who don’t believe Mt. Gox was hacked and instead think that Karpeles ran off with the cash, but with a police investigation ongoing the truth will hopefully come out and we’ll know for certain just what went on at Mt. Gox.  6. Ever heard of bcc?  The US government's recent auction of bitcoin seized from Silk Road was a landmark in bitcoin's story – as many have pointed out, it gives some small sense of legitimacy to the currency in the sense that the government wouldn't auction off seized cocaine, for example. The US government is willing to deal in bitcoin to some extent, a small but important signal.  But it was also accompanied by its fair share of farce. Before the auction the government accidentally emailed the potential participants but forgot to bcc them, so everyone who received the email could see who else had been emailed, meaning their names were eventually leaked.  Of course this kind of mistake is common – so common that even acclaimed bitcoin developer Amir Taaki made the mistake back in 2012 when he ran Intersango, a UK-based bitcoin exchange that eventually closed down in late 2012 after its banking relationship with Metro Banks turned sour.  The upshot of the US government leak is that the people whose emails were leaked were targeted by scammers, one of whom succeeded in dramatic style. Sam Lee of of bitcoin fund Bitcoins Reserve received an email claiming to be from a media company. The attached document was supposedly a list of interview questions but actually linked to a website prompting Lee to enter his password. When he did, the attacker took over his email and sent a message to the CTO, requesting a transfer of 100 bitcoin. Bye bye bitcoin.  But sometimes, attacks are far, far simpler than this.  5. If I’m messaging you for access to my servers, verify my identity  This isn’t going to be a list of bitcoin heists – oh boy are they fun – but an honourable mention has to be given to Canadian Bitcoins, who were the victim of an old-fashioned social engineering attack that has to go down as one of the easiest ever executed.  Canadian Bitcoins’ servers were being run by a company called Rogers Data Centre (who were technically in the process of taking the data centre over from its previous operator, Granite Networks). A hacker was allegedly able to steal 149 bitcoin, or around $100,000 at the time, from Canadian Bitcoins by messaging Rogers Data Centre and just asking for access to the servers.  That’s it. The hacker pretended to be Canadian Bitcoins CEO James Grant over instant message – just by saying “I am James Grant”, there wasn’t any fancy trickery going on – and was given access. “It’s ridiculous,” the real James Grant was reported as saying in the Ottawa Citizen, who broke the story.  Yes. Yes it is ridiculous. But not nearly as ridiculous as this next issue.  4. The end of auroracoin  Iceland is famous for aggressively prosecuting its bankers for their role in the financial meltdown of 2007/2008. So when auroracoin was announced in February, a cryptocurrency designed to be a national currency for Iceland, the stars seemed to have aligned perfectly.  Just months later, auroracoin is dead and all the hype dead with it.  The currency was ‘airdropped’ to Iceland’s citizens in late March, with 31.8 auroracoin allocated to each citizen who had registered. The few that claimed their coins are thought to have immediately sold them off and the price of the coin never recovered after plummeting on its first day in circulation.  Auroracoin’s fatal blow came from the insecurity of the network – there was little incentive for miners to maintain the network and process the few transactions made with the coin. As a result it was vulnerable to attack from anyone with a modest amount of computing power at their disposal.  Here are two good post-mortems of the entire fiasco, which go some way to casting doubt on the viability of alternative cryptocurrencies. Speaking of which...  3. If you’re going to play with magic beans, at least play with the magic beans everyone agrees have some value  For the last eight years, a bunch of Scottish developers have been quietly beavering away up in Fyfe creating what they see as the future of the Internet – totally decentralized, encrypted and anonymised.  Eight years is a long time to be working on any software project, but this year Maidsafe finally had their big coming out party – a crowdsale to fund the next stage of the project’s development.  But what were they selling, I hear you ask? A temporary cryptocurrency, which will one day be exchangeable for the permament cryptocurrency running on the Maidsafe network. Confused yet? You could only participate in this cryptocurrency crowdsale with bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, mastercoin.  Why risk your crowdsale by allowing people to buy in with a practically worthless cryptocurrency like mastercoin? Nobody has a freaking clue – Kashmir Hill at Forbes has a wonderfully detailed account of this whole situation: “I forgive you if you find it all confusing; so did most of the investment experts I spoke with.”  In the end, Maidsafe still successfully raised millions of dollars, but mostly in mastercoin, which isn't really very helpful when bills need to be paid in fiat, or bitcoin (at a stretch).  2. Never forget: no backsies with bitcoin  What would you say is a reasonable fee to pay to transfer £100? If it was within the UK, you would say there shouldn’t be a fee. If it was an international transfer, you would probably be fine paying a significant percentage, maybe 9% with WesternUnion or much less with new bitcoin remittances companies like BitPesa.  You would probably be bummed if you had paid 8000%, like the owner of this bitcoin address did in September 2013. It’s unclear what caused the faulty transaction fees, but over the course of a few days one bitcoin address added huge fees to its transactions, essentially donating ridiculous sums of bitcoin to miners. One transaction, totalling only 0.01 bitcoin, had an extra 80 bitcoin attached as a transaction fee (for reference, transaction fees are usually around 0.0001 bitcoin).  Something similar happened to this hapless Redditor  , who made a simple typing error back in July 2013, attaching 30 bitcoin to a 38 bitcoin transaction.  In a world where the fact that transactions can’t be reversed is considered by some to be a virtue, accidental transactions are stupidly common. As bitcoin wallet software develops, incorrect transactions might get caught in the same way Gmail catches your email if it has the words “I have attached” when there aren’t any attachments.  But until then, people will continue to accidentally add incorrect transaction fees or even transfer 800 bitcoin to defunct Mt. Gox addresses.  1. That hard drive is never coming back  Of course the award for all time greatest bitcoin fail has to go to James Howells from Wales, who sent £4.2 million to the landfill when he chucked out a hard drive containing the private keys for 7,500 bitcoin.  Coming just a month after the news that Norwegian PhD student Kristoffer Koch had bought himself a house after discovering an old hard drive with 5,000 bitcoin on it (which he paid only $27 for in 2009), James Howells' landfill story felt especially painful.  There are many many more stories like these. Too many to include in one piece, but let us know your favourite stories of bitcoin woe in the comments below.
