42411560,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOoUW,1642549071,The House Looks Into Crypto's Energy Impact,"A House committee will take a look at crypto and its energy requirements this week. It’s another congressional look at crypto.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Yet another crypto hearing  The narrative  Crypto’s energy use has been under scrutiny for quite a while. We’re going to hear from U.S. lawmakers about the issue for the first time in years on Thursday, when the House Energy and Commerce Committee hosts a hearing titled “Cleaning Up Cryptocurrency: The Energy Impacts of Blockchains.”  Why it matters  Lawmakers have been talking about energy and environmental concerns around crypto mining.  Breaking it down  So full disclosure: I used to cover climate and climate issues. Climate change is certainly a real one. We can see that in the polar vortexes of years past, in the disintegrating sea ice in the Antarctic, in derechos in the American midwest.  Environmental concerns around crypto are nothing new. The University of Cambridge’s Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index estimates that the Bitcoin network currently uses around 15.7 gigawatts (or about 12 time traveling DeLoreans) (1 gigawatt = 1 billion watts). For comparison, my laptop uses around 65 watts.  And a reminder that this is just bitcoin (BTC). There's several thousand other cryptocurrencies with their own varied energy needs.  Part of the hearing seems likely to focus on the environmental impact of running all of these miners.  “According to research on PoW cryptocurrencies’ carbon footprint in 2020, a single [ether] transaction added more than 90 pounds of CO2 to the atmosphere, while a single BTC transaction added more than 1,000 pounds of CO2 to the atmosphere. Based on estimates of 2021 emissions, ETH mining emitted more than 22 million tons of CO2 and BTC mining emitted more than 56.8 million tons of CO2. To put this in perspective, the global 2021 CO2 emissions of ETH and BTC mining is equivalent to the tailpipe emissions from more than 15.5 million gasoline powered cars on the road every year. Other estimates put these figures much higher,” the hearing memo said.  The memo cites Digiconomist and Statista in determining these figures, though crypto advocates argue that per-transaction energy estimates are misleading because transactions don’t actually work quite that way.  Still, the general point is clear: Lawmakers will be wondering about these emissions, and, in turn, the mining facilities used to power these networks.  “The profitability of mining and the increase of the value of [proof-of-work] cryptocurrencies over time supports massive investments in mining facilities, which require ever-increasing amounts of energy to power and cool machines,” the hearing memo said.  We’re also likely to see a focus on consumer impact. One of Thursday’s witnesses is Steve Wright, the former general manager with the Chelan County Public Utility District in Washington state, once a popular destination for crypto mining firms.  The entire board of commissioners then voted to stop reviewing applications for new miners due to concerns about how much energy these miners were using and the potential for them to catch fire or otherwise harm the local community.  At least one local bitcoin mining firm based in the area also declared bankruptcy.  Other witnesses include Brian Brooks, the former Acting Comptroller who currently helms crypto mining firm BitFury; micro datacenter chief John Belizaire; Jordan Ramis PC shareholder and onetime government official Gregory Zerzan; and Cornell professor Ari Juels.  To be honest, I don’t have a clear sense of how this hearing will play out yet. The seeds are there for a substantive conversation, though, and I’ve suspected for a year now that climate and energy issues will play into the crypto world so it’s really about time.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  President Joe Biden nominated Sarah Bloom Raskin to be the Federal Reserve’s Vice Chair for Supervision, as well as Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson to serve as governors on the Fed’s board. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Governor Lael Brainard also sat for their nomination hearings last week, where they were grilled on a number of issues ranging from inflation to central bank digital currencies.  Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) also asked about the Fed’s lack of response so far to Wyoming’s request that its state-chartered special purpose depository institutions be granted access to Fed master accounts. It’s still unclear when or whether the Fed might make a decision.  Elsewhere:  Crypto Firms Can't Outrun the ‘Travel Rule’: Marcus Pleyer, the president of the Financial Action Task Force, penned an op-ed explaining the intergovernmental watchdog’s “travel rule,” which asks countries to impose common know-your-customer rules on crypto exchanges worldwide.  House and Senate Agriculture Committees Issue Bipartisan Call for CFTC Guidance on Crypto: Lawmakers in the House and Senate Agriculture committees are asking the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to explain its role in regulating crypto.  Outside CoinDesk:  (Bloomberg) Russian law enforcement officials have shut down the REvil ransomware group, seized various currencies (including an unspecified amount of cryptocurrency) and arrested ransomware attackers, including a suspect believed to have been involved in last year’s Colonial Pipeline attack, Bloomberg reports.  (The Washington Post) The Washington Post spoke to aspiring Democratic lawmakers about their work with crypto in the lead-up to this year’s pending election.

Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin and ether go down and then up; altcoin prices are mixed.  Technician's take: BTC appears oversold into the Asia trading day, but upside remains limited.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $42,463 +0.8%  Ether (ETH): $3,166 -1.3%  Top gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cardano ADA +9.1% Smart Contract Platform Litecoin LTC +4.0% Currency  Top losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM −7.9% Smart Contract Platform Chainlink LINK −7.2% Computing Polkadot DOT −7.2% Smart Contract Platform  Markets  S&P 500: $4,577 -1.8%  DJIA: $35,368 -1.5%  Nasdaq: $14,506 -2.6%  Gold: $1,813 0.3%  Market moves  Bitcoin couldn't make up its mind in Tuesday trading. It started the day with a short downward spiral that had its price headed for $41,000. But then it changed course. By the end of trading in U.S. equities markets, it was on its way to where it began the day, above $42,000. At the time of publication, the largest cryptocurrency in market capitalization was trading above $42,500, up slightly for the day.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, followed a similar pattern, sinking and then rising. At the time of publication, it was trading about $3,150, approximately flat over the past 24 hours. The other leading alternative coins (altcoins) varied with a few gaining a tick and others off slightly.  The mixed performance reflected ongoing nervousness about the U.S. and global economies. Major stock indicators fell with the S&P 500 off 1.8% and the Nasdaq down 2.6% as investors looked to exit companies that are losing money. Bond yields rose amid widespread fears that the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates faster and more steeply than expected.  ""Bitcoin seems poised to continue to trade as a risky asset and remains vulnerable to growing fears over aggressive Fed tightening,"" OANDA Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya told CoinDesk by email. ""The surge in Treasury [bond] yields may continue this week, and that could test some bitcoin hodlers and altcoins.""  But Moya is optimistic about a bitcoin price rebound. ""The breakout in Treasury yields was not expected to happen this quickly, but when it ends that could be the all-clear signal for many traders to scale back into cryptocurrencies,"" he said.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Drifts Lower; Stuck Between $40K Support and $45K Resistance  Bitcoin (BTC) has traded in a sideways range over the past week, although buyers continued to hold support around $40,000. The next level of resistance is between $43,000-$45,000, which could limit short-term price gains.  BTC is roughly flat over the past 24 hours as most technical indicators remain neutral into the Asia trading day.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is the most oversold since Jan. 7, which preceded a 10% price bounce. In a downtrend, however, price reaction to oversold readings could be delayed by a few days.  For now, sellers remain in control as long-term momentum signals weaken.

42423901,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hnth,1642546975,DeFi’s Wonderland Is Buying TIME,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Wonderland saw its TIME token briefly drop below its treasury-backed value on Monday, prompting the team to buy back millions worth of TIME tokens to bolster the price.  Wonderland falls within a category of popular DeFi projects known as “Ohm forks,” experimental protocols with aims of creating an independent monetary system. Yesterday’s incident appears to be the first time an Ohm fork has stepped in with buybacks, perhaps the crypto version of central banks carrying out quantitative easing.  On Monday afternoon, the price of TIME plummeted 40% from $1,400 to $832 within a span of two hours before protocol leaders intervened to stabilize the token’s price.  As TIME breached the $1,000 threshold, the sell-off prompted the unwinding of overleveraged traders, which led to a liquidation cascade and further price decline.  The incident shows that volatile market movements can cause a treasury-backed token to fall below its intrinsic value. The phenomenon is akin to how an exchange-traded fund or close-ended fund can trade below its net-asset value (NAV) in traditional financial markets.  In response to the price action, pseudonymous Wonderland protocol co-founder 0xSifu said the protocol purchased millions in TIME tokens to bring the price back in line with its treasury-backed value.  “It looks like we finally have an opportunity to test the buyback promise at Wonderland,” wrote 0xSifu on Twitter. “Several million has once again been used to buy below our backing price, returning the price to our intrinsic value.”  As of Tuesday afternoon, the price of TIME rebounded to roughly $1,300 per token. However, the token remains down 65% year-to-date and down 91% from its all-time high of $14,185 last November.  Wonderland’s Sifu said in the project’s Discord channel that the team would “continue to buy above backing price to prevent cascade” and would “strive to improve our response time” if the price were to fall below the backed value in the future.  A decentralized monetary system?  Wonderland launched in September 2021 as a fork of Olympus on the Avalanche network. Within the broader crypto community, participants in the Wonderland ecosystem affectionately refer to themselves as “frogs” or “frog nation.”  According to its white paper, Wonderland is a “decentralized reserve currency protocol that owns its own liquidity,” an idea that was first pioneered by the popular DeFi protocol Olympus.  The central idea of the project is to create a stablecoin that is not pegged to the U.S. dollar or any other fiat currency, which are subject to the decisions made by central banks. Instead, the value of the reserve currency would be backed by a pool of crypto assets held in the protocol’s treasury, similar to the notion of a gold-backed dollar.  As of Tuesday afternoon, the Wonderland treasury contained nearly $1 billion in non-TIME crypto assets.  The project has also ignited a fierce debate in the cryptocurrency community surrounding Olympus and its various forks – with one camp labeling the schemes as Ponzis and the other lauding its goals of creating a truly decentralized monetary system.  Read more: Olympus DAO Might Be the Future of Money (or It Might Be a Ponzi)  Whether the projects will succeed in their stated goals remains to be seen.  In recent weeks, Olympus and its various forks have suffered steep sell-offs, with Olympus’s OHM token declining 65% year-to-date and KlimaDAO, another Ohm-fork, seeing its KLIMA token declining 72% year-to-date, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING | ZRX,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/18/defis-wonderland-is-buying-time,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/627c204607a4b891abd73523301d31b8f3118ba2-1500x1128.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423913,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hoNh,1642540734,"Market Wrap: Cryptocurrencies Decline With Equities, Traders Remain Cautious","Most cryptocurrencies traded lower on Tuesday as rising bond yields continued to weigh on U.S. equities. As investors reduce their appetite for risk, the most speculative areas of global markets have been hit the hardest.  For example, the Nasdaq 100 is down about 5% from its all-time high, compared with a 4% drawdown in the S&P 500 and a roughly 37% drawdown for BTC. Government bonds, deemed to be a traditional safe haven investment, are also selling off as yields rise. The iShares 20+ year Treasury bond exchange-traded fund (NASDAQ: TLT) is down nearly 17% from its recent high.  Still, despite the global market rout, bitcoin's spot trading volume is at its lowest level in six months. The ""extended fearfulness, together with the recent low volatility, may have made traders hesitant to make moves,"" Arcane Research wrote in a report.  Derivative traders, however, have made some cautious moves recently. Leverage in the bitcoin futures market is skewed to the bearish side. That means short traders, or those positioned for continued price declines, could be forced to unwind their positions if BTC's price begins to rise. A rapid unwind could result in high volatility.  ""The premier cryptocurrency is not growing because of the inaction on the part of retail and most importantly, institutional investors to stack up on the coin,"" Alexander Mamasidikov, co-founder of mobile digital bank MinePlex, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. Therefore, bitcoin's revival could depend on large investors returning at current or lower price levels despite macroeconomic headwinds.  Latest Prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $41758, −0.94%    ●Ether (ETH): $3122, −2.83%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4577, −1.83%    ●Gold: $1814 per troy ounce, −0.14%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.86%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Short-term accumulation  The chart below shows a rise in addresses holding 0-100 BTC over the past month, indicating an accumulation of bitcoin by small accounts. Large holders (addresses holding 100-100,000 BTC), however, remained on the sideline as the price of bitcoin continued to decline in December.  ""It’s easy to see retail accumulation (small accounts) as a positive sign, as it means retail buyers are re-entering BTC,"" Delphi Digital, a crypto research firm, wrote in a blog post. However, ""the lack of whales (large accounts) increasing their BTC holdings could suggest there’s more blood to come,"" Delphi Digital wrote.  Retail traders tend to sell quickly, which means the recent accumulation could be short-lived, especially if BTC fails to hold current price levels. Therefore, a sustained price increase will need stronger conviction by large bitcoin holders, similar to what occurred in previous bull runs.  Fund outflows continue  Investors pulled money out of cryptocurrency funds for a fifth straight week, reflecting the bearish market mood as bitcoin suffered one of its worst-ever starts to a year.  Digital-asset investment products saw $73 million of outflows during the seven days through Jan. 14, according to a report published Monday by the crypto firm CoinShares. Read more here.

42411542,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOnnX,1642539086,Is Crypto a Ponzi? Define 'Ponzi',"If you can believe it, scams and Ponzi schemes have existed and thrived in the cryptocurrency industry well before the recent speculative exuberance around decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and token launches on blockchains like Binance Smart Chain. For sure there are a lot of sketchy “profile pic” projects (PFPs) and questionable economic games played using smart contracts, those lines of code that supposedly cut out the middlemen from basic financial services. So, you know, do your own research.  Thankfully, some crypto projects make it easy for you. In 2014, Ponzi.io launched. It promised 1.2 times returns paid in bitcoin on deposits as little as 0.0001 BTC. “Get rich off the world's first open Ponzi scheme!” the project’s website advertised. To say nothing else about it, Ponzi.io is guilty of false and deceptive marketing; it wasn’t even the first self-evident Ponzi.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Just as these schemes have long thrived in crypto, there have also been commentators willing to go out on a limb, risking libel and alpha capital gains, to dismiss the entire blockchain-based industry as fraudulent. Last month, Robert McCauley, an economist at Boston University, wrote an op-ed stating, “Bitcoin is worse than a Madoff-style Ponzi scheme.”  His case? People buy bitcoin with the expectation of a profit. Because bitcoin is a “zero-coupon perpetual” rather than a “income-generating” digital asset, the only way to profit is to “cash out” to someone else – the salutary greater fool. Bitcoin is worse than your everyday pump-and-dump penny stocks for McCauley. If the economic project fails, it’s not just zero-sum for investors who lose their money, but “negative-sum” for society because of bitcoin’s steep power bill.  While McCauley’s prediction that Bitcoin might collapse is a bit histrionic, it’s not totally out of the question if one is fair-minded. He’s off-base, however, in stating that mining bitcoin “represents a real cost” for the world. It’s simply not for any individual to decide what power switches to flip on or off in a free market, especially given that many people willingly enter into the economic arrangement of securing this largest of decentralized, digital monetary networks (sometimes profitably).  Still, you can’t fault the man for using the P-word. Major crypto media companies, “thought leaders” and informed users of crypto platforms often throw it around. Hardcore bitcoiners have called everything from BitPay to Brave “scams” simply for trying to get people to spend their bitcoin or earn crypto for using a browser. That “Ponzi” has been picked up by critics as a cudgel is crypto’s own doing.  See also: NFT Scams: How to Avoid Falling Victim  Jake Chervinsky, the head of policy at the Blockchain Association, thinks this is detrimental branding.  “You're using the term ‘Ponzi’ to mean an economic game with built-in investing incentives & high risk of implosion,” he said. “When regulators hear ‘Ponzi,’ they think it means a fraudulent scheme in which a criminal deceives victims to steal their money.  “This term is doing massive damage,” Chervinsky tweeted Monday.  With all due respect to the newly hired policy lead, I think the term is actually a useful heuristic for describing much of this industry’s activity. As Chervinsky notes, crypto projects are “Ponzi-like” in that they often incentivize early participation in a project with the promise of a return. That’s a broad definition, but these behavioral incentives are widespread.  As a reporter, I find that there is value in speaking with economy, clarity and honesty. ""Ponzinomics"" is a term that has come up in the industry because it accurately captures much of what goes on. It's why people ""ape in"" to protocols, and even the mindset behind ""hodling"" bitcoin.  There should absolutely be more of an effort to draw a distinction between actual scams and legitimate efforts, but the term is what it is and, again, there shouldn’t be language policing of free markets. I advocate the use of softer words: “Ponzi-like” or “Ponzi-esque"" because we're rarely ever discussing the real deal.  “Ponzi scheme” has a well-established definition. As McCauley noted, in 1920, Charles Ponzi guaranteed 50% returns on 45-day investments. Early investors profited from fresh incoming capital before the entire plot collapsed less than a year in. Bernie Madoff ran the same game, the longest such scheme we can all agree on, before the Great Recession hit and redemptions halted. The key is that there is no legitimate economic activity, just a terminal perpetual-motion machine.  DeFi protocols like Ohm, which “Ohmies” described as a Ponzi, are based on continuing adoption, a constant stream of money. But it was also trying to build a new ""backbone"" for DeFi, reportedly. The use of ""Ponzi"" was self-conscious – it gets directly at the greed needed to prop the project up and the latent “network effects” to take hold.  I like the term because it’s frank. It advertises that these schemes are risky, that the social factors are never guaranteed and that the technology is immature. If you get involved in Ohm's Ponzi, you should be prepared to lose it all. I also appreciate how the term has evolved – as language always does – to connote not just a broader range of activity but also a prevalent sense of economic malaise.  See also: America, Let's Try Optimism This Thanksgiving | Opinion  Pseudonymous host of the “Crypto Critic” podcast Cas Piancey (someone I hope I’m on good terms with) took offense when CoinDesk’s stalwart DeFi reporter Andrew Thurman (a friend) used the term to describe both Ohm and the U.S. dollar. Greenbacks don’t fit into the standard definition of a “Ponzi scheme,” but using the term gets at the realities of the modern economy. Please do a quick Google search of the “Cantillon effect,” the process by which those closest to the money printer benefit the most. Look at the latest consumer price index figures and S&P 500 returns over the past 18 months and tell me that there isn’t a class of people who haven’t benefited most from the government’s pandemic response. Is the dollar a Ponzi? No. Is it Ponzi-like in this scenario? Well, I can see why some would say that.  No doubt there are some who will read this and see an argument against government spending, or a defense of people getting scammed. But you can use a word without agreeing with it. Saying that crypto is Ponzi-like can be purely descriptive, without value judgment, and emotive.  It’s not a pitch-perfect term. Crypto deviates from the historic definition of a Ponzi scheme in several important ways. Jacob Franek, a core contributor to Alliance DAO and co-founder of Coin Metrics, delineated this.  Crypto, apart from the flat-out scams, will always have a free-floating price mechanism because these assets trade in free markets rather than in a financial black box designed by a Madoff or Ponzi, he said. So, early investors don’t necessarily profit – like Satoshi who left his coins untouched or the many paper hands who sold too soon. Later investors can buy at an “advantaged position,"" and profits are not paid out solely on the backs of new investors.  Read more: Olympus DAO Might Be the Future of Money (or It Might Be a Ponzi)  Ponzinomics is a term with cultural currency because it shows how crypto is speculative, a gamble, an economic ""game of chicken,"" to use Franek’s phrase. There's a sense that over-saturation of the term might let sketchier projects through. ""Scam"" is used just as flippantly, and scams litter the industry.  Does that bastardize a well-known phrase? Does it normalize undesirable market activity? Might people get hurt later on?

The latest structured-finance alchemy from the crypto industry allows traders to get exponential returns on the price of ether (ETH), already one of the world's most volatile assets.  Last week, the decentralized options protocol Opyn launched an ether derivative contract linked to a new index called Squeeth – a word play on “squared-ether.” The index tracks ether’s price change, raised to the power of two. It takes leverage to the exponential degree.  There's even a token for that: Traders can take bullish exposure to the Squeeth index by purchasing oSQTH on the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Uniswap. The token, which is designed to track the index, is configured for the Ethereum blockchain under the widely used ERC-20 standard.  The basic purpose of the new tool is to give traders exposure similar to the highly leveraged bets they could get from trading options, but without the need to set strike prices or determine contract expiration dates, according to a Jan. 9 blog post by Wade Prospere, head of marketing and community at Opyn.  Squeeth turns the options trade into a perpetual contract and can be used as a hedge, Prospere told CoinDesk. On the long side – betting on price upside – the trade offers leverage without liquidations. Traders who take the short side – betting on prices to stay range-bound – can collect premium yield, he said.  “The ideal market condition to hold Squeeth is when a trader has conviction in the upward price movement of ETH in the short- to mid-term,” Wade Prospere, head of marketing and community at Opyn, told CoinDesk.  One contrast is with the ETH-2X flexible leverage index – a structure product offering 2X leverage where traders simply get double the underlying returns; think exponential versus geometric; a two-times or ""2x"" multiplier turns a triple into a sextuple; but a ""squared"" return turns a triple into a nonuple.  Holders of Squeeth will make more when ETH goes up and lose less when ETH goes down.  Say a trader purchases $1,000 worth of the Squeeth tokens. If the price of ether triples from $3,000 to $9,000, the Squeeth would go up triple-squared, or 9-fold – to $9,000 in this example. On the contrary, if ether halves to $1,500, Squeeth will see a less-than-linear decline, as represented by the curved payoff line below:  A key drawback is that Squeeth funding rates – the cost of holding long positions – are expected to be higher than a 2x leveraged position due to the product’s exposure to pure convexity. The constant funding bleed from the long position results in the oSQTH’s underperformance relative to the Squeeth index.  So far the product has received a warm reception from the crypto community, according to Opyn.  ""On day 1, we saw huge Squeeth trading activity,” Opyn CEO Zubin Koticha told CoinDesk in an email. ""There was huge buy-side demand.""  ""Because of this, more people were trading Squeeth than ETH-2x flexible leverage index, even though that pool is 6x bigger,” Koticha added.  In cryptocurrency trading, it's all about the x's.  Uniswap has seen over $12 million of the oSQTH tokens change hands since inception. Further, the ether-Squeeth liquidity pool (ETH/oSQTH) on Uniswap has raked in $6 million in total value locked – the most commonly used metric to measure the size of collateral invested in decentralized finance protocols. Traders providing liquidity receive fees, according to the official blog.  There is no free lunch in finance  While Squeeth provides a significantly higher upside than other instruments, it also charges a relatively high funding rate – a fee longs pay shorts for maintaining the bullish exposure.  In the ""perpetuals market"" – a widely adopted crypto-markets innovation designed to give traders easy leverage – long traders pay funding to short traders when the perpetual contract trades above the index price, and vice versa. The funding mechanism is designed to help keep the perpetuals price tethered to the price of the underlying asset.  Those costs still exist with Squeeth, but they're a bit tougher to see: The equivalent market price of oSQTH almost always trades above the Squeeth index, implying a premium – a de facto cost for traders who are going long.  At press time, the estimated funding rate was 0.29%. It doesn't sound like a lot, but that's a daily rate, so over the course of 365 days, compounded, the annual rate works out to about 65% – a costly vig that can eat into returns over time.  As such, the product is better suited for traders anticipating a big rally in a short period. Even Opyn's executives are quick to point out the dynamic.  “Holding a long Squeeth position for an extended period (> 1 year) during which ETH trades sideways or goes down in value will likely cause a loss in ETH-squared exposure of the long Squeeth position due to in-kind funding paid to short Squeeth sellers,"" Opyn’s Prospere told CoinDesk.  Simple as that, right?  Simulations run by Opyn, assuming constant volatility and funding rate, to illustrate the impact of in-kind funding, show that while the Squeeth rose 90-fold in the year to November 2021, the oSQTH token tracking the index rose 50-fold (graph below).  Blockchain security researcher Mudit Gupta said the product is ""great for short-term trades, as it offers higher upside and lower downside.""  According to Joseph Clark, a mechanism designer at Opyn, Squeeth can also be used as hedge along with ether derivatives on the decentralized exchange Uniswap V3.  Shorts prone to liquidations  While the constant in-kind funding collected from long positions ensures there are no liquidations due to margin calls, traders with short positions are still liable to having their bets forcibly closed out.  Traders shorting Squeeth are effectively short the oSQTH token and long ether collateral. That’s because they first need to deposit ether on Opyn’s platform as collateral – in order to mint the oSQTH tokens before shorting them on Uniswap. These traders earn a funding rate for taking on this position, paid by Squeeth holders.  If ether’s price suddenly were to jump, the margin call required to keep the squared short position fully collateralized would exceed any increase in the value of the ether collateral – leading to liquidation or forced closure of the short position by the protocol.  ""Large daily moves in the ETH price become much larger when they are squared,"" Prospere said. ""If the ETH price is increasing, users could need to top up collateral to avoid being liquidated.""  At the recommended collateralization ratio of 200%, the ideal market condition to short Squeeth is when traders are convinced that the market is overpricing future price volatility – in other words, when the traders see fewer wild price swings ahead than in the prevailing views of the market.  So selling Squeeth is a bet on lower volatility. Of course, that doesn't mean it won't be volatile trading Squeeth itself.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | UNI | ZRX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/18/opyns-new-squeeth-raises-ether-trading-to-the-power-of-two,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92e2e1f96dc5a3b8760bffb8165c853571279a4c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Digital-asset investment products saw $73 million of outflows during the seven days through Jan. 14, according to a report published Monday by the crypto firm CoinShares. The redemptions accumulate to $532 million over the five weeks, cutting industrywide assets under management across all funds to $56.1 billion.  Investment funds focused on bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, accounted for $55 million of the outflows. Ethereum-related funds saw outflows totaling $30 million.  However, the report noted that on a daily basis, for the first time this year, there were inflows on Wednesday and Friday of last week.  “This is suggesting the bearish sentiment is beginning to abate after recent positive price moves,” according to the report.  Recent price action still looks relatively dour, with bitcoin down 2.5% in the last seven days, trading around $41,000, and ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, down 3.5% at $3,100.  Going against the trend was Solana, the layer 1 blockchain protocol, apparently an investor favorite with inflows totaling $5.4 million.

42423902,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hnxh,1642536514,Damien Hirst Launches Chainlink Price Index for NFT Project,"Damien Hirst’s first non-fungible token (NFT) collection is getting a dedicated price index courtesy of Chainlink, a crypto network and data provider.  When Hirst – the British artist best known for wildly expensive works involving taxidermied sharks and diamond-studded skulls – released “The Currency” last year, the project took most of its cues from other popular NFT collections. Like CryptoPunks or the Bored Ape Yacht Club, “The Currency” consists of 10,000 images with slight variations. And as with those projects, it was valued partly according to its “floor,” or the lowest listed price for a single NFT in the collection.  Now, a new price index will offer another metric for valuing the project based around Chainlink’s “oracles” – essentially a way of providing off-chain data to crypto networks. Often, they’re used to collect price data for cryptocurrencies. (Chainlink offers data feeds for Ethereum, Bitcoin and other popular coins.)  Hirst’s new price index feeds recent market data into an algorithm and spits out a “robust” price estimate for “most of the non-rare NFTs in the collection.”  Joe Hage, the founder of the tech company HENI, which has partnered with Hirst, said “The Currency” has always been an attempt to make art feel a little more like money.  “It's about the relationship between art and money and value, and how art itself can be used as a store of wealth, and even as something you can use as a currency,” he told me.  The hope is the new price index will make that connection even more explicit, connecting these digital artworks with the world of DeFi, or decentralized finance. With a hard valuation for tokens in “The Currency,” Hage said he expects NFT holders to start borrowing against their pieces.  “The inventive and helpful nature of the community is constantly inspiring me and blowing my mind.”  Though the structure of Hirst’s project resembles that of CryptoPunks, the similarities are only skin deep. Each work in “The Currency” is a digital representation of a physical painting.  Only the NFTs are for sale, but by the end of this coming July token holders will need to decide whether they’d like to own their NFT or the corresponding physical painting.  Choose the token and the painting is destroyed; choose the painting and the token is burned. Until then, all 10,000 physical editions are being stored “in a vault in the U.K.""  In an email, Hirst said that even though he stepped into the crypto world “a bit blind” last year, he’s been happy with how the project has turned out.  “It’s an experiment for me as much as anyone else, and the greatest joy for me is that there’s continuous activity and excitement in the community,” he wrote. “The inventive and helpful nature of the community is constantly inspiring me and blowing my mind.”  The floor for the collection is currently 5.05 ETH, or over $15,000.",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | ETH | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/18/damien-hirst-launches-chainlink-price-index-for-nft-project,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8b321080e4fb7a2b7f02c634f1259a79d3e0408-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Federal Security Service (FSB) raided 25 residences tied to REvil, seizing approximately $6.8 million in various currencies – including cryptocurrencies. The FSB also seized computer equipment, crypto wallets “that were used to perpetrate crimes” and 20 luxury cars, according to a Jan. 14 press release.  The FSB said the arrests were carried out at the request of “US authorities.”  U.S. President Joe Biden has been pressing Russian authorities to act against REvil and other Russian cyber criminals since last summer, when REvil demanded $70 million in bitcoin payments after hacking Miami-based software provider Kaseya. Russia has been slow to take action. Last week’s arrests are the first time – at least publicly – that Russian authorities have acted against one of the many ransomware groups based in Russia.  It is also the first time in years that U.S. and Russian intelligence agencies teamed up on a cyber crime operation. A few observers of U.S.-Russian relations have highlighted that the timing of the arrests coincides with Russia’s escalating efforts to invade Ukraine.  A White House official speaking on the condition of anonymity told reporters last Friday that the U.S. did not consider the arrests to be related to the ongoing events in Ukraine.  Russia’s motives for tackling REvil aside, the arrests are part of an uptick in global collaboration against ransomware gangs. Last year, Romanian, Kuwaiti and South Korean authorities independently arrested suspected members of REvil-affiliated hacking groups.  The momentum has continued into this year.  On Jan. 17, Europol announced that it had seized 15 servers belonging to VPNLab.net, a virtual private network provider that catered to cyber criminals and ransomware gangs, rendering the company’s virtual private network (VPN) services inoperable.

Around 30% Of Total Bitcoin Supply Is Now Underwater As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the percentage of BTC supply in profit has now fallen off to just 70%. The &apos;percent of supply in profit&apos; is an indicator that measures the percentage of the total Bitcoin supply that&apos;s currently in the green. When the value of this metric increases, it means more coins have started to get into profit. This leads to holders becoming more probable to sell their coins in order to harvest their gains. At very high values of the indicator (more than 95%), the price of Bitcoin has usually approached a top as profits are realized. On the other hand, when the metric moves down, it means more coins are entering into the red. Below certain low levels, investors may capitulate to cut their losses. However, when more than 50% of the supply is underwater, bottoms have historically formed.

42423898,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hnph,1642531152,Bitcoin Miners’ Margins Are Still ‘Quite Healthy’ Even After Recent Sell-Off: D.A. Davidson,"Bitcoin miners are still generating healthy profits, despite the sharp sell-off in crypto prices and an increase in the network hashrate, Wall Street investment firm D.A. Davidson’s analyst wrote on Tuesday.  “Since the late-October peak, hash price ($/TH/day) has fallen from over $0.40 to just $0.22 today yet gross margins remain quite healthy, around 85% down from 91% at peak,” analyst Christopher Brendler wrote.  He also noted the gross margin numbers are based on the specification of “industry-standard” S19 Pro mining machines. When a more efficient miner, the S19 XP, comes online, the margins would go to over 90% at today’s hash price.  Brendler noted that the sell-off in the mining stocks has been because of a combination of bitcoin prices falling and investors' sudden change in risk appetite.  However, Brendler is still bullish on the miners as he believes their valuations have overcorrected while their fundamentals remain “excellent.” He thinks the weakness in bitcoin price should force inefficient miners out of the market.  On Jan. 10, Jefferies said the slump in bitcoin’s price from November’s all-time high is hurting the shares of the crypto mining companies, but might nevertheless be positive for them because it will deter new entrants to the space.

42423899,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hnrh,1642527515,Bank of America Says UK CBDC Would Be More Than a Digital Form of Cash,"Bank of America (BoA) is challenging the Bank of England's assertion that a U.K. central bank digital currency (CBDC) would act just as a form of digital cash, saying it's more likely to replace checking accounts as the way in which consumers hold the majority of their funds.  The BOE sees a possible CBDC – referred to colloquially as Britcoin – as fundamentally a substitute for cash, BoA says. ""Such a construct could [however] potentially be a 15x bigger amount replacing £440 billion ($598 billion) of current accounts not just £30 billion in cash,"" it wrote in its research paper ""Digital Money in the U.K.""  The BOE has yet to decide whether to develop a digital pound. Its most recent move was to establish two forums in September last year to explore the key issues around a CBDC. The U.K. central bank has said that should it proceed, the earliest a CBDC could be rolled out is the second half of this decade.  Given that consumers hold only small amounts in cash, there would be greater convenience in switching a current account into Britcoins, BoA said. That could be an area of concern for commercial banks. Checking accounts, or current accounts as they are called in the U.K., are the lifeblood of commercial banks' business models, providing them with stable funding over a long term.  ""This makes the BOE assumption that users would only substitute a digital sterling for their cash holdings a risky one for banks,"" BoA said, referencing concerns recently aired by the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee in its report exploring a potential U.K. CBDC.  That committee described it as inevitable that consumers would transfer money from their bank accounts into CBDC wallets.  'Rebundling' money  BoA concludes that Britcoin would represent a ""rebundling"" of money. Should consumers hold substantial amounts in a Britcoin wallet, banks would not be able to rely on the stability or duration of checking account deposits. Nor would they be able to cross-sell products such as credit cards and mortgages as effectively as they do now.  In extremis, this could bring about a restructuring of the institutional framework of finance, BoA says. The report describes how holding money in a bank is safer than holding it in a non-bank – such as payment providers checkout.com or Wise – because bank customers have access to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which guarantees deposits up to an amount of £85,000, something non-banks largely lack.  However, should a non-bank provider offer a wallet that can store Britcoin, it would be at least as safe an option as a checking account. Possibly more so, given that Britcoin would be central bank money.  ""The BOE, in its analysis, ascribes fleeting reference to the potential move of transactional relationships out of banks,"" according to BoA. ""If these went to a third-party provider, we consider that the high value savings balances tied to current accounts would automatically become less stable for the bank as well.""  Commercial banks would then be at risk of losing both the funds and the relationship of their customers.

42423910,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hoFh,1642523947,BSN’s Red Date Behind Shenzhen-Singapore Trade Blockchain Project,"Singapore and China’s Silicon Valley, the city of Shenzhen, are building what is likely the world’s first blockchain-based network for a cross-border trade data exchange between two major economies.  Red Date Technology, the architect of China’s internet of blockchains, is working under a smart city MoU between the Shenzhen Municipal Government and Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to build the blockchain-based Transnational Trade Network (BTTN), Red Date CEO Yifan He told CoinDesk.  Using the BTTN, companies will be able to transfer trade data between countries and firms, while adhering to local data privacy and security laws, according to a white paper shared with CoinDesk.  The project is another example of how Chinese companies, with Red Date in the lead, are working to make their closed technology information system interoperable with the rest of the world’s open protocols.  Much like with the Blockchain Services Network (BSN), Red Date envisions the BTTN as a fundamental piece of the future global blockchain architecture. The BTTN could expand into “a multilateral network” that will “comply with data laws in any jurisdiction and support information security in any cross-border trade scenario,” the white paper said.  The data cooperation project comes as China implements draconian data security and privacy laws. The Data Security Law, which came into force in September, has reportedly hampered the ability of Chinese companies to share data with overseas partners and customers.  Based in Beijing, Red Date has been branching out after the BSN, a platform where developers can build and deploy blockchain decentralized applications, caught headlines around the world.  The BSN has the backing of two state-owned telecoms, China Mobile and China Unicom; payments provider China UnionPay; and the State Information Center, a think tank under the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China’s top economic planning agency.  How does it work?  The current systems companies use to share data during cross-border trade are disjointed. In the CoinDesk interview, He brought up the example of bills of lading (BoL). Every country or even port has its own system for keeping track of BoLs, and so a cargo ship traveling across borders will need to connect to multiple application programming interfaces (APIs) to submit the documents.  Read More: Meet Red Date, the Little-Known Tech Firm Behind China’s Big Blockchain Vision  The BTTN wants to solve that problem by connecting trade partners on a private network of “data highways,” so that they only have to connect to the network, He said.  The BTTN is made up of data centers that can be set up by installing the BTTN software on a cloud server. These are connected via blockchain-based data highways, called business chains.  Data center operators are responsible for network membership, security and compliance. That is different from the BSN where the consortium of companies pitching into its development, the Development Alliance, manages the data centers, He explained.  Firms can exchange data across jurisdictions by plugging into the data centers and then using the business chains. The chains can be built on different blockchains, both permissioned and permissionless, such as Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and Quorum.  The network offers system-level services as secure document transfer via IMDA-developed blockchain tool TradeTrust, decentralized identity verification and decentralized data storage to support the data exchange.  The China dimension  Just like with the BSN, Chinese companies won't have access to permissionless chains, which allow anyone to join, to comply with Chinese regulations. Using the BSN’s interoperability technology, the BTTN will allow for permissioned and permissionless chains to interact.  Chinese data centers, like the one in Shenzhen, will host “a corresponding permissioned system-level chain for each public chain,” the white paper said. One such chain is dubbed the “Ethereum Access Chain.” With that, Chinese firms will be able to pay for gas in fiat currencies, while a permissioned chain records data to comply with Chinese law, the paper said.  These built-in cross-chain capabilities ensure that regardless of how or where individual businesses build their networks on the BTTN, they can continue to transact with others globally in compliance with local regulations.  One of the key goals of the proof-of-concept stage is compliance with the Data Security Law, He said. At present, authorities have “no idea how to control” Chinese IT systems that connect with global systems for trade, the CEO said.  The BTTN data centers can work as gateways through which data passes to go overseas, making it possible for the government to easily assess whether a firm is compliant with Chinese data regulations. “Without this type of highway, everybody can connect to wherever they want to connect to. There is no way to even manage that,” He said.  Given these monitoring capabilities, He expects provincial branches of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s highest internet regulation body, to set up BTTN data centers.  Red Date is talking with three different provincial CAC branches, including those in Chongqing and Hainan, He said.  Next steps  The infrastructure is based on the existing BSN architecture, and Red Date has already started charging data center operators, He told CoinDesk.  The transaction goes through China Mobile, and the BTTN technology is sold as a China Mobile product that uses Red Date technology, He said. This makes it easier to work with government clients in China, he said.  In its initial phase, Southern Electronic Ports, a branch of China’s electronic port system, will set up a data center in Shenzhen and BlockAsset Management will set one up in Singapore, which will integrate with the IMDA-operated TradeTrust system.  The China Center for Urban Development, a branch of the NDRC, Tencent’s licensed neobank WeBank, logistics supplier LinkLogis, and GovTech Singapore are also participating in the project.

42411839,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgaOQ,1642523740,NFT Scams: How to Avoid Falling Victim,"If you Google “NFT scams,” the results will likely lead you down a rabbit hole filled with, in some cases, actual cartoon rabbits.  Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have exploded into a multibillion-dollar sector of the crypto industry in the last 12 months alone. Top collector’s items, such as rare pieces from the Cool Cats and Bored Ape Yacht Club collections, trade for upwards of $30,000 or more.  If five- and six-figure price tags seem like a lot for a JPEG, NFT creators have a one-word answer for you: utility. Because NFTs create an indelible digital record of your ownership on the blockchain (aka the same tech on which crypto is minted), owning a digitally tokenized piece of art can also serve as your membership ticket to exclusive online clubs, gaming communities, Discord chat rooms and interactive experiences.  At least, that is, in theory. But in practice, NFTs are still new and a little messy. While blockchain enthusiasts consider them an exciting signal that mainstream crypto adoption is on its way, NFTs create some pretty lucrative opportunities for scammers due to the pure volume of money exchanging hands.  Ahead, we dive into what the most common NFT scams are, how to avoid them and why they’re becoming so frequent.  Common NFT scams (and how to avoid them)  Phishing scams and suspicious pop-ups  To buy your first NFT, you’ll need to sign up for a wallet that transacts on the Ethereum blockchain. MetaMask is perhaps the most popular Ethereum wallet for NFT collectors. However, MetaMask users were recently targeted in a phishing scam involving phony advertisements that asked for users’ private wallet keys or 12-word security seed phrases (a big red flag). There are also fake malicious pop-ups operating via Discord, Telegram and other public forums that link to normal-looking login pages, such as MetaMask or other popular websites.  If a bad actor gets a hold of your private information through a phishing attempt, they can drain all of the crypto in your digital wallet.  How to avoid these scams  As a general rule of thumb, you will only need your seed phrase when creating a hardware backup of your crypto wallet or when recovering your wallet. Never enter information into the MetaMask pop-up, or any other pop-up while you’re at it. Always go directly to the verified website for any crypto transactions, never using links, pop-ups or your email to enter your information. Write your seed phrase down on paper, and never give it out to anyone – don’t even store a photo of it in your phone.  Catfishing and fake personas  Because NFT sales happen virtually, and all marketing is done on social media, it’s easy to get catfished. Popular NFT communities commonly hire influencers and celebrities to promote them, making it difficult to tell which ones are real or not.  How to avoid these scams  If you ever receive a direct message from someone who claims to be a founder, celebrity or influencer, don’t respond. It’s commonly known etiquette in the NFT world that C-level staff will never DM you unless you send them a message first or you come to a specific agreement in a public Twitter thread or Discord channel. It’s kind of like when you were young and your parents told you never to give information to a telemarketer who called your house. The same thing applies in the NFT world – if someone DMs you first, don’t click links or reveal any secrets.  Pump-and-dump schemes  Pump-and-dump schemes are unfortunately becoming somewhat predictable in the crypto and NFT worlds. The term refers to when a group of people buys up a bunch of NFTs or currency and artificially drives demand way up. Once they are successful, the schemers cash out when prices are high and leave those who weren’t in on it behind with worthless assets.  Similarly, you may also have heard of “paper money” in reference to NFT projects that aren’t technically scams but have limited liquidity thanks to a handful of aggressive buyers.  “When you have 5,000 NFTs that are being controlled by 20 of the top collectors and none of them have any pressure whatsoever to sell, essentially anyone who wants to buy into that collection has to buy in at a very high floor price,” said a pseudonymous NFT collector known as Whale Shark, who owns over 400,000 NFTs. If you’re buying NFTs as an investment, odds are better when the project has more buyers and therefore more liquidity.  How to avoid these scams  Check the history and wallet records of whatever project you’re interested in. This is where blockchain’s transparency comes in super handy. On OpenSea or any NFT marketplace, view the number of transactions and buyers for the NFT collection. With EtherScan, you can see all incoming or outgoing transactions that happen on the Ethereum blockchain.  Also, follow the project on Twitter and join its Discord channel. For a project to have good liquidity and/or lasting community or artistic value, there should be a good number of engaged investors and collectors, plus an active community where people talk, engage and share information.  Bidding scams  Bidding scams happen mostly in the secondary market after you’ve purchased your NFT and you want to resell it to the highest bidder. Once you list your NFT for sale, bidders might switch up the cryptocurrency used without telling you. Instead of receiving 5 ETH (roughly $15,000 to $20,000) for your favorite NFT, you could get $5.  How to avoid these scams  Double-check the currency used and never accept a lower bid than what you want.  Counterfeit or plagiarized NFTs  It’s worth remembering that minting a piece of artwork as an NFT is not the same as having intellectual property (IP) ownership of it. Thanks to OpenSea’s beginner-friendly software, anyone can turn any photo or image into an NFT whether or not they own the rights to that IP. Scammers and bad actors could easily steal an artist’s work and open a fake OpenSea account where they list counterfeit artwork for auction. This would make your NFT essentially valueless once the community finds out what that scammer is up to – and there’s no way to get your money back.  How to avoid these scams  Before buying an NFT from any marketplace, do your research to make sure the artwork you are buying is from a verified account. Look for the blue check mark next to the artist’s profile picture on OpenSea or other NFT marketplaces. If there is none, find the artist on Twitter or through their website or other social media channels. Ask them directly if the artwork you want to buy is theirs, and if you have the right user profile. Also, see if the artist or NFT project has a Discord channel and ask others in the community.  Watch out for counterfeit blue checks. A true verified account shows a blue check on the border of the profile image, not on the inside. See this example from an NFT scam quiz (which we highly recommend you take) developed by Curious Addys' Trading Club. The second example is the correct one.  Untrustworthy storage sites  This is another ethical gray area, not so much a scam. NFTs can go missing once you purchase them. That’s because the contract that lives on the blockchain (the NFT) is different from the actual artwork. For example, say you were to upload an mp3 file of original music to a platform like OpenSea. When a collector is ready to buy it, they place a bid and pay you in ether, which will then create a record of ownership known as a smart contract.  The smart contract is what actually gets minted on the blockchain. But the file you uploaded (aka the content and the metadata) is separate. It sounds abstract, but remember that NFTs are just about the ownership of an asset, but the asset itself could be anything.  Therefore, if you store the artwork, house deed or other digital content that came along with the smart contract on a centralized platform, make sure it is a trustworthy one. And don’t buy an NFT that merely links to a URL with an image. Whatever page or artwork is stored on that URL can be changed any time without your permission, leaving you holding a token that essentially points to nothing.  Bottom line  If you buy an NFT, make sure you also take possession of the tangible or digital asset (in the form of a JPEG, mp3 or PDF file) outright.  The ultimate way to avoid NFT scams  New scams are always storming the NFT scene, which is why you can’t go it alone. The best way to avoid existing and new NFT scams is to stay informed, and that’s where finding fellow NFT enthusiasts becomes imperative.  Your NFT journey might start with self-education, said Denise Schaefer, co-founder of the crypto education platform Surge. But eventually, you’ll hit a wall and get overwhelmed – and that’s when you’ll need to rely on more experienced collectors and creators you relate to.  “As I started researching by myself, going down the rabbit hole, there were two issues that quickly became apparent to me that I wanted to help fix,” Schaefer said.  ”Number one, I felt that there wasn't a lot of easily accessible and easily digestible content out there. And the other one was that the space felt very male-dominated.”  If you’re new to NFTs and feel unsure where to begin, check out resources like Surge, which has a free Discord channel for women and non-binary people who want to get started creating and collecting NFTs, or Curious Addys' Trading Club, a crypto community for newcomers.  “It's been amazing to see the speed at which things are growing,” Schaefer told CoinDesk. “We have a newsletter now, and we've created our Discord, which is a safe space for women.”  Inside the Surge Discord channel, you might encounter somebody who has never made a Metamask wallet before getting advice from somebody who's running a decentralized finance (DeFi) organization, Schaefer said.  “It's really great to have people of all levels helping each other in their journey,” said Schaefer.  Why are NFT scams so common?  “Essentially, NFTs right now are in the ICO [initial coin offering] stage,” said Nelson Merchan Jr., co-founder and CEO of blockchain PR firm Light Node Media. “Anybody can basically hire an artist to create a specific number of NFTs and then create a lot of hype with crypto influencers.”  This “hype” makes it difficult to discern who in the NFT space is a trustworthy creator and who is a bad actor, especially when so many NFT collectors and creators now use popular cartoon NFT profile pictures (PFPs) and anonymous names on Twitter.  And it’s not just crypto newbies who face risk: Merchan, a crypto investor since 2017, has owned NFTs from the popular Pudgy Penguins collection since it dropped in July 2021. Now facing what some outlets are calling a coup, Pudgy Penguins founders are under scrutiny from angry collectors who claim the project failed to deliver on its promise of creating an in-depth virtual game.  “People are [creating] these NFTs, and spending between $50,000 and $60,000 – sometimes even less – then making a million dollars in NFT sales if they really hit it right,” Merchan said. This leads to an issue of governance and transparency because once an NFT creator or community founder makes a $1 million promise, collectors naturally expect them to follow through.  “They're paying themselves very handsomely,” Merchan said. “But then the value of the NFT itself is going to basically zero. There's no trading, no game and barely a community. They have a sizable treasury fund, but an absolute failure of a project. And that is very worrisome.”  But are these types of projects the same thing as scams? Time will tell, Merchan said.  “When the market turns on everyone, which I think is still going to take some time, these people are going to be considered basically criminals because [collectors] spent all this money on their NFTs, and they're basically worthless now. What are [the founders] going to do with that money? Are [they] going to give it back? Did [they] spend it?”  In addition to the ethical gray areas of NFTs, there are also a number of known NFT scams where the bad actors are very clear – and the losses quite real. So stay alert, make the most educated decisions you can and never invest more than you can afford to lose.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/nft-scams-how-to-avoid-falling-victim,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ffe62b5aae4268cbd0352d800caad8121a9809bb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company said the feature should be available to all U.S. Cash App users, except those in New York State, in the coming weeks.  The integration of the network will allow Cash app customers in the U.S. to send bitcoin for free within seconds to anybody in the world.  The Lightning integration is made possible by the Lightning Development Kit created by Spiral, which is funded by Block.  Cash App customers will also be able to send bitcoin to any compatible wallet that accepts Lightning Network payments, without being charged fees.  Almost three years ago, Block CEO Jack Dorsey, who’s also an investor in Lightning Labs, said there were plans underway to integrate the scaling technology with Square’s Cash App.  Since then, the Lightning Network has progressed significantly, with developers working to make the technology more usable for more people. The network received a boost from the November activation of Taproot, the biggest change to Bitcoin in four years, which allowed new privacy improvements to be made to Lightning.  In November, Dorsey announced he would step down as the CEO of Twitter, but he remains the CEO of Block.

42411835,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgaBC,1642519870,What Is a Crypto Airdrop?,"Crypto users that frequently interact with new and existing platforms will likely receive an airdrop at some stage. Airdrops involve blockchain-based projects and developers sending out free tokens to members of their communities as part of a broader marketing initiative.  The main idea is to send newly minted tokens to hundreds or thousands of different wallet addresses with the hope recipients will be more inclined to engage with the corresponding project – even if it’s only to learn how to cash out the free tokens into something else.  This concept is similar to finding a free discount card in your mailbox to encourage you to visit a new store in the area. However, a crypto airdrop isn't predominantly about making the recipient spend money but rather raising awareness for new projects and services.  In most cases, a crypto airdrop is issued to users in exchange for completing a certain task. These tasks often involve things such as:  Following an account on social media.  Sharing or retweeting one of their posts, including hashtags.  Sending or receiving a transaction (using a particular crypto platform or wallet).  Creating an account and signing up to receive updates.  There are also instances when a crypto airdrop may be issued to users without needing to do anything, as we will highlight below.  Why do crypto airdrops exist?  The primary reason for organizing a crypto airdrop is to promote a blockchain startup, project or service. By issuing tokens to users, the team can bootstrap its project and ensure a fair distribution of tokens among its community from day one. Moreover, recipients of these tokens are incentivized to increase awareness and help the project reach a broader audience once the token begins trading on an exchange. The more interest surrounding the token, the more likely it will rise in price.  Airdrops often gain traction by promoting the launch on a project's website, cryptocurrency forums and social media. This is no different from receiving a HelloFresh voucher in your email with a discount code, as those campaigns are designed to bring more people to the platform through a financial incentive.  Legitimate crypto airdrops will never ask users to make any investment. Instead, it is a way to stand out among competitors that have pursued external funding before issuing their tokens.  How do crypto airdrops work and are they safe?  There are multiple ways to conduct a crypto airdrop:  Have users complete one or multiple small social tasks to qualify for receiving the airdrop at a later date.  Automatically distribute tokens to holders of a particular asset or balance on the blockchain where the airdrop will occur. (For instance, every address with a balance of 0.01 ether or higher gets the airdrop.)  Taking a blockchain snapshot at a previous date and letting users claim their airdrop tokens from the project's website through a smart contract.  Despite their popularity, however, crypto airdrops aren’t always as risk-free as they seem.  Read More: 4 Ways to Stay Safe in Crypto  Because recipients receive ""free money"" in their wallets, there will be airdrops that are nothing more than pump-and-dump schemes. More specifically, the creator issues a token and hopes there will be enough hype surrounding it to have it listed on an exchange. Once tokens begin trading, the creator sells their sizeable portion of tokens, crashing the price.  Another potential attack vector is the so-called dusting attack. A scammer will send a small amount of cryptocurrency to an unsuspecting user to erode their privacy. Then, the attacker will track down the transaction activity of the wallet tokens distributed to de-anonymize the person or company operating the wallet.  Finally, since airdrops are considered income by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, it means whenever you received an amount of “free tokens” you’ll actually need to pay tax on them – whether you wanted the airdrop in the first place or not.  Read more: Crypto Tax Guide For U.S Citizens  Examples of crypto airdrops  The cryptocurrency industry has recently seen a few crypto airdrops that took users by surprise.  OpenDao’s airdrop of SOS tokens rewarded all non-fungible token (NFT) creators, collections and enthusiasts who had previously made transactions on the OpenSea NFT marketplace. Recipients did not have to complete any task other than manually claiming the token from the website. The airdrop helped OpenDao grow its Twitter following to over 60,000, and more than 120,000 addresses claimed the token.  A similar initiative came from the Gas DAO, which issued the GAS token on the Ethereum blockchain. Anyone who ever paid $1,559 or more in gas fees on Ethereum was eligible for the airdrop, with tokens claimable via the website. More than 57,000 addresses claimed the airdrop. The GAS token provides voting rights in the Gas DAO, which aims to be the voice of the Ethereum network's active users.  The third example is the LOOKS airdrop orchestrated by the LooksRare team. Users with over 3 ether in transaction volume on OpenSea between June 16, 2021, and Dec. 16, 2021, were eligible for LOOKS tokens after listing an NFT for sale on the LooksRare marketplace. Users holding the LOOKS token receive a share of the trading fees generated by the LooksRare platform. Additionally, users can stake LOOKS to earn more tokens.  How can you become eligible for a crypto airdrop?  As a crypto airdrop is primarily designed for promotional and marketing efforts, it can be tricky to ensure you are eligible for future events. Every airdrop has individual requirements to assess eligibility, although most of them are easy to find. An airdrop involving a blockchain snapshot is often communicated after the fact, making qualification difficult. However, there are other options to explore:  Find dedicated crypto airdrop websites (you will usually get a notification via email) - similar to signing up for promotions from a store you regularly buy from.  Check social media for the #airdrop hashtag and see if anything new has happened.  Be an active user of different cryptocurrency services, products, platforms and blockchains.  Explore cryptocurrency-related forums and news portals for mentions of a recent or upcoming airdrop.  The main requirement for receiving crypto airdrops is having a cryptocurrency wallet with a balance. One can't receive or claim an airdrop without having a wallet address. Using an exchange address is convenient but not suitable for airdrops. Instead, users should look into the various cryptocurrency wallet solutions they can use to store their funds. MetaMask is one of the most popular wallets to use.

Hubble will use the capital to expand its team and DeFi project offerings.  Investors in the funding round included Three Arrows, DeFiance Capital, Delphi Digital, Digital Currency Group (the parent company of CoinDesk), Crypto.com Capital, ParaFi, Jump Capital, Decentral Park Capital, CMS, Spartan, DeFi Alliance and Mechanism Capital.  “We are thrilled to back the Hubble team as they build core DeFi primitives for the Solana ecosystem, from a decentralized stablecoin to an innovative borrowing marketplace to under collateralized lending. These are critical components of the Web3 financial stack on one of the most prominent networks in the crypto market,” said Matthew Beck, director of investments at Digital Currency Group, in a press release.  The funding round comes a month after Hubble Protocol announced a $3.6 million seed round that included Three Arrows and Delphi Digital among the investors.  On Jan. 28, London-based Hubble will launch the first phase of its development, a zero-interest borrowing platform that mints USDH, a new stablecoin.  The Hubble Protocol is based on Solana, the blockchain that tackles scalability issues by combining proof-of-stake and proof-of-history consensus methods to support a high volume of transactions per second.  Hubble’s future plans include developing under-collateralized lending services. The company also plans to become a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

While the volume of Solana’s NFT market remains a good way behind its Ethereum counterpart, its total market capitalization recently passed $1 billion, according to data from Solanalysis, with Metaplex fueling much of the growth.  The company says its protocol has been used to create over 85,000 projects and 5.7 million NFTs since its launch last June, according to a press release.  “We believe the metaverse will be open, censorship-resistant and globally accessible,” Sergey Vasylchuk, director of the Metaplex Foundation, said in a press release. “In this metaverse, Metaplex will serve as a common protocol and NFT standard to empower the next wave of decentralized commerce, social and gaming experiences.”  The company shook up its corporate roster in September with the hiring of a new CEO, along with a slew of new board members.

42411848,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgasB,1642508723,Can You Still Mine Bitcoin and Other Crypto From Home?,"Over a decade ago, it used to be incredibly easy to mine bitcoin from home. You could simply cobble together a few gaming computers, or silently tap into your school or office’s infrastructure, and mine so much bitcoin that you would be set for life – provided you had diamond hands (never sold), sold at the right times or didn’t throw your hard drive away.  Despite one in a million exceptions like the bitcoin miner who managed to mine a block solo in January 2022, such crazy times are now a distant memory. The Bitcoin network has become so huge that mining operations with entire warehouses full of powerful, custom-purpose mining machines now compete against each other to earn block rewards. But there are ways in which cryptocurrency mining can still be profitable for the average person – and not just from bitcoin. In this piece, we’ll show you the tools you need to calculate your odds of turning a profit and which coins are best.  Read More: What is Bitcoin Mining Difficulty?  Is it profitable to mine bitcoin at home?  Bitcoin was the world’s first globally accessible cryptocurrency to popularize mining – the process of using computational power to generate a winning code (known as a hash) before anyone else in order to be selected to add a new block to the blockchain. In exchange for their effort, each successful miner is rewarded with newly minuted cryptocurrency and any fees attached to the transactions they include in the new block. This type of blockchain validation system is known as “proof-of-work.”  Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  When you mine a cryptocurrency, you need to be mindful of the liabilities that will cut into your profits: namely, bitcoin’s market price, the cost of electricity, maintenance fees and the cost of your mining equipment and how long it is likely to stand up against increasingly powerful miners. As more powerful machines reach the market, your once-powerful machine might not be able to keep up.  Profitability calculators, like those on Nicehash, help you determine whether your operation is likely to make or lose money. To run through an example, let’s operate on the assumption that you don’t have a hydroelectric dam at your disposal but are relying on the U.S. power grid’s average residential rate of $0.1411 per kilowatt-hour.  If you are mining bitcoin using one of Nvidia’s newer graphics cards, like the RTX 3080, you’ll generate $139 a month in bitcoin, according to Nicehash. As of January 2022, the RTX 3080 costs about $1,400.  If you are using a purpose-built AntMiner S19 Pro, Nicehash claims that you’ll turn a projected daily profit of $17.79. However, a single S19 Pro miner will cost you about $10,000, and it’s only good for mining bitcoin. Electricity costs eat up almost half of your revenue for the Antminer 19 Pro.  Because the price of bitcoin is so volatile, it’s impossible to guarantee you’ll be able to make your money back on an RTX 3080 graphics card in 10 months, or 25 months for the S19 Pro mining rig. At press time, the price of bitcoin has fallen about 10% in the past week alone.  The network difficulty, which determines how difficult it is (in computational terms) to mine new bitcoin, is also volatile. Following the crackdown on crypto mining in China in July 2021, network difficulty plummeted by 28% making it much easier for remaining miners to discover new blocks. However, this was short-lived and has since almost returned to previous highs.  Mining benefits from scale, and home miners generally stand to extract less profit per miner than a professional mining company. To cover their costs, professional mining outfits often flit between jurisdictions with cheap electricity, broker deals with local power grids, produce electricity themselves and toss away out-of-date mining hardware at a startling rate.  What coins are profitable to mine at home?  Still, there are plenty of other options for the weekend tinkerer to mine cryptocurrencies at home. Unfortunately, there are so many options and variables that it’s difficult to construct accurate comparisons.  There are some truisms: after a certain point, it is generally more efficient to mine bitcoin rather than ethereum with computer chips as opposed to using graphics cards, as Ethereum strongly favors graphics processing unit (GPU) miners. Though this won’t be the case for long, as Ethereum is phasing out miners ahead of its migration to a ""proof-of-stake"" blockchain system.  Sourcing the mining hardware itself also continues to be a major problem. In the bull run of 2021, the GPU market went crazy, making top graphics cards near impossible to buy at market value. To make matters more confusing, some networks, like Chia, rely on hard drives rather than graphics cards or computer chips, causing some to point the finger at Chia mining for the hard drive shortage of 2021.  That said, some profitability calculators like CoinWarz are illustrative in showing the ratio of profitability, assuming that your hash power – the amount of computational power you’re using to mine a cryptocurrency – is constant. Using a hardware budget of $1,000, CoinWarz ranks the following coins as the most profitable:  Ethereum  Peercoin  Bitcoin Cash  Bitcoin  Ethereum Classic.  At an electricity rate of $0.411 per kilowatt, CoinWarz’s calculator claims that a thousand dollars worth of hash power will generate $20.94 a day of ethereum, more than double the $9.63 that mining ethereum classic would produce.  Small coins – those with less competition from other miners – might be more profitable. However, since the prices of smaller coins are generally more volatile than established coins, the value of your returns is far less predictable.  Whattomine predicts that by using three Radeon RX 480 cards, you will turn a daily profit of $1.21 mining firo, $1.07 mining ravencoin and $0.9 mining sero.  Alternatives to mining solo at home  If you’re interested in increasing your chances of reaping mining rewards, you can also consider participating in a bitcoin mining pool. This involves joining forces with other miners to increase your odds of discovering new blocks and generating a profit – but it also means you’ll be splitting the returns.  Finally, if you don’t have the computing power at home, you can look into cloud mining and weigh the pros and cons of outsourcing your hardware needs.

Police from Anhui province's Chizhou city conducted the investigation, which led them to three suspects in the Sichuan, Hunan, and Guangdong provinces.  Police also seized ""tens of millions"" worth of luxury cars and villas that the police said were bought with illegally obtained funds. The suspects eventually confessed to the crime, the police said.  China issued its sternest ban to date on crypto trading and mining in September, looking to banish activities that it deems to be dangerous to retail investors and the economy.  In June, an investor lost RMB 590,000 that he had invested in a crypto token, when the project owners siphoned the money, shut down the website and were unreachable, Chizhou police said. Hundreds of investors lost RMB 50 million in the scam, the post said.  The investigation found that the suspects were transferring investor funds without the investors' consent to an ""anonymous pool"" where it was laundered, according to the post. The project had successfully passed a security audit, but had actually deployed different code that included a back door, the post said.  Investors lost $2.8 billion through rug pulls in 2021, a report by intelligence firm Chainalysis said.

""Futures markets remain a powder keg for short-term volatility with Perpetual Futures Open Interest at ~250,000 BTC- a historically elevated level,"" blockchain analytics firm Glassnode said in a research note published on Monday.  An above-250,000 BTC open interest has coincided with volatility spikes in the past. ""Since April 2021, this has paired with large pivots in price action as the risk for a short or long squeeze increases, resolved in market wide deleveraging events,"" Glassnode added.  A futures contract is the obligation to sell or buy an asset at an agreed-upon price on or before a specific date. Perpetuals are futures with no expiry. Open interest refers to the number of contracts traded but not liquidated with an offsetting position.  Abnormally high open interest indicates excess leverage – funds borrowed to amplify returns from the trade. In such situations, the market becomes vulnerable to liquidations and resulting price turbulence. Liquidations refer to the forced closure of long or short positions by exchanges due to margin shortage. These lead to exaggerated price moves, as seen several times over the past 12 months.  As a standalone indicator, open interest doesn't conclude directional views on the market but only indicates the amount of money allocated to derivatives.  However, open interest coupled with funding rates or the cost of holding long/short positions in perpetual futures reveals the market's bias. A positive funding rate means longs pay shorts for bullish exposure, while a negative rate implies payment from shorts to longs.  Per Glassnode, bitcoin's funding rates recently dipped to negative territory. This, coupled with high open interest, suggests leverage is skewed to the bearish side. So, if bitcoin continues to move sideways, the funding payment would become a burden for shorts, and they may decide to unwind their position, leading to volatility on the higher side.  Similarly, a move higher can also lead to forced liquidation of shorts, which, in turn, could yield more volatility.  Bitcoin was last seen trading near $41,970, representing a 0.6% drop on the day. The leading cryptocurrency has been restricted to the narrow trading range of $40,000 to $44,000 since Jan. 7, CoinDesk data shows.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/18/bitcoin-may-soon-wake-from-slumber-derivatives-data-indicate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/545542e79af5ba9ff06f9f5b6d1ac68944d13d3b-1920x1271.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The rules will increase consumer protection at the same time as they encourage innovation, the Treasury said in a statement Tuesday.  The Treasury published a consultation response, saying that proposed legislation will also provide the U.K. financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), with the power to regulate the crypto market more effectively.  The government began consulting on a proposed framework for regulating crypto promotions in 2020. Since then, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has stepped in to ban misleading advertising on a number of occasions.  Last year, the ASA banned what it called a “socially irresponsible” bitcoin ad while a group of crypto firms received warnings on crypto promotions. Earlier this month, the regulator banned two ads by Crypto.com saying the company was encouraging people to buy bitcoin with credit cards.  A notable exception to the proposed rules is mention of the blockchain, which is considered not an asset but an underlying technology.  “While most cryptoassets currently use distributed ledger technology (DLT), it might be that this changes as the technology and industry evolve,"" the consultation response said. ""Therefore, the government proposes to remove the reference to DLT from the definition of qualifying cryptoassets.”  While the number of crypto users in the country is on the rise, “public understanding of cryptoassets is declining with only 71% of those who have heard of cryptoassets correctly identifying its definition,"" according to the document.

Bankhaus von der Heydt was formed in 1754 and has in recent years become one of the first regulated institutions in Germany to offer digital asset services.  The German bank offers cryptocurrency trading and custody, the latter through technology provider and crypto unicorn Fireblocks.  The planned purchase forms part of BitMEX's strategy to create a one-stop shop for regulated crypto products in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. It follows the launch of BitMEX Link in Switzerland, a brokerage service offering featuring spot, structured products and over-the-counter trading.  The transaction is subject to approval by BaFin, Germany's regulator for banking and financial services. Following completion, Bankhaus von der Heydt will continue to function as a standalone entity and BitMEX CEO Alexander Höptner and CFO Stephan Lutz will join the supervisory board.

Leveraged crypto markets are now weakening as the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks look to slow their balance sheet expansion and prepare the markets for interest rate hikes, the bank’s head of cryptocurrency research, Sheena Shah, wrote in a report published last week.  Retail investor sentiment on social media has also started to turn less bullish since late last year with the recent downward price momentum also contributing to the bearish sentiment, the bank said.  Morgan Stanley notes that bitcoin’s market capitalization has tracked the growth of global money supply since late 2013.  The yearly change in money supply peaked in February 2021, while bitcoin’s annual growth rate topped out a month later in March, which the bank sees as no coincidence.  Cryptocurrency’s usage as a payment vehicle/exchange of value is what should drive its valuation in the long run. However, the market has been trading most cryptocurrencies like speculative risk assets, as evidenced by the correlation between bitcoin and equity markets in the last six months, the report said.  Blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock said last week that bitcoin’s correlation with M1 money supply has risen to 0.77, suggesting a strong statistical relationship between the two.

42396192,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1Wqb,1642498682,BIS Chief: Central Banks Are Best Sources of Trust in Money in a Digital Age,"Central banks are the institutions best placed to provide trust in money in the digital age and will continue to be, according to Agustín Carstens, general manager at the Bank for International Settlements, an umbrella group for the world's central banks.  “The soul of money belongs neither to a Big Tech nor to an anonymous ledger,"" Carstens said. ""The soul of money is trust.”  Central banks are the key institutions for providing trust, and alternatives have often ended badly, he said. He was speaking at Goethe University’s Institute for Law and Finance (ILF) conference on “Data, Digitalization, the New Finance and Central Bank Digital Currencies: The Future of Banking and Money"" on Tuesday.  He pointed to digital innovations such as stablecoins, which are tech company-issued cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to assets like the U.S. dollar, and decentralized finance (DeFi), which offers financial services without intermediaries, as exciting developments but ones that can potentially fragment the monetary system without the necessary oversight.  “It is undesirable to rely solely on private money. Paying with a Big Tech global stablecoin might be convenient. But in doing so users may be handing the keys to our monetary system over to private entities driven primarily by profit. Such an arrangement could erode trust,” Carstens said.  Carstens also pointed to recent BIS research that argued the promised decentralization in DeFi services is an illusion. According to the report, blockchain consensus mechanisms have a tendency to concentrate power, which makes it easy for a small number of stakeholders to make big decisions.  “DeFi is subject to the same vulnerabilities present in traditional financial services,” Carstens said. These vulnerabilities include high leverage, liquidity mismatches and connections to the formal financial system that could affect that broader system's stability.  Carstens offered some plausible scenarios for the future of money. In one, a few big tech corporations will provide financial services to all. In another, a decentralized system could replace people and institutions with “blockchains and algorithms.”  He also offered a third possibility: One of an open, global monetary and financial system that harnesses technology for the benefit of all.  “In a third scenario, incumbents, big techs and new entrants compete in an open marketplace that guarantees interoperability, building on central bank public goods. End users can seamlessly interact across different providers – both domestically and across borders,” Carstens said.  Carstens said central bankers must work with other public authorities and private stakeholders to make that third version a reality.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/18/bis-chief-central-banks-are-best-sources-of-trust-in-money-in-a-digital-age,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8918673497c7c73378a9a1201acdb2bd162aad0-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Under the new program, the number of tokens to be burned is arrived at using a formula based on the total number of blocks produced on the Binance Smart Chain, a programmable blockchain powering smart contracts and running parallel to Binance Chain, and BNB's average dollar-denominated price during the quarter.  The move away from the previous token burn methodology, which was based on revenue generated from the Binance centralized exchange, is expected to make the process more objective and clear to the BNB community.  ""The implementation of the BNB auto-burn is a natural next step in BNB’s journey and will help the BNB community grow through providing greater autonomy, transparency, and predictability,” Changpeng Zhao, co-founder and CEO of Binance, said in an official announcement published on the Binance blog.  Binance is committed to destroying 100 million BNB tokens, amounting to 50% of the circulating supply, through quarterly burns. According to data source Coin Tools, the exchange has destroyed nearly 35 million tokens via quarterly burns to date, having begun the program in late 2017.  Token burns are supposedly deflationary and usually meant to bring a store of value appeal to the cryptocurrency. In traditional finance, deflation means a consistent price decline. In crypto, a deflationary token is the one whose circulating supply will decrease over time, thus making it inflation-resistant or store of value asset.  ""BNB is deflationary,"" Zhao tweeted early Tuesday along with the BNB burn news.  However, the 18th burn, the first-ever automated event, announced on Monday, has failed to put a bid under the cryptocurrency.

Jon Russell, its newly hired General Partner based in Bangkok, told CoinDesk on Tuesday the fund will do seed and series-A deals, typically up to a $10 million check for the series-A.  So far Crypto.com’s maiden fund has invested in play-to-earn guild YGG SEA, Ledger and Frax Finance  The fund will be focused on investing in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT) and gaming. It will typically want to lead rounds.  Russell said the fund will be focused on growing the overall crypto ecosystem, not about making investments where Crypto.com thinks it can get business.  Companies the fund invests in won’t necessarily get listed on the Crypto.com exchange, he said.  While Crypto.com capital is expanding, management wants to keep the fund lean and entrepreneurial. It doesn’t want to become ""an a16z"" with hundreds of staff — it's not relatable to entrepreneurs in the crypto space that run a thin organization.  Although the fund is based in Singapore and Russell in Bangkok, it will have a global remit.  In 2021, crypto firms raised $30 billion from VCs, according to PitchBook. Despite the bear market, there’s no sign of this slowing down as alongside Crypto.com Capital’s announcement FTX kicked off the year establishing a $2 billion venture fund to invest in crypto startups.

Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin dropped below $42,000; ether and most other, major altcoins also fell.  Editor's Note: Because of the U.S. Martin Luther King holiday, First Mover Asia is substituting a recent column on DeFi by CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey for the usual Technician's Take.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell below $42,000, although at the time of publication it was above that mark. Ether dropped under $3,200, while most of the other leading altcoins stayed in the red.  Equity markets were shuttered on the holiday, offering a respite from the recent drumbeat of bad news that seems to be increasingly intertwined with crypto pricing. The Wall Street Journal reported that about 220 U.S. publicly traded companies with market capitalizations over $10 billion have fallen 20% from their peaks and that the S&P 500 and Nasdaq had declined 2.2% and 4.8%, respectively.  Meanwhile, a New York Times story highlighted the inability of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to keep pace with data about the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, which has been hammering the global economy.  Pankaj Balani, CEO of the crypto derivatives exchange Delta Exchange, said that bitcoin is vulnerable to falling further because buying demand is absent. ""We are not seeing any bottom fishing at these levels, and the interest to own bitcoin risk around $40,000 remains low,"" Balani told CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole in a WhatsApp chat. ""We could retest $40,000 and should that break, we can see a fresh round of selling come through.""  Column  Off the Charts: DeFi Rebound:Total value locked is rising despite the retreat in other crypto prices. (By Michael Casey)  Amid the weakness in bitcoin and other crypto assets during the latter part of 2021 and early 2022, there’s been an anomalous counter-performance by the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. The last few weeks have seen a modest rebound in total value locked, a measure of how much digital asset value has been collateralized for loans in the DeFi system. CoinDesk’s Shuai Hao whipped me up this chart, based on data from DeFi Pulse, which shows TVL, as expressed in ether, versus the value of the CoinDesk Indices' DeFi (DFX) index.  It’s too early to say whether the rebound in TVL will meaningfully reverse the declines in DeFi commitments seen since last spring. However, it’s notable the value has increased despite close to no rebound in dollar prices. We will have to see whether the sector can return to the unbridled enthusiasm of a year ago, or whether the zeitgeist has been lost to NFTs.
