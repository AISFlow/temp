42412368,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4lD8,1681163772,"Bitcoin Approaches $30K, Reaching Highest Price Since June","For a while Monday, even as large parts of the world were off work celebrating Easter Monday, bitcoin (BTC) seemed headed for a promised land above $30,000.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which just three weeks ago had teased a run toward this threshold, topped $29,744 in the afternoon, its highest level since early June, amid a surge in investor optimism. But the cause of the move was difficult to pinpoint. It was currently trading at $29,616.  Read more: Bitcoin Breaks Above $30K for First Time Since June 2022  From about 10 a.m to 11 a.m. ET (14:00-15:00 UTC), bitcoin rose nearly 4%. It had been lingering closer to $28,000 since mid-March, when fears about the conventional banking system began to diminish.  “There isn't a clear catalyst for this spike,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk, although he said that the surge might stem partly from “buying from crypto traders voicing frustration on social media over a one-sided New York Times article that took issue over [bitcoin's] energy consumption.”  Moya also noted that the move higher “occurred around the release of news that Federal Home Loan Bank debt issuance had lessened, signaling that “the banking crisis was easing.”  Ether (ETH) also jumped, crossing the $1,900 level before retreating. It was recently up about 1.7% versus 24 hours earlier. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, albeit light shades. ARB, the token of layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum, was recently up more than 2.8%, while XRP rose about 1%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of the crypto market's overall performance, recently rose 2.3%.  Equity indexes closed roughly flat with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising a few ticks of a percentage point, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite losing 0.03%. Crypto-related stocks enjoyed a memorable day with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and corporate bitcoin vault MicroStrategy (MSTR) both rising more than 7.5%.  Markets will be eyeing the March Consumer Price March Index (CPI) report this week for signs that inflation is continuing its recent trudge downward.  In February, inflation in the U.S. slowed to 0.4% from 0.5% a month earlier and 6% on a yearly basis from 6.4% the previous month. Bitcoin jumped past $26,000 following that report, on March 14.  A continued slowdown could embolden central bankers to scale back their year-long regime of harsh interest rate hikes, although the impact on bitcoin is uncertain. The crypto seemed to gain momentum following the recent U.S. bank failures that caused worries about the conventional financial system, as investors shifted toward assets that retain value through good times and bad.  Investors will also be weighing the first wave of quarterly earnings with banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup scheduled to report results. Analysts are expecting a largely downcast quarter, particularly in the hard-hit financial services sector.  “BTC is also being seen as a reliable store of value that lacks the issues that come with storing your money by way of a third-party intermediary, or a bank,” Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and chief legal officer of Banxa, a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider to the crypto industry, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “This is further supported by the decreasing correlation with the equity markets since 2021 – BTC is now properly starting to be perceived as a risk-off asset.”  Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, was cautiously optimistic about the sustainability of bitcoin’s Monday surge.  “Bitcoin is likely to find resistance at $30,000,” DiPasquale noted in an email to CoinDesk. From a technical-analysis perspective, the current move is “a retest of the range high established in March after the initial surge from under $20,000. Success of this test would see the price claiming $30,000 while a failure here should see BTC drop to $25,000, followed by $23,000.”  But he added: “The current price is also testing the lows of July 2021, where the market bounced back into another big rally.”  UPDATE (April 10, 2023, 22:27 UTC): Updates with bitcoin's most recent prices.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/10/bitcoin-approaches-30k-reaching-highest-price-since-june,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5e435f71a3656f3b55b0488e53042835497ebdd-3839x2159.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin is trying to break its consolidation level and surpass its nearest resistance to breach the long-awaited $30,000 psychological level, which will introduce a new normal to the market and the new fully formed bull run. As of this writing, the industry’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap is trading at $29,200, posting a profit of over 3% in the last 24 hours. Will Bitcoin continue its bull run through 2023 and the 2024 halving cycle? Related Reading: Is Ethereum Set to Rally After Shanghai? Data Suggests Bullish Sentiment BTC’s Bull Run It’s Just Getting Started According to a recent analysis by the CryptoQuant team, the correlation between BTC and the technology-related index Nasdaq 100 has weakened, dropping 60% from October’s 0.75 to the current value of 0.3. This can indicate that Bitcoin is becoming increasingly independent of traditional markets. According to the analysis, BTC’s market behavior can be divided into two main phases over a longer time frame; accumulation and distribution. During the accumulation phase, it is known that investors buy and hold Bitcoin, which causes its price to rise. In contrast, during the distribution phase, investors sell, causing the price to fall. Bitcoin’s history is characterized by halving events that occur approximately every four years. As seen in the chart above, there is typically an accumulation phase in which institutional investors increase their Bitcoin purchases before each halving event. This trend has been observed in recent months as more financial institutions have adopted cryptocurrencies amidst the banking crisis that has impacted the traditional financial system. Halving events are significant because they reduce the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation, making it more difficult for miners to earn rewards for verifying transactions. This, in turn, leads to a reduction in the supply of new Bitcoin on the market, which can cause an increase in demand and therefore drive up the price. If Bitcoin maintains its bullish momentum and consolidates above the $30,000 mark, it could potentially align with the next halving cycle. According to CryptoQuant analysis, if this happens, it could be relatively straightforward to see BTC reaching $100,000 in the aftermath of the 2024 halving event. Whales Lead The Rally According to the crypto analysis and research firm Material Indicators, the recent uptrend of Bitcoin to the $29,000 mark has been led by “Mega Whales.” According to Material Indicators, the rally has resulted in a shift in the ladders of ask liquidity, which refers to the depth of sell orders at various price points. This shift has made it easier for BTC’s price to increase, indicating a positive market sentiment. However, according to Materials, there is a lack of liquidity above $30,000, so there may not be as much interest in clearing that level yet. Furthermore, ask liquidity has been shifting upwards over the last 24 hours, indicating uncertainty, according to the analysis firm. They further suggest that if Bitcoin’s price reaches an illiquid zone, it could surge quickly, resulting in a rapid price increase.

11624379,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526267,1681153259,Uniswap Price Decline May Bring Fresh Buying Opportunities For Traders,"Over the past few days, the Uniswap price has been trading sideways with minor losses. On the daily time frame, the coin has only moved up by 0.4%, indicating consolidation. Unfortunately, in the last week, UNI has lost almost 2% of its value. For the past couple of weeks, Uniswap’s trading range has been limited between $5.51 and $5.90, respectively. If the price moves above $5.90, the buyers will be in control of the altcoin’s price. At the time of writing, the technical outlook of UNI indicated the presence of bearish forces. The demand and accumulation of the altcoin remained low, while consolidation continued. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Looks Ready For Another Leg Higher Over $1,880 A drop from the current price level would cause UNI to fall toward its immediate support level, potentially entering the selling zone and bringing the bears back. On their respective charts, major altcoins can only move up if Bitcoin breaches the $28,500 mark. Additionally, the daily chart shows a decline in UNI’s market capitalization, pointing to a fall in demand. Uniswap Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, UNI was trading at $5.86, with the coin facing overhead resistance at $6. However, before reaching that level, UNI may encounter brief resistance at $5.90. If the price falls below the $5.80 level, UNI could drop to $5.50, which is considered the supply zone for Uniswap. If the price continues to drop, UNI could trade at $5.10. Conversely, if UNI manages to breach the $6 level, it could attempt to revisit $6.80 and eventually $7. The $5.20-$5.11 zone might experience considerable buying which could mean buy opportunities for traders. The altcoin had formed a descending trendline over the past couple of months, thereby, strengthening the bears in the market. In the last trading session, the amount of Uniswap traded was red, indicating an increase in selling pressure on the chart. Technical Analysis Despite attempts at recovery, the demand for UNI has repeatedly been pulled back into the supply zone. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the 50-mark, indicating a decline in buying strength and demand. As a result, UNI’s price has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), indicating that sellers are driving the price momentum in the market. To reverse this trend, UNI needs to break through the $5.90 resistance level, which would allow the altcoin to move above the 20-SMA line. If UNI can achieve this, it may indicate that buyers are regaining control and potentially signal a bullish trend reversal. In conjunction with other technical indicators, UNI’s daily chart showed a decrease in buy signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which measures price momentum and reversal, indicated a decline in the size of the green histograms, indicating that buy signals were weakening. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Regains Traction But Key Resistance Is Still Intact The Directional Movement Index (DMI), which measures the price direction, was negative, with the -DI (orange) line above the +DI (blue) line. Additionally, the Average Directional Index (ADX) was below the 20-mark, indicating a decrease in the strength of the price direction. Taken together, these indicators suggest that the Uniswap price momentum is weakening.

11623930,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526284,1681152136,Brace Yourself: The Most Explosive Move In Bitcoin In Years Has Begun,"Bitcoin price is current trading at just below $30,000 after spending weeks building up pressure in a tight trading range. The lack of volatility has resulted in a technical signal that says explosive volatility is ahead, and has just begun. Even the tool’s creator has spoken up on the volatility to come. Bollinger Bands Expand After The Second-Tightest Ever The Bollinger Bands in Bitcoin are a volatility measuring tool. Because BTC is so volatile, it makes for a wild rollercoaster ride of a technical indicator. At cycle peaks when BTC is the strongest, the bottom Bollinger Band tends to fall completely off the price chart the expansion in volatility is so significant. But when volatility disappears, the Bands narrow and tighten. This is such an important feature of this tool, the indicator’s creator, John Bollinger, created complementary tools, one of which specifically measures the width of the bands. Related Reading: Data Says Bitcoin Has Begun Its Most Bullish Month Historically On the 2-week timeframe, BTCUSD Bollinger Bands had reached the second-tightest in history. More importantly, after the bands narrowed, they are now expanding, and Bitcoin is trading above the upper band. The Bollinger Band Width shows this expansion in progress, pictured below. We can also see via the BBW indicator more clearly that it was the second most narrow ever. The bands are expanding after the second most narrow in history | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Extended Bitcoin Volatility Incoming, But In Which Direction? The last time the Bollinger Bands were this tight, Bitcoin rallied by over 6,000% from the time it made it outside the upper band for the first time. The rally continued until the cycle peak was in. Along the way, there were very few pullbacks, and BTC never closed below the mid-BB. The middle-line is a 20-period simple moving average, while the upper and lower bands are set at two standard deviations of the SMA. When the Bollinger Bands narrow this much, then expand, it’s called a “squeeze” and suggests strong volatility and a possible explosive move. The Bollinger Bands, however, only tell that volatility is coming and say little about the direction of the market. BTCUSD holding above the mid-BB once again could suggest that the direction is up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Structure Points To New Uptrend, Here’s Why Although the chart above is focused on a more significant, higher timeframe, even the tool’s creator is talking about the incoming volatility. Not only is there a Bollinger Bands squeeze brewing in BTCUSD on the 2-week timeframe, another one is happening on the daily chart. Combined, the expected move is going to be especially powerful. As John Bollinger would say, it is “time to pay attention.” The great and powerful Oz has spoken.

11622970,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526265,1681149638,"Ethereum Staking Deposit Plummets As Shanghai Upgrade Draws Near,  Here’s Why","After recording a spike following the enticing yields of Ethereum (ETH) liquid staking platforms such as Lido offers, Ethereum total staking deposit is beginning to see a plummet just a few days before the Shanghai launch which is set to take place on April 12. This dip was initially revealed by on-chain analytics provider Glassnode on April 9 in a report disclosing the current state of the Ethereum staking ecosystem. According to the report, the decline in Ethereum staking deposits can be attributed to two main factors. Why Is Ethereum Staking Deposit Declining? The on-chain analytics provider revealed ETH staking deposits are currently down due to regulatory pressure and the Shanghai upgrade. Over the past few months, the US regulators especially the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have expressed a keen crackdown move on the crypto industry. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Looks Ready For Another Leg Higher Over $1,880 Recently, the agency deemed Ethereum as security and subsequently went after staking services and platforms supporting the asset. On March 9, New York’s attorney general filed a lawsuit against KuCoin for failing to register with the state before letting investors buy and sell cryptocurrencies on its platform Furthermore, the most anticipated catalyst for Ethereum, the Shanghai upgrade, has been slated to launch within the next two days (April 12), this has caused many investors looking to deposit or stake on the Ethereum mainnet to pause and wait for the aftermath of the upgrade. The Shanghai upgrade, also known as Shapella, is an update that will enable stakers or validators of the Ethereum mainnet to withdraw their staked ETH from their respective staking platforms. According to Glassnode, both of these two factors can be attributed to the reasons behind the ETH staking deposit’s latest plummet. Lido Outshines All Other Staking Providers Meanwhile, among the wide market of staking providers, Lido Finance has emerged as the leader outshining others such as Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. Glassnode data shows the total amount of ETH staked on Lido has reached new highs this year. The analytics provider stated: As the dust settled between the three giants, it was Lido who emerged victorious, continuing to dominate deposit inflows as of present. Related Reading: Total Ethereum (ETH) Staked On Lido Finance Reaches New Milestone Currently, Lido Finance accounts for nearly half of the total ETH staked, with the platform amassing up to $11.1 billion Ethereum staked. With centralized exchanges such as Coinbase taking a 23% commission of every stake, Lido only takes 10% with an additional yield on DeFi platforms via its staking token Lido Staked ETH (stETH). This explains the platform’s large holdings of the total amount of ETH staked. Regardless, ETH is currently moving in a bullish trend up by nearly 1% in the last 24 hours with a trading price of $1,852 and a market capitalization sitting above $223.1 billion.

42389619,6F4ZR09tPAWQmeXaoSbPk8,1681149072,ROOK Token Surges Ahead of $50M Treasury Split Between Community and MEV Tech Builders,"A profound change to the levers of power at Rook, a crypto project building tools for capturing maximal extractable value (MEV) on Ethereum, is hurtling toward passage.  A vote ending Tuesday seeks to divorce the project’s tech from its governance token. Written by Rook Labs, the proposal envisions splitting Rook’s nearly $50 million crypto treasury in half between the key builders of Rook tech and a new community-run entity called Incubator DAO.  After weeks of contentious Discord debates, the proposal offers a detente between a team eager to build unmolested and token holders who feel ignored – despite their nominal governance powers. Rook DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind Rook, hasn’t had much to govern in over a year, insiders told CoinDesk.  Incubator DAO will all but replace Rook DAO, according to public messages and plans reviewed by CoinDesk. It will be fully independent from Rook, meaning its members will get to decide on everything from the project’s name to how to spend its almost-$25 million stash. The project called Rook – which builds technology to capture MEV, or value from the Ethereum transaction chain – will continue under Rook Labs with its multisig signers controlling the remaining treasury.  In addition to getting half of Rook’s funds, the Incubator DAO is set to inherit the old DAO’s unique representative democracy structure. It relies on four elected “sophons” to vet proposals, and new elections have already been held. All four winners have supported a plan to return the $25 million to token holders.  “Given the governance process in place at Rook DAO, and the inability to accrue value to the ROOK token, I think this is the best compromise we could get for token holders,” the pseudonymous Wismerhill, one of the loudest voices calling for change and a sophon in the new DAO, said in an interview.  “It is a win-win,” Wismerhill added. “Rook Labs has sufficient capital to develop the products, and holders don’t have to hold a worthless governance token that was progressively ignored by the protocol.”  The token itself has nearly tripled in value since late March, when Rook Labs’ pseudonymous CEO, Hazard, told the DAO he couldn’t share the project road map. It was trading above $40 early Monday, up 10% in the last 24 hours.  ROOK’s rising token price and debate over the future of the project has attracted investors of many stripes, some of whom have voted with newly-acquired bags. In the poll to create Incubator DAO, the single-largest “yea” position – nearly 15,000 ROOK – was voted by a wallet controlled by insiders at crypto yield project TempleDAO.  “We would love to see a solution that would allow the Rook Team to continue their important work in peace with a unified community,” the pseudonymous head of TempleDAO, Lux.Temple, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  But the TempleDAO wallet isn’t waiting around to find out what happens. It’s already started selling some of its ROOK tokens on decentralized finance (DeFi) exchanges.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/10/rook-token-surges-ahead-of-50m-treasury-split-between-community-and-mev-tech-builders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1002ee41ba0b9a36124f87a881e87431e672944-1024x576.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

11622640,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526289,1681148762,Is Ethereum Set to Rally After Shanghai? Data Suggests Bullish Sentiment,"Over today’s trading session, Ethereum and the crypto market are showing strength and are trading in the green. The positive price action could be supported by the expectation around ETH’s upcoming major upgrade, “Shanghai.” Related Reading: Analyst That Predicted 2022 Crypto Bottom Says Ethereum Will Hit $10,000 Scheduled for April 12th, this upgrade will allow Ethereum 2.0 validators to un-staked their locked ETH. As a result, the cryptocurrency’s available supply is bound to increase, which could translate into negative price action. So far, the opposite is taking place as traders remain optimistic. As of this writing, Ethereum (ETH) trades at around $1,900 with a 3% and 5% profit over the last 24 hours and the previous week, respectively. To Sell Or Not To Sell, Ethereum Investors In A Dilemma According to crypto analysis firm Blofin, the ETH supply locked on the “Beacon Chain,” the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain that supported the transition into this consensus algorithm, is trading at a loss. Thus, investors have little incentive to sell their ETH even after “Shanghai.” It is more likely that these investors will wait for ETH to reclaim previously lost territory, which could support its bullish price action and extend the rally into the high $2,000s. However, Blofin warned: The Ethereum Shanghai upgrade is just around the corner, yet this is not leading to increased selling pressure as most staked Ether is currently at a loss. However, the risk of a sell-off cannot be ignored, and the macro uncertainty around the upgrade is also increasing. In the options market, Blofin records risk aversion among investors, which translates into a “stable” market dynamic. There are a few changes in ETH option contracts’ implied volatility (IV) and speculation around the cryptocurrency. In that sense, most ETH options traders are taking long positions by buying short-term expiring call contracts. This dynamic could support further profits for ETH, but Blofin emphasizes the risk avert sentiment: Most ETH option block traders are bullish on ETH after the Shanghai upgrade. Notably, some traders bought the call spread expiring in 2024q1, which is more likely to be a trade driven by risk management or arbitrage, given the ask-bid spread of yearly options.

Ahead of the network upgrade, the underlying token ( ETH-USD ) rose 2.7% to $1.89K at 1:01 p.m. ET, climbing 31.1% from a month before. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), +4.3% to $29.13K, and other major cryptos also changed hands in the green. ""With the Shapella Upgrade, the liquid staking landscape will be transformed forever, and Ethereum will become the benchmark yield for crypto,"" said Chen Zhuling, founder and CEO of blockchain node network RockX. Shappela, a combination of Shanghai and Capella upgrades, ""represents a game-changing development that positions Ethereum for sustained growth and success. As the platform continues to advance, Ethereum is well-positioned to further diverge from Bitcoin and emerge as a leading blockchain platform, driving innovation and progress in the cryptocurrency space,"" he added. The ability to withdraw staked ether ( ETH-USD ) might entice investors to stake the token and thus the network could see greater capital inflows. Nonetheless, some 60% of the staked ether go through liquid staking providers or centralized exchanges like Coinbase Global ( COIN ) that already offer liquidity access, digital asset research firm FS Insight wrote in a recent Twitter post . Up to the time of Shapella's implementation, users would have to use CEX's or decentralized finance protocols to exchange their locked-up ETH for an equally valued coin. ""Shapella is likely a significant de-risking event and a formal conclusion to Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake, resulting in a continued draw of investors to staking rather than an exodus,"" the firm continued in a follow-up tweet. In addition to unlocking staked ETH withdrawals, the upgrade is set to lower transaction fees and boost the blockchain's capacity to handle more transactions per second. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) migrated to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism in September -- the so-called ""Merge"" software upgrade -- that ultimately replaced miners with blockchain validators .

With the upgrade, users will be able to withdraw the ether they ""staked"" in order to participate in the Ethereum blockchain's consensus system. However, the lingering fear in the market is the impending unlocking of that ETH, deposited to boost network security in return for rewards, will lead to a rush to liquidate and lead to pressure on ETH's price.  Read more: Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade Could Bring $2.4B Selling Pressure to Ether: Observers  But Mosoff said that “a few months down the line,” trading may look different for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  “I expect you will see more ETH get locked into staking, either from solo stakers or, again, you’ll see more structured products come to market,” Mosoff said.  The Shapella upgrade is considered to be the network’s final shift towards fully implementing its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Besides giving users the ability to make withdrawals from the ETH they have staked, the upgrade will lower fees and create more room on the blockchain to handle transactions.  According to Mosoff, the network’s upgrade could also attract a new group of investors.  By giving new investors the ability to earn some yield on the ETH they’ve staked, “you’re going to start to see traditional finance begin to move into the space with more confidence,” Mosoff said.

It’s not rocket science, it’s just everyday work. That’s why so many people are FOMOing over it,” said Ilya, a 33-year old Ukrainian whose main source of income comes from airdrops.  Ilya (he asked CoinDesk to change his name) is also trading crypto for profit, but airdrops have taken up most of his time the past couple of months, he told me over Zoom, speaking from a “Southern European country.”  Ilya is one of the many crypto traders who make money from Sybil attacks on token airdrops. In other words, they spin up multiple accounts on a blockchain project that is expected to airdrop its token, then they snap as many tokens as they can. (A “Sybil” attack gets its name from a 1973 book about a woman with dissociative identity disorder.)  Read more: Arbitrum to Airdrop New Token and Transition to DAO  The attacks exploit the projects’ weak ability to identify and weed out fake accounts and pull tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars out of each airdrop. After they get tokens, they immediately sell.  Free money race  Decentralized finance (DeFi) projects use airdrops – a giveaway of free tokens to the wallets of active members of its blockchain community – to attract more users and encourage activity on the project’s blockchain, such as providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges, interacting with smart contracts and other transactions.  With airdrops, projects try to identify and reward active users without dropping tokens to people who have created accounts at the last minute before the airdrop to snatch tokens without actually engaging with the project. After they get the tokens, these people sell immediately, which drags down the price of the token.  Sybil attackers keep trying to fool the system, imitating healthy blockchain activity from multiple accounts belonging to one person or team. Thus, organizing an airdrop becomes an endless whack-a-mole game for projects – and they are far from winning.  For example, during the recent airdrop for the Ethereum scaling protocol Arbitrum, users and entities controlling multiple addresses received almost 48% of all tokens distributed, according to researchers.  Sybil millionaires  Ilya is 33, and crypto speculation has been his primary job for the last six years. “I got into it in late 2016, before the ICO hype,” he said. He used to be a small business owner, trading grain in Ukraine, before going into online marketing. When he learned about crypto, everything changed. He invested in several initial coin offers and his returns were tenfold.  After the ICO hype cooled down, initial exchange offerings (IEO) came along, then the 2020 DeFi craze, then the non-fungible token (NFT) obsession. If you get ahead of a trend, Ilya said, it’s just a free-money giveaway, with airdrops being just the latest hot opportunity.  One person I know got 200,000 tokens from several thousand accounts  “Airdrops are a legally safer way to distribute a project’s tokens than ICOs,” said Igor Pertsiya, founder of the Hypra venture fund. He said especially deft Sybil attackers can get away with up to several million dollars in crypto from a single airdrop, targeting projects such as Ethereum Name Service (ENS), Sui, Aptos and others.  “I know people who made $1 million to $2 million only from Arbitrum,” Pertsiya told CoinDesk. “Unlike in ICOs, many of which worked more like Ponzis [schemes], participants in airdrops don’t talk about them much because the more people want to join, the less each one will get.”  The evidence is not just anecdotal. Blockchain researchers have spotted crypto wallets that accumulated more than $1 million worth of the Arbitrum ARB tokens from various other wallets, suggesting they belong to the same person. In some cases, those wallets turned out to belong to phishing scammers, who just sucked the funds out of multiple victims’ wallets, it was later found.  Some multi-account users accumulated more modest token totals. Researchers found at least 198 addresses that gathered funds together from multiple other addresses after the snapshot of balances was taken and the list of eligible wallets was confirmed.  ‘Not rocket science’  Ilya was not one of those Arbitrum millionaires, he said. Several of his accounts were detected as part of a Sybil attack and excluded from the airdrop. But five of the accounts he set up did manage to receive 20,000 ARB tokens – almost twice the maximum amount one account could get during the airdrop (10,250 tokens).  Ilya did not hesitate to sell the tokens for $1.40 each, for a profit far exceeding his expenses: to maintain one quality account that won’t get slashed, he would need to pay around $50 in gas fees for transactions on the network, he said.  “One person I know got 200,000 tokens from several thousand accounts. He had a team of people each running 500 accounts,” Ilya said.  Ilya has only one employee helping him manage accounts, who is paid with a regular paycheck and a share of profits from airdrops. Ilya said technical expertise is not necessary to recognize a profitable airdrop. If you can analyze social dynamics and sense what the next trend will be, that’s enough.  In one evening, you could make up to 10 quality accounts. It’s not rocket science, it’s just everyday work  Keeping those accounts alive is “not rocket science,” and even high school kids can maintain a bunch of viable blockchain wallets to make money off airdrops. “I know some guys who aren’t even 18 yet, running 150 accounts each, and one of them recently made $500,000 on airdrops,” he said.  “20-year olds missed the ICO boom, and now it’s a new wave of the young and hungry,” Pertsiya said.  Risking it  You never know what project will drop tokens one day, so airdrop hunters are monitoring multiple projects that seem promising. Criteria?  “It should be well known, with a lot of funds raised, a lot of developers and reputable investors, a lot of hype around it and relevant to what’s happening in crypto at the moment,” Ilya said. Projects satisfying these criteria right now include zksynk, StarkNet and LayerZero, and everything related to scaling Ethereum, he believes.

DeFi protocols have become hackers’ favorite target and lost $2 billion in 2022 alone, according to the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. Cross-chain bridges in particular appeared to be one of the most attractive targets for attacks.  “People would pour in liquidity hoping for an airdrop [in the future], and then that bridge gets hacked and some hacker gets away with your $5,000,” Ilya said. He does not recall losing a lot in such attacks, Ilya said, but people he knows had up to $10,000 worth of tokens in the recently exploited Euler lending protocol. At least the attacker volunteered to return the funds.  Hunting the hunters  Alex Momot, CEO of a crypto startup Peanut Trade, said his team has been monitoring the Sybil attacks on airdrops closely. One of the services Peanut provides is helping DeFi projects avoid such abuses. Usually, the tactics of airdrop hunters are pretty simple, he said: Do a bare minimum of transactions with minimal amounts of tokens just to pass the threshold of eligibility.  Hunters often fund their wallets by withdrawing money from a centralized exchange. Because all such withdrawals are processed from an exchange’s hot wallet, which aggregates coins of many users in one place, it’s impossible to see who exactly withdrew tokens. This makes it harder to identify wallets that received funding from the same wallet and thus, apparently, belong to the same owner.  However, there are still ways to exclude the airdrop hunters with multiple accounts from the distribution. For example, projects may slash all wallets that barely pass the threshold.  “On one hand, it’s not bad projects get some traction, even this way, but they are interested in creating real communities and having real traction,” Momot said. “The worst thing is, projects lose millions in market capitalization at the moment of exchange listing [because] such users immediately sell.”",NEGATIVE,ARB | ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ARB | ENS | AIRDROP,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/10/crypto-airdrop-sybil-attacks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/073f873ab0837c932c64610899f92aac8b796f3a-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Chan said that in planning Hong Kong's budget he identified Web3 technologies as one of three focus areas to target.  The secretary said the cryptocurrency industry reminds him of the early days of the internet in the 2000s, with a large “bubble” that burst and weeded out players. As a result, the market was quieter and real-world use cases could be promoted.  “In order for Web3 to steadily take the road of innovative development, we will adopt a strategy that emphasizes both ‘proper regulation’ and ‘promoting development,’” said Chan. “In terms of proper supervision, in addition to ensuring financial security and preventing systemic risks, we will also do a good job in investor education and protection, and anti-money laundering.”  Chan noted that Hong Kong will host the Digital Economy Summit this week, a two-day event with a focus on analyzing the adoption of Web3 technologies at a state and global level.  Hong Kong officials have been laying plans to accelerate the adoption of Web3 and cryptocurrency. In February, Chan set aside $6.4 million of Hong Kong’s annual budget to be put towards investing in Web3 technologies.  Early Monday morning, crypto exchange Bitget created a $100 million fund to focus on Asian countries adopting Web3 technologies because, it said, regulations in the U.S. have forced many companies to look overseas. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s recent licensing changes for crypto exchanges are considered a possible positive sign for growth in Asia.

The Current Bitcoin Cycle Has Shown Interesting Parallels With The 2017 Cycle As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, there have been five interesting recent events in the current cycle that are similar to what was seen in the 2017 cycle. The 2017 cycle hit its top in December of that year, while the current cycle hit its top back in November of 2021. The entirety of these cycles isn’t relevant in the context of the current discussion; only the bearish trends that followed after their respective highs were attained.

In both of these cycles, the price first observed a bear market phase where the asset endlessly consolidated. In the case of the 2017 cycle, the sideways movement was around the $6,000 level, while for 2021, it was about the $20,000 mark. Both these consolidation periods ended with the price seeing a sharp plunge. Assuming that the lows after the FTX crash back in November 2022 were the worst this bear market is going to get, then the similar sharp plunges in these cycles also lead to bear bottoms for both of them. After these lows, the price again took to sideways movement in both the 2017 and 2021 cycles. In the 2017 cycle, the price followed up this period with sharp bullish momentum in the form of the April 2019 rally. The current cycle also seems to be showing something similar in the form of the rally that started earlier this year. Bitcoin hit a roadblock midway through the April 2019 rally and slumped into a sideways consolidation phase again. The quant believes that this is the phase the current cycle is in right now, as BTC’s price action has been quite stale recently. The X-axis of the graph shows the number of days since the top that these events took place in these cycles. It’s interesting how close the cycles have seemingly been in not just the structure, but also the timing of the events.

Also, he commended the few investors who remained bullish despite the blow dealt to them by the 2022 bear cycle.

But, Burniske is optimistic that crypto is resilient enough to persist and flourish, no matter the harsh regulatory atmosphere. Regulatory Crackdown Actions On Crypto The regulatory atmosphere for crypto in 2023 has been harsh, as top crypto exchanges and firms face enforcement actions from regulators. It has caused increased market volatility, even amid the crisis in top US crypto-friendly banks. Binance is one of the latest cryptocurrency exchanges to enter regulators’ radar. Besides being under investigation by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and a desist order against its BUSD, Binance received a lawsuit from the CFTC. On March 27, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a lawsuit against Binance, its CEO Changpeng Zhao, and former compliance officer Samuel Lim. The regulator alleged that the trio violated the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations. In its complaint, the CFTC alleged that Binance allowed users to trade derivatives on its platform without registering with US regulators. Besides Binance, Coinbase could also face a lawsuit after a Wells notice it received from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulators notified the crypto exchange of plans to launch an enforcement action against it for possible securities law violation.

11617679,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526229,1681135219,"Polkadot Trades Sideways, Key Levels To Monitor For DOT","The price of Polkadot has been trading sideways within a narrow range of $5.7 to $6.6 in recent days, with a slight uptick of only 0.7% in the past 24 hours indicating consolidation. The weekly chart shows a decline of 1.7%, and the technical outlook is bearish with decreasing demand and accumulation. Although buying pressure is still present above the $6.10 mark, the ongoing consolidation has caused a decline in buyers’ confidence. If buyers fail to act soon, Polkadot could drop below its current price level and reach its local support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Circulation Rate Remains Low, Why This Could Be Bad For Rally Similar to Polkadot, other altcoins have also exhibited a lack of decisive price action due to Bitcoin’s indecisive movement between $26,800 and $28,800 over the past few weeks. Should Bitcoin continue to trade in this range, altcoins may remain stuck under their immediate resistance levels. The market capitalization of DOT declined to indicate a rise in demand for the altcoin. Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, Polkadot’s native token, DOT, was trading at $6.18, with immediate overhead resistance levels at $6.30 and $6.60. If DOT manages to break past the $6.30 resistance level, where selling pressure is currently intense, it could potentially attempt to trade above the $6.60 mark. However, a decline from the current level would bring Polkadot down to $6.10, which could bring bears back into the market and potentially drag the altcoin down to $6. In the previous session, the amount of Polkadot traded declined, which indicated a fall in demand for the altcoin on the one-day chart. This, coupled with the ongoing consolidation, has caused a decline in buyers’ confidence. Technical Analysis In the previous session, buying strength in the Polkadot market had been attempting to recover. However, despite these efforts, the DOT token was trading laterally, failing to break out of its current range. At the time of writing, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) had fallen below the half-line, indicating that sellers were currently outnumbering buyers in the market. Nevertheless, with just a slight push from the buyers, DOT could potentially rebound and travel back into the positive buying zone. Similarly, the price of the asset had also dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line. This reading suggested that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market, with demand falling on the daily chart. However, the 20-SMA can act as a support level for the asset in the event of a further drop in price. As the buying strength declined, DOT began exhibiting sell signals on its daily chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displayed red signal bars, indicating a sell signal for the altcoin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction: Doge Near Key Juncture and 100 SMA Is The Key This suggested that the price momentum was gradually shifting in favour of the bears. Meanwhile, the Bollinger Bands, which reflect price volatility and fluctuations, remained narrow, pointing towards range-bound movements for DOT in the upcoming trading sessions.

The Series A round, which was led by market maker DWF Labs – which has emerged as one of the most active investors during the crypto bear market – gave the AI-focused blockchain a $250 million valuation, according to a statement.  Read more: Market Maker DWF Labs Emerges as Top Crypto Investor  CryptoGPT recently rolled out Web3-focused AI assistant ""Alex"" and is developing its ZK rollup layer 2 blockchain and a data-to-AI engine, which collects, encrypts and transfers data for commercial applications.  ""Instead of applying ZK technology to payments, CryptoGPT integrates it for private data transfers,"" CryptoGPT said in the statement on Monday. The proceeds of the new funding will be used to grow its developer team globally and build on its regional presence in the Asian markets, said Dejan Erja, co-founder and chief technology officer of the AI-focused blockchain.  CryptoGPT's broad aim is to allow users to earn money by monetizing their data across fitness, dating, gaming and education. It also plans to roll out non-fungible tokens (NFT) that store the owner's activity data.  There has been a boom in interest around AI-focused cryptocurrencies since the start of the year, thanks to the mainstream success of chatbot ChatGPT. However, there is some skepticism around the longer-term viability of such tokens, with views that the healthy gains enjoyed by them in recent months are little more than a short-term price pump by opportunistic traders on the back of the hype.  CryptoGPT's native token GPT, issued in early March this year, has a market cap of just over $12 million at the time of writing, according to data by CoinMarketCap.

11616337,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526231,1681131609,Shiba Inu Price Set For Breakout From Bull Pattern In April,"The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price continues to consolidate, showing little momentum to initiate another furious rally. With the Bitcoin price trading below the key resistance zone at $28,600, an altcoin season has so far failed to materialize – and with it an important catalyst for previous SHIB rallies. However, SHIB has quietly formed a bullish chart pattern that could point to a price breakout before the end of April. After the sharp pullback from $0.00001591 in early February, SHIB reached a local low at $0.00000967 on March 10. However, since then SHIB has been writing higher lows and has formed an ascending triangle pattern on the 1-day chart. As is characteristic of an ascending triangle formation, Shiba Inu price is showing a flat resistance level at the upper end. This is at $0.00001151 for SHIB and could not be broken in seven attempts so far. The lower side is sloping upward as price reaches higher lows. Traditionally, the pattern can signal weakening resistance and an impending breakout to the upside. These higher lows indicate that bulls are gaining the upper hand in the market. In other words, this could mean that Shiba Inu may continue the uptrend initiated in early January after a two-month consolidation if the horizontal resistance line at $0.0000151 is cleared. For this to happen, however, buyers will need to build more pressure against sellers to continue writing higher lows and ultimately achieve the breakout. Related Reading: Whale Adds 378.74 Billion Shiba Inu In 3 Days, Good Time To Buy The Dip? The apex of the ascending triangle sits at the end of April, so a turning point for SHIB will come no later than that. Either the $0.00001151 level is broken or the bullish chart pattern is threatened to be invalidated. Then, a retest of the local low of early February becomes a possibility. Importantly, a breakout from the triangle requires a rising trading volume. If the breakout takes place under low volume, it can be a false signal, as some of the last attempts have shown. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Trails Dogecoin With 9% Rally – Will SHIB See Further Gains? Bullish Catalysts For Shiba Inu An external catalyst outside the SHIB ecosystem could be an “altcoin season.” In a recent analysis, Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, co-founders of Glassnode, write that a collapse in the Bitcoin price to $25,000 to $26,500 could lead to a full-blown alt season. “So, we are seeing signs that the altcoin season is coming, but we await a solid confirmation, such as numerous altcoins going off (exploding). As of now, only 4 show explosiveness,” the two analysts write. Shiba Inu intrinsically, the launch of Shibarium on the mainnet is likely to be the biggest catalyst for SHIB. However, as Influencer Lucie shared today, the date is not yet known. “I don’t have a crystal ball, it could be 2-6 months,” the SHIB community member wrote. Wen is not a fruitful question, I ignore it. I don't have a crystal ball, it could be 2-6 months — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) April 10, 2023 In that respect, this catalyst seems very unlikely to happen by the end of April. If anything, announcements for the beta testnet could create a re-emergence of hype. Other factors may include a further increase in the SHIB burn rate, led by the Koyo project, as well as the continued growth of the SHIB user base.

Coinbase is exploring non-trading revenue streams, such as staking rewards, subscription fees, and institutional services, to reduce its exposure to trading revenue. The company is aiming to become a 360-degree crypto solutions provider, but investors should not overestimate the diversification benefits. Cryptocurrency has changed the way we view money and investments. Investing is no longer just about holding cash or stocks, but also about digital assets that can be traded and invested in. Coinbase Global Inc. ( COIN ) is one of the leading cryptocurrency exchange platforms that has made it possible for people to buy, sell, and store digital assets. With more than 100 million verified users and $80 billion in assets on its platform, Coinbase is a dominant player in the cryptocurrency exchange space, especially in the United States. In the face of volatile crypto prices and evolving regulatory frameworks, Coinbase has come under pressure in recent weeks. Coinbase, however, has introduced several strategies to navigate these challenging market conditions. After examining whether these strategies are truly transformative or merely stopgap measures, I have concluded that the majority of Coinbase’s revenue will remain tied to crypto trading for at least another 10 years. This does not make Coinbase a bad bet on the future of crypto by any stretch of the imagination. However, long-term-oriented investors will have to be cautious today for reasons discussed in this analysis. Moving On From An Eventful 2022 Last year presented a difficult landscape for crypto investors, with cryptocurrencies bearing the brunt of the market turbulence. Bitcoin peaked at $69,000 in November 2021 before spiraling down to approximately $16,000 in December 2022. Multiple factors contributed to the 2022 cryptocurrency market decline, including persistently high inflation and rising interest rates. This market decline was further aggravated by two unforeseeable events. The first was the de-pegging of LUNA in Q2 2022, which resulted in a nearly 60% drop in crypto market capitalization and exposed weak risk management practices, leading to credit-related bankruptcies of Three Arrows Capital, Voyager, and Celsius. The second event was the collapse of FTX in Q4 2022, a fraud-driven disaster that further fueled credit-related bankruptcies. Along with the recovery of Bitcoin prices, Coinbase stock has staged a tremendous comeback this year with the stock price up more than 80% so far in 2023. Exhibit 1: The performance of Bitcoin and COIN in 2023 Data by YCharts Coinbase’s Q4 2022 earnings report highlighted a 5% sequential improvement in revenue to $605 million. Of this, $322 million was transaction revenue, while $283 million was related to subscriptions and services. Q4 total transaction revenue declined by 12% compared to the previous quarter, driven by lower trading volume. The company did, however, gain overall trading volume market share in the quarter, with a total trading volume of $145 billion, outperforming the global crypto spot market trading volume, which declined by 21% sequentially. Coinbase's institutional trading volume declined by 6% in Q4 compared to Q3, while consumer transaction revenue came to $309 million, down 11% from Q3. Amid challenges, Coinbase continued to onboard top hedge funds, with roughly 25% of the world's largest hedge funds using Coinbase as of Q4 2022. The company's fourth-quarter financial performance is a testament to how its fortunes are closely tied to crypto trading today despite commendable efforts to diversify into new business areas. The Other Side Of Revenue Diversification Efforts Coinbase is diversifying its revenue sources to create a more sustainable business model. Trading fees have been Coinbase's primary source of income for years. However, the company is aware that trading fees are highly dependent on the volume and price of cryptocurrencies, which can be volatile and unpredictable. To reduce its exposure to these risks, Coinbase is increasingly focusing on non-trading revenue. Staking rewards, subscription fees, and institutional services are a few non-trading revenue streams that the company is exploring. Staking Rewards: Staking rewards are payments that users receive for locking up their crypto assets to support a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Coinbase offers staking services for several cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum 2.0, Tezos, Cosmos, and Algorand. According to its latest earnings report, staking revenue represented approximately 3% of net revenue in Q4. The company's largest staked balance is ETH2, which was approximately $3 billion as of December 2022. In Q4, Coinbase expanded access to ETH2 staking to Canada and Australia, allowing more users to earn staking rewards. Subscriptions: Coinbase is exploring subscription fees as a source of non-trading revenue. The company launched Coinbase Pro in 2018, a platform for more advanced and professional traders that charges a monthly fee based on the user's trading activity. Additionally, Coinbase plans to launch a new subscription product called Coinbase Bundle, which will allow users to access a curated portfolio of cryptocurrencies for a fixed fee. Subscription and services revenues grew over 17x to nearly $800 million in 2022 from less than $50 million in 2020. Institutional Services: Catering to institutional investors is another area where Coinbase is expanding its non-trading revenue. The company has seen a growing demand from institutional clients, such as hedge funds, asset managers, corporations, and endowments, who want to invest in or use cryptocurrencies. Coinbase provides these clients with various solutions, such as custody, execution, data, prime brokerage, and lending. Exhibit 2: Subscription and services revenue Q4 2022 shareholder letter These revenue diversification efforts deserve a lot of credit, in my opinion, as these indicate the company's vision to transform Coinbase into a 360-degree crypto solutions provider at the heart of the global crypto economy - not just a cryptocurrency exchange. That being said, I believe investors should not overestimate the diversification benefits the company will enjoy in the long run. The idea behind these efforts is to reduce the company's dependence on the strength of crypto trading volumes. However, the demand for subscriptions and related services is likely to be a function of the crypto market strength. Therefore, these diversification efforts will not necessarily set up the company for success in a severe crypto market downturn. Coinbase's inability to truly diversify its revenue streams is a structural challenge faced by all crypto marketplaces alike so this certainly has nothing to do with Coinbase or its business strategy. With COIN stock up 80% this year, I fear Mr. Market is overlooking the threats posed by this fundamental challenge, which is one of the reasons why I believe investors should be cautious of investing in Coinbase stock today. The other reasons behind my stance are discussed in the next segment. Challenges Looming On The Horizon While diversifying its revenue sources beyond trading fees, Coinbase faces some challenges and risks. Some of the non-trading revenue streams are still nascent and unproven, such as staking. Moreover, some of them may face regulatory hurdles or competition from other players in the industry. One of the major regulatory hurdles that Coinbase faces is the threat posed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been scrutinizing its crypto-staking programs. Staking is a process where users lock up their crypto assets in exchange for rewards, similar to earning interest on a bank account. In 2021, the SEC warned Coinbase that its proposed lending product that allowed users to earn interest by lending digital assets may violate securities laws and threatened to sue the company if it proceeded with the launch of this product. The SEC issued another warning recently over some of Coinbase’s products. Coinbase has received a formal declaration from the SEC in the form of a Wells notice, which warns of potential enforcement action related to certain business practices of the company in the spot market, as well as its Earn, Prime, and Wallet products. Coinbase is also grappling with a potential new tax reporting requirement for crypto transactions under the U.S. infrastructure bill. The provision would mandate intermediaries like Coinbase, as well as miners and validators, to report sender and receiver information, transaction amount, and date to the IRS. Critics claim the provision is too broad and burdensome, warning that it could limit innovation and competitiveness in the crypto industry. The Senate has already approved the bill, but it still requires approval from the House of Representatives. Some lawmakers have proposed amendments to mitigate the scope of the reporting requirement. The EU introduced a new regulation last year, called the Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) law, which mandates that cryptocurrency firms must obtain a license and implement customer protection measures to issue and trade digital tokens in the European Union. The law provides a ""passport"" that enables crypto asset issuers and related service providers to serve customers throughout the EU from a single location. Additionally, the law ensures that holders of stablecoins are entitled to redeem them at any time and free of charge by the issuer, with all stablecoins being overseen by the bloc's banking regulator. This is a step forward in the EU's efforts to regulate the crypto industry by bringing the industry closer to the broad financial services sector. The increasing involvement of regulators - although necessary - will spook some crypto users as they were drawn to cryptocurrencies because of the lack of an intermediary. The objective of this article is not to determine the level of regulatory involvement that would be ideal for the growth of the crypto economy but what is evident is that increasing regulatory involvement is already proving to be a challenge. At a roundtable event, Bo Li, the IMF Deputy Managing Director, warned about the potential risks that crypto assets may pose to global financial stability, especially in emerging market economies. He stressed the importance of licensing, registering, and authorizing critical crypto-asset services providers including marketplaces to ensure consumer protection and prevent illegal activities. Furthermore, Mr. Li emphasized the need for regulatory authorities to implement a risk-based approach to crypto regulation that balances the mitigation of risks with promoting innovation and competition in the digital financial sector. In response to increasing regulatory challenges, Coinbase has taken several steps to protect its interests and influence policy outcomes. One such measure has been the hiring of several former regulators and government officials to its legal and compliance teams, such as Brett Redfearn, a former director of the SEC as its vice president of capital markets, and Faryar Shirzad, a former deputy national security advisor and Goldman Sachs ( GS ) executive as its chief policy officer. Additionally, Coinbase has been lobbying lawmakers and regulators to support favorable legislation and regulation for the crypto industry, such as the Eliminate Barriers to Innovation Act. However, these steps may not be sufficient to ensure Coinbase's long-term success and growth. While diversifying revenue sources and expanding the customer base are important strategies, they come with increased costs and risks. The company's cost base has materially increased in the last couple of years as Coinbase doubled down on non-trading revenue streams. For the company to break through to profitability again, it would take much higher crypto prices than in 2022 and 2021. Offering non-trading services such as staking and lending may also expose Coinbase to more regulatory scrutiny and potential litigation from customers who may lose money due to technical issues or market fluctuations. Coinbase is looking for growth opportunities in international markets to overcome regulatory threats in the U.S., and I believe this is the right strategy. However, expanding into new jurisdictions may require Coinbase to comply with different and sometimes conflicting rules and standards, which may limit its operational efficiency and profitability. The company has been exploring new markets where crypto regulations are more favorable or flexible, such as Japan, Germany, Ireland, India, and Singapore. However, it remains to be seen how successful Coinbase will be in these markets, and whether the company will face new regulatory challenges. Takeaway Coinbase has a strong foundation with a recognizable brand, loyal customer base, and diversified revenue streams, but it faces significant challenges from intense competition, regulatory ambiguity, and volatile crypto markets. To cope with these challenges, Coinbase has taken several steps to transform its business. However, it's unclear whether these changes will have a lasting impact on the company.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4593159-coinbase-stock-up-80-percent-ytd-time-to-be-cautious?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11616037.jpeg

Latest Prices  Top Stories  Ether options call-put skew showed both short-term and long-term bearish put options trading at a slight premium to bullish calls. The put bias shows lingering concerns that some ""stakers"" might rush to liquidate their tokens following Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade on Wednesday and drive prices lower despite analysts suggesting otherwise. Skew measures the cost of calls relative to puts and reflects what people are willing to pay to acquire an asymmetric payout on either the upward or downward direction of the market. The Shanghai upgrade will open withdrawals of more than 18 million ETH staked in the Beacon Chain since December 2020. According to Galaxy Digital, 553,650 ETH might be sold over seven days following the upgrade, amounting to a per-day selling pressure equal to just 1% of Ether's daily trading volume and is likely to have a big negative impact on the cryptocurrency’s price. Ether rose 1.4% to $1,860 early Monday.

The whales have pushed their total Cardano holdings close to 3 billion ADA. According to a crypto analyst @ali_charts, Cardano whale addresses holding between 100 million and 1 billion ADA tokens have been on a huge accumulation campaign. But ADA price is yet to reclaim its hold on the $0.40 it lost last week. Cardano Whales On Buying Spree The crypto analyst noted the top Cardano whales had amassed about 560 million ADA tokens over the past two weeks. He made the report based on data from an IntoTheBlock chart. At the time of the report, the accumulated ADA tokens were worth $218.4 million. The chart shows that the whales began their massive move on Cardano in April. It indicated a higher purchase activity on April 5 for these addresses. At this point, ADA was significantly trying to reclaim the $0.40 price value for the second time in a few days. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Price Model Predicts Fair Price Of At Least $379,823 With the accumulation campaign, the total holdings of the whale addresses have grown to $1.16 billion. Cardano transactions above $100,000 have also witnessed an increase to an estimated value of about $13.61 billion. In an older post, he noted that about 92,000 addresses accumulated 4.4 billion ADA as the token formed a crucial support region between $0.365 and $0.376. The trend was prominent among Cardano addresses that hold between 1 million and 10 million ADA tokens. The analyst reported that these whale addresses purchased almost 150 million ADA worth $57 million over the past 30 days. Additionally, the increased performance in Cardano cuts across the non-zero addresses in the network. A tweet from Cardanians on April 7 shows that about 79,196 non-zero addresses have been added to the network in 2023. This indicates more demand for ADA as the non-zero addresses hit 2,237,610 at the time of the report. ADA Price Action At the time of writing, ADA is trading at around $0.3883, showing a slight drop of about 0.28% over the past 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap, Cardano ranks as the 7th top crypto asset with a market cap of $13.46 billion. Its 24-hour trading volume is at $196.84 million, increasing 6.57%.

Bitcoin Circulation Has Remained Low Despite Recent Price Surge According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, 105,000 BTC is moving per day currently. The relevant indicator here is the “circulation,” which measures the unique daily number of Bitcoin tokens that are showing some movement on the blockchain. Since the metric only counts unique coins, it means that if a token has been shifted on the network multiple times in a single day, its movement will still contribute only one unit toward the circulation indicator. The reason the metric has this restriction is that a large number of the same coins move around a lot on the chain on any given day, with only a handful of investors being responsible for their movements. Many such transactions are relay transfers and other duplicate movements, which don’t actually have much relevance to the market. Thus, if the indicator counted just the pure number of tokens being moved around, regardless of whether they were unique or not, an inaccurate picture regarding the chain activity may appear. When the value of the circulation is high, it means a large number of unique tokens are seeing some transaction activity right now. Such a trend implies the blockchain is likely observing participation from a high amount of unique users. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits All-Time High For The 4th Time In 2023: Here’s Why Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in Bitcoin circulation, as well as in its 30-day moving average (MA), over the last year: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite low in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin circulation has remained at relatively low levels for quite a while now. The 3AC collapse back in June 2022 and the FTX crash in November 2022 was the last couple of instances where the indicator hit some high values. These surges in the metric weren’t unexpected, as crashes of this kind generally attract a large number of new users to the network (and wake up some dormant old ones), thus leading to a spike in the unique number of tokens being moved across wallets on the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin Korea Premium Index Turns Red, Decline Incoming? Just like crashes can force people to make some moves, rallies can also have a similar effect on the network. However, despite the fact that the current rally started back in January of this year, the Bitcoin circulation hasn’t shown any significant uptick so far. According to the 30-day MA of the metric, coins are being moved at a rate of 105,000 per day, which is 56% less than the one-year highs seen back in June 2022. “When looking for validation of mid/long term bull runs, utility should be rising,” explains Santiment. As the utility of the cryptocurrency hasn’t increased recently, it’s possible that the rally may run out of steam before long.

Analysts are therefore divided on whether the Bitcoin price is on the verge of another capitulation or whether the bears are running out of steam and the breakout above $30,000 is finally coming. Bitcoin Price On the Verge Of A Breakout? In their latest analysis, Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, co-founders of Glassnode, note that Bitcoin remains unwilling to break out to the upside or break down. According to the two experts, the consolidation poses the risk that Bitcoin will dip towards $25,000 in order to collect liquidity: Despite the short-term shakiness, the price has been pushed to the upside of the range, consolidating between $27.7k (pivot point) and $28.6k. The longer we hover within the range, the more likely that bitcoin drops to $25-$26.5k to catch liquidity, leading to the full-blown alt season. However, the Bitcoin risk signal remains stable at the lower extreme, suggesting that the risk of a full-blown drop to the $25,000-$26,600 range is relatively low and a max pain scenario. To the upside, the price could rise to $29,200 to $30,000, according to Glassnode founders. On the other hand, on-chain analyst Ali Martinez is much more bullish. “Another Bitcoin indicator hints at explosive growth!” wrote the analyst yesterday, referring to the aSORP. Related Reading: Buckle Up! Bitcoin Bollinger Bands Signal An Impending Rollercoaster Ride Historically, an aSORP (90-day moving average) below 1 has signaled a bear market. When above 1, it has always marked the beginning of a new bull market.

Technical chart analyst and founder of Eight Global, Michaël van de Poppe, agreed with Glassnode founders today that Bitcoin is still stuck in the range of the last three weeks and continues to consolidate. But he is bullish too: Big event this week with CPI, probably the market mover. If another test of $28,600 takes place, I’m assuming we’ll be breaking out upwards. While numerous experts expect another dip and want to buy only at $25,000, van der Poppe believes that this will not happen. His reasoning: there are currently no clear bearish divergences on higher time scales. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Price Model Predicts Fair Price Of At Least $379,823 Jesse Colombo, economic analyst and Forbes contributor is currently observing a pennant pattern that currently appears to be forming below the crucial $30,000 resistance level. Via Twitter, Colombo shared the chart below and elaborated: If Bitcoin can break out of that pennant pattern & above $30,000 with strong trading volume, it would be a bullish confirmation signal. Bears Warn Of Another Capitulation On the other hand, the pseudonymous analyst “@52skew” warns of a time-based capitulation after Bitcoin failed to sustainably break through the $28,600 mark in higher time frames in recent weeks. The analyst speculates that investors are losing faith in Bitcoin’s strength (as evidenced by falling volume). At press time, the Bitcoin price was at $28,313, consolidating below key resistance.

42412376,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4lJg,1681114583,Bitcoin Faces Low Risk of 'Liquidations-Induced' Price Volatility After 70% Surge,"Bitcoin (BTC) has surged 70% this year, hitting nine-month highs of over $29,000. While the sharp rally has brought the derivatives market back to life, the overall use of leverage remains muted, suggesting a low risk of ""liquidations-induced"" wild price swings.  Liquidations refer to the forced closure of bullish long and bearish short positions in leveraged perpetual futures markets, which allow traders to open positions worth much more than the money deposited as margin. The forced closure for cash or cash equivalent happens when the trading entity fails to meet the margin shortage stemming from the market moving against its bullish or bearish bet.  When the degree of leverage in the market – measured by the ratio between the dollar value locked in perpetual futures (open interest) and the cryptocurrency's market capitalization – is high, short liquidations tend to exacerbate bullish moves. That, in turn, shakes out more shorts, leading to a short squeeze. Similarly, long liquidations exacerbate bearish moves, leading to a long squeeze.  Long/short squeezes were quite common during the 2021 bull run and early bear market days of 2022 when the amount of leverage outstanding relative to the size of the market was quite high and price moves would shake out billions of dollars' worth of leveraged trading positions. So far this year, the ratio has continued to drop.  ""High open interest relative to market cap means the market could be vulnerable to a short-squeeze or liquidation cascade, which would result in a price swing being more volatile than it otherwise would have been due to forced buying or selling, respectively,"" analysts at Blockware Solutions said in a weekly newsletter.  ""The medium-term trend of decreasing open interest/market cap has not been broken, which is reassurance that, even in the event of downward volatility, price is most likely not going to decrease to the level it was at to begin the year,"" the analysts added.  The perpetual futures open interest to market ratio has been falling since FTX, which was once the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world and one of the preferred avenues to trade perpetual futures, went bust in early November.  The ratio has stayed low despite the recent price consolidation, a sign of investors' low appetite for risk, according to Blockware Solutions.  ""BTC has essentially traded sideways for the past three weeks, yet, we haven’t seen a build-up in open interest. This is a signal that the market is still in a risk-off mode,"" Blockware's analysts noted, saying the non-expiring perpetual futures are typically in demand during periods of sideways price action, as seen ahead of FTX's implosion.  Bitcoin has been locked in the narrow range of $29,000 to $27,000 since March 21, according to CoinDesk data.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/10/bitcoin-faces-low-risk-of-liquidations-induced-price-volatility-after-70-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63b1c1928c1743e0d6b90ecda41146d3a46cf50a-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The discount to book is probably justified given no meaningful HODL stack to speak of and declining BTC production. If I were a DGHI shareholder, I'd be praying for a buyout before the company goes into debt or blows any more capital on call options. One of the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners that I've had on watch for some time is Digihost Technology ( DGHI ). It's a much smaller cap public miner but it has a potentially compelling setup in that the company has no debt, doesn't spend as much on SG&A relative to peers, and trades below book value. The company released its full year earnings and March production figures on Monday and I see a few warning signs. Full Year 2022 Performance Purely from a revenue standpoint, it could have been worse. Digihost pulled in $24.2 million from digital currency mining in 2022. This was down just 3% from the $25 million the company earned in 2021. Many other miners saw revenue decline between 15 to 25% year over year. For Digihost, the decline in the headline number is a result of lower Bitcoin prices rather than declining production as the company had a 60% year over year increase in the amount of BTC mined. However, the increase in production did come with a larger move up in expense as Digithost's cost of revenue nearly doubled from 2021: December 312022 December 312021 YoY Change Revenue from digital currency mining 24,190 24,952 -3.1% Cost of sales -20,278 -10,542 92.4% Depreciation and amortization -10,709 -3,281 226.4% Gross profit -6,797 11,129 -161.1% Source: Digihost, figures in millions of USD The 92% increase in cost of revenue and the 226% increase in machine amortization followed what was $11.1 million gross profit in 2021 with a $6.8 million gross loss in 2022. When we add in the other expenses for Digihost, we come to a full year operating loss of $28.3 million: December 312022 December 312021 YoY Change General and administrative and other expenses -8,352 -10,646 -21.5% Loss on settlement of debt -294 -390 -24.6% Gain (loss) on disposition of cryptocurrencies -11,574 291 -4,077.3% Loss on digital currency option calls -1,950 - Operating income (loss) -28,285 2,923 -1,067.7% Revaluation of warrant liabilities 32,010 1,551 1,963.8% Source: Digihost, figures in millions of USD While it certainly wasn't the biggest driver of the company's negative operating income for the year, it is a bit concerning seeing Digihost give away $2 million in options calls. I should also point out that Digihost is showing a $4.3 million positive net income year that is entirely attributed to a $32 million liability revaluation of the company's 9.1 million outstanding warrants: DigiHost Those warrants have a weighted average exercise price of $7.04 and don't begin expiring for another year. Assets, Liabilities, & Production Digihost ended the year with $52.6 million in assets and just $2.1 million in long term liabilities. This is a dramatic improvement from the $36.2 million in long term liabilities at the end of 2021: Digihost The company's debt situation is in a much better position than it was in 2021, but I'd say there is a chance we could see that change this year. Digihost is trying to scale an additional 100MW by the end of next year and has already foreshadowed through its MD&A that the company will have to raise capital through financing to do so: The Company presently anticipates that additional financing maybe required to acquire additional power generation facilities in the future in order to meet the Company's objective of obtaining access to an additional 100MW of power by the end of 2024. The Company also anticipates that additional financing will be required to purchase the miners required to utilize its maximum capacity. We've already seen share dilution over the last year and the company just raised another $380k through share issuance over the last 3 months. The majority of the company's $52.6 million in assets are property, plant, and equipment. As of the March production update, DGHI has about $3 million in cash, BTC, and deposits. Monthly BTC production (Digihost) The fundamental problem for all miners is the global BTC mining exahash continues to make new highs each month. Without being able to scale mining capacity in line with global EH growth, the share of block reward each miner earns becomes more difficult to acquire. We can see that playing out with Digihost which has seen declining BTC production over the last several months Summary Unless we get a drastic improvement in the price of Bitcoin, I can't see much of a reason to long DGHI at this point. And if that move up in BTC does occur, there are simply other miners that will benefit more because of the considerably larger BTC stacks that they hold relative to their market capitalizations. For example, Marathon Digital's ( MARA ) $1.3 billion market cap is backed roughly 24% by a $322 million unencumbered BTC position. DGHI simply doesn't have that backstop to drive valuation higher. In Digihost, I see a company that is probably going to lag mining peers. Because of the debt-free balance sheet, the company could theoretically be a buyout candidate for a larger firm that wants to scale with rigs that are already energized. But if there is any possibility of that, if I were a shareholder, I'd hope it happens sooner rather than later before more capital gets lost in call options.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4593101-digihost-technology-stock-warning-signs?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11609460.jpeg

11605334,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526174,1681102676,"Is Bitcoin Price Headed For A Correction Or A Breakout From $28,000?","The volatility of Bitcoin price has always been a hot topic in crypto, as BTC fluctuates rapidly because of various factors such as regulatory changes and market sentiments. As Bitcoin continues to gain mainstream adoption, the anticipation for its next move is at an all-time high. Bitcoin enthusiasts and investors alike are eagerly anticipating the next move of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, as it stands at a critical crossroad. While the long-term outlook for Bitcoin’s price remains bullish, the short-term trend is yet to be determined, leaving many wondering if the digital asset will manage to surpass its major obstacle of the $30,000 resistance level. Will It Be A Correction Or Breakout? As the market holds its breath, all eyes are on the demand and buying power, the ultimate determinants of Bitcoin’s fate. Will the buyers come in strong and push Bitcoin past its hurdle, or will the cryptocurrency market witness a correction? In the context of cryptocurrency, a correction refers to a temporary price decline in the value of a particular cryptocurrency or the entire cryptocurrency market, following a period of rapid growth. Corrections are a natural part of market cycles, and they can be triggered by a variety of factors, such as market sentiment, news events, or changes in regulation. During a correction, cryptocurrency prices may drop significantly, leading to a market downturn and a decrease in overall trading volume. However, corrections are often seen as healthy for the market, as they help to remove excess speculation and stabilize prices over the long term. Bitcoin Price Inches Upward Now, Bitcoin’s latest price update reveals a modest 0.98% rally in the last 24 hours, pushing the cryptocurrency’s value to $28,323, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite the seemingly slow progress, Bitcoin has also managed to maintain a steady 2.30% climb over the past seven days, hinting at the potential for a more significant surge in the near future. Source: CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s 4-hour timeframe chart reveals an ascending trendline that has been in place for several months and is presently propping up the price. The cryptocurrency’s current predicament, however, is that it appears stuck between the ascending trendline, which began at the $28,000 range, and the $30,000 price region. The significance of this crucial range cannot be overstated, as a substantial move above or below it will likely eliminate any lingering uncertainty and determine Bitcoin’s mid-term outlook. It’s a subtle yet encouraging sign for Bitcoin holders and traders, who are always on the lookout for any movement in the volatile crypto market. Weekly Analysis Predicts Bullish Movement For BTC Bitcoin’s daily technical analysis does not offer much insight into the cryptocurrency’s trend direction, but the weekly outlook paints a decisively bullish picture. This optimistic forecast is supported by several factors, including the weekly time frame, which suggests that Bitcoin’s price is set to climb toward its long-term resistance at $31,500.

If that happens, the cryptocurrency’s price could fall back toward the $20,000 mark. As always, the crypto market is volatile and unpredictable, and traders and investors should proceed with caution. -Featured image from CoinPedia",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-bitcoin-price-headed-for-a-correction/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

According to this report, data from Russia’s biggest mining company, BitRiver, shows that the Russian Federation attained a mining power of 1 gigawatt (GW) during the first quarter of 2023 to displace the Republic of Kazakhstan from its position. As expected, the United States still remains the largest crypto-mining nation with a capacity of 3-4 GW. That said, other nations that rank in the top 10 according to BitRiver’s report include the Gulf countries, Canada, Malaysia, Argentina, Iceland, Paraguay, and Ireland. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits All-Time High For The 4th Time In 2023: Here’s Why Russia’s Rise In Mining Power For some years now, Russia has held third place behind Kazakhstan and the U.S. However, the country’s recent change in approach towards the cryptocurrency sector appears to have begun paying dividends. Given the heavy international sanctions on Russia due to its ongoing war with Ukraine, the transcontinental nation began exploring the potential of this decentralized cryptocurrency world. This has led to the government creating an enabling environment for crypto-based activities, including mining. A good example of this is the subsidization of the operating costs of a 100-megawatts (MW) mining facility currently under construction in Siberia. These subsidies included slashed electricity costs, lower tax rates, and land and property tax exemption. However, it is worth noting that Russia’s rise to second place in mining power was also mediated by the introduction of stringent rules in Kazakhstan limiting mining activities. In late 2022, the Parliament of Kazakhstan introduced a law requiring crypto miners to obtain a license. This bill aimed to regulate mining activities and protect the nation’s energy supply. This law led to a drastic decrease in the mining capacity of Kazakhstan, with the Asian nation falling from the second to the ninth position in the top 10 crypto mining nations, according to BitRiver. Related Reading: Cardano’s TVL Set For Exponential Growth, TapTools Reports Could Russia Catch Up With the United States? Considering Russia’s latest feat, there are speculations about the country’s ability to catch up with the U.S. and maybe become the biggest crypto miner in the world. Ordinarily, one could say that Russia is well placed to attain this feat considering numerous areas in the nation present low electricity costs and a favorable climate allowing mining operators to avoid spending on cooling equipment. Moreover, the crypto mining industry in America is facing critical issues such as electricity price hikes, zero tax incentives and reduced profitability. In addition, the U.S. federal government has yet to determine the status of cryptocurrency and digital assets.

42412382,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4nOm,1681087818,First Mover Asia: Is a ‘Sharp Move’ Around the Corner for Bitcoin and Ether?,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade is a few days away, but that isn't translating into selling pressure because most staked ether is at a loss.  Insights: In his latest Money Reimagined column, CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey argues that the recent backlash against the crypto industry stems from the alleged misdeeds of disgraced FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,225 +11.6 ▲ 1.0% Bitcoin (BTC) $28,383 +355.3 ▲ 1.3% Ethereum (ETH) $1,863 +8.4 ▲ 0.5% S&P 500  4,105.02 +14.6 ▲ 0.4% Gold  $2,018 +6.1 ▲ 0.3% Nikkei 225  27,518.31 +45.7 ▲ 0.2% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,225 +11.6 ▲ 1.0% Bitcoin (BTC) $28,383 +355.3 ▲ 1.3% Ethereum (ETH) $1,863 +8.4 ▲ 0.5% S&P 500 4,105.02 +14.6 ▲ 0.4% Gold $2,018 +6.1 ▲ 0.3% Nikkei 225 27,518.31 +45.7 ▲ 0.2% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Is a Sharp Move in the Offing?  Good morning Asia.  Bitcoin is opening the Asia trading week up 1.3% at $28,383, while ether is up 0.5% to $1,863.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of the overall crypto market's performance, is up about 1%.  “The market leader has traded in a very tight range in the last week, barely moving much. Such consolidation, along with lowering volume, could indicate that a sharp move is around the corner,” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of Bitbull Capital, said in a note to CoinDesk.  DiPasquale said that a correction toward $25,000 wouldn't “break the bullish structure, whereas a move to $30K is likely to face resistance.”  “The market sentiment currently remains positive, and we may see select altcoins perform decently if bitcoin remains in the current range for longer,” he added.  Ether's relatively flat performance may allay fears that the Ethereum blockchain's Shanghai software upgrade, scheduled for mid-week, will bring selling pressure.  CryptoQuant wrote in a research report from February that the majority of ether staked was at a loss, with the average loss at 18%.  “Typically, selling pressure emerges when market participants are sitting on extreme profits, which is not the case right now for the ether that has been staked,” the firm wrote.

Last week, I warned of a dangerous politicization trend in U.S. crypto policy following a barrage of regulatory enforcement actions taken against this industry. I remain concerned about that trend, but my view is now slightly more nuanced thanks to the insights of two people with very good D.C. connections. They explained how emotions – specifically anger and embarrassment – played a huge role in driving those policy actions.  It reminded me of the importance of clear, inviolable rules of governance, whether they’re baked into democratic institutions such as the U.S. Constitution or forged into consensus mechanisms used by open-source software communities, like those attached to blockchain protocols.  Regulation by retribution  Among a string of “Thanks Sam” moments these past five months, this one takes the cake. You can argue that the crackdown against Kraken, Coinbase, Paxos, Binance and others was driven significantly by a desire to punish Sam Bankman-Fried, the erstwhile founder of FTX, whose mind-blowingly rapid collapse in November sent shock waves through the crypto industry.  This is how one of my sources described the mindset of Biden administration officials and of lawmakers from both political parties: “You can’t come into their house, slosh that kind of money around, leave politicians with egg on their faces and not expect to pay a huge price.” He was referring to the fact that before the FTX meltdown, politicians – mostly Democrats but also some Republicans – had been beneficiaries of more than $74 million in political donations from FTX and had forged connections with Bankman-Fried, who had wooed progressives with his “effective altruism” commitments. (A CoinDesk investigation found that one-third of Congress took money from Bankman-Fried or his associates.)  Find the full story here:  Important events.
