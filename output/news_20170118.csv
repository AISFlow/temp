42427279,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1BDh,1484778559,Coinbase Co-Founder Fred Ehrsam is Leaving the Company,"Former Goldman Sachs trader and Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam is leaving the San Francisco bitcoin startup for new opportunities.  Revealed to the company today via an internal meeting, Ehrsam told CoinDesk he intends to now ""step back"" from his daily duties at the end of January, take some time off, and potentially, plot a new venture in the blockchain industry.  ""There's a high probability it will be in the crypto space,"" he said.  Ehrsam will continue to hold a position on the Coinbase board.  When asked about the reasons behind the move, Ehrsam said that he believes both the company and the wider blockchain industry to be at an ""inflection point"".  ""This is the first time I've thought it could support a diverse set of businesses and ideas,"" he said.  Ehrsam first joined Coinbase at the end of 2012 after exchanging emails with co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong, who was then building the bitcoin wallet startup at Y Combinator. (Forbes has a longer profile of the story here).  Ehrsam said the move had been discussed for some time, and that, over time, he expects more employees will likely leave Coinbase for new ventures.  Coinbase's first employee, Olaf Carlson-Wee, for example, left the company in July to start a hedge fund focused on the trading of blockchain-based tokens, a funding model of which Ehrsam has emerged as a noteworthy proponent.  ""If you look at the really successful companies, the big ones that emerge in a whole new industry, the most successful ones throw off entrepreneurs,"" he said, adding:  ""It's like the PayPal mafia. We're creating the Coinbase mafia.""  During his time at the startup, Ehrsam made 30 Under 30 lists from publications including Time and Forbes, while also attending high-profile events as a representative of the company.  As part of the news, Coinbase also announced Mike Lempres will be joining as chief legal and risk officer.  The company added in a statement: ""Coinbase has never been in a stronger position and we are optimistic for 2017 and beyond.""

42427265,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Anh,1484776814,Fed Chair Yellen: Blockchain is an 'Important Technology',"Blockchain is an ""important technology"" given its potential impact on the global financial system, Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said today.  The remarks were issued during a speech at the Commonwealth Club, a US public affairs forum, in which Yellen took part in a question-and-answer session with club board chair George Scalise.  At one point, Scalise asked Yellen whether the Federal Reserve – which released its first major research paper on distributed ledgers in December – was looking at using the tech for its own purposes.  Here’s what Yellen had to say in response:  ""[Blockchain] is a very important, new technology that could have implications for the way in which transactions are handled throughout the financial system. We're looking at it in terms of its promise in some of the technologies we use ourselves and many financial institutions are looking at it. It could make a big difference to the way in which transactions are cleared and settled in the global economy.""  In a way, Yellen's remarks echo those given in September of last year, when the Fed chair told a Congressional committee that the tech could have ""very significant implications"" for the US payments ecosystem and beyond.  ""I think innovation using these technologies could be extremely helpful and bring benefits to society,"" she said at the time.  The Fed is currently pursuing additional research into the tech, with an eye to release a follow-up paper sometime this year.

42427273,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1B3h,1484767211,Where's Casper? Inside Ethereum's Race to Reinvent its Blockchain,"If you've been following ethereum at all, you're likely aware the blockchain project has a lot riding on something called 'proof of stake'.  A radical change to how the network forms consensus, the idea is somewhat simple in aim, but potentially history-changing in scope.  The story goes like this: As far back as2011, some developers began to worry about the energy that bitcoin – which uses a process called 'proof of work' (PoW) – would require at scale (some recently estimated that it would consume as much energy as Denmark). Further, bitcoin's mining firms were already becoming big businesses, and there was fear that this change would negatively impact user growth.  Sure, there is the argument that proof-of-work's competition created a more secure network (and that pegging mining competition to Moore's Law led to natural market regulation), but some were eager for a greener alternative.  Enter proof of stake.  To date, the protocol has been embraced by several projects (peercoin, NXT and others) but ethereum's transition would be unique in that it would essentially switch protocols mid-flight, so to speak. As a result, it's faced heavy criticism from those who long have alleged that both PoS, and ethereum's implementation, might not work.  The idea has been met its fair share of skepticism, partly because it's taking a long time to implement a version that developers agree is secure.  In late 2015, Bitfury Group released a white paper exploring the differences between PoW and PoS, and the attack vectors that could have destroyed early “naive” versions of PoS.  Yet, against this backdrop, ethereum developers have continued working on an alternative, arguing that they're making headway.  Work has gone through many iterations and materialized in an idea known as 'Casper', after the movie ghost, which ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has described as ""consensus by bet"".  Buterin told CoinDesk that the development process is now exploring how to incentivize the functioning of ethereum in a wholly new way, stating:  ""The development process involves heavy exploration of both economic and game-theoretic considerations and Byzantine-fault-tolerant protocols, trying to create a protocol that satisfies one of several constraints simultaneously.""  While Buterin's description may sound complex, what the statement essentially boils down to is that ethereum is still seeking to get its incentive scheme for its proof-of-work alternative right.  As far back as September, both Buterin and fellow developer Vlad Zamfir were working on competing implementations of the idea. Both are essentially betting that the cost of buying physical miners (as well as their competition) can be replicated virtually, given the right conditions.  Now, after years of research, Buterin said, he's ""quite confident on the general principle"" though ""details need to be worked out.""  Casper, explained  The team often holds public discussions on its research, and has posted three open-source simulations so far (the latest, posted in August, is here), which show how the protocol works and that it can converge on one history.  Recently, Buterin offered a research update covering the protocol, while Zamfir has been running a blog series on the history of his thought process. Developer Rick Dudley, computer science PhD student Loi Luu and others have also contributed to the protocol.  To recap, proof of work, used by both bitcoin and ethereum right now, requires a network of powerful computers to validate transactions, and proof of stake is another means to this end.  The goal of both is the same: for the nodes in the network to come to agreement on a correct transaction history.  PoS hasn't been easy to implement, seeing several stages of development since 2013, when Buterin stated that ethereum would ""likely"" switch from PoW.  The first of these stages, which they now call ""naive PoS"", suffers from what has been called the 'nothing-at-stake' problem. It doesn’t punish actors for validating more than one history — meaning the network could easily disagree on the real history.  ""This is clearly a fatal flaw for a technology whose raison d’être is to provide an undisputed canonical order of transactions,"" blockchain consultant Ciaran Murray remarked.  What separates Casper (and other more recent versions) from traditional PoS, is that it punishes participants who don't play by the rules.  Buterin described it with a rough analogy: imagine 100 people sitting around a circular table. One person has a bundle of papers, each with a different transaction history. The first participant picks up a pen and signs one, then passes it onto the next person, who makes a similar choice.  Each participant only gets $1 if they sign the transaction history that most of the participants sign in the end.  ""And if you sign one page and later sign a different page, your house burns down,"" Buterin added, arguing that this is probably a good incentive to sign the right piece of paper.  Remaining problems  But Buterin and others are working on a few remaining problems.  They come down to ""crypto-economics,"" a word often heard in the ethereum community to describe what could be an emerging field of study, focusing on how cryptography can be used to help steer participants in a certain direction with the right incentives.  The best-known example might be PoW, where miners have an incentive to play fair and validate correct transactions, or else they’ll lose money. It drives miners to act honestly by paying them bitcoin.  Buterin and others are trying to get players to continue to play by the rules without the miners.  For it to work, the validators need to behave politely, Buterin said. But, there are some situations where it's more difficult to concoct the right incentives.  One is that, once a block is 'finalized' or added to the blockchain, it shouldn’t be possible for a recent block to be replaced unless most of the validators (who are roughly equivalent to the miners) sign a second time to lose their deposits.  Another is that the validators should be barred from cheating competing validators out of their money (a problem called ""bounding the griefing factor"").  All in all, the way Vitalik sees it, there are three steps left: finalize the algorithm, review it and build a testnet, and then implement it across all seven of the ethereum clients.  Murray said:  ""In attempting to solve the nothing-at-stake problem, the cartel problem and the issue of finality, Casper promises to be, by a distance, the most advanced consensus mechanism to emerge in the public blockchain sphere.""  No deadline  Yet, it remains to be seen when that might be.  ""I prefer not to give timelines,"" Buterin said, though on social media he recently gave a perhaps too rosy estimate of late 2017.  If that's the case, even PoS's skeptics would probably rejoice.  ""If there was a proof-of-stake algorithm, I would probably support it,"" Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr said earlier this year on social media. Until then, he (and many others) consider it 'vaporware'.  For now, the ethereum community appears eager to see a final version.  However, Murray suggested that even then it will probably need further inspection, saying:  ”I’m looking forward to seeing a full specification of Casper available for peer review in order to ascertain if this complexity may create new problems of its own.”  Purple light image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/01/18/wheres-casper-inside-ethereums-race-to-reinvent-its-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a88df981b471f7e84b2906da2a5c2acde7239df2-2446x1284.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Central Bank of Nigeria’s Financial Policy and Regulation Department has released a new circular advising banks not to ""use, hold and/or transact in any way"" with the technology. The document cites bitcoin, onecoin, monero and dogecoin as examples, noting that banks that opt to handle digital currencies “do so at [their] own risk”.  Notably, the circular also calls for banks to keep tabs on any customers they may have that operate digital currency exchanges. Specifically, the central bank said that institutions should make sure those exchanges are adhering to AML/KYC rules. Those that aren’t in compliance, the Central Bank of Nigeria said, should have their accounts closed as a result.  The central bank went on to say:  ""Where banks and other institutions are not satisfied with the controls put in place by the virtual currency exchange/customers, the relationship should be terminated immediately….and any suspicious transactions should immediately be reported to the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit.""  The release comes more than a year after the central bank issued a call for new regulation for bitcoin. At the time, officials cited money laundering risks as a justification for pursuing possible regulation.  Other parts of the Nigerian government have moved to scrutinize the tech more closely in recent days as well. Earlier this week Nigeria’s top securities regulator warned local investors about buying digital currencies, citing local radio advertisements as a source of concern.

In reports today, the central bank is said to have found irregularities in the operations of major bitcoin exchanges BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin that it believes were the cause of abnormal fluctuations in the price of bitcoin.  Specifically, the report concludes that the companies were found to be carrying out margin trading activities, though no details on any punishments were issued.  The reports, by China-based news source Hexun and Jiefang Daily, further state that the platforms were also found to be operating outside of anti-money laundering rules, an area of concern the PBOC previously highlighted in public releases.  It further moved to warn investors about the downside risks of purchasing bitcoin, a product considered under Chinese law to be a ""virtual good"".  In statements, members of China's bitcoin community (perhaps unsurprisingly) sought to downplay the findings.  Eric Zhao, an engineer at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, for instance, told CoinDesk that the result was ""to be expected"", even though he acknowledged that the reports do not provide much detail on what was discovered.  China-based bitcoin mining firm founder Eric Mu, commented similarly, deriding the reports as ""nothing new"".  The news comes nearly two weeks after reports first surfaced that the PBOC had held meetings with the exchanges, a development that followed a rapid increase in the price of bitcoin at the start of 2017.  At press time, only BTCC had issued a formal response via its online Weibo account.  ""BTCC will continue to actively cooperate with the central bank and its associated departments and carry out rectifications. BTCC is currently operating normally,"" the exchange said.  CEO Bobby Lee would not confirm or deny any of the findings, but told CoinDesk that he is looking forward to the results of the report to determine how the market can best move forward in accordance with government guidance.  He added:  ""We're open to all ideas and modifications.""  At time of press, bitcoin was down nearly 5% on the day's trading.

42427266,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Aph,1484751798,Digital Trade Chain: 7 Banks Could Go Live With Blockchain in 2017,"Seven major European banks are partnering on a new blockchain-based trade finance platform, with a tentative plan to launch sometime in the second half of 2017.  Dubbed Digital Trade Chain (DTC), the initiative grew out of an earlier proof-of-concept spearheaded by Belgium-based bank KBC and first unveiled in July of last year.  Those backing the platform’s development are looking to establish a secure place to manage open account trade transactions for both domestic and international commerce. DTC utilizes a permissioned ledger, with authorized parties allowed to submit transactions on the platform.  Open account trade transactions involve products being shipped before the actual payment is due, meaning that trust among the transaction’s parties is imperative. With DTC, those plugged into the system will be able to track the progression of those transactions, from initiation to settlement.  Thus far, the banks involved – KBC, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Natixis, Rabobank, Société Générale and UniCredit – have signed a memorandum of understanding that lays out the basic groundwork for future development. That said, the banks are looking to launch DTC sometime in 2017, with an eye to building support in markets like France, Germany and the UK.  In statements to CoinDesk, the banks involved say the goal is to cut transacting costs for European businesses, particularly for more modestly sized firms.  Roberto Mancone, global head of disruptive technologies and solutions for Deutsche Bank, said of the initiative:  “The aim of the platform is to make domestic and cross-border commerce easier for European small and medium-size (SME) businesses by harnessing the power of digital distributed ledger technology.”  Shared costs  Following the expected launch later in 2017, in addition to major markets like Germany and the UK, countries like Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands are also being actively considered for roll-outs.  Andrew Betts, head of global trade and receivable finance for HSBC’s Europe division, said the 2017 release target was an ambitious but realistic one.  “It’s an aggressive timeframe but we believe it’s achievable,” Betts told CoinDesk.  That success, the banks indicated, will be incumbent, at least in part, on attracting a sufficient number of businesses to build a network effect.  ""For DTC to be successful, it needs to be available and accessible by a large number of SMEs – hence the importance of having a number of banks involved,"" Mancone explained.  To help meet that goal, the banks are backstopping the project with an undisclosed amount of capital, with each putting up an equal amount to pay for developers and other costs.  Mancone concluded:  “By pooling our resources, the platform has a greater chance of success.”  Image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/01/18/digital-trade-chain-7-banks-could-go-live-with-blockchain-in-2017,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/755bc1ae40f9fb3b8941af3c07f0ef85a0184da3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42427278,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1BBh,1484748913,Digital Asset's New Challenger: DLT Disillusionment,"Stakeholders at one of the first mainstream financial institutions to build with distributed ledger technology (DLT) are beginning to doubt its promise.  It's been just four months since New York-based Digital Asset Holdings commenced the formal process of gathering information from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), and reports are already beginning to trickle in that show how difficult the process is becoming.  But those involved say the stakeholder disillusionment is just part of the learning process.  Initiated in August, the partnership's ""stakeholder engagement program"", as Digital Asset CEO Blythe Masters called it, set out to ascertain from a wide range ASX users what it might take to build a blockchain replacement for the current industry-leading cash equity market, known as CHESS (the Clearing House Electronic Subregister System).  Consisting of dialogues with both users who ""directly connect to the system"" and those who otherwise rely on it, the engagement program is part of a lengthy process to try to ensure a blockchain platform that does more than just replace the existing system.  Digital Asset CEO Blythe Masters told CoinDesk:  ""The stakeholder engagement process is by no means concluded. One of the major objectives of our DLT platform is to reduce operational costs and complexity specifically for the customers of market infrastructure providers.""  According to Masters, DA is playing an assisting role in ASX’s project to help ensure the distributed ledger platform currently being developed exceeds the demands of the exchange's current customers.  ASX and Digital Asset have separately confirmed with CoinDesk that the engagement program consists of a ""purpose-built demo suite"", and that more than 50 presentations that have been made to help explain the technology to both customers and regulators.  Concerns raise  In spite of industry understanding that self-executing code deployed on a distributed ledger could lead to increased efficiencies, it turns out that some ASX stakeholders have expressed skepticism about how that might play out in the real world, according to a Financial Review report.  While exchanges with wider margins might provide greater opportunity for improvement, ASX is already one of the most profitable in the world.  Earlier this week, Accenture published a report that blockchain could save banks $12bn a year by simplifying a number of back-end procedures. But ASX is already generating more profit than 14 exchanges in a recent report, according to AFR.  ""There is a suspicion among the stakeholders who use ASX's services that [ASX CEO Dominic] Stevens will be under intense pressure to skimp on technology investment to preserve margins,"" the article reads.  ASX spent AUD $50.2m ($38.5m) on technology development in the previous fiscal year, at least part of which was dedicated to its investment in DA.  Ramping up  While the tone of the AFR report is occasionally dour, the effort to implement a blockchain-like solution on the cash equities exchange is only just beginning, those involved say.  Since stakeholder consultations first began last year, an ASX representative revealed to CoinDesk that the exchange has hosted a series of workshops and released a supplementary questionnaire as part of an ongoing process to learn how stakeholders might use a series of self executing contracts powered by DA’s Digital Asset Modeling Language (DAML).  In addition to the stakeholder engagement program, ASX’s Code of Practice Business Committee has formed a technical sub-committee to focus on adopting interbank messaging platform Swift's ISO 20022 messaging standard. Swift itself is experimenting with a possible blockchain implementation of the standard.  By August, ASX had completed its first DLT settlement prototype, and the following month, it set the date to make a final decision to implement — or not — by the end of this year.  ""There is already strong levels of interest and engagement from stakeholders,"" the representative of ASX told CoinDesk. ""We are listening and responding to the market's business requirements.""  Future milestones  Regardless of concerns raised by the unnamed stakeholders, we won't have to wait for long to learn more about the engagement effort.  The ASX representative told CoinDesk the securities exchange plans to release an update on the ""progress of its distributed ledger technology plans and partnership with DAH"" in its half-year results report.  The presentation is expected to be delivered on 17 February.  Even if the jointly created DLT platform wins the support of stakeholders, however, that process of learning from those who might use it is expected to continue.  The ASX spokesperson described the engagement effort to CoinDesk:  ""It is thorough, detailed and transparent, and will continue throughout 2017 and beyond.""

Yves Mersch, a member of the ECB's executive board, gave remarks during an event in Helsinki on Monday during which he discussed the prospects of central bank-issued digital currencies.  Mersch has given speeches on the subject a number of times in the past, including an appearance in December during which he disclosed that the ECB is working with Japan's central bank on blockchain research.  Tech aside, Mersch said that before any applications can be brought to market, potential bugs need to be rooted out. Otherwise, he warned, the ECB could do lasting damage to itself as an institution.  He told event attendees:  ""DLT carries great potential, but is it already advanced enough to be applied by central banks? Reputation is crucial for central banks. We cannot afford mistakes in the technologies we employ.""  Arguing that central banks have an interest in pursuing technology solutions that cut costs, he suggested that institutions like the ECB need to tread lightly during any possible roll-out.  ""Before the central bank can start providing digital base money (DBM) to non-banks, we need to be sure not only that DBM is unlikely to have negative economic side-effects, but also that the relevant systems are operationally efficient and safe,"" he said.

42421811,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXvPYr,1484740828,The Blockchain is Still Waiting for Its Web. Here's a Blueprint,"William Mougayar is the author of ""The Business Blockchain"" and a board advisor to, and investor in, various blockchain projects and startups (see: disclosures).  In this opinion piece, Mougayar examines what it would take to introduce technologies and standards that make blockchain as ubiquitous and user-friendly as the Web.  The blockchain landscape is still very technical. Aside from the early enthusiasts and pioneers, it is hardly comprehensible to the masses, and it will continue to be that way, unless it breaks out of its technical shell.  This isn’t unlike the predicament the Internet was stuck in, prior to the Web.  So, what if blockchain technology is more like the Internet, which means that we are still waiting for its Web layers to emerge, in order to fully exploit its capabilities?  Today, blockchain protocols, solutions or platforms are not straightforward to work with. At least, they require a good degree of technical know-how that far exceeds what an average Web developer or savvy semi-technical business person can do with the Web today.  But does it have to be that way forever?  Blockchains have many common features  If you examine the variety of available blockchains, many of them handle the same few basic functions, centered around recording (digital) value without requiring a third party to move it.  Outside of this core capability, a number of additional functions and features are typically found:  Central nucleus: records of value  Basic features layer: ownerships, balances, transfers, assets creation, time-stamping, security, programmability  Interaction layer: verification of transactions, proofs (of existence, or other), movement history, technical or business logic, storage, settlements, identity, naming.  If this set of functionality is generic in multiple blockchain platforms, why do we need many ways to call them up? Why not institute a common way to check identity, asset ownerships, time-stamping, etc, across any blockchain?  Note that I didn’t include cryptocurrencies, shared distributed ledgers, or even decentralized protocols in these layers because they are applications and outcomes of blockchains.  If you stand back from the nitty gritty of these layers, you will realize a key abstraction that is common to most blockchains: how they shatter the intermediary trust paradigm by enabling transactions to occur at the peer-to-peer level, without the necessity of central choke or delay points.  Since there is so much homogeneity in functionality intent, then why are there so many different and incompatible blockchain technologies and software? That’s because each blockchain implements these basic features and interaction layers in its own way.  Learning from the Web’s history  This scenario is not unlike the position the Internet was in, prior to the Web.  Tim Berners-Lee described that period well, circa 1989:  “In those days, there was different information on different computers, but you had to log on to different computers to get at it. Also, sometimes you had to learn a different program on each computer. Often it was just easier to go and ask people when they were having coffee…”.  Since millions of computers were already being connected to a fast growing Internet, Tim figured the way to solve this problem was to have them share information via an emerging technology he proposed, called hypertext (structured text that uses logical links between nodes containing text) that he described in a seminal 1989 document called “Information Management: A Proposal”.  The following extract is from WWWF's ""History of the Web"":  ""By October of 1990, Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s web (and which you may have seen appear on parts of your web browser):  HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The markup (formatting) language for the web.  URI: Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of 'address' that is unique and used to identify to each resource on the web. It is also commonly called a URL.  HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the web.”  As a footnote to this backdrop, Tim’s boss originally gave a lukewarm response to the paper, handwriting on it, “Vague, but exciting”. In truth, some vagueness in a protocol is a good feature, because it implies that its scope is widely encompassing, without being too restrictive.  One could argue that Satoshi Nakamoto’s paper was also vague, pertaining to the fullness of its targeted applications beyond the peer-to-peer exchange of electronic money. Ethereum, for example, was built specifically as a general-purpose blockchain platform environment, and didn’t want to be specific, as an original design objective.  Since their early days, the Internet and the Web have matured nicely, and today they both rely on close to 200 standards, categorized along the following segments:  Web layer: HTML, URI, Java, CSS and more.  Application layer: HTTP, DNS, FTP, SMTP, POP and more.  Transport layer: TCP, UDP, DCCP, RSVP and more.  Internet layer: IPv4, IPv6, IPsec, ICMP, IGMP and more.  Link layer: ARP, PPP, Ethernet, DSL, ISDN, FDDI and more.  [Derived from: Internet protocol suite.]  These standards are what make the Web work so well. When you are developing Web applications, setting up an infrastructure, or building new products, you interact (directly or indirectly) with these standards, knowing exactly what to expect.  Unfortunately, blockchains don’t have that luxury yet, as each platform is made up of its own set of technologies and methods to work with it, resulting in a Balkanized learning curve and adoption behavior for software developers and architects.  Blockchain technology is too fragmented  Each blockchain has its own set of technology tools, middleware and API’s that applications developers need to contend with. An engineer that knows how to program bitcoin needs to relearn what they know, in order to develop on other blockchains. For example, exchanges that support multiple cryptocurrencies have to deal with different integration technologies for each implementation.  It is true that each blockchain platform has developed its own technology stacks and interaction methods, but these are vertically integrated to themselves, and for their own ecosystem. In fact, most blockchain platforms don’t share that much in common, resulting in choice lock-ins, lack of interoperability and potentially dead ends that are hard to untangle.  The state of collaboration between blockchains is even worse, and plagued by timid efforts for building bridges and lateral co-operative capabilities. One day, it shouldn’t be inconceivable to have technology that crawls entire blockchains, in the same way that search crawlers spider websites to index or categorize vast content.  Of course, many technologies start by being proprietary. What follows is that some of them get adopted widely, and they become de-facto standards. In other cases, groups get together and agree to support a given standard, to serve everybody.  Today, not enough of the latter is taking place, although many leading blockchain technologies are hoping to gain enough market klout that would let them become that de-facto choice.  In hindsight, I wished we didn’t give up on bitcoin APIs so quickly. Two years ago, bitcoin APIs were all the rage with more than a dozen companies vying for that space, as the entry point to develop bitcoin applications. Then, the majority of them slowly opted out of that business, or stopped highlighting it as a key offering.  Today, we still have several (bitcoin) API-based offerings from companies like Factom, Tierion, Gem, Colu, BlockCypher, Neuroware, and Coinbase (to name a few). There are benefits to seeing a multitude of APIs take hold and get adopted. Even if some of them overlap in functionality, at least they will point to the need for an eventual standardization.  Bitcoin is making progress at its own pace, via technology releases aimed primarily at solidifying its own ecosystem. Although they have the largest cryptocurrency footprint, that doesn’t negate the need for their technology to also work with other parts of the overall crypto-tech ecosystem.  The decentralization of the Web rewires standards  In order to grow up, blockchains will eventually need a lot of standards that are vendor and solutions agnostic.  So many areas are ripe for standards developments: smart contracts, tokens, security, storage, messaging, identities, naming, record-keeping, and more.  The Internet and the Web have their standards. Where are the blockchain equivalent?  A standard set of middleware interfaces would insulate participants from the hardest parts of the technology, and expose more succinctly its utilitarian features. Lowering the barriers of entries would empower more developers to enter the blockchain, similar to the roles that HTML, HTTP, URLs and Java played for the Web.  Distributed applications that run on a blockchain infrastructure are architected differently than applications that were built for the Web’s architecture.  In a traditional Web application, you have client-side Javascript code that is run by users inside their browsers and server-side code that is run by a host or company. By contrast, in a distributed application, you have smart logic running on a virtual network of computers (the peer-to-peer network), and client-side code running in a special browser (or client), with the blockchain ledger acting as a shared resource.  With this new type of rewiring, comes the need to also rewire a variety of blockchain standards and technology layers.  Conceivably, blockchains could rely on a number of standards above the Internet’s existing standards, to allow a smooth bridging from one layer to another. That would be a breakthrough.  A blockchain universal stack could resemble something like this (basically, we would add three layers on top of the Internet):  Blockchain browsers (B-Browsers) are going to be important, as we will start to see them in 2017. They will be used to launch blockchain applications, and might look like normal applications we are familiar with, except that they will carry with them some new features that are enabled by blockchain back ends (instead of databases).  Some of the exciting new blockchain browsers to watch include MetaMask, Blockstack and Mist. These currently have a technical slant, and they are not yet geared at the casual end-user, but they will eventually evolve to become more end-user friendly.  A new breed of blockchain applications will come in the form of peer-to-peer browser experiences (eg: OpenBazaar), while another type will be bolted straight on the current Web, but with a blockchain back end (eg: Steemit).  A trust services layer could be that API veneer that homogenizes how we create, move, check states, inspect proofs, follow historical paths, etc: that is, perform the functions that blockchains handle well.  Blockchains interoperability is inevitable, but we don’t know exactly yet at what levels, unless we get closer by iterating near the real friction points.  Discrete efforts are not enough  Nothing great has ever been adopted widely all over the world, unless it was somehow homogenized to make it easily assimilated by the masses.  We need universal tools that no one owns, but that benefit everybody, similar to the Web technologies that liberated the Internet.  Tim Berners-Lee explained why this was so important for the Web:  “Had the technology been proprietary, and in my total control, it would probably not have taken off. You can’t propose that something be a universal space and at the same time keep control of it.”  There are promising examples of blockchain related standards, and we need to see more of them.  In the de-facto category, two notable mentions are IPFS (Inter Planetary File System), and an Ethereum-led token issuance standard, labelled ERC20 (which is becoming a de-facto standard in Initial Cryptocurrency Offerings).  IPFS is not just focused on the blockchain, although they are a good match, as IPFS has proven to be popular with blockchain applications (eg: OpenBazaar), where permanent IPFS links get placed into a blockchain transaction.  A few consortiums have also placed blockchain standards on their working agenda, and I enumerated them in my ""State of Global Blockchain Consortia"" article.  In the industry-led camp, we will need to follow the ISO/TC 307 Blockchain and electronic distributed ledger technologies technical committee who has stated their serious intentions by partaking in the blockchain standards roll call.  On the enterprise-side, the jury is still out, as vendors place their software in open source repositories, or declare an open standard with a handful of their customers, in the hopes of letting this work become a real standard via sheer adoption – eg: Hyperledger, Digital Assets, Chain, and R3.  Placing software in the open source realm is a good practice, but there is a difference when it starts that way from Day 1 (eg: bitcoin, ethereum) versus doing it a posteriori to gain more market acceptance.  Furthermore, I am a firm believer that private and public blockchains need to also share common standards. It would be inconceivable that the Internet and private intranets wouldn’t interoperate or interconnect at the very least; yet, we are building private and public blockchain technologies and applications without due regard to the inevitability of that intersection.  Let’s not compete on standards  Yes, I am seriously talking about standards. It is not too early, even if I thought last year that we shouldn’t rush blockchain standards before their time. In 2017, we will need to start seeing serious discussions about universal standards, along with real intentions from industry participants to work together for that aim to materialize.  We need to realize that, in addition to competing in the marketplace, we have to also cooperate on common technical objectives.  In an ideal world, the blockchain field would produce an orderly architecture stack that carries popular standards, commonly used by all of its participants. It would be the resulting mix of de-facto and industry-led standards.  As a side benefit, the existence of standards could also lubricate network effects, a much needed success characteristic. In turn, that would entice new marketplace entrants to focus on their differentiation, instead of building the same overlapping technology pieces.  You don’t typically win by competing on standards, yet you don’t know what is a standard initially, so you might start by competing on everything. A sign of industry maturity will be seen when we hear of companies dropping certain proprietary technologies in favor of cooperative efforts.  That said, we shouldn’t suspend everything in order to just work on standards in a vacuum. Vendors and blockchain core developers must continue to work on their own technologies while closely monitoring adoption, and always being sensitive about opportunities for industry collaboration. We can’t force standards on the market, but the market will need to embrace standards over time.  If blockchain technologies ignore the eventuality of standards, we are going to see less adoption.  Maybe we should think of the blockchain as a public good utility, and encourage an evolution that is not unlike the Internet’s, in terms of openness and neutrality of access.  Will the collection of blockchain technologies turn into another giant Internet, or will their journey unfold into a messy and fragmented evolution, like the database market, prior to its consolidation?  We have had the blockchain for a while, and it is gaining adoption. New and exciting applications are being built on blockchain technologies. Now is the time to realize that the blockchain’s best future days ahead will depend on how well we expose its capabilities more universally, and more openly. If not now, when?

42427264,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Ajh,1484737203,Overstock’s TØ Blockchain Platform Acquires Market Data Firm,"Blockchain-powered securities trading platform tØ has acquired the assets of a Singapore technology firm as part of plans to enhance its information services.  The firm, Blue Ocean Financial Technology, is a finance data service provider, with a special focus on delivering information related to US securities.  Using the Blue Ocean assets, tØ – which is backed by online retail giant Overstock – is setting up a new company outside of the US, with an eye to use its infrastructure to deliver real-time market information.  TØ president Joe Cammarata said in a statement:  “Blue Ocean Technologies will provide investors in the rapidly growing Asian region with an avenue to execute U.S. equities during their usual business hours. This concept is the first of its kind, and has already attracted the attention of several large market-making clients to provide daily liquidity within our platform.”  Overstock has acquired other firms, including Wall Street brokerage firm SpeedRoute, as part of the build-up of the platform.  The firm’s Medici division launched tØ to great fanfare in mid-2015 after the e-tailer first began to work on securities trade tools a year prior.  Last year, Overstock used its tech to kick off its own blockchain-based securities offering, going on to raise about $1.9m by way of shares sold on the platform.
