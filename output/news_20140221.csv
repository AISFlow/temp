42376919,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l48R,1393023123,New Documents Show Goldman Sachs is Discussing Bitcoin,"New York-based global investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has completed an initial assessment of digital currencies that concluded they are currently too volatile for serious investors.  The news comes from noted online news source TechCrunch, which says it obtained a copy of an internal discussion document from a contact at Goldman Sachs.  The excerpts posted by the media outlet provide evidence that Goldman Sachs is currently looking into the currency, though it is uncertain about its benefits. The bank even went so far as to suggest that it remains confused by the uproar surrounding virtual currencies.  Said one excerpt:  “2013 was the year when Bitcoin became a mainstay in mass media, to the extent that it has become hard to separate the effect of hype surrounding the currency from its fundamentals.”  While the bank's major findings noted a laundry list of the virtual currency's shortcomings, it acknowledged some of the potential benefits of bitcoin. In particular, it noted bitcoin's ability to remove processing costs from micropayments and to provide ""anonymity, security and a natively digital experience to online transactions for consumers"".  The news comes just weeks after JPMorgan weighed in on bitcoin with a more formal report that labeled digital currencies as ""vastly inferior to fiat currencies"".  Notable findings  Ultimately, the report concluded that bitcoin is not yet suitable for merchant use due to its price volatility. This was a criticism also held by JPMorgan, which suggested that this risk outweighed the benefits of any potential savings.  On the matter of consumer use, Goldman Sachs determined that ""there are more speculators in bitcoin versus participants in e-commerce"". The comments indicate the bank believes bitcoin needs to attain a greater level of liquidity before it becomes useful as a currency, though reports suggest that this shift may already be occurring.  Indeed, the bank found that bitcoin lacks a number of other attributes that could make it attractive to investors:  ""There is no liquid derivative market for Bitcoin; nor a large market of B2B suppliers which companies can use for spending Bitcoin.""  Opportunities  The report summaries suggest that Goldman Sachs believe bitcoin to be far from a point of mass adoption, but that significant opportunities could one day exist in the ecosystem for investors.  The document said:  “As a full suite of financial services build up around Bitcoin, there will be numerous (mostly commission- based) revenue opportunities investors can focus on, including providing exchanges, wallets, payment processing, lending, derivatives and other services.""

42376913,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l40t,1393014605,Bitcoin Investor Syndicate Breaks into AngelList Top 10,"A bitcoin syndicate cracked AngelList's top 10 for the first time on 21st February, just one month after it was initially formed.  Created by bitcoin venture capitalist Brock Pierce, who founded ExpressCoin, GoCoin, KnCMiner and Robocoin Asia, the syndicate now ranks eighth in terms of its total monetary backing, with $501,250 from 23 backers.  Syndicate backers include BitAngels Fund managing director David Johnston, SilkRoad Equity co-founder Matthew Roszak and 500 Startups venture partner Sean Percival and SIM managing partner W Bradford Stephens.  The syndicate will support 12 bitcoin-related startups this year, with an average of $50,000 being awarded to each company. Companies must contribute to digital currency in order to be eligible for the funds.  Angels can join the syndicate with a minimum investment of $5,000.  The announcement comes amid increasing investor activity in the virtual currency space. Notably, SecondMarket's Bitcoin Investment Trust recently passed 80,000 BTC in holdings, while Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss just this week submitted a revised filing for a public bitcoin ETF.  How AngelList syndicates work  AngelList allows any angel investor or fund to form a syndicate, and for backers to then invest alongside them so that they can collaborate on future deals.  As explained by AngelList, ""backers get access to dealflow, leads get carry and startups get access to capital"". Backers pay 5-20% carry per deal to the syndicate lead, and 5% to AngelList for facilitating the deals.  Investors are first screened through a verification process, and a special purpose vehicle LLC is created for each investment. Due to US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, only 99 investors can participate in the syndicate, meaning that Pierce's fund has already reached one-quarter of its maximum capacity.  About the investors  In addition to Pierce, the syndicate includes a noted cast of virtual currency investors. For example, Percival is an advisor for San Francisco-based wallet provider Blockchain.info.  Likewise, Roszak is an investor in digital currency e-commerce and gaming provider GoCoin.com.

42376918,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l47B,1393011284,BitPay Updates Wallet for Smoother QR Code User Experience,"Georgia-based bitcoin merchant processing provider BitPay has announced the launch of the Bitcoin Payment Protocol, a wallet update designed to eliminate the ""human error in making a bitcoin payment"".  In the official announcement, the company said the update would reduce friction at the point of sale by eliminating the need for consumers to copy the address and amount into their wallet. At checkout, users who scan a QR code or click to initiate payment will only be presented two options, pay or don't pay.  Though this may sound like a small improvement, Stephen Pair, CTO and co-founder of BitPay, explains these errors can create inefficiencies that can bog down the payments network.  ""We see common errors that people make. Some people pay too little or too much to a BitPay invoice, so that creates a payment exception that requires a support ticket.""  These leftover payments not only detract from the customer experience, however, they also have broader implications for how BitPay interacts with the mining community.  Notably, the update comes just one week after it launched Bitcore, an open-source project for app developers, and as the company is onboarding more merchants than ever.  BitPay has estimated that it now brings on 1,000 new merchants a week.  Reduced consumer friction  BitPay said that the new update improves the usability of QR codes for bitcoin payments by supporting BIP 73, an enhancement to the payment protocol BIP 70. BIP 73 seeks to reduce the density of QR codes.  The company said that this will ensure its QR codes work better in low-light settings and at longer distances. Further, they come with advantages for first-time users, as they are also normal HTTP URLs that can send instructions to devices.  The Payment Protocol makes improvements to ease merchant-seller disputes, too, as it supplies a refund address along with each payment.  Explained BitPay:  ""This approach to refunds works on the block chain, with any wallet software, and does not require the buyers to have a BitPay account.""  For a more on BIP 73 and its technical improvements, you can find a detailed overview here.  A market for transaction fees  BitPay explains that the big picture behind the update is that it eliminates the Bitcoin mesh network that had previously helped communicate transactions between both senders and recipients and originators and the mining community.  Explains Pair:  ""With the payment protocol, you communicate the payment from sender to recipient directly [...] so the wallet can send it to BitPay and then BitPay broadcasts it on the mesh network.""  This direct communications path, Pair said, helps BitPay account for nodes that may require certain fees in to maintain their profitability.  Pair went to on to detail how this would take the guesswork out of determining the fees for a transaction to get included in a block, help to develop a market around processing transaction fees and allow BitPay to better ensure these transactions can be sent through a block within a desired timeframe.  ""Creating a true market for transaction fees, is really where the market needs to evolve,"" Pair said.

42376921,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l4Ax,1393008126,Has This Company Found a Workaround for Mt. Gox Withdrawals?,"A new market will allow Mt. Gox customers to trade funds in their exchange accounts for bitcoin, effectively allowing bitcoin withdrawals despite an official freeze.  The service, Bitcoin Builder, has also created an arbitrage opportunity for traders who wish to exploit the growing spread between the price of bitcoin on Mt. Gox and other major exchanges.  According to the market's founder Josh Jones, some 14,500 BTC (about $8.1m) worth of trades have been executed since it was set up on 11th Feb.  A widening spread  Bitcoin Builder works by taking advantage of the widening spread between the price of bitcoin on Mt. Gox and other exchanges. The spread has grown as Mt. Gox’s withdrawal freeze stretches on. At the time of writing, for example, 1 BTC was trading for $123.56 on Mt. Gox compared to $566.20 on BitStamp.  Traders on Bitcoin Builder can sell bitcoins in their Mt. Gox accounts on the Bitcoin Builder market at the prevailing price. One bitcoin in a Mt. Gox account was trading for 0.38 BTC on Bitcoin Builder at the time of writing.  If the same bitcoin from Mt. Gox could theoretically be traded on another exchange, like BitStamp, it would be worth just 0.22 BTC. In other words, selling Mt. Gox bitcoins on Bitcoin Builder yields a 73% premium over the theoretical open market rate. Jones said:  “I was in the withdrawal queue for Mt. Gox when all this happened. I was basically a user who wanted an exchange like this to exist myself.”  Bitcoin Builder works because Mt. Gox is still allowing transfers between accounts on the exchange. To sell bitcoin, users must therefore send coins to Bitcoin Builder’s Mt. Gox account. They will then receive bitcoin in a wallet of their choice.  Only users with ‘verified’ or ‘trusted’ accounts at Mt. Gox can make transfers to another account on the exchange. The new exchange charges 2% for each transaction.  Bitcoin Builder also allows traders to buy the discounted Mt. Gox bitcoins. These traders must deposit coins with Bitcoin Builder and then receive Mt. Gox bitcoins that are held in Bitcoin Builder’s account on the exchange.  Traders on Bitcoin Builder must also submit identity documents before they can start making transactions.  The Gox question  Trades on Bitcoin Builder hinge on Mt. Gox’s future. Customers who are selling their Mt. Gox bitcoins on Bitcoin Builder are taking a 78% discount on the price of their coins in exchange for the certainty of holding funds that are not subject to Mt. Gox’s withdrawal restrictions.  Although the exchange has said the withdrawal freeze is due to technical problems and that it will be lifted soon, customers appear to be losing their confidence that the exchange will do as it says. This is reflected in the plummeting price of bitcoin to US dollars on Mt. Gox.  Then there are the arbitrageurs who are able to exploit the spread between prices at Mt. Gox and other exchanges so long as the withdrawal freeze stays in place.  These traders may be depositing fiat into a Mt. Gox account in order to buy more discounted bitcoins and then offloading them on Bitcoin Builder. With bitcoins in hand, they can then make a profit selling on another major exchange.  However, if Mt. Gox were to announce more serious problems — such as insolvency, for example — then Bitcoin Builder’s trading volume would vanish. Jones said:  “If Mt. Gox really is insolvent, or if they somehow freeze Bitcoin Builder’s account, or if they say that some of these bitcoins turned out to be fake because of transaction malleability, then there’s going to be a lot of angry people [on Bitcoin Builder].”  Jones himself is betting that Mt. Gox is solvent and that it is indeed suffering from the technical problems it claims it is experiencing.  “There is a saying, ‘never attribute to malice that which can adequately explained by incompetence'. Mt Gox is not Google or Apple. But they are a real company and Karpeles has made loads of money over the last few years. So he’s not just going to shut it down,” Jones said.  About Josh Jones  Jones claims he knows a thing or two about running a high-growth technology company with an inexperienced team – which is what Mark Karpeles is being accused of at Mt. Gox.  Jones is one of four co-founders of Dreamhost, a web hosting company that was formed when the group were computer science majors at Harvey Mudd College in California.  The company was founded in 1997 and now has revenues of $45m, according to Jones. Like Mt. Gox, the firm did not raise funds from professional investors.  “I just think [Karpeles] is just really bad at PR. At Dreamhost I’ve had PR disasters myself. We made a billing error and we over-billed people millions of dollars, and we weren’t as apologetic as we should have been. Immediately, it was like, oh, that didn’t go down well!”  Jones stepped away from operational duties at Dreamhost in March 2010. He said he sold his shares in the company in November, but he uses his track record with the web-hosting firm to prove that Bitcoin Builder should be trusted by its customers.  “That’s why I put my LinkedIn profile and my real identity on the Bitcoin Builders site. I started the LA Bitcoin meet up, I ran Dreamhost. People were already trading on forums, and I was like, man – people are just trusting some dude on a forum. So people are trusting me,” he said.  Jones said he did not know Karpeles personally, except for an email exchange two years ago when Bitcoin Builder was initially launched as a tool to allow automated bitcoin buying on Mt. Gox.  He said Karpeles had emailed him suggesting ways they could make the tool more efficient and split the revenue. Jones then proposed investing in the then-nascent exchange, but Karpeles never responded.  Potential risks  Trust has to be abundant when trading on Bitcoin Builder. For example, customers selling their Mt. Gox bitcoin must transfer their coins to the Bitcoin Builder account with no guarantee that they will receive coins in return.  Bitcoin Builder processes withdrawals daily, at 11pm Pacific Standard Time. Customers selling bitcoin therefore potentially have to wait for an anxiety-laden 24 hours before their wallets outside Mt. Gox are credited.  One Bitcoin Builder trader, who runs a ‘bitcoin hedge fund’ in New York City, says he was reassured by Jones’ transparency about his identity. The trader, who wished to remain anonymous, said:  “[Jones] is a public person with a reputation and a career — so I am willing to believe that he is not a scammer. Like anything, you make sure everything works first with a small amount.”  The trader said he had purchased more than 300 Mt. Gox bitcoins through Bitcoin Builder.  Jones is running Bitcoin Builder by himself at the moment, having written all the software that the site runs on. He is considering adding more features, like leverage and automated withdrawals.  In the meantime, the exchange is doing booming business, and providing a valuable opportunity for Mt. Gox customers to get their funds out.

42376910,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l3zd,1393003842,Why Facebook’s $19 Billion Acquisition of WhatsApp is Meaningful for Bitcoin,"Nick Tomaino is currently on the business development team at Coinbase, and is also a first-year business school student at the Yale School of Management. Prior to that, he worked in venture capital, most recently for Softbank Capital.  With Facebook's $19bn acquisition making headlines yesterday, WhatsApp has become the first truly successful consumer technology company to avoid advertising as a business model.  Instagram  and a few other early stage companies have been acquired advert-free (and thus without revenue), however, WhatsApp generates millions of dollars directly from its users and has always been committed to protecting these consumers from advertising.  The company makes its money by charging consumers 99 cents to download the application, which allows them to completely remove advertisements from the equation. WhatsApp’s ability to make its users the customer rather than the product is one of the main reasonsthe team was able to build such a phenomenal company.  WhatsApp’s story highlights the beginning of a major shift in consumer technology – away from advertisements and towards direct-to-consumer monetization through micropayments.  Financial mismatch  A massive shift to direct-to-consumer monetization for consumer tech companies could be really good news for the bitcoin world.  The primary reason that advertising has been the business model of choice for consumer tech companies in the 25-year history of the Internet, is that the existing financial infrastructure is not built for the Web.  It’s generally a difficult and time-consuming process for a consumer to enter credit card information and make an online payment. Additionally, micropayments (generally considered payments under $1) are not economical for merchants to accept because of the fees on the merchant side.  Stripe  and PayPal, for example, charge a 30-cent fixed fee per transaction, and that fee is standard for all the ‘traditional’ payment processors.  This friction has forced consumer technology companies to rely on the advertising business model, which makes the advertisers the customer and the consumers the product.  Need for change  Online advertising has persisted for these reasons, even though it is generally detested by consumers and also prevents companies from maximizing the time spent building great products. Effectively, it forces engineers to focus on satisfying the advertisers by data mining, rather than satisfying the users by building a better product.  Micropayments  can change this, and WhatsApp clearly demonstrates that the change is already happening on mobile with existing financial infrastructure.  Apple typically charges developers 30% of app profits, and it’s likely that’s what Apple charges WhatsApp on every 99 cent purchase of the application. Of this 30%, a significant portion (around 20%) goes towards credit-card processing fees.  While WhatsApp was able to successfully utilize this direct-to-consumer micropayment business model without bitcoin, there is still too much friction in this equation, and for every WhatsApp there are thousands of app developers that can’t successfully monetize due to the significant fees that still exist.  Enter bitcoin  Bitcoin removes the friction associated with online payments. Transactions on the Bitcoin network are instant, irreversible, and almost free of charge, making micropayment business models much more economical for merchants.  Major media companies, like the Chicago Sun-Times, are already experimenting with bitcoin-enabled micropayments for this reason, and the early results have been promising.  Bitcoin also allows consumers to make payments more efficiently, and companies like Coinbase offer two-click checkout and OAuth (an open standard for authorization) features, which make the online payment experience seamless.  Bitcoin applications are prevalent in the Google Play store, and the industry is continually trying to help Apple understand the power of bitcoin.  Regardless, though, it will probably soon become apparent to consumers and merchants that bitcoin is the most efficient way to transfer money online for micropayments.  This will ultimately make the Internet a more enjoyable place by helping to significantly reduce advertisements from consumer technology companies.

42376926,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l4HF,1392997069,‘Building the Payments Web’ Event Shines Spotlight on Cryptocurrencies,"An event titled ‘Building the Payments Web’ took place in San Francisco yesterday, with a focus on digital money and cryptocurrencies.  The half-day symposium featured a discussion panel, an introduction to a promising payment protocol and a pitch competition.  It was held in conjunction with DeveloperWeek, a conference and events series that attracts a total of 2,500 developers each year.  Introduction and panel  'Building the Payments Web' was sponsored by Ripple Labs, a company that has built its own payment protocol alongside a digital currency – also named ripple, or XRP.  Ripple Labs’ Chris Larsen kicked off the event with a brief introduction. This was followed by an hour-long panel discussion titled ‘The Year Payments Came Online’.  The panel consisted of; Jered Kenna, CEO of TradeHill and Money & Tech; Chris Larsen co-founder and CEO of Ripple Labs; Tom Longson, CEO of GogoCoin; and Jesse Powell, co-founder and CEO of Payward/Kraken. Dan Held, co-founder of Zeroblock, served as moderator.  Technology  During the panel, the relationship between financial technology and cryptocurrency entered the fray, with Longson arguing that technical wizardry won't necessarily lead to adoption: “It’s about serving people’s needs the best, it’s not just about the best technology.”  Longson's company GogoCoin allows people to use digital currencies with prepaid cards. He said distributed money promises the ability to “pay people all over the world like we’ve never been able to”.  Early adopter Jered Kenna told the audience he was ""really fortunate to find out about bitcoin in the beginning”. He currently runs 20Mission, a co-working and living space that helps to foster the startup community in San Francisco.  Kenna was also able to simplify recent innovations in financial technology, using a single sentence he pointed out that:  “Money is just a database entry”  Building company and regulation  Many people are starting to see the potential of digital money. But far fewer understand what it really takes to build a company around bitcoin. Kenna, who was a co-founder in the now-dormant exchange TradeHill, offered the audience some advice: “Do not start an exchange.”  He talked about how legal costs can mount up when building an exchange.“Lawyers are insanely expensive,” he said, explaining that they can charge over $20,000 to draw up one document. He added: “Keep it as simple as possible.”  Larsen, the Ripple CEO, told the audience that he is “pretty optimistic about regulation”. As a result, he encouraged the developers at the event to stay focused on a product and not on regulatory issues.  “Don’t let it intimidate or slow you down,” he said.  Larsen then spoke briefly about his belief in the eight second rule: the idea that a product or service should be understood by a customer within eight seconds.  Altcoins and the unbanked  The potential for distributed systems to help the underserved is immense. Some of the digital payments entrepreneurs at the event talked about cryptocurrency's ability to reach the unbanked population.  “FinTech may be boring, but it moves people,” said GogoCoin's Longson. He believes the opportunity is large: “There is a huge number of people around the world that are unbanked.”  On a different note, Powell, who runs San Francisco-based Kraken, told attendees that his exchange is now open for doge business, although he's not sure what to think of the fledgling currency:  “I don’t know if [doge] offers a lot, other than it is funny”  Powell also pointed that it is too early to say whether many of the emerging altcoins will succeed over time. He pointed to Ethereum specifically, saying that it is “months away” from having software that is ready.  Pitch contest  After lunch came the pitch contest. Contestants were given two minutes to pitch concepts for the digital payment sector. Some of the ideas included: hosted Ripple wallets, voting applications and emergency debit cards.  1st place winners received 500,000 XRP, 2nd place 300,000 XPR and 3rd place was awarded 200,000:  1st place: Ripple Hedge Fund  2nd place: Fuzz Labs  3rd place (tie): Bitwal and Dave Cohen, who pitched a digital currency voting system  About Ripple Labs  Ripple is a 40-person company based in San Francisco. Larsen, its CEO, has been involved in financial technology companies in the past, most notably Prosper, a peer-to-peer lending marketplace.  The company has raised over $6.5m in venture capital funding in several rounds. Its backers include Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Venture Partners.  Stefan Thomas, CTO of Ripple, also made a presentation during the event which uncovered Ripple's mission in greater detail.  He talked about Ripple as a ""protocol for moving value,” something that has been in demand: ""People have dreamed of this for a long time.""  Larsen told CoinDesk that Ripple Labs is looking to nurture development and help accelerate startups in the digital payments space. Because of this, it is actively looking for ideas that are anchored by solid teams.

42376928,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l4Jl,1392993173,"Mt. Gox’s Lesson in Logic, the ATM that Doesn’t Exist, and Tips for the Future","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 21st February 2014 – a regular look at the hottest, most thought-provoking and most controversial events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of scepticism and wonder.      Your host … John Law.    Unfair exchange of views  John Law is nothing if not internationally minded, which doesn’t seem to come naturally to many.  He is much amused by the knots his fellow Britons tie themselves in when they try to work out whether they should be in the European Union (“NO!” cry many on the right) or whether Scotland should leave the UK (“NO!”, they wail again – apparently because it wouldn’t then be in the EU. You try and work it out).  Such responses are emotionally led. The economics of the UK being in the EU aren’t much in dispute – far better in than out, and few really argue the opposite.  However, politics remains primarily emotional, for all it pretends otherwise, and it’s wise to recognise the fact.  Much the same tension between heart and head characterises these early years of bitcoin. On the one hand, bitcoin is a flaming beacon for freedom and escape from the cold hand of the state. On the other, bitcoin is a flaming nuisance, because big names are rather too free and too good at escaping from the cold hand, etc.  Mt. Gox  is the current attractor for this lightning storm. Following a long and bumpy history of not actually performing its primary task of exchanging bitcoin and fiat currency, it has lost almost all of its credibility among customers – and quite possibly their money too.  At the time of writing, the nominal price of Mt. Gox bitcoin holdings is about $135, or around a fifth of what the cryptocurrency is costing on other exchanges.  The reason, of course, is you can’t actually get bitcoin from Mt. Gox. It’s rewriting its software, or moving offices, or requiring new verification, or is in bed after eating a poisoned cheese sandwich, or something. All while holding millions of other people’s money.  This is upsetting those with an exposure to the troubled exchange - or ‘Gox suckers’, as they are probably already known in disrespectful quarters.  Many are angrily complaining that there was no way that such a sorry situation should have been allowed to develop. “The company is trading while insolvent, they cry, and that’s illegal.” “Send the feds in!” Another wail of pain is, “Why has the Bitcoin Foundation stood by instead of doing something?” “Daylight robbery!” fume still others.  John Law has much sympathy for anyone whose finances have been hit with the misery stick. He carries many such scars himself.  Yet he suggests those in high dudgeon should read up on the old notion of caveat emptor – let the buyer beware. An early Roman approach to consumer protection, it basically states that if you should know what you’re getting yourself into, you’ve got no redress.  More recently, of course, the rule of law has swung firmly in the customer’s favour by making sellers provide honest information and stick to the rules.  You can’t really complain about regulation being a brake on freedom, and then complain when it’s not there to save your backside. Well, you can – and plenty of politicians will take advantage of your hurt feelings either way – but it does reduce the number of legs to stand on to approximately zero.  And if you are determined to get legless, John Law can suggest some far less expensive, yet more enjoyable, ways. Expect Mt. Gox to receive some concentrated legal attention at some point, whatever happens, Which, in lieu of getting your actual money back, may be the best time to follow that particular piece of irresponsible advice.  Spies, UFOs and the invisible ATM  The speed at which bitcoin technology is advancing is breathtaking. As John Law pointed out a couple of weeks ago, it is possible through bitcoin to build an ATM for a small fraction of the cost of a traditional cash dispenser, and to run it for virtually nothing.  The whole thing can fit in a shoebox and be run from anywhere. What could be more efficient?  How about a virtual ATM, that doesn’t actually exist? This is the thinking behind Azteco, which to the casual eye looks like a small shop with a bloke, a laptop and an inkjet printer.  Admittedly, shops, printers and even blokes don’t come for free, but they are common enough and can do lots of other things. It’s the incremental cost of turning the lot into a bitcoin ATM that matters, and this is, effectively, zero. Nothing is needed but a chunk of software – and the bloke wrote that.  It works quite simply. Go into the shop, and give the bloke some money. He trousers the dosh and taps on the laptop. This prints out a voucher. Take that home, go onto the Azteco website, tell it the code on the voucher and your bitcoin wallet address. Ker-ching. (Bitcoin, of course, makes no noise. This is artistic licence.)  John Law is unsure exactly why you can’t just give the bloke your bitcoin wallet address in the shop. His laptop is clearly on the Internet, and you could – one presumes – just ask to borrow it for a second and do the transaction there and then.  But there is a certain atavistic pleasure in getting a physical something for your money and having to complete the rite at a later date.  Azteco is connected to Irdial, a name very familiar to John Law. He owns perhaps the most famous product connected with that name – The Conet Project on Irdial Discs. This is a set of CD recordings of ‘numbers stations’ – shortwave broadcasters run by spooks that transmit coded messages around the world.  Nobody officially knows who runs them or why they’re there. During the pre-Internet Cold War days, however, they were the most efficient untraceable way to send commands and messages to spies. The UK still has one called the Lincolnshire Poacher, named after the short tune that precedes transmissions, which transmits from Cyprus, but heaven knows who it’s aimed at.  Such oddness sits well with Irdial, whose audience is similarly difficult to ascertain. Irdial maintains a blog long on impassioned creeds on libertarianism, home schooling, the madness of governments and UFOs.  The most popular category is called Politricks with over four hundred entries, then Someone Clever Said and Insanity – presumably, though, not their own.  However, the whole thing is infused with a certain lightness of spirit and joie de vivre, which marks it out from the infinite number of knotted-brow thunderous libertarian blogs from the other side of the Atlantic.  If you had to pick someone to create a non-existent ATM that nevertheless works but really looks like a rather sketchy shop in the East End of London, you couldn’t do better than Irdial.  The chief characteristic that distinguishes science from religion is that the science works for you whether you believe in it or not – and the basic idea of bitcoin will work no matter how it’s presented. Message ends.  A tip for the future  One thing that Irdial’s blog commends is the use of bitcoin to civilise Internet discourse, and that’s a very sane aspiration.  It points out that by allowing readers to upvote comments on community sites by tipping the originator a small amount of cybercurrency, only those that genuinely seem valuable will be promoted – and people will concentrate on writing such posts, instead of yammering away with trollish unpleasantries.  This meshes well with a more general observation, that one of bitcoin’s primary uses in the real world isn’t speculation or buying stuff, but tipping. It’s a good match – informal, anonymous and efficient. Perhaps the most important aspect, though, is that there’s no third party.  It really is as intimate as giving a busker 50 pence: no banks or logins, no middleman taking more of a cut than the recipient gets.  This too is a form of voting. If maximising income is the aim, a busker soon gets a feel for what attracts the largest volume of payments and can choose to play the most popular tunes.  Those buskers that wilfully play what they like are doing so at personal cost – and thus demonstrating a certain integrity towards their art, which the passer-by can immediately appreciate even if they don’t like the music. That integrity pays less well than populism will come as no surprise to anyone familiar with humans.  However, what the bitcoin-as-vote has that the plain bitcoin-as-tip does not, is the ability of the passer-by to see how popular something is. A bitcoin tip jar gives no public indication of popularity, unlike an open guitar case well sprinkled with pound coins.  This is easily fixed with a bit of software, recording transactions and displaying a figure on the host website. Things get a lot more interesting if such figures are searchable, raising the possibility of automatically generating charts of who’s output is most popular web-wide.  Such an idea would go a long way towards solving another problem of online content – finding stuff that’s worth your time. A popular site with lots of tips would attract attention without having to market itself.  Although it may seem as if such a thing would be easy to game, much like the pop charts were susceptible to record companies targeting the right shops and buying lots of their own products, it would be harder to disguise organised tipping as the pattern of donation size, frequency and origin could be checked in the same software as displays the tip total in the first place.  Such an idea would go a long way to counterbalance one of the more regrettable aspects of the Web, that those with the biggest budgets can organise the best search engine optimisation and thus the biggest artificial profile.  Profoundly democratic, anti-marketing and intrinsically rewarding to the worthy. It’ll never catch on.  John Law is an 18th Century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler.

42376927,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l4IV,1392987628,"Meet DopaMINE, the Boutique GPU Mining Chassis","GPU mining has seen better days but, with the advent of scrypt-based altcoins, it is going through a renaissance. This time around, though, the hardware makers are ready – which wasn’t the case in the good old days of bitcoin GPU mining.  Several companies are currently trying to gain a toehold in this niche market, and some are getting quite creative.  The DopaMINE is Red Harbinger’s first crack at the boutique mining chassis market, which doesn’t exactly exist yet, but the company thinks it should. According to the DopaMINE Indiegogo page, the first units should ship in April.  Muscle and aesthetics  The DopaMINE is a huge chassis, reminiscent of high-end PC towers, but it is quite a bit different than your standard PC box. It can accommodate up to six graphics cards, and not just any cards: high-end ones, like the Hawaii-based Radeon R9 290X/290.  Sticking six high-end GPUs into a single chassis isn’t as easy as it sounds. For example, a single 290X can consume up to 300W of power running under full load, which means you can forget about running them on a single power supply unit.  The DopaMINE can handle two PSUs, but even so miners will need to choose carefully and go for high-end models with the highest possible efficiency rating. Tahiti and Hawaii Pro cards are a bit less power hungry, but not by much.  Another problem is cooling. Keeping six monster GPUs cool necessitates a lot of airflow, so the chassis features three 120/140mm fan mounts on the bottom – which would not be enough if the chassis was not completely open.  Providing enough airflow for six high-end cards in an enclosed chassis was probably too challenging for DopaMINE. Besides, miners don’t tend to care about acoustics, so they probably won’t mind the extra noise.  The chassis supports practically every motherboard standard out there, from mini-ITX to E-ATX.  Rack on  Our biggest concern doesn’t have anything to do with the specs – it’s the price. Red Harbinger won’t have an easy time selling DopaMINE units at $250 apiece.  Unlike gamers, miners simply don’t care about aesthetics and build quality. Many miners improvise, using homemade chassis or buying relatively cheap ones online. Miners are all about return on investment, not good looks.  However, the DopaMINE has a clever trick up its sleeve. Since it is a proper high-end chassis, it can take a lot of punishment and users can stack a few units on top of each other.  While this seems like a nice way of saving space, cooling could again be an issue. The heat from the units at the bottom could heat up the units on top of them, so more airflow would be necessary.  So, although it would be possible to rack and stack numerous GPUs in tight, enclosed spaces and tiny rooms, the heat would be unbearable and the room would need plenty of air conditioning. Still, this is an option if space is at a premium.  The future of GPU mining  The first scrypt ASICs are just around the corner, but questions about their effectiveness and efficiency persist.  Red Harbinger is also promoting this chassis as a testbed or a standard open-air chassis, just in case GPU mining proves to be a dead end. However, at this point it is not easy to say whether this will happen.  The whole idea behind scrypt and other emerging crypto standards is that they can’t be ‘beaten’ by ASICs, as a way of levelling the playing field and keeping mining decentralised.  In addition, even if some of these currencies can be crunched using ASICs, it usually takes on the order of several quarters to roll out a new ASIC for a new hash. GPUs are flexible – they can mine scrypt one day, and something new the next day.  New rivals  For years AMD had a clear advantage in the world of GPU mining. For a number of geeky reasons, AMD Radeons are just better at it than Nvidia Geforce cards.  However, this appears to be changing. Nvidia’s new Maxwell architecture was designed with power efficiency in mind. The first card based on the new architecture launched this week.  The GTX 750 Ti is based on the GM107 core and is not a high-end card, but it is extremely frugal and its performance-per-watt is impressive – much better than you would get on a comparable Radeon built on the same 28nm TSMC node.  The problem is that there are no high-end Maxwell cards, and there will not be any until later this year.  Nvidia will not build high-end Maxwell cards using the 28nm node, it will wait for TSMC’s 20nm high-performance node, which is almost ready, but not quite. It should be ready for full-scale production sometime in the second half of 2014.  However, by the time Nvidia launches high-end GM200 series products based on Maxwell, AMD will also transition to 20nm with a tweaked Hawaii architecture, so it shouldn’t have much trouble maintaining its lead in the GPU mining niche.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/21/meet-dopamine-the-boutique-gpu-mining-chassis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3646bfdea3ba754bb7a9fd3999e5f985ebdcc52f-1000x611.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376912,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l3yN,1392976806,Top UK Payments Body Weighs in on Bitcoin’s Future,"The Payments Council, the organisation that sets strategy for payment mechanisms in the UK, has issued a statement saying that it is “neutral” on bitcoin, though it sees “opportunities” for digital currencies.  In response to questions from CoinDesk, the Payments Council said that it had been tracking the progress of digital currencies “with interest”, and that bitcoin was one of many “competitive offerings” that are emerging in the UK.  The organisation appeared to be relatively positive on the future of digital currencies:  “As shopping habits are increasingly moving across borders and continents, it seems certain that there will be real opportunities for virtual currency providers who are outside of traditional domestic banking systems.”  The council’s statement also noted that digital currencies, like other payment services, would be driven by consumer demand.  The council appeared to be using the terms ‘digital currency’ and ‘virtual currency’ interchangeably in its statement. CoinDesk refers to bitcoin as a ‘digital currency’.  About the council  The Payments Council is the governing body for UK payments systems and services. As such, its task is to lead the development of future payment systems and regulate the accountability and transparency of existing systems. It is a voluntary organisation with a membership comprising banks and building societies, including HSBC, Nationwide Building Society, Citibank and others.  Among the schemes that the Payment Council operates is the LINK ATM scheme, which ensures cash cards issued by banks, building societies and other institutions can be used across different ATMs. Almost all of the UK’s ATMs are connected to the LINK network.  The council sets rules on the security of transactions, customer data and fees charged.  Common interests  The council has an interest in promoting speedier Internet transactions. Under the Faster Payments Scheme, launched in 2008, Internet and phone payments for individuals and businesses in the UK saw transaction times reduced from three working days to several hours.  The system was designed to allow quick transactions for amounts of less than £100,000 (US$166,680).  The council is now working on a UK-wide mobile payments scheme that will allow consumers to send secure payments to mobile phone numbers instead of a bank account number. The council promises that this process will be “as easy as texting”. Some 90% of UK current accounts will be able to do this when the scheme is launched this spring.

42376925,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l4Fz,1392956152,"Mt. Gox Bitcoin Price Falls Below $100, its Lowest Level Since July","The price of bitcoin on Mt. Gox dropped below $100, hitting a low of $91.50 on 20th February.  Data from Bitcoincharts indicates it was the lowest total observed on the exchange since 22nd July when the lowest price was $89.80.  The announcement comes amid increasing criticism from the bitcoin community about the exchange and its questionable behavior that has included ignoring protestors, blaming the Bitcoin protocol for its implementation issues and somehow managing to create an aura of suspicion and uncertainty around even its physical address.  Earlier this week, Blockchain.info chief security officer Andreas Antonopoulos went so far as to label Mt. Gox ""clownish"" and ""incompetent"" as part of the latest episode of the popular podcast Let's Talk Bitcoin, which was dedicated to dissecting problems at the exchange.  The developments are just the latest in a string of setbacks that have spawned community outrage at both the exchange and CEO Mark Karpeles in the last few weeks. Some community members have even called for Karpeles resignation from the Bitcoin Foundation in light of the recent developments, though the organization has not yet weighed in on the gathered petitions.  Prices stable elsewhere  At press time, the uncertainty around Mt. Gox and its solvency seemed to be affecting other exchanges, though only marginally.  Prices at both BTC-e and Bitstamp were roughly $400 greater than those at Mt. Gox. The figures are particularly stunning, given the exchange's reputation for high prices compared to other exchanges.  BTC-e opened at $542 on 20th February and at press time had fallen to $539. Similarly, Bitstamp dropped from a high of $561 to $553 at press time.  Community reaction  News that Mt. Gox had fallen under the $100 mark was quick to arrive on reddit, with many community members debating the right investment strategy as well as the motives of Mt. Gox in the wake of the most recent setback.  Some maintained that the market would soon rebound sharply once the situation was resolved, while others suggested the resulting negativity surrounding the market would push fringe bitcoin users away, perhaps for good.  However, notably there seemed to be a growing opinion that Mt. Gox's low bitcoin prices may actually be a better reflection of bitcoin's value.  This minority cited that fact that prices were at or near current prices before China's influence on the market and the swell of optimism that came with bitcoin's rising prices toward the end of 2013.

42376911,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6l3x7,1392955871,Gavin Andresen to Bitcoin Companies: Support Open Source,"Lead developer Gavin Andresen chided the commercial bitcoin community for not getting involved enough in core bitcoin development and testing this week. In a mail to the bitcoin developers list updating the community on some bug fixes in the code, he called companies out for not giving back.  The mail started out serenely enough, as a general update on what the team has done to fix some immediate transaction malleability issues in the reference version of the bitcoin client software. But it had a sting in the tail:  ""Testing and code review is, as always, the bottleneck for getting out a release with these changes. We have a chronic problem with people running bitcoin services on top of the core code waiting until there is an 'official' release, and then assuming that somebody else has done the hard work of reviewing and testing the changes.""  ""YOU SHOULD NOT BE MAKING THAT ASSUMPTION!"" he added, arguing that companies calling procedures in the bitcoin software might trigger some unlikely bug.  When a software engineer speaks in all-caps, you can tell that they're frustrated.  A tough month  It's been a tough month for the core development team. Mt Gox's cessation of bitcoin withdrawals, which it blamed on a long-known flaw in a software component used by the bitcoin network, bought to light a range of problems associated with double spending.  While by no means fatal, they were irritating enough for the Bitcoin Foundation to address them in a public statement.  [post-quote]  The latest missive highlighted some immediate work that had been done on the bitcoin wallet to change the way that it handled these issues.  They had been low priority, Andresen said, because they were ""edge cases"", meaning that they wouldn't happen in the normal course of operation.  They would only occur if users did unsupported things. In any case, he said, they were fixable using what he described as a ""heavy-handed workaround"".  But software engineers generally like things to be nimble, and elegant, and so the team got to work on it. It resulted in three broad fixes, which would help to 'de-confuse' wallets that didn't know whether their coins were spendable or not.  On of the fixed blocked one of the easiest ways to mutate transactions on the bitcoin network, and Andresen said that many big mining pools were already running this patch.  Time to give back?  But the community has to play ball, Andresen said, by helping to test the fixes out, rather than just running services on top of the latest version of the code and hoping that the team had fixed problems for them.  ""Or, in other words: do not treat the core development team as if we were a commercial company that sold you a software library,"" he wrote. ""That is not how open source works; if you are making a profit using the software, you are expected to help develop, debug, test, and review it.""  BitPay, the payment processor that employed core developer Jeff Garzik last May, was quick to respond.  ""Every serious bitcoin company should employ a core dev,"" said CEO Tony Gallippi. ""Jeff has been fantastic and continues to spend most of his time working on bitcoind and the bitcoin core, and much of the upstream developments that BitPay needs to succeed.""  Peter Gray, co-founder of Canadian company Coinkite, which makes an online wallet to support its bitcoin debit card and POS system, explained that his firm uses its own implementation of the bitcoin protocol in custom-built software, and doesn't rely on the core bitcoin RPC interface that Andresen describes.  Nevertheless, Gray believes Andresen has a point:  ""I do think that Gavin is right to complain about these companies which rely so heavily on open source and don't contribute back,"" he said. ""My hope is those same companies are supporting the Bitcoin Foundation financially, and the Foundation, in turn should be funding full time programers and testers.""  Responsibility  Should the Bitcoin Foundation be partly responsible to help ensure the health of the core protocol and reference clients, by encouraging input from industry? The Foundation didn't return CoinDesk's request for comment, but Garzik did.  ""The Bitcoin Foundation itself is somewhat limited by community ethos. Few people want to centralize a large number of key engineers at the Bitcoin Foundation, which then comes into accusations of 'controlling bitcoin' rather than simply being one-of-several bitcoin advocacy organizations,"" he said.  Wendell Davis, the founder of Mac OS X-based wallet Hive, admitted that his company hasn't contributed to the bitcoin source tree:  ""Gavin is completely correct of course; they are not a vendor and should not be expected to deliver like a vendor.""  He continued to liken bitcoin to Linux. If Red Hat - which profits from the open-source operating system - didn't contribute both QA and source improvements, Linux would be far less secure, and more buggy.  ""That said, speaking from the perspective of a very small company like Hive (which by the way uses bitcoinj rather than bitcoind, which Gavin is responsible for), it is usually a non-trivial matter to thoroughly go about this kind of work, when you already have your hands full enough at your own 'layer',"" argued Davis.  Perhaps that's the problem - bitcoin is a startup currency, in the early stages of disrupting an entire economic model. Lots of people are busy trying to build out its commercial infrastructure.  The question is, how many of them have the time or the funding to support the core technical one? And what happens if the pressure continues to fall upon a small cadre of hard-working, largely unpaid developers?
