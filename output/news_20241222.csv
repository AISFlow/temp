Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/daddy-pepe-daddpepe-solana-memecoin-to-surge-11000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The comments came from the country’s Deputy Minister of Energy Denis Moroz. The Deputy Minister said that Minsk is now “meeting with” crypto mining “investors.” Per BelTA , Moroz said that the government is holding “consultation” sessions with unnamed parties. Mining firms are also “analyzing” possible sites for new “farms” in Belarus. Belarus Courting Crypto Miners? Government officials have noted that crypto miners are already consuming 120 MW of electricity. Moroz said: “Crypto mining is a promising sector, and it has been given a new lease of life in Belarus.” Denis Moroz, Belarus’ Deputy Minister of Energy. (Source: Oblgas/YouTube) Moroz added that the Ministry of Energy only wants to work with players who are “interested in working long-term” in “the Belarusian energy system.” The Deputy Minister also insisted that incoming crypto miners should also help “create the necessary infrastructure” to help Minsk foster the size of its crypto mining capacity. “We see very big prospects. We have received many requests. I think that we will see new projects launch in the near future.” Denis Moroz, Belarus’ Deputy Minister of Energy Nuclear Power Bonus Moroz added that “until recently,” it has been impossible to understand which power sources miners using were to power their grids. While Belarus has sizeable renewable power generation operations, most of its energy mix has traditionally come from imported gas. However, the Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant (also known as the Astravets Nuclear Power Plant)’s first unit came online in June 2021. The Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant. (Source: DBatura) Minsk got a fresh inflow of power when a second unit entered commercial operation in November 2023. And, Moroz, said, this had now “created conditions” whereby Belarusian officials can now offer “incentive tariffs” to attract “crypto miners to the country.” The new power plant is fitted with two VVER-1200 reactors, both built using the Russian AES-2006 design. Its total capacity is 2400 MW, officials claim.

The Deputy Minister added that these “new tariffs for crypto miners” are “linked to consumption volumes.” Moroz said that “the more electricity miners consumed, the lower the rates they would have to pay.” Potential customers could include a number of bigger Russian players, who are already looking beyond traditional hotspots like Siberia. Donald Trump has threatened tariffs if BRICS countries try to form a dollar rival. He's worrying about the wrong threat, says @mihirssharma https://t.co/C4ZefV0ky4 via @opinion — Bloomberg (@business) December 16, 2024 Siberian power providers have complained that crypto mining puts an unacceptable strain on their power grids in the winter months. Russian authorities have responded by issuing temporary bans on crypto mining in the winter months in many Siberian regions until 2031. In recent months, BitRiver, the biggest Russian crypto mining firm of all, has unveiled plans to team up with the Russian government in a bid to build crypto mining centers in BRICS states . Belarus announced in mid-November that it has officially been granted BRICS “partner country” status. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko this year said he wants to go a step further. The veteran leader says he hopes to secure full BRICS membership in the near future.

37983058,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632070,1734910109,"President Trump announces members of his Crypto Council, with Bo Hines as the Executive Director","President Donald Trump has officially announced the lineup for his newly minted Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, also known as the ‘Crypto Council.’ Leading the charge is Bo Hines, a 29-year-old Yale graduate and former congressional candidate. He will serve as the council’s Executive Director, working alongside Trump’s ‘Crypto Czar,’ David Sacks. The goal is to cement America’s dominance in blockchain and digital assets while driving innovation in a sector that Trump says will be a “cornerstone of our nation’s technological advancement.” “I am pleased to announce the brilliant team that will be working in conjunction with our White House A.I. & Crypto Czar, David O. Sacks,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. “Together, we will unleash scientific breakthroughs, ensure America’s technological dominance, and usher in a Golden Age of American Innovation!” Bo Hines: Trump’s choice to lead the Crypto Council Bo’ appointment has raised eyebrows, but Trump seems confident in his decision. Bo, who played football at Yale before earning his law degree from Wake Forest, brings a unique background to the role. In 2022, he ran as a Republican for North Carolina’s 13th congressional district but lost to Democrat Wiley Nickel. While Bo’ crypto credentials aren’t public, Trump has made it clear that his trust in Bo stems from his potential to deliver results in this high-stakes role. Meanwhile, Sacks has stood proud in his love for crypto. He first invested in Bitcoin literally two years after it was invented. “Bo will work with David to foster innovation and growth in the digital assets space,” Trump said. “Together, they will create an environment where this industry can flourish.” The council’s work will also align with Trump’s broader tech ambitions, which include advancements in artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies. A star-studded tech lineup Michael J.K. Kratsios has been tapped as the Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and will serve as an Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. She’s gonna be part of the Council too. Kratsios is a Princeton graduate and Stanford Fellow, and he is no stranger to Washington. During Trump’s first term, he served as the United States Chief Technology Officer, a position unanimously confirmed by the Senate. Later, he took on the role of Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, where he earned the Department of Defense’s Distinguished Public Service Medal. Another member is Dr. Lynne Parker, who will join the administration as Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology (PCAST) and Counselor to the OSTP Director. Parker previously led the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office. She holds a PhD in Computer Science from MIT and has been instrumental in shaping U.S. AI policy. Trump emphasized the importance of PCAST, saying it will bring together “America’s most distinguished minds in science and technology.” David Sacks will also chair PCAST, doubling his responsibilities as a central figure in Trump’s tech agenda. Next is Sriram Krishnan, a former Microsoft engineer and founding member of Windows Azure, will serve as Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence. Working closely with Sacks and Parker, Krishnan will help coordinate AI policy across the government. The crypto market’s mixed reaction The announcement comes during a turbulent time for the crypto market. Bitcoin is on track for its first weekly decline since Trump won the election victory. It has dropped over 7% this week, sitting around $95,000 as of press time, down from its record high of $108,000 on December 17. Ether and Dogecoin have seen steeper declines, with a wider crypto market gauge falling by 10%. Analysts point to the Federal Reserve’s hawkish tone and also its dismissal of Bitcoin as a major factor. Despite this, Trump’s genuine pro-crypto stance has kept the market incredibly optimistic in the long-term. Another one of the president’s key priorities is extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which is set to expire in 2025. “We must act to ensure that the tax cuts I implemented continue to benefit American families and businesses,” Trump said today. He’s also proposed eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, introducing tax deductions for car loans on American-made vehicles, and reducing the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% for U.S. manufacturers. Trump is also targeting clean energy tax incentives established under the Biden administration, which he argues have led to higher costs for consumers. “We cannot allow these subsidies to distort our energy market,” he said. He has proposed eliminating “double taxation” for Americans living abroad, simplifying their tax obligations and ensuring they aren’t penalized for their global ties.

37983057,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631773,1734909810,Why UK Gen Zers favour brick-and-mortar banking in an era dominated by digital finance,"Young people in the UK, especially Gen Zers, are bent towards physical banking. The preference of the 18 to 24-year-old age group has evolved as they appreciate the convenience of digital tools but value the trust and personalization that comes with in-person banking. Their drive to in-person banking is the advice they get from the bank and a sense of engagement. The approach has made the bank branches a centre for advice rather than transaction spots. The blend of physical and digital , “Phygital” approach might bring back life to bank branches in 2025. The World Economic Forum advises on how to cement the new order: To build lasting relationships with Gen Zers, however, banks need to combine their physical presence with a competitive, exciting digital offering. Banks must also provide services that satisfy Gen Z’s demand for convenience, choice, value, sustainability, and hyper-personalization. ~ World Economic Forum Modern Banks are customizing services to fit clients’ needs Modern branches customize services extensively. Most are transforming into financial experience hubs. They drive tech-enabled consultations like video conferencing while also offering physical education workshops. These steps ensure that both demands are met, with room for the human element to guide one in making difficult financial decisions like a mortgage or wealth management. Gen Zers appreciate the digital world but also recognize that physical spaces are integral in fostering trust. The deeper customer relations emanating from brick-and-mortar banking are a great motivation for the young generation. Banks also take commendable steps to ensure they provide relevant services to Gen Zers. With the pattern, it is not easy to wish away physical banking any time soon. Is Gen Zer’s physical banking desire a threat to crypto? Gen Zers are drawn to physical banking for various reasons, but the convenience of accessing safety boxes is a unique one. Besides, it’s easier to process documents while present physically, which saves time. They also get a lot of free advice there. The desire for physical banking does not negate their drive for cryptocurrency, which is digital money. A survey done in the US supports the claim that Gen Zers embrace crypto more than any other group. Although the report says more than 50% of America’s population recognizes that cash is king, different demographics have different trends. Digital wallets and contactless payments are the hallmarks associated with young generations, including the Gen Zers.

The market is brimming with promising projects, but some have caught the eye due to their unique features and forward-thinking strategies. Among them, Qubetics (TICS) , Avalanche, and Aptos stand out. Each of these projects has carved its own niche, establishing themselves as major players in the cryptocurrency space. Qubetics, a rising star in the blockchain ecosystem, is grabbing attention with its innovative approach to smart contract creation, multi-chain integration, and an ongoing presale that’s raising serious eyebrows. If you’re considering long-term investment options, Qubetics is hard to ignore. Let’s dive into how this project stacks up against the likes of Avalanche and Aptos, both of which have already made a significant impact on the market. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, this comparison will help you understand which of these projects might be your next big opportunity. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Blockchain with Innovation and Accessibility Qubetics is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about names in the cryptocurrency space. In its 13th presale stage, the project has already raised over $7.5 million, sold more than 367 million $TICS tokens, and gained a growing community of 11,300+ holders. Priced at $0.0342 per token in the 13th stage, Qubetics offers a lucrative opportunity for those looking to get in early. This phase will soon see a price increase of 10%, and analysts predict the $TICS token could reach as high as $1 after the presale ends, offering a 2820% return on investment. One of the core features that make Qubetics an exciting option among the best cryptos to invest in for long term growth is its focus on blockchain accessibility and interoperability. The platform is designed to integrate seamlessly with multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others. By utilising the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Qubetics ensures that developers can easily build decentralized applications (dApps) and integrate tokens across various platforms without a hitch. This interoperability is a game-changer, as it removes the silos that currently exist in the blockchain ecosystem and allows for greater scalability, security, and efficiency. But it’s not just the technology that makes Qubetics stand out. The platform is also fully cross-platform compatible , available on iOS, Android, and desktop, ensuring accessibility no matter where you are or what device you’re using. Plus, it’s compatible with Apple Pay and Google Pay, making transactions smoother and more convenient . This will have a massive impact on businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. Imagine being able to execute blockchain transactions on the go, without worrying about whether your device or wallet supports the transaction. For businesses, this means greater flexibility when paying or receiving payments in $TICS tokens, enabling them to reach a broader audience. Qubetics isn’t just about technology—it’s about making blockchain accessible to everyone. It’s bringing forward Web3 integration to create an all-in-one platform that bridges the gap between multiple ecosystems and drives greater adoption of blockchain technology. Qubetics’ network architecture further enhances this potential by building a Web3-aggregated chain, which unifies disparate networks into a single, interoperable platform. This is a crucial step in ensuring the seamless transfer of assets, data, and cross-chain transactions. The result? A platform that facilitates collaboration across ecosystems and enhances the scalability of decentralized technologies. With so much potential, Qubetics is certainly one of the best cryptos to invest in for long term growth. Avalanche: Dominating the Blockchain Landscape Avalanche has long been considered one of the best cryptos to invest in for the long term, and for good reason. The blockchain platform has made waves with its speed, scalability, and low transaction costs. Avalanche introduced a revolutionary consensus mechanism that allows it to handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS), something Bitcoin and Ethereum can only dream of. This scalability has made it a favourite among DeFi (Decentralised Finance) developers and institutions looking for efficient and secure blockchain solutions. In recent years, Avalanche has also gained traction as a go-to alternative investment. It’s no surprise that institutional investors have shown a keen interest in this blockchain, as it offers both security and scalability—two critical factors for any financial institution looking to tap into the crypto market. With its unique architecture and focus on creating subnets (custom blockchains), Avalanche is poised to continue expanding its ecosystem and establishing itself as a key player in the global crypto market. Avalanche’s market position is further cemented by its continuous growth in total value locked (TVL) across decentralised applications. This metric shows how much capital is being deployed on Avalanche’s network, and it’s been steadily increasing, indicating that more and more users are seeing the value in Avalanche’s offerings. Analysts predict that Avalanche’s TVL could reach new heights, further strengthening its position as a top-tier blockchain. For those looking to diversify their crypto investments, Avalanche represents an excellent alternative to traditional stocks and bonds. With its high scalability and low transaction costs, it’s well-positioned to serve the growing demand for decentralized applications. Whether you’re a DeFi enthusiast, an investor looking for long-term growth, or a developer wanting to build on a highly efficient blockchain, Avalanche is one to watch. Aptos: The New Kid on the Blockchain Block Aptos has been making waves since its mainnet launch in 2023, positioning itself as one of the best cryptos to invest in for the long term. With its advanced, high-performance blockchain, Aptos aims to provide a scalable and secure platform for decentralized applications. The project was created by former Meta (Facebook) employees, which gives it a unique edge. Aptos combines years of experience in building scalable infrastructure with cutting-edge technology, making it one of the most promising blockchains in the space. Aptos’ most notable feature is its Move programming language, which is designed to make smart contract development more secure and efficient. Move allows for better execution of transactions and improves the overall performance of decentralized applications. Developers who are looking for an alternative to Ethereum’s Solidity will find Aptos’ Move language particularly attractive due to its focus on safety and flexibility. The Aptos blockchain has already gained traction in the DeFi sector, where its scalability and low fees have attracted both developers and investors. Its fast finality and ability to process thousands of transactions per second have made it a favourite for projects that require high throughput. As the demand for blockchain solutions continues to grow, Aptos is well-positioned to take advantage of the increasing appetite for decentralized finance, gaming, and other blockchain applications. Looking at its market performance, Aptos is a strong contender in the race for long-term investment opportunities. Its unique value proposition, coupled with the backing of industry veterans, makes it one of the most exciting projects to keep an eye on. As more users adopt Aptos and its ecosystem continues to grow, the token’s value is expected to rise, making it a smart choice for investors looking for alternative assets in the crypto space. Conclusion: The Future of Crypto Investment So, which of these projects should you invest in for the long term? While Avalanche and Aptos offer proven track records and established market positions, Qubetics is the one to watch in the coming years. With its focus on interoperability, cross-platform compatibility, and a robust Web3 ecosystem, Qubetics has the potential to revolutionise how blockchain networks communicate with one another. The presale is a golden opportunity for early investors, and with analysts predicting astronomical returns, it’s hard to ignore the growth potential of $TICS. If you’re serious about diversifying your portfolio and gaining exposure to the future of blockchain technology, investing in Qubetics presale could be your ticket to massive returns. Avalanche and Aptos are solid picks, but Qubetics represents a new frontier in blockchain development. Whether you’re looking for immediate gains or long-term growth, now’s the time to act. So, what are you waiting for? Get in on the action and invest in the best cryptos to invest in for the long term today!

As the market faces a bearish phase, certain meme coins are defying the odds, proving they’re more than just internet jokes. Among these, BTFD Coin (BTFD) has skyrocketed in popularity, with its presale exceeding $4.3 million in just over a month. Meanwhile, Memecoin (MEMECOIN) and Ponke (PONKE) are holding their ground, rallying their communities to weather the storm and come out stronger. Meme coins have evolved dramatically over the years. What started with Dogecoin as a playful experiment has transformed into a booming sector of the crypto world. These tokens now offer ecosystems with real utility, staking rewards, and innovative use cases. BTFD Coin is leading this charge with its P2E game, referral programme, staking opportunities, and the irresistible BIG50 bonus code, which allows investors to get in at an earlier presale price.

MEMECOIN is built on a philosophy of humour, community, and simplicity, making it a staple for investors who value grassroots initiatives. One of Memecoin’s biggest strengths is its community. Active social channels, meme contests, and charity initiatives have created a sense of belonging among holders. But MEMECOIN isn’t just about laughs. Its team has been quietly building features like staking pools and NFT integrations, giving the token real-world use cases that appeal to a broader audience.

Imagine being part of a movement that started as a joke but grew into a legitimate asset class. That’s what MEMECOIN represents, and it’s why it continues to attract both new and seasoned investors. Ponke: Where Community Meets Purpose Ponke might not have the high-profile hype of its peers, but it more than makes up for it with a passionate community and a focus on meaningful impact. This meme coin is all about giving back, with fundraising events and charity drives at its core. If you’re looking for a token that balances fun with purpose, Ponke is the one to watch. What sets Ponke apart is its decentralised governance model. Every holder has a voice, ensuring that the project evolves in a way that reflects its community’s values. This approach has fostered a loyal following that’s willing to stick with the token through thick and thin. Ponke’s roadmap includes plans for NFT collaborations, staking options, and even a marketplace for meme-inspired goods.

37980937,https://thecoinrise.com/expert-discard-uaes-40-billion-bitcoin-stash-claim/,1734904808,Expert Discard UAE’s $40 Billion Bitcoin Stash Claim,"Recent whispers in the crypto world have suggested that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) now holds a staggering $40 billion in Bitcoin (BTC). The crypto community, including prominent crypto commentator Bitcoin Archive, has questioned the legitimacy of these reports. Meanwhile, some sources tout this claim as a sign of the UAE’s growing crypto influence. The $40 Billion Bitcoin Claim: Fact or Fiction? The claim that the UAE holds $40 billion in Bitcoin has raised eyebrows, especially as no credible sources have confirmed this. The Bitcoin Archive has expressed skepticism about the report, questioning the lack of supporting evidence. According to the Bitcoin Archive, a move of this magnitude would have made global headlines, given the UAE’s influence in the crypto space. He revealed that the original report by Bitcoinist lacked trustworthy sources. Upon further investigation, the Bitcoin Archive found no verification of such a purchase. He cast doubt on the authenticity of the $40 billion figure. UAE’s Crypto-Friendly Environment In recent years, the UAE has established itself as a global leader in the crypto space. Through strategic initiatives like the crypto center in Dubai, the country has created a thriving ecosystem for blockchain startups. These initiatives have made t he UAE a prime destination for crypto entrepreneurs and investors worldwide. The government’s forward-thinking approach to digital assets has helped attract billions of dollars in crypto investments, including a significant portion in Bitcoin. If accurate, the surge in Bitcoin holdings is aligned with the broader global bull market, which has seen many nations increase their crypto reserves. UAE’s Expanding Crypto Market While the $40 billion Bitcoin claim remains unproven, the UAE’s growing involvement in the crypto space is undeniable . Between 2023 and mid-2024, the country saw a massive influx of $34 billion into the crypto market. This marked a 42% increase from the previous year. This surge highlights the country’s growing role in the global crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin remains a major player in the UAE’s crypto landscape, holding 19% of the market share. However, stablecoins like Tether’s USDT dominate 51% of the market. Tether has plans to launch a dirham-backed token . This further shows the UAE’s commitment to digital assets and its vision of becoming a central hub for crypto innovation. By 2025, the number of crypto users in the UAE will reach 3.78 million. Additionally, a recent report revealed that 72% of UAE residents had already invested in Bitcoin by early 2024. Institutional investors and big funds play a significant role in this growth. These statistics show that the UAE is rapidly becoming a leader in crypto adoption.

Hines, a former college football player and 2022 Republican candidate for North Carolina’s 13th congressional district, steps into the role with the support he received from pro-crypto political action committees (PACs) during his campaign for Congress. While his political candidacy was unsuccessful, his new role signals Trump’s intent to advance crypto-related innovation and regulation. “In his new role, Bo will work with David Sacks to drive innovation and growth in the digital asset space while ensuring industry leaders have the resources they need to succeed,” Trump said. “Together, they will create an environment where this industry can thrive and continue to be a cornerstone of our Nation’s technological advancement.” Related News: Alleged Satoshi Nakamoto Candidate Responds to Claims that Quantum Computers Will Crack Bitcoin's Password! David Sacks, who Trump previously appointed to oversee crypto and artificial intelligence (AI) issues at the White House, will work with Hines in shaping the administration's vision for digital assets. Trump’s focus on digital assets comes amid a broad range of economic appointments. Earlier today, he appointed former Treasury Department official Stephen Miran as chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers. Miran, who has drawn attention for his stance on financial regulation, recently voiced his concerns on The Bitcoin Layer podcast, saying: “I think financial regulation is overly burdensome and prevents banks from lending as much as they want to into the economy. And I think sometimes that can really stifle innovation in areas like [the crypto economy].” *This is not investment advice.

37980384,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375050,1734904540,ISIS Crypto Fundraiser Mohammed Chhipa Faces 20 Years After Conviction in Virginia,"Mohammed Azharuddin Chhipa, 35, from Springfield, Virginia, was convicted on December 13, 2024, for providing material support to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United Nations and others. The charges stemmed from his actions between October 2019 and October 2022, during which he raised funds to assist female ISIS members in Syria. Guilty of Financing ISIS Operations In an official press release, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) revealed that Chhipa’s efforts included financing the escape of women from prison camps and supporting ISIS fighters. He also collected funds through various online social media accounts, receiving electronic transfers, and physically gathering money by traveling long distances. The authorities revealed that Chhipa then converted the money into cryptocurrency, which was sent to Turkey and smuggled into Syria for use by ISIS. Chhipa’s primary accomplice was a British-born ISIS member in Syria who played a key role in the fund-raising efforts, including for terrorist activities. Over the course of the scheme, Chhipa sent over $185,000 in cryptocurrency to support ISIS operations. The jury convicted him on one charge of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist group and four counts of providing such support. Chhipa now faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each count. A sentencing hearing is set for May 5, 2025, where a federal district court judge will determine the sentence based on US Sentencing Guidelines and other legal considerations. Crypto’s Role in Terrorist Fundraising Many experts have flagged that ISIS has been using crypto for fundraising. TRM Labs’ report from last August revealed that pro-ISIS networks in countries such as Tajikistan, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Afghanistan have raised significant funds using crypto assets like Tether (USDT) on the Tron network. One such campaign, which operated for over a year, raised nearly $2 million in USDT for ISIS affiliates in Afghanistan. TRM Labs also traced over $517,000 in 2022 sent from an Indonesia-based platform to pro-ISIS accounts. However, it is also important to note that industry experts such as Chainalysis have previously clarified misconceptions regarding the use of cryptocurrency in terrorism financing. While entities like Hamas and Hezbollah use crypto for fundraising, these transactions represent a minor fraction of illicit crypto activities. Chainalysis stresses that terrorism financing remains a small part of overall illicit crypto transactions, with traditional methods such as financial institutions and shell companies being the primary sources of funding. The firm also pointed out that blockchain transparency makes it difficult for terrorists to hide transactions, as seen when Hamas ceased accepting Bitcoin donations.

This Viral New Meme Coin Presale Is the Next Big Move,"The world of meme coins has been a wild ride, hasn’t it? From Dogecoin’s humble beginnings to Shiba Inu’s meteoric rise, these quirky tokens have captured the imagination of millions. What started as internet humour has grown into a massive financial movement, proving the power of community and creativity. A new contender has entered the scene, poised to shake things up: BTFD Coin . With its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, referral program, and juicy staking rewards offering up to 90% APY, BTFD is rewriting the meme coin playbook. Meme coins aren’t just about the laughs anymore—they’re serious business. Over the years, these coins have evolved from mere jokes into powerful tools for community-driven wealth creation. Think about it: Dogecoin paved the way, Shiba Inu raised the stakes, and BTFD is pushing the envelope even further. With over $4.3 million raised in its presale and features that make it more than just another meme coin, BTFD is making waves. Its P2E game went live in beta during Stage 10, giving the community a sneak peek into what’s coming. Meanwhile, the staking and referral programs ensure that holding $BTFD is as rewarding as it is exciting. If you’re still sitting on the sidelines, wondering if this viral new meme coin presale is worth your time, let’s dive in and see how BTFD stacks up against Neiro, another standout in the meme coin universe. BTFD Coin: Turning Chaos Into Opportunity BTFD Coin isn’t just another name in the meme coin lineup; it’s a movement. With a rallying cry of “ buy the dip ’,” this coin invites investors to turn market downturns into wealth-building opportunities. Remember the economic crash of 1973? Inflation was through the roof, stocks tanked, and the financial world seemed freefall. However, smart investors like Warren Buffett saw the chaos as a chance to scoop up undervalued assets, and they came out on top. BTFD channels that same energy, encouraging its community to seize the moment and build their fortunes. The BTFD presale has been nothing short of phenomenal. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, it’s now in Stage 12, priced at $0.00013. Early investors have already seen impressive returns, but the real excitement lies ahead. Analysts predict $BTFD will hit $0.0006 upon listing, a staggering 837.5% ROI for those who got in at the Stage 7 price of $0.000064. Let’s break it down: if you had invested $25,000 at the Stage 7 price, you’d have secured 390,625,000 $BTFD coins. When the coin reaches $0.0006, your investment will balloon to $234,375. Not bad for riding the dip, right? BTFD’s P2E game, which launched its beta version in Stage 10, has already captured the community’s imagination. While rewards aren’t live yet, the gameplay hints at an engaging ecosystem that keeps users returning. Add in a referral program that lets you earn extra tokens by bringing in friends, plus staking rewards of up to 90% APY , and you’ve got a meme coin that delivers on every front. The Bulls Squad, a dedicated community of BTFD supporters, adds excitement, driving engagement and ensuring this coin’s momentum doesn’t slow down. Neiro: The Meme Coin With a Legacy Neiro has been making waves as one of the most talked-about meme coins of the year. Born out of the iconic Doge meme, it’s backed by the Own the Doge DAO, which acquired official IP rights from Atsuko Sato, the original owner of Kabosu (the Doge meme dog). This connection to the meme’s origin story has given Neiro a strong cultural foundation, and its value has skyrocketed. Neiro’s Ethereum-based token boasts a market cap of $663 million, while its Solana-based counterpart is valued at $5 million. These numbers reflect a growing community and solid market interest. However, it’s not all smooth sailing. Neiro faces legal challenges, including a dispute over trademark rights, which has caused some hesitation among potential investors. Still, its innovative approach to blending humour with blockchain technology makes it a compelling option for those looking to diversify their portfolios. Neiro’s community-driven model is its strongest asset. Through voting and active participation, token holders have a say in the coin’s direction. This decentralised approach has helped build a loyal following, making it one of the standout meme coins of the year. While it doesn’t offer the same utility-packed features as BTFD, its cultural significance and established market presence make it a worthy contender in the meme coin space. How to Join the BTFD Presale The process couldn’t be easier if you’re ready to join this viral new meme coin presale.

Conclusion BTFD Coin is the viral new meme coin presale you can’t ignore. Its P2E game, 90% APY staking rewards, and referral program that rewards community growth set a new standard in the meme coin space.

Is it the technological innovation, its market resilience, or the return potential for investors? As blockchain technology evolves, projects like Qubetics ($TICS) , Polkadot ($DOT), and Near Protocol ($NEAR) have emerged as top contenders for delivering transformative value to both their ecosystems and their investors. But among them, which project offers the best coins for massive return potential in 2024? Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Convenience with Multichain Wallet Qubetics has quickly gained traction as a revolutionary blockchain project. Now in the 13th stage of its presale, Qubetics has sold over 367 million $TICS tokens, raising more than $7.5 million from 11,300+ holders. With its current price of $0.0342 per token , analysts predict extraordinary returns of up to 43,711.73% ROI if $TICS reaches $15 post-mainnet launch. An investment of $50,000 at this stage could potentially grow into over $21.8 million. A standout feature of Qubetics is its multichain wallet, a tool that exemplifies its commitment to solving real-world blockchain challenges. This wallet provides users with seamless access to multiple blockchain networks within a single interface, eliminating the complexity of managing assets across fragmented ecosystems. Consider a scenario where a business operates on both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Traditionally, managing these assets would require separate wallets, creating inefficiency and security risks. With Qubetics’ multichain wallet, users can consolidate these operations into one platform, streamlining workflows and enhancing security. With such practical applications and a clear vision for the future, Qubetics positions itself as one of the best coins for massive return potential in 2024. Its unique features and exceptional growth prospects make it an unmissable opportunity for investors looking to capitalise on the blockchain revolution. Polkadot ($DOT): The Interoperability Powerhouse Polkadot is widely recognised as one of the most innovative blockchain projects, designed to address the need for interoperability across networks. Its unique architecture enables multiple blockchains, or “parachains,” to operate seamlessly while sharing security and governance features. This makes Polkadot a cornerstone for decentralised applications and cross-chain communication. Since its launch, Polkadot has established itself as a leader in the blockchain industry. $DOT, its native token, plays a critical role in governance, staking, and bonding for parachains. With an ever-expanding ecosystem, Polkadot has become the go-to choice for developers aiming to create scalable, interoperable applications. For investors, Polkadot represents a blend of stability and growth potential. Its ability to unify disparate blockchain networks positions it as a key player in the future of decentralised technology. Analysts frequently cite $DOT as one of the best coins for massive return potential, thanks to its consistent innovation and adoption. Moreover, Polkadot’s focus on sustainability and scalability makes it attractive to institutions and retail investors alike. Whether you’re looking to diversify your portfolio or invest in a long-term project, Polkadot offers a compelling case with its strong market fundamentals and future-ready technology. Near Protocol ($NEAR): Redefining Developer-Friendly Blockchain Near Protocol has carved out a niche as one of the most developer-friendly blockchains in the industry. Its focus on simplicity and scalability has attracted a growing community of developers, users, and investors. Built on a proof-of-stake mechanism, Near Protocol ensures energy efficiency while delivering high performance. $NEAR, the network’s native token, serves multiple functions, including transaction fees, staking, and governance. Near’s ability to support decentralised applications with user-friendly tools has positioned it as a favourite for developers creating solutions for mainstream adoption. One of Near’s most impressive features is its focus on sharding technology, which allows the network to scale dynamically as demand grows. This ensures low fees and fast transactions, even during periods of high network activity. For investors, Near Protocol offers a balanced risk-reward ratio. Its focus on usability and scalability ensures consistent growth, while its ecosystem expansion provides additional value. With strong fundamentals and a clear roadmap, $NEAR is undoubtedly one of the best coins for massive return potential in 2024. Conclusion: Best Coins for Massive Return Potential Qubetics, Polkadot, and Near Protocol each bring unique strengths to the table, making them standout projects in the crypto market. While Polkadot leads in interoperability and Near Protocol excels in user-centric scalability, Qubetics offers unparalleled innovation with its multichain wallet and extraordinary ROI potential. For investors seeking to maximise returns, Qubetics is a clear choice. Its presale momentum, innovative features, and robust growth projections make it a standout in the blockchain space. With $TICS priced at just $0.0342, the time to act is now. Secure your position in one of the most promising crypto projects today.

While ADA’s current rate represents a 65% dip from its peak, ADA holders are 90% bullish. Compared to Ethereum’s price, ADA is much cheaper, and the developments taking place in its ecosystem could potentially threaten Ethereum’s dominance. Cardano’s Hydra, for instance, can improve Cardano’s scalability, making it a go-to ecosystem for dApp development. Given Ethereum’s struggles to scale its network, including its move from a PoW to a PoS protocol, Cardano’s Hydra can soon help developers build speedy dApps with high rates of mass adoption.

After ADA’s price languished around the $0.35 zone for months, whale activity is now rising in Cardano’s ecosystem, which has seen market watchers anticipate an additional uptick to $2 in the short term. According to reports, an influx of over 680 transactions exceeding $1 million was registered on Cardano’s ADA as confidence in ADA’s bull run grew. Cardano’s founder has also confirmed that ADA is primed for higher highs in 2025, especially with the launch of Cardano’s Hydra. Cardano’s Hydra is set to give developers a unique scaling tool that makes transactions on Cardano cheaper, faster, and more secure. With Ethereum as Cardano’s biggest competition, Cardano Hydra might trigger a migration of developers to Cardano in the near future. Ethereum’s price drops to below $3,400 amid scalability concerns Ethereum ‘s price has remained sluggish in responding to the bull market even though its recent uptick past $4,000. After surging to a striking distance of $5,000 in 2021, Ethereum’s price plummeted to lows of $1,000 but has recovered amid critical resistance at the $4,000 mark. Now, Ethereum’s price has been rejected above the $4,000 mark three times, and market watchers are less optimistic that the leading DeFi ecosystem could surge further to $5,000 – $6,00 during this bull run. Some of the obstacles that have hindered a rally on Ethereum’s price include Ethereum’s bloated network, which has registered skyrocketing network fees at peak congestion. With the advent of scalability solutions such as Cardano’s ADA, Ethereum’s price could experience further sluggish growth. What’s more, mass adoption by institutions will require a lot more liquidity to move Ethereum’s price. Discover the future of cross-border payments with Remittix Ethereum’s potential is fast declining this cycle and investors are looking at alternatives. However, competition from the likes of Cardano’s Hydra is concerning for ETH Holders. However, many ETH holders are switching to a new project leading a new ‘PayFi’ movement.

Remittix is fast and reliable with a simple design that allows anyone to send crypto to a recipient’s bank account without the recipient ever knowing that the payment started with crypto.

Adam Back is among the names claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto. Quantum computers could theoretically break the cryptographic security that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, prompting concerns that BTC wallets could one day become vulnerable to hacking. Adam Back explained that Bitcoin is already “quantum-ready” thanks to Taproot, a technology implemented in Bitcoin in 2021. Taproot uses “leaf nodes” in its design that can hold placeholders for future advanced cryptographic technologies, including quantum-resistant (post-quantum or PQ) signatures. In simpler terms, Bitcoin’s current system is like a house built with extra empty rooms that can later be equipped with advanced security doors if needed. For now, these rooms are unused but ready for upgrades. Related News: El Salvador Announces New Bitcoin Step Despite IMF Warning Back cautioned that there should be no rush to enable quantum-resistant signature technology: The Threat is Decades Away: Quantum computing powerful enough to break Bitcoin's cryptography is still decades away from becoming a reality. Future Innovations: Cryptographic research is constantly advancing. When quantum computers become a real threat, more compact, efficient, and well-studied solutions for quantum-resistant signatures will likely become available. Bitcoin users can prepare for this without immediately enabling quantum-resistant cryptography. This includes: Future-proofing Wallets: Wallets can use new cryptographic formats compatible with future technologies while continuing to use the existing signature system (Schnorr signatures). Seamless Transition: If quantum computing becomes a real threat, Bitcoin can migrate to these quantum-resistant systems without major disruptions. These preparations should ease fears about quantum computing, Back says. In the possible scenario where quantum computing advances faster than expected, Bitcoin has a system in place to adapt. But that likely won’t happen for several decades, allowing researchers to develop and improve compact, efficient solutions in the meantime. *This is not investment advice.

As investors navigate this challenging landscape, it’s essential to examine the factors contributing to these declines and to identify any potential opportunities amidst the chaos. Biggest Losers in the Last 7 Days The biggest losers among altcoins over the past week were: • $WIF: With a loss of 34%, it thus becomes a prime example of why we should always be careful with altcoins in general.• $OP: Down by 32%, its continued decline — is the optimistically-themed Optimism in name only now? • $PEPE: Down 28% for the week, the meme coin that has been taking us all by storm — Pepe ($PEPE) — seems to have suffered a time-out together with all those other manias. • $RENDER: The render token Render ($RENDER) saw its value go down by 25%. This is another example of how even utility-driven coins can face setbacks. • $SOL: After rising to great heights, Solana ($SOL) is now 20% less than it was a week ago. Even the top-tier altcoins are struggling. These declines highlight the many problems that exist in the altcoin market — some contribute to it, others reflect wider economic trends. Half a dominion others believe the downturn began in part due to an exodus from stocks on profit-taking hopes. Will Altcoin Season Even Happen? Historically, Q4 — and December in particular — has always been a bountiful harvest time for those in cryptocurrency markets. But this year defies all the rules: altcoin markets seem to have lost momentum as they struggle for a footing. Therefore, when a seasonal rally fails to appear, worries quickly arise. People who have long awaited such time are now anxious to know, indeed wonder if ever there will be an altcoin season. However, there is cause for hope. Coins like Altura ($ALU) Project all carry the prospectus of a renaissance in Q1 of 2025 or thereafter. By using remarkable technology and carving out a unique place in the market, these coins may lead an about-face to current trends and open up opportunity for next-stage growth. They may yet be a beacon of optimism. Altura ($ALU): A Beacon of Stability Amidst the turbulence, Altura ($ALU) has emerged as one of the most stable and promising AI-integrated cryptocurrencies. Unlike many of its counterparts, Altura has managed to maintain relative stability, drawing the attention of savvy investors. What Makes Altura Stand Out? 1. Machine Learning: The Altura ecosystem makes extensive use of artificial intelligence, especially for its smart NFTs. Altura has already given use cases to their AI-infused NFTs that update based on user interaction and real-world data.2. Humongous Market Cap Potential: As a relatively small market cap that pales in comparison to the other AI and NFT-themed projects we cover, it is a great source of potential. This makes it a prime candidate for upside potential.3. Community and Developer Support: Altura's active developer community and loyal user base have enabled it to withstand market fluctuations, demonstrating its resilience. Bullish Outlook for Q1 2025 Now, if we take a glance at the future, Scripts are super optimistic over Altura ($ALU) for Q1 2025. If you take into account the fact that Altura's market cap is now under $100 million, this is a unique opportunity for a dramatic increase. If it matches its lofty vision, then it can realistically reach a 500M+, 1B+ market cap and 10x+ returns for early-stage investors. • Increasing Demand for AI-Powered NFTs: Altura’s novel application of AI to drive smart NFTs places it in position to capitalize on an emerging trend. The paradigm is shifting from static assets to dynamic, AI-driven tools, and Altura is right there at the forefront.• Strategic Partnerships and Ecosystem Expansion: Altura is actively pursuing strategic partnerships that contribute to its utility and promote ecosystem development. These partnerships will lead to more adoption and would further cement it as a leader within the AI and NFT sectors. Market Recovery Potential: As the broader cryptocurrency market recovers, Altura's unique value proposition and relatively low market cap can make it an enticing investment for those seeking high-growth opportunities. Analysts are already predicting that we could see the start of an early-phase bull run for Altura in Q1 of 2025, with increasing interest in AI teleportation in the broader blockchain arena. With innovative technology, community involvement, and scalability, Altura remains a top-tier project within the space. A low entry point with high potential growth makes it one of the hottest opportunities for 2025. Conclusion: Altura ($ALU) – A Stable Choice in Uncertain Times While the altcoin market struggles to regain its footing, Altura ($ALU) stands out as a beacon of stability and potential. Its innovative approach to AI and NFTs, combined with a supportive community and strategic vision, makes it a compelling investment for those looking ahead to Q1 2025 and beyond. Investors seeking opportunities in the crypto market should keep a close eye on Altura, as it continues to defy the broader market trends and position itself for an “insane rise” in the coming months.

Yet, an emerging altcoin boasting an astounding potential return of 7,400% is poised to steal the limelight. Could this under-the-radar cryptocurrency become the next major player, overshadowing XRP’s goals and seizing the market’s attention? You might also like: Cardano, Dogecoin, XRP, and XYZVerse: Bold 2025 bull run price predictions inside Move over XRP: XYZ targets 7,400% gains to steal the spotlight In a crypto market rife with contenders, XYZ stands apart. Its presale has already demonstrated its potential, with the token’s price leaping from $0.0001 at launch to $0.001 in just a few months — a staggering 1,000% surge. Now priced at $0.001333 in its current presale stage, XYZ is set to rise again to $0.002 in the next stage, climbing toward a projected $0.1 at launch. This trajectory marks a remarkable 7,400% potential increase, making XYZ a serious contender for the top spot in this altcoin season. Why XYZ could overshadow XRP More than just another token, XYZ embodies the spirit of sportsmanship and competition. As part of the XYZVerse ecosystem, it combines meme coin hype with the booming demand for sports-themed dApps, prediction markets, and sports betting. Its robust roadmap and high utility position it as a long-term player, not a flash-in-the-pan trend. While XRP garners attention with price speculation, XYZ delivers tangible progress: Presale Momentum: With rapid stage progress, XYZ has already shown its ability to attract a loyal following. First-Mover Advantage: As the first all-sports meme coin, it taps into a massive, underserved market. Rock-Solid Foundations: Audited smart contracts, a vetted team, and plans for major CEX/DEX listings ensure a secure and credible investment. XRP’s $5 and $10 targets may turn heads, but XYZ offers something truly extraordinary — a chance to secure exponential returns while riding the wave of an altcoin movement. With its presale stages flying by and the final target of $0.1 in sight, XYZ is a rare opportunity for those who act fast. Don’t wait for XRP’s next move; seize the chance to invest in a token with real growth potential and a unique edge. XYZ is more than a meme coin; it’s a movement set to reshape the altcoin landscape. XRP Over the past six months, XRP has shown significant growth, with its price increasing by over 360%. In the last month, the price surged by approximately 105%, indicating strong upward momentum. However, the past week saw a slight dip of about 3%. Currently trading between $2.03 and $2.73, XRP is approaching its resistance level at $3.02. A break above this could propel it toward the next resistance at $3.73, representing a significant gain. On the downside, support levels at $1.61 and $0.9041 provide a safety net against declines. Technical indicators present mixed signals. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.28, just below the 100-day SMA of $2.44, suggesting short-term bearishness. The Relative Strength Index is around 43, indicating the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0252, hinting at potential consolidation. Overall, XRP’s robust performance suggests potential for further growth, especially if it can surpass key resistance levels. Conclusion While XRP’s ambitious goals are impressive, XYZVerse’s 20,000% growth potential and unique sports-meme blend might steal the spotlight in the 2024 bull run.

37978828,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666249,1734901222,Bitcoin $178K Target In Sight? Analyst Highlights Bollinger Band Retest Mirroring Jan. 2024 Rally,"Bitcoin has been on a correction path since it reached a new all-time high of $108,135 on December 17. Notably, this correction has seen the leading cryptocurrency decline by about 10% up until the time of writing and even breaking below $93,000 very quickly. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Above $10: Historical Data Shows How High DOGE Will Go This Bull Cycle This notable decline has seen Bitcoin retesting the Bollinger Bands, and technical analysis suggests a bounce from here to reach a price target around $178,000. Bitcoin Retests Monthly Upper Bollinger Band Bitcoin’s recent price correction has caught the eye of crypto analyst Tony Severino, who highlighted a critical retest of the monthly upper Bollinger Band. Sharing his insights on social media platform X, Severino emphasized the significance of this technical indicator, which measures market volatility and potential reversal points. According to him, this development mirrors a similar pattern observed in January 2024, which eventually led to a substantial rally after a similar retest. According to the daily candlestick chart shared by Tony Severino, the upper Bollinger Band is currently situated just above $96,000, which is around Bitcoin’s current price. This Bollinger Band retest suggests that Bitcoin might be entering a new phase of upward momentum after the recent corrections. Historical Echoes: January 2024’s 86% Rally Offers A Blueprint Severino’s analysis draws parallels between the current price movement and Bitcoin’s behavior earlier in 2024. He noted that in January 2024, a similar retest of the monthly upper Bollinger Band preceded an 86% rally in Bitcoin’s price. At that time, Bitcoin was trading near $46,000, following a strong price rally that was brought forward from late 2023. However, January saw a brief correction, with Bitcoin’s price dropping to $40,000 to test the upper Bollinger Band. This test acted as a launchpad for not only a continued rally but also pushed Bitcoin to break its then all-time high and surpass $70,000 in March for the first time in its history. If Bitcoin were to replicate this 86% rally at this point, it could soar to approximately $178,000, which Severino noted is aligning with the upper range of his target zone. In another analysis, the analyst predicted that Bitcoin could reach its market top as early as January 20, 2025. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading $96,402, still hovering around the upper Bollinger Band. Interestingly, the leading cryptocurrency is currently down by 2.11% and 5.4% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. This pullback has led to the realization of over $5.72 billion in Bitcoin profits, which has added to the short-term selling pressure. The impact of this correction is evident in Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has fallen sharply from 69 on December 17 to its current reading of 45. Related Reading: Ethereum Investment: Trump Crypto Project Grabs 722 ETH At $2.5 Million However, there are reasons to believe that the selling pressure may be easing. This is because the RSI level of 43 has acted as a significant support zone for Bitcoin since September. If this support holds, it could provide the foundation for Bitcoin’s move towards $178,000.

The billionaire blockchain visionary plans to meet Democratic Senators, including Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman, to probably push a bipartisan agenda for the crypto industry. Charles’s strategy is to bridge the gap between political parties and get lawmakers to stop fighting long enough to see what crypto can actually do. Fetterman recently went viral for his comments on Trump’s 2024 win, calling out Kamala Harris for labeling Trump a fascist. “A lot of Democrats, especially in my state, that I know and I happen to love, people that [voted] for Trump, and they are not fascists,” Fetterman said. “I think people are going to decide who protects and projects their version of the American way of life. And that’s what happened.” Charles sees opportunity in Fetterman Charles wasted no time reacting. “When people ask how we make crypto a bipartisan issue, these are the Democrats we need to talk to next year,” he said . For Charles, Fetterman represents a type of leadership that crypto needs—Democrats willing to challenge party lines and think differently. Crypto has been caught in political crossfire, with the Biden administration and Senator Elizabeth Warren taking a hard stance against the industry. Charles has been vocal about this. He slammed what he called Biden and Warren’s anti-crypto “deal,” claiming it stifles innovation and locks legitimate businesses out of the system. But his plan doesn’t stop with a few meetings. He’s already proposed a “Bill of Rights” for crypto users, focusing on consumer protection, fair taxation, and clear asset classification. In November, he launched “Operation Baseline,” a campaign for identifying inefficiencies in the U.S. crypto market and pushing for legislation to fix them. Charles even floated the idea of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong becoming a “White House Crypto Czar” under a potential Trump administration. Armstrong, he argued, could unify the fragmented industry and offer a strong voice in Washington. The president has since chosen someone else. A polarizing figure with big ideas Charles isn’t your typical suit-and-tie tech founder. Critics call Cardano a “zombie chain,” accusing it of lacking activity compared to Ethereum and Solana. Charles doesn’t flinch. He fires back with the same energy, saying, “People see what they want to see.” His outspoken personality is both his strength and his Achilles’ heel. He likes to drag critics, calling them the “paint chip brigade” and taking aim at journalists and competitors alike. It’s a style that alienates some but resonates with others who admire his no-nonsense approach. Though earlier this year, he ran a Twitter poll asking, “Am I cancer for Cardano?” Over 50,000 people voted, and 51.6% said yes. Instead of sulking, he turned the results into another talking point. While Charles’s critics stay busy, so does he. With a net worth of $1.2 billion, he’s funding projects that sound straight out of a sci-fi novel—glow-in-the-dark plants, research to detect extraterrestrial life, and more. He has met with Argentine President Javier Milei more than once to discuss using blockchain in government systems. He’s also urged U.S. lawmakers to align crypto regulations with global standards, pointing to countries like Switzerland and Singapore as examples. He has more than one friend in Trump’s cabinet. “Crypto isn’t a Republican issue. It’s an American and global issue. Only by bringing everyone together can we get to the next level,” Charles said.

Kiyosaki tells his 2.6 million followers on the social media platform X that the United States has a history of devaluing its currency at the expense of Americans saving their wealth in the dollar. The best-selling author refers to the dollar as “fake money,” highlighting that the government can always print more out of thin air. “I stopped trusting my government in 1965 when I noticed our silver coins were now alloys of cooper. In 1971, President Nixon continued the theft of our wealth via our money, when Tricky Dicky Nixon took the US dollar off the gold standard… If you do not [like] being ‘bent over’ and your wealth stolen via your fake money…. Keep being ignorant, working hard for fake money, and continue listening to financial planners who will tell you what to do with your fake money.” Kiyosaki calls on investors to instead store their wealth in scarce assets like gold, silver and Bitcoin ( BTC ). He notes that investing in these three commodities can save people in the event of a severe financial crisis. “THANK YOU gold, silver and Bitcoin HODLERS… Today the best assets for your money are real gold, silver, and Bitcoin. The world is about to crash financially. Please take care.” Last month, Kiyosaki said he plans to accumulate about 100 BTC regardless of price. He notes that he’s comfortable trading his dollars for “real money” like BTC despite Bitcoin’s rising prices. “Today I own 73 whole Bitcoins. A year from now, I intend to own 100 Bitcoin, regardless of price.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $97,222.

Cardano: A scalable and sustainable blockchain platform Cardano is a blockchain platform built for smart contracts, enabling decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, lets users store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano stands out for its energy-efficient proof-of-stake mechanism, Ouroboros, which is more sustainable than traditional proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Settlement Layer for transactions and the Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design enhances its transaction processing capability, potentially up to a million transactions per second. With its focus on scalability and sustainability, ADA shows strong potential. In the current market cycle, the coin appears attractive due to its innovative technology. Shiba Inu: The Ethereum-based meme coin driving innovation Launched in August 2020 by the pseudonymous developer Ryoshi, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has quickly grown into a standout meme coin on the Ethereum blockchain. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB leverages Ethereum’s ecosystem for enhanced functionality and scalability. With an initial supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half were famously sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the supply, significantly reducing its circulation. Unlike its predecessor Dogecoin, SHIB is building a robust utility-focused ecosystem. Key developments include ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for an NFT platform and governance framework, highlighting its ambition to go beyond meme status. SHIB’s Ethereum integration positions it as a versatile asset with potential applications in decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain-based innovations. Conclusion With the bull run of 2024 underway, DOGEN stands out as a token designed for those seeking luxury and success. While ADA and SHIB show less short-term potential, DOGEN aims for significant growth, following in the footsteps of successful tokens like BONK and Popcat. It builds a community of market leaders and offers real benefits, including exclusive perks for early adopters.

37979212,https://thecoinrise.com/argentina-taps-cardano-for-lithium-tokenization/,1734899416,Argentina Taps Cardano For Lithium Tokenization,"Argentina is gearing up for a major transformation in its lithium industry thanks to the innovative Cardano blockchain. In a bold move, three key players, Atómico 3, Zengate, and Alto Grande, are collaborating to launch the world’s first lithium tokenization project. This initiative is set to revolutionize the sector by early 2025, reshaping how lithium is traded and sourced. Cardano and Tokenization: A New Way to Own Lithium By leveraging the Cardano blockchain, the project will turn lithium property rights into digital tokens. This will allow investors to trade fractional metal shares without needing physical ownership. This innovative solution is poised to make lithium more accessible and boost liquidity. It will also simplify international trade through secure, blockchain-based transactions. Argentina has some of the world’s largest lithium deposits, mainly in Catamarca, Salta, and Jujuy. Lithium is essential for electric vehicle (EV) batteries and renewable energy storage, making it crucial for the global shift to clean energy. Speculatively, the EV market is expected to reach $1.3 trillion soon. Argentina is poised to benefit greatly from the increasing demand for lithium. This growth presents a significant opportunity for the country. A Booming Industry and the Promise of Transparency The sector faces ongoing challenges as the country’s lithium exports are set to surpass $5.5 billion by 2025. This is related to supply chain transparency and accountability. The tokenization project aims to solve this by ensuring that lithium can be traced from its source to its end use. The project will utilize blockchain’s secure ledger to reduce fraud and confirm the authenticity of the lithium. Additionally, it will ensure that all ethical and environmental standards are met. This will increase transparency throughout the process. The project aims to improve collaboration between the Argentine government and mining companies . It is to encourage responsible practices that meet environmental and social standards, as tokenizing resources like lithium could transform the industry. Vision for Economic Growth and Global Impact Pablo Rutigliano, founder of Atómico 3, highlighted that the project promotes not only secure ethical sourcing. It aims to support economic inclusion and job creation in Argentina. By reducing reliance on intermediaries, profits can flow directly to local communities and producers, empowering them to grow. The initiative is also an opportunity to create tech-savvy roles and training programs in the country. This will benefit both the local workforce and the global market in the long run. As more industries explore tokenizing real-world assets like minerals, the market is set to grow rapidly. Boston Consulting Group recently estimated that tokenized assets could represent 1% of the global mutual fund and ETF market by 2030. T his would translate to a $600 billion market value.

37978027,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632046,1734898819,Is Google’s quantum tech Willow a threat to Bitcoin’s security?,"Google just dropped Willow, a quantum chip that redefines what “fast” and “accurate” even mean. This isn’t your typical tech innovation. Willow can perform calculations in under five minutes, which would take the fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years to crack. That’s 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years. Let that sink in. But while tech enthusiasts are celebrating, Bitcoin holders might want to sweat. Willow could, one day, dismantle the cryptographic fortress that keeps Bitcoin secure. Bitcoin runs on cryptographic algorithms—unbreakable puzzles that protect the blockchain. Traditional computers can’t touch them. Quantum computers like Willow? That’s another story. With insane speed and improving error correction, quantum machines could turn Bitcoin’s secure foundation into a playground for hackers. The real question isn’t if—it’s when. Willow’s mechanics and Bitcoin’s shaky defense Regular computers use bits—ones and zeroes—to process information. Quantum computers use qubits, which don’t play by the same rules. Qubits exist in multiple states at once, allowing them to explore countless solutions simultaneously. Imagine a maze: your laptop tries one path at a time. A quantum computer? It takes every single path at once and walks out before your laptop finishes tying its shoes. This is where Willow shines. It doesn’t just operate fast, it’s also reportedly quite precise. Until now, quantum systems were wild, unstable, and prone to errors. Tim Hollebeek, a tech strategist at DigiCert, explains , “Part of the issue with qubits is that they are unstable and produce errors. Willow has significant error correction capabilities, which mitigates some of these issues.” But here’s where it gets scary for Bitcoin. Willow’s combination of speed and accuracy means quantum chips could eventually break the cryptographic algorithms that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rely on. Bitcoin vs. the quantum timeline Google’s people aren’t exactly running victory laps over Bitcoin’s grave. A company spokesperson was clear: “The Willow chip is incapable of breaking modern cryptography.” That might sound reassuring, but here’s the thing, all of Silicon Valley knows quantum computers are coming. The timeline? Five to 15 years, depending on advancements. That’s not comforting if you’re banking on Bitcoin staying untouchable. Park Feierbach, CEO of Radiant Commons, thinks even if Willow could hypothetically speed up the process of breaking crypto, it would still take longer than the age of the universe for it to actually do so. For reference, the universe is 13.7 billion years old. Feierbach sums it up: “There’s almost no reason to deploy Willow on this technology in a way that could make tractable progress. It would simply still take too long.” Here’s what Bitcoin believers can hang on to though: RSA, one of the encryption systems tied to Bitcoin’s security, is still safe—for now. Analysts estimate breaking RSA would require around four million physical qubits. That’s millions, not hundreds like Willow currently has. Crypto prepares quantum-safe solutions But the crypto industry isn’t just sitting back, hoping quantum chips stay in development hell. They’re already working on defenses. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has rolled out quantum-safe algorithms designed to withstand attacks from quantum computers. These algorithms don’t rely on the same cryptographic puzzles that quantum machines excel at cracking. Instead, they’re based on math problems that even the most advanced quantum chips struggle with. Google itself has been part of this effort, testing draft versions of these quantum-safe solutions. “The security community has long been aware of the projected timeline to break asymmetric encryption and has been working on defining standards,” a Google spokesperson said. Taqi Raza, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, believes this will lead to entirely new cryptocurrencies designed to be quantum-resistant. “New quantum cryptos would integrate post-quantum cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to the computational power of quantum computers,” Raza said. That’s good news, but it comes with a caveat. Retrofitting Bitcoin or Ethereum to adopt quantum-safe measures won’t be easy. The crypto industry is caught in a weird paradox. On one hand, quantum computing feels like an apocalyptic scenario for Bitcoin. On the other hand, it could push the entire crypto ecosystem into a new era.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-googles-quantum-tech-willow-a-threat-to-bitcoins-security/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37978027.jpeg
37978084,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52861,1734898550,Best New Meme Coins to Join Today: Investors Eye BTFD Presale’s Insane 50% Discount as Floki Inu and Moo Deng Hold Strong,"Have you ever wondered how some investors turn market chaos into fortune? Imagine getting in on the next big crypto trend before the hype takes off. That’s the essence of buying the dip—a concept that resonates deeply in the crypto world. Meme coins, with their wild price swings and community-driven momentum, are the perfect playground for those willing to bet on the lows. Today, we’re spotlighting three standout projects: BTFD Coin (BTFD) , Floki Inu (FLOKI), and Moo Deng (MOODENG). Each one brings something unique to the table, but only one offers the golden ticket of a presale opportunity. Let’s dive into why BTFD’s presale is a game-changer due to the price rolling back to Stage 7 price in the current stage by allowing users to claim over 50% discount by using the BIG50 bonus code. It offers a unique chance for investors to buy the dip and reap big, while Floki Inu and Moo Deng remain favourites among enthusiasts and are the best meme coins to join today. The Unmissable BTFD Coin Presale BTFD Coin—the crypto embodiment of the rallying cry “Buy The Dip”—has lit up the meme coin scene with its innovative features and killer presale momentum. Over $4.3 million raised, 57 billion coins sold, and a community of over 6,300 strong—this isn’t just another meme token; it’s a movement. The presale is in its 12th stage, but here’s the kicker: prices are rolled back to Stage 7, just $0.000064 per coin. To get the discounted price, mention the “BIG50” code. That’s a jaw-dropping 50.77% discount, giving early birds a chance to pocket an 837.5% ROI when the coin lists at $0.0006. BTFD isn’t just about cheap tokens; it’s about value. With a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards boasting a 90% APY, and a referral programme that hands out 10% bonuses to top-performing sharers, BTFD offers more than hype. The beta version of its P2E game is already live, giving users a taste of what’s to come. Though rewards aren’t active in the beta stage, the excitement is palpable. Imagine racking up coins as you play—an engaging way to earn while being part of a thriving community. The BTFD referral programme adds another layer of excitement. Share your unique code, and you’ll receive 10% of the purchase amount in tokens if you rank among the top 20 referrers by month’s end. And for your referrals? They’ll enjoy an extra 10% $BTFD on purchases over $50. It’s a win-win that bolsters both your wallet and the coin’s ecosystem. How to Buy BTFD Coin: Go to the presale page Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Enter the bonus code “ BIG50” to secure the discounted Stage 7 price. Input your purchase amount and confirm the transaction. An example? A $10,000 investment at $0.000064 per coin nets you 156,250,000 $BTFD. When the listing price hits $0.0006, you’re looking at $93,750—a cool 837.5% gain. Floki Inu: A Viking-Inspired Meme Powerhouse Floki Inu, named after Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu, has cemented its position as one of the most recognisable meme coins. Known for its robust community and innovative marketing campaigns, Floki Inu is more than just a meme—it’s a lifestyle brand in the crypto space. FLOKI boasts an ecosystem that includes a P2E game called Valhalla, an NFT marketplace, and charitable initiatives that have built schools in underprivileged areas. Currently trading at approximately $0.000018, Floki Inu has weathered the meme coin storm with resilience. Its Viking-themed narrative and integration into DeFi make it a favourite for investors looking for a balance of fun and utility. While it doesn’t have the presale hype of BTFD, FLOKI’s established track record and passionate community make it a compelling choice for those who believe in the power of meme-driven value. Moo Deng: The New Kid on the Block Moo Deng (MOODENG) might not have the years of history like Floki Inu, but it’s quickly making waves. This cow-themed meme coin is a quirky addition to the meme coin frenzy, blending humour with utility. MOODENG’s ecosystem includes a yield farming platform and plans for a gamified NFT marketplace, drawing in users who enjoy the lighter side of crypto while benefiting from DeFi features. Trading around $0.000013, Moo Deng’s charm lies in its ability to combine meme culture with serious tech. The project’s roadmap includes collaborations with popular NFT artists and an upcoming staking programme designed to reward loyal holders. Though it’s still carving out its niche, Moo Deng shows promise as an alternative investment for those intrigued by its playful branding. Lessons from 1973: Why Buying the Dip Works The 1973–1974 financial crash—a storm of the Bretton Woods collapse and the OPEC oil embargo—taught a valuable lesson: chaos breeds opportunity. Inflation soared, stocks plummeted nearly 50%, and many portfolios bled value. However, savvy investors like Warren Buffett turned the tide by buying undervalued assets. They saw beyond the panic, recognising that market cycles inevitably rebound. This philosophy underpins the BTFD mindset. Buying the dip allows investors to capitalise on temporary downturns, whether it’s stocks or meme coins. Today, with BTFD Coin’s presale offering Stage 7 prices, the opportunity is knocking—loudly. Conclusion Based on its presale performance, unique features, and strong community, BTFD Coin stands as the top pick among the best new meme coins to join today. The opportunity to invest at a 50% discount during its rollback phase is a golden ticket for early adopters. Floki Inu offers stability and a proven track record, while Moo Deng adds a touch of fun to the mix. But for those looking to maximise returns, BTFD’s presale pricing, staking rewards, and P2E ecosystem make it an irresistible choice. Don’t wait—join the next meme coin bull run with BTFD Coin and turn today’s dip into tomorrow’s fortune.

BTFD is Rocking Discounts You Do Not Want To Miss,"Meme coins have taken the crypto world by storm over the past few years. Remember the frenzy around Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? Those digital currencies transformed from jokes into serious investment opportunities, leaving many early investors swimming in profits. As the landscape evolves, a new contender is stepping onto the scene: BTFD Coin (BTFD) . With its ongoing viral meme coin presale today, BTFD is not just another flash in the pan; it’s here to revolutionize the meme coin space with its engaging Play-to-Earn game, an enticing referral program, and a whopping 90% APY on staking. BTFD Coin is currently making waves—its presale has already raised over $4.3 million, with more than 57 billion coins sold to over 6,300 holders. As it moves through the stages of its presale, the price has surged from a mere $0.000004 to $0.000064 at Stage 12, with projections suggesting that it could launch at $0.0006 once the presale wraps up. If you thought you missed out on the Dogwifhat party, think again. BTFD is rocking discounts and opportunities that you absolutely don’t want to miss. But what exactly sets BTFD Coin apart from other meme coins, especially the likes of Dogwifhat? Well, let’s break it down and see why it’s shaping up to be the next big thing in the crypto universe. Dogwifhat: The Meme Coin That Made Waves Dogwifhat burst onto the scene as a playful nod to the meme coin craze, quickly garnering a dedicated following. It’s easy to see why—Dogwifhat taps into a fun and quirky culture that resonates with many crypto enthusiasts. This coin rode the coattails of Dogecoin’s success while trying to carve out its niche. However, it’s faced its fair share of challenges along the way. Despite its initial hype, Dogwifhat’s growth has been somewhat inconsistent. Analysts have pointed out that while it has a strong community backing, the project lacks some of the more robust features that newer coins are offering. The game-changing aspects like staking rewards, referral programs, or even a Play-to-Earn model are missing, making it difficult for Dogwifhat to keep pace with its competitors. Investors looking for serious returns may find themselves disappointed in the long run. With the ongoing volatility in the meme coin market, there’s always the risk of a downturn. Dogwifhat’s price action has been erratic, and while it has its loyal fans, the lack of innovative features means it might not be the best bet for those wanting to maximize their gains. That’s where BTFD Coin comes into play—offering not just a meme coin, but a full-fledged ecosystem designed for engagement and rewards. With the ongoing viral meme coin presale today, BTFD is offering what Dogwifhat just can’t match. BTFD Coin: The Next Big Thing in Meme Coins So, what makes BTFD Coin a standout player in the meme coin arena? Let’s dive into its unique offerings that are turning heads and pumping enthusiasm into the community. First up, we have the Play-to-Earn Game . The beta version of this game went live during Stage 10 of the presale, and while no rewards are earned during this beta phase, the excitement is palpable. Gamers and investors alike are buzzing about the potential for real-world rewards once the game fully launches. Imagine earning while you play—sounds like a win-win, right? Next, let’s talk about the 90% APY on Staking. Staking went live on December 2, and it’s turning heads with its jaw-dropping returns. Investors can lock up their coins and watch their earnings grow—nearly double their initial investment! This feature is particularly appealing for those who prefer a more hands-off approach to crypto. The Referral Program is another highlight. By bringing friends into the fold, you can earn additional BTFD coins. It’s like a treasure hunt where everyone stands to gain. This community-driven approach has already attracted a growing number of holders, making the BTFD family even more robust. Lastly, the Bulls Squad is a dedicated group of supporters and gamers passionate about driving the project forward. This community aspect adds another layer of engagement that many meme coins lack, creating a vibrant atmosphere where everyone feels like they’re part of something bigger. But the real kicker? Analysts are predicting that BTFD Coin could see its price skyrocket after the presale ends. With the current price at $0.000064 and projections for it to hit $0.0006, early investors could be looking at significant returns. If you missed the Dogwifhat party, now’s your chance to jump on this moving train! How to Buy BTFD Coin Ready to grab some BTFD coins? It’s super easy! Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you out: Go to the Presale Page: Head over to the BTFD Coin presale page .

Now, let’s break down the numbers to see just how much you could stand to gain by getting in on BTFD Coin at Stage 12 pricing. Imagine investing $25,000 at the current price of $0.00013 per BTFD Coin. You’d snag a whopping 192,307,692 coins. That’s a hefty stack! If BTFD Coin’s price rises to $0.0006—something analysts are optimistic about after the presale concludes—your investment could balloon to an incredible $115,384.62! We’re talking about a potential profit of over $90,000. That’s some serious cash! But let’s not stop there. Let’s say you decided to invest $4,000 at Stage 7 when the price was $0.000064 per coin. You’d walk away with 62,500,000 coins. If the price hits that sweet $0.0006 mark, your investment would shoot up to $37,500—a staggering 837.5% return! That’s a jaw-dropping $33,500 profit on your original investment. As BTFD Coin’s community and ecosystem grow, there’s a real chance that the price could even exceed $0.0006, giving you even more opportunities to cash in. The ongoing viral meme coin presale today is not just a chance to invest; it’s an opportunity to be part of something bigger. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on BTFD Coin!

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-fires-powell-trumppow-solana-memecoin-will-surge-15000-before-exchange-listing-as-wif-shib-and-pepe-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

His chart also revealed that Dogecoin crypto had two bottoms in the 2022 and 2023 bear markets and formed a descending channel before breaking out. Analyst Tardigrade is convinced that the memecoin is doing this with its current price movement. He forecasts the Dogecoin price could rise as high as $30.

You might also like: Cardano, Dogecoin, XRP, and XYZVerse: Bold 2025 bull run price predictions inside XYZVerse: The next Dogecoin? Signs of a 2021-style surge emerge As the crypto market buzzes with anticipation, XYZVerse is drawing comparisons to Dogecoin’s legendary 2021 rise. Currently priced at $0.001333, XYZVerse has caught the eye of a seasoned Dogecoin investor who believes history could be about to repeat itself. With key similarities fueling the speculation, could XYZVerse be the next major breakout in the meme coin world? Parallels that can’t be ignored In 2021, Dogecoin’s meteoric rise from mere fractions of a cent to all-time highs captivated the world, driven by a mix of meme culture, community spirit, and timing. Now, XYZVerse mirrors some of these elements: Community-Driven Appeal: XYZVerse combines the energy of sports fans with the viral potential of meme coins, cultivating a loyal and engaged community. Massive Growth Potential: Starting at $0.0001, $XYZ is already in its eighth presale stage, with a price of $0.001333 and a trajectory targeting $0.1 — marking a potential 7,402% increase. Cultural Momentum: Just as Dogecoin rode a wave of internet culture, XYZVerse leverages the booming sports and gaming markets, integrating prediction markets and sports betting dApps into its ecosystem. Why XYZVerse could outshine DOGE While Dogecoin’s rise was largely driven by hype, XYZVerse is building on substance. Its robust roadmap includes listings on major centralized and decentralized exchanges (CEX and DEX), audited smart contracts, and a fully vetted team, ensuring both growth and security for investors. Unlike Dogecoin, which lacked utility in its early days, XYZVerse provides real-world applications through its XYZVerse ecosystem, combining entertainment and earning opportunities for millions of sports and crypto enthusiasts. The Numbers Speak Loudly Current Price: $0.001333 Next Presale Stage: $0.002 (+33% jump) Final Price Target: $0.1 Potential Gain: 7,402% increase For those who see the parallels with Dogecoin and are looking for the next big opportunity, XYZVerse offers an entry point at a price that echoes DOGE’s early days, but with added utility and a clear growth plan. Dogecoin Dogecoin began in 2013 as a playful twist on the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the lovable Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no cap on the total number. What started as a joke quickly gained a following, showcasing the power of community and social media in driving interest. In 2021, Dogecoin captured global attention as its value skyrocketed. Fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from personalities like Elon Musk, it surged into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, exceeding $50 billion. Technologically, Dogecoin offers faster transaction times and lower fees compared to some of its peers, making it appealing for everyday use. As the crypto market evolves, Dogecoin remains notable for its strong community support and widespread recognition. While its abundant supply contrasts with the scarcity of coins like Bitcoin, its accessibility and enthusiastic following keep it in the conversation amid current market trends. Conclusion XYZVerse’s fusion of sports and meme culture, ambitious growth goals, and community-driven approach position it for significant success, potentially surpassing coins like DOGE in the current bull run.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Haliey Welch – known as the “Hawk Tuah” girl after a clip of her went viral earlier this year – says she’s fully committed to resolving the issue. “I take this situation extremely seriously and want to address my fans, the investors who have been affected, and the broader community. I am fully cooperating with and am committed to assisting the legal team representing the individuals impacted, as well as to help uncover the truth, hold the responsible parties accountable, and resolve this matter.” Welch recently launched HAWK, a Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin that lost 95% of its value just a few hours after its launch, leading to accusations of her conducting a rug pull scam. A rug pull scam is when the creators of a new token intentionally inflate its price and then sell the large amounts they are holding, causing the asset to plummet and leaving investors holding the bag. Earlier this week, New York-based Burwick Law said it filed a federal lawsuit against Welch on behalf of HAWK investors. “This case involves claims related to investor protections under federal law and the HAWK TUAH memecoin HAWK launched on December 4, 2024.” HAWK is trading for $0.00003409 at time of writing, a 2.1% decrease on the day. At its peak, it was valued at $0.00008917.

He is accused of omitting millions in crypto profits and transferring assets to bank accounts. Hidden Crypto Profits A local news outlet, Donga, prosecutors have requested a six-month prison sentence for Kim, claiming he concealed 9.9 billion won, worth approximately $6.8 million, in crypto assets. The accusations include deliberate omissions of key financial details, such as crypto profits of 1.2 billion won in 2021 and 990 million won in 2022, valued at $835,000 and $689,000, respectively. To cover up these discrepancies, Kim is accused of transferring some of his crypto holdings into regular bank accounts, making it appear as though he had converted his digital assets into fiat currency. His case shed light on the ongoing debate around South Korea’s crypto regulations, especially as the country moves toward implementing a long-debated crypto tax. This tax, set to take effect in January 2025, was originally scheduled for 2022 but faced delays due to political disagreements. Under the new policy, the tax exemption threshold for crypto gains will increase significantly, reducing the number of affected investors. Kim’s case is particularly notable given his vocal criticism of his party’s stance on crypto taxation, further complicating the issue. The case comes amid other high-profile crypto-related legal actions in South Korea, including the recent sentencing of a former bank employee who embezzled millions for failed crypto investments. Kim’s trial is expected to set a key precedent for future legal actions and crypto taxation policies in the country. Meanwhile, South Korea’s financial watchdog, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), has taken a restrictive stance toward crypto-related investments, blocking ETFs focused on companies like Coinbase. This move is part of the wider regulatory environment in the country, which continues to struggle amidst rising political unrest. South Korea’s Crypto Trading Volume Skyrockets It is important to note that South Korea is home to one of the largest crypto markets in the world, and trading has become immensely popular in the country in recent years. In fact, its crypto market saw a historic surge in trading volumes on December 3, when it reached $34.6 billion amid the announcement of martial law. XRP was the standout asset, driving $28 billion in trades on Upbit. Bitcoin faced a brief 30% drop during a “flash crash” but quickly recovered. The record trading volume coincided with the government’s declaration of martial law.

According to Bitcoin Magazine, the president’s senior Bitcoin advisor, Max Keiser, has revealed plans to acquire an additional 20,000 BTC as a medium-term goal. Today, the country added 11 BTC worth approximately $1.06 million, bringing its total holdings to 5,994 BTC worth over $580 million. El Salvador is advancing its BTC acquisition strategy while adhering to conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Under the agreement, private sector BTC use is voluntary and taxes can only be paid in US dollars. For the public sector, Bitcoin-related economic activities and purchases will be restricted, but specific details about these restrictions have not been disclosed.

Bitstamp, a cryptocurrency exchange, excites investors with its promising future. The XRP Army, a dedicated group of aficionados, is feeling hopeful after Bitstamp declared that the altcoin will “make history” next year. Related Reading: XRP Holds Key Demand Level – Whale Activity Suggests Strength A Year Of Development And Transformation For XRP, 2024 has been a great year. The digital asset has gained more than 250% since the March 2020 low of $0.1151 up to a current high of $2.30. The impressive gain comes after significant events that have made the climate for cryptocurrencies improve, like Donald Trump’s election victory and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation. $XRP gonna make history next year — Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) December 20, 2024 Amid challenges such as ongoing legal disputes with the SEC, XRP was able to avoid a prolonged consolidation trend that had been in place for over three years. Analysts are optimistic about the prospects of XRP by 2025. There are projections that it will be at a historic high of $3.55 in the first quarter of 2025. Other projections see prices going as high as $5 to $20. However, these projections are coupled with a sense of warning because there’s always market volatility in the picture. Key Drivers Influencing XRP’s Outlook Several elements are seen coming into play in the trajectory of XRP’s performance next year. The expected approval of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), which could so increase investor confidence, could be one main stimulus. Moreover, the resolution of Ripple’s legal headaches with the SEC should give the market some stability and clear direction. Although optimism exists, other analysts caution that not all investors will benefit from the expected price increase of XRP. An analyst said that a big number of holders might be disappointed if their expectations don’t materialize.

Miran, known for his sharp opinions on Bitcoin and monetary policy, now steps into a position that will shape Trump’s ambitious second-term economic strategy. Trump announced the nomination on Truth Social, saying, “Steve will work with the rest of my economic team to deliver a great economic boom that lifts up all Americans.” Miran, responding on X, said : “I am beyond honored that President Trump has chosen me to lead his Council of Economic Advisers. I look forward to working to help implement the President’s policy agenda to create a booming, noninflationary economy that brings prosperity to all Americans!” Economic plans loaded with controversy As head of the Council, Miran will be Trump’s go-to figure for economic policy decisions, a critical role given the president’s plans to tackle inflation, renew tax cuts, and launch a wave of protectionist tariffs. Trump claims these will restore manufacturing jobs and boost household incomes, a promise he doubled down on during his campaign. Economic concerns like inflation and stagnant wages helped Trump secure his second term and a Republican majority in Congress. But economists have flagged potential risks in his agenda. Some believe deporting undocumented immigrants and imposing tariffs could drive up consumer prices and inflate the national debt. Trump, unfazed, has brushed off these warnings, maintaining his focus on economic growth and price stability. Bitcoin and Miran: A love-hate relationship? While he’s not a die-hard Bitcoin maximalist, Miran’s public commentary on the asset has been enough to grab the community’s attention. Cryptopolitan ran a quick search of the word “bitcoin” on his Twitter and the results show a nuanced—if a bit skeptical—take on the role of crypto in the economy. In March 2023, Miran replied to Cathie Wood’s suggestion that Bitcoin could act as a “flight to safety” during Federal Reserve rate hikes. “Wait, is she saying Bitcoin moving higher is a reason for the Fed NOT to hike rates?” he asked , hinting at skepticism over Bitcoin’s supposed safe-haven status. His more pointed critique came earlier this year when he called out crypto’s contribution to inflation. Miran claimed “I profoundly believe the income/wealth effects on labor force supply due to the crypto/memestock phenomena were nontrivial drivers of inflation. If the Fed cuts into this nonsense, they’ll re-emerge.” His acknowledgment of crypto’s macroeconomic impact, while not overly enthusiastic, shows he’s at least been paying attention. But Miran has also admitted gaps in his crypto expertise. In a discussion about Bitcoin’s $1 trillion growth from late 2023 to early 2024, he agreed it likely added to inflation but hesitated to quantify its overall impact. He also pointed out that a huge amount of Bitcoin is lost or inaccessible—“sunk on the ocean floor or stuffed in a mattress,” as he put it.

It’s a rollercoaster that leaves many investors frustrated. You throw $100 into a so-called “moonshot” coin, dreaming of millionaire status, but instead, you wake up as just another bag-holder. So, how do you avoid burning your cash? Smart decisions, folks. Here’s a rundown of meme coin flops that failed to deliver and one underdog that’s stealing the spotlight. 🐧 Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): Sliding on Thin Ice Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), tied to the Pudgy Penguins NFT ecosystem, made a splash on launch but quickly sank. A jaw-dropping 51% drop in just 24 hours slashed its market cap from $4 million to $2 million. 😾 Popcat (POPCAT): Clawing Its Way Down Inspired by the viral “Popcat” meme, Popcat (POPCAT) was all hype, no substance. Within a month, it fell 47%, losing 19% in a week and 8% in a single day, with trading volume shrinking by 11%. 🐕 DOGS Token (DOGS): Barking Up the Wrong Tree Launched on the TON blockchain to leverage Telegram’s massive user base, DOGS Token (DOGS) is struggling to stay afloat. Its price plummeted 33% in 30 days, with a 7% daily drop and declining market cap. 🐾 Simon’s Cat Token ($CAT): Declawed and Declining Despite its nostalgic charm and animal welfare focus, Simon’s Cat Token ($CAT) couldn’t escape the meme coin curse. Over the past month, it dropped 25%, shedding 2.9% in a week and a brutal 27% in 24 hours, with trading volume down 40%. These animals are not cutting it anymore. The meme coin market is turning into a zoo. It’s a tired concept that’s lost its spark. Every new coin looks like a clone of the last, offering nothing fresh or exciting. In this overcrowded jungle of meme coins, one project is standing out by ditching the furry trend altogether. A fresh concept is drawing the spotlight, shining with something beyond the same old gimmicks. XYZVerse +1,233%—And This Champion is Just Warming Up Among a bunch of creepy animals, $XYZ brings something new to the table. It is the first ever all-sports meme coin rewriting the playbook with its relentless drive and competitive spirit, much like the athletes who inspire it. XYZVerse forms an ecosystem designed for champions, bringing together sports fans, gamers, and crypto enthusiasts under one vibrant banner. Currently in presale, $XYZ is already scoring big: Launch Price: $0.0001 Current Price: $0.001333 (+1233%) Final Stage Target: $0.1—an unbelievable 99,900% surge if achieved. XYZVerse is Heating Up, and This is Your Chance to Get in Early Why $XYZ Is Gaining Traction What’s fueling this explosive growth? It’s simple: community, vision, and results. The XYZVersers, a rapidly growing base of supporters, are the lifeblood of the project. Unlike many meme coins that rely on fleeting hype, $XYZ is already delivering tangible progress, thanks to its presale strategy and ambitious roadmap. The project’s foundation is rock-solid. $XYZ is redefining the meme coin market with a concept that blends sports culture with cutting-edge crypto technology. This isn’t another coin trying to cash in on a trend; it’s creating an entirely new playbook. Ambitious Plans Backed by Action $XYZ’s roadmap doesn’t stop at a clever theme. The project is built to deliver long-term value: Major Exchange Listings: Aiming for global visibility and accessibility. Staking and Passive Rewards: Giving holders more reasons to stay engaged. Scalability on Polygon: Fast, efficient, and low-cost transactions. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with sports media outlets and exclusive digital creators to amplify its reach. These are calculated steps to ensure $XYZ has the staying power most meme coins lack. What’s Next for $XYZ? With the presale nearing its final stages, the real action is about to begin. The Token Generation Event (TGE) and public listings are on the horizon, and that’s when $XYZ will step into the global spotlight. More exposure, more liquidity, and a stronger community mean the potential for even greater growth. XYZVerse is building an ecosystem where sports fandom meets crypto culture, creating a space where engagement and rewards go hand in hand. If the presale results are anything to go by, this is only the beginning of what $XYZ can achieve. Choose Your Meme Coin Wisely The meme coin market is often treacherous terrain, filled with flashy promises and underwhelming results. But in the midst of this chaos, XYZVerse is proving to be a rare exception — a champion in the making. With a sports-driven ecosystem, an impressive 1,233% presale surge, and a roadmap built for sustainability, XYZVerse is showing all the signs of a long-term player in the crypto space. For investors tired of empty promises and looking for a meme coin with real value, XYZVerse offers a fresh opportunity.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Pepe Coin’s meteoric rise turned $100 into $40,000 in weeks, and a trending rival is set to follow suit. Table of Contents A trending PEPE’s rival emerges: Rexas Finance Rexas Finance expected return: Repeating PEPE’s wild run The Advantages of RXS over traditional meme coins Conclusion When Ethereum- based Pepe Coin (PEPE) debuted in April 2023, it swept the crypto scene. Following in the footsteps of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, this token quickly attracted interest in the meme coin movement. Pepe’s appeal surged in the weeks following its release, and it reached an incredible market capitalization of around $1 billion. Early investors would find impressive gains as its price jumped from a meager $0.00000001 to a peak of $0.0000043. Pepe’s spectacular ascent meant a scant $100 investment transformed into $40,000 in just a few weeks. Pepe’s incredible movement enthralled crypto enthusiasts by demonstrating meme coin transforming strength. However, a trending rival is expected to repeat this wild run by PEPE. Crypto whales purchased RXS token You might also like: Here is a quick guide on how to buy Rexas Finance A trending PEPE’s rival emerges: Rexas Finance Rexas Finance is fast rising as the next major competitor in the meme coin and real-world asset tokenizing scene in 2024. Pepe concentrated on its meme-driven appeal, but Rexas Finance is forging a different path by mixing meme coin momentum with practical applications. Rexas Finance intends to streamline the development and administration of digital tokens for actual assets. Emphasizing democratization, RXS lets users tokenize intellectual property, commodities, and real estate — among other assets — with just a few clicks. Rexas Finance distinguishes itself with outstanding presale performance, which has already generated around $29.33 million. From its initial release, RXS has undergone a 400% price increase, currently priced at $0.15 at Stage 10 of its presale. Choosing a public presale instead of conventional venture money has allowed the community to participate in this innovative enterprise. Further increasing the token’s visibility and attractiveness to investors is its placement on websites such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Rexas Finance expected return: Repeating PEPE’s wild run Investors and market analysts find striking similarities between Rexas Finance’s present course and Pepe’s meteoric climb in 2023. With its creative approach and strong presale performance, Rexas Finance is generating waves, much like Pepe, which has attracted the attention of retail investors with its meme-driven buzz. With some estimates of a 500x increase in value, experts believe RXS might either copy or even exceed Pepe’s extraordinary success. Should these forecasts come to pass, a $100 investment in RXS might produce an incredible $50,000 in only a few weeks. The Certik audit of Rexas Finance still lends another degree of reliability, increasing investor confidence. The project’s architects have revealed intentions to list the token on three Tier 1 exchanges, an action likely to generate notable trading volume and price momentum following launch. These calculated moves put RXS in a great position to profit from its rising appeal and copy the kind of gains Pepe made to become a household name in cryptocurrencies. You might also like: Here is a quick guide on how to buy Rexas Finance The Advantages of RXS over traditional meme coins Although meme coins like Pepe and Dogecoin mostly rely on hype and community involvement, Rexas Finance provides more significant value by closing the distance between blockchain and actual asset management. This gives RXS a competitive advantage, attracting institutions and ordinary investors. Unlike its forebears, which had no inherent worth, RXS enables users to tokenize assets, generating countless opportunities for ownership and exchange. Moreover, the project’s choice to incorporate the community via a public presale rather than venture capital money shows its dedication to inclusiveness. Early on, Rexas Finance encouraged broad involvement to build a devoted user base that views the token as more than a speculative asset. This grassroots strategy benefits from a real-world application but reflects the community-driven excitement that drove Pepe’s ascent. Conclusion The search for the next Pepe-like success story continues as the crypto industry develops. Rising quickly as the top rival is Rexas Finance, which combines the practical value of actual asset tokenization with the viral attraction of meme currencies. RXS is laying the groundwork for a historic price explosion, with its Certik audit boosting confidence and presale already exceeding expectations. Rexas Finance gives individuals who missed Pepe’s meteoric ascent another chance to profit from a unique prospect.

The Richmond Confidential says Contra Costa County has allocated funds for a guaranteed income pilot program giving up to $1,000 per month to 250 residents for a period of one and a half years. The program, which could kick off by the end of 2025, will target homeless residents, young people transitioning from foster care, low-income households with young kids and newly released convicts. Contra Costa County’s Board of Supervisors allocated funding for the guaranteed income pilot program last month. The funding will be drawn from a countywide sales tax known as Measure X that was approved by voters in the 2020 general election. Revenue generated from a statewide criminal justice reform bill is also another source of the program’s funding. Currently, Contra Costa County officials are fleshing out the program’s details including the selection and application processes of potential participants. The report cites Measure X Community Advisory Board member Rachel Rosekind, who says the pilot program aims to transform lives. “The idea is to really make a transformative investment in our residents. And so to think about all the different ways to do that in terms of how long, how much, who are we investing in. We want to really uplift and change not just the lives of these residents, but the lives of their families, the fabric of their communities.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

For seasoned investors and newcomers alike, finding the best altcoins to invest in this week requires an understanding of the projects reshaping the blockchain landscape. Qubetics, Ethereum, and Polygon are leading this charge, each offering unique opportunities in a dynamic market. While Ethereum solidifies its role as a leading asset with sustained ETF inflows and expectations of reaching a new all-time high, Polygon is executing a transformational upgrade with Polygon 2.0. Meanwhile, Qubetics is making waves with its presale success and advanced blockchain solutions, setting a new standard for scalability and real-world usability. Qubetics: Leading the Blockchain Revolution Qubetics is emerging as one of the most exciting blockchain projects of 2024. Combining innovative features like real-world asset tokenisation and interoperability, Qubetics is addressing some of the industry’s most critical challenges. The Qubetics Presale: A Testament to Trust Currently in its 13th stage, Qubetics’ presale has already raised over $7.5 million, sold more than 367 million $TICS tokens, and attracted over 11,300 token holders. At $0.0342 per token, investors are seizing the chance to get in before the next price hike this weekend. Analysts predict $TICS will rise to $0.25 by the end of the presale, delivering a 630% ROI, with a potential to reach $1 post-presale (2,820% ROI) and $15 after the mainnet launch (43,711% ROI). For example, a $9,000 investment today could yield $65,610 at $0.25, $262,800 at $1, and a staggering $3,945,000 at $15. These numbers highlight why Qubetics is among the best altcoins to invest in this week. Scalability: Solving Blockchain’s Biggest Problem Scalability remains a major issue for many blockchains, leading to network congestion and high transaction fees. Qubetics solves this by introducing a highly scalable infrastructure that ensures seamless operations even during high network traffic. Imagine a global retailer using Qubetics to process thousands of cross-border payments in real time without delays or exorbitant fees. This level of scalability makes Qubetics an ideal platform for businesses seeking efficiency and reliability in blockchain solutions. Ethereum: The Institutional Favourite Ethereum has always been at the heart of blockchain innovation, from decentralised finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum is often viewed as a more versatile alternative to Bitcoin. Recent trends show sustained inflows into Ethereum ETFs, a clear indication of growing institutional confidence. Analysts predict Ethereum could surpass its previous all-time high of $4,878, potentially hitting $5,000 next year. This optimism is bolstered by Ethereum’s transition to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake system, making it a more appealing investment for environmentally conscious stakeholders. Additionally, the Ethereum network continues to burn a significant amount of ETH through transaction fees, reducing supply and creating upward pressure on prices. This deflationary mechanism ensures Ethereum’s long-term value as a yield-generating asset. Ethereum’s versatility as a platform for building decentralised applications (dApps) makes it indispensable in the blockchain world. Developers rely on its robust ecosystem to launch innovative projects, from gaming platforms to decentralised exchanges. Its widespread adoption and proven track record cement Ethereum’s place as one of the best altcoins to invest in this week. Polygon: Scaling Ethereum’s Success Polygon has consistently been at the forefront of scaling solutions for Ethereum, offering faster transactions and lower fees without compromising security. As Ethereum’s primary layer-2 solution, Polygon is an integral part of the blockchain ecosystem. The implementation of Polygon 2.0 is underway, marking a significant upgrade to the network. This series of technical enhancements aims to transform Polygon into a network of interconnected zero-knowledge-powered layer-2 chains. These upgrades will drastically improve Ethereum’s scalability, enabling even more use cases and higher transaction throughput. Polygon is also exploring a bold proposal to optimise its $1 billion in stablecoin reserves. If approved, this plan could generate $70 million in annual yield, funding ecosystem growth and innovation. This strategic move showcases Polygon’s commitment to sustainable development and long-term success. From supporting DeFi platforms to enabling NFT marketplaces, Polygon’s role in Ethereum’s ecosystem is indispensable. Why Qubetics Stands Out While Ethereum and Polygon are well-established powerhouses, Qubetics is carving a niche as a next-generation blockchain platform. Its focus on real-world applications, from scalability to asset tokenisation, sets it apart from other projects. One of its standout features, interoperability, ensures seamless interaction between different blockchain networks. For example, a logistics company could use Qubetics to integrate supply chain data across private and public blockchains, streamlining operations and reducing costs. Moreover, the QubeQode IDE simplifies blockchain development, enabling businesses to deploy smart contracts and decentralised applications without technical expertise. This accessibility broadens blockchain adoption, making Qubetics an essential tool for businesses of all sizes. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Blockchain Innovation As 2024 draws to a close, Qubetics, Ethereum, and Polygon are setting the stage for blockchain’s next chapter. Ethereum continues to lead with its institutional appeal and deflationary mechanics, while Polygon revolutionises Ethereum scaling with Polygon 2.0. However, Qubetics stands out as the most promising project of the three. Its presale success, innovative features, and focus on solving real-world challenges make it a compelling investment. The time to act is now. Visit Qubetics’ presale page and secure your $TICS tokens before the price hike. Whether you’re new to crypto or an experienced investor, Qubetics is your gateway to the future of blockchain innovation. Don’t miss out on one of the best altcoins to invest in this week.

37976070,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-hedge-funds-struggle-as-75-face-banking-woes-report/,1734894919,Crypto Hedge Funds Struggle as 75% Face Banking Woes: Report,"A survey has uncovered a worrisome trend among cryptocurrency hedge funds in the last three years. The survey noticed a pattern that has become prevalent, as about 75% of crypto hedge funds had challenges securing banking services. Banking Woes Highlight Discrimination Against Crypto The survey conducted by the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA) and cited by the Wall Street Journal highlights significant issues. Notably, out of 160 crypto-focused hedge funds sampled, about 120 experienced difficulties with their banking services. This represents approximately 75% of the respondents in the survey. The banking difficulties experienced were many and varied. These include vague communications account closures without clear reasons, among others. On the rare occasions when reasons were given, the financial institutions claimed reluctance to get involved in the volatile activities of the crypto market. Meanwhile, a sampling of 20 alternative investors from other sectors like real estate and private credit told a different tale. The report shows that none of such difficulties were experienced, suggesting it was crypto-specific. Crypto Executives Confirms Report In reacting to the development, Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, described it as systemic discrimination. Grewal queried the deliberate exclusion of crypto entities from accessing banking services, stating that organizations in other sectors were not subjected to such treatments. Another top crypto executive and Chief Investment Officer at crypto hedge fund Bitwise , Matt Hougan, considered it notable progress that the issue was openly deliberated upon. Hougan maintained that these discriminatory practices were common knowledge in the crypto community. However, these banks have often denied their actions in public. The Bitwise executive says it was a relief that the conversation had been elevated from the level of gaslighting those denied banking services. Optimism on the Horizon for Crypto Banking Industry experts project a shift on the crypto horizon once President-elect Donald Trump assumes office on January 20, 2025. The optimism stems from appointments and nominations that Trump has made ahead of his inauguration. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will have a pro-crypto Chair, Paul Atkins . Atkins will replace the current Chair, Gary Gensler. Additionally, David Sacks, appointed Artificial Intelligence and Crypto Czar, has hinted at the need to investigate restrictive banking practices in the crypto sector. Meanwhile, a crypto advocacy group, Digital Chambers Token Alliance, has charged the SEC with critically reviewing all ongoing lawsuits and investigations in the sector. The aim is to reset the crypto sector as the Trump administration prepares to take off.

SRP Federal Credit Union, one of the largest in the state with over $1.6 billion in assets as of 2022, filed breach notifications with regulators in Maine and Texas on December 13th, The Record reports . A law enforcement investigation discovered hackers had accessed the bank’s internal systems multiple times between September 5th and November 4th, 2024. SRP says the hackers “potentially acquired certain files from our network during that time.” While SRP hasn’t publicly stated what specific information was stolen from them, The Record reports that the credit union told Texas regulators that Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, dates of birth and financial information like account numbers as well as credit or debit card numbers are compromised. According to cyber security management and threat analysis firm Hackmanac, a well-known ransomware group called Nitrogen took credit for the attack, which claimed to also have customers’ full names and credit ratings. “Nitrogen ransomware group claims to have breached SRP Federal Credit Union. Allegedly, 650 GB of confidential customer data, including full names, SSNs, DOBs, addresses, account numbers, and credit ratings, were exfiltrated.” Source: Hackmanac/X Despite Nitrogen’s claims, SRP has not said whether it was a ransomware attack, and reportedly told regulators that the hack didn’t impact its online banking system or core processing systems. Earlier this year, Nitrogen took credit for six other victims , including five US firms and one Canadian company, according to Hackmanac. Several law firms are now investigating claims from SRP customers in regard to the breach.

37975749,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27815,1734894711,Quantum Computing Will Fortify Bitcoin Signatures: Adam Back,"Bitcoin Security in a Post-Quantum Era Bitcoin’s cryptographic signatures are fundamental to its security, ensuring that transactions are verified and unaltered. These signatures, created using private keys, serve as proof of ownership and safeguard the network from unauthorized changes. However, concerns have been mounting about the potential for quantum computing to disrupt this mechanism by breaking the cryptographic algorithms that underpin Bitcoin’s security. Despite these fears, Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and a prominent cryptographer, believes quantum advancements could ultimately benefit Bitcoin. He argues that post-quantum (PQ) cryptographic research will produce more compact and efficient signature schemes that could be integrated into the Bitcoin protocol. This would not only fortify Bitcoin’s defenses but also demonstrate the network’s ability to adapt to evolving technological landscapes. According to Back, the post-quantum era is still several decades away, allowing ample time for the development and implementation of robust solutions. Concerns Over Quantum Computing Quantum computing has reached significant milestones, such as Google’s recent unveiling of the Willow chip. Capable of solving problems in minutes that would take traditional supercomputers septillions of years, this technology showcases quantum’s potential. However, it has also reignited concerns about the vulnerability of cryptographic systems, including Bitcoin’s. Willow, though groundbreaking, remains far from posing an immediate threat to blockchain encryption. Kevin Rose, a former Google product manager, emphasized that breaking Bitcoin’s cryptographic security would require a quantum computer with around 13 million qubits. In comparison, Willow currently operates with just 105 qubits. While these advancements highlight quantum’s promise, they also underline the long road ahead before the technology becomes capable of challenging established encryption methods. Ethereum’s Proactive Approach to Quantum Threats Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is also preparing for a post-quantum future. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder, has proposed measures to mitigate quantum risks. One suggestion includes implementing a hard fork that would adjust Ethereum’s cryptographic infrastructure, ensuring its resilience against potential quantum attacks. This proactive stance highlights the broader blockchain community’s commitment to evolving alongside technological advancements. As quantum computing progresses, it continues to evoke both excitement and apprehension within the cryptocurrency industry. While potential risks loom, leaders like Adam Back and Vitalik Buterin remain optimistic, focusing on solutions that will ultimately enhance blockchain security and maintain trust in decentralized systems.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION | FORKS,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/quantum-computing-fortify-bitcoin-signatures/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png
37975752,https://crypto.news/?p=14321479,1734894644,"Experts say these 3 altcoins will rally 3,000% soon, and XRP isn’t one of them","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Experts predict three altcoins, including Near Protocol, Render, and Rollblock, will see a 3,000% rally, excluding XRP. Industry experts are buzzing about three altcoins set for substantial growth and are forecasting a 3,000% rally. Near Protocol is gaining popularity for its scalability and developer-friendly design, and Render is redefining decentralized digital rendering with its platform. Meanwhile, Rollblock , a rising star in crypto gambling, is capturing interest with its unique DeFi integration. XRP, however, is notably absent from these projections, making way for these exciting contenders. You might also like: DeFi ecosystem for BTC, says Hoskinson; Rollblock early backers to take advantage Rollblock: Transforming online gambling with web3 technology Rollblock (RBLK) is redefining the traditional casino model for the modern era through its Web3-powered platform. With the online gambling market valued at $450 billion and projected to grow by 8% annually over the next decade Rollblock is perfectly positioned to disrupt this thriving sector. Unlike traditional casinos known for dishonest practices, Rollblock ensures complete transparency. Each transaction is saved on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling players to place bets securely and fairly. The platform offers over 7,000 immersive games, including poker, roulette, slots, and new titles, including Candyland and Cash Compass. Rollblock also launched a sports betting option last month, and this upgrade has received overwhelmingly positive feedback. Trust is at the heart of Rollblock’s mission, reflected in its gaming license from the respected Anjouan Gaming Authority. The casino also offers a revenue-sharing model that rewards holders. Weekly, a percent of the casino’s revenue will be used to buy back tokens, burning 60% and distributing the remaining to holders. The platform’s unique approach has attracted over 32,000 presale registrants, with RBLK tokens now priced at $0.043 in stage 9 of its ICO. Analysts believe this GambleFi gem has the potential for a meteoric rise, predicting a run to $10 by 2025 as Rollblock cements its place among the leaders in crypto gaming. Near Protocol’s BlockDAG sparks optimism amid market downturn Near Protocol has dropped by 10% to $5.02 during the last twenty-four hours as it enters a bearish market pattern. Despite that, its 24-hour trading volume jumped 81%, suggesting that investors are buying the dip. In comparison, XRP also slid by 6% during the same period. Over the last month, Near Protocol lost 11% of its value, decreasing from $5.60 to $5.02. Nonetheless, the protocol is continuing to improve its blockchain scalability features. Near Protocol’s adoption of BlockDAG technology is set to improve efficiency, delivering faster transaction speeds and enhanced security. This innovation positions Near Protocol as a candidate for blockchain leadership. Render Holds strong amid market volatility Render’s value has dropped by nearly 8% over the last 24 hours and is now trading at $6.94. Despite the dip, trading volume surged by 52%, indicating steady investor confidence in Render amidst market volatility. Recently, Render achieved a $5 billion market cap and solidified its position as one of the leading AI coins. Currently ranking third in social dominance among the top five AI cryptocurrencies, Render trails FET and VIRTUAL, both of which have gained traction in recent weeks. However, Render’s robust market presence keeps it a significant player in the AI and blockchain industries. While XRP faces challenges in the broader market downturn, Render’s continued advancements set it apart. Analysts suggest RNDR could hit $15 by Q1 2025, aligning with growing confidence in AI-focused cryptocurrencies, much like XRP’s steady appeal among institutional investors. Rollblock Outshines XRP, Render, and Near Protocol with 3000% Growth Potential While XRP, Render, and Near Protocol face notable declines, Rollblock is gaining momentum as the most promising contender for long-term growth. Unlike its struggling counterparts, RBLK shows impressive resilience and upward potential, making it a standout in the crypto market.

The relative strength index is at 39.03, indicating the coin is approaching oversold territory. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00003614. If SHIB breaks this level, it could rise toward the second resistance at $0.00004418, representing a significant percentage increase. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.00002043, suggesting short-term upward momentum. With altcoin season approaching, SHIB might be ready for a bullish run. Dogwifhat (WIF) Poised for Breakout Amid Altcoin Season Hype Dogwifhat (WIF) is currently trading between $2.38 and $3.52. Despite recent dips of -37.25% this week and -43.69% over the past month, there's still a positive 6-month change of +6.72%. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 35.77, and the stochastic is at 28.58, both suggesting oversold conditions. This could signal an upcoming price rebound. The nearest resistance level is at $4.19, and breaking through could push the price toward the second resistance at $5.33. This move would represent potential gains of over 50% from current levels. With altcoin season on the horizon, WIF might be ready to ride the global crypto bull run. Conclusion With SHIB and WIF showing less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom for all.

RBLK tokens are currently on sale for the bargain price of $0.043 at the time of writing, making now a fantastic opportunity to get involved. Solana finds staggering success as top utility token of 2024 ChatGPT identified Solana’s role in the meme coin market as the key to its staggering success. The Solana price rose over 1,000% from late 2023 as it came to redefine the market for Layer 1 blockchains. While other Layer 1 blockchains were struggling with the perennial problem of external scaling solutions, Solana’s internal solution set it apart. Solana was able to rapidly scale up to challenge the largest Layer 1 blockchain ecosystems by many metrics. Now Solana is poised to become the largest Layer 1 blockchain as it rapidly scales from its current price of $182.13. Dogecoin rally shows importance of community in crypto value The blistering year-end rally in the Dogecoin price was fueled not by utility but by its massive meme coin community. The Dogecoin price rallied over 300% in a matter of weeks as its community made it the top meme coin for celebrating Donald Trump’s election victory. Dogecoin’s meme coin rally demonstrates the importance of community in creating crypto value. Dogecoin continues to have the biggest and most dedicated community with some community members anticipating a price increase to $1 in 2025. ChatGPT sees stellar 2025 growth for Rollblock ChatGPT suggests that Rollblock perfectly captures the value created by both Solana and Dogecoin in 2024.

37975415,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313726,1734894078,"Russia, India and South Africa Say BRICS Not Seeking to Weaken US Dollar: Report","Three BRICS countries are uniting in sending a message to President-elect Donald Trump about the economic bloc’s alleged de-dollarization efforts. Last year, reports surfaced that BRICS is creating a common currency backed by gold and potentially additional precious metals and assets in an effort to circumvent USD. But now, there’s an apparent reversal. Russian diplomat Sergey Ryabkov says BRICS is willing to sit down with Trump to clarify that the group of economically aligned nations has no intention to undermine the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency, reports state-owned agency TASS. “We are ready to explain to Trump, or anyone else, that we are not encroaching on the dollar. We are drawing conclusions from the irresponsible and fundamentally flawed policy that Washington has pursued in this area under successive administrations, not excluding Mr. Trump’s first administration.” Fellow BRICS nation India is also expressing the same sentiment. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar says it would be detrimental for India to join any effort that seeks to erode the dollar’s strength given that the US is its biggest trading partner. “Where the BRICS remarks were concerned, we have said that India has never been for de-dollarization, right now there is no proposal to have a BRICS currency. The BRICS do discuss financial transactions… The US is our largest trade partner, we have no interest in weakening the dollar at all.” And South Africa says reports about the development of a BRICS currency designed to dethrone the US dollar have been misinterpreted. “Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency. This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.” The statements issued by Russia, India and South Africa come after Trump issued an ultimatum against BRICS earlier this month, saying that the US will not sit idly while a group of nations come after the dollar. “The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER. We require a commitment from these countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency, nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US dollar or, they will face 100% tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US economy. They can go find another ‘sucker!’ There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the US dollar in international trade, and any country that tries should wave goodbye to America.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

37977010,https://invezz.com/?p=2399317,1734893950,iDEGEN token in focus as Bitcoin and Pepe prices slip,"Bulls remain in control of the cryptocurrency space even as the fear & greed index eases to a neutral level of 59 as at the time of writing. Analysts forecast an unparalleled bull run in 2025; an aspect that has pushed investors to look for profitable investment opportunities beyond Bitcoin. This explains the craze around altcoins and memecoins. Among the new entrants that have caught investors’ attention is iDEGEN . The social experiment, which is about to be listed on exchanges, leverages the power of AI, social media, and meme coins. Bitcoin’s profit-taking might get deeper The bullish sentiment that has defined the cryptocurrency space in recent months has seen Bitcoin, the leading crypto by means of market cap, rally past the psychological level of $100,000 for the first time ever. In the just-concluded week, BTC/USD extended its gains to a fresh all-time high of $108,577.25. In addition to the crypto’s fourth halving event that occurred earlier in the year, the Fed’s rate cutting cycle and Trump’s win have bolstered Bitcoin price in 2024. With the expected 2025 bull run, some analysts expect BTC to reach $200,000. However, the current profit-taking mood may move deeper in the near term. A look at its daily chart shows the crypto trading below the 20-day EMA while holding steady above the mid-term 50-day EMA. As such, it may face a period of consolidation between $99,943.44 and $91,818.69 as was the case in late November. During this period, the bulls will be keen on defending the crucial support zone at $90,000. Below that level, Bitcoin price may dip further to $80,000 before it gathers enough bullish momentum to reverse the losses. iDEGEN: Beyond the FOMO is the real deal On November 26th, a revolutionary AI agent was introduced on Crypto Twitter. Less than a month later, the auction has raised close to $8 million as at the time of this publication. Additionally, more than $1 billion tokens have been sold as savvy investors strive to own some $IDGN tokens before the highly anticipated listing on 1st January 2025. So what’s driving the iDEGEN craze? Well, the success of this social experiment lies in its uniqueness. To begin with, the project embodies the true spirit of “by the community, for the community”. As seen on its website, iDEGEN’s slogan is “AI Born. Degen Raised”. It operates without any guard rails other than it posts on X after every 60 minutes. By doing so, its AI agent adopts and learns from any tweet, tag, or comment sent its way. The result is an hyper active online community that has embraced its power and role in directing the project as it pleases. It is this engagement that has built an intense FOMO that has a huge wave of investors getting onboard. Notably, its not just about the curiosity; iDEGEN is founded on the principle of “what you order is what you get”. Unlike some presales where the creators enact random token prices, $IDGN’s price changes every 5 minutes depending on its demand. At at the time of writing, the token was priced at $0.0346; down by 80% over the past 7 days. Even so, its returns remain unmatched at 18,626%. If at least one purchase is made within a span of 5 minutes, the token’s price remains the same during the next 5-minute interval. However, purchases in two consecutive intervals yields a price increase of 5% in the next. On the other, the absence of a single buy within 5 minutes causes the price to drop by 5% in the next. Upon its listing on 1st January, $IDGN’s price will be 10% higher than at the close of its auction. This dynamic pricing model lowers the possibility of a huge wave of dumps upon hitting the public shelves in addition to giving its holders the value they asked for. Learn more about the iDEGEN token here . Pepe’s technical indicators point to a probable rebound Pepe’s popularity has seen it surge to become the 24th top cryptocurrency with a market cap exceeding $7 billion. It has grown from being just a trendy coin with its value founded on its integration of ordinary investors rather than just the monied big whales. A look at its daily chart indicates that the altcoin has dropped by close to 40% since it hit its all-time high of $0.0000283 on 9th December 2024. Besides, it is trading below the 20 and 50-day EMAs as a hawkish Fed heightens volatility in the broader crypto market. However, with an RSI of 39, Pepe is likely to rebound in the near term. Besides, since the beginning of the year, it has rallied by over 1200%. At its current price of $0.00001742, it continues to trade above the crucial resistance-turn-support zone of $0.00001656. In the ensuing sessions, investors will be eyeing the technical indicators for further guidance.

Bitcoin (BTC) - The Pioneering Cryptocurrency Transforming Digital Transactions Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency created by Satoshi Nakamoto. It uses blockchain technology to allow decentralized peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries like banks. Transactions are verified by miners who solve complex puzzles and are rewarded with bitcoins. Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins, making it scarce. The network undergoes a halving approximately every 4 years, reducing miners' rewards by half. This design aims to make Bitcoin resistant to fraud and inflation. Its decentralized nature and limited supply give it potential as a store of value. In the current market cycle, Bitcoin's attributes may make it attractive to investors seeking alternatives to traditional currencies. Conclusion Bitcoin's comeback to $105,000 is expected, but other coins have less short-term potential. Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero, offering financial freedom to all. With a 700% ROI in its presale—starting at $0.0002 and rising to $0.0016 over 14 stages—and triple utility of governance, incentives, and staking, it invites participation to fight crypto villains.

TRON (TRX): Empowering Digital Content Creators Through Decentralization TRON (TRX) is a blockchain-based platform developed by the Tron Foundation and launched in 2017. It aims to give full ownership rights to digital content creators, allowing them to receive direct rewards from consumers without intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. TRX tokens, initially based on Ethereum's ERC-20 standard, now operate on their own network supporting smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). The platform uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin, with a public ledger for tracking operations. By enabling the creation and sharing of content without transaction fees, TRON offers a decentralized Internet experience. In the current market cycle, its focus on empowering creators may make TRX an attractive option. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Expanding Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility with Ethereum's ecosystem. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous Ryoshi, SHIB started with 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, raising SHIB's profile. SHIB's Ethereum integration allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, with plans for an NFT platform and DAO-based governance. These developments suggest potential for broader utility. In the current market cycle, SHIB's expanding functionality may make it an attractive option for participants. UNI Token: Uniswap's Governance Coin and Its Market Potential UNI is the governance token of Uniswap, a decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in September 2020, UNI allows holders to vote on changes to the platform, such as fees and token distribution. Uniswap uses an automated liquidity protocol, enabling users to trade without intermediaries while keeping control of their funds. In response to competition, Uniswap distributed 150 million UNI tokens to past users, giving each 400 UNI tokens worth over $1,000 at launch. As one of the largest platforms in decentralized finance with over $3 billion in assets, UNI has significant potential. In the current market cycle, UNI's role in a leading exchange makes it an attractive option. Ethena (ENA): A Synthetic Dollar Protocol on Ethereum Ethena (ENA) is a synthetic dollar protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It offers a crypto-native solution for money that operates independently of traditional banking systems. Ethena introduces the 'Internet Bond', a globally accessible, dollar-denominated savings instrument. This allows users to save and transact in a stable value without relying on conventional banks. By leveraging Ethereum's technology, Ethena aims to enhance financial accessibility and security. In the current market cycle, where there's growing interest in decentralized finance and stable assets, Ethena presents potential for users seeking stability and innovative savings options within the crypto ecosystem. Conclusion TRX, SHIB, UNI, and ENA may offer less short-term potential. Catzilla emerges as a unique meme coin aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone.

37975498,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=632015,1734893117,2024 was a great year for stablecoins. 2025 will be even better,"The stablecoin market went from promising to explosive in 2024. It started the year with a market cap of around $135 billion. By December, that number shot past $200 billion—a more than 50% increase. And since the November elections, it’s grown another 15%. But don’t think for a second this momentum is slowing down. With a pro-crypto administration set to take the reins and Congress inching toward a long-awaited regulatory framework, 2025 is set to be even better for stablecoins. The thing is USDC and USDT are becoming the backbone of the global financial ecosystem. They’re completely changing how people trade, save, and transact anywhere. Experts say the market’s value could double and hit $400 billion next year. Regulations could double the stablecoin market Stablecoins have been waiting for one thing to unlock their full potential: regulation. Matt Hougan, CIO at Bitwise Asset Management, points out that 2025 will be the year it finally happens. “Clear answers to big questions will spark massive new interest among issuers, consumers, and businesses,” he said . This isn’t just about making crypto traders happy. A proper regulatory framework could bring in the big dogs—banks like J.P. Morgan and traditional financial institutions. With rules in place, they’d be free to issue their own stablecoins, creating a tidal wave of institutional adoption. And the effects would be massive. Coinbase, for example, already has a 50/50 revenue-sharing deal with Circle, the company behind USDC. The more USDC grows, the more Coinbase cashs in on interest income from its reserves. Meanwhile, Robinhood, Kraken, and Galaxy Digital have teamed up to launch USDG, a new dollar-backed stablecoin on what they’re calling the “Global Dollar Network.” And that’s just the beginning. Robinhood literally also acquired Bitstamp earlier this year. Stablecoins and the US dollar’s global dominance The rise of stablecoins isn’t just a crypto story. It’s a US dollar story. Stablecoins are pegged to fiat currencies, mostly the dollar. And as they grow, so does global demand for dollars. Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy co-founder, calls this the US’s big opportunity. “If the US normalizes stablecoins, there’s no reason why banks and companies can’t issue $10 trillion of digital dollars backed by cash reserves,” he said recently. Right now, stablecoins are already making the dollar more accessible in countries with weak currencies or failing banking systems. In these markets, dollar-backed stablecoins are often used for retail payments through smartphone apps. In developed economies, however, they’re expected to start as tools for commercial blockchain applications. But the US is falling behind. Tether, the giant behind USDT, holds a 70% market share. Yet, it’s headquartered in the British Virgin Islands because the US lacks clear rules for issuing cryptos. Regulators like incoming House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill say fixing this is a top priority. He believes stablecoins could extend the dollar’s reserve currency status and boost competition in cross-border payments. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire agrees. He’s calling for federal laws to define stablecoins as legal digital cash. “We need full-reserve digital dollars like stablecoins to become a major export product of the United States,” he said. Ethereum, partnerships, and the next phase of growth Meanwhile, Ethereum has quietly become the backbone of stablecoins. Most of these digital dollars live on its blockchain, making it the most critical network for stablecoin issuance right now. With regulations in sight, Ethereum’s role is only expected to grow. Stablecoins locked into Ethereum’s layer-2 solutions hit a record $13.5 billion before this month is over. Circle and Binance are working to expand USDC adoption by adding more trading pairs and promotions. This is a big deal since USDC currently trails behind USDT in terms of liquidity and trading options. Tether, though, has taken a different approach. It’s winding down its euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, due to low demand and compliance challenges. The clock is ticking for stablecoin legislation Timing is everything. The Trump administration officially begins in January 2025, but analysts warn it could take months before any real policy changes happen. Kenneth Worthington from JPMorgan expects key crypto-related appointments, like chairs for the SEC and CFTC, to come after more urgent cabinet roles. That means real action on stablecoins might not kick in until late 2025. Still, the groundwork is already being laid. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise has made digital asset regulation a top priority for his first 100 days. If stablecoin legislation makes it to the finish line, it could be the breakthrough the industry has been waiting for. For now, stablecoins continue to grow, driven by rising trading volumes and increased adoption in decentralized finance. As of mid-December, stablecoin trading volumes on centralized exchanges hit $1.48 trillion. USDT accounted for 86.3% of those trades. Right now, its market capitalization is around $140 billion.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/daddy-pepe-daddpepe-solana-memecoin-to-surge-11000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes Strong Growth as Altcoin Season Approaches Avalanche (AVAX) is showing promising movement in the crypto market. Its price recently ranged between $42.59 and $57.15, signaling potential upward momentum. The nearest resistance level is at $63.55. If AVAX breaks this, it could reach the next level at $78.12. Over the past month, the price increased by 7.51%, and over six months, it jumped by 43.80%. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 40.93, indicating that the coin is not overbought. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is below the 100-day average, suggesting a possible trend reversal. With the anticipated altcoin season and a bullish market, AVAX has the potential for significant growth ahead. Chainlink Poised for Growth Amid Altcoin Season Hopes Chainlink has shown significant price movements recently. In the past week, its price dropped by about 25%, but over the last month, it climbed nearly 50%. Currently trading between the low twenties and mid-thirties, LINK is demonstrating volatility. The Relative Strength Index is in the low forties, suggesting potential for upward movement. If bullish momentum continues, the price could reach the nearest resistance in the high thirties, and possibly aim for the next level near fifty dollars. The 10-day moving average is below the 100-day average, which may indicate room for growth. With altcoin season anticipated, Chainlink might present a strong opportunity for investors seeking significant returns. Ethena (ENA) Surges with Potential Ahead of Altcoin Season Ethena (ENA) has demonstrated remarkable strength over the past month, jumping 88.10%. While there's been a minor pullback of 3.20% this week, the coin trades confidently between $0.98 and $1.40. The RSI at 54.04 indicates healthy momentum, with room for growth before hitting overbought levels. Breaking through the nearest resistance at $1.55 could see ENA reaching $1.97, offering substantial upside potential. With a 6-month gain of 67.70% and the altcoin season on the horizon, ENA is well-positioned for a significant rally. Sei (SEI) Poised for Breakout as Altcoin Season Looms Sei's price is currently between $0.50 and $0.69, showing signs of stabilizing after recent drops. With the Relative Strength Index at 43.35, the coin is nearing oversold territory, hinting at a possible upward swing. The nearest resistance level is at $0.78; breaking this could propel Sei toward the next target around $0.97. This would represent a significant increase from its current range. Despite a one-week decline of over 32%, the six-month change is up more than 16%, indicating underlying strength. As anticipation builds for a global crypto bull run, Sei seems well-positioned to ride the upcoming altcoin wave. Conclusion Although coins like AVAX, LINK, ENA, and SEI have less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom. Offering a 700% ROI in its presale—from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages—and triple utility, it invites enthusiasts to acquire $CATZILLA and join the battle against crypto villains.

37976321,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106088,1734892224,Singularity Finance And Zoth Team Up To Launch Tokenized Real World Asset ZLTN Prime,"AI blockchain Singularity Finance has announced a partnership with Zoth, the leading developer of on-chain tokenized products for institutions. The collaboration has seen the launch of Zoth Tokenized Liquid Notes Prime (ZTLN-P), a tradable RWA backed by U.S. Treasury ETFs and money market funds (MMFs). ZTLN Prime offers institutional investors a secure solution for acquiring treasury assets while generating consistent returns.ZTLN-P was developed by Cogito, initially under the name of TFUND. Following Cogito’s merger to form Singularity Finance, TFUND will now be issued as ZTLN-P via Cogito’s tokenized fund Ergo Sum SPC. The launch of ZTLN-P will complement Singularity Finance's product suite, which includes treasury management solutions for individuals and entities, alongside other tokenized funds.Using the Blackrock-managed iShares ETFs and MMFs, with a focus on U.S. Treasury bills, ZTLN-P delivers low-risk returns with deep liquidity – qualities that are typically in short supply when it comes to DeFi yields. T-Bills Get the Tokenization TreatmentZTLN-P represents a class of tokenized fund shares managed by established asset managers. This structure offers institutional investors exposure to low-risk, yield-bearing securities.The launch of ZTLN-P, through a collaboration between Zoth and Singularity Finance, provides a first taste of what the Singularity ecosystem will be bringing to market in the months ahead as its scalable L2 gets up to speed. In addition to supporting AI assets, Singularity Finance will seamlessly integrate RWAs with decentralized infrastructure using secure and compliant onchain infrastructure.For Singularity Finance , this partnership represents a further step in integrating real-world assets with AI-focused and data-intensive applications. By leveraging its tokenization framework, Singularity Finance aims to eventually facilitate the tokenization of assets tied to the AI economy.Onchain Treasury Management for Institutional PlayersOne of the reasons why the introduction of ZTLN-P is likely to appeal to institutional investors is on account of the best-in-class treasury management built in courtesy of Singularity Finance combined with Zoth’s sophisticated tokenization framework. This is designed to give investors access to optimized DeFi yields while ensuring strict compliance. As a result, asset managers and institutional investors can efficiently manage their treasury while generating consistent returns. Zoth CEO Pritam Dutta explains: “ZTLN-P is an industry-driven product that aligns institutional-grade short term investments such as Blackrock iShares Treasury Bond ETF with the efficiency and transparency of blockchain. With Singularity Finance’s one-of-a-kind expertise, this partnership marks the beginning of a new era where DeFi is no longer a speculative market but a legitimate alternative to traditional finance.”Why RWAs Are on the RiseUntil recently, most decentralized finance use cases centered on native crypto assets with inherently volatile prices. The introduction of stable, yield-bearing RWAs onto public blockchains signals the start of a new chapter. Institutional participants are more comfortable engaging with assets they recognize and trust, and the legal clarity provided by regulated structures like Ergo Sum SPC’s mutual fund should further encourage institutional participation.Instead of relying on complex yield farming schemes or highly volatile crypto assets, institutional players can now turn to tokenized notes representing real-world bonds and treasuries. This structure not only mitigates risk but also opens the door to a larger pool of sophisticated investors who require robust custody and a clear legal framework.Build It and They Will ComeThe collaboration between Zoth and Singularity Finance is part of a broader trend for DeFi platforms forming partnerships that marry versatile tokenization frameworks with and strong GTM strategies. As more regulated entities participate, the quality of onchain offerings will improve, further lowering the barriers for institutional capital to enter.Beyond short-term liquidity and stable yields, these integrations also pave the way for innovative financial instruments. Once the groundwork is laid with simpler, more traditional assets, the same infrastructure can be extended to more experimental territory, including tokenizing AI services, intellectual property, or data streams. By starting with stable, low-risk yields, RWAs can gain credibility and establish best practices that will ultimately help developers and entrepreneurs branch into more complex and data-driven assets.AI Meets RWAsFor Singularity Finance, ZTLN-P marks another milestone in its ambition to tokenize not only RWAs but also the broader AI economy. As AI becomes a key driver of technological innovation, integrating AI-related data, services, and IP into decentralized finance is the next horizon. The synergy between secure, tokenized TradFi instruments and emerging AI-powered solutions could yield a new generation of financial products that provide greater stability and enhanced functionality.AI-driven models for risk assessment and portfolio optimization could seamlessly interact with tokenized real-world assets, for example, offering algorithmically refined strategies to manage yield and capital allocation. This fusion of AI and tokenized assets highlights how different threads of tech innovation – DeFi, RWA tokenization, and AI – are rapidly coalescing. The future of all this symbiosis is still being mapped out, but the early signs are promising.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/22/singularity-finance-and-zoth-team-up-to-launch-tokenized-real-world-asset-zltn-prime/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=singularity-finance-and-zoth-team-up-to-launch-tokenized-real-world-asset-zltn-prime,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37974577,https://finbold.com/?p=221829,1734892179,Here’s Cardano’s (ADA) path to $6,"Cardano ( ADA ) is flashing familiar signals, with its current price action mirroring an earlier bull cycle that led to massive gains. Specifically, renowned cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a striking similarity between ADA’s 2020 rally and the current market structure, suggesting that a surge to $6 could be on the horizon, he shared in an X post on December 22. In 2020, ADA experienced a steep correction following the initial breakout from its accumulation phase. The first significant dip during ADA’s uptrend occurred at almost the same point in the cycle as the current correction. What followed that correction was a 4,095% rally, taking ADA from under $0.10 to an all-time high above $3 by August 2021. In 2024, Cardano appears to be repeating this pattern . After breaking out from a lengthy accumulation phase, ADA’s price retraced by around 42%, similar to its 2020 pullback. ADA price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts Therefore, if history repeats itself, ADA could climb as high as $6, reflecting an increase of about 560% from the asset’s current valuation. Such a price target would likely put Cardano’s market cap at almost $210 billion, placing it in the third spot among assets with the highest market cap, provided other cryptocurrencies record minimal growth. Martinez initially noted that Cardano could hit the $6 mark between July and September 2025. At the same time, pseudonymous trading expert Kenshiyesreel , in an X post on December 22, observed that ADA would likely target $4 as the next major resistance zone. Based on market structure analysis, the asset appears to have transitioned from an accumulation phase into a markup phase, signaling rising demand and bullish sentiment. The $4 price level coincides with the distribution zone, where overbought conditions may arise. ADA price analysis chart.

Notably, founder Charles Hoskinson envisions a fully decentralized blockchain governance model that includes all users and token holders. Welcome to governance everyone, it's messy and tough, but it's the only way to include everyone.

With the Chang Hard Fork in September 2024 setting the stage for these changes, the ongoing transformation might signal a pivotal growth catalyst for the platform and its native token.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum isn't just another cryptocurrency; it's a game-changer in the digital world. Created by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, it introduced smart contracts and a bustling ecosystem of decentralized apps. It's moved to a Proof-of-Stake system, making it more energy-efficient. With Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, transactions are faster and cheaper. Ethereum also brought us ERC-20 tokens, which are used across many applications for things like governance and utility. Ether (ETH) is the fuel that keeps it all running, used for transactions, rewarding those who stake their coins, and acting as a valuable asset. Looking ahead, Ethereum's future seems bright. The network plans to introduce sharding, which will make it even more scalable and reduce costs. Price predictions based on past trends suggest ETH could reach as high as $6,580.53 next year and might not go lower than $2,700.31 in 2025. Compared to other coins, Ethereum stands out for its strong technology and active development. In the current market, with growing interest in decentralized finance and efficient blockchain solutions, ETH looks like a promising option. Its ongoing innovations and central role in the crypto ecosystem make it an attractive choice for many. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin began in 2013 as a playful twist on the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the lovable Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no cap on the total number. What started as a joke quickly gained a following, showcasing the power of community and social media in driving interest. In 2021, Dogecoin captured global attention as its value skyrocketed. Fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from personalities like Elon Musk, it surged into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, exceeding $50 billion. Technologically, Dogecoin offers faster transaction times and lower fees compared to some of its peers, making it appealing for everyday use. As the crypto market evolves, Dogecoin remains notable for its strong community support and widespread recognition. While its abundant supply contrasts with the scarcity of coins like Bitcoin, its accessibility and enthusiastic following keep it in the conversation amid current market trends. XRP (XRP) Meet XRP, a cryptocurrency designed to revolutionize how we transfer money across the globe. Built on the XRP Ledger, XRP is a digitally native, programmable currency that's fast, low-cost, and open to everyone.

Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP launched with 100 billion tokens, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple for further development. XRP aims to facilitate seamless payment transfers across different currencies, reflecting its name derived from ""ripple credits."" Ripple, initially known as OpenCoin Inc., uses XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem, placing 55 billion XRP in escrow for controlled release. In the current market cycle, XRP stands out for its potential to transform international payments with its speed and efficiency. Compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP offers faster transaction times and lower fees, making it attractive for both individuals and financial institutions. As the crypto market evolves, XRP's focus on real-world utility could position it favorably among its peers. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is making waves in the world of cryptocurrency. It's a platform designed for creating smart contracts, which are like digital agreements that work without middlemen. Cardano's own cryptocurrency is called ADA. People use ADA to store value, make payments, and even earn more by supporting the network. What's exciting is that ADA is seen as a rival to Ethereum's ETH because it offers similar benefits but aims to be more efficient. One thing that sets Cardano apart is its environmentally friendly approach. Instead of using lots of energy like some other cryptocurrencies, Cardano uses a method called proof-of-stake, which is much kinder to the planet. The platform is also divided into two layers, which helps it process many transactions quickly—some say up to a million per second! In today's market, with a growing focus on sustainability and speed, ADA looks very attractive. As more people look for greener options in crypto, Cardano's ADA might be the coin to watch. Conclusion ETH, DOGE, XRP, and ADA are solid, but XYZVerse (XYZ) may outperform them, uniting sports fans and meme culture, targeting 20,000% growth as the G.O.A.T of memecoins.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has experienced notable price fluctuations recently. In the past week, its price declined by 13.66%, moving within a range of $3,648.43 to $4,137.17. Over the last month, however, it saw a gain of 7.75%, indicating some positive momentum amid the volatility. Looking at the six-month timeframe, Ethereum's price decreased by 4.14%, reflecting a mixture of short-term gains and longer-term challenges. Technical indicators provide insight into Ethereum's current state. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 31.82, which is near the oversold threshold. This suggests that the asset may be undervalued at present levels. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $3,403.46, below the 100-day average of $3,807.62, showing a dip in short-term pricing compared to the longer-term trend. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is at -85.71, indicating bearish momentum, while the stochastic value of 13.16 is low, often associated with oversold conditions. Considering support and resistance levels, if Ethereum's price moves upward, it may encounter resistance at $4,317.86, which is about 18% above the current lower price range. Surpassing this, the next resistance level is $4,806.60, approximately 32% higher. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $3,340.38, about 9% below the current price. If the price falls further, the second support level is $2,851.64, representing a potential decline of roughly 22%. These levels are key areas that may influence Ethereum's price action in the near future. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced significant volatility lately.

The nearest resistance level is $0.00003614, and the closest support level is $0.00002006. If the price breaks above the resistance, it could target the second resistance at $0.00004418, representing a substantial percentage increase. On the downside, falling below the support might see the price testing the second support level at $0.00001202. Technical indicators offer more insights. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.00002187, below the 100-day average of $0.00002547. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 32.79, while the Stochastic is at 28.66, both suggesting that SHIB is approaching oversold territory. The MACD level is negative at -0.0000006701, indicating bearish momentum. These factors might imply potential for a price reversal or further decline, making SHIB a coin to watch closely.

Starting with a whopping one quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. This bold move built trust, and when Buterin donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, SHIB grabbed the spotlight. What makes SHIB stand out is its potential for real-world use. Unlike Dogecoin, which is mostly known for its meme status, SHIB's Ethereum foundation allows it to support projects like ShibaSwap, its own decentralized exchange. There are also plans for an NFT platform and a system where holders can help decide the project's future. In today's market, where investors look for coins with practical applications, SHIB's growing ecosystem could make it an attractive option. As cryptocurrencies evolve, those that offer more than just hype may thrive, and SHIB seems ready to take on that challenge. Dogwifhat (WIF) A new dog-themed meme coin has entered the crypto scene: Dogwifhat (WIF). Inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme, WIF is gaining popularity for its fun and community-driven approach. Built on the Solana blockchain, it joins a pack of dog-themed tokens that have made waves in the crypto world. Meme coins like WIF are known for their viral nature, often spreading through social media and online communities. What sets WIF apart is its base on Solana, a fast and scalable blockchain. This could give it an edge in terms of transaction speed and fees compared to other meme coins on slower networks. In the current market cycle, where there's a growing interest in meme coins and community-led projects, WIF might catch the eye of crypto enthusiasts looking for the next big thing. Whether WIF will stand out in the crowded meme coin space remains to be seen, but its unique charm and the strength of its community might give it a fighting chance. PEPE (PEPE) PEPE is a new memecoin that pays tribute to Pepe the Frog, a popular internet meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. Launched on Ethereum, PEPE has quickly gained attention by embracing the fun and simplicity of meme culture. With a no-tax policy and an upfront admission of its lack of utility, PEPE keeps things pure and simple. In late April to May 2023, PEPE's value skyrocketed, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion at one point. Early investors saw huge gains, and a strong community of fans rallied behind the coin. This surge sparked what some call a ""memecoin season,"" with other meme-inspired coins experiencing wild rides in value. PEPE aims to join the ranks of other famous memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Its roadmap has three phases: getting listed on CoinMarketCap and trending on Twitter, securing listings on centralized exchanges, and finally, achieving ""tier 1"" exchange listings and a ""meme takeover."" Whether PEPE looks attractive in the current market depends on one's appetite for risk. The crypto market is known for its volatility, especially with memecoins that can pump and dump rapidly. As the Bitcoin halving approaches, many hope for a bull run that could lift coins like PEPE. While PEPE has captured the imagination of many, it's important to stay informed in this unpredictable market. Bonk (BONK) Meet BONK, the memecoin that's capturing attention on the Solana blockchain. With its charming Shiba Inu mascot, BONK aims to give power back to the community by shifting it away from big venture capital holders. It made headlines by soaring over 100% after getting listed on Coinbase. Half of its total supply was airdropped to participants in Solana's NFT and DeFi projects, making it truly a coin for the people. By mid-December 2023, BONK had become the third-largest memecoin by market cap, enjoying a staggering year-to-date rise of over 10,000%. Despite facing challenges like a large total supply and the ups and downs common in memecoins, BONK is carving out a notable place in the crypto world. Its integration into Solana's growing ecosystem of decentralized apps sets it apart from other memecoins. The launch of BonkSwap, its own decentralized exchange, is a significant step forward. In the current market cycle, BONK's blend of community focus and active development makes it an interesting option to watch. Compared to other coins, its rapid growth and strong community support highlight its potential in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency space. SPX6900 (SPX) In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, SPX6900 has emerged from internet culture as a playful yet ambitious contender. This meme token is on a bold mission to surpass the S&P 500 by targeting a colossal $69 trillion market cap. The idea is simple and humorous: if 6900 is greater than 500, then SPX6900 must be superior to any traditional financial instrument. This lighthearted logic has captured the imagination of a community that thrives on big numbers and even bigger aspirations. While SPX6900 began as a meme, it's riding the wave of a market that appreciates innovation and disruption. The token symbolizes a challenge to traditional finance, fueled by the belief that the digital economy can redefine wealth and investment. In the current market cycle, where investors are exploring beyond conventional assets, SPX6900 presents an intriguing, if not entirely serious, option. Its potential lies not just in numbers, but in the community and culture that support it. As similar meme tokens have seen substantial growth, SPX6900 could be attractive to those who enjoy the blend of humor and high-risk, high-reward investments. Conclusion SHIB, WIF, PEPE, and BONK are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) aims for 20,000% growth by uniting meme culture and sports in a community-driven ecosystem.

As investors seek innovative projects with real-world use cases, Lightchain AI offers exciting potential for substantial growth. Ethereum’s Market Position and Growing Competition Ethereum (ETH) has made its place as the two-largest crypto by market size, now trading at $3,531.13. Even with its lead, Ethereum sees more competition from new blockchain sites. Solana (SOL), for example, gives speedier deals and cheaper fees making it a strong choice. Also, Cardano (ADA) has caught eye for its proof-of-stake way of agreeing, which is more energy saving than Ethereum's old proof-of-work style. These rivals are drawi͏ng in builders and folks looking for growth and low costs. Ethereum's answer has ongoing network fixes and the switch to Ethereum 2, it aims to boost growth and cut fees. While Ethereum maintains a strong market position, its ability to adapt to these competitive pressures will be crucial for sustaining its leadership in the evolving blockchain landscape.

Analysts predict this altcoin could surge by an astonishing 16,900%, sparking interest among investors. Is this the next digital asset poised for massive growth? This article investigates the factors that could lead to a significant increase in value and its implications for the market. Trump's Victory Sparks Crypto Chaos: $XYZ Meme Coin Ready to Deliver a 99,900% Knockout Donald Trump’s election victory has triggered a seismic shift in the crypto market, setting the stage for a bull run like no other. As the dust settles, major coins limp forward with uninspiring double-digit gains, while meme coins are stealing the show. PNUT’s recent 4,500% surge? FRED’s 6,000% explosion? Ancient history, buried in the ashes of short-lived hype. These coins buckled under selling pressure, leaving FOMO-ridden investors licking their wounds. But the crypto battlefield doesn’t wait for the weak — a new titan has emerged with plans to obliterate profit records and deliver an earth-shaking 99,900% surge. Take the XYZ Side - The Undisputed Champion of Meme Coins $XYZ Breaks into the Ring to Knockout Meme Coin Legends Meet $XYZ - the first-ever all-sports memecoins for true crypto degens hungry for 1000X profits. This is the token for those who thrive on the thrill of competition. As Trump takes the reins, the crypto market is set to erupt so the competition is getting fierce. Only the strongest tokens can survive in this no-mercy arena. Here comes the dawn of a crypto era for those with balls of steel — the guys like Joe Rogan and Dana White — who’d proudly rally behind Trump’s team. With such true men of business on board, there is no place for old pussy meme coins, it's time for real brutal coins. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors and rocket to the moon on Elon Musk’s mission. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price.

XRP (XRP) Over the past six months, XRP has shown significant growth, with its price increasing by over 360%. In the last month, the price surged by approximately 105%, indicating strong upward momentum. However, the past week saw a slight dip of about 3%. Currently trading between $2.03 and $2.73, XRP is approaching its resistance level at $3.02. A break above this could propel it toward the next resistance at $3.73, representing a significant gain. On the downside, support levels at $1.61 and $0.9041 provide a safety net against declines. Technical indicators present mixed signals. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.28, just below the 100-day SMA of $2.44, suggesting short-term bearishness. The Relative Strength Index is around 43, indicating the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0252, hinting at potential consolidation. Overall, XRP's robust performance suggests potential for further growth, especially if it can surpass key resistance levels. Conclusion As the crypto market surges, tokens like XRP hold promise, but XYZVerse (XYZ) aims higher by uniting sports fans in a unique memecoin with massive growth potential.

37973710,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666243,1734890421,XRP Battles Critical $2.20 Support Level — Will It Target $2.70 Or Slip To $1.96?,"XRP has been trading in a decline over the past few days alongside the broader cryptocurrency market. However, despite this lull, the XRP price has managed to maintain its critical support levels and is currently positioning itself for a potential recovery. Related Reading: Ethereum Investment: Trump Crypto Project Grabs 722 ETH At $2.5 Million Interestingly, technical analysis highlights the $2.20 mark as a key level to watch for XRP going forward. This was noted in an analysis by popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez, who emphasized that XRP’s next major move could hinge on its outcome on this threshold. Key Levels To Watch: $2.20 Support And $2.70 Resistance The cryptocurrency market has faced significant selling pressure since December 17 led by Bitcoin’s break below support levels, leading to notable price corrections across various cryptocurrencies. XRP, in particular, saw its price fall from $2.708 on December 17 to bottom at $1.98 on December 20. This represented a 27% in three days. After it reached $1.98, the XRP price rebounded and regained the $2 price level. As it stands, XRP is now trading around $2.2, although it is still down by 7% in the weekly timeframe. XRP’s movement around the $2.2 price level has captured the attention of crypto analyst Ali Martinez, who suggested two ways the cryptocurrency can go from here. According to Ali Martinez, XRP’s ability to hold above the $2.20 support is crucial for its short-term bullish outlook. If this level remains intact, the token might enter a consolidation phase, but another attempt at the $2.70 resistance remains in play. From here, a strong bullish momentum above $2.7 could as well send the cryptocurrency above $3 for the first time in years. On the other hand, a break below $2.20 could trigger another quick XRP price decline toward $1.96 before it starts to attract fresh buying interest. Image From X: ali_charts Whale Accumulation Up Amid Crypto Market Correction On-chain data from Santiment suggests that XRP has captured the interest of whales during this recent downturn. Wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP coins have accumulated an additional 80 million XRP since December 17, which points to strong confidence in the token’s long-term potential among whale addresses. This accumulation could provide a cushion against further declines below the $2 mark and set the stage for an eventual recovery. Related Reading: Dogecoin Dives: $29 Million Disappears During Market Collapse —Data Adding to the bullish outlook, technical analysis of the XRP price using Elliot impulse waves suggests that the recent crash below $2 might be the end of the second impluse wave, which is a corrective wave. With this in mind, bullish impulse wave 3 is expected to start anytime soon. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.27.

37973796,https://thecoinrise.com/incoming-bitcoin-breakout-predicted-as-social-sentiment-drops/,1734890409,Incoming Bitcoin Breakout Predicted As Social Sentiment Drops,"Bitcoin (BTC) is likely headed towards a recovery season before finally soaring above $100,000. Historical chart patterns suggest that this might be the case after the social sentiment around the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization recently hit a low. Noteworthy, this is the lowest that this metric has gotten to since the beginning of 2024. Low Retail Investors’ Sentiment in Bitcoin Market The social sentiment went to an average ratio of four to five positive versus negative Bitcoin-related comments. In other words, there are fewer positive Bitcoin-related statements than negative ones. At Santiment, a blockchain analytics platform, analysts believe such low retail investor sentiment could signal an incoming Bitcoin breakout. In its December 22 post on X, Santiment wrote , “Vocal traders are now showing severe FUD, and that’s good news for contrarians who know markets move in the opposite direction of retail’s expectations.” More Analysts Expect Bitcoin Price Correction Comparatively, Santiment is not alone in this, as other analysts and market experts expect a price correction for Bitcoin. The coin’s daily chart produced three consecutive red candles for the first time since the first week in November. Recall that this was when the United States presidential elections were held, and Republican politician Donald Trump won. In an earlier post, popular analyst Elja Boom wrote that Bitcoin could be set to recover above $100,000 in the short term. He based his expectation on emerging fractals on the daily chart while adding that such a trend has happened before. Bitcoin Trades Below $97,000 According to CoinMarketCap data, BTC’s price has decreased by approximately 11.32% from its all-time high (ATH) of $108,000, which it accomplished on December 17. The coin currently trades at $95,751.75 after losing 6.87% of its 24-hour price gain. The anticipated recovery could come before the end of the year or not. However, crypto analyst Rekt Capital sees the possibility of the correction extending by another week. To give credence to this prediction, the analyst shared an instance in 2017 when Week 7 and Weeks 8 and 9 were corrective. Another example is 2021, when Week 6 and Week 8 were corrective.

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino is unveiling Tether’s vision to launch a platform that will enable people to interact with artificial intelligence using their mobile phones, reports Bloomberg. Tether plans to launch the AI platform in the first quarter of 2025 as the company rakes in net profits of more than $10 billion this year. Ardoino says at least half of the profits will be allocated to AI and other investments next year. “Next year we plan to deploy at least half of the profits in investment. Our investment is just at the beginning.” Data from CoinMarketCap shows that USDT now has a market cap of about $140 billion, up by nearly $50 billion this year. Demand for the dollar-pegged asset surged as the crypto market rallied with Bitcoin ( BTC ) breaching the six-digit mark. In a report published earlier this month, Tether says the number of wallets holding USDT rose by 71% in 2024. The firm says that at the start of Q4 2024, there were 109 million on-chain wallets holding USDT– more than twice the number of wallets holding Bitcoin. USDT also remains the leading stablecoin in terms of adoption with four times more wallets than all other stablecoins combined.

37976718,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/investors-are-closely-watching-this-altcoin-for-signs-of-a-significant-breakout,1734889738,Investors Are Closely Watching This Altcoin for Signs of a Significant Breakout,"As the crypto market evolves, savvy investors are turning their attention to emerging altcoins with the potential for massive gains. One such token making waves is Lightchain AI (LCAI) currently in its presale phase and already generating significant buzz. With its unique technology and ability to disrupt multiple industries, LCAI is capturing the interest of crypto traders worldwide. Many are closely watching its presale as a potential opportunity to get in early on what could be the next big breakout. Here's why Lightchain AI is on everyone’s radar. What Makes Lightchain AI (LCAI) Stand Out in the Crypto Space? Lightchain AI is not just another cryptocurrency; it represents a fusion of two powerful technologies—blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that rely on decentralized finance (DeFi) or store of value use cases, LCAI aims to leverage AI to solve real-world problems, from predictive analytics to machine learning. This unique combination of blockchain and AI gives LCAI a competitive edge, making it stand out as a highly innovative project in a crowded market. One of the standout features of LCAI is its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), which allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) powered by AI. This could bring groundbreaking changes across industries such as finance, healthcare, and logistics—creating a demand for AI-powered blockchain solutions that LCAI is uniquely positioned to fulfill. How the Market is Responding to Lightchain AI’s Growing Potential As LCAI continues to develop and gain traction, investor interest is growing. LCAI’s presale has already drawn significant attention, with early investors snapping up tokens at a low price point, recognizing its potential for exponential growth. With LCAI’s innovative technology and promising roadmap, institutional and retail investors alike are watching closely to see when the token will break out into the mainstream market. While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have gained popularity due to strong community support, LCAI is taking a more strategic approach by integrating AI technology into its platform. This positions LCAI as a potential leader in the AI-powered blockchain space, differentiating itself from meme coins and making it a more viable long-term investment. Key Drivers for LCAI’s Potential Breakout Several factors make LCAI an exciting altcoin to watch for a significant breakout: AI and Blockchain Integration The combination of AI and blockchain is a hot trend in the tech world. As AI becomes an integral part of industries like healthcare, finance, and governance, LCAI’s ability to support AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) puts it in a prime position to benefit from the rapid growth of the AI industry. Tokenomics One of LCAI’s key features is its tokenomics, which includes the burning of transaction fees. This ensures that the LCAI token will become scarcer over time, potentially driving its value upward as demand increases. Strong Market Sentiment: LCAI is gaining increasing attention from institutional investors and crypto whales, who are eager to back projects with solid utility. The growing interest in LCAI reflects confidence in the token’s potential for significant gains. Innovative Consensus Mechanism LCAI’s Proof of Intelligence (PoI) is a unique consensus mechanism that rewards users for completing AI computations—a more energy-efficient and useful alternative to traditional consensus models like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). Will Lightchain AI Break Out to the Next Level? With the crypto market preparing for another bull run, LCAI is well-positioned to take advantage of its growing adoption and the increasing demand for AI-powered blockchain solutions. Investors are keeping a close eye on the token, anticipating when it will hit the mainstream market, with many predicting a significant breakout in the coming months. LCAI stands out due to its technological innovation, offering groundbreaking AI-powered blockchain applications that differentiate it from other projects in the space. Additionally, with its current price below $0.003, the token presents high growth potential, promising massive returns for early investors if the project achieves even a fraction of its ambitious roadmap. Furthermore, the rising demand for AI-powered applications across industries adds to LCAI’s potential, positioning it as a strong contender for success and a likely breakout star in the near future. Lightchain AI – An Altcoin to Watch As the LCAI presale continues to gain traction and the technology behind the project begins to take shape, the potential for LCAI to break out into the mainstream market becomes increasingly clear. Investors are closely watching LCAI for signs that the token will experience significant growth in the coming months, and with its combination of AI and blockchain technology, it’s well-positioned for a breakout. For those looking to get in early on an altcoin with tremendous potential, LCAI should be at the top of your watchlist. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto trader or a newcomer, this emerging altcoin offers a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of what could be the next big success story in the crypto space. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

37973300,https://crypto.news/?p=14321457,1734889525,Solana Turned $400 into $68800 in 202; this SOL token aims to replicate that success,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana’s 2021 bull run turned small investments into fortunes; now Rexas Finance (RXS) is being eyed as the next big crypto opportunity. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: The Foundation of real-world asset tokenization Solana vs. Rexas Finance: A comparative outlook Predicting RXS’s potential returns RXS: The best bet Solana’s incredible bull run in 2021 transformed small investments into fortunes and shocked everyone. The price of Solana more than tripled following growing demand in the DeFi community and NFT hype. By the close of 2022, the hype had nearly dissipated, and now investors are vying for the next opportunity as the crypto market looks ready to take its next leap. Recent developments regarding Rexas Finance have raised some eyebrows as a potential “Solana killer” owing to its robust ecosystem and tokenomics in 2024. Those who missed the Solana boom but still want to secure and accumulate wealth through the crypto boom, RXS can help you right the wrongs. Crypto whales purchased RXS token You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Rexas Finance: The Foundation of real-world asset tokenization Rexas Finance is carving out a niche addressing an even larger market: real-world assets. These include real estate, gold, art, and countless others, which are also accessible online. Here’s a fun fact to remember: gold and art account for over 121.2 trillion and 65 billion dollars, respectively. At the same time, the global real estate industry alone is worth almost 379.7 trillion dollars. Rexas Finance’s tokenization initiative is opening doors of opportunities for people off the streets for investments that have remained impossible otherwise. This is not only DeFi; it is the direction of world finance. As of this date, Rexas Finance is at $0.150 for presale stage 10. It’s picking up speed, as 92.95 % of stage 10 has already been completed. After stage 10, the price will increase by 15.38% to $0.175. Early investors can expect an average 400% profit in under three years, as the token is set to hit three top-tier exchanges at $0.20. At the same time, the token is strongly positioned and ranked among the top ten cryptocurrencies. This led some market analysts to forecast that Rexas Finance will have a market capitalization of $67 billion by 2025. While Solana’s trajectory towards $400 is captivating, the real opportunity lies in identifying potentially very promising businesses at an earlier stage, making RXS difficult to miss out on at $0.150. Experts expect it could reach the $50 benchmark in 2025. The plan with RXS is to start trading cheaply at $50 in 2025, which translates to more than 33,000% in profits. Solana vs. Rexas Finance: A comparative outlook The key for Solana has always been having developer bases while always maintaining usability, and this is evident in the token’s onset of growth from a few dollars to $263 at its peak. However, scalability and centralization remain key areas for the latter. Conversely, Rexas Finance creates strong foundations for sustainable growth by anticipating challenges as a blockchain company within its ecosystem. With more than just a copious number of use cases for its technology, it leads by example in integrating with real economies. With the addition of artificial intelligence for yield enhancement and a treasury system aimed at decentralization, it has opportunities to go above and beyond Solana. Predicting RXS’s potential returns If RXS replicates Solana’s success, an investment of $400 at the present presale value of $0.150 could generate returns of a whopping $133,333.33 should it hit $50 in the next few years. This projection is based on its growing adoption, unique ecosystem, and potential to disrupt traditional asset markets. The growth trends evident across its adoption, innovative systems, and propensity to pursue the evolution of asset integration will give Rexas plenty of opportunities in the coming years. Additionally, RXS’s earning potential is further anchored by attributes like its listing in several crypto exchange trackers and its ability to showcase CertiK-audited contracts. The token’s existence is backed by a collection of clearly defined milestones borne of institutional interest, thereby ensuring longevity and growth irrespective of market trends. RXS: The best bet Rexas Finance offers everyone a unique chance to invest a mere $400 and make over $133,000 in weeks. The RXS token presale has picked up pace and is expected to aggravate the crypto landscape by tokenizing real-world assets and sophisticated blockchain technologies. RXS is expected to move its 11th presale stage soon. Now could be the time to invest in this project, understand the future of asset ownership, and trade with blockchain.

Experts suggest it could achieve growth akin to giants like Binance Coin (BNB) or Solana (SOL). With its presale price at just $0.003, LCAI’s utility-driven foundation and forward-thinking roadmap set it apart from speculative meme coins. As the presale continues at lightchain.ai , many wonder if this could be the next transformative player in the crypto space. Legacy of Crypto Giants Coins like Binance Coin (BNB) and Solana (SOL) did not get their current power in one night. Binance Coin, for example, began as a helpful token for cuts on fees at the Binance shop but its fast growth made it one of the best goods out there in the market. Solana, meanwhile caught eyes with its unmatched speed and low costs to trade fixing problems that troubled past blockchains. Both coins have a shared link—strong basics, creative tech, and strong group help. These things helped them move through market ups and downs and keep their spots as leaders in the crypto world.

Why Experts Predict 11x Growth Experts are forecasting an 11x growth potential for Lightchain A I (LCAI) based on its innovative approach and market timing. The token’s combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain positions it to capitalize on two rapidly growing sectors. Unlike many early-stage projects, LCAI boasts a strong foundation with advanced AI integration, a clear roadmap, and robust tokenomics designed for scalability and utility.

Analysts point to its ability to address real-world challenges in decentralized finance (DeFi), including scalability, efficiency, and user accessibility, as key drivers of its anticipated growth. As investor demand grows for projects that blend innovation with practicality, LCAI’s strategic focus and strong fundamentals make it a standout candidate for exponential returns. Role of AI in Blockchain Evolution Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the blockchain industry by addressing critical challenges such as scalability, security, and efficiency. By integrating AI, blockchain projects can optimize transaction speeds, enhance smart contract functionality, and improve data analysis for decentralized finance (DeFi) and other applications.

37973003,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cryptocurrency-exchange-coinbase-shares-5-predictions-for-2025/,1734889028,Cryptocurrency Exchange Coinbase Shares 5 Predictions for 2025,"In a new report, Coinbase has outlined its vision for the cryptocurrency market through 2025 and shared five key trends that are expected to shape the industry. The report covers the development of stablecoins, tokenization, cryptocurrency ETFs, decentralized finance (DeFi), and regulatory clarity. Coinbase predicts that stablecoins, often referred to as crypto’s “crucial asset,” will move beyond traditional commerce use cases. They are expected to facilitate a broader range of financial transactions, powering the next phase of global digital payments. The report notes that tokenization is a transformative force in the current market cycle. While challenges remain, on-chain tokenization of real-world assets such as real estate and stocks could become a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem. Coinbase notes that ETFs have permanently changed the supply-demand dynamics for crypto assets. The success of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs has spurred institutional adoption, with endowments, pension funds, hedge funds, and family offices increasingly investing in crypto ETFs. Related News: Analysts Discussed: ""Bitcoin Should Never Go Below This Level, Crash Could Be 100 Times Worse Than FTX and LUNA Crashes"" Going forward, Coinbase expects more innovations in the ETF space, such as the inclusion of staking mechanisms and the elimination of cash-only requirements for ETF stake creation and redemption. These changes could improve ETF price alignment, narrow bid-ask spreads, and increase returns for investors. Despite downturns in previous market cycles, decentralized finance is poised for a resurgence thanks to new innovations and applications. Coinbase predicts that DeFi will evolve into a more robust and accessible financial ecosystem in the coming years. One of the most promising developments highlighted in the report is the shift in regulatory attitudes. Coinbase envisions a clearer and more logical regulatory framework that will benefit both the crypto industry and consumers. Regulatory clarity is expected to transform from a hindrance to a support factor, encouraging growth and stability in the market. Coinbase notes the profound impact spot Bitcoin ETFs have had on institutional adoption, describing them as a stabilizing force in the crypto market. While the focus remains on potential approvals for spot ETFs tied to tokens like XRP, SOL, LTC, and HBAR, the report tempers expectations of significant institutional demand beyond a select few assets. *This is not investment advice.

Solana's SOL: A High-Speed Blockchain for Scalable Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform that prioritizes scalability, offering a foundation for decentralized applications with faster transactions and support for multiple programming languages. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to the ecosystem, enabling transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. Unlike some platforms that rely on sharding or second-layer solutions, Solana focuses on a high-capacity network to attract developers and investors. The potential of SOL lies in its ability to support a wide range of high-activity projects and services. In the current market cycle, Solana's emphasis on speed and scalability positions it as an attractive option for those interested in decentralized applications and blockchain technology. Toncoin (TON): Cryptocurrency of the Decentralized Open Network Toncoin (TON) is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a decentralized, open-source layer-1 blockchain supported by the TON Foundation and community contributors. Initially developed by Telegram as Telegram Open Network with the 'Gram' token, the project was discontinued in May 2020 following an SEC court order. Renamed and continued by the community, Toncoin operates on a proof-of-stake consensus model, enhancing scalability and reliability. It aims to provide fast, secure payment services with minimal fees and develop an ecosystem including decentralized storage, services, DNS, anonymous networking, and efficient payment processing. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Toncoin shows potential for growth, suggesting attractiveness in the current market cycle. Aptos (APT): A Scalable Blockchain Focusing on Safety and Flexibility Aptos (APT) is a new blockchain designed to address high transaction fees and network congestion found in systems like Ethereum before its Proof-of-Stake transition. Developed by Aptos Labs, founded by key contributors from Meta's Diem project, it employs a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Aptos uses the Move programming language for smart contracts, highlighting safety, scalability, and flexibility. It supports a wide range of Web3 applications. With its strong development team and focus on solving existing blockchain issues, Aptos has significant potential. In the current market cycle, its innovative approach to scalability and security may make it an attractive option for users and developers. Polkadot (DOT): Enabling Secure Communication Between Blockchains Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains. It allows value and data to be shared across networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without the need for intermediaries. By employing parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Polkadot token (DOT) is used for governance and staking within its network, allowing holders to participate in decision-making and transaction verification. Developed by Ethereum co-creator Gavin Wood and maintained by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot launched on May 26, 2020. Its focus on interoperability and efficiency positions it as a significant player in the evolving blockchain landscape, attracting attention in the current market cycle. Conclusion While SOL, TON, APT, and DOT may offer gains, they have less short-term potential. DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. With expected 700% growth by the end of the presale and potential thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows successful tokens like BONK and Popcat. It builds a community of leaders aiming to dominate, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

37972904,https://crypto.news/?p=14321392,1734888763,Binance founder Changpeng Zhao sparks debate over UAE’s alleged $40b Bitcoin holdings,"Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has triggered a discussion about cryptocurrency adoption in the UAE after sharing claims about the nation’s Bitcoin holdings. In a recent X tweet, Zhao shared an article claiming the United Arab Emirates holds $40 billion in Bitcoin ( BTC ). The figure immediately drew attention from industry observers, particularly crypto lawyer Irina Heaver. https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1870792041288118677?s=46&t=hwYzHTuEZToDaG1FB0ZrIg Heaver challenged the article’s credibility, suggesting it appeared to be AI-generated content lacking evidence for its claims. Responding to the skepticism, Zhao acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding the specific figure, noting, “I also wondered how they came up with the exact number; it’s challenging to collect.” Screenshot from X Zhao added that while the amount exceeded his expectations, it could be plausible given the number of high-net-worth individuals in the region. The discussion prompted Zhao to look back on his role in developing the UAE’s cryptocurrency ecosystem. He described witnessing Dubai’s change from hosting “only a handful of crypto companies” in 2021 to becoming home to thousands of blockchain-related businesses. Zhao stated, “I certainly did a lot of shilling here. But didn’t know the number was so big or how much of that could be attributed to my efforts.” The exchange has brought to light Dubai’s initiatives in the cryptocurrency sector, including the Dubai Multi Commodities Center’s Crypto Center, which has created a favorable environment for blockchain startups and digital asset investments. These regulatory frameworks and government efforts have successfully brought numerous international crypto companies to establish operations in the region. The debate over the UAE’s Bitcoin holdings comes at a time when the nation is actively positioning itself as a global cryptocurrency hub. While the exact value of national cryptocurrency holdings remains unverified, the discussion underscores the UAE’s growing influence in the crypto space.

Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! 🚀 Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within Ethereum's ecosystem. The coin started with a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and ""burned"" 40% of the total supply, reducing circulation. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB aims for broader utility by developing platforms like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform and governance system. Its integration with Ethereum allows for potential growth in decentralized applications. Conclusion With SHIB and other tokens showing less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. Expected 700% growth by presale's end and potential thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN follows tokens like BONK and Popcat. Building a community of alpha leaders, it offers real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/electric-elon-musk-elecmusk-solana-memecoin-to-rally-18000-ahead-of-exchange-listings-while-shib-and-doge-struggle/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin has no maximum cap and adds 10,000 new coins every minute. Initially seen as a joke, its value soared in 2021, breaking into the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market value over $50 billion. This rise was fueled by social media and support from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin's strong community and broad appeal show its potential. In the current market cycle, it remains a significant player, and its active community might attract those interested in cryptocurrency. Conclusion While coins like DOGE offer less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out for those pursuing excellence and success. With expected 700% growth before launch and potential thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows in the footsteps of BONK, WIF, and Popcat.

37972212,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375243,1734887433,Treasury Cracks Down on North Korean Sanctions Evasion Through Crypto Laundering,"The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has sanctioned two individuals and one entity involved in a network laundering millions of dollars in illicit funds for North Korea. Lu Huaying and Zhang Jian, based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), used a UAE-based front company to facilitate money laundering and cryptocurrency conversion, funneling the proceeds back to Pyongyang. OFAC Imposes Sanctions In its official press release on December 17th, the OFAC stated that North Korea continues to rely on agents and proxies to access the global financial system for illicit activities. The agency added these operations are part of the country’s broader efforts to destabilize international security, now extending to Europe with increasing military ties to Russia. Sim Hyon Sop, a representative of the DPRK’s Korea Kwangson Banking Corp (KKBC) based in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), is said to be a key figure in these activities. Operating as an agent for North Korean financial institutions, Sim is accused of orchestrating money laundering schemes, establishing shell companies, and managing bank accounts to move illicit funds. The OFAC previously designated Sim and KKBC under Executive Order 13382, targeting entities that support WMD proliferation. Sim’s operations primarily involve digital assets to funnel money back to North Korea’s missile programs. Since 2022, Huaying has been allegedly involved in laundering millions of dollars of illicit funds derived from DPRK activities by converting cryptocurrency into fiat currency. Between 2022 and September 2023, the accused used various methods, including money mules, to facilitate these transactions. Meanwhile, Jian also helped facilitate the exchange of fiat currency and acted as a courier for Sim. OFAC is designating both Huaying and Zhang Jian, along with Green Alpine Trading, LLC, a UAE-based front company involved in the network, for their roles in supporting Sim’s illicit activities. Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith stated, “As the DPRK continues to use complex criminal schemes to fund its WMD and ballistic missile programs – including through the exploitation of digital assets – Treasury remains focused on disrupting the networks that facilitate this flow of funds to the regime. The United States, along with the UAE and our other partners, will continue to target the financial networks that enable the Kim regime’s destabilizing activities.” North Korean Hackers Execute Wide-Ranging Crypto Heist North Korea’s involvement in cybercrime has wreaked significant havoc in the crypto industry, as evidenced by a series of high-profile hacks and exploits. In August, ZachXBT reported that North Korean developers infiltrated over 25 crypto projects using fake identities, stealing $1.3 million through malicious code. In October, reports emerged that North Korean hackers linked to Lazarus Group used a fake NFT game exploiting a Chrome zero-day flaw to steal wallet credentials. The game, promoted via social engineering tactics, included malware that harvested sensitive data. Despite a fix from Google, the attackers had already executed large-scale crypto thefts. Then in November, South Korean police confirmed that North Korean hacking groups Lazarus and Andariel orchestrated the 2019 Upbit crypto heist, stealing $50 million worth of ETH. Collaboration with the FBI and Swiss prosecutors uncovered key evidence, including North Korean IP addresses and virtual asset flow patterns. The stolen funds were laundered through multiple platforms. More recently, Radiant Capital confirmed that a $50 million hack on its DeFi platform in October 2024 was carried out by a North Korea-linked hacking group. The attackers used a Telegram-based malware scheme to exploit a developer, leading to the installation of a macOS backdoor.

Stellar (XLM): Bridging Global Payments with Blockchain Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized payments network that uses blockchain to enable fast and low-cost fund transfers. It does not favor any national currency and has its own cryptocurrency, Stellar Lumens. Since it started in 2014, Stellar has processed billions of transactions and partnered with major companies. It stands out by allowing transfers of any currency type, including digital versions of national currencies and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Unlike some cryptocurrencies that aim to replace financial systems, Stellar aims to enhance them. It offers a unified network for different financial systems to work together. People can transfer funds globally using Stellar apps, and companies can build blockchain applications or use the network for payments and currency conversion. Conclusion In conclusion, while coins like POL, KAS, SUI, and XLM may offer some potential, they might not yield significant short-term gains. CYBRO, however, stands out as a technologically advanced DeFi platform that provides investors with unmatched opportunities to boost their earnings. Its AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, along with features like attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, delivers a superior user experience with easy deposits and withdrawals.

Finnish authorities are pursuing Schueler’s arrest based on tax evasion allegations spanning from June 2, 2020, to April 2, 2024. The case has gained additional gravity as Schueler now appears on Europe’s most wanted fugitives list, where authorities detail disturbing assault allegations involving a minor.

Despite the surge in active wallets, DOGE has lost 14.1% over the past month and is trading at $0.39. DOGE’s price decline is due to the reduction in the broader interest in meme coins.

37971603,https://finbold.com/?p=221818,1734886047,AI picks 2 altcoins set to outperform Bitcoin in January 2025,"Bitcoin ( BTC ) is seeking to extend its impressive 2024 run into the new year, aiming to reclaim and establish its price above the $100,000 mark. This potential surge is fueled by industry optimism, with some market players expecting the asset to climb higher , driven by the sustainability of the post-election momentum despite the current short-term volatility. While Bitcoin leads the charge, several altcoins also show strong potential to rally, possibly even outperforming BTC. With this in mind, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o for insights on which altcoin could take center stage. XRP The artificial intelligence (AI) tool highlighted that XRP’s future looks brighter than ever, thanks to recent favorable developments in a legal battle between Ripple and the Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The latest updates from the case indicate that the chances of XRP being reclassified as a security have diminished. Additionally, Gary Gensler’s upcoming exit as the head of the SEC is viewed as a bullish trigger for the asset. There is speculation that the case could be thrown out entirely if crypto-friendly Paul Atkins is confirmed to lead the regulator. With the new administration set to take over, XRP could rally further, building on its recent breakout amid anticipation of possible approval for a related exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). Overall, ChatGPT stressed that positive regulatory outcomes could spark massive institutional adoption, driving the asset’s value upwards. At the same time, the OpenAI platform noted that Ripple’s established partnerships with financial institutions for cross-border transactions further cement its role as a bridge currency, which could boost demand. It’s worth noting that XRP is among the standout winners of the current bull market, having broken out of a prolonged consolidation phase below $1. XRP is exhibiting short-term bearish sentiments aligning with the broader cryptocurrency market. As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.23, reflecting a 1.6% loss on the daily chart and an 8% decline over the past week. Notably, XRP has recorded returns of over 285% in 2024, outperforming Bitcoin’s 115% gain. XRP YTD price chart. Source: Finbold From a technical perspective, Dark Defender’s analysis, shared in an X post on December 21, indicated that XRP appears to be repeating a familiar pattern observed on its four-hour chart, but this time on the daily timeframe, signaling a potentially explosive move ahead. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Dark Defender In the past, XRP dropped 21% to $1.0033 before rallying from $1.2680 to $2.9070. The current daily structure mirrors this, with a 34% dip to $1.9010. If XRP breaks above $2.90, targets of $5.85 and $8.76 could follow. Solana (SOL) The AI tool selected the decentralized finance asset Solana ( SOL ) as the second altcoin likely to outperform Bitcoin. ChatGPT-4o cited Solana’s strong fundamentals, such as high speed and low transaction costs, which have the potential to attract more users to the platform. With a stronger developer activity and a growing ecosystem, Solana is set to benefit as more projects are built on its network. This aligns with an Electric Capital report that showed Solana surpassed Ethereum ( ETH ) in new developer growth for the first time since 2016. In 2024, Solana led the blockchain ecosystem with an 83% year-on-year increase in new developers.

In an X post on December 21, Martinez observed that the range between $188 and $179 is a critical support level that previously acted as resistance from March to November. This area now serves as a potential launchpad for the next move. SOL price analysis chart.

Meanwhile, the Stochastic RSI is in oversold territory, suggesting SOL could be primed for a reversal. Despite XRP and Solana’s potential to outperform, their price movements will likely follow Bitcoin’s lead. While both altcoins have strong fundamentals and catalysts, Bitcoin’s performance will remain the primary force shaping the broader crypto market.

The New York-based firm recently filed for a new series of leveraged ETFs designed to tap into the world of crypto-focused companies. These funds aim to cater to bullish and bearish investors, amplifying daily returns through their innovative 2x long and 2x short structures. Crypto’s Heavyweights Under the GraniteShares ETF Spotlight At the heart of these new ETFs are some of the most influential companies in the crypto space. These ETFs include Riot Platforms , Marathon Digital, MicroStrategy, and Robinhood. Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital stand out as powerhouses in Bitcoin mining, boasting substantial Bitcoin reserves of 17,429 and 44,394 units, respectively. MicroStrategy leads the pack with an unmatched 439,000 Bitcoin holdings. While Robinhood continues to serve as a popular gateway for retail investors exploring stocks and cryptocurrencies. Leveraged ETFs: High Rewards, High Risks GraniteShares’ new funds are set to offer both 2x long and 2x short options. This means investors can double daily gains when stocks rise and amplify losses if they fall. For example, if Riot Platforms’ stock increases by 1%, the GraniteShares 2x Long RIOT ETF would rise by 2%. Conversely, a 1% drop in stock price leads to a 2% loss in the 2x short fund. This high-reward, high-risk approach has attracted attention, especially with the surge in crypto and stock markets this year. Leveraged ETFs like T-Rex 2x Long MSTR Daily Target fund (MSTU) and Defiance 2x Long MSTR ETF (MSTX) have outperformed expectations. They have raked in 308% and 253% returns, compared to a 150% rise in MicroStrategy’s stock over the past three months . However, when markets turn bearish, the losses can be substantial. In the last 30 days, MicroStrategy’s stock dropped by 24%, while MSTU and MSTX fell by over 50%. Historical data highlights the risks of leveraged funds. In 2022, the ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF, a 3x leveraged Nasdaq 100 tracker, plummeted by 79%. This sharp decline came as the index itself dropped by 32%. A Competitive Crypto ETF Landscape GraniteShares is entering an increasingly competitive ETF market. Unlike traditional funds, GraniteShares’ ETFs are designed for investors seeking to capitalize on short-term trends rather than long-term holds. These ETFs fit well with the risky and unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Leveraged ETFs are just one part of the trend as firms explore new crypto-focused financial products. Companies like YieldMax have taken a different approach by launching covered call ETFs. These funds invest in stocks and sell call options to generate monthly income for investors. Products like MARA Option Income ETF and Coin Option Income ETF have gained popularity by providing stability in the volatile crypto market.

The charges come as the FBI reports Americans lost over $5.6 billion to crypto fraud in 2023 — a 45% increase from the previous year. According to ABC News , citing prosecutors, Beverly Hills-based Hay and Thousand Oaks-based Mayo allegedly executed multiple “rugpull” schemes between May 2021 and May 2024. They also allegedly created NFT projects to attract investors before abandoning them while keeping the funds. You might also like: SEND surges 360%, dForce jumps 160%, BTC struggles to reclaim $100k The U.S. Attorney’s Office has charged both individuals with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, two counts of wire fraud, and one count of stalking. Each fraud count carries a potential 20-year prison sentence, with the stalking charge adding a possible additional five years. The pair, both 23 years-old, allegedly promoted several fraudulent projects, including the “Vault of Gems NFT,” collecting millions from investors before abandoning the ventures. The indictment details their attempts to hide their involvement by falsely attributing project ownership to others. Prosecutors also allege the defendants started a harassment campaign targeting the manager and their family. The case is a part of a broader trend in cryptocurrency crime, with the FBI reporting that while crypto-related crimes represent only 10% of financial fraud complaints, they account for nearly half of all financial losses Americans suffered to scams in 2023. Investment schemes, similar to those allegedly carried out by Hay and Mayo, caused the highest losses at $4 billion nationwide.

On Dec. 21, Trust Wallet users took to social media to report issues with their crypto balances vanishing. One X user mentioned that their balance would occasionally appear and disappear, while another user said they nearly had a heart attack upon seeing their balance vanish. At 6:45 am UTC, Trust Wallet acknowledged the issue, noting it initially affected BNB and Trust Wallet Token (TWT) balances. The company later confirmed that other tokens were also impacted. Despite the glitch, Trust Wallet reassured its users that their funds were secure. By 8:05 am UTC, the company announced that the issue had been resolved. “Hey Trust Fam, no more glitches! The issue has been resolved and everything should be working properly now. Thanks for your understanding,” the company wrote. While the incident was a technical error, it caused panic among some users. One X user feared their wallet had been drained, a reaction likely influenced by the prevalence of security breaches in the crypto space.

37971111,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666228,1734885032,"Ethereum Dips Below $3,100 – New All-Time High Possible Before 2025?","Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, recently experienced a significant price correction, dropping below $3,100 for the first time in 29 days. This marks a notable shift from its peak performance in December, when it reached this year’s high of $4,106 on December 16. However, the all-time high for ETH, set at $4,877 on November 8, 2021, remains unbroken. Since reaching that high, Ethereum has been forming lower highs and lower lows, indicating bearish momentum in the market. Ethereum Market Sentiment And Support Levels The year 2024 has been tumultuous for Ethereum, with a blend of bullish catalysts and market downturns. Early in the year, Ethereum saw a 47% increase, although it lagged behind Bitcoin’s substantial gains. A key driver of optimism was the SEC’s approval of Ethereum spot ETFs in May, which not only attracted institutional investors but also contributed to a 24.7% return for that month. However, geopolitical tensions and broader market dynamics, including the Bitcoin halving, led to volatile periods, with April witnessing a 17.2% decline in ETH’s value. Despite these fluctuations, Ethereum has maintained its stronghold in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, with its Total Value Locked approaching $80 billion, underscoring its fundamental strength. However, the second quarter was less favorable, with ETH posting a -5.08% quarterly return due to external factors like the Middle East crisis. Related Reading: Sentiment For Ethereum Hits 1-year Low, Analyst Says A Massive Run Is Coming As December 2024 unfolds, Ethereum was trading at around $3,648, showing signs of recovery in the last month of the year and outperforming other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana. However, the recent dip below $3,100 has sparked discussions about the potential for further declines or a swift recovery to new highs. Market sentiment, as indicated by the Fear and Greed Index at 57 (greed), suggests that retail investors see the current dip as a buying opportunity rather than a reason for panic selling. This sentiment is crucial as Ethereum navigates through its support levels, with the immediate one at $2,900 being a focal point. If Bitcoin experiences a significant drop to around $90,000, it could further influence ETH’s price, potentially pushing it towards its next significant support at $2,900. Related Reading: 7.8M Ethereum Leaves Binance In Two Months—What Does This Mean for ETH? Can Ethereum Hit A New All-Time High Before 2025? Looking towards the possibility of hitting a new all-time high before 2025, several factors come into play: Institutional Adoption: The ongoing investment from institutional players, especially through ETFs, could lead to increased demand. Network Upgrades: Upcoming Ethereum upgrades and improvements in scalability could enhance investor confidence. Market Sentiment: The crypto market’s general mood, influenced by broader economic conditions, technological advancements, and regulatory news, will be pivotal. The concentration of Ethereum holdings also plays a role. The Beacon Chain Deposit Contract holds over 38 million ETH, crucial for Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake. Other significant holders include exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, which could influence market liquidity and price movements through their strategic asset management. In conclusion, while Ethereum’s dip below $3,100 signals a moment of caution, the underlying fundamentals and market dynamics suggest there’s still a pathway to new highs before 2025. However, this would require positive developments in both the crypto-specific and broader economic landscapes. Investors should watch closely how Ethereum interacts with its support levels and responds to upcoming market catalysts.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has retreated to $97,000 from the all-time high of $108,427 after the Federal Reserve pointed to just two interest rate cuts in 2025. MVRV score shows Bitcoin price is still cheap The recent Bitcoin pullback affected investors, as evidenced by spot ETF flows. According to SoSoValue , these funds had net outflows of $276 million on Friday, a day after they shed $680 million in assets. That was a sign that some investors believe that Bitcoin may have topped. Still, the Market Value to Realized Value indicator hints that Bitcoin price is still cheap even after moving to a record high last week. According to CoinGlass, the MVRV-Z score has dropped to 2.84 from last week’s high of 3.3. Historically, an MVRV-Z score figure below 3.7 is a sign that an asset is undervalued. Bitcoin MVRV indicator | Source: Coinglass The MVRV-Z score is an important indicator that looks at the market value and the relative value of a coin. It is calculated by subtracting the realized market capitalization from the circulation market value and then dividing the figure by the standard deviation. Bitcoin had an MVRV score of 3.03 in the last big correction in March this year, and 7 in the previous major correction in January 2021. Therefore, this score is a sign that the coin could recover strongly in the next few weeks. As we wrote in a recent BTC forecast , the cup and handle pattern points to a rally to $122,000 in this bullish cycle.

As shown below, the number of Bitcoins in circulation has dropped to a multi-year low of 2.24 million. There were over 2.72 million coins in exchanges in September this year. That indicates that more investors are buying and storing Bitcoins in self-custody wallets. Some of these investors are those accumulating ETFs, which now have over $109 billion in assets. Companies like Marathon Digital and MicroStrategy have also continued to accumulate Bitcoins this year. MicroStrategy now holds over 439,000 coins. Bitcoin balances on exchanges | Source: CoinGlass The other potential catalyst for Bitcoin is that the stablecoin market cap has jumped to almost $210 billion, up from $122 billion a year earlier. A rise in stablecoin value is usually a positive indication, underscoring how more investors are showing interest in cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s annual inflation rate has continued falling, moving to 1.12% from the 2015 high of almost 12%. This inflation rate has fallen because of the halving events and the rising mining difficulty rate.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Still, there are plenty of trends to track. Here are some of the top cryptocurrencies to watch this week. Hyperliquid price rally gains steam Hyperliquid ( HYPE ), which airdropped on Nov. 29, surged to a record high this week. On Sunday, it hit a high of $35.18, up from the airdrop listing price of $11, bringing its cumulative gains to almost 200%. Its market cap has jumped to $9.2 billion, and its fully diluted valuation to $33.7 billion. Hyperliquid’s performance is likely because of its strong market share in the decentralized perpetual trading industry. Data compiled by DeFi Llama shows that Hyperliquid handled perpetual futures volume of $52 billion in the last seven days. Jupiter, the second-biggest player in the industry, had a volume of $8.7 billion, while SynFutures processed $6 billion. Hyperliquid’s total value locked in its DeFi ecosystem also peaked at $3.4 billion, up from $188 million in October. Technically, HYPE price needs to rise above $34.8 to confirm the bullish breakout. This price is both its all-time high and the upper side of the ascending triangle pattern. A move above that level will point to more gains — possibly to $40.

Horizen surges to 2022 highs Horizen ( ZEN ) price will be in the spotlight this week as the privacy-focused tokens continues soaring. It has risen in the last four consecutive days and surged to its highest level since May 2022. ZEN token jumped because Grayscale launched a Horizen Trust, which will give investors access to the coin. It was also listed on Gains Network, a decentralized derivatives trading platform built on the Polygon network. Investors cheered its final halving event on Dec. 12. Technicals point to more Horizen price gains since it formed a strong bottom at $6.30. It has risen above the important resistance level at $18, its highest swing on March 11. More gains could see it rise to the 23.6% retracement level at $45, which is 53% above the current level.

Immutable X price drops ahead of token unlock The third coin on this week’s list of top cryptocurrencies is Immutable X ( IMX ). The token’s price has suffered a harsh reversal and moved to its lowest level since Nov. 21. Immutable, a blockchain company based in Sydney, Australia, will be in the spotlight this week as the network unlocks over 24.5 million IMX tokens valued at over $33 million. These unlocks are part of Immutable’s tokenomics, which sees a similar number of coins released in the market each month. Immutable now has 1.69 billion IMX tokens in circulation against a supply cap of 2 billion. According to CoinMarketCap , the final unlock will happen in November 2025. The IMX token, the Ethereum Layer 2 solution for NFTs and gaming, has retreated below the major S&R pivot point of the Murrey Math Lines at $1.5625. It is now approaching the ultimate support at $1.1720, which coincides with the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swing since August. Therefore, odds are that the coin will continue falling ahead of the unlock event on Dec. 27.

37969779,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396219,1734882338,UAE Holding $40 Billion Worth Bitcoin? Truth or Rumor?,"The post UAE Holding $40 Billion Worth Bitcoin? Truth or Rumor? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Recent chatter in the crypto world has revolved around a bold claim that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) recently witnessed its Bitcoin holdings reach an impressive $40 billion. Perhaps prominent crypto commentator Bitcoin Archive raises questions over this news citing the lack of evidence supporting this bold news. Did the UAE’s Bitcoin holdings truly surge to $40 billion, or is it just a rumor? let’s find it out. UAE Bitcoin Holdings Reach $40 Billion The UAE’s Bitcoin holdings have reportedly reached $40 billion, showcasing its growing interest in cryptocurrencies. This surge aligns with a global crypto bull market and reflects the UAE’s focus on fostering a crypto-friendly environment. Initiatives like the cryptocurrency center in Dubai have supported blockchain startups, boosting Bitcoin reserves in the country. Experts believe the UAE will continue expanding its Bitcoin holdings, setting an example for other nations and encouraging institutional investments in Bitcoin. However, earlier Binance’s Former CEO CZ hinted that UAE secretly is increasing its bitcoin reserve. No Evidence to Support the Claim Bitcoin Archive recently pointed out the news provided by Bitcoinist about the United Arab Emirates (UAE) bitcoin holding. However, the Bitcoin Archive says they didn’t provide any credible sources, links, or supporting evidence to validate the $40 billion Bitcoin acquisition. The ""Bitcoinist"" website picked it up and stated it as a fact. No sources cited, no links, nothing. Search results return nothing. This would be HUGE news that is widely reported, especially in light on the USA Strategic Reserve commitment by Trump. The headlines make absurd… pic.twitter.com/RUKBsTinzp — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) December 22, 2024 After searching for trustworthy information, the Bitcoin Archive found no confirmation of such a purchase. They explained that a move as big as this would make global headlines, especially since the UAE has a major impact on the crypto market. They also mentioned the ongoing discussion about Bitcoin’s role in financial reserves, such as former President Trump’s idea of a U.S. Strategic Reserve. Questions About the News Bitcoin Archive also criticized the article on “Bitcoinist.” They noted that it had a flashy headline but lacked any credible details. The author of the piece also did not provide any background information, which further raised doubts about the report’s authenticity. UAE’s Growing Bitcoin Boom Between 2023 to June 2024, the UAE saw a massive $34 billion flow into cryptocurrencies, marking a 42% jump from the previous year. Bitcoin has emerged as a key player, holding 19% of the market share, while stablecoins like Tether make up 51%. Tether even plans to launch a dirham-backed token , showing the UAE’s focus on digital assets. By 2025, crypto users in the UAE are expected to reach 3.78 million. A report also shows that 72% of UAE residents had invested in Bitcoin by early 2024, with big funds and institutions driving this growth.

Here's What The Experts Think,"Layer-1’s are arguably the best risk-to-reward plays in the entire cryptocurrency space. Binance Coin, emerging as a major winner in the 2021 bull run, is still a top five layer-1 despite increasing competition. Here’s why Binance Coin will likely remain a top ten asset by the end of the 2025 bull run. Investors In Binance Coin Can Expect Bullish Long-Term And Short-Term Price Action Binance Coin is positioning itself for a major breakout as the crypto market surges, with BNB trading at $712 following a steady climb past the $700 psychological mark. The recent recovery in Bitcoin, which hit a new all-time high weekly close around $107,000, has sparked increased buying pressure across the market, providing favorable conditions for Binance Coin to test key resistance levels as altcoin season looms on the horizon. Binance Coin’s steady growth remains a testament to the strength of its ecosystem, thriving despite its lack of hype on social media and the legal woes of CZ this year. Unlike many of its rivals, Binance Smart Chain benefits from deep liquidity, an expansive DeFi network, and its ties to Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. This competitive advantage has allowed Binance Coin to sustain strong demand even as alternative layer-1 blockchains see fluctuating performances such as Toncoin. Recent rallies also highlight its resilience amid market volatility. The coin has maintained its upward momentum despite previous bearish signals, holding steady at the support level around $720. If Binance Coin can successfully break past its previous all-time high of $794, it would signal renewed investor confidence and further solidify Binance Coin's role as a leading layer-1 token in its second sequential bull cycle after dominating in the notorious 2021 run. However, traders remain cautious of potential short-term pullbacks, which are currently rife within the market as Bitcoin dominance continues to suppress the price action of altcoins like Binance Coin. Despite this risk, Binance Coin’s long-term outlook remains positive, bolstered by its dominant position in the layer-1 space, ongoing development of the Binance Smart Chain, and continued investor confidence. As the bull market intensifies upon an ever-encroaching alt-coin season, Binance Coin appears well-positioned to reclaim its spot among top-performing layer-1 tokens and set new price milestones despite rampant competition from the likes of Tron, Sui, Cardano, and Kaspa.

37969393,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313808,1734881438,Fundstrat’s Tom Lee Says Recent Market Dip an Opportunity for Investors – Here’s Why,"Veteran investor Tom Lee says investors are better off remaining bullish on markets despite the recent correction in equities and other risk assets. In a new interview on CNBC, Fundstrat’s head of research says that the correction in equities – which saw the S&P 500 dip from above 6,000 to 5,832 – is likely an opportunity for investors to go long rather than stay cautious. “This is another buying opportunity in our view. 2024 has proven to be a year where the market’s been strong and it has eluded many opportunities for sustained weakness. I know [December 18th’s] pullback was really painful, but to us, I think the fundamental supporting stocks are intact and I think it’s a good opportunity for investors here.” Lee notes that the volatility index (VIX) – which measures the stock market’s expectation of volatility based on S&P 500 index options – rose sharply on December 18th. He says that historically, such a rapid rise has correlated with market bottoms. “The market has been bleeding lower. If you look at internals for the last ten days, [December 18th] looks capitulatory because not only did we have a 90% down day, but the VIX exploded by 75%. There are only four times in history where it’s risen 60% in a day, so [December 18th] was the fifth time in its 35-year history. Of those four times, the market recovered all of its losses within a week three out of the four times. The fourth time it took a month. So I think what you had was people panicking to get out of a momentum trade that’s ending because we’re so close to year-end. But here’s the interesting thing. The forward VIX-futures curve barely moved. So it was almost as if people were seeking protection through the VIX on [December 18th].” As of Friday’s close, the S&P 500 traded at 5,930 points.

He had $5,000 saved for a new car but instead, he chose to invest in Solana (SOL), a blockchain project that many had never heard of. At the time, SOL was priced at just $0.70 per coin, making it an unconventional and high-risk choice. However, the roofer was realistic—his body wouldn’t sustain the demands of manual labor forever, and the COVID-19 pandemic offered the perfect moment to research new opportunities. Just over a year later, that decision paid off in ways he couldn’t have imagined. As SOL reached an all-time high of $249.97, his $5,000 investment transformed into $1.79 million! Today, many traders see BlockDAG (BDAG) as the next big opportunity, with its potential to deliver similar life-changing returns. How a Roofer’s Solana Investment Changed Everything When the Arizona-based roofer Jacob Blackwell first discovered Solana, it was by accident — he was stuck in the house due to the lockdown in the Covid pandemic when he stumbled across the crypto by chance. The project was relatively unknown, and its focus on high-speed, low-cost transactions hadn’t yet gained traction. But after hours of research down the rabbit hole, he recognized its potential to influence the blockchain. Armed with this knowledge, he invested his $5,000 savings and purchased 7,143 SOL tokens. For months, the price of SOL remained modest. Yet, the roofer held onto his investment, confident in the project’s long-term potential. By late 2021, his patience was rewarded when Solana surged to an all-time high of $249.97 per coin. His initial $5,000 had transformed into $1.79 million, opening the door to a new chapter in his life. This windfall allowed him to buy the boat he had dreamed of in his 20s and start traveling. More importantly, it gave him the financial freedom to leave the physically demanding roofing industry and embrace a stable, fulfilling lifestyle. Analysts Predict BlockDAG Will Be Next Millionaire-Maker Fast forward to today, and BlockDAG is drawing comparisons to Solana’s early days. While Solana tackled blockchain speed and efficiency, BlockDAG is solving scalability on an even greater scale. Its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology enables simultaneous transaction processing, eliminating bottlenecks and minimizing fees. This revolutionary approach positions BlockDAG as a blockchain designed for mass adoption. For traders considering BlockDAG, the potential returns are staggering. A $5,000 buy-in at BlockDAG’s current crypto presale price of $0.0234 in batch 26 would yield 213,675 BDAG coins. Analysts are projecting that the BDAG coin could hit $20 by 2027, which can turn this $5000 stake into a whopping $4.2 million — an incredible 84,000% ROI! For those who missed out on Solana’s rise, BlockDAG offers a second chance at life-altering returns. A Community-Focused Project Beyond its scalable technology, BlockDAG is also known for its commitment to its community. The platform continues to foster trust and momentum among its supporters. BlockDAG’s consistent AMA sessions and keynotes ensure the community stays informed about developments, including its successful Testnet launch and ongoing Mainnet audit, highlighting the project’s transparency and dedication to progress. BlockDAG’s ecosystem is designed to empower users of all backgrounds, from developers building decentralized applications to traders seeking financial independence. Celebrating milestones is a hallmark of its ecosystem, with rewards like the BDAG250 tiered bonus system offering escalating incentives. Its focus on accessibility and scalability ensures that BlockDAG isn’t just a blockchain for the few, it’s a blockchain for everyone. BlockDAG Is Set To Explode! The roofer’s story is a powerful reminder of the transformative potential of early crypto investments. His $5,000 bet on Solana didn’t just grow his wealth, it gave him the freedom to leave behind a life of physical labor and embrace new possibilities. Today, BlockDAG offers a similar opportunity for those ready to act. BlockDAG’s ingenious technology, strong community support, and unmatched scalability position it as the next major success story in the crypto world. At its current presale price and the potential for massive returns, now is the time for buyers to get in to make big returns.

37969443,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631949,1734881317,Patricia reportedly begins customer repayment plan after 2023 cyber attack,"Nigerian crypto trading platform Patricia Technologies has reportedly commenced repaying user funds following an attack on its platform. The development is another step in the right direction to restore customer faith following the platform’s security breach in 2022. In the breach, the platform lost over 600 million naira in user funds to the bad actors. According to reports , Patricia requested a window of about two to five years to enable it to generate income from operations. In addition, the platform is still coordinating efforts with law enforcement to recoup some of the stolen funds. After the breach, the platform paused operations, halting withdrawals to file a petition with the police regarding the theft on the platform. Reimbursement efforts announced via CEO’s social media The announcement of a repayment plan on the private account of Patricia’s CEO and founder, Hanu Fejiro Agbodje, may be an attempt to demonstrate to its users that it is still a trustworthy entity. The post claims that the repayment plan is already ongoing and that platform users will receive their funds in batches, meaning it could take a while before all the creditors are satisfied. Users are also advised to watch out for updates from official channels and update their details on the crypto platform. Patricia has taken steps to assure its customers of the prompt return of their funds. While investigations are still ongoing, the platform announced the conversion of user funds to its native Patricia token (PTK). The platform promised users that the token would be pegged against USDT, promising repayment in the future. During the period, Patricia mentioned that the token isn’t on-chain but will function as an internal token before it starts repayment. Patricia also made efforts to satisfy aggrieved users when it announced the delisting of DLM Trust as an escrow for repayments. However, DLM Trust came out to address the delisting, noting that it was due to disagreements between both parties. Police apprehend politician in connection to the theft According to reports, the police uncovered a lead in the case that led to the arrest of three people, including a politician, Wilfred Bonse, in November 2023. In a statement by police spokesperson Olumuyiwa Adejobi, Bonse provided help to the hackers, enabling them to launder about 50 million in stolen funds from the platform. Bonse received some of the funds in his account, information that was made available to the authorities. Adejobi mentioned that the lead provided them with enough materials to crack the case wide open. While Bonse and others were apprehended, the police spokesperson mentioned that the force was still doing all in its power to apprehend the others still at large. The Patricia platform hack underscores one of the ills in the crypto industry. While crypto exchanges need to do more about the security of their platforms, users are advised to keep their tokens safe by any means possible. One of the most used methods is through the use of offline wallets, which would provide guaranteed security. Users also need to keep their seed phrases safe from third parties, as exposing them could cause problems.

37969377,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52880,1734881053,Crypto Whales Are Gobbling Up These 2 Ethereum (ETH) Rivals This December. Do They Know Something?,"Ethereum remains the third largest crypto by market cap, and its ETF has been a key achievement this year. However, large investors are beginning to shift their attention from the king of altcoins to other alternatives — Rexas Finance and Dogecoin. Recently, these whales have bought notable quantities of these altcoins. But what is fueling this surprising interest? Is there something they know that we are missing out on? In this article, we’ll discuss these cryptocurrencies that are catching their attention and explain why Rexas Finance (RXS) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are great investments with massive returns. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Future Contender In The Crypto Market Rexas Finance (RXS) makes it easy for anyone to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs). Rexas Finance turns assets like real estate, fine art, and intellectual property into tokens. This approach opens up investment opportunities that were once limited to large institutions, increasing liquidity and enabling a broader global reach. Using blockchain technology, Rexas Finance makes managing assets more efficient and inclusive. As blockchain grows in adoption, Rexas is well-positioned to tap into new markets where Ripple’s utility falls short. Rexas Finance’s presale success shows strong investor support. Now in its 10th stage, the project has sold 350 million tokens at $0.150 each. Rexas runs exciting campaigns like the Millionaire Giveaway to further engage its community, which offers winners $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. These strategies build optimism and highlight the project’s potential to deliver significant returns—up to ten times higher than Ethereum’s. Rexas Finance stands out with innovative tools like the Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot, which make tokenizing assets quick and secure. The QuickMint Bot even lets you handle tokenization directly from your smartphone or computer. Additionally, Rexas offers advanced features such as the Rexas AI Shield for smart contract security and Rexas DeFi, its decentralized finance platform. This focus on innovation and versatility sets it apart from Ripple’s narrower emphasis on payment solutions, giving Rexas the potential to scale across various industries. Rexas Finance is already gaining traction, with listings on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. It plans to debut on major exchanges by 2025 at an expected price of $0.20. Analysts predict its value could surge to $18, which is 90x its launch price. This makes it an attractive option for investors seeking sustainable growth over speculative gains. With its focus on innovation, security, and accessibility, Rexas Finance is poised to lead the next crypto bull run. DogeCoin (DOGE): Repeating Historical Surge Pattern Dogecoin is gaining momentum in the cryptocurrency world and could even rival Ethereum. Its technical signals, like the MACD, show more people are interested in buying, which hints at a possible price increase. After a period of consolidation, Dogecoin is ready to rise and hit $0.50 or more. Many big whales are accumulating DOGE because they are confident in how much the coin will surge and yield massive investments for them. Big investors are showing confidence in DOGE. Wallets with over 1 million DOGE now own over 130 billion tokens, breaking previous records. This pattern is similar to what happened before DOGE’s massive 2021 rally, suggesting that whales are positioning themselves for another price surge. Several signs and technical patterns suggest that a rally could be on the horizon for the coin. Technical indicators like its Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) point to growing buying pressure and a possible end to the current dip in price. Some analysts, like Trader Tardigrade, note that DOGE has been forming a higher low, a sign of a potential breakout. If its higher low trend continues, Dogecoin could reach around $0.50 soon, with even higher gains likely in the longer term. Analysts suggest that DOGE is exhibiting a pattern similar to its price surge in 2027 and 2021. The coin stayed steady for a while before suddenly shooting up. With DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) now showing that it is overbought, the price might rise even more soon. Currently trading around $0.40, experts believe Dogecoin’s popularity among large investors and improving market conditions might lead to a big rally. Many agree that the coin’s strong signals and outside support make this an exciting time for its future. Conclusion Rexas Finance and Dogecoin have caught whales’ attention as they have left Ethereum and are buying these altcoins on a spree. Although Dogecoin is well known, Rexas Finance is a new crypto that has gained whales’ confidence. Its token launch is drawing near, making now a perfect opportunity to buy before its price rockets.

BTFD Coin: The New Meme King That’s Already Raised Over $4.2 Million BTFD Coin—or “Buy the F***ing Dip” for those in the know—has burst onto the crypto scene with the energy of a turbocharged meme rocket. Its presale is already making waves , smashing through $4.2 million in just its first month. With a total of 16 presale stages, BTFD Coin’s current price sits at $0.000013 in Stage 12, with its final listing price set at $0.0006. That’s a jaw-dropping leap for those who got in early, and analysts predict even more gains once it hits exchanges. So, what’s driving the hype? For starters, BTFD isn’t just a meme; it’s got substance. Its P2E game combines entertainment with crypto rewards, giving players a chance to earn while they play. Add in a generous referral program and staking options, and you’ve got a platform that’s built to engage and reward its community. And let’s not forget its strong “Buy the Dip” philosophy—a rallying cry for every investor who knows the value of jumping in during market chaos. To see how much you could earn, consider this: an investment of $35,000 in Stage 12 at $0.000013 per coin would snag you approximately 2.69 billion BTFD Coins. When the price hits $0.0006, your investment skyrockets to a value of $1.61 million. That’s life-changing money, mate. With over 57 billion coins sold to 6,100 holders already, this is one train you don’t want to miss. Memecoin (MEME): The Viral Icon With Staking and Swapping Power MEME’s not just a coin; it’s a movement. Born out of internet culture, MEME has mastered the art of virality, and its ever-growing community is proof that memes really do make the world go round. While other meme coins fizzle out, MEME has carved its niche with robust staking and swapping features that keep investors hooked. MEME’s latest innovation is MemeSwap, a staking platform offering flexible APR rates that adjust based on demand. Whether you’re locking in for the long haul or just testing the waters, MEME’s one-click harvesting and rewards system—which includes MEME and MUSDT tokens—makes it ridiculously easy to rake in profits. And with plans to expand its staking pools, the project’s only getting stronger. What really sets MEME apart, though, is its insurance model. Yup, you read that right. MEME offers blockchain insurance to protect investors from rug pulls and sudden devaluation—a game-changer in a space that’s known for its risks. Combine that with its meme-worthy branding, and MEME is attracting both retail and institutional investors alike. Could MEME hit the same heights as Dogecoin or Shiba Inu? Its track record suggests it’s got the chops. As its community continues to grow, so does its potential to deliver those coveted 100x returns. If you’re looking for a meme coin with substance and staying power, MEME might just be your ticket. Turbo (TURBO): The Underdog With an Eco-Friendly Twist TURBO isn’t just another meme coin riding on hype; it’s got a mission. Designed to be energy-efficient, TURBO leverages cutting-edge blockchain tech to minimise its environmental impact. For eco-conscious investors, it’s a breath of fresh air in a market that’s often criticised for its carbon footprint. But TURBO’s appeal isn’t just about saving the planet. It’s also making waves with its utility. TURBO’s decentralised exchange, TurboDEX, allows for seamless trading with ultra-low fees. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a newbie looking to dip your toes, TurboDEX makes the process simple and cost-effective. Community engagement is another feather in TURBO’s cap. Its active presence on social media, combined with regular AMAs and giveaways, keeps its investors in the loop and excited about what’s coming next. It’s this kind of transparency and connection that’s earned TURBO a loyal following and a spot among the top meme coins with 100x potential. While it’s still early days for TURBO, its roadmap is packed with promising developments, including NFT integrations and expanded staking options. As these features roll out, TURBO’s value proposition is only set to grow, making it a compelling pick for those looking to diversify their meme coin portfolio. How to Unlock the BTFD Coin Bonus?

This guide highlights the top cryptos to buy, focusing on four standout projects with unique features and strong growth potential. From innovation to utility, these cryptocurrencies are shaping the future of blockchain technology. Here’s why BlockDAG, Toncoin, Aptos, and Avalanche are leading the way in 2025 and what makes them worthy additions to your portfolio. BlockDAG: Redefining Blockchain Scalability BlockDAG is setting new standards for blockchain efficiency by integrating Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology with Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus. This hybrid approach eliminates traditional scalability issues, making it an appealing choice for developers and users alike. Currently in its presale phase, BlockDAG has raised over $170 million, with BDAG coins priced at $0.0234. Early adopters have seen impressive returns of 2240%, highlighting the growing demand for this cutting-edge project. The BlockDAG mainnet is expected to launch in early 2025, promising faster and more decentralized transactions. The project’s bonus program, offering up to 170% additional tokens, is an added incentive for early participants. Analysts forecast BDAG to hit $1 by the end of 2025, with long-term predictions reaching $20 or more by 2027. These factors firmly position BlockDAG as the leader among the top cryptos to buy, thanks to its technological innovation and market momentum. Toncoin: Expanding Ecosystem and Utility Toncoin, the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, continues to gain traction due to its seamless integration with the Telegram ecosystem. With a current price of $6.15 and a recent 7% uptick, Toncoin is showing signs of a strong recovery. Its expanding utility in payments and smart contracts makes it a versatile option for blockchain users. Increased transaction volumes and new integrations are driving demand for TON. Developers are building on The Open Network, enhancing its appeal as a platform for decentralized applications. This combination of utility and adoption ensures Toncoin remains one of the top cryptos to buy as it moves into 2025 with a growing user base. Aptos: Innovating with the Move Programming Language Aptos stands out with its roots in the Facebook-initiated Diem project and its innovative Move programming language. Currently priced at $10.30, Aptos has experienced significant growth in 2024, with its total value locked (TVL) increasing by over 1,800%. This surge is fueled by native USDT liquidity and an expanding decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Leadership changes in December 2024 have positioned Aptos for a fresh phase of growth under its new CEO, Avery Ching. The platform’s ability to scale and its developer-friendly environment make it one of the top cryptos to buy, offering both innovation and a strong foundation for long-term success. Avalanche: Pioneering Blockchain Efficiency Avalanche is making waves with its Avalanche9000 upgrade, which reduces deployment costs for Layer-1 blockchains by 99.9%. This has drawn attention from developers and institutions seeking scalable solutions. Currently trading at $35.01, Avalanche has experienced a 167% rally, consolidating near its $48 resistance level. Recent increases in whale activity indicate growing confidence in AVAX’s potential. With targets set at $100 and beyond, Avalanche continues to be a reliable option among the top cryptos to buy in 2025, thanks to its efficient design and expanding ecosystem. The Final Take The cryptocurrency market offers diverse opportunities, but the key lies in identifying projects with strong fundamentals and growth potential. BlockDAG leads the pack with its innovative technology, while Toncoin, Aptos, and Avalanche offer compelling features and solid ecosystems. These top cryptos to buy in 2025 are shaping the future of blockchain, making them essential picks for anyone looking to stay ahead in the crypto market.

Monsta Mash has the potential to surpass most older coins due to its strong fundamentals, robust community support, and its use case in a fast-booming gaming sector. As projects like ADA and SUI promise possible double or triple returns at best, $MASH is forecasted to grow over 10X in the first year alone. Let us dive into the detailed performances of the three coins. Monsta Mash ($MASH) Performance The Cryptids-Monsta Mash is making waves in the GameFi arena presenting itself as the next industry giant. The platform combines Play-to-Earn and Tap-based gameplays pooling a long list of options to choose from. From pro gamers to industry newbies, all participants have something that suits their unique preferences. The first Tap-Based gameplay will launch this month allowing fans to enjoy the festivities in style. User-oriented development ensures easy maneuverability and transparent participation.

This version runs on smart devices including mobile phones and tablets. The second phase of the live presale is almost wrapping up. The initial token price of $0.0018 will increase to $0.00365 in phase three representing the first 100% growth. Early investors are waiting for similar incremental changes to grow their investment by a possible 1000% at the time of public listing. By late 2025, projections from the current price and expected game adoption puts the $MASH token price above $2. Take a chance, spring for the moon with $MASH $MASH tokens facilitate all the operations in the Monsta Mash gaming ecosystem . From game, upgrades, unlocking new levels and challenges, to the reward system. The further the platform reaches in the global gaming market the higher the demand and possibly the price of $MASH tokens. As gamers engage, investors watch as their money makes more money.

The Mash Yields platform allows $MASH holders to stake their tokens for annual returns of up to 19% APY. The community is awarded 10-day giveaways including 10 million $MASH tokens, $10,000 USDT, and new iPhones. Cardano (ADA) & Sui (SUI) Embarks On Fast Rebounds Cardano's price has shifted from $1.3 last week to a low of $0.77 on December 20. The price had dropped even lower prompting analysts to prophecy doom for investors. A popular market analyst Peter Brandt had predicted massive losses for ADA holders. In the last few hours, ADA price has declined by 15.31% to trade at $0.9171, volume is down 44.73%, and market cap has decreased by 5.76%. On-chain metrics show that the network growth and future market momentum are bullish. ADA is headed up and fast. SUI lost over 5.12% in less than 12 hours spiking its price from $4.72 to $4.56. Decreased market activity has led to a decline in its trading volume by 33.71%. Despite this price decline, analysts are optimistic that SUI is quickly approaching the $4.91 ATH set days ago. Sui network gained massive attention after a recent collaboration with Arkham aimed to promote seamless consumer data analytics. The partnership will also widen the utility and transparency of the Sui network. This and similar collaborations have elevated the long-term growth potential for SUI coin as its in-network demand increases. Conclusion The market is quickly exiting the red zone. SUI and ADA are among the fastest rebounding cryptos in the past 24 hours. Investors who purchased during the dip could make huge returns in the next few days. Monsta Mash($MASH) will likely join in on the celebration and sell fast in the next few days, wrapping up phase two. Investors are already looking at 2X growth with the new token price starting in phase three. Projections indicate that $MASH could outperform ADA and SUI in early 2025.

Although XRP and Litecoin promise a huge surge soon, investors are still shy to dive in due to pending uncertainties. Monsta Mash ($MASH) presents a unique investment option with low entry and revolutionary gains. Monsta Mash is curving its place in the GameFi world as a pioneer of hybrid P2E/T2E gaming.

PEPE: The Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on the Ethereum network, inspired by the early 2000s internet meme, Pepe the Frog. It seeks to emulate the success of memecoins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, featuring no transaction taxes and embracing a pure memecoin identity with no utility. In mid-2023, PEPE reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts and sparking a memecoin frenzy. Its roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. The coin incorporates a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders, supporting its stability. In the current market cycle, PEPE continues to attract interest due to its strong community and unique features. BONK: Community-Driven Memecoin Boosting Solana’s Ecosystem BONK is a Solana-based memecoin with a Shiba Inu mascot, aiming to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. It surged over 100% after a Coinbase listing and airdropped 50% of its supply to Solana’s NFT and DeFi participants. By mid-December 2023, BONK became the third-largest memecoin by market cap, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Its involvement in a growing ecosystem of decentralized apps, including BonkSwap, positions it as a notable player in cryptocurrency. Despite challenges like a high total supply, BONK’s impressive growth and integration make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Conclusion As the 2024 bull run unfolds, PEPE and BONK show less short-term potential. DOGEN, embodying luxury and success, is designed for those seeking the best in life. With expected 700% presale growth and potential thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows the path of successful tokens like WIF and Popcat, building a community of market leaders and offering real benefits to early adopters.

37968614,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375634,1734878949,Crypto Industry Lost $2.3B to Cyber Threats in 2024: Cyvers Report,"As 2024 gradually wraps up, the web3 security firm Cyvers has released a Security, Fraud, and Compliance Report for the year, detailing how much impact cybercriminals and their operations had on the crypto industry. According to an executive summary shared with CryptoPotato , in 2024, the crypto industry lost over $2.361 billion to cyber threats across 165 incidents. This figure represents a 40% increase from 2023, when losses totaled $1.69 billion. Access Control Incidents Lead to More Losses Cyvers noted that access control incidents accounted for 81% of losses in 2024 despite comprising 41.6% of incidents. This type of attack led to the theft of $1.9 billion across 67 incidents, while code vulnerabilities enabled the loss of roughly $456.3 million across 98 incidents. Meanwhile, address poisoning scams were fewer, and one incident accounted for the loss of $68.7 million. Although the fraud trends in 2024 marked a 40% increase in losses year-over-year, they are still 37% below the 2022 record of $3.78 billion. This year, Ethereum emerged as the network most affected by the attacks, with more than $1.2 billion in losses. Analyzing quarterly highlights, Cyvers found that smart contract vulnerabilities dominated most incidents in Q1 2024. The third quarter saw the highest losses, amounting to $790 million, while Q4 recorded the lowest activity and losses, with a 56% decline when compared to the same quarter in 2023. Notably, Q3 was dominant in both 2023 and 2024. The Most Notable Theft Incidents The $305 million hack against the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DMM Bitcoin was one of the largest incidents in 2024, followed by the $235 million hack against the Indian crypto exchange WazirX. The decentralized finance (DeFi) project Radiant Capital lost $50 million to cybercriminals after its devices were compromised. The Singaporean crypto exchange BingX was also exploited for $52 million in digital assets. Interestingly, 2024 saw a remarkable recovery rate, with more than $1.3 billion returned to affected projects, which was partially attributed to bug bounty programs. Next year, the industry could see a rise in new cyber threat trends like quantum and artificial intelligence attacks as these technologies continue to advance. There could also be more centralized finance (CeFi) targeting cases as CeFi entities remain vulnerable to heightened risks. Additionally, pig butchering scams also pose a growing threat as they accounted for $3.6 billion in victim funds across over 150,000 addresses and 800,000 transactions in 2024.

Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/daddy-pepe-daddpepe-solana-memecoin-to-explode-11000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37968271,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631938,1734877915,Google’s AI comeback restores investor confidence in its stock,"Google has flipped the script. After months of being dragged through the mud for losing its early advantage in artificial intelligence, the tech giant has returned with guns blazing. Its December rollout of new AI models and tools has sent investors into a frenzy, pushing Alphabet’s stock to a record $199.91 and a market cap of $2.3 trillion. The revival started with Gemini 2.0, Google’s advanced AI model that has crushed competitors in benchmarks. It is paired with other major releases like Project Mariner and Project Astra. Mariner can generate detailed research reports on command, while Astra answers real-time queries in text, video, and audio—heck, it even works through smart glasses. Google’s Veo 2 and Imagen 3 are seemingly redefining video and image generation, giving investors plenty of reasons to believe in the company’s resurgence. Advanced tech and hardware give Google a new edge One of the boldest decisions was introducing Trillium, Google’s new Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) chip to challenge Nvidia’s dominance in the AI hardware market. Then there’s Willow, Google’s quantum computing chip. It is designed to handle qubits, which are those tricky quantum bits that keep most quantum projects in limbo. The company also claims it can perform tasks in five minutes that would take conventional supercomputers 10 septillion years. However, quantum computing isn’t ready for prime time yet. And let’s not forget DeepMind. AlphaFold, the AI software that predicts protein structures, bagged a Nobel Prize for its creators, Sir Demis Hassabis and John Jumper. This tech surge comes as Google reports three consecutive quarters of double-digit profit growth. Numbers don’t lie. Investors have taken notice, driving the stock price up 38% this year. While the gains are impressive, there’s still a $1 trillion gap between Alphabet and Microsoft. The question isn’t whether Google is climbing—it’s whether it can overtake the leader. An uphill battle with c ompetitors, lawsuits, and Elon Musk The competition isn’t sitting still. Microsoft is still ahead, thanks to its early bet on OpenAI and the seamless integration of AI into its flagship products. Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, threw shade at Microsoft’s reliance on OpenAI’s models during the DealBook Summit . He said, “I would love to do a side-by-side comparison of Microsoft’s own models and our models any day, any time.” But it’s not just Microsoft. Elon Musk’s xAI is building something massive in Memphis. His Colossus supercomputer, powered by 100,000 Nvidia GPUs, is expected to scale up to one million chips. That kind of computing power isn’t just for show. Elon’s chatbot, Grok, might not be a direct threat yet, but with plans to catch up by 2025, Google can’t afford to get too comfortable. And then there’s Uncle Sam. The Department of Justice is gunning for Google in a big way. After losing an antitrust case in August, it is bracing for more blows. The DOJ wants to force the sale of Chrome, cancel Google’s exclusive deal with Apple, and open up its treasure trove of user data. AI-powered startups like Anthropic and OpenAI are also nipping at Google’s heels. These companies offer tools that skip the middleman, providing direct answers instead of links. Google’s response, “AI Overviews,” might sound clever, but early data shows a drop in ad clicks—down 8% year-on-year in Q3. That’s bad news for a company that relies on $175 billion in ad revenue. Internal struggles and slow execution Google’s challenges aren’t just external. The company’s own structure has been a problem. Competing teams delayed the launch of Gemini as they vied for internal attention. When Google finally unveiled Bard, it was a flop. Critics didn’t hold back, and Alphabet’s market value took a $100 billion hit in a single day when Bard flubbed a demo. Now Gemini 2.0 is finally here, and it’s a hit. But the journey has been messy. Google insiders blame fragmented leadership and a lack of urgency for the delays. Sundar Pichai admitted that ChatGPT’s popularity caught him off guard, saying at a Stanford event, “I had a different sense of the trajectory in mind.” While his confidence in the future of AI remains high, the missteps have left scars.

37967955,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26914,1734877500,Tai Mo Shan Settles with SEC for $123 Million Over TerraUSD Collapse,"Tai Mo Shan, a subsidiary of Jump Crypto, agreed to pay $123 million to settle charges with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Dec. 20 for misleading investors about the stability of the TerraUSD (UST) algorithmic stablecoin before its collapse. The SEC revealed that Tai Mo Shan had an agreement with Terraform Labs in 2021 to purchase Terra LUNA at a steep discount. Additionally, Tai Mo Shan bought approximately $20 million in UST to maintain the stablecoin’s 1:1 peg with the US dollar. SEC Chair Gary Gensler remarked: “The impact reverberated throughout the crypto markets, eventually costing the savings of countless investors. Regardless of the labels, crypto market participants should comply with the securities laws where applicable and not deceive the public.” The Collapse of TerraUSD TerraUSD, once the third-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, collapsed in May 2022, causing widespread disruption in the crypto market. It was an algorithmic stablecoin that maintained its dollar peg through software and digital asset collateral. The collapse began on May 8, 2022, when a whale dumped around $285 million in UST, causing the stablecoin to lose its peg and drop to $0.98. By May 10, UST plunged further to $0.67, triggering liquidations among leveraged traders and sparking fear and uncertainty among investors. As UST’s market capitalization exceeded the underlying LUNA reserves, it became clear that the stablecoin lacked sufficient collateral, leading to its complete collapse as panic selling ensued. The fallout prompted a formal investigation of Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, by U.S. authorities, resulting in charges and a $4.4 billion settlement. The collapse also spurred regulatory reforms like the Lummis-Gillibrand Stablecoin Act of 2024, which banned algorithmic stablecoins.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/tai-mo-shan-settles-with-sec-for-123-million-over-terrausd-collapse/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

These new rules will go into effect on January 15, 2025, in an effort to strengthen consumer protection and compliance with the UK’s financial regulations. This update affects ads for cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers, including hardware wallet providers, although there are restrictions to their services. FCA Registration Now Compulsory for UK Crypto Firms As part of the new policy, crypto firms are expected to be registered with the FCA before they can run an ad on Google’s platform. Affected by this are: Crypto Exchanges: Online marketplaces where users can buy, sell, and trade digital assets. Software Wallets: Programs that allow users to store and manage cryptocurrencies. Hardware Wallets: Tangible devices that store private keys for digital assets, as long as they do not provide ancillary services of trading or selling assets. On top of the FCA registration, advertisers must comply with local laws of the regions they are targeting to continue being eligible. Google’s Push for Safer Crypto Ads Google’s move reflects growing regulatory scrutiny worldwide. Recently, the FCA issued warnings over unauthorized crypto promotions , including a Solana-based memecoin project called “Retardio” that was targeting UK consumers. This was an effort to protect users from financial losses in relation to unregulated promotions. Crypto Ad Scams Continue to Infiltrate Despite Regulations Despite stricter policies, crypto scams continue to be a thorn in Google’s platform. Recent examples include: Fake Crypto Websites: A phishing ad, impersonating Sony’s blockchain project, Soneium, led users to a fake website that stole crypto assets. Fraudulent Wallet Apps: An app called WalletConnect siphoned $70,000 from users. While it impersonated a legitimate protocol, it was an advanced scam targeting mobile users only. These incidents are a reminder of the ongoing challenges in keeping the crypto space secure and the need for strict ad policies and user vigilance. Google’s new policy will be a step toward better monitoring of crypto ads, so it also aligns with the global effort to improve transparency and consumer protection in the crypto industry. As the year 2025 approaches, specifically in January, these will be changes that advertisers have to be prepared for.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/google-require-uk-ads-register-financial-regulator/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

37967291,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112709,1734876005,SOL Poised for Explosive Growth in 2025: Why This Blockchain Could Break All Records!,"SOL’s impressive run lately has raised its investors’ optimism for its growth trajectory leading into 2025. However, SOL is not the only project that has the potential to dominate the crypto market next year. The new 1Fuel is also showing signs that it will break records in terms of price and ecosystem functionality. While 1Fuel’s presale is already showing evidence of its projected growth potential, there’s a chance that it might even surpass expectations. Here’s why: Get the Maximum DeFi Trading Experience with 1Fuel There is no doubt that the DeFi market is a lot more advanced than it used to be when it first started. However, one part that hasn’t seen much progress is its interoperability. The main factor responsible for this problem is the complexity associated with the crypto wallet system. Although projects like Trust Wallet help investors manage their funds, there is still a lot of room for this process to become easier. This is where 1Fuel comes in. 1Fuel is a next-generation cross-chain crypto wallet platform that features a very unique one-click cross-chain transaction system. This system, combined with its interactive and intuitive user interface, ensures that newbies and old-timers have the best trading experience. 1Fuel also offers a ton of other features such as disposable wallets for short-term transactions, a built-in transaction mixer, and cold storage to keep assets secure and anonymous. But that’s not all; 1Fuel enhances its functionality further with a decentralized P2P exchange. This exchange is powered by verified smart contracts which ensure safe and direct trading for all 1Fuel users. All of 1Fuel’s features are powered by its native token called OFT. Due to its status as a utility token and its impressive tokenomics, OFT might just be the best crypto to buy now . Green Charts Ahead for Solana in 2025 SOL is one of the few crypto projects that has somehow managed to maintain a positive outlook all year. It has surged by over 190% which is a significant price rally by every standard in today’s market. Despite this growth, many SOL enthusiasts and analysts believe that there are still higher milestones for SOL to reach next year. One analyst in particular, Inmortal, recently grabbed attention with his bold SOL price prediction. In a recent X post, Inmortal claimed that SOL will hit $500 and won’t be stopped. He added that any dips are just distractions in this upward movement. The recent price charts for SOL support Inmortal’s assertion. Over the past month, SOL has been fluctuating between $210 and $230, indicating a strong consolidation phase. Moreover, Solana’s technical indicators also look bullish. TradingView data shows it is above its 50-day EMA ($213) and 100-day EMA ($192). If SOL can manage to break through the $250 resistance level before 2024 ends, reaching the $500 mark in 2025 will be a breeze for the token. Conclusion Ready to make the most of your trading journey in 2025? SOL and 1Fuel might be your best bets in terms of making profits. While SOL is likely going to continue on its upward momentum, 1Fuel is poised to redefine earning opportunities with its ongoing crypto presale. Stage 2 of this presale is currently live, featuring OFT tokens available for just $0.012 each. Don’t miss out on a chance to acquire what could be the best crypto to buy now . Invest in OFT today!

Real estate has emerged as a promising sector for blockchain innovation. Garlinghouse noted that Ripple’s technology is being tested for practical applications in global payments and title management, addressing long-standing inefficiencies. The use of XRP in these trials highlights its utility in facilitating secure and rapid transactions, especially in sectors where traditional methods are often slow and cumbersome.

37967197,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631925,1734875429,Starboard targets Riot Platforms’ inefficiencies in a plan to unlock billion-dollar growth,"Bitcoin mining giant Riot Platforms might be sitting on a goldmine—one it hasn’t fully tapped into yet. Starboard, one of the most aggressive activist investors in the US stock market, has taken a massive position in the company, and according to them, Riot could transform itself by moving focus to hyperscaler demand. Riot owns and operates huge Bitcoin mining facilities across central Texas and Kentucky and runs a robust electrical engineering division out of Denver. While the company holds 16,728 Bitcoins and boasts a mining infrastructure of over 1 gigawatt (GW) capacity, it has been underperforming in the stock market, apparently creating a compelling case for Starboard’s intervention. Riot’s performance in numbers—and why Starboard cares At $11.55 per share and a market valuation of $3.97 billion, Riot Platforms is no small fish. But this year has been rough. Bitcoin has surged by 130%, yet Riot’s stock dropped 24%, far behind competitors who’ve posted triple-digit gains. This underperformance points to serious issues in operations and leadership. Starboard isn’t known for sitting quietly when there’s potential to make a company profitable. With 155 activist campaigns under its belt and an average return of 23.27% on those campaigns, Starboard’s presence alone tells us that Riot might be forced into big changes. The numbers don’t lie. Riot spent $225 million on selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs this year—more than triple the $67 million it spent in 2022. Much of this expense comes from executives rewarding themselves with stock-based compensation, gobbling up 11.5%, 9.5%, and a ridiculous 32.12% of total revenue over the last three years. Despite this, Riot’s management has produced nothing but losses, with this year’s operating loss surging to $304 million, its worst ever. The company’s corporate governance is equally shaky. A staggered five-member board, instances of nepotism, and questionable leadership decisions have left Riot with the highest power cost and SG&A expense per Bitcoin mined. The result was a dirt-cheap valuation compared to industry peers based on metrics like enterprise value to petahash per second (EV/PH/s). Why Starboard thinks hyperscalers are a trillion-dollar opportunity Starboard is an investor, so it’s solely here to make money. Its plan for Riot is to get into the hyperscaler market. Hyperscalers are the giants of cloud computing—think Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud—who run massive data centers to support AI and high-performance computing (HPC). These companies are desperate for infrastructure, and Bitcoin mining facilities like Riot’s are a perfect match. Starboard pointed out that Riot already has the goods. Its Rockdale, Texas site is the largest Bitcoin mining facility in North America, with 700 MW of capacity. The Corsicana, Texas facility, set to hit 1 GW when completed, has 400 MW of capacity ready now. These facilities share key attributes with hyperscaler needs: high-performance computing infrastructure, renewable energy access, and scalability. Competitors have already seized this opportunity. Core Scientific, another Bitcoin miner, inked a deal with CoreWeave, an AI data center startup backed by Nvidia, to lease 500 MW of capacity. That deal is worth $8.7 billion over 12 years and delivers 75-80% profit margins—far better than the margins in Bitcoin mining. Core Scientific’s stock soared 40% the day after announcing the deal and is up 220% this year. Riot could rake in similar profits. Leasing the unused 600 MW at Corsicana could bring in $600 million annually, nearly doubling its current $313 million revenue. If Riot converted its entire 1.1 GW of capacity at Rockdale and Corsicana to hyperscaler use, those numbers could triple. Better yet, hyperscalers apparently often cover the cost of building or retrofitting these facilities. Companies like Hive Digital and Hut 8 are also making the change, with Bitcoin miners that have embraced hyperscalers posting an average year-to-date stock return of 105.8%. Riot, along with other laggards like Marathon Holdings and CleanSpark, sits at -3.4%. The math is simple: adapt or fall further behind. But Riot isn’t entirely blind to its options. The company recently spent $510 million buying Bitcoin on the open market, financed through convertible senior notes. This hints at a desire to hold more Bitcoin without expanding mining capacity. But Starboard’s plan offers a better route: use hyperscaler revenue to fund Bitcoin purchases, creating a cycle of cash flow and asset accumulation. A MicroStrategy of some sort.

Chainlink ( LINK ), the biggest oracle provider, bottomed at $20.12 on Friday and rebounded to $22.50 on Sunday, Dec. 22. Still, the coin remains about 27% from its highest point this month, meaning that it is in a bear market. A potential catalyst for the LINK token is that whales are accumulating it. According to LookOnChain, nine new wallets withdrew 362,380 coins from Binance in the last two days. These coins are now valued at over $8.19 million. Crypto.news reported last week that another whale accumulated 65,000 LINK coins valued at $1.8 million. Whales are accumulating $LINK !

It’s worth noting that President-elect Trump and his family mostly own WLFI tokens. Chainlink, known in the crypto industry for its fundamentals, is the biggest oracle in the sector with over $35 billion in total value secured. That figure is higher than its biggest competitors like Chronicle, Pyth, Edge, and Redstone. Chainlink’s ecosystem will likely grow as more chains and networks embrace its technology. Justin Sun’s Tron, the most recent chain to use its oracles, has switched from WINKLink to Chainlink . Chainlink has also formed major partnerships in the Real World Asset tokenization industry, including by companies like Coinbase, Emirates NBD, SWIFT, and UBS. Chainlink price formed a double-bottom pattern LINK, like other cryptocurrencies, has dropped sharply in the past few days as concerns about the Federal Reserve remained. The token has remained above the 50-day moving average on the daily chart. Most importantly, it has formed a double-bottom chart pattern at $20.12. This pattern happens when an asset fails to move below a specific price two times. It is one of the most bullish reversal patterns in the market. LINK has also formed an inverse hammer pattern, a popular reversal sign. Therefore, the coin is likely to bounce back in the next few days as investors target the key psychological at $30, which is about 35% above the current level. On the flip side, the bullish view will become invalid if the coin drops below the double-bottom point at $20.12.

He took to his handle on X (formerly Twitter) to ask if Ethereum would enjoy the same success as Bitcoin should a Saylor-like personality promote the token. The scenario Anthony Sassano teased is based on Saylor’s role in the push for Bitcoin adoption. Michael Saylor and his firm, Microstrategy have become the face of Bitcoin adoption, buying millions upon millions worth of the digital asset strategically. The company’s initiative has installed Bitcoin as a source of value and as a better hedge against inflation, reducing its appearance as a speculative asset. While Microstrategy and Saylor have been more steadfast than most, other entities have also been integral in promoting the asset. Ethereum advocate makes his case The ETH advocate’s question caused quite a stir on X. Several users dropped their takes, discussing at length the reason why the ETH space needs its own high-profile champion. A user noted that it would be incredible, noting that the influence of the person will really provide great help to Ethereum. I still think there is an absolutely massive opportunity for someone to become Ethereum's Saylor-like figure Just relentlessly buying ETH no matter the price and then shilling ETH (and Ethereum!) endlessly to mainstream audiences I wish I had the money to do this myself 😅 — sassal.eth/acc 🦇🔊 (@sassal0x) December 22, 2024 Another user claimed there could be a concentrated decentralized effort, noting that the action could see input from influencers, whales, and other users in the space. One mentioned that a centralized figure could help boost ETH’s price, using structured mechanics. The user suggested a model that will include bonding, token boosts, and borrowing mechanisms, noting that it could help accelerate the price of the token. One user talked about yield integration, noting that it could make the strategy very effective. Meanwhile, some users brought up examples of personalities that they felt could fill the gap. A user suggested Bit Digital CEO Samir Tabar, highlighting that his company mines Bitcoin to accumulate Ethereum, a move that has helped to promote ETH as a proxy. Others also proposed other candidates, with a user highlighting the influence that United States President-elect Donald Trump could have on the price of Ethereum. He mentioned that his pro-crypto stance could be pivotal in shaping the future of the asset. Challenges and the wider implications for Ethereum The initiative, however, didn’t go down well with others, with most of them highlighting the dangers of centralized influence. A user noted that Saylor’s present and growing influence might be detrimental to the asset, noting that he holds about 2% of the total Bitcoin supply. The user noted that the development could deter others from adopting the asset, noting that a central person for Ethereum could face the same criticism. Others also talked about how hard it is to create a company that will sustain the same hunger for Ethereum as the one Microstrategy has for Bitcoin. A user said Ethereum’s 75 million token during its pre-sale creates a unique dynamic that would discourage an entity from taking up a central role. One user also said there could be conflict of interest issues, noting that large holders or validators may not want to become a centralized figure to protect their positions within the network. In addition, other users talked about Ethereum ’s ecosystem and its unique characteristics. A user talked about the state of the network without a ‘champion’ like Saylor, suggesting that someone like Bankless could fill the role. Meanwhile, another user said the decentralized nature of the network makes it hard for it to rely on a central figure like Saylor for advocacy. The conversation also trickled into the relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a user highlighting Bitcoin’s 21 million cap makes it suitable for high-scale holding.

37966404,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666206,1734874243,Ethereum Accumulation Address Holdings Surge By 60% In Five Months – Details,"Amid a general crypto market price fall in the past week, Ethereum (ETH) recorded a price correction of over 19.5% finding support at a local bottom of $3,100. Since then, the prominent altcoin has only shown slight resilience rising by over 5% in the past two days. However, recent data on wallet activity provides much cause to be bullish on Ethereum’s long-term future. Related Reading: Ethereum Rejected At $4,000 Resistance Again: What Lies Ahead For ETH? Ethereum HODL Addresses Increase Supply Dominance To 16% In a recent QuickTake post, CryptoQuant analyst MAC_D shared some positive insights on the Ethereum market. The crypto market expert reports that the balance of Ethereum Accumulation Addresses has surged by a remarkable 60% from August to December. During this time, these HODL wallets have boosted their portion of ETH supply from 10% to 16% i.e. 19.4 million ETH of 120 million ETH. To explain, the Accumulation Addresses are wallets that hold Ethereum but rarely move or sell their holdings. They are considered a measure of long-term investment and confidence. According to MAC_D, the rapid increase in these Ethereum HODL wallets’ holdings is a new development absent from previous bull cycles. The analyst attributed this massive accumulation rate to investors’ bullish expectations of the incoming Donald Trump administration in the US. These expectations include more favorable regulations on the DeFi industry which represents a major sector of the Ethereum ecosystem. Therefore, regardless of Ethereum’s current price movement, these long-holding wallets are likely to keep increasing their holdings in anticipation of future price growth. In addition, MAC_D emphasizes the importance of these Accumulation Addresses in that the price of Ethereum has never slipped below their realized price. Therefore, a continuous purchase by these wallets provides a high potential for a long-term price gain. Related Reading: Ethereum Investment: Trump Crypto Project Grabs 722 ETH At $2.5 Million What’s Next For ETH? In regards to Ethereum’s immediate movement, MAC_D warns that macroeconomic factors are likely to exert a stronger influence on ETH’s price in the short-term as illustrated by the recent price crash induced by potential reduced interest rate cuts in 2025. At the time of writing, the altcoin trades at $3,352 following a 3.07% decline in the past 24 hours. In tandem, ETH’s daily trading volume is down by 53.25% and valued at $31.15 billion. Following recent price falls, Ethereum also presents a negative performance on larger charts with losses of 14.74% and 1.05% in the past seven and thirty days, respectively. On a positive note, the asset’s price remains far above its initial price point ($2,397) at the start of the post-US elections price rally, indicating that long-term sentiment remains positive. With a market cap of $401 billion, Ethereum continues to rank as the second-largest cryptocurrency and largest altcoin in the digital asset market.

However, history shows that similar corrections have been followed by massive gains for the asset, with predictions of up to $6. ADAUSD. Source: TradingView ADA’s recent price performance could be analyzed from two main perspectives – short-term and long-term. When looking at the past ten days or so, the landscape is quite gloomy. Within this timeframe, the asset went from $1.2 to under $0.8. Although it has recovered some ground to $0.9 now, it is still 25% down since December 12. The broader landscape, though, shows a different picture. ADA’s price stood in a tight range between $0.3 and $0.4 for weeks ahead of the US presidential elections and the subsequent promising words by IOG’s founder, Charles Hoskinson. It exploded to a new multi-year peak of over $1.3 later on, and even now, with its correction to $0.9, it is still 160% up in less than two months. The first scenario is more painful for now, but when analyzing larger cycles, such as the current bull one, the second plays a more important role. Consequently, crypto analyst Ali Martinez focused on the long-term perspective to determine that ADA’s most recent correction could actually be a blessing in disguise. He noted that the token has followed an ‘eerily similar pattern’ to the previous cycle in 2020. Back then, the asset’s first major retracement after a substantial rally “happened at the very same time as the correction we are experiencing today.” As such, he believes ADA could shoot past its 2021 ATH of $3.09 (according to CoinGecko) and hit a new peak of $6. #Cardano $ADA is following an eerily similar pattern to its previous cycle.

We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bullish Expectations for XRP Many experts believe XRP is about to repeat its 2017 performance . The 20-day SMA is a widely used technical indicator in financial markets. It helps traders identify short- to medium-term trends by smoothing out price fluctuations. Historically, when an asset’s price remains above this moving average, it is viewed as a bullish signal, indicating the potential for further upward momentum. In both 2017 and 2024, XRP’s price behavior aligns with this pattern. Market sentiment is also helping to fuel bullish expectations. XRP has seen renewed interest following Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election and the recent announcement that Gary Gensler, current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will resign in January 2025 . XRP’s current position relative to its historical patterns suggests a potential for significant price movement. As Crypto V and others have pointed out, the asset shows many signs that it will repeat its 2017 performance.

37972945,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105140,1734873183,Here’s How Much Shiba Inu You Need to Hold to Retire Early,"This article assesses how much people need to invest in Shiba Inu to reach the $2 million retirement threshold in the United States. Many individuals hope that investing in cryptos like Shiba Inu (SHIB) will help them retire early. The amount of money required for early retirement depends on an individual’s location or appetite. For instance, someone living in a country with less cost of living may comfortably retire with a $700,000 net worth. However, this cannot be said about someone residing in a high-income country like the United States. According to a CNBC report published earlier this year, retiring in Hawaii for 25 years requires a net worth of $2 million. This is the highest retirement threshold for any U.S. state. Despite this, the CNBC report set the average amount required for retirement in the U.S. at around $1 million. How Much Shiba Inu Required for Early Retirement An investor using Shiba Inu as a retirement strategy might achieve the $2 million retirement threshold based on their initial investment in SHIB, the price of entry, and the future surge in the asset. This assessment considers three price target scenarios on how an investor can hit a net worth of $2 million by investing in Shiba Inu. $10,000 Investment in SHIB at $0.000022At the current price of $0.000022, a capital of $10,000 will fetch an investor 454,545,454 (454.54 million) SHIB. To reach the $2 million retirement threshold with a portfolio of 454.54 million Shiba Inu tokens, SHIB’s price must surge to $0.0044. This represents an outstanding surge of 19,900% from the current price of $0.000022. At $0.0044, Shiba Inu will sit on a market cap of $2.59 trillion, surpassing Bitcoin’s current valuation of $2.01 trillion by 28.85%. While Shiba Inu has shown it has strong growth prospects, its circulating supply of over 589 trillion tokens could pose a major challenge to its potential surge to $0.0044. $50,000 Investment in SHIB at $0.000022Therefore, investors who wish to retire early upon hitting the $2 million threshold need to invest more than $10,000 in Shiba Inu at its current price. For instance, an investment of $50,000 into Shiba Inu today will procure 2,272,727,272 (2.27 billion) SHIB tokens. This investment will rise to $2 million if the price of SHIB surges 3,900% from the current price of $0.000022 to $0.00088. Shiba Inu’s market cap will stand at $518.54 billion at this target, placing SHIB as the second-biggest cryptocurrency based on current realities. $100,000 Investment in SHIB at $0.000022Furthermore, investors can also make a significant investment of $100,000 in Shiba Inu to quickly reach the retirement threshold of $2 million.Notably, purchasing $100,000 worth of SHIB at the current price of $0.000022 will fetch 4,545,454,545 (4.54 billion) SHIB tokens. This portfolio of 4.54 billion SHIB will be worth $2 million when SHIB's price rises 1,900% to $0.00044 per token.At a target of $0.00044, Shiba Inu's market will stand at $259.27 billion, assuming the circulating supply remains fairly stable at 589.25 trillion tokens.Despite how lucrative this assessment seems, Shiba Inu is not guaranteed to hit any of the abovementioned targets, including $0.0044, $0.00088, or $0.00044, anytime soon. Therefore, crypto investments should be approached with caution, especially when considering them as a strategy for early retirement.",NEUTRAL,SHIB,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/22/heres-how-much-shiba-inu-you-need-to-hold-to-retire-early/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-much-shiba-inu-you-need-to-hold-to-retire-early,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/electric-elon-musk-elecmusk-solana-memecoin-to-rally-18000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-while-shib-and-doge-struggle/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37965845,https://crypto.news/?p=14321163,1734872880,From lab to ledger: Human keys secure scientific integrity | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. The speed at which AI is outgrowing regulation poses a risk to data, identity, and reputation verification and, if left unchecked, may increase the prevalence of misinformation and slow the progress of scientific innovation. The march towards super-intelligent AI is represented by its most fervent leaders as a push towards a scientific golden age. However, this push increases the chances of an existential risk of our society hitting a degradative tech plateau where widescale adoption of immature AI technology caps, and over time, degrades human creativity and innovation. You might also like: ZKP voting promises to unlock mathematically secure democracies | Opinion This is a contradictory take to most accelerationists. AI is supposed to increase our ability to do work faster and synthesize greater amounts of information. However, AI cannot replace inductive reasoning or the experimental process. Today, anyone can use AI to manufacture a scientific hypothesis and use that as input to generate a scientific paper. The results of products like Aithor often appear authoritative on the surface and may even pass peer review. This is a big problem because AI-generated texts are already being curated as legitimate scientific findings and often include bogus fabricated data to support their claims. There is a major incentive for young researchers to utilize whatever means they have available to compete for a limited number of academic jobs and funding opportunities. The current incentive system in academia rewards those who can publish the most papers, whether or not those papers describe legitimate findings—they just need to pass peer review and obtain enough citations. Academic content with unverified authorship will also pose a significant issue for industries dependent on basic science to power their research and development, the very R&D that keeps our society functioning and maintains the quality of life for a growing global population. As a result, well-funded R&D can only trust the research it is able to perform and replicate on its own, increasing the value of trade secrets and dealing a devastating blow to open science and access to meaningful information. Expensive replication efforts can deal with misinformation on its own, however, the problem is much bigger than that. Today, we’re facing an erosion of trust in the very foundations of knowledge, where unverifiable claims and ambiguous attributions undermine scientific advancements, posing a threat to the scientific community. There is a pressing need to establish a truth-based economy to authenticate content and data reliably. AI systems are as powerful as the data they are trained on Large language models are excellent tools for generating convincing content; however, they are only as informative as the data on which they are trained. Their ability to extrapolate outside of the training set still remains limited. The role of science isn’t just to synthesize existing knowledge but to create new informative artefacts that increase the entropy of the collective corpus of knowledge amassed by humanity. Over time, as more people use AI to generate content and fewer people generate original content, we’ll face a “low-entropy bloat” that does not introduce new information to the world but rather just recombines past knowledge. Primary sources will become lost as new “knowledge” is based on self-referential AI-generated content unless we build a resilient provenance and verified attribution layer into AI tools used for serious research. This “lobotomization” of the intellectual depth of the collective human corpus will lead to lasting impacts on medical, economic, and academic research as well as the arts and creative pursuits. Unverified data can influence studies, skewing outcomes and leading to important policy or technology failures that erode the authority of scientific research. The risks of AI-generated “science” are multifarious. The mundane operation of normal science will stall on authorship debates, allegations of plagiarism, and impaired peer review. We will need to devote more time and energy to deal with the many consequences of declining quality and accuracy of scientific research. AI is a useful tool for provoking ideas, structuring thoughts, and automating repetitive tasks; it must remain a complement to human-created content and not a replacement. It should not be used to author scientific papers that propose original findings without doing the work but rather as an aid to increase the efficiency and accuracy of human-led efforts. For example, AI can be helpful in running simulations on existing data with already-known methods and automating this work to help discover new research directions. However, the experimental protocol and human creativity required for scientific inquiry cannot be easily replaced. Building a truth-based economy A truth-based economy establishes a framework with systems and standards to ensure information and data authenticity, integrity, transparency, and traceability. It addresses the need to establish trust and verifiability across technological society, allowing individuals and organizations to rely on the accuracy of shared knowledge. Value is rooted in the veracity of claims and authenticity of observations and primary sources. A truth-based economy will make digital knowledge “hard” in the way that Bitcoin made fiat hard. This is the promise of the decentralized science movement. How do we get there? We need to start with the most important element in the scientific world, the individual researcher and their work. The current web standards for scientific identity today fall short of verifying claims on identity and proof of work. Current practice makes it very easy to manufacture a profile with a passable reputation; peer reviews are also at risk due to bias and collusion. Without verification of the metadata that accompanies a scientific claim, a truth-based economy for science cannot be established. Improvement to academic identity standards can begin with a simple cross-platform login powered by privacy-preserving identity verification technology. Users should be able to sign into any site with their credentials, prove authenticity, and selectively disclose facts about their reputation, data, or other agents or users. An identity layer that is rooted in a verifiable researcher’s reputation is the base foundation of DeSci. A complete on-chain scientific economy will allow public and anonymous participation in massively online coordination for research activities. Research labs and decentralized autonomous organizations can create permissionless systems and bounty programs that can’t be gamed by fraudulent reputation or identity claims. A universal scientific registry secured on blockchain with identity claims would provide a frame of reference for autonomous organizations built to amass verifiable scientific knowledge and test falsifiable hypotheses. Safeguarding the future of human progress We need to establish the foundations of truth through information transparency and rigorous verification to avoid a breakdown of trust within expert research fields. The chances of our collective progress continuing for hundreds of more years, unlocking successive scientific revolutions in materials science, biotechnology, neuroscience, and complexity science, will hinge on the curation of quality research and sound data. This will be the difference between a future society that is as advanced as we are compared to pre-enlightenment societies. Otherwise, we will have to expect that this is as smart as we get as a species, and we will only get dumber. It’s not clear if DeSci will save us or not, but there is a limited time to get things right.

However, with the growing interest in the world of cryptocurrencies, new projects are surfacing to disrupt the existing state of affairs. Up on that list is Rexas Finance (RXS), which is currently in the presale stage with only a $0.15 per token price. Sitting at the center of RXS' future expansion is the focus on real-world assets (RWA) and a strong ecosystem that will challenge established crypto brands like Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) in the near future. The vision behind the Rexas ecosystem is based on the tokenization of real-world assets, which is an emerging space that is anticipated to reach a cumulative economy of $16 trillion by 2030. This possible growth puts RXS in a competitive position alongside major players that dominate the cryptocurrency space, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP). It is expected to trade at $30 soon, but what exactly is fueling this optimism? Crypto Whales Purchased RXS Token A Closer Look at Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance is set to turn every physical asset into a digital token, meaning ownership will be fractionated. Thus, investments will be more accessible, liquid, and easy to handle. The Rexas platform has an all-inclusive set of features, including the Rexas Token Builder for no-code token creation, the Rexas Treasury for multichain yield farming, and the Rexas Launchpad, which is ideal for launching new crypto projects. By integrating features like AI yield optimization in Rexas Treasury and fractional ownership around assets, RXS is providing what Ethereum has. Still, more facilities have yet to be exploited. Tokenomics and Presale Performance With a 1 billion total supply of this ERC-20 token, the early investors are strategically placed for sustainability, with the top 20 standing a chance of winning the $1 million giveaway. The higher the number of tokens, the higher your chance. Out of the 1 billion total supply of tokens, 42.5 % are predetermined to be allocated for presale, 22.5% for staking, and 15% for liquidity, with extra percentages remaining to support the development, marketing, and the team's betterment of allocated percentages. The presale has been remarkably lucrative. The token progressed from 0.03 in stage 1 to 0.15 in stage 10, which enabled RXS to raise over $29 million. Apart from getting praise from analysts, investors generally expect it to reach $30 in the near future. Confidence in the project is strong, given that its presale has already drawn major investor interest—raising over $29,107,324 and selling out 353,213,217 tokens. Demand for the RXS token will grow as more users choose Rexas Finance to tokenize assets, increasing its value. Rising from its presale price of $0.15, current estimates indicate that RXS could reach $100 or more during the next bull market, a 69,000% rise. Comparing RXS with Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) On one hand, Ripple and Ethereum have already made their name known and are leaders in the crypto world. RXS, on the other hand, adopts a different approach with regard to asset tokenization, which, in this respect, is made by enabling the ownership of real assets on a fractional basis, allowing it to be more liquid in the market. Market Expectations and Growth Potential As more investors enter the global market, some buzz regarding RXS leads to speculation that its market capitalization might reach $10 billion. The incorporation of Rexas Finance into the market seems promising as demand for tokenizing real-world assets increases. With Rexas Finance's approaching its last presale stage, exchange listings, and initial backers are expected to reap significant benefits. Experts say strategically planned listings with the wide market exchange platforms such as Coinmarketcap and Coingecko will facilitate Rexas Finance reaching the $30 mark within months after the launch. Conclusion Rexas Finance (RXS) is an interesting prospect in the cryptocurrency space because of its goal of tokenomics on real-world assets. The successful presale and its sophisticated platform features provide a case for growth to unsurpassed popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Ripple. Visit the official Rexas Finance website to join the presale and participate in one of the most interesting projects of 2024.

37966397,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52749,1734872431,Four Meme Coins You Should Avoid and One Underrated Token to Watch Closely,"Meme coins are the wild cards of the crypto world—one day they’re “to the moon,” and the next, they’re nose-diving to the abyss. It’s a rollercoaster that leaves many investors frustrated. You throw $100 into a so-called “moonshot” coin, dreaming of millionaire status, but instead, you wake up as just another bag-holder. So, how do you avoid burning your cash? Smart decisions, folks. Here’s a rundown of meme coin flops that failed to deliver and one underdog that’s stealing the spotlight. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): Sliding on Thin Ice Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), tied to the Pudgy Penguins NFT ecosystem, made a splash on launch but quickly sank. A jaw-dropping 51% drop in just 24 hours slashed its market cap from $4 million to $2 million. Popcat (POPCAT): Clawing Its Way Down Inspired by the viral “Popcat” meme, Popcat (POPCAT) was all hype, no substance. Within a month, it fell 47%, losing 19% in a week and 8% in a single day, with trading volume shrinking by 11%. DOGS Token (DOGS): Barking Up the Wrong Tree Launched on the TON blockchain to leverage Telegram’s massive user base, DOGS Token (DOGS) is struggling to stay afloat. Its price plummeted 33% in 30 days, with a 7% daily drop and declining market cap. Simon’s Cat Token ($CAT): Declawed and Declining Despite its nostalgic charm and animal welfare focus, Simon’s Cat Token ($CAT) couldn’t escape the meme coin curse. Over the past month, it dropped 25%, shedding 2.9% in a week and a brutal 27% in 24 hours, with trading volume down 40%. These animals are not cutting it anymore. The meme coin market is turning into a zoo. It’s a tired concept that’s lost its spark. Every new coin looks like a clone of the last, offering nothing fresh or exciting. In this overcrowded jungle of meme coins, one project is standing out by ditching the furry trend altogether. A fresh concept is drawing the spotlight, shining with something beyond the same old gimmicks. XYZVerse +1,233%—And This Champion is Just Warming Up Among a bunch of creepy animals, $XYZ brings something new to the table . It is the first ever all-sports meme coin rewriting the playbook with its relentless drive and competitive spirit, much like the athletes who inspire it. XYZVerse forms an ecosystem designed for champions , bringing together sports fans, gamers, and crypto enthusiasts under one vibrant banner. Currently in presale, $XYZ is already scoring big: Launch Price: $0.0001 Current Price: $0.001333 ( +1233% ) Final Stage Target: $0.1—an unbelievable 99,900% surge if achieved. XYZVerse is Heating Up, and This is Your Chance to Get in Early Why $XYZ Is Gaining Traction What’s fueling this explosive growth ? It’s simple: community, vision, and results. The XYZVersers, a rapidly growing base of supporters, are the lifeblood of the project. Unlike many meme coins that rely on fleeting hype, $XYZ is already delivering tangible progress, thanks to its presale strategy and ambitious roadmap. The project’s foundation is rock-solid. $XYZ is redefining the meme coin market with a concept that blends sports culture with cutting-edge crypto technology . This isn’t another coin trying to cash in on a trend; it’s creating an entirely new playbook. Ambitious Plans Backed by Action $XYZ’s roadmap doesn’t stop at a clever theme. The project is built to deliver long-term value: Major Exchange Listings: Aiming for global visibility and accessibility. Staking and Passive Rewards: Giving holders more reasons to stay engaged. Scalability on Polygon: Fast, efficient, and low-cost transactions. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with sports media outlets and exclusive digital creators to amplify its reach. These are calculated steps to ensure $XYZ has the staying power most meme coins lack. What’s Next for $XYZ? With the presale nearing its final stages, the real action is about to begin. The Token Generation Event (TGE) and public listings are on the horizon, and that’s when $XYZ will step into the global spotlight. More exposure, more liquidity, and a stronger community mean the potential for even greater growth. XYZVerse is building an ecosystem where sports fandom meets crypto culture, creating a space where engagement and rewards go hand in hand. If the presale results are anything to go by, this is only the beginning of what $XYZ can achieve. Choose Your Meme Coin Wisely The meme coin market is often treacherous terrain, filled with flashy promises and underwhelming results. But in the midst of this chaos, XYZVerse is proving to be a rare exception — a champion in the making. With a sports-driven ecosystem, an impressive 1,233% presale surge, and a roadmap built for sustainability, XYZVerse is showing all the signs of a long-term player in the crypto space. For investors tired of empty promises and looking for a meme coin with real value, XYZVerse offers a fresh opportunity.

At just $0.15, this newly discovered altcoin is generating waves in the market thanks to seasoned investors and even Ripple (XRP) millionaires betting large on its future. Forecasts are hot; some analysts boldly assert that Rexas might reach $30 by 2025, a startling 200x increase equaling some of the most fabled crypto profits. Although XRP has long been the preferred asset for anyone interested in blockchain payments and cross-border transactions, its recent increase has stalled. Rexas Finance is today's ""XRP alternative"" and is ready to take the stage. With its innovative real-world utility, effective presale, and long-term success-oriented ecosystem, Rexas might be the hottest crypto of the week and the year. Whales Have Accumulated RXS Why Is Rexas Finance the XRP Alternative to Watch? Ripple (XRP) has easily established itself as one of the frontrunners in the blockchain space, primarily for its role within international payment systems. However, given its lackluster price performance of late, investors are seeking other candidates, even though XRP’s cost and time metrics have made it popular among financial institutions. Now enter Rexas Finance, a coin with excellent upside potential that not only presents creative ideas. Unlike many other altcoins, Rexas Finance is based on actual usefulness. The idea is to tokenize real-world assets (RWA), exposing investors to physical objects such as intellectual property, fine art, and real estate. By closing the distance between conventional banking and blockchain technologies, Rexas opens liquidity in hitherto unreachable markets. This utility-driven approach positions Rexas Finance as more than another speculative token. With its actual use cases and long-term value, this initiative appeals to XRP investors who wish to diversify into a viable new enterprise. A Presale Shattering Records Rexas Finance has had nothing less than fantastic momentum. Already having its tenth-stage presale, RXS has sold more than 352.1 million tokens and raised over $29 million. This unheard-of performance emphasizes the increasing trust among institutional and individual investors about Rexas as a game-changing prospect. At just $0.15, RXS provides a distinctive ground-floor access point for those keen to guarantee significant returns. Rexas Finance is still in its early years and has significantly more upside potential than XRP, which has already seen most of its expansion. Should forecasts of $30 in 2025 come to pass, current investors could witness transforming results. Backed by Security and Trust Separating reputable projects from dangerous endeavors is one of the most challenging difficulties in cryptocurrencies, yet Rexas Finance has already proven itself a reliable competitor. The project's CertiK audit passed successfully, guaranteeing that the platform meets the highest security and transparency criteria. Two of the most reliable websites for monitoring crypto data, CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, also mention Rexas Finance. These listings give investors peace of mind, knowing they are working on a project designed to last, validating Rexas. Rexas Finance is unique among the hype-filled markets for its strong basis and investor-friendly strategy. RXS is a very appealing substitute for XRP because of its mix of security, usability, and momentum. Why $30 Could Be Within Reach Although Rexas Finance's $30 price estimate sounds high, looking at its trajectory makes the aim seem considerably more reasonable. Driven by its use and institutional acceptance, ripple's XRP expanded enormously in past bull cycles. Rexas Finance is now traveling a similar route with greater adaptability and practical applications. The value of RXS is likely primarily driven by the growing need for actual asset tokenization. With blockchain technology, Rexas Finance is opening these markets to regular investors from traditional assets like real estate, valued at trillions worldwide. Should the platform continue to increase its acceptance, RXS might take a sizable portion of this enormous market, driving its price to unprecedented levels. Combining this with the project's successful presale, CertiK-audited security, and forthcoming exchange listings makes it clear why some analysts think RXS might reach $30 by 2025. Rexas Finance gives individuals who missed out on XRP's explosive climb another opportunity to ride a coin with revolutionary potential. Investors Are Betting Big on RXS Real investment action supports the buzz around Rexas Finance , not simply speculation. Crypto titans, retail traders, and seasoned XRP millionaires focus on RXS because they recognize its unique value proposition and explosive potential. Rexas Finance is a readily available investment for traders of all kinds, given the present $0.15 price tag. RXS presents the possibility for life-changing rewards regardless of your level of investment, from small to large players looking for the next great opportunity for portfolio growth. Conclusion For a good reason, Rexas Finance (RXS) is fast-rising and the trendiest cryptocurrency on the crypto market. At just $0.15, this XRP substitute offers real-world value, great investor confidence, and a clear growth roadmap. Rexas allows investors to achieve significant gains that might equal XRP's most successful years, with forecasts of a $30 price objective by 2025. Rexas Finance is stepping in to provide the innovation and value today's investors want as Ripple's expansion slows. RXS might be the token that provides the life-changing rewards people looking for the next great cryptocurrency opportunity have been waiting for.

Recent developments, including strategic partnerships and significant blockchain activity, underscore the growing institutional reliance on XRP for settlement solutions. Global Banks Look to Ripple for Crypto Integration Andrew De’Vilbiss, a noted crypto analyst, recently hinted at transformative moves involving Ripple, Bitstamp, and top-tier global banks.

Ripple’s ownership stake in Bitstamp and XRP’s role as a settlement layer position it for significant adoption,” tweeted De’Vilbiss. Ripple’s approach to integrating XRP into FX liquidity management offers notable advantages. With faster settlement times and reduced costs, XRP provides an efficient alternative to traditional financial systems, potentially reshaping institutional operations. Whale Activity Signals XRP’s Growing Utility Complementing institutional developments, Whale Alert flagged a massive transfer of 40 million XRP, valued at $89.68 million, from Ripple to an unknown wallet: 40,000,000 #XRP ($89,678,944 USD) transferred from #Ripple to unknown wallet. View transaction 10:16 PM · Dec 21, 2024 Such transactions often indicate preparation for institutional liquidity needs or upcoming high-value settlements. These movements reflect Ripple’s strategy of fostering liquidity for global adoption, further solidifying XRP’s role as a bridge asset. Why Institutional Adoption Boosts XRP Ripple’s growing institutional reach could redefine XRP’s market value. Key benefits include: Liquidity Enhancement: Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions provide deep liquidity pools critical for high-volume transactions. Cost Efficiency: XRP’s ultra-low fees and rapid settlements appeal to institutions aiming to reduce costs. Market Penetration: Partnerships with Bitstamp and banks introduce XRP to a vast new audience of institutional traders and investors. De’Vilbiss emphasized the impact of these developments, noting, “This is much bigger than expected.” Technical Outlook: XRP/USD – December 22, 2024 XRP is trading at $2.26, down 0.53% in the last 24 hours, with a trading volume of $12.59 billion. The cryptocurrency faces a downward trendline resistance near $2.30, which aligns with the pivot point. This level continues to limit upside momentum, suggesting a selling bias unless breached. The 50-day EMA , hovering near the trendline, adds another resistance layer. Key levels to watch include: Resistance: $2.30, $2.43, $2.58 Support: $2.11, $1.96, $1.85 The RSI at 46 indicates neutral momentum, leaning bearish. A decisive break below $2.26 could lead to further declines, while a move above $2.30 may signal a reversal.

According to the analyst's estimate, the BTC price could be at $ 120,000 in two months. Peterson bases this estimate on ETF fund flows in the US. However, he also stated that the model he used was a partially conservative estimate and 80% of the time the price was higher than the estimate. According to Peterson, for the Bitcoin price to reach $120,000, fund flows would need to increase by 27% to $46 billion, an increase of $10 billion. He argues that with current growth rates, this amount could be reached within 60 days.

At the time of writing, the BTC price is trading at $97,000 and has lost approximately 5% of its value in the last week. *This is not investment advice.

37965260,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313786,1734871550,"Ethereum Set To Move Up Against Bitcoin, According to Analyst Benjamin Cowen – Here’s His Outlook","A closely followed crypto analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) looks primed to surge against Bitcoin ( BTC ) as we enter the new year. In a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 848,000 YouTube subscribers that based on historical trends, Ethereum should soon bottom out against the top crypto asset by market cap. According to Cowen, ETH/BTC will rise sometime in early 2025 no matter how the crypto king fares against the US dollar. “Think about this: historically, ETH/BTC bottoms out either in December or January. It’s already December [22nd]. My guess? ETH stays weak against Bitcoin, probably for the rest of the year. It doesn’t mean you can’t have a green week – but it’s probably going to stay weak for the rest of the year, maybe early January, and then I would expect ETH/BTC to start moving up in 2025, regardless of the direction of BTC/USD.” Cowen goes on to note that also based on previous market cycles, 2025 should be a good year for ETH/BTC in terms of quarterly returns. “2022 Q1 and Q2 were red, then you had Q3 and Q4 [that] were green. The only other quarter that ETH/BTC has been green besides the second half of 2022 for the last three years was Q2 2024… But what do you notice about 2021? ETH/BTC was green. What do you notice about 2017? At least ETH/BTC was green in the first half, it was red in the second half but then it was green in 2018 as well. So I would argue as quarterly returns go, you’re probably going to see more green for ETH/BTC in 2025 and maybe even early 2026.” ETH/BTC is valued at 0.03444 ($3,343.71) at time of writing.

At $0.00036, a simple $500 investment in Dogecoin in 2014 would be worth an impressive $1,017,870. Although the history of Dogecoin shows the promise of cryptocurrencies, investors are now looking at other options, such as Rexas Finance (RXS), a $0.15 token sold during its continuous presale. With forecasts of a 250,000% increase, RXS might match the legendary returns of Dogecoin, thereby presenting the next major prospect for crypto enthusiasts. Crypto Whales Purchased RXS Token Dogecoin’s Journey: From Meme Coin to Multi-Million Dollar Asset Originally shown as a fun crypto in 2013, Dogecoin gained major popularity only in 2017. After its launch, DOGE's price hovered at $0.00036 for a number of years, yielding not very significant increases. Early on in the 2017 bitcoin bull market, there was a first notable price surge. March saw a 1,494% surge in Dogecoin, which peaked at $0.004 and dropped to $0.001 in the following months. Driven by a flood of hopeful investors, DOGE rebuilt momentum in late 2017 and by January 2018 it had reached $0.018. However, with celebrities like Tesla CEO Elon Musk sponsoring Dogecoin, its most important turning point came in 2021. In just five months, DOGE rose astonishingly 9,484% from $0.0046 in January to an all-time high of $0.74 in May. This climb reaffirmed Dogecoin's place as the top cryptocurrency and made more than $1 million out of a $500 investment in 2014. Rexas Finance (RXS): The DOGE Alternative Although Dogecoin offers historical returns, many investors are now looking at substitutes that can provide similar or even better chances for development. As the crypto market develops and competition rises, spotting tokens with good foundations and development potential is difficult. Rexas Finance (RXS) and other newly developed tokens are positioned as the future generation of investment-worthy cryptocurrencies. RXS draws in savvy investors with its inventive use case and presale price of $0.15. Because of their low entrance prices and a great capacity for expansion, analysts believe early-stage projects like Rexas Finance are most likely to yield Dogecoin-level profits. The new cryptocurrency, Rexas Finance (RXS), provides unmatched access to tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), transforming asset management. With the platform, users may tokenize and trade assets, including intellectual property, art, and real estate, offering countless investment prospects. Using its innovative methodology, RXS meets the growing need for democratized ownership and asset liquidity in the worldwide financial system. Reflecting great investor trust, Rexas Finance has already raised $29.32 million in its tenth presale stage. Priced at $0.15, RXS offers early investors a great prospect, particularly considering its expected listing price of $0.20. Early attendees have already observed a 5x increase in value from the first presale stage, suggesting the coin's explosive potential. Can Rexas Finance (RXS) Do The Same? Because of its unique value proposition, market observers think Rexas Finance could surpass several current cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin. Unlike Dogecoin, which mostly depends on community support and market sentiment, RXS presents an actual use case that attracts institutional and retail investors. Experts estimate that RXS might yield more than 250,000% returns, matching or surpassing the 203,474% increase in Dogecoin since 2014. Furthermore, fueling investor interest is Rexas Finance's $1 million gift. The platform is fast growing its community by enrolling over 558,000 people for the competition. Investors must accomplish particular requirements, hold at least $100 worth of RXS tokens, and promote people to the initiative to be eligible for the giveaway, guaranteeing broad involvement. Rexas Finance is exciting as it gets ready for its official introduction. The token's creative use case and appealing presale pricing help make it a top candidate for good returns. However, it is yet unknown if RXS can match Dogecoin's explosive rise; its strong foundations and investor interest point to a promising future. Rexas Finance is an appealing option for individuals who want to profit from the next major crypto prospect. Given its emphasis on actual asset tokenization and past presale success, RXS could be the DOGE alternative investors have been looking for.

37966395,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52821,1734870632,"From $7.4M Presale Triumph to Blockchain Domination: Why Qubetics, Solana, and Polkadot Are The Best Cryptos to Buy Now","The cryptocurrency market never ceases to amaze, and December 2024 is proving no exception. From Solana’s incredible recovery to Polkadot’s cutting-edge advancements, blockchain technology is evolving at lightning speed. Amid these developments, Qubetics is emerging as a revolutionary project with a record-breaking presale and a focus on solving blockchain’s most pressing challenges. While Solana and Polkadot continue to dominate conversations about scalability and multi-chain ecosystems, Qubetics is carving its niche with innovative solutions and real-world applications. With $7 million raised in its ongoing presale, it’s quickly becoming one of the best cryptos to buy now for investors and developers alike. Let’s dive into what makes these three projects game-changers in the blockchain world. Qubetics: Leading the Charge in Blockchain Scalability Qubetics is much more than a cryptocurrency; it’s a comprehensive blockchain platform designed to tackle some of the most persistent challenges in the digital economy, including scalability, security, and interoperability . These attributes position Qubetics as one of the best cryptos to buy now, whether you’re looking for short-term gains or long-term innovation. A Presale for the Record Books In its 13th stage, the Qubetics presale has raised over $7.4 million, sold more than 365 million $TICS tokens, and attracted more than 11,100 holders. At a price of $0.0342 per token, the clock is ticking before a 10% price hike kicks in at the weekend. Analysts are making bold predictions: $0.25 by the presale’s end (630% ROI), $1 post-presale (2,820% ROI), and $15 following the mainnet launch (a staggering 43,711% ROI). Imagine investing $60,000 today at $0.0342 per token. That investment could grow to $438,450 at $0.25, balloon to $1,753,800 at $1, and reach an eye-popping $26,307,000 at $15. These numbers highlight why Qubetics($TICS) is capturing the attention of savvy investors. Why Scalability Matters Scalability is the backbone of blockchain technology, and Qubetics is leading the charge. For businesses, scalability means being able to handle thousands of transactions per second without network congestion or skyrocketing fees. Picture a global retailer using Qubetics to process real-time payments across multiple continents without breaking a sweat. For professionals and developers, scalability opens doors for building dApps that can cater to millions of users simultaneously. Imagine a healthcare platform managing patient data across various jurisdictions in seconds or an e-commerce giant enabling seamless cross-border payments in multiple cryptocurrencies. Qubetics’ focus on scalability isn’t just technical jargon—it’s the key to unlocking blockchain’s full potential for individuals, businesses, and industries. Solana: The Speed Demon of Blockchain Solana has made a name for itself as one of the fastest blockchains in the world. With its lightning-quick transaction speeds and low fees, it’s no wonder Solana has become a favourite among developers and investors looking for the best cryptos to buy now. After weathering a storm following the FTX collapse, Solana has roared back to life with a staggering 2,100% rebound. This isn’t just a price story—it’s a testament to the strength of its ecosystem. From decentralised finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Solana continues to attract projects that demand speed and efficiency. Bitwise’s introduction of a staking ETP for Solana, offering a 6.48% yield, signals growing institutional interest in the blockchain. These developments are boosting Solana’s credibility and attracting more investors looking for stable, high-yield opportunities in the crypto space. Solana’s ability to handle thousands of transactions per second has made it a go-to platform for developers building dApps that require scale and speed. Whether it’s gaming, DeFi, or payments, Solana’s ecosystem is thriving, and its future looks brighter than ever. Polkadot: The King of Interoperability Polkadot is often referred to as the “blockchain of blockchains,” and for good reason. Its innovative parachain system allows different blockchains to communicate and share data seamlessly, making it a pioneer in interoperability. Polkadot’s upcoming 2.0 upgrade promises to make its parachain system even more application-centric. Developers will have more tools to create dApps that combine Polkadot’s interoperability with Ethereum’s smart contract functionality. This positions Polkadot as one of the best cryptos to buy now for developers and businesses looking to build scalable, multi-chain applications. Polkadot’s ecosystem is more than just a concept—it’s actively solving real-world problems. From supply chain tracking to cross-border payments, Polkadot’s technology is being used to create more efficient systems across industries. Its focus on interoperability ensures that businesses don’t have to choose one blockchain over another—they can have it all. Conclusion: Why Qubetics Stands Out Solana and Polkadot are giants in the blockchain world, each excelling in their niches. Solana’s focus on speed and low costs has made it a favourite for developers and investors alike, while Polkadot’s leadership in interoperability ensures it remains a key player in the multi-chain future. But Qubetics is the new contender that’s turning heads. With its record-breaking presale, innovative solutions like scalability-focused architecture, and incredible ROI potential, Qubetics is more than just a token—it’s a vision for the future of blockchain. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this groundbreaking project. Visit Qubetics’ presale page today and secure your $TICS tokens before the price hike. With $7.4 million already raised, the best cryptos to buy now don’t wait—and neither should you!

Qubetics Might Be December’s Best Way to Turn Things Around,"Remember Binance’s early days? It wasn’t always the crypto powerhouse it is now. Back in 2017, its ICO offered BNB tokens for what now feels like pocket change. Fast forward, and Binance has grown into a global phenomenon, leaving those who hesitated wondering what could’ve been. Stories like these sting, don’t they? They’re a harsh reminder of the power of early action in crypto and how waiting too long can mean losing out. But here’s the good news: missed chances don’t have to define your future. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a project with its sights set on revolutionising the crypto space. Its presale is creating a stir among investors, offering a rare opportunity to get in early on something that blends innovation with usability. If Binance’s success is any indicator, projects like Qubetics could be the next chapter in your crypto journey. Qubetics Presale Could Be the Big Opportunity You’re Looking For If you didn’t make the whitelist for Qubetics, you missed out on a $0.01 entry point reserved for a lucky few. And as the presale moved through its early stages, prices stayed incredibly low, rewarding those who acted fast. But it’s not all bad news—you still have time to get in on the action. The Qubetics presale is now in its 13th stage, with tokens priced at $0.0342. Here’s how it works: each presale stage lasts seven days, ending every Sunday at midnight, with a 10% price increase kicking in as soon as the new stage starts. So far, over $7.4 million has been raised, more than 365 million tokens have been sold, and 11,100+ holders are already on board. That’s a lot of people betting on Qubetics becoming the next big thing. Why the buzz? It’s all about the QubeQode IDE , a development environment that’s making blockchain tech accessible to everyone. Imagine you’re a small business looking to integrate blockchain for better transaction security. Instead of hiring an expensive team of developers, you could use QubeQode’s drag-and-drop tools to add features like token management or data storage to your application. Even startups and enterprises are finding value here. The form-based configuration lets users customise smart contract logic with zero coding experience. And for developers, the code snippet library offers a collection of pre-written blockchain solutions, saving time and cutting costs. Whether you’re an entrepreneur, a freelancer, or a large-scale operation, Qubetics provides tools that are practical and forward-thinking. How Binance’s ICO Paved the Way for Its Success Binance wasn’t always a household name in crypto. Back in 2017, its ICO sold BNB tokens at $0.11 each. Fast forward a few years, and Binance has become one of the most influential players in the space, building an ecosystem that includes an exchange, a launchpad, and even its own blockchain. At its all-time high, BNB rewarded early investors with mind-blowing returns, proving that taking calculated risks in crypto can pay off in a big way. But the road wasn’t always smooth. Binance faced challenges like regulatory scrutiny and stiff competition, yet it continued to innovate and expand. Those who got in early and held on reaped the benefits, while those who hesitated were left wishing they hadn’t. The lesson here is simple: success in crypto often favours those who act early. Binance’s journey shows how a strong vision combined with the right timing can turn a modest investment into something life-changing. And now, Qubetics offers a chance to apply those lessons to a new, promising project. Act Now Before This Opportunity Slips Away Regret over missed chances like Binance doesn’t have to linger forever. Qubetics is here, offering a fresh start for those ready to act. The presale is in full swing, and the clock is ticking on the 13th stage . With each week bringing a price increase, waiting could mean paying more or missing out entirely. If you’re ready to take control of your crypto journey, now’s the time to make a move. Qubetics is proving that early action can set the stage for future success, just like Binance did years ago. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by.

According to Santiment, social media saw a spike in mentions of Bitcoin potentially falling below $90,000 in late November, coinciding with the market bottoming near $91,600—a signal often interpreted as a buying opportunity for seasoned investors. Santiment’s tweet highlights this behavior: “Crypto markets historically move the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations, because the mass majority of the crowd is made up of retail traders,” tweeted @Santimentfeed. Crypto markets historically move the opposite direction of the crowd's expectations, because the mass majority of the crowd is made up of retail traders.

Small traders buy tops and sell bottoms, so whales make money. pic.twitter.com/CB2kLgPkl6 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 21, 2024 This zero-sum-game behavior shows that retail traders often buy tops and sell bottoms, while whales profit from contrarian moves. Retail Euphoria and Whale Accumulation In early December, Bitcoin surprised traders by surging past $100,000, sparking social euphoria. Mentions of $110,000 skyrocketed as traders predicted new highs. However, as Santiment pointed out in a subsequent tweet, this optimism led to profit-taking by larger players, triggering a pullback to current levels. “In early December, FOMO was rampant after BTC’s historical moment above $100K. The celebration was short-lived,” Santiment highlighted. In early December, after retail traders were surprised that Bitcoin had instead ascended to above $103K (after repeated failed rallies to breach $100K), FOMO was rampant following BTC's historical moment. As you may guess, the celebration was short-lived. pic.twitter.com/zzp2sJUEs5 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 21, 2024 Whale Accumulation: The Long Game While retail sentiment swings wildly, whales and sharks—holders of 10+ BTC wallets—have steadily accumulated during periods of fear. Santiment’s data shows that these key stakeholders leveraged the retail-driven panic in late November to add to their holdings. “History says that you should follow the long-term trajectory of whales and sharks,” emphasized @Santimentfeed in their analysis. This activity aligns with Bitcoin’s tendency to rebound strongly after retail-driven dips.

It remains the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, at $1.92 trillion, with a circulating supply of 19.8 million BTC. The cryptocurrency faces resistance at $99,230, reinforced by a prior trendline turned horizontal barrier. The 50-day EMA near $98,670 further limits upward momentum. A failure to clear these levels could prompt additional selling. BTC faces key resistance at $99K, with support holding near $95K. RSI at 47 signals neutral momentum. A breakout above $99K could target $102K-$105K, while failure risks further downside.

The RSI at 47 signals neutral momentum with a slight bearish inclination. Bitcoin’s consolidation between $95,790 and $99,230 suggests potential for either a breakout toward $102,650 and $105,380 or a breakdown toward lower supports. Traders should closely watch volume and momentum near $99,230 for clearer directional cues. Key Insights: Retail Fear: Social mentions of sub-$90K Bitcoin during November’s bottom at $91,600 signal potential buying opportunities. Whale Accumulation: Whales continue to accumulate, indicating confidence in long-term price growth. Technical Levels: Resistance at $99,228 is critical for upside momentum; support at $95,792 holds the key to maintaining stability. Bitcoin’s price story emphasizes the need to balance sentiment analysis with technical levels.

37964893,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631877,1734870084,BaFin and ECB approve Germany’s DekaBank for crypto custody,"Germany’s DekaBank has scored a major win, bagging a crypto custody license from BaFin, the country’s financial watchdog, and the European Central Bank (ECB). The license was granted under the Banking Act (KWG) and DekaBank will be joining Commerzbank as one of the only traditional German banks to operate in this space. But let’s not get too excited—this is Germany, after all, where regulation is the order of the day, and every action is measured. While BaFin has granted crypto custody licenses to 11 other firms, most of those have gone to crypto-native companies, like the digital asset custody arm of Hauck Aufhäuser Lampe Privatbank. DekaBank’s license game is strong What makes DekaBank and Commerzbank stand out is that their licenses fall under traditional banking regulations, giving them a level of legitimacy that smaller crypto firms can only dream of. This isn’t DekaBank’s first big regulatory decision this year. Back in July, it snagged a license to operate as a crypto securities registrar. Translation? It can issue blockchain-based digital securities in Germany without needing a central securities depository (CSD). This cuts out unnecessary middlemen, a very crypto thing to do. DekaBank is also a founding member of SWIAT, a blockchain platform designed for digital securities issuance. It’s got giants like Standard Chartered and LBBW involved. Back in September, Siemens used SWIAT to issue a €300 million digital bond. Germany’s regulatory speed bump The Supervision of Crypto Markets Act (KMAG) is supposed to replace Germany’s old crypto rules with MiCA’s shiny new framework. But because the German government has been a political circus lately, the law was delayed for months. It only passed on December 18, giving institutions like DekaBank the green light to expand their crypto operations across the EU. Before KMAG’s passage, the regulatory limbo made things awkward for banks. Germany’s slow but steady approach to crypto regulation has its perks, though. Back in 2013, the country became one of the first to recognize cryptocurrencies as financial instruments. Then, in 2020, it made BaFin licensing mandatory for all crypto exchanges. While other countries are still fumbling with vague guidelines, Germany’s clarity on crypto rules makes it a heavyweight in the European crypto scene. Admittedly, it is boring, but it works. Germany’s crypto regulation is pretty much MiCA. But in the country, crypto held for over a year is exempt from capital gains tax, offering a major incentive for long-term investors. However, if you sell within a year, the profits face regular income tax rates, which can hit up to 45%, plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge. There’s some relief for smaller players, though—profits below €600 escape taxation entirely. As for the market, it’s very active. Out of 2,400 private crypto investors surveyed, 54% said they allocate more than 20% of their total assets to digital assets. On average, these investors are putting over a quarter of their portfolios into crypto. Security concerns are still top of mind, though. About 82% of investors flagged platform security as their number-one consideration when choosing where to invest. It’s no surprise that Bitcoin leads the pack, held by 91% of respondents, followed by Ethereum at 78%. Solana, a rising star, is also gaining traction. The German market has had its share of drama this year too though. The most significant episode was probably when the government unloaded a massive 49,858 BTC for $2.89 billion—leftovers from a piracy case.

37964652,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375637,1734869907,These Challenges Affect Institutional Crypto Adoption Strategies (Survey),"A new survey by the blockchain infrastructure provider P2P.org has unveiled some challenges and trends affecting institutions’ crypto adoption strategies. It also highlighted opportunities that institutions could explore to adapt to the evolving practices in the crypto industry. The survey included participation from more than 15 institutional players, with intermediaries, investment funds, and venture capital funds making up 46%, 31%, and 23% of the respondents, respectively. It is worth mentioning that intermediaries in this context refer to companies that manage assets on behalf of others, while institutions as a whole are those with large total value locked. Trends Affecting Institutional Crypto Strategies According to the results sent to CryptoPotato , 33.4% of respondents said the biggest challenge faced by their company is integrating new crypto yield products aligned with their risk tolerance. Another 13.3% revealed that regulatory compliance affects their ability to incorporate new products in their offerings. Additionally, 6.67% of the participants said it is difficult to find the right strategy for allocating crypto assets, while another 6.67% disclosed that integrating multiple yield solutions at a go has been a big challenge. Interestingly, 6.67% of the respondents attributed their biggest challenge to custodians limiting product functionality, while the remaining 33.29% mentioned other challenges not outlined in the report. P2P.org identified risk as a recurring theme during the interviews, and it was mentioned across multiple levels, including technology, operations, and regulation. For technology, the respondents insisted that smart contracts pose a risk to their organization’s security and reliability. Challenges In Operations and Regulation In operations, the surveyees explained how certain blockchain mechanics could affect the movement of funds across industries. For instance, withdrawing funds from staked tokens could make the assets unavailable for some time, limiting how quickly capital can be redeployed to other business areas. When it came to regulation, the participants disclosed that one of their biggest challenges was integrating a new product that was in line with the regulatory guidelines for their business region. “The involvement of legal and compliance team here is critical to assess the exact risk factor. As reported in one of the interview, failing to correctly assess the regulatory layer can affect the resources allocated to a new product initiative, which might later be deemed unacceptable by regulatory authorities,” P2P.org stated. With regulatory requirements posing a significant challenge, these institutions are facing limitations in product integration and innovation.

37964902,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52855,1734869289,Longest Running Exchange Says XRP Will Make History In 2025,"Bitstamp recently released an optimistic forecast regarding XRP’s future performance. The exchange predicted via its official X handle that XRP will make history in 2025, generating substantial interest within the cryptocurrency community. While Bitstamp did not provide specifics for the prediction, it is renowned as the cryptocurrency industry’s longest-operating exchange, and several positive developments in the short and long-term support this overwhelmingly bullish outlook. $XRP gonna make history next year — Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) December 20, 2024 Reasons to Be Bullish On XRP One of the biggest reasons to be bullish about XRP is Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election. The excitement following his historic win sent the crypto market to new heights. Bitcoin has crossed $100k for the first time, and XRP hit its highest point since 2018. Notably, XRP reached its all-time high in January 2018 during Trump’s last administration , and the market is excited about how high it can go next year. There are also many other positive developments in the crypto market to be excited about. These include the anticipated conclusion of Ripple’s ongoing legal proceedings and the possible introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Gary Gensler, the current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is well known for his anti-crypto stance, but he is leaving his position on January 20. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Donald Trump has already nominated Paul Atkins to replace him, and experts believe the SEC, under Atkins’ pro-crypto administration, will end the lawsuits against Ripple and other cryptocurrency companies. Multiple companies have also filed for XRP ETFs. However, the SEC revealed that it will not approve any ETFs under the current administration. XRP’s Journey to A New All-time High The digital asset’s price trajectory has demonstrated notable volatility over the past few years. After establishing its current all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018, XRP experienced a significant decline, reaching $0.1151 by March 2020. At press time, XRP traded at $2.23, 41.51% below its all-time high, and many experts are confident it will close this gap and surpass it significantly. Recent market activity has shown promising signs of recovery, and JD (@jaydee_757), a prominent crypto analyst, responded to Bitstamp’s post, noting that 95% of investors will lose out on massive gains in the current cycle. Analysts are already setting lofty targets with some going into double and triple digits , but investors have to take profits wisely so they don’t lose out on life-changing gains.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s a game-changer in the digital world. Created by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, it introduced smart contracts and a bustling ecosystem of decentralized apps. It’s moved to a Proof-of-Stake system, making it more energy-efficient. With Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, transactions are faster and cheaper. Ethereum also brought us ERC-20 tokens, which are used across many applications for things like governance and utility. Ether (ETH) is the fuel that keeps it all running, used for transactions, rewarding those who stake their coins, and acting as a valuable asset. Looking ahead, Ethereum’s future seems bright. The network plans to introduce sharding, which will make it even more scalable and reduce costs. Price predictions based on past trends suggest ETH could reach as high as $6,580.53 next year and might not go lower than $2,700.31 in 2025. Compared to other coins, Ethereum stands out for its strong technology and active development. In the current market, with growing interest in decentralized finance and efficient blockchain solutions, ETH looks like a promising option. Its ongoing innovations and central role in the crypto ecosystem make it an attractive choice for many. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin began in 2013 as a playful twist on the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the lovable Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no cap on the total number. What started as a joke quickly gained a following, showcasing the power of community and social media in driving interest. In 2021, Dogecoin captured global attention as its value skyrocketed. Fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from personalities like Elon Musk, it surged into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, exceeding $50 billion. Technologically, Dogecoin offers faster transaction times and lower fees compared to some of its peers, making it appealing for everyday use. As the crypto market evolves, Dogecoin remains notable for its strong community support and widespread recognition. While its abundant supply contrasts with the scarcity of coins like Bitcoin, its accessibility and enthusiastic following keep it in the conversation amid current market trends. XRP (XRP) Meet XRP, a cryptocurrency designed to revolutionize how we transfer money across the globe. Built on the XRP Ledger, XRP is a digitally native, programmable currency that’s fast, low-cost, and open to everyone. It operates without a central authority, making transactions irreversible and secure. This means you can send money anywhere in the world without needing a bank account, and without worrying about censorship or counterfeiting. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP launched with 100 billion tokens, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple for further development. XRP aims to facilitate seamless payment transfers across different currencies, reflecting its name derived from “ripple credits.” Ripple, initially known as OpenCoin Inc., uses XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem, placing 55 billion XRP in escrow for controlled release. In the current market cycle, XRP stands out for its potential to transform international payments with its speed and efficiency. Compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP offers faster transaction times and lower fees, making it attractive for both individuals and financial institutions. As the crypto market evolves, XRP’s focus on real-world utility could position it favorably among its peers. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is making waves in the world of cryptocurrency. It’s a platform designed for creating smart contracts, which are like digital agreements that work without middlemen. Cardano’s own cryptocurrency is called ADA. People use ADA to store value, make payments, and even earn more by supporting the network. What’s exciting is that ADA is seen as a rival to Ethereum’s ETH because it offers similar benefits but aims to be more efficient. One thing that sets Cardano apart is its environmentally friendly approach. Instead of using lots of energy like some other cryptocurrencies, Cardano uses a method called proof-of-stake, which is much kinder to the planet. The platform is also divided into two layers, which helps it process many transactions quickly—some say up to a million per second! In today’s market, with a growing focus on sustainability and speed, ADA looks very attractive. As more people look for greener options in crypto, Cardano’s ADA might be the coin to watch. Conclusion Though ETH, DOGE, XRP, and ADA hold promising prospects, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for significant growth through a community-driven ecosystem.

37964198,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666208,1734868821,Ethereum Price Drops 12% As Spot ETFs Witness Significant Net Outflows,"The Ethereum price has been a joy to watch in recent weeks after initially struggling to keep pace with other large-cap cryptocurrencies. However, the past week will be a quick one to forget for the crypto market, especially the altcoin, which declined in value by over 12%. While this price slump experienced by Ethereum has been linked to the US Federal Reserve rate cut, the recent drab performances of the spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could also be associated. After a lengthy spell of positive inflows, investor interest in the US-based ETH ETFs seems to be losing momentum. Spot ETH ETFs Snap 18-Day Positive Inflows Streak According to data from SoSoValue, the US-based spot Ethereum ETFs logged a total net outflow of $75.11 million on Friday, December 20. This marked the first time the Ethereum funds would be registering back-to-back negative performances. On Thursday, December 19, the Ethereum exchange-traded funds recorded a total net outflow of $60 million. This single-day performance put an end to the ETH ETF’s 18-day streak of positive inflows and the first negative day in December for the products. Related Reading: XRP Could Be The Altcoin To Recover Quickly, CryptoQuant Analyst Explains Why Surprisingly, BlackRock’s Ethereum Fund (with the ticker ETHA) was the only spot ETF that recorded outflows on Friday. According to market data from SoSoValue, the ETHA exchange-traded fund posted nearly $103.7 million to close the week. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (with the ticker FETH) recorded $12.95 million in net inflow on Friday. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and Mini Trust (ETH) were the only other ETFs that registered positive inflows on the day, with $7.51 million and $8.10 million, respectively. These back-to-back days of negative performances saw a net $135 million flow out of the ETH exchange-traded funds in just two days in the past week. However, the crypto products finished with a weekly total net inflow — for the fourth consecutive week — of $62.73 million. Similarly, the spot Bitcoin ETFs appear to be losing interest from investors, as most funds recorded outflows to close the past week. The crypto products registered a daily net outflow of approximately $276 million on Friday. Ethereum Price As of this writing, the Ethereum price stands at around $3,342, reflecting a 2.4% decline in the past 24 hours. Given their impact on the value of ETH, it might be important for the spot ETFs to return to positive inflows if the Ethereum price is to see any relief.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-fires-powell-trumppow-solana-memecoin-will-surge-15000-before-exchange-listing-while-shib-wif-and-pepe-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37964644,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321791,1734868108,Models Show Ethereum Promise Even After This Weeks 12% Decline,"Ethereum’s recent 12% drop has not shaken analysts’ confidence in its long-term potential. Currently trading at $3,38, Ethereum has shown resilience amidst market volatility, supported by trading volumes of $28.68 billion. Despite short-term bearish sentiment, two key models—the Block Subsidy Model and the Mayer Multiple—indicate that Ethereum could still achieve significant growth in this cycle, with price targets ranging from $7,200 to $11,433. Block Subsidy Model Highlights $11,433 Target The Block Subsidy Model evaluates Ethereum’s value relative to its thermocap, or the cost of production. Previous cycles revealed Ethereum’s highs reached multiples of its thermocap—64x in its first cycle and 32x in the second. If this diminishing returns trend continues, the current cycle’s peak is projected at 16x the thermocap. Ethereum Block Subsidy | Credit: Valdrin Tahiri/ Glassnode Currently trading between the 8x and 16x thermocap multiples, Ethereum has historically initiated its steepest growth phase upon breaking above the 8x level. Analysts calculate this level at $5,716, while the 16x multiple sits at $11,433. This model suggests Ethereum has ample room to grow, with the likelihood of setting new all-time highs during this cycle. Mayer Multiple Indicates Expansion Phase The Mayer Multiple tracks Ethereum’s price against its 200-day moving average (MA), using multipliers to identify overbought or oversold conditions. Previous cycles saw Ethereum’s peaks above the 2.4x multiplier and lows below the 0.8x multiplier. Ethereum Mayer Multiple | Credit: Glassnode ETH has already tested the 0.8x level twice during this cycle—in June 2022 and September 2024—mirroring patterns from previous cycles. The current 2.4x multiplier, set at $7,200, acts as a significant milestone. Should Ethereum follow historical trends, this level will serve as a benchmark for a new all-time high. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Short-Term Technical Outlook While long-term growth indicators remain positive, Ethereum ’s short-term outlook faces hurdles. A persistent downward trendline is capping bullish momentum near $3,400. This trendline intersects with a supply zone at $3,500 to $3,555, previously a support level but now acting as resistance. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Immediate support lies at $3,252, with additional levels at $3,097 and $2,940. Breaking above $3,555 could trigger bullish momentum, while a failure to breach this level might lead to further consolidation or declines. The RSI stands at 41, signaling a neutral-to-bearish sentiment. Key Insights: Resistance Levels: $3,555 supply zone and downward trendline limit immediate upside potential. Support Levels: Key support at $3,252, with further safety nets at $3,097 and $2,940. Long-Term Outlook: Models project Ethereum’s peak between $7,200 and $11,433. $BEST Wallet Raises Nearly $5.30M: Time-Sensitive Investment Opportunity Best Wallet is transforming the Web3 space by supporting thousands of cryptocurrencies across 50+ major blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

A large section is criticizing the move, saying that it undermines the ethos of cryptocurrency. With the debit card, users can spend directly from their Metamask wallets, simplifying crypto transactions. They can convert their crypto into fiat currency in real-time as they transact through Linea, a speedy layer-2 network from Ethereum. Disgruntled crypto stakeholders raise concerns The launch of the Metamask debit cards has raised serious concerns among crypto users . They argue that the card’s structure negates decentralization and financial freedom, key pillars of cryptocurrency. According to disgruntled crypto users, the card will box its users to traditional banking systems. Muna O., a crypto purist, asked, “Wasn’t the whole ethos of crypto to provide an alternative system to fiat?” while highlighting the contradiction. The partnership with Mastercard is seen as an attempt to undermine the autonomy on which cryptocurrency is premised. There are also concerns about security, more so with centralized systems. Johana Castellanos, a blockchain analyst, called for sophisticated security measures rather than relying on what is currently there. Johana pointed out that Metamask’s wallet has endured frequent attacks. The cost associated with the debit card has also been mentioned. There are fears that the percentage swap fee might be high, around 6 to 9%. Because the card will be unregulated, it will attract juicy fees for Metamask and Mastercard to reap while hurting the users, contrary to the promise of crypto. Metamask and Mastercard have high hopes for pilot program The rollout of the card in the US follows earlier rollouts in the EU, UK, Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia with eligible currencies including USDC, USDT, and WETH. The Metamask card was promoted as a way to avoid the hustle of transferring cryptocurrency to a bank or centralized exchange before spending. The partnering entities argue that the card will boost the public adoption of cryptocurrency. On one hand, Metamask has robust security features to ensure the card is tamper-proof and difficult to hack. On the other, Mastercard has a wide merchant network, giving the card fast, cheaper and secure spending. Lorenzo Santos, Senior Product Manager at Consensys said, “ Metamask card pilot gives people more freedom to spend crypto. Metamask card represents a major step to removing the friction that has traditionally existed between the blockchain and real-world commerce.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",NEGATIVE,USDT | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | USDT | WALLET | USDC,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/metamask-mastercard-crypto-card-backlash/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37963872.jpeg
37963618,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52853,1734867186,Ripple Abruptly Moved 50 Million XRP. Here’s the Destination,"Whale Alert, a prominent platform that monitors significant cryptocurrency transactions, recently reported a large transfer of 50 million XRP. According to the tweet, the transaction—equivalent to $111,697,462 at the time of reporting—was sent from Ripple’s wallet to an unidentified recipient. This transaction has sparked considerable discussion within the cryptocurrency community, with speculation ranging from regulatory settlements to speculative alliances. Details of the Transaction The reported transfer involved 50 million XRP, a significant amount even by Ripple’s standards. Such large-scale transactions often attract attention due to their potential implications on market dynamics and investor sentiment. While the identity of the receiving wallet remains unknown, the movement of funds by Ripple has raised questions regarding the purpose and potential recipients of the transaction. XRP Community Reactions The XRP community has not been shy about expressing opinions on the transaction. Some community members on Twitter, such as @Xrp_goat, speculated that the transfer could be related to legal proceedings. “Ripple just paid the SEC,” they stated , referencing the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over whether XRP should be classified as a security. Another user, @Theannointedone, speculated that the funds might be directed toward former U.S. President Donald Trump, stating , “Right to Mr. Donald Trump.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s History with Large Transactions Ripple is no stranger to high-value transactions. The firm occasionally moves large amounts of XRP to fund operations and provide liquidity to its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) partners, or distribute tokens to strategic stakeholders. However, the lack of transparency regarding the recipient in this particular transaction has left room for debate and speculation. Market Impact At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.29, with a 1.09% price decrease over the last 24 hours. While large transactions like this often raise concerns about potential sell-offs, there is no direct evidence linking this transfer to market movements. However, investors and traders remain cautious, as significant transfers from Ripple’s wallets are sometimes perceived as signals of impending market activity. A s Ripple continues its activities amid regulatory challenges and market volatility, such high-profile transactions will likely remain a focal point for investors and analysts.

37963462,https://finbold.com/?p=221625,1734867175,"Why Bitcoin’s ‘red-hot run’ could correct to ‘$20,000 over the next few weeks’","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price movement correlation with the global money supply (M2) is signaling a possible massive correction for the asset as it seeks to breach the six-figure valuation mark. This relationship hints that Bitcoin could experience a steep drop to $20,000, an almost 80% plunge from its current valuation, according to an analysis by financial commentary platform The Kobeissi Letter in an X post on December 21. Historically, Bitcoin prices have exhibited a lagged correlation with the global money supply, typically trailing by approximately 10 weeks. The entity stated that this trend aligns with the recent peak in the supply, which hit a record $108.5 trillion in October before falling by $4.1 trillion to $104.4 trillion as of December, the lowest level since August. Bitcoin and Global money supply correlation chart. Source: Joe Consorti Notably, the decline coincides with Bitcoin’s recent retreat, which saw the cryptocurrency face the threat of plunging below $90,000 . “If the relationship still holds, this suggests that Bitcoin prices could fall as much as $20,000 over the next few weeks. Bitcoin’s red-hot run may take a pause,” the platform noted. The analysis noted that Bitcoin’s valuation may decline if this historical relationship persists. Fate of Bitcoin price correlation with M2 At the same time, in an X post on December 18, Bitcoin custody firm Theya’s head of growth, Joe Consorti, noted that investors should anticipate two possible outcomes with the two continuing to show correlation. Consorti suggested Bitcoin could decouple from this pattern, driven by strong demand within its ecosystem. He also warned that tightening liquidity could lead to a deep mid-cycle correction if the correlation persists. Elsewhere, Jamie Coutts, chief crypto analyst at Real Vision , highlighted Bitcoin’s correlation with global money supply as a key indicator of its future trajectory. In a late November post on X, Coutts projected the M2 money supply to exceed $127 trillion by 2025, an 18% increase driven by economic and monetary factors. He noted that Bitcoin has historically absorbed about 10% of new liquidity, suggesting the cryptocurrency could see substantial inflows during this period. Global money supply chart. Source: Jamie Coutts However, not all market players believe the M2 correlation with Bitcoin will dictate the digital currency’s price movement. An X user with the pseudonym CryptoAnarchyst argued that the money supply is no longer a key indicator for Bitcoin, as the market has shifted from retail-driven to institutional and derivative-led. The user stated that with the rise of exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ), retirement funds, and corporations, the focus has moved away from traditional liquidity measures, and relying on M2 could lead to poor decision-making in the current market. Sooner you guys realize that M2 no longer matters, better is going to be for you guys. M2 mattered when the market was mostly direct retail driven. People had to have cash on hand to invest in Bitcoin… since ETFs came in, now retirement funds, corporations, derivatives, and… — 🇭🇷CryptoAnarchyst📈🚀🌚 (@CryptoAnarchyst) December 21, 2024 Correlation between global money supply and risk assets The global M2 supply measures total liquidity in the economy, including checking and savings accounts and other assets easily converted into cash. When global liquidity increases, central banks inject more money into the system by lowering interest rates or using quantitative easing, such as buying government bonds , often boosting investment in risk assets like Bitcoin. On the other hand, when liquidity contracts, risk assets like Bitcoin typically face downward pressure. Bitcoin’s fixed supply also makes it appealing as an alternative to central bank systems, further tying its price to changes in global liquidity. Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin was trading at $97,013 at press time, with daily losses of over 1%. On the weekly chart, BTC is down over 5%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At the current valuation, Bitcoin’s technical setup suggests that the asset is facing bullish sentiment both in the long and short term. This is backed by BTC trading above the 50-day simple moving average ($91,748) and the 200-day SMA ($70,040). Looking ahead, Bitcoin is facing major resistance at $100,000 for a chance to clinch another record high, with $95,000 serving as a strong support level worth watching in the short term.

From the victory of Donald Trump to the mass adoption of this technology by the world’s makers, the cryptocurrency market is making a significant impact each day. Moreover, with the market shifting from Bitcoin season to the altcoin season, the volatility in the crypto space has skyrocketed during December 2024. With top altcoins crossing the beyond-affordability level, the crypto market has many undervalued gems. CoinPedia’s expert panel has dedicated itself to finding such gems. Reportedly, these tokens are much easier to invest in and have a high possibility of experiencing a meteoric rise in a short period. Gala (GALA) The gem of the Web3 ecosystem, the Gala project is a standard Layer-1 application. With a motive to empower the gaming industry, this ecosystem has dedicated itself to becoming the first billion-user application in the world of blockchain. TradingView: GALA/USDT Despite recording a negative price action over the past few days, the Gala token has maintained a strong bullish price action in the longer time frame. This makes it a fundamentally strong project. With a highly anticipated altseason in 2025, the Gala price could retest its major resistance level of $0.30, making it a potential 8X project for the upcoming time. Bonk (BONK) One of the best-performing memecoins of the Solana ecosystem, the Bonk price continues to play a vital role. By trading at a discount of ~50% from its ATH of $0.00005916, the BONK memecoin is currently undergoing a bearish price action. TradingView: BONK/USDT However, considering the historic price rise, this memecoin has always achieved a new all-time high during the altcoin market after recording a major price correction during the Bitcoin season. The BONK coin price may achieve a new high during the upcoming crypto bull run. This makes this project a top pick for this list. Jasmy Coin (JASMY) Built on the Ethereum ecosystem, the Jasmy Coin is a project based on the Internet of Things, a Tokyo-based provider. To restore and protect individual data by combining IoT technology with blockchain technology and giving its users full control over their personal information, the JASMY price has significant attention. TradingView: JASMY/USDT By constantly recording a higher high, Jasmy Coin’s price has formed a strong bullish price action in the weekly time frame. This highlights a high possibility of this crypto project heading toward its target price of $0.10. Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) This crypto project is the leading community memecoin on the BNB chain. Notably, the Baby Doge was created as a joke to help spread awareness of animal adoption. By giving more than £81,000 worth of dog food, BabyDoge is the only meme with an official world record for saving dogs. TradingView: BABYDOGE/USDT Notably, this meme coin has been highly volatile since its inception, highlighting a strong price action for it in the crypto space. With a successful listing on the top cryptocurrency exchanges around the globe, the BABYDOGE price is highly undervalued at this point. With a potential surge, this project may cut 1 – 2 zeros this bull run. Shiba Inu (SHIB) The second largest memecoin by market capitalization, the SHIB price has regained momentum by adding over 130% in 2024. With the SHIB burn program, this memecoin eyes to achieve a new high this AltSeason. TradingView: SHIB/USDT The MACD indicator continues recording a bullish price action despite the ongoing memecoin market correction. However, the Shiba Inu price is currently trading at a discount of 72.39% from its ATH of $0.00008845, making it a potential token for the top 10 list. Reserve Rights (RSR) Built as an “ERC-20” token, the Reserve protocol serves two main purposes, staking and governance. Notably, the Reserve Rights (RSR) token was launched in May 2019 after the successful Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) on the Huobi Prime cryptocurrency platform. TradingView: RSR/USDT The technical indicators are recording an increase in volatility. This indicates a rise in the buying and selling pressure for this altcoin. Notably, in the longer time frame, a bullish rise can be recorded, highlighting a positive outlook. An increase in the adoption process of the Ethereum ecosystem could push the value of this ERC-20 token toward a new ATH during 2025. Under an optimistic outlook, the Reserve Rights price may reach as high as $0.05 if the market favors the bulls. Flare (FLR) Built as an EVM-based layer 1 project, it aims to make blockchain more efficient by giving developers decentralized access to high-integrity data across various chains. Moreover, with a monetization model, its native token FLR acts as a mode of payment. TradingView: FLR/USDT Taking into consideration a strong bullish reversal, the Flare price may hit a new high. Notably, the altcoin could surpass its present ATH of $0.0797 and head toward its prolonged price target of $0.10. BitTorrent (BTT) BitTorrent is a popular peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing platform with a decentralized application. Launched in July 2001, BitTorrent was purchased by blockchain platform TRON in July 2018. Following this, BTT was launched on the TRON blockchain, using its TRC-10 application. TradingView: BTT/USDT With the growing cryptocurrency space, the altcoin market could gain significant traction in the coming months. This could result in the BTT coin price heading toward a new all-time high in 2025. Mode (MODE) Mode cryptocurrency project is a modular Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Layer-2 project. The primary task of this project is to use the OP stack and part of the Optimism superchain. Further, it is used to foster the growth and adoption of blockchain applications.

The notice stems from allegations of tax fraud and physical assault, marking the latest chapter in a series of legal battles surrounding the controversial crypto figure. Allegations of Assault and Tax Evasion Finnish authorities are pursuing Richard Schueler for allegedly assaulting a 16-year-old and evading taxes over a four-year period, from June 2020 to April 2024. The European most-wanted fugitives list claims that Schueler physically attacked the minor by dragging them by their hair, knocking them to the ground in a stairwell. The Red Notice, issued globally, does not constitute an international arrest warrant but enables law enforcement to locate and provisionally detain Schueler. This development comes three months after Finnish authorities initially issued a remand order on September 13. Detective Harri Saaristola of Helsinki Police disclosed to Finnish broadcaster Yle that discrepancies in Schueler’s reported income raised red flags. Despite the allegations, Richard Schueler has remained publicly silent on the matter, continuing his social media activity with cryptic remarks. On December 21, he posted on X: “If the haters really wanted to get me down, they could raise more than the $27M I did for medical research.” SEC Lawsuit Adds to Mounting Legal Pressure Beyond the Interpol notice, Schueler is embroiled in a $1 billion lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulator accuses him of conducting unregistered offerings of three cryptocurrencies: Hex, PulseChain (PLS), and PulseX (PSLX). According to the SEC, Richard Schueler raised over $1 billion through these offerings, promoting them as a path to extraordinary wealth for investors. In August, Schueler sought to dismiss the lawsuit, but the SEC pushed back, asserting its authority to pursue the case. The mounting legal challenges are casting a shadow over Schueler’s crypto ventures, which once garnered attention for their audacious promises of financial independence. However, critics have long questioned the legitimacy of Hex and its associated projects, further intensifying scrutiny.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin began in 2013 as a playful twist on the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the lovable Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no cap on the total number. What started as a joke quickly gained a following, showcasing the power of community and social media in driving interest. In 2021, Dogecoin captured global attention as its value skyrocketed. Fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from personalities like Elon Musk, it surged into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, exceeding $50 billion. Technologically, Dogecoin offers faster transaction times and lower fees compared to some of its peers, making it appealing for everyday use. As the crypto market evolves, Dogecoin remains notable for its strong community support and widespread recognition. While its abundant supply contrasts with the scarcity of coins like Bitcoin, its accessibility and enthusiastic following keep it in the conversation amid current market trends. Conclusion Dogecoin, PEPE, and MOG have shown great potential, but XYZVerse stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, uniting sports fans and aiming for massive growth.

Schiff suggested creating a new cryptocurrency to replace the Bitcoin strategic reserve, calling it USAcoin. He argued that the US could save a lot of money this way. Peter Schiff argued that this coin should be limited to a maximum supply of 21 million coins like Bitcoin. However, he suggested that BTC failed in payments, so the new coin could be made applicable to payments with an updated blockchain. In this way, he expressed with irony that everyone in the US could become rich. Related News: BREAKING: Founder of This Altcoin Added to Interpol's Most Wanted List Schiff, who also took a humorous approach, suggested that the logo of the coin he proposed should include the new President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Elon Musk, who is expected to have a great influence on the administration.

37962610,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631349,1734865200,"Cardano (ADA) vs Lightchain AI Which Altcoin Could Turn $100 into $10,000 if You HODL for Just 3 Months?","For crypto enthusiasts chasing big gains, the question often comes down to identifying which altcoin can multiply their investment the fastest. Two contenders have recently caught the spotlight Cardano (ADA), a well-established blockchain focused on research-driven development, and Lightchain AI (LCAI) , a newcomer blending artificial intelligence with blockchain at a rock-bottom presale price of $0.003. Which of these two stands a better chance of turning $100 into $10,000 within just three months? Let’s compare their technology, growth potential, and market positioning to see which one could deliver astronomical returns in a short time frame. Cardano (ADA) Steady Climber with Strong Fundamentals Cardano, often praised as a first-rate blockchain spot, is famous for its peer-checked way, Proof of Stake (PoS) agreement and promise to growth and long lasting. These traits have made it a key part of the crypto world, pulling in backers who care about long-term safety and careful growth. Though Cardano is a trustworthy and good project, its slow rise and bi͏gger market cap make quick short-term wins less likely. In good market times, getting 2x or 3x back in a few months can happen, but making a 100x jump (changing $100 to $10,000) in just three months is very unlikely. Cardano’s slow speed works well for those who keep it long-term, but it’s not made for fast gains in little time. Lightchain AI (LCAI) AI-Powered Underdog with Massive Upside Lightchain AI is an exciting new project that’s taking things to the next level by integrating AI directly into its blockchain infrastructure. With its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), developers can create AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) that solve real-world issues in industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. But what really sets it apart is its revolutionary Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus, which rewards users for meaningful AI computations instead of just staking or mining. Now, let’s talk about the entry price and growth potential. During its presale, LCAI is priced at just $0.003—a ridiculously low starting point. Even a modest jump to $0.30 would mean a 100x return, taking a $100 investment and turning it into $10,000. With its cutting-edge technology and deflationary tokenomics (burning a portion of transaction fees), analysts and insiders are excited about where this token could go, especially with milestones like the testnet and mainnet launches on the horizon. Of course, no gains are ever guaranteed, but with its low market cap, innovative features, and tiny starting price, LCAI has a much better chance at short-term growth compared to larger tokens like Cardano. It’s worth keeping an eye on! Risk vs. Reward Which One Offers a Better Short-Term Bet? Cardano (ADA) offers several advantages, including stable and proven technology, a large community, and a well-regarded team. However, its large market cap and slower organic growth make it less likely to deliver extraordinary short-term gains, such as 100x returns within three months. On the other hand, Lightchain AI (LCAI) presents an entirely different opportunity. With an extremely low entry price, groundbreaking AI integration, deflationary tokenomics, and massive upside potential, LCAI appeals to those seeking high-risk, high-reward investments. That said, it comes with challenges as an early-stage project, including higher risk and a less established community and ecosystem. For short-term speculators aiming to turn $100 into $10,000 in just three months, Lightchain AI’s risk-reward profile is more compelling. While such dramatic growth is far from guaranteed, LCAI’s low price, innovative technology, and potentially explosive narrative make it well-suited to attract market enthusiasm and rapid price appreciation. Smart Short-Term Play Cardano remains a stellar option for long-term investors who value security and steady progress. However, if your goal is to chase exponential gains in a short timeframe, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is the altcoin to watch. Its combination of innovative AI-blockchain fusion, ultra-low presale price , and deflationary model offers a rare opportunity for extraordinary returns—potentially turning $100 into $10,000 faster than almost any established cryptocurrency on the market today. As always, high potential reward comes with higher risk. Do your due diligence, and only invest what you can afford to lose. But for those ready to embrace the next big trend and potentially reap life-changing returns, LCAI may be the ideal pick for the upcoming bull run.

37962431,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631850,1734864887,Afghanistan’s Taliban actively trades crypto memecoins despite imposing nationwide ban,"The Taliban, known for its toxic interpretation of Islamic law and rigid governance, officially banned crypto, labeling it “haram.” But it seems they’ve been quietly dabbling in them too. In one of the more bizarre twists of Afghanistan’s post-2021 collapse, these guys are reportedly trading memecoins, specifically Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), proving that hypocrisy and hustle know no bounds. Afghanistan’s economy has been a disaster since the Taliban took over in August 2021. With $7 billion in central bank reserves frozen by the U.S. and international sanctions isolating the country, the financial system is a shadow of its former self. Banks barely function, and liquidity is almost non-existent. Afghans turned to crypto as an alternative, but by 2024, the Taliban banned it outright. Taliban trades Shiba Inu and Dogecoin while enforcing crypto bans In the documentary, one Taliban member admitted to profiting from SHIB but complained he lost it all by “buying high and selling low.” Another bragged about his Dogecoin flips. The Taliban’s social media nickname, “Talibros,” captures this contradiction. While the group cracks down on crypto for ordinary citizens, its members allegedly trade it under the radar. This duality has raised eyebrows globally, exposing the gap between what they preach and what they do. Afghanistan ranked 20th on Chainalysis’s Crypto Adoption Index in 2021, largely because crypto provided a way for citizens to survive amid the economic collapse. By press time though, the country’s rank has tanked. The Taliban’s ban destroyed local crypto activity, shutting down exchanges and arresting traders. Crypto c rackdown wrecks Afghanistan’s financial lifeline In the beginning, cryptos were tolerated because they allowed Afghans to bypass banking restrictions and sanctions. Families used crypto wallets to receive remittances, while local apps like HesabPay flourished. This stopped once the Taliban decided crypto was apparently out of step with Islamic finance principles, though there is nothing anywhere that proves that and the claim itself makes no sense. In mid-2024, the Taliban shut down at least 16 exchanges in the Herat province, arresting operators and confiscating funds. Traders were labeled criminals, and the government insisted crypto trading was forbidden. Officials claimed cryptocurrencies facilitated gambling and scams, which they said hurt everyday Afghans. The central bank called crypto “haram,” but critics argue the Taliban’s true motivation was control. Decentralized currencies threaten the Taliban’s grip on Afghanistan’s fragile economy. As for the citizens, the impact has been brutal. All signs point to an even worse economic situation next year. Weirdly enough, the Taliban has also been getting pretty chummy with Russia’s President, Vlad Putin. As we reported before, they asked him for an invitation to the October BRICS annual summit he hosted in Kazan. He didn’t comply, but reports now say he has partnered with them to “fight against terrorism.” Ironically, Putin has also removed them from his country’s list of terrorists. Some economists believe the Taliban might even try to get Afghanistan to join the BRICS, even if it is as a partner country. It remains to be seen how member, specifically China and India will would react to that. Russia seems down though.

The Interpol issued a ‘Red Notice’ for Richard Heart whose real name is Richard Hurler. According to the details, Heart is declared wanted for allegedly committing tax fraud and assault. A red notice implies that a person is provisionally declared wanted globally, meaning law enforcement can locate and arrest the person. In Heart’s case, he is a person of interest in Finland, with authorities actively looking for him. However, the Red Notice does not automatically translate into an international arrest warrant. Heart was also listed on the most wanted fugitive list, where he is being sought after to answer for the same allegations. Hex founder wanted on allegations of tax evasion and assault Europe’s most wanted website shared the details of the allegations against Richard Heart. According to the website , the Hex founder’s assault case involves a 16-year-old girl. Heart was said to have dragged the girl by her hair into a stairwell before knocking her to the ground. The website mentioned that the Hex founder inflicted several bodily harm on the girl, causing her to suffer physical pain. “Schueler physically assaulted a 16-year-old victim by grabbing their hair, dragging them into the stairwell, and knocking them to the ground. While the victim was lying on their back on the floor, Schueler punched them 4 – 5 times in the face, nose, eyes and head area,” the website read. The report also revealed that the victim was left on the spot with various degrees of bodily harm, including broken facial skin, bleeding, and swelling in several areas. In addition, the victim’s clothes were covered in blood, detailing the extent of the harm caused by Heart. Also, the Hex founder allegedly committed tax fraud, failing to observe a mandatory duty that was important in assessing his taxes. The report claimed that Heart received income from his business but failed to file taxes for multiple years. “Schueler failed to file business tax returns for the tax multiple years and also failed to complete information on his income on his pre-filled personal tax returns. Schueler received income from his business or income-generating activities that he should have declared to the Tax Administration for tax assessment,” the report said. The report further revealed that the Hex founder avoided hundreds of millions in taxes between June 2020 and April 2024. The Red Notice comes three months after Finnish authorities released an order to remand him. According to a detective in Helsinki, Heart’s income reporting did not match the estimates of the tax service. Heart has remained active on social media.

The regulator took him to court over the alleged offering of three unregistered products, Hex, PulseChain (PLS), and Pulse (PLSX). Although the Hex founder had previously asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed, the SEC claimed it had the authority to act. According to the SEC, Heart raised more than $1 billion through the sale of unregistered crypto products. The complaint mentioned that Heart told investors that the tokens would provide a way for them to achieve wealth. With Heart still embroiled in the SEC’s legal tussle and his issues with the Red Notice, it could only be a matter of time before he is apprehended.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/daddy-pepe-daddpepe-solana-memecoin-will-explode-11000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

This price action has left traders and investors questioning the next direction for ETH as it consolidates under critical resistance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Test ATH Once It Breaks This Strong Supply Zone – Details Despite the turbulence, on-chain data suggests a potentially bullish outlook. Analyst Ali Martinez shared insightful metrics showing that Ethereum whales have been accumulating heavily during this period of uncertainty. According to the data, whales purchased 340,000 ETH—worth over $1 billion—in the last 96 hours. This significant accumulation indicates that major players see long-term value in Ethereum, even as short-term market sentiment remains mixed. The ongoing whale activity could signal an upcoming recovery for ETH, with large holders positioning themselves for future gains. Historically, such accumulation phases have often preceded strong rallies, as increased demand and reduced supply contribute to upward momentum. Ethereum Whale Demand Keeps Rising Ethereum demand has shown significant instability throughout the year, with persistent selling pressure pushing prices down from local highs. Each rally attempt has faced resistance, highlighting the challenges ETH has encountered in sustaining upward momentum. Despite this, Ethereum continues to demonstrate resilience, particularly during corrective phases, as large holders actively accumulate ETH. Martinez recently shared compelling data on X, indicating a remarkable whale accumulation trend. In the past 96 hours alone, whales have purchased 340,000 Ethereum, valued at over $1 billion. This substantial buying activity underscores the confidence that major players have in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Such accumulation often signals the possibility of a market shift, with whales strategically positioning themselves ahead of a potential breakout. Martinez and other analysts believe this whale-driven demand hints at a significant price surge in the weeks to come. Furthermore, the broader crypto community anticipates Ethereum playing a pivotal role in the expected altseason next year, solidifying its position as a market leader among altcoins. Related Reading: XRP Holds Key Demand Level – Whale Activity Suggests Strength As Ethereum enters this critical phase, market participants will closely monitor its ability to capitalize on the current accumulation. If whale activity continues, it could pave the way for Ethereum to reclaim local highs and potentially set new milestones, reinforcing its dominance in the crypto space. ETH Holding Key Support Ethereum is currently trading at $3,320, showing resilience after holding above the critical 200-day moving average (MA) at $3,000. This level is widely regarded as a key indicator of long-term market strength. Holding above it suggests that Ethereum remains in a bullish structure despite recent volatility and selling pressure. For Ethereum to regain momentum, bulls will need to push the price above the $3,550 resistance level and maintain it. Breaking this zone would signal a renewed upward trend and increase the likelihood of Ethereum testing higher levels. However, this may not happen immediately, as the market could enter a period of sideways consolidation.

These posts are often accompanied by convincing visuals and elaborate captions for legitimacy. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Garlinghouse has previously criticized platforms like YouTube and X for failing to address the proliferation of cryptocurrency scams. His frustration resonates with the broader crypto community, which continues to struggle with a surge in fraudulent activities across various social media platforms. The scam’s message claims that Ripple intends to distribute 100 million XRP to investors because of RLUSD’s launch, and promises rewards to loyal participants. Such posts are designed to exploit the excitement surrounding legitimate developments in Ripple’s ecosystem, preying on users who may not exercise sufficient caution when engaging with these posts. Amelie emphasized the importance of vigilance in her post. Her comments serve as a critical reminder to the community to remain skeptical of offers that seem too good to be true. She noted that no one was giving out free XRP, as the desire to earn profit without investing often drives people to fall for these scams. How to Stay Safe in the Crypto Market To protect yourself from falling victim to such schemes, it is crucial to verify the authenticity of any promotional offers.

The new additions include former Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks , Jane Dietze of Galaxy Digital, and Gregg Winiarski from Fanatics Holdings. The appointments, revealed in a December 20 SEC filing , come as the company gears up for its inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 Index on December 23. Brian Brooks Role Sparks Excitement The crypto community believes that Brian Brooks’ addition to MicroStrategy’s board is a major move for the firm. Brooks, who briefly served as CEO of Binance.US in 2021 and was previously the Acting Comptroller of the Currency, brings deep regulatory and strategic expertise to the table. Bitcoin-focused platform Swan Bitcoin called Brooks’ appointment a “BIG deal,” noting his extensive connections within the U.S. banking system. Meanwhile, crypto analyst MacroScope stated the strength of all three appointments, particularly Brooks, whose name has recently circulated as a potential candidate to replace Gary Gensler as SEC Chair under a pro-crypto administration. Dietze and Winiarski also bring notable credentials. Dietze, currently on Galaxy Digital’s board, adds investment acumen, while Winiarski, Chief Legal Officer at Fanatics Holdings, brings extensive legal expertise to MicroStrategy’s operations. MicroStrategy’s Growing Influence These appointments coincide with MicroStrategy’s impending addition to the Nasdaq 100 Index , a landmark achievement that underscores the company’s growing stature. Nasdaq confirmed that MicroStrategy (MSTR) will join Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise as new entrants to the index, replacing firms like Illumina and Moderna. Being listed on the Nasdaq 100 solidifies MicroStrategy’s position among the largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. The move also reflects the company’s transition from a software enterprise to a Bitcoin-heavy investment vehicle, driven by founder Michael Saylor’s bullish stance on the cryptocurrency. This development caps off a year of strategic milestones for MicroStrategy. With its Bitcoin holdings exceeding $5 billion , the company’s influence extends beyond the corporate world, reshaping narratives around Bitcoin adoption.

37961523,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631835,1734862766,Is Elon Musk backing Trump’s economic policies solely for his personal interests?,"The United States government barely avoided a shutdown yesterday, but the chaos wasn’t just politics as usual. At the center of it all was Elon Musk. The billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX is now as much a political disruptor as he is a tech icon. His deep-pocketed support for President Donald Trump and his economic policies has turned him into an unelected power broker, and people are wondering: is this billionaire’s game about helping America or protecting his own empire at the expense of the economy? Elon has thrown a fat $277 million behind Trump and his Republican allies. $239 million of that was funneled through Elon’s America PAC, making him the largest donor of the 2024 election cycle. For a man who once claimed he wouldn’t support either candidate, Elon didn’t just flip, he went all in. By August, he was rallying voters at Trump campaign events, calling the election “the most important of your lifetime” and urging his hundreds of millions of followers to act. According to him, his breaking point was the Democrat-originating WOKE culture. Elon’s role in Trump’s economic revolution Trump’s economic policies are as divisive as his tweets, and Elon’s fingerprints are all over them. Let’s talk about tariffs. Trump wants to slap 10% to 20% import taxes to boost American manufacturing. He also wants to hit BRICS countries with 100% tariffs if they dare abandon the US dollar. Sounds patriotic, right? Well economists are not impressed. They predict that these tariffs will drive up consumer prices without creating the jobs Trump promises. Then there’s the immigration plan: mass deportation. Trump wants millions of undocumented immigrants out. Critics say this will cause labor shortages in critical industries like agriculture and construction, where immigrants are the backbone. And here’s where Elon officially steps into the policy arena. Trump has proposed the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), a $500 billion federal spending-cut machine. Elon is set to lead it. This initiative aims to slash federal spending by identifying and axing what Elon sees as wasteful programs. That’s $2 trillion over four years. But here’s the catch: those cuts will amputate services millions of Americans depend on. Even Elon admits this won’t be easy. He has acknowledged “temporary hardship” for Americans during this economic reset. But what’s hardship for the guy with hundreds of billions of dollars? Because for families living paycheck to paycheck, it’s rising prices, fewer jobs, and shredded safety nets. Retailers have already warned of price hikes thanks to those tariffs. Deportations could cripple supply chains. And cutting federal spending by billions is gonna be public services, housing programs, and food aid on the chopping block. Elon’s motives: Public service or self-service? Let’s not pretend Elon is just a well-meaning billionaire trying to save America. Though he is a decent person, this is also about power and revenge for him. He’s been violated many times by the Oval before, and that must’ve been hurtful. It is fair to assume he has gotten just a tad vindictive, and perhaps petty too. You see, Elon’s alignment with Trump gives him access — real, tangible access — to federal contracts, regulations, and influence that could supercharge his companies. SpaceX, Tesla , and his other ventures thrive on government contracts. With Elon leading the efficiency commission, he’s essentially got a direct line to control federal spending priorities. Who needs a lobbyist when you’re the one holding the purse strings? Some Democratic Senators say Vice President-elect J.D. Vance is going to be pretty much useless. They think it’ll be Elon in the Oval making all the decisions while Trump “yes and”s him. And this guy doesn’t just play behind closed doors. He uses his platform—literally his platform, X (formerly Twitter)—to drive his agenda. It’s no secret that he has ramped up his numbers of tweets in a day since his buddy won the election. At one point, Elon posted over 150 times in a single day, derailing the bipartisan government funding bill. Elon’s posts included more than once inaccuracies, like claiming the bill gave lawmakers a 40% pay raise and funded a $3 billion stadium in D.C. You can go through the bill yourself and see that none of that was true. But by the time fact-checkers caught up, it was already dead. “This bill should not pass,” Elon wrote. Twelve hours later, it didn’t. He celebrated, tweeting, “The voice of the people has triumphed!” But was it really the people, Elon? The bill wasn’t even public then. Why was Elon so invested in killing that bill? Well, as it turns out, buried in the legislation was a provision targeting tech transactions involving China. And guess what? Elon has deep business ties in China . The original bill would’ve cost him money. We can’t say how much though. Anti-crypto and Wall Street critic Senator Elizabeth Warren summed it up in an open letter to Trump: “The American public has no way of knowing whether the advice Elon is whispering in secret is good for the country—or just good for his own bottom line.” Washington’s newest power couple Trump and Elon are reshaping power in America. Trump gives Elon legitimacy. Elon gives Trump money, reach, and a level of influence no other billionaire can match. Together, they’re a force. And they’ll probably change the world, starting with that national Bitcoin strategic reserve . And then fixing all of the economic bridges Joe Biden burned, like Russia and China. Elon’s billions and his platform make him untouchable in a way no one else in Trump’s circle is. Cabinet secretaries can be replaced. Advisors can be sidelined. But Elon? He’s too big to fail, too connected to ignore, and too rich to challenge. Republicans joke about Elon as the next Speaker of the House, but the truth is, he doesn’t need the title. That’d be like a demotion to him now.

In a new interview with Bloomberg, Hougan says that institutional money is in the early stages of broadening out to other crypto assets besides just Bitcoin ( BTC ). Hougan forecasts that 2025 will be the year that institutional investors will begin to incorporate more diversification in their crypto-investing strategies the same way they do in other asset classes like equities or bonds. “You’re already seeing it broaden out actually. A lot of people were worried about the Ethereum ETFs for instance, which launched this summer and had tepid inflows. But over the last month or so, you’ve seen billions of dollars flow into those products. Again, the things that have happened in crypto in the past keep happening. Historically, most people enter crypto through Bitcoin, and then they discover Ethereum, and then they think about Solana. There’s no reason to assume that the institutions that came into Bitcoin won’t move on to other assets in the future. In fact, I think in 2025, you’re going to see an explosion of interest in index space strategies that give diversified exposure to crypto. Of course, [that is] something we’ve been doing at Bitwise since 2017 when we pioneered that concept. I think 2025 is when that becomes a mainstream way to allocate to this space, the same way it is to stocks and bonds and real estate and everything else.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Analysts believe this token has what it takes to leave Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano price in the dust, making it the breakout star of the market. With such explosive potential while selling out massively in the presale market at a low cost, investors should rush to secure WLTQ before it sells out. Wall Street Analysts Predict 30,000% Rally For WallitIQ (WLTQ), Surpassing Rivals WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale draws Wall Street analysts, who predict a massive 30,000% rally in 14 days to outperform Shiba Inu (SHIB) and the Cardano price. As a next-generation DeFi wallet, WallitIQ (WLTQ) focuses on security and efficiency, making it a strong competitor to Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA). Investors are rushing to secure WLTQ tokens at a discounted $0.0243 , the lowest price available during its presale.

Qubetics Could Be December’s Most Rewarding Choice,"Fantom made headlines with its cutting-edge technology and solutions for smart contracts, creating a platform that caught the attention of early investors. Back when its ICO launched, few could have predicted how far it would go. Those who got in early saw their portfolios flourish as Fantom grew into one of the most innovative projects in the blockchain space. But for many, hesitation turned into regret as they watched Fantom’s value rise without them. What if you could avoid that feeling this time around? Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a project that’s stirring up excitement in the crypto world with its ongoing presale. Built to address the gaps that previous blockchains couldn’t fully close, Qubetics is creating a decentralised ecosystem that’s practical, accessible, and full of potential. If you’ve been searching for the next big thing, Qubetics might just be the opportunity to turn things around. Qubetics Presale Is Your Chance to Avoid Missing Out Again If you’ve heard about Qubetics but haven’t taken action yet, here’s what you’ve missed so far. The whitelist opened at a jaw-dropping $0.01, giving early participants an exclusive entry point. As the presale progressed through its initial stages, prices remained incredibly competitive, rewarding those who acted quickly.

And for developers, the code snippet library saves time by offering pre-built solutions for common tasks. Whether you’re a business, a freelancer, or a tech enthusiast, Qubetics is removing barriers and unlocking new possibilities. Fantom’s Journey and What It Means for Your Crypto Strategy Fantom started with the bold goal of creating a high-performance, scalable blockchain. When its ICO launched, tokens were sold at a fraction of what they’re worth today. Early adopters who recognised Fantom’s potential saw their investments multiply as the project gained traction. Fantom’s ability to address real-world problems, like improving the speed and cost-efficiency of transactions, helped it secure partnerships and grow its ecosystem. At its all-time high, Fantom delivered extraordinary returns for early investors. Those who hesitated, however, found themselves either paying more to get in or missing out entirely. Fantom’s story is a reminder of the importance of acting early in the crypto space. While the opportunities aren’t endless, new projects like Qubetics are stepping up, offering a chance to start fresh. Act Now and Be Part of Something Big Missed chances can feel frustrating, but they don’t have to be the end of the road.

37960701,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631615,1734861215,VanEck says strategic Bitcoin reserve could hold up to 35% of US debt by 2050,"Investment manager VanEck has projected that the Bitcoin Reserve, as proposed under Senator Cynthia Lummis’s BITCOIN Act, could hold up to 35% of the US national debt by 2050. This will offset about $42 trillion of the country’s liabilities, it claimed. The VanEck analysis assumes that the national debt will compound by 5% between 2025 and 2049, starting at $37 trillion. This is an optimistic estimate given that the rate over the last ten years has been 10%. It further assumes Bitcoin will compound at 25% annually over the same period from the base of $200,000 in 2025. Source: VanEck Based on this assumption, Bitcoin would be worth $42.3 million by 2049. Thus, if the BITCOIN Act, which proposes that the US have a reserve of one million Bitcoins by 2029, is enacted, the value of the reserve in 2049 would be $42 trillion. However, many have considered the assumption that Bitcoin will have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% over the next 25 years to be highly unlikely. In his response, VanEck’s Head of Research, Matthew Sigel , argued that Bitcoin has actually been growing at a 50% CAGR over the last 10 years. Thus, 25% is a conservative assumption. VanEck’s Head of Research says the Bitcoin acquisition will benefit the US dollar Sigel has now further affirmed his opinion on the benefits of a Bitcoin Reserve for the US. In a recent post countering an article by crypto investor Nic Carter against a Bitcoin Reserve, Sigel noted that now is the best time for the US to have a Bitcoin reserve. He explained that the US debt burden has been the major factor preventing it from having a reserve, but it can now start with Bitcoin to position itself for the future. The analyst noted that Bitcoin can be a complementary asset that will strengthen the US dollar, and the belief of many that the adoption of Bitcoin by the US will undermine the dollar could not be more wrong. He said: “Bitcoin doesn’t have to undermine the dollar. As in an investor portfolio, a small position is simply a hedge against fiscal unsustainability and geopolitical uncertainty, which can strengthen our asset base and impose some discipline on the Central Bank.” Sigel also believes that Carter overestimates how the market will react to the US government acquiring Bitcoin . In his view, there is gradual mainstream adoption and some political will at present; together, these will be enough to lay the foundation for the reserve and build on it with time. Bitcoin reserve will not cost US $1 trillion; can be a gradual process Meanwhile, Sigel also clarified in his post that the Bitcoin reserve will not impose an additional cost burden on the US. Based on VanEck estimates, it will cost the US around $320 billion to own one million BTC. However, he believes that accumulation could be a gradual process, giving the US a first-mover advantage and expanding with time. In the expert’s opinion, such an advantage has strategic benefits for the US government. BTC’s neutrality makes it ideal as a reserve asset and allows the country to retain its leading position in innovative technology, he said. He added that Bitcoin could also benefit the US energy strategy as it incentivizes energy infrastructure development. Sigel said: “Bitcoin mining incentivizes the development of domestic energy infrastructure, including renewables, nuclear, and grid resiliency projects. This aligns with US strategic goals for energy independence and sustainability.” With the two experts arguing for and against Bitcoin, the crypto community remains divided on whether it would be a good idea. Most of those opposing it are concerned it will not benefit the US dollar and might lead to the government taking control of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, the possibility of the US having an SBR is currently limited as the Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the government cannot buy Bitcoin. It remains to be seen whether the next administration can change this position.

With this notable move, Ripple continues to show it fully supports the upcoming crypto-friendly administration. The news was reported on X by Cointelegraph and highlights the president-elect’s ongoing interest in the crypto space, which he demonstrated during his campaign . Donald Trump’s Interest in Crypto Trump’s acceptance of this contribution to XRP is notable for several reasons. It shows the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies among mainstream political figures and signals potential shifts in U.S. regulatory policies under his administration. Trump supported the crypto industry before accepting crypto donations for his campaign. Recently, he nominated Paul Atkins , a known pro-crypto individual, to replace outgoing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 His appointment signals a potential departure from the SEC’s historically cautious stance on digital assets under Gensler. The outgoing SEC chair faced significant criticism from the crypto community for what many perceived as overregulation and a lack of clear guidelines for the industry. Industry leaders view Atkins’ appointment as a positive development that could pave the way for a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. This leadership change at the SEC coincides with Trump’s inauguration on January 20, a day that could mark a turning point for the U.S. crypto industry. There are also rumors that the president-elect plans to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the U.S., fulfilling his promise of making the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. Ripple’s Strategy Ripple’s involvement also reflects its commitment to promoting the adoption and legitimacy of XRP. The company has been actively engaging with policymakers and regulators to shape the future of digital assets. There are reports that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently met with Trump , and this $5 million donation represents a large public endorsement of crypto in a political context. Garlinghouse has been vocal about regulatory reform, advocating for a balanced approach that fosters innovation without stifling growth. The $5 million donation could be a statement of confidence in the incoming administration’s pro-crypto stance. A Milestone for Crypto in Politics The acceptance of cryptocurrency donations at this level marks a milestone for the industry, signaling increased political and institutional recognition of digital assets. Trump’s willingness to accept XRP reflects the growing role of cryptocurrencies in the global economy and their potential to influence policy.

37961201,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321784,1734860907,Jump Crypto Subsidiary Settles with SEC for $123M Over TerraUSD Misrepresentation,"Tai Mo Shan, a subsidiary of Jump Crypto, has agreed to pay $123 million to settle charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegations it misled investors about the stability of TerraUSD (UST), an algorithmic stablecoin that later collapsed. The settlement, announced on December 20 , highlights the SEC’s ongoing scrutiny of stablecoins and their operators. The SEC accused Tai Mo Shan of entering into an agreement with Terraform Labs in 2021 to purchase Terra LUNA at a steep discount. Tai Mo Shan Spent $20M to Help Maintain UST Peg The company also reportedly spent $20 million to help maintain UST’s 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar. “The impact reverberated throughout the crypto markets, eventually costing the savings of countless investors,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler commented. “Regardless of the labels, crypto market participants should comply with the securities laws where applicable and not deceive the public.” UST, once the third-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, collapsed in May 2022, triggering a wave of panic in the cryptocurrency industry. Unlike traditional stablecoins backed by tangible assets, UST used software algorithms and digital collateral to maintain its dollar peg. The system unraveled on May 8, 2022, when a whale dumped $285 million worth of UST, causing the stablecoin to lose its peg and trade at $0.98. By May 10, UST had plunged to $0.67, sparking mass liquidations and panic among investors. The collapse revealed that the reserves of Terra’s underlying token, LUNA, were insufficient to support UST’s market capitalization, leading to the complete devaluation of the stablecoin. The fallout from UST’s failure prompted global regulatory scrutiny of algorithmic stablecoins. In the U.S., it influenced legislation such as the Lummis-Gillibrand Stablecoin Act of 2024, which bans algorithmic stablecoins.

The crypto fallout… pic.twitter.com/jss7anSPyS — Crypto Town Hall (@Crypto_TownHall) December 21, 2024 The collapse also led to a formal investigation of Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon. The company faced a $4.4 billion settlement, marking one of the most significant enforcement actions in the cryptocurrency industry. Fracture Labs Sues Jump Trading Over Alleged ‘Pump and Dump’ Scheme Crypto game developer Fracture Labs has filed a lawsuit against Jump Trading , alleging that the firm manipulated its DIO gaming token through a “pump and dump” scheme. The suit, submitted in October in an Illinois District Court, claimed that Jump Trading, acting as a market maker, breached its agreement to support the DIO token’s initial offering on the crypto exchange HTX (formerly Huobi) in 2021. Fracture Labs asserts that it provided Jump Trading with 10 million DIO tokens, valued at $500,000, to facilitate the token’s launch. Additionally, 6 million DIO tokens, worth approximately $300,000, were transferred to HTX. Following the launch, HTX engaged online influencers to promote DIO, driving its value up to $0.98. At this peak, the tokens Jump held were reportedly valued at $9.8 million. However, Fracture Labs claims that Jump then sold its entire DIO holdings, leading to a “mass liquidation” that saw the token’s price plummet to $0.005.

The software company transformed into a de facto Bitcoin hedge fund in 2020 and continues to champion Bitcoin as a core component of its strategy. The addition of MicroStrategy to the Nasdaq 100 came alongside two other companies, while Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna were removed. The reshuffling of the index reflects its dynamic nature and the growing influence of Bitcoin-focused firms. Saylor Supports Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve As reported, Saylor has expressed strong support for President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Detailed in his “Digital Assets Framework” policy published Friday, the proposal outlines a roadmap for the United States to foster growth in the digital asset industry, establish clear compliance standards, and ensure defined rights for crypto asset holders and companies. Saylor noted the importance of the U.S. leading the global digital economy through innovation in digital assets. “By establishing a clear taxonomy, a legitimate rights-based framework, and practical compliance obligations, the United States can lead the global digital economy,” he wrote. He added that such measures could unlock trillions of dollars in wealth, empower millions of businesses, and secure the U.S. dollar’s status as the cornerstone of the digital financial system. While Saylor did not specify the size of the reserve, he suggested it could create wealth ranging from $16 to $81 trillion, potentially erasing the U.S. national debt of $36 trillion.

37960123,https://coinpaprika.com/news/crypto-giants-back-trump-with-millions-for-inauguration,1734860475,Crypto Giants Back Trump with Millions for Inauguration,"Ripple has pledged $5 million in XRP to support the inauguration events of President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance in January. This donation marks the largest cryptocurrency contribution ever made for a political event. Other major crypto firms, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Ondo Finance, have also committed $1 million each to the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee. These contributions will fund a series of celebrations, including parades, dinners, and exclusive receptions surrounding the January 20th swearing-in ceremony. The donations come with significant benefits for top contributors. Companies or individuals donating $1 million or raising $2 million will receive six tickets to high-profile events. These include exclusive dinners with Trump and Vance, receptions with incoming Cabinet members, and access to other private gatherings. Such opportunities offer crypto leaders a chance to establish direct relationships with the new administration and influence future regulatory policies. The involvement of crypto firms in political funding reflects the sector's growing influence. Earlier this year, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse personally donated $25 million to Fairshake, a pro-crypto super PAC. Collectively, crypto-affiliated PACs have raised over $133 million for political campaigns this cycle. This financial support highlights the industry’s commitment to shaping a favorable regulatory environment in the United States. Meetings between top crypto executives and Trump have already yielded results. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has resigned, and pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins has taken his place. Furthermore, Trump has appointed David Sacks as the first-ever AI and Crypto Czar , signaling a strategic focus on these technologies in his administration. These changes suggest a policy shift that could benefit the cryptocurrency industry over the next four years. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong have also held private discussions with Trump in recent months. Topics included regulatory reforms and key personnel appointments aimed at promoting innovation while ensuring market stability. With the cryptocurrency industry’s increasing political presence, these dialogues are expected to play a vital role in shaping the sector's future. The recent surge in crypto political funding follows a broader trend of integration between digital assets and traditional power structures. Ondo Finance’s donation comes after a significant market boost, with its token reaching an all-time high of $2.14 following a major investment from World Liberty Financial, a Trump-backed project. This financial momentum has reinforced the sector’s credibility in political and economic discussions. Crypto leaders recognize the importance of being part of policymaking processes, especially as regulatory clarity remains a key concern. By supporting Trump’s inauguration and engaging directly with political leaders, companies like Ripple, Coinbase, and Kraken are positioning themselves as influential stakeholders in the U.S. financial landscape. As the cryptocurrency industry gains ground in Washington, Trump’s administration appears ready to embrace digital assets and blockchain technologies. The appointment of key pro-crypto figures, along with significant financial contributions from the industry, signals a potential turning point. The coming years could see the U.S. adopting a more crypto-friendly stance, driven by collaboration between political leaders and industry pioneers.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | ONDO,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/crypto-giants-back-trump-with-millions-for-inauguration,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37960123.jpeg

The notice, requested by Finnish authorities , seeks Schueler’s provisional arrest but does not constitute an international arrest warrant. The Red Notice follows a remand order issued for Schueler on September 13, according to Finnish public broadcaster Yle. Helsinki police detective Harri Saaristola noted discrepancies between Schueler’s reported income and the Finnish tax service’s estimates, raising further concerns about potential financial misconduct. Schueler Also Placed on Europe’s Most Wanted List Schueler has also been placed on Europe’s most wanted fugitives list. According to details shared there, he is accused of assaulting a 16-year-old victim by allegedly grabbing their hair, dragging them into a stairwell, and knocking them to the ground. The allegations also include tax evasion spanning June 2, 2020, to April 2, 2024. Despite these developments, Schueler has remained active on social media, posting comments that indirectly address the accusations. “If the haters really wanted to get me down, they could raise more than the $27M I did for medical research,” he posted on X on December 21. “Nothing makes haters angrier than success.” If the haters really wanted to get me down they could raise more than the $27M I did for medical research. Write free self help books better than my sciVive and Fix The World. Work in the courts for legal precedent for P2P publishing software. Found things that work flawlessly… — Richard Heart (@RichardHeartWin) December 22, 2024 Schueler Sued by SEC Schueler is also entangled in a separate legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegations of unregistered crypto offerings. The SEC accuses him of raising over $1 billion through the sale of Hex, PulseChain (PLS), and PulseX (PSLX), marketing the tokens as lucrative investment opportunities. “Instead of using these investor funds to develop and market the PulseChain network, or even to fulfill Heart’s explicit statement that invested funds supported ‘freedom of speech,’ Heart and PulseChain used at least $12.1 million of investor funds for Heart’s personal luxury purchases,” the SEC alleged. The lawsuit also targeted Heart’s control of the project, his statements regarding potential increases in value, and the staking feature designed to encourage token holders to lock up their tokens in exchange for more tokens. The SEC pointed to Heart’s previous comments claiming that Hex was built to be “the highest appreciating asset” and noted the significant decline in the price of Hex and the perceived worthlessness of tokens for the other two projects. According to the federal agency, Heart purchased several luxury automobiles with investors’ money, including a Ferrari and McLaren sports car and numerous designer watches. The supposed crypto scam artist further defrauded investors and bought the world’s largest black diamond, a 555-carat piece known as “The Enigma,” valued at over $4 million, from Sotheby’s in February 2022. On August 22, Schueler sought to dismiss the lawsuit, but the SEC countered, asserting its jurisdiction to pursue the case.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK.

Solana’s SOL: A High-Speed Blockchain for Scalable Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform that prioritizes scalability, offering a foundation for decentralized applications with faster transactions and support for multiple programming languages. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to the ecosystem, enabling transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. Unlike some platforms that rely on sharding or second-layer solutions, Solana focuses on a high-capacity network to attract developers and investors. The potential of SOL lies in its ability to support a wide range of high-activity projects and services. In the current market cycle, Solana’s emphasis on speed and scalability positions it as an attractive option for those interested in decentralized applications and blockchain technology. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within Ethereum’s ecosystem. The coin started with a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and “burned” 40% of the total supply, reducing circulation. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB aims for broader utility by developing platforms like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform and governance system. Its integration with Ethereum allows for potential growth in decentralized applications. Conclusion While SOL and SHIB show less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out for those pursuing excellence. Designed for alpha males seeking luxury and success, it offers real benefits and community. With expected 700% growth in presale and potential thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN could achieve record-breaking success.

A recent analysis has identified similarities between Tesla's (TSLA) historical price movements and XRP's current trajectory, suggesting a major rally could follow its ongoing correction. Interestingly, this market commentary comes from analyst EGRAG, who believes XRP could mimic Tesla's path, potentially reaching a price of $41 within the next 91 days. Tesla's Historical Rally Market data confirms that in December 2018, Tesla saw a massive price drop after CEO Elon Musk appeared on the CBS program ""60 Minutes."" The stock fell to $12 during a corrective phase but later staged a remarkable recovery. Over the next 912 days, Tesla witnessed an impressive rebound. After reclaiming the previous high of $24, Tesla soared to hit a resistance level of $58 in April 2020. It immediately surpassed this level, claiming a top of $170 by late 2020 and then the ultimate peak of $410 in November 2021.XRP Could Follow a Similar PathEGRAG identified similar circumstances in XRP's market. He noted Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse's December 2024 appearance on the same program and a subsequent price drop. While the chart suggests XRP's decline may continue in the short term, EGRAG believes it mirrors Tesla's early struggles before its explosive rally. As of today, XRP trades at $2.22 after a 1.97% gain, still far below its December 3 peak of $2.90. XRP and Tesla 1M Charts | EGRAG Crypto This decline, accelerated by hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve, places XRP roughly 20% below its recent highs. The chart analysis also highlights a critical support level at $2.1244, which could play a pivotal role in XRP's recovery.Meanwhile, EGRAG anticipates a steeper correction, with prices potentially dropping to $1.20 before a rebound. Despite these bearish movements, the analyst remains optimistic about a massive rally following this phase. According to his projection, following the projected drop to $1.20, XRP could reclaim the $2.4 mark and then soar to $5.6, a new all-time high. Beyond this level, EGRAG expects an XRP rally to $17 before eventually claiming the ultimate $41 target in 91 days.EGRAG justified the 10X factor by stating that crypto moves faster than stocks, reducing Tesla's 912-day rally to 91 days for XRP.

According to authorities, the suspects, 23-year-old Gabriel Hay of Beverly Hills and Gavin Mayo of Thousands Pam’s were accused of scamming unsuspecting investors in a crypto scheme. In a statement by prosecutors, the two men were charged with taking funds for investment in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and disappearing. The prosecutors also mentioned that the duo floated several crypto schemes that met the same end as their NFT scheme. According to a statement from the United States Attorney’s office, the two men, with help from another person, carried out this scam from May 2021 to May 2024. The statement revealed that they carried out an act known as rug pull, where developers or people in charge of a project take out investor funds and abandon the project. Two California men charged for multiple crypto scam schemes In the indictment, the prosecutors noted that the suspects, Hay and Mayo, lied to investors about the state of one of their projects, Vault of Games. The duo claimed that the NFT project will be the first to be pegged to a hard asset. They also lied to investors that the Vault of Games project would work with jewelers worldwide, a claim that was found to be false. In addition, the men also claimed they had started making their exchange, where jewelers would come and register to provide service. Things started to go south when the Vault of Games’ handle on X posted in November 2021, asking what was happening. After a while, the followers gathered around the project’s comment section, accusing them of deleting the investor’s page on their Discord channel. Most users were frustrated, lashing out at the project, with one thing evident; they had been scammed by its founders. The comments later accused the developers of stealing the community funds, with most of them disappointed that they failed to deliver on their promise. Prosecutors list out the allegations against the men According to the prosecutors, the California men acted brazenly and without remorse, transferring the stolen funds into their wallets. They also mentioned that the Vault of Games was not the duo’s first rodeo, tying them to the rug pulls of projects like Faceless, Sinful Souls, Dirty Dogs, Uncovered, Roost Coin, Clout Coin, MoonPortal, among others. In her statement, the Department of Justice (DOJ) Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole Argentieri condemned the act, citing the dangers of emerging technologies. “Fraudsters take advantage of new technologies and financial products to steal investors’ hard-earned money,” Argentieri said. Argentieri also assured the public that the department will continue a clampdown on individuals and entities carrying out these acts. “The department is committed to protecting investors and will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to root out fraud involving cryptocurrency and other digital assets and bring offenders to justice,” she added. In addition to their charges, prosecutors claimed that Hay and Mayo stalked one of their project managers, harassing him for outing one of their projects as a scam. The prosecutors said when the project manager, who was first blamed for the rug pull, pointed to the Californian men as the creators of the project, they sent several threatening messages to him in hopes of getting him to recant his story. They also posed as fake lawyers to make him back down from talking to the cops. In one of the emails, Hay and Mayo threatened to falsely accuse the project manager’s parents of carrying out improper sexual acts. The indictment mentioned that the last threat came in September 2023, with the duo reminding the project manager that they were still watching him while planning ‘to destroy’ him. The California men are charged with a count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of stalking, and two counts of wire fraud. If the prosecutors get a favorable ruling, they could spend up to 25 years in jail.

A Deal That Fueled TerraUSD Collapse The SEC revealed that in 2021, Tai Mo Shan struck a deal with Terraform Labs to purchase Terra LUNA tokens at a significant discount. The firm later acquired $20 million worth of UST to artificially maintain the stablecoin’s 1:1 peg with the US dollar. However, when UST lost its peg in May 2022, the fallout was devastating, causing widespread financial losses for investors. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler noted the broader implications of the collapse, stating, “The impact reverberated throughout the crypto markets, eventually costing the savings of countless investors. Regardless of the labels, crypto market participants should comply with securities laws where applicable and not deceive the public.” The incident has since become an important case for the cryptocurrency industry, fueling regulatory efforts like the Lummis-Gillibrand Stablecoin Act of 2024 , which bans algorithmic stablecoins entirely. The Chain Reaction of Failure At its peak, TerraUSD ranked as the third-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Its downfall began on May 8, 2022, when a whale dumped $285 million worth of UST, causing it to depeg and fall to $0.98. The situation worsened rapidly as fear and uncertainty gripped the market, leading to a sharp decline in UST’s value to $0.67 within two days. The panic-selling and cascading liquidations revealed a critical flaw in the system: UST’s market capitalization had outgrown its collateral reserves of LUNA, making the stablecoin fundamentally unsustainable. The algorithmic mechanism meant to stabilize UST crumbled under pressure, resulting in the complete collapse of its value. The repercussions were far-reaching. The SEC launched a formal investigation into Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, ultimately leading to legal actions and fines totaling $4.4 billion. The settlement with Tai Mo Shan serves as a stark reminder of the risks inherent in algorithmic stablecoins and the importance of regulatory oversight to safeguard investors.

Originally announced as the leader of the newly created Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, Sacks' position is now shifting to more of an advisory capacity, according to sources close to Trump's transition team. While Sacks was initially expected to lead the administration’s technology policy, the bulk of operational leadership will now fall to Michael Kratsios, a Scale AI executive and former US Chief Technology Officer during Trump’s first term. Kratsios will oversee technology policy alongside Gale Slater, who will focus on telecoms and antitrust. Sources say Sacks’ decision to scale back his role stems from his refusal to leave his investment firm Craft Ventures and his unwillingness to take on a full-time government position that would require Senate confirmation. Instead, Sacks is expected to serve as a Special Government Employee (SGE), a title that would allow him to intermittently advise the government while continuing his private sector duties. Sacks’s dual role has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. While SGEs face fewer restrictions than regular government employees, critics argue such arrangements can make policy implementation and accountability more difficult. Related News: BitMEX Founder Arthur Hayes Praised This Altcoin Today: Hours Later, He Sold Big “Not leaving office and not taking on a formal government role complicates things a lot,” said one source familiar with the transition process. “Even if conflicts of interest are often overlooked in this administration, there’s a realization that the tech policy role needs someone who is fully operational and hands-on.” Kratsios, who was heavily involved in the transition team, is now expected to take the lead in personnel management and executing day-to-day policy initiatives. Despite the redefinition of his role, Sacks insists he remains at the center of the administration’s technology strategy. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Sacks dismissed reports that his role was being scaled back as “nonsense.” “I plan to spend 50% of my time in Washington making policy and 50% in Silicon Valley keeping up with the latest technology.

37958829,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666205,1734858047,Solana Price Continues Downward Slide — Is A Rebound Possible At $180?,"Solana (SOL) was one of the large-cap assets affected by the recent market downturn triggered by the US Federal Reserve’s rate cut. The Solana price succumbed to the bearish pressure and fell beneath $200 for the first time in over a month. While the price of SOL has continued its downward spiral in the past day, a prominent crypto analyst on X believes that the altcoin might be gearing for a rebound already. Below is how the Solana price could course-correct and resume its bullish trend. Can SOL Price Reclaim $200 Again? In a post on the X platform, crypto pundit Ali Martinez shared an interesting insight into the current Solana price action. According to the analyst, several indicators and formations are pointing to a rebound for the altcoin’s price. Related Reading: SUI Shows Strong Bullish Comeback: Breakout Above $4.98 In Sight This prediction revolves around quite a number of indicators and chart formations. Firstly, Martinez noted that the price of Solana appears to be testing a key support zone between the $188 and $179 region. As shown in the chart above, this price zone has served as a significant resistance level in the past — from March to November. Typically, when the price flips a resistance zone, the level tends to act as a significant support should the price return to it. Besides the cost basis of investors, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also pointing to a potential rebound for the Solana price. The RSI, which tracks an asset’s overbought and oversold levels, is currently at 31.72. According to Martinez, this RSI level has acted as support in the past, with the Solana price traveling to new swing highs on each occasion. Monitoring this indicator could provide the right time to enter a long position for the altcoin. Furthermore, the stochastic RSI is currently at oversold levels, suggesting that the price might be ready for a reversal. The Stoch RSI differs from the regular indicator in terms of the sensitivity and timeliness of its signals. Martinez did not specify a target for the Solana price should the indicator signals prove true. However, a glance at price action data shows that the altcoin’s price tends to at least return to its previous swing high whenever it finds support at the aforementioned levels. Solana Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Solana is hovering around $180, reflecting a disappointing 6% decline in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s performance is even much worse on the weekly timeframe, having dropped by nearly 17% in the last seven days.

Social media sentiment shows a surge in FUD, with negative comments outweighing positive ones. Historical patterns indicate that extreme pessimism could signal a potential bullish reversal for Bitcoin. In the last 24 hours, after coming close to reclaiming the $100K level once again, the price of Bitcoin plummeted to $95K. The initial recovery toward the six-figure level came after a crash to $92K last week. However, the recovery rally failed to sustain as the market is tanking again. Bitcoin FUD Now at Historic Levels Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s recent price slump has triggered a wave of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among traders, reaching the highest levels of negativity recorded this year.

Despite the market-wide decline, these coins have a history of bouncing back stronger, making them the best candidates for this category. Let’s find out if INTL, PEPE, AAVE, and ADA can 10x an investment portfolio!

Investors across the market are gravitating towards this platform to take advantage of its long-term value proposition. Its tools can help them scale up their performances in the market. Whale Sends 150 Billion PEPE to Binance A PEPE whale has stunned the crypto community after depositing 150 billion PEPE coins worth $2.72 million into Binance. On-chain trend tracker Lookonchain reported this development in an X post on December 19, 2024. This deposit comes amid an ongoing decline in asset prices. Speculations have erupted that the whale intends to sell these coins to curtail losses, having already lost $229,000 during the dip. However, this decline will give potential investors a chance to bid PEPE at a lower price and sell when its value rises during the next market leg-up. For now, PEPE trades at $0.00001609, down 31.49% over the week. Aave Blockchain Draws Up Proposal to Launch Aave V3 On Sonic Aave DAO has come up with a governance proposal to launch Aave V3 on Sonic. This proposal comes after Sonic Labs announced the launch of its mainnet Sonic on December 18, 2024. The proposal demands the support of Aave community members towards the deployment of the Aave v3, with a $22 minion TVL, on the layer-1 EVM-compatible blockchain. Sonic Foundation is committing $15 million, 20 million USDC, and up to 50 million Sonic native tokens as incentives for this integration. The Aave team remarked that this initiative will open a new source of revenue for the network and boost its value in the market. As of now, AAVE trades for $295, down 19.56% over the week. Whale Interest Grows in ADA Despite Drop in the Cardano Coin’s Price Cardano’s ADA has experienced a chaotic drop in price due to the current state of the crypto market. The ADA price has dipped 25% over the past week. Despite this decline, a group of whale investors continue to accumulate the Cardano coin substantially. Reports show that these whales bought over 100 million ADA tokens in December 2024 alone. Whale purchases often precede a remarkable price surge, sparking speculation that ADA may be on the verge of a rebound. In the meantime, the Cardano coin has lost 25% of its value in the past week, dipping to a token price of $0.82. Buy INTL, PEPE, AAVE, and ADA For 10x Gains With the crypto market shedding gains, INTL, PEPE, AAVE, and ADA offer investors an opportunity to boost their portfolios tenfold during the next market leg-up. These assets have performed well in the past and are expected to repeat their previous performances again. However, INTL, a new crypto coin, stands out among these coins because of its ability to rival these top altcoins. INTL is still in Stage 8 of its public presale, valued at $0.073. With up to 50% gains up for grabs, before it reaches $0.110 at launch, smart investors are shifting their gaze to this coin. According to experts’ predictions, INTL can also soar 10x after its exchange debut. To secure all the gains on INTL, all you need to do is join the IntelMarkets presale now!

BTC’s Short-Term Recovery Although the business week started quite spectacularly for BTC, whose price skyrocketed from $101,000 to a new all-time high of over $108,000 by Tuesday, it actually turned sour on Wednesday after the latest US FOMC meeting. The primary cryptocurrency began a massive correction that culminated on Friday with a price slump to around $92,000. Thus, the asset had lost more than $16,000 in just 72 hours. At this point, the bulls finally managed to halt the freefall and helped BTC climb to $95,000. It kept going north on Saturday morning and jumped to $99,600.

One prominent trader has projected a 235% price increase for the token, suggesting it could reach $0.00005816, setting a new yearly high. The cryptocurrency market recently faced heightened volatility, with Bitcoin’s value dropping by over 10% in just two days to approximately $93,000. This decline had a ripple effect on altcoins, including Shiba Inu, which retested its $0.0002 support level. Despite the initial losses, Shiba Inu demonstrated remarkable recovery. The token surged by 28% from its recent low of $0.0000185 and continued to gain traction, rising by an additional 6% to trade above $0.000238 earlier yesterday. Analyst’s Bullish Predictions For Shiba Inu (SHIB) Dollars Maker, a well-known market analyst, has expressed strong confidence in Shiba Inu’s upward trajectory. In a recent TradingView commentary , he suggested that the token is poised for significant gains. He identified the December 20 price lows as an ideal entry point for long positions, citing the potential for a substantial upward movement. The analyst highlighted several key price targets for the token with the ultimate projection of $0.00005816 representing a 235% increase from its current levels. He believes the token will first aim for a notable rise to $0.00003339, followed by further gains to $0.00004566. This final surge would surpass its March 2024 high of $0.000045 and establish a new yearly peak. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Market Sentiment Other analysts have also shared optimistic outlooks for Shiba Inu. Klejdi Cuni noted that the token’s prolonged accumulation near the $0.00002424 support level indicates a solid foundation for future growth. He anticipates that this accumulation phase could propel the token to $0.000070 in the near term. Similarly, Pouyan TradeFX has forecasted an upward trend for Shiba Inu, projecting that it could break through a multi-year trendline that has constrained its growth. Once this resistance is overcome, the token could experience a significant rally, potentially exceeding a 100% increase in value. The recent recovery in the token’s price and the bullish predictions from multiple analysts highlight the token’s potential for substantial growth. While the projections range from moderate increases to a 235% surge, they reflect growing confidence in the token’s resilience and market position. However, investors are warned to approach these forecasts with caution and ensure careful consideration before making investment decisions.

With promising innovations and real-world applications, Qubetics ($TICS) , Stellar (XLM), and Algorand (ALGO) have emerged as the frontrunners for significant growth. Qubetics is leading the charge with its game-changing QubeQode platform, which makes blockchain development more accessible, while Stellar and Algorand have solidified themselves as leaders in payment solutions and scalable networks. Here’s why these three projects are the best coins for exponential returns and why they belong in your portfolio. Qubetics ($TICS): Bridging Accessibility With QubeQode Qubetics is fast becoming one of the most innovative projects in the blockchain space, offering tools designed to simplify decentralised technology adoption. Now in its 13th presale stage, Qubetics has already sold over 365 million $TICS tokens to 11,100+ investors, raising more than $7.4 million. At just $0.0342 per token, Qubetics presents a rare opportunity for exponential returns for early investors. One of Qubetics’ most revolutionary features is QubeQode , a no-code development platform that allows businesses and individuals to build decentralised applications (dApps) without needing programming expertise. This feature removes barriers to blockchain adoption, empowering professionals, small businesses, and enterprises to enter the decentralised economy with ease. For example, a logistics company could use QubeQode to develop a transparent supply chain management app, improving tracking efficiency without incurring the cost of hiring blockchain developers. Likewise, a healthcare professional could create a secure, decentralised platform for patient data storage, ensuring data privacy and interoperability across healthcare providers. QubeQode democratizes access to blockchain technology, helping businesses of all sizes harness the benefits of decentralisation. By making development simple and affordable, Qubetics positions itself as a project with immense global potential. Qubetics has analysts predicting massive returns for $TICS holders. The token price is expected to hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, translating into over 630.19% ROI. Long-term projections of $5 to $10 post-mainnet launch suggest life-changing returns, with gains reaching as high as 29,107.82% ROI. For example, a $25,000 investment at today’s price of $0.0342 could grow to $7.3 million if $TICS reaches $10. With its accessible tools like QubeQode and strong market momentum, Qubetics is undeniably one of the best coins for exponential returns. Stellar (XLM): Transforming Global Payments Stellar is a leading blockchain platform designed to facilitate low-cost cross-border payments and financial inclusivity. Built to connect banks, payment systems, and individuals, Stellar’s network enables fast, secure transactions, making it a favourite among enterprises and NGOs. For example, Stellar allows a small business owner in South America to receive payments from international clients instantly and at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional banking systems. Similarly, humanitarian organisations use Stellar to distribute aid to remote areas efficiently, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring funds reach the right people. With its growing adoption and partnerships with major financial entities, Stellar remains a strong choice for investors looking for projects with real-world utility and scalability. Its established reputation as a leader in cross-border transactions positions Stellar as one of the best coins for exponential returns in the years to come. Algorand (ALGO): Delivering Scalability and Sustainability Algorand is a high-performance blockchain platform known for solving the blockchain trilemma—balancing decentralisation, security, and scalability. Its Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism enables Algorand to process thousands of transactions per second while maintaining energy efficiency and low fees. Algorand’s focus on sustainable scalability makes it an ideal platform for financial institutions, enterprises, and developers building decentralised finance (DeFi) solutions. For instance, a fintech startup can utilise Algorand to offer cross-border payment tools that are both affordable and reliable, tapping into underserved markets globally. Algorand’s robust partnerships, including collaborations with governments and enterprises, further solidify its position as a blockchain for real-world use cases. With increasing adoption and a growing DeFi ecosystem, Algorand continues to attract investor interest, making it one of the best coins for exponential returns in 2024. Conclusion: Why These Coins Offer Exponential Returns Qubetics ($TICS), Stellar (XLM), and Algorand (ALGO) are three of the best coins for exponential returns, offering unique innovations that meet the needs of a rapidly evolving digital economy. While Stellar focuses on transforming global payments and Algorand delivers scalable blockchain solutions, Qubetics takes the spotlight with its QubeQode feature, driving blockchain accessibility like never before. At just $0.0342 per $TICS token, Qubetics represents a rare opportunity for investors to get in early and maximise their returns. With projections pointing toward massive ROI, Qubetics is the Best Coins for Exponential Returns in 2024 .

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW.

Pseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 490,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is flashing technical signals that preceded steep rallies in the past. The trader shares a chart suggesting that Bitcoin has breached the upper range of its Bollinger Bands in the two-month time frame after spending about two years recovering from a bear market bottom. Traders use Bollinger Bands to identify potential periods of volatility expansion and determine whether an asset is overbought or oversold. TechDev’s chart also suggests that the two signals were present during the 2016 and 2020 market cycles – just before BTC ignited parabolic surges. “This is where things have gotten exciting.” Source: TechDev/X Looking at BTC from a different perspective, TechDev says Bitcoin is in the early stages of a parabolic ascent based on the crypto king’s logarithmic moving average convergence divergence (LMACD) indicator. The LMACD indicator is designed to reveal changes in an asset’s trend, strength and momentum. “Paying attention to the high time frames (HTFs) offers the best chance to trade the cycles. $30,000 was not the top, because HTF expansion had not ended. $50,000 was not the top, because HTF expansion had not ended. $70,000 was not the top, because HTF expansion had not ended. $90,000 was not the top, because HTF expansion had not ended. And HTF expansion still has not ended.” Source: TechDev/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that Bitcoin will not witness a cycle top until the LMACD on the two-month chart hits its resistance at 0.12. BTC’s LMACD appears to be currently hovering at 0.04. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $97,274.

Announced via the protocol’s official X account, this achievement has fueled growing community demands for cross-network connectivity through a dedicated bridge. Sonic Performance Metrics Spark Industry Buzz Sonic Chain’s early performance has captured major attention, particularly from developers and industry insiders. Core developer Andre Cronje highlighted an impressive 850 transactions per second (TPS) under the network’s current “safety mode,” a configuration designed to onboard validators securely. Interestingly, independent data from Sealaunch on-chain explorers recorded an even higher 1,620 TPS on December 18, further solidifying Sonic Chain’s reputation as one of the fastest blockchain ecosystems in operation. Despite these promising numbers, Cronje noted that Sonic Chain is not yet running at its full capacity. This leaves room for further optimization and scaling as more validators join and the network matures. The project, part of Fantom’s broader evolution into Sonic Labs, officially transitioned in September and went live on December 18 after months of rigorous development . Competing in a Crowded Market The broader crypto community has been quick to endorse Sonic Chain’s potential. Industry figures, including prominent investor Ran Neuner, have praised its speed and scalability. However, Sonic faces stiff competition from heavyweights like Ethereum, Solana, and Base Network —a Layer-2 solution that dominates Ethereum’s Total Value Locked (TVL) landscape. To accelerate its adoption, Sonic Labs has proposed that the Uniswap DAO allocate 250,000 UNI tokens as liquidity mining rewards for its validators. This initiative forms part of a broader effort to build liquidity and attract developers to the platform. Adding to its ambitious roadmap, Cronje has outlined plans to launch a series of decentralized applications (DApps) aimed at further enhancing Sonic Chain’s ecosystem. These initiatives are seen as crucial for establishing its foothold in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. As the protocol matures, the coming months will be pivotal in determining Sonic Chain’s ability to sustain its momentum and compete with established players.

Trump’s Victory Sparks Crypto Chaos: $XYZ Meme Coin Ready to Deliver a 99,900% Knockout Donald Trump’s election victory has triggered a seismic shift in the crypto market, setting the stage for a bull run like no other. As the dust settles, major coins limp forward with uninspiring double-digit gains, while meme coins are stealing the show. PNUT’s recent 4,500% surge? FRED’s 6,000% explosion?

IOTA (IOTA) IOTA is a new kind of distributed ledger technology that’s changing the game in the world of Web3. Instead of using a traditional blockchain, it uses something called the Tangle—a network structure that looks like a multi-dimensional blockchain. This unique design allows for direct and secure transfers of data and value, recorded immutably on the network. People, businesses, and institutions can all use IOTA’s open-source tools to build and interact in the decentralized web. With its upcoming IOTA 2.0 upgrade in 2024, the project aims to achieve full decentralization. IOTA also works closely with its staging network, Shimmer, to offer solutions for a secure and open infrastructure that could drive the future economy. By enabling the development of decentralized applications with smart contracts compatible with Ethereum, it opens doors for more developers to participate. In a market where scalability and transaction speed are key, IOTA’s technology stands out. Compared to traditional blockchain coins, IOTA’s Tangle offers a fresh approach that could address some of the limitations faced by others. As the decentralized space evolves, technologies like IOTA may play a significant role in shaping what’s next. dYdX (DYDX) dYdX is changing how people trade futures in the crypto world. Founded in 2017 by Antonio Juliano, it’s a platform that lets users trade perpetual futures without needing permission from a central authority. It offers two main products: dYdX Chain (V4) and dYdX V3. The dYdX Chain is a Layer-1 network built with the Cosmos SDK, using Delegated Proof-of-Stake for security. This means users can trade by depositing USDC, and no central party takes trading fees. On the other hand, dYdX V3 uses Layer-2 technology from StarkWare, which makes transactions faster and cheaper on the Ethereum network. This blend of technologies provides users with flexibility and efficiency in their trading. The potential of dYdX lies in its innovation and responsiveness to market needs. By migrating from the ERC-20 ethDYDX token to a native DYDX token on its own chain, and initiating trading rewards in 2023, dYdX has shown a commitment to enhancing user experience. Its use of zero-knowledge rollups and focus on decentralization set it apart from other platforms. In the current market cycle, where traders seek speed, low costs, and trustless environments, platforms like dYdX are gaining attention. While the crypto market is volatile, dYdX’s advancements in technology and services position it as a noteworthy player in the decentralized finance space. Conclusion IOTA and DYDX are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out with its sports memecoin aiming for huge gains and community-driven growth in the 2024 bull run.

37958119,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52711,1734854416,DTX Exchange (DTX) Prediction: These Bullish Metrics on XRP Charts Hint at $4 Surge While ADA Retests $0.80 Support,"With Bitcoin’s momentum fuelling the crypto market, the focus has turned to top altcoins Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA). Another potential breakout is on Ripple as it approaches the $4 mark. As Cardano retests $0.8 support, DTX Exchange (DTX) is making a storm as a revolutionary hybrid trading platform that can outperform the market’s stalwarts. Ripple (XRP): On the Verge of a $4 Breakout Ripple (XRP) continues to solidify itself further as an institutional and retail favorite of investors. XRP’s recent win against the SEC injects some much-needed freshness into the crypto market. With Ripple tokens currently priced at $2.10, XRP is facing a slight correction in view of the recent interest rate cuts by the US FED. Currently showing some strenuous bullish signals, analysts attribute this potential for a breakout to several factors: Increasing Institutional Adoption: Demand for Ripple is being spurred up by the number of partnerships Ripple has made with major financial institutions and central banks across the globe. Positive Sentiment Post-Grayscale Trust Launch : This launch of Grayscale’s XRP Trust has increased institutional exposure, further improving liquidity and market confidence. Ripple Stablecoin: Launched on the 17th of December, the XRP stablecoin, RLUSD, is pegged to the US dollar. This also adds more liquidity to the ecosystem, addressing one of Ripple’s biggest criticisms. A surge to $4 may be the next target if XRP manages to break through its immediate selling pressures. Records indicate that when Ripple starts going, it tends to launch into parabolic price action and is a favorite to see massive gains this cycle. Cardano (ADA): Poised for Recovery at $0.80 One of the most versatile Layer-1 blockchains in the market, Cardano (ADA) has remained relevant, thanks to its consistent upgrades as well as its growing ecosystem. Cardano is a strong competitor when it comes to smart contracts, but its focus on scalability and sustainability is what it is known for. ADA has shown a slight decrease, retesting its $0.80 support. However, many analysts think this correction is nothing more than FUD, with key catalysts in favor of Cardano reclaiming its previous highs: DeFi Expansion: DeFi on Cardano is growing, with Total Value Locked (TVL) rising steadily above $700 million. Enhanced Governance: With the upcoming CIP-1694 proposal which would introduce decentralized chain governance, the platform has gained new attention. Institutional Adoption: Given Cardano’s green blockchain narrative, ESG focused institutional investors can feel comfortable with ADA as a foundation for growth over the long term. Once market conditions improve, ADA could catapult back to $1, becoming one of the best altcoins for the next bull run. DTX Exchange (DTX): Redefining the Future of Trading Despite the tug-of-war between XRP and ADA to take over their niche, the DTX Exchange (DTX) is making its way to establish itself as the ultimate hybrid trading platform. DTX combines the best of both centralized and decentralized exchanges to solve key pain points in the global trading space. Its concept has proven to be a viable one, seeing as the DTX presale raised a staggering $10,000,000 in early funding already. Is DTX Exchange a Game Changer? Unified Hybrid Blockchain: DTX’s proprietary VulcanX blockchain ties together traditional financial markets into DeFi, allowing seamless trading of ‘real world’ assets such as stocks, bonds, commodities and cryptocurrencies. Non-Custodial Storage Solutions: Traders maintain complete control over their funds and enjoy the best on-chain verification possible. Massive Upside Potential: With DTX priced at just $0.12 in its sixth ICO stage, the coin is expected to make a 7,000% gain once it lists on Tier-1 exchanges. DTX is a standout of ICOs this quarter, having strong investor interest and a growing community. Due to its ability to democratize financial markets, it is a compelling choice for investors looking for high growth. Conclusion Ripple and Cardano are definitely solid contenders within the crypto space, with DTX Exchange (DTX) setting itself apart from the rest. With its innovative hybrid trading platform, extensive market accessibility, and outstanding growth potential, it’s the best altcoin for investors aiming for life changing gains.

37956862,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375714,1734854104,This Pivotal Level Will Determine Whether XRP Goes to $2.7 or Below $2 Again (Analyst),"TL:DR; Ripple’s cross-border token took the recent market-wide meltdown quite badly, with its price dumping from over $2.7 to under $2 within days. The asset has recovered some ground but now sits at a pivotal level that will determine whether it resumes its bull run or slips once again. The start of the business week was quite bullish for XRP as the company behind it announced on Monday that its long-anticipated stablecoin will be officially released for trading on the next day. XRP went on a massive run, surging from under $2.4 to above $2.7 by the time the launch date arrived. However, it reversed its trajectory shortly after, and the broader market’s collapse took it south hard. In fact, Ripple’s token came crashing by 28% from the aforementioned local peak to $1.96. Many XRP whales used this opportunity to stack up on more tokens, which perhaps helped the asset recover some ground as it pumped to almost $2.4 yesterday. Nevertheless, it has lost its momentum once again and now struggles to remain above $2.2. According to popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez, this level is particularly significant for XRP’s future price movements. If it manages to maintain it, the token could resume its recent bullish activities and head toward $2.7 once again. In contrast, it risks falling beneath $2 for the third time in December if it breaks below it. If $XRP can hold above $2.20, it might consolidate for a while before taking another shot at the $2.70 resistance. But if the $2.20 support breaks, a downswing to $1.96 becomes imminent. pic.twitter.com/cdtdtSwzKy — Ali (@ali_charts) December 21, 2024 XRP indeed slipped below that line to $2.17 earlier today but managed to bounce off, at least for now. The next few days will be crucial to determine XRP’s closing price at the end of the year and if there will indeed be a Santa Claus rally, as many expected. With its most recent correction, XRP’s market cap has dropped once again to under $130 billion. This means that it has lost its third-place position to USDT, whose market capitalization is close to $140 billion.

37958118,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52835,1734853882,Expert Explains Why Investors Should Hold At Least 1000 XRP,"Edo Farina, the CEO of Alpha Lions Academy, has made a strong case for why investors should consider holding at least 1,000 XRP. In a recent video , he detailed the potential long-term benefits of investing in digital assets, emphasizing its growing relevance in the evolving financial landscape. He argues that the token’s utility and adoption prospects position it as a pivotal player in the shift toward a modern financial system. He believes securing a meaningful amount of the token now, before its value potentially increases, could be a strategic move for investors looking to benefit from what he describes as the greatest transfer of wealth in history. Establishing the 1,000 Benchmark Farina suggests that owning a minimum of 1,000 XRP is a critical goal for investors aiming to maximize future returns. Based on current market prices , this would require an investment of approximately $2,400. However, he believes this amount could yield significant returns as the asset gains traction and its utility expands. He believes the digital asset’s potential value could grow substantially, with future price projections ranging from $10 to $100 or more per token. This growth could be driven by increased adoption, particularly as Ripple collaborates with central banks and integrates the XRP Ledger into next-generation financial systems. Avoiding Common Mistakes One of the key points Farina raised was the importance of avoiding emotional trading decisions. He cited examples of investors who prematurely sold their XRP holdings at prices like $0.80 or $1, only to miss out on further gains as the market continued to rise. Farina cautioned against this reactive behavior, emphasizing the need for a disciplined, long-term perspective. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another critical issue Farina addressed is the risk of storing XRP on cryptocurrency exchanges. He highlighted incidents where exchanges have struggled with supply shocks or liquidation events, leaving investors vulnerable. To mitigate these risks, he strongly advised storing XRP in cold wallets, which provide enhanced security by keeping private keys offline. Farina also noted that removing holdings from exchanges can help investors avoid making impulsive decisions driven by short-term price fluctuations. By focusing on XRP’s long-term potential rather than monitoring its value daily, investors may experience less anxiety and make more rational decisions. The Importance of Long-Term Holding Farina believes that patience will be the key to success for investors. He urged holders to resist the temptation to sell early during market volatility, stressing that those who remain committed to their investment may reap significant rewards. According to Farina, only a small percentage of investors would benefit the most. For him, the 1,000 XRP target represents not just a financial milestone but also a commitment to understanding and participating in the future of digital finance. He expressed confidence that for those who hold onto their assets over the coming years, the financial rewards could be transformative by 2030 or even sooner.

37957015,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666217,1734852645,Bitcoin Cost Basis Distribution Reveals Strong Demand At $97K – Can BTC Hold?,"Bitcoin has had a whirlwind few days, hitting an all-time high (ATH) last Tuesday before tumbling into a sharp 15% correction. This period of heightened volatility has left investors divided, with some expecting a continued uptrend while others brace for more downside. The market is closely watching Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim its bullish momentum. Related Reading: XRP Whales Loading Up – Data Reveals Buying Activity Top analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted critical data from the Bitcoin cost basis distribution, pointing to $97K as a crucial support level. Martinez stresses that holding this level is essential for BTC to maintain its uptrend and fend off deeper corrections. However, Bitcoin’s price action remains uncertain as it struggles to break through the psychological barrier at $100K. While many investors see the recent correction as a healthy reset after BTC’s meteoric rise, the failure to push higher could signal a more prolonged consolidation phase. With Bitcoin trading near pivotal levels, the coming days will be critical in determining whether it will resume its climb to new highs or face additional headwinds. Bitcoin Holding Above Key Demand Bitcoin is holding steady above a critical demand level around $97,000, offering a beacon of hope for bulls after recent volatility. This stability follows a brief test of lower demand at $92,000, which reinforced the market’s ability to absorb selling pressure. While the short-term recovery is encouraging, the price remains at a pivotal point that could determine its trajectory heading into the new year. Martinez recently shared insights from the Bitcoin cost basis distribution, emphasizing the importance of the $99,000–$97,000 range. His data highlights this zone as the most significant support threshold for Bitcoin, acting as a critical line in the sand for the current uptrend. However, Martinez warns of the potential downside risk if Bitcoin fails to hold this range: “We really don’t want this level to become resistance.” As Bitcoin consolidates near these key levels, sentiment across the market remains indecisive. Bulls are eager to see BTC reclaim momentum and push toward all-time highs, but the psychological resistance around $100,000 continues to loom large. Meanwhile, bears argue that the recent pullback could be a sign of an impending larger correction. Related Reading: On-Chain Metrics Reveal Cardano Whales Are ‘Buying The Dip’ – Details The coming days will be crucial as the year draws to a close. With market participants looking for clarity, Bitcoin must hold this critical support zone or risk losing its bullish structure. Whether the next major move is up or down will depend heavily on how BTC reacts within this price range. BTC Testing Liquidity Bitcoin is trading at $97,000, showing resilience after rebounding from local lows of $92,000. This bounce highlights the market’s strong demand at lower levels, reinforcing the bullish narrative for now. The price structure remains intact above $97,000, indicating that BTC is well-positioned to stage another rally toward its ATH. However, the $100,000 psychological barrier looms large as the next major hurdle for bulls. This level has proven difficult to overcome, with previous attempts falling short. A successful breakout above $100,000 in the coming days would likely reignite bullish momentum and set the stage for Bitcoin to reach new ATHs, restoring confidence among investors and traders.

On the flip side, failure to breach this critical resistance could trigger a less favorable scenario.

In such a case, BTC could face another downturn, testing key support levels once again.

Meanwhile, Shiba Inu shows signs of a breakout, exciting its supporters. Rollblock, an online casino project, is thriving in this bull market, raising $7.4 million in presale . While SHIB eyes potential gains and DOGE struggles, Rollblock stands out as a rising star, attracting investors and gamers in the GambleFi space, and we will see why. Rollblock is betting big on the bull market—and winning Andrew Gellatly of GamblingCompliance once said that the future of gambling is online and that as technology keeps improving, online casinos will keep finding new and better ways to play. Rollblock is bringing this vision to life by pioneering safe, fast, and user-friendly gaming experiences in the bull market. Rollblock is a haven for players.

By combining cryptocurrency with the best of online gaming, Rollblock isn’t just keeping up with the market—it’s driving it forward. As the bull market heats up, Rollblock’s innovative approach makes it a standout choice for investors and players alike. DOGE price prediction: Trouble ahead The price of DOGE may decline shortly. Since more individuals are selling than buying right now, it is on a downward trajectory. Buyers are finding it difficult to maintain a consistent price; should this continue, DOGE can drop below $0.3. However, if interest picks up, it might bounce back to $0.45. For now, things aren’t looking great. Over the past month, Dogecoin’s price started around $0.50 and dropped to $0.294. It went up and down a few times but kept falling overall, with a big drop near the end of the month. Shiba Inu’s breakout: Can it gain momentum? Traders are getting mixed signals from Shiba Inu (SHIB). Slow trading limits its growth, and the transfer of many SHIB tokens to exchanges indicates a drop. Support between $0.000024 and $0.000025 looks promising, but breaking over $0.000030 requires higher buying pressure and market momentum. Over the month, Shiba Inu’s price went up and down a lot. It started higher, hit a peak of $0.00003225 in the middle of the month, then dropped sharply. By the end of the month, it was down to $0.00002016. This likely means many people sold their coins after the price went up, causing it to fall steadily. Rollblock keeps the bull market buzzing while others struggle to catch up As we ride the bull market wave, Rollblock stands out by offering secure transactions and rewarding opportunities. While DOGE price prediction projects gloom and SHIB’s breakout potential depends on market momentum, Rollblock’s seamless blockchain integration and passive income rewards keep things exciting.

As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies reach all-time highs this year, Tether’s USDT stablecoin, pegged to the U.S. dollar, has seen a surge in demand. The market value of USDT is set to increase by about $50 billion by 2024, reaching over $140 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Tether generates the bulk of its revenue by investing the reserves that back its stablecoins in assets like U.S. Treasury bonds, gold and other securities. Ardoino said more than half of its net profit this year has been reinvested into various initiatives. Tether announced a $775 million investment in video-sharing platform Rumble, including a $250 million cash investment and support for a takeover offer of up to 70 million shares at $7.50 each. Related News: After Partial Recovery, Developers Unlock $243 Million Tokens In This Altcoin Ardoino also revealed Tether’s plans to expand into AI. The company is set to launch its own AI platform in the first quarter of 2025, allowing users to interact with AI via their mobile phones. “Next year, we plan to use at least half of the profits in investments, including AI,” Ardoino said. Tether is also exploring additional investments in the United States in anticipation of a more favorable regulatory environment under President-elect Donald Trump.

37956092,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375562,1734852512,These Are the Top 10 Cryptocurrencies by ‘Notable Development Activity’ (Santiment),"TL;DR Internet Computer (ICP), Chainlink (LINK), and Hedera (HBAR) retained their top spots in terms of “notable development activity.” The rankings are based on filtered development events that reflect real progress, emphasizing active contributions from developers. The Top 10 List Cryptocurrency analytics platform Santiment recently estimated that Internet Computer (ICP) ranked first in terms of “notable development activity” in the past month, collecting a score of 409.63. The asset started December on the right foot, with its price jumping to a multi-month high of over $15. However, the latest market correction negatively affected ICP, which plummeted below $10 (per CoinGecko’s data). ICP Price, Source: CoinGecko Chainlink (LINK) claimed the second spot with a ratio of 287.07, while Hedera (HBAR) ranked third. It is interesting to note that the top 3 club looked exactly the same after the previous research. Starknet (STRK) climbed the ladder and was positioned in fourth place, while Cardano (ADA) lost some steam and is now fifth. Similar to ICP and many other cryptocurrencies, ADA was at the forefront of gains in the first week of the month. On December 7, its price touched $1.30 (a level last observed at the start of 2022). The peak was short-lived, though, with ADA currently trading at around $0.84. The other digital assets down the line include Optimism (OP), Polkadot (DOT), Kusama (KSM), DeFiChain (DFI), and sUSD (SUSD). Santiment’s Methodology To conduct the aforementioned research , the platform’s team employs the so-called Ecosystem Dev Activity Dashboard, which shows the number of development events created on various blockchains and their associated dApps. “These events are carefully filtered and predefined to be representative of real programming progress, meaning no low-value actions are taken into consideration . This way, any crypto-curious person can easily see which are the most active crypto ecosystems out there,” the working group explained. The team emphasized the importance of the size of a project’s community, particularly focusing on how many members are developers and actively contributing to the ecosystem. Finally, Santiment clarified that development activity differs from GitHub activity. The former focuses on specific types of events, excluding things like commits, forks, comments, and project management tasks. In contrast, GitHub is comprised of all kinds of factors apart from commits. “One key distinction between Dev Activity and GitHub Activity is that Dev Activity allows for a fairer comparison between different organizations. This is because some events excluded in Dev Activity are related to Issues and Issue Comments,” Santiment’s team concluded.

37956296,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52833,1734852127,Rumor Says Swiss Government Officially Adopts Cardano (ADA) as its First-Ever National Crypto,"Recent discussions within the Cardano (ADA) community have sparked speculation that Switzerland has officially adopted ADA as its national cryptocurrency. However, these claims require further scrutiny to separate fact from fiction. Origin of the Speculation The rumors originated from a December 19 post by the official X account of HOSKY , a meme coin project associated with Cardano. The post humorously declared that ADA had been chosen as Switzerland’s official cryptocurrency. Many community members responded with curiosity, asking whether the claim was legitimate. Further fueling the debate, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, shared the post with a tongue-in-cheek comment , adding to the lighthearted nature of the announcement. Despite this, some members of the community were left unsure of whether the claim was satire or a genuine development. Well, at least we get chocolates and nice watches https://t.co/NnSj836nhv pic.twitter.com/dxoOKzRY4L — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 20, 2024 Tensions Within the Cardano Ecosystem This playful post coincides with ongoing concerns among Cardano supporters regarding the governance and operations of the Cardano Foundation, the organization responsible for promoting the token’s adoption. The Foundation, established under Swiss law, has faced criticism for its lack of transparency and accountability to the community. One of the primary issues highlighted by critics, including Hoskinson, is the method by which the Foundation’s board members are selected. Under Swiss regulations governing foundations, board members are appointed without direct input from the community, as foundations in Switzerland are not designed to function as membership-based organizations. In a December 18 post, Hoskinson voiced dissatisfaction with the current governance structure. He criticized the Cardano Foundation for its limited community involvement in decision-making and suggested relocating the organization to jurisdictions with more flexible regulatory environments, such as Abu Dhabi or Wyoming. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Role of the Swiss Government The claim that ADA has been adopted as Switzerland’s national cryptocurrency appears to be tied to broader discussions about the Swiss government’s influence over the Cardano Foundation. While the Foundation operates under Swiss laws, there is no evidence to suggest that the Swiss government has officially endorsed or adopted ADA as a national cryptocurrency. The HOSKY post seems to be a satirical take on the community’s frustration with the Foundation’s governance model and its perceived alignment with Swiss regulatory frameworks. While the playful speculation brought attention to these issues, it also underscored the need for clear communication and transparency. As discussions about governance continue, it remains to be seen whether the Foundation will take steps to address these concerns or consider relocating to a more community-focused regulatory environment.

37955739,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375641,1734851843,"CryptoQuant Says Bitcoin Demand is ‘Eating’ Available Inventory, Here’s How","With the crypto market halfway through this bull cycle, the amount of bitcoin readily available for sale is shrinking faster relative to demand growth. On-chain analysis by the market intelligence firm CryptoQuant revealed that the bitcoin market is currently experiencing a demand shock because demand growth is accelerating and supply is shrinking. According to a weekly CryptoQuant report , bitcoin apparent demand has been expanding since late September at a monthly rate of 228,000 BTC, while the total amount of BTC readily available for sale across crypto exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) desks, miners, and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has declined to levels not seen since October 2020. BTC Demand Is Eating Supply Inventory The balance of BTC accumulator addresses, which refer to investors who buy BTC and have never sold any, is expanding monthly at a record-high rate of 495,000 BTC. Bitcoin demand growth has led to inventory levels at OTC desks declining by the largest monthly volume in 2024 for the first time since April 25. Bitcoin OTC desks’ monthly inventory has fallen by -26,000 BTC this year, with an additional 40,000 BTC decline in tier balance since November 20. “OTC desks source Bitcoin mostly for institutions and large buyers. If Bitcoin demand is outpacing supply, then OTC desks’ Bitcoin balances will decline, and vice versa. Right now, their balances are declining as demand outpaces supply,” CryptoQuant stated. Sell-side Liquidity Falls to 2020 Levels As demand continues to rise, so does liquidity in the industry. The total market cap of USD-based stablecoins recently crossed $200 billion for the first time, representing a 20% or $35 billion increase since late October. This reflects an influx of liquidity and fresh money in the crypto market. The growth also coincided with BTC rallying above $100,000 to $108,000. The crypto asset was worth $96,700 at the time of writing, per data from CoinMarketCap. Furthermore, bitcoin sell-side liquidity now hovers around 3.397 million BTC, the lowest level in over four years. This liquidity has shrunk even further by 678,000 BTC so far this year, greatly reducing the potential for selling pressure. Moreover, the liquidity inventory ratio, a metric that measures how many months of demand the current sell-side inventory covers, has fallen to 6.6 months from 41 months recorded at the beginning of October. CryptoQuant explained that a declining sell-side inventory ratio coincided with the BTC rallies witnessed in the first and fourth quarters of 2024.

XRP’s price is at a crossroads and has lost the majority of the gains made in the last seven days. All of the top 10 coins are trading in red, with Solana and Dogecoin recording double-digit losses. Analysts are speculating that XRP might be in the midst of a larger correction, following a strong rally earlier this month. The price could be undergoing a consolidation phase, which may either be part of a larger corrective pattern or a more extended sideways movement. Potential Scenarios, Key Resistance and Support Levels Resistance Zone The immediate resistance for XRP is between $2.30 and $2.53. If the price reaches this range, it may face selling pressure and could potentially reverse to the downside. Traders should be cautious if the price approaches this area. Critical Support Level The key support level to watch is $1.96, where a previous low was formed earlier in December. If XRP drops below this level, it could trigger further selling, potentially pushing the price lower into a range between $1.39 and $1.80. Consolidation Phase XRP could be in the midst of a consolidation phase, where the price moves sideways within a defined range. This could be a correction after the recent rally. If XRP remains above the $1.96 level, it could eventually break higher, potentially testing the resistance zone between $2.30 and $2.53. Downside Risk If XRP breaks below the $1.96 support, it could enter a deeper correction. In this case, the price might move towards the lower support zone between $1.39 and $1.80.

XYZ is currently undervalued, and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Don’t miss your shot at being part of the XYZ winning team! Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has experienced notable price fluctuations recently. In the past week, its price declined by 13.66%, moving within a range of $3,648.43 to $4,137.17. Over the last month, however, it saw a gain of 7.75%, indicating some positive momentum amid the volatility. Looking at the six-month timeframe, Ethereum’s price decreased by 4.14%, reflecting a mixture of short-term gains and longer-term challenges. Technical indicators provide insight into Ethereum’s current state. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 31.82, which is near the oversold threshold. This suggests that the asset may be undervalued at present levels. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $3,403.46, below the 100-day average of $3,807.62, showing a dip in short-term pricing compared to the longer-term trend. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is at -85.71, indicating bearish momentum, while the stochastic value of 13.16 is low, often associated with oversold conditions. Considering support and resistance levels, if Ethereum’s price moves upward, it may encounter resistance at $4,317.86, which is about 18% above the current lower price range. Surpassing this, the next resistance level is $4,806.60, approximately 32% higher. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $3,340.38, about 9% below the current price. If the price falls further, the second support level is $2,851.64, representing a potential decline of roughly 22%. These levels are key areas that may influence Ethereum’s price action in the near future. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced significant volatility lately. In the past week, its price dipped by 23.46%. Over the last month, it decreased by 13.15%. However, looking at the past six months, SHIB saw a rise of 19.81%. This mix of short-term declines and longer-term gains highlights the coin’s unpredictable nature. Currently, SHIB is trading between $0.00002396 and $0.000032. The nearest resistance level is $0.00003614, and the closest support level is $0.00002006. If the price breaks above the resistance, it could target the second resistance at $0.00004418, representing a substantial percentage increase. On the downside, falling below the support might see the price testing the second support level at $0.00001202. Technical indicators offer more insights. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.00002187, below the 100-day average of $0.00002547. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 32.79, while the Stochastic is at 28.66, both suggesting that SHIB is approaching oversold territory. The MACD level is negative at -0.0000006701, indicating bearish momentum. These factors might imply potential for a price reversal or further decline, making SHIB a coin to watch closely. Conclusion Despite ETH and SHIB’s strong gains, XYZVerse steals the spotlight with its unique sports-meme blend, aiming for 20,000% growth and becoming the G.O.A.T of memecoins.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE.

Despite a 24% decline over the past week, Dogecoin remains up by 246% year-to-date, trading at $0.3078. Given its strong performance in 2024, analysts are optimistic about its future potential. Discussions have emerged around the token achieving key price milestones, including $10, $20, $50, and even $100. To provide insights, both Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT were consulted for their predictions on when the asset might achieve these price points. Their responses highlight both the opportunities and challenges facing the meme-inspired cryptocurrency. Timelines According to Grok According to Grok, Dogecoin could reach $10 as early as 2029 or as late as January 2040. This estimate aligns with projections from sources like Changelly and CoinCodex. Achieving this milestone would require a market capitalization of approximately $1.41 trillion. Grok also suggests that Dogecoin might hit $20 between 2040 and 2045. However, this projection is more speculative due to the significant increase in market capitalization required, approximately $2.82 trillion. While Grok does not provide a clear timeline for $50, it acknowledges that reaching $100 would require a market cap exceeding $14.73 trillion. Grok views this goal as unlikely under current market conditions. Optimistic scenarios place the possibility for $100 beyond 2040, though such a valuation is widely considered unrealistic without transformative changes in the global financial landscape. Timelines According to ChatGPT ChatGPT offered a more detailed breakdown of the conditions under which Dogecoin could achieve these price points, focusing on factors such as market growth and adoption. ChatGPT estimates that the asset could reach $10 between 2028 and 2032, provided it captures 10% of an anticipated $15 trillion cryptocurrency market. This level of adoption would require strategic partnerships, increased use cases, and broader acceptance of blockchain technology. For the asset to reach $20, ChatGPT forecasts a timeline of 2030 to 2035. Achieving this price would necessitate a market cap of $2.82 trillion, assuming the total crypto market expands to $30 trillion and Dogecoin maintains a 10% share. The AI further predicts that Dogecoin could hit $50 between 2035 and 2040, contingent upon the global cryptocurrency market reaching $70 trillion. This valuation would require the token to sustain substantial dominance in the market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to ChatGPT, the $100 target is the most speculative. For this to occur, the token’s market cap would need to exceed $14.08 trillion, which is only feasible if the total crypto market surpasses $100 trillion. ChatGPT views this scenario as highly improbable without significant shifts in global financial systems. Challenges to Reaching These Price Points While the projections from Grok and ChatGPT suggest potential paths for the asset to achieve these milestones, the challenges are significant. Each target requires substantial growth in market capitalization, broader adoption of blockchain technology, and increased use cases specific to the asset. The $100 milestone, in particular, would demand unprecedented market conditions, including the cryptocurrency market becoming a dominant force in global finance. These projections underscore the speculative nature of such price targets, emphasizing the need for caution in interpreting long-term forecasts. The digital asset’s potential to reach higher price levels depends on various factors, including market dynamics, technological advancements, and strategic adoption. While the possibility of the token hitting $10 or $20 appears within reach over the next two decades, targets like $50 and $100 remain highly uncertain.

Tron’s token burn is creating scarcity and raising interest. But can the Rollblock crypto presale beat them? With its unique casino-linked rewards and earning options, Rollblock could be the surprise winner as the crypto market gains momentum. Rollblock crypto presale: Bridging gaming and crypto to outshine Tron and Avalanche In the online gambling market, the number of users is expected to hit 281.3 million by 2029, according to Statista. This booming market opens huge opportunities, and Rollblock is stepping in to shake things up. Rollblock is a GambleFi protocol that bridges decentralized and traditional gaming, giving users the best of both worlds. It stands out as one of the first community-backed crypto casinos, where holding the $RBLK token lets users earn a share of casino revenues. The Rollblock crypto presale, now trading at $0.043, has already raised over $7.4 million, proving the strong demand for its unique model. Unlike other cryptos, Rollblock ensures economic stability by using part of the casino’s profits to buy back RBLK tokens. This reduces supply and helps boost the token’s value, protecting investors even during market dips. With a growing online gambling market and Rollblock’s community-focused approach, it could easily outshine established cryptos like Tron and Avalanche . The Rollblock crypto presale is your chance to join a project this altcoin season that’s set to disrupt the casino and gaming world. Avalanche9000 upgrade: The altcoin game-changer simplifying blockchain development The Avalanche 9000 upgrade brings big changes, making it cheaper and easier to create and run blockchains on the Avalanche network. With the new Etna upgrade, costs to launch Layer 1 blockchains have dropped by 99.9%, and transaction fees on the C-Chain are now 96% lower. This opens the door for developers to build custom blockchains with features like flexible staking and token setups. A key highlight is the new Interchain Messaging feature. It allows blockchains on Avalanche to easily share tokens, NFTs, and other data with each other. These updates make Avalanche a strong choice for developers and position it as a top choice this altcoin season with practical uses and long-term potential. Justin Sun’s bold burn: will scarcity ignite Tron’s future? Justin Sun, the founder of Tron , announced a bold plan to burn 100% of the revenue from SUN tokens. This burn strategy aims to reduce the overall token supply, making the tokens scarcer and potentially more valuable. By committing to transparency and addressing technical concerns, Sun seeks to boost investor confidence and solidify the Tron ecosystem as a competitive player in the crypto space. This burn initially sparked excitement, leading to a price spike of Tron’s TRX token, reaching $0.45. However, the market cooled this altcoin season , and the price gradually dropped to $0.25 by the end of the month, highlighting ongoing volatility despite the burn’s long-term potential. Rollblock is flipping the script on GambleFi – are you ready to play? The crypto space is always busy with innovation— Avalanche is slashing fees, Tron is burning tokens, but Rollblock? It’s rewriting the rules of GambleFi! If you’re eyeing something beyond the ordinary, Rollblock’s unique revenue-sharing model could be your golden ticket. So, why just watch?

37953455,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666188,1734847254,"Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Peak Lies Above $225,000, The Timeline Will Shock You","As of December 21, 2024, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $98,600, reflecting a 3.4% increase from its previous close. This rise is part of a broader trend marked by substantial price fluctuations in the past seven days, which saw Bitcoin breaking below close support levels. Particularly, Bitcoin’s price movement in the past few days has been filled with declines below the $100,000 price level and liquidations across the entire crypto industry. Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Surge Above $225,000 By June 2025 Among the many voices weighing in on Bitcoin’s future trajectory is Adrian Zduńczyk, a renowned cryptocurrency analyst better known as CRYPTO₿IRB. While sharing his insights on X, the analyst noted that Bitcoin’s current bull run is already 80% complete, with the remaining 20% expected to be the most exhilarating phase. According to Zduńczyk, this phase will push the Bitcoin price to unprecedented heights in the first half of 2025. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price And Its Weekly Golden Cross: Why The Crash To $0.31 Remains Natural Speaking of the bull run being 80% complete, the current market cycle arguably began in October 2023, when applications of Spot Bitcoin ETFs triggered euphoria among crypto investors. At that time, Bitcoin was trading around $26,000, but the ensuing rally saw it breaking above multiple price resistance levels in quick succession. This, in turn, led to a break above its then all-time high to cross above $70,000 in March 2024, and then the latest break above the $100,000 psychological threshold in December 2024. As CRYPTO₿IRB predicted, the current bull run has played out to about 80% of its trajectory, with only 20% left to play out. Calculations show that Bitcoin has already increased by about 315% since the bull run started about a year ago. However, the analyst’s projection suggests that the leading cryptocurrency is about to make another 110% increase from its current all-time high in the next six months. Particularly, Zduńczyk has projected that Bitcoin will peak at an astonishing price of over $225,000 by June 2025. Altseason To Follow Bitcoin’s Peak, Bear Market Lurks Beyond 2025 Zduńczyk anticipates that a major altseason, which is characterized by explosive gains across the altcoin market, will occur after Bitcoin reaches its projected peak. However, he cautioned investors to remain vigilant, warning that 2026 will likely usher in a bear market and potentially bring in losses between 80% and 90% from the highs of various cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: XRP Price Crash: Analyst Says Don’t Get Distracted As RSI Is Still Above A Bullish 50% His advice to the crypto community is clear: “Realize gains and run before 2025 ends.” The analyst also hinted at a significant development scheduled for December 27, which he cryptically referred to as a “big release,” though details remain undisclosed at this moment. Although CRYPTO₿IRB’s prediction is bullish, it pales in comparison to projections from other crypto analysts, with some putting Bitcoin’s peak above $1 million in the current market cycle.

Their price movements are driven more by sentiment and social media hype than utility or fundamentals, causing memes like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin to plummet harder than most assets when enthusiasm wanes. Gaming coins have the added benefit of harnessing utility alongside massive hype potential. Within this sector, Rollblock is poised to be the next trailblazer during its tentative presale. Here’s why investors are bullish. Rollblock Is Poised To Become The Next Gaming Trailblazer Rollblock is transforming the GameFi landscape with its advanced ERC-20 platform, offering robust security, engaging rewards, and significant growth potential. Analysts anticipate that Rollblock could experience notable expansion during the peak of the bull run, with possible gains during the projected market recovery and altcoin season in Q1-Q2 2025. A key factor in these optimistic projections is Rollblock’s extensive game library, featuring over 7,000 titles ranging from casino classics like poker and blackjack to exclusive blockchain-only games. The platform plans to launch at least a dozen additional games in Q1, along with its recently added sports betting feature, continually enhancing its versatility. Central to Rollblock’s ecosystem is the RBLK token, powering its play-to-earn model and revenue-sharing program. This program uses Rollblock’s revenue to buy RBLK tokens from the open market. These tokens are then burned to make RBLK deflationary, with 40% of repurchased tokens being used for staking rewards. A Meme Is A Meme: Dogecoin Not Immune To Market Crash Dogecoin has faced significant pressure amid the shock crypto market crash, with its price plummeting by 27% as Bitcoin dropped to $93,000. The broader market downturn, fueled by the hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve’s recent FOMC meeting, has fostered an unequivocally bearish environment for coins like Dogecoin. In the long term, Dogecoin is expected to bounce back as its cultural significance and backing by high-profile figures like Elon Musk solidify Dogecoin’s status as the top meme coin. Musk’s ongoing interest and hints about integrating Dogecoin into the X platform continue to generate optimism about its utility and adoption, and as market conditions stabilize and liquidity increases from anticipated fiscal and monetary stimulus globally, Dogecoin could regain significant ground as cryptocurrencies biggest meme coin by some distance. Shiba Inu’s Positive Q4 Bounceback Thwarted By Sudden Market Capitulation After reaching $0.000033 and rekindling investor interest early in Q4, Shiba Inu has declined by over 20% this past week. Bitcoin’s correction below $95,000 has created headwinds for speculative assets like Shiba Inu, decimating the promising momentum Shiba Inu built earlier in the quarter in anticipation of the bull run. Many Shiba Inu investors nevertheless remain optimistic. More than 60% of Shiba Inu holders are still in profit, and Shiba Inu is likely to continue dominating the meme coin landscape as the second largest meme, supported by a loyal community and massive hype. Get Into Rollblock Before The Gaming Rally Of 2025 Given that the recent market crash mirrors 2020’s down to its timing and scope preceding a major altcoin season in the following months in 2021, it’s clear that this shakeout is likely temporary. When investors are fearful, that is the time to accumulate. Currently priced at $0.043 in its ninth presale phase and recently licensed by GamingArjouan, RBLK offers an opportunity to purchase a potential 100x gem early in its lifespan.

Many whales are talking about Cardano’s potential rally to $6, but they are most excited about crypto casino Rollblock’s 1000% potential. This top altcoin has created a next-generation online gambling experience and is looking at explosive growth when its crypto presale ends. Rollblock Tops Whale Interest With Enormous Revenue Potential Rollblock is a revolutionary next-generation GambleFi protocol set to disrupt the $500 billion casino industry. The global gambling industry is ripe for a blockchain technology revolution, with a rapidly increasing share of this revenue moving online each day. Legacy online gambling sites are still slow, dull and riddled with red tape and hidden fees. Rollblock’s casino of more than 7,000 games and sports betting is changing this. Rollblock’s platform operates on the blockchain, which means fast, seamless and transparent access from anywhere in the world through over 20 different crypto tokens. Rollblock has also enhanced the player experience through the latest in UX design and a community-focused approach. This community focus includes a generous suite of rewards programs and fresh events each month. However, its most important element is its game-changing profit-sharing system. Rollblock’s system works through buybacks that employ a portion of the casino’s weekly revenue. These buybacks share profit back with the community through either burn events that increase RBLK’s value or through staking rewards that are competitive with current industry standards. $RBLK tokens are currently selling out fast during stage nine of its presale, with tokens valued at $0.043. With early investors already seeing returns of over 300% experts are making extremely bullish predictions of over 800% returns going into 2025. Cardano Midnight Upgrade Sets Course for $6 by 2026 Cardano is also seeing massive whale interest thanks to its imminent Midnight upgrade. The Midnight upgrade will see Cardano build a sidechain dedicated to processing transactions that limit public information. This will make Cardano the ideal platform for DeFi applications that need to confirm transactions while hiding the details involved. The Cardano price is expected to increase to over $6 by 2026 on this rapid DeFi expansion. This would be an over 500% increase from the current price and more than double its all-time high from 2021. Dogecoin to Be Meme Coin of 2025 Thanks to Trump Presidency The Dogecoin price is expected to continue its association with Elon Musk and the Donald Trump presidency in 2025. This association could send the Dogecoin price as much as 1000% higher as Trump and Musk dominate the headlines for the year. Dogecoin has been the top meme coin destination for crypto enthusiasts looking to celebrate Trump’s win and Musk’s creation of the Department of Government Efficiency. This association already took Dogecoin 500% higher in November with Dogecoin currently trading at $0.2892. Rollblock Top Altcoin for Crypto Whale Portfolios in 2025 While Dogecoin and Cardano look promising for 2025, Rollblock is the undisputed top altcoin for crypto whales. With experts predicting a huge 100x rally out of its crypto presale, Rollblock is being added to whale portfolios now before it is too late.

37952182,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26895,1734844740,"Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK) Solana Memecoin to Rally 18,000% Ahead of Exchange Listing, While SHIB and DOGE Lag","Electric Elon Musk could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did. Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/electric-elon-musk-elecmusk-solana-memecoin-to-rally-18000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-while-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37952175,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396148,1734844680,"Litecoin, HBAR ETFs Speculation Soars – Lunex Gains Steam Amid Explosive Price Forecasts","The post Litecoin, HBAR ETFs Speculation Soars – Lunex Gains Steam Amid Explosive Price Forecasts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Litecoin is on its way to the moon now, and reports indicate a higher likelihood for the SEC to greenlight a Litecoin ETF thanks to Litecoin’s less contentious legal status. This bullish outlook could see Litecoin’s price surge past its $127 resistance zone and retrace a price above $150. The bullish setup building up around Litecoin’s price coincides with increased accumulation from LTC miners that has recently pushed Litecoin’s price to gain 35%. HBAR ETFs are also in the pipeline, according to predictions from market watchers, and Hadera’s ecosystem is only growing. Adding to the list of crypto projects on track for massive gains in 2025 is Lunex’s LNEX token, which has seen its price surge over 283%, rising from a presale entry price of $0.0012 to $0.0046. Its ongoing presale has already raised over $5.3 million. Find out more. Lunex Network Facilitates Deep Liquidity Revolutionising DEFI Lunex is reinventing the entire DeFi sector with a protocol that removes the complexities and security risks that fund losses for DEX traders. Lunex Network is a hybrid DEX and aggregator created with both on-chain and off-chain elements in a move to deliver the world’s first deep liquidity DEX. The latest projections forecast a DeFi market growth of $231 billion by 2030, and LNEX is on track to lead the charge thanks to its multi-chain compatibility, which offers users access to more than 50,000 currency pairs. You don’t need to connect your wallet address to get started; a simple receiving address from your non-custodial wallet is sufficient. With each trade on Lunex, its aggregator works in the background to deliver the most liquid pair at affordable network fees. This enables speedy transaction finality. With only 50% of LNEX tokens up for grabs, now is the ideal time to jump into the presale, given that analysts anticipate an uptick on launch. Litecoin’s Price Rebounds At The $100 Mark Amid A Market-wide Dip After surging to $137, Litecoin’s price consolidated around the $120 region and is now seeking support at the $100 price mark following the market-wide sell-off after the unexpectedly slow interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Even so, Litecoin’s price maintains its bullish appeal, with on-chain data revealing an increased rate of accumulation from LTC miners. Also, Litecoin’s ETF prospects are gaining momentum, with speculators anticipating a bullish resurgence in Litecoin’s price past its previous ATH. Speculation Concerning HBAR ETFs Rises as HBAR’s Price Rebounds at $0.26 After surging over 100% to prices as high as $0.39, HBAR is now rebounding with established support in the $0.26 region. Some fundamentals supporting HBAR’s price ascent include Hadera’s Consensus Service in creating an immutable ledger of AI computing, as seen by NVIDIA and Intel’s unveiling of “Verifiable Compute.” Further adding to this bullish sentiment, analysts on Wall Street are predicting an HBAR ETF approval alongside Litecoin’s ETFs thanks to the alignment of both projects with regulatory perspectives. Conclusion When all’s said and done, the likely approval of Litecoin and HBAR ETFs is a bullish signal that could see the two altcoins surge to new heights. Fortunately, LNEX token holders no longer have to wait for massive gains, as seen by LNEX’s recent uptick. Can LNEX’s gains surpass LTC and HBAR?

37952084,https://nulltx.com/?p=136200,1734844548,"Don’t Miss the Best New Meme Coins to Join in December, as This Viral Presale Brings Back Stage 7 Prices","The meme coin market is alive with energy as 2024 nears its end.

Its loyal community ensures it remains a significant player in the space, offering potential for explosive growth. 5. Bonk (BONK): The Solana-Based Meme Star Bonk has emerged as a standout meme coin on the Solana blockchain, leveraging the network’s high-speed transactions and low fees to carve out a unique position. Its launch was met with immediate attention, thanks to massive airdrops, and its seamless integration into the Solana ecosystem has given it a technological edge. Being built on Solana enables Bonk to deliver practical utility alongside its meme appeal, making it a strong contender for long-term investment.

37951035,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313662,1734842432,The Altcoin Landscape in 2025 – Potential Contenders for Outperforming Bitcoin,"HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post As the CEO of a pioneering crypto-focused mini-app within Telegram, I am deeply engaged in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, consistently monitoring market trends and technological innovations. In my professional opinion, supported by the consensus among researchers and industry experts, Solana (SOL) demonstrates significant potential for exceptional growth in the coming years. Here are the key reasons behind this assessment. Memecoin mania – Catalyst for Solana’s market cap dominance In my professional opinion, Solana’s trajectory has been nothing short of remarkable. Its growth has not only matched Bitcoin ‘s impressive 140% surge this year but has consistently outperformed many of its peers. What’s truly exciting is that this could be just the beginning of Solana’s rise . The crypto community is buzzing about Solana’s potential, and for good reason. Its technological superiority is undeniable, with transaction speeds that dwarf those of Ethereum . This blazing performance is attracting developers and users alike, positioning Solana as the premier platform for DApps (decentralized applications) and DeFi (decentralized finance) projects. Many industry analysts, researchers and developers are particularly bullish on Solana’s prospects. As of November 2024, Solana has already reached around $250, with a market cap of over $100 billion. Some of them predict that Solana will break through resistance levels and potentially reach $400 to $750 in the near future. From my perspective, a memecoin mania has been a significant driver of Solana’s growth, catapulting it to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, surpassing BNB . The Solana ecosystem now hosts over 1,000 memecoins with a combined market cap of over $20 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of over $6.8 billion. However, this is likely just the beginning of Solana’s trajectory. As we look toward 2025, the network is poised for even greater adoption as ‘serious’ projects begin to recognize and leverage Solana’s technological advantages. Furthermore, Solana’s growing dominance in the DeFi sector is evident in its rapidly increasing TVL (total value locked). In fact, some DEXs (decentralized exchanges) on Solana are now seeing higher trading activity than their Ethereum counterparts. This shift in the DeFi landscape could be the catalyst that propels Solana to new heights. Solving trillion-dollar inefficiencies in financial markets Chainlink (LINK) is another altcoin that I believe has immense potential. As an oracle network, Chainlink plays a critical role in connecting blockchain smart contracts to real-world data. But what really excites me about Chainlink is its strategic pivot toward asset tokenization . This move aligns perfectly with the growing trend of bringing traditional financial assets to the blockchain. The potential market for tokenized assets is staggering, with some estimates suggesting it could be worth trillions by 2030. By partnering with major financial institutions to facilitate this transition, Chainlink could position itself at the forefront of a financial revolution. LINK is no longer just a crypto project – it is positioning itself as the backbone of a decentralized financial market infrastructure, solving trillion-dollar inefficiencies. Limited supply meets unlimited AI potential Finally, I hold the view that Bittensor (TAO) represents an intriguing intersection of two of the hottest trends in tech – cryptocurrency and AI (artificial intelligence). With a limited supply of 21 million coins, mirroring Bitcoin’s scarcity model, Bittensor has built-in deflationary pressure. As the demand for AI solutions continues to grow, Bittensor’s role in enabling decentralized AI networks could drive significant value appreciation. However, it’s important to note that the AI crypto space is still in its infancy and highly volatile. While Bittensor shows promise, investors should be prepared for rapid shifts in market sentiment. In conclusion, looking at the broader market, recent market forecasts predict that by 2025 we could see spot ETH ETFs (exchange-traded funds) with more than $10 billion in assets and the tokenization of more than $1 trillion in RWAs (real-world assets). These trends bode well for the altcoins I’ve highlighted – particularly Solana and Chainlink. In my assessment, while Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the crypto market , these altcoins offer unique value propositions that could drive outperformance in 2025. Solana’s speed and growing DeFi ecosystem, Chainlink’s pivotal role in asset tokenization and Bittensor’s position at the intersection of crypto and AI make them compelling options for investors looking to diversify their crypto portfolios.

37950739,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666165,1734841838,"Bitcoin Drops Below $100,000: The End Or Beginning Of The Crypto Bull Market?","Bitcoin, the titan of the cryptocurrency world with a market cap hovering around $1.9 trillion, has experienced a significant downturn, dipping below the psychological threshold of $100,000. This flash dump, occurring over just three days, has left many investors and analysts questioning whether this marks the end of the current bull market or signals a healthy correction within an ongoing bullish trend. Temporary Setback Or Trend Reversal? The price action has been particularly notable this week, with Bitcoin breaking through the $100,000 support level, which had held strong for eight consecutive days. Market analysts point to several factors contributing to this decline. One significant influence is the market makers’ strategy, which involved driving the price upward to encourage traders to open long positions at around $98,000, thereby increasing liquidity. Related Reading: Is This The Bottom? Experts Weigh In On Bitcoin 13% Dip And Potential Recovery After exhausting this liquidity, market makers strategically used Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech as a catalyst to drive a downward price movement, effectively filling the price inefficiencies at $93,744 (50%) and $90,513 (100%). Analysts explained, “The Bitcoin drop was necessary as there were inefficiencies below the price that needed to be filled, which are $93,744 for 50% and $90,513 for 100%. The inefficiency rule states that traders must fill either 50% or 100% of the inefficiency.” They added that market makers “purposely took the price upward to induce traders to open long positions, thereby increasing the liquidity at $98,000. Exhausted market makers decided to wipe out the liquidity at $98,800 and used Powell’s speech as a catalyst to fuel the downward movement.” Experts now predict a bounce to $101,000 before either a pullback or a continuation of the trend, as the $93,788-$92,200 range currently acts as robust support. This zone has seen significant buy orders, aligning with the 50% inefficiency recently filled. A bounce from this level appears inevitable. BlackRock And Institutional Moves Signal Confidence In Bitcoin Amid the volatility, BlackRock, one of the world’s leading asset management firms, has made headlines for its substantial investments in Bitcoin. According to insights from Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock has not only net bought Bitcoin while other ETFs were selling but has also amassed a considerable amount, now holding 122.6K BTC. This makes BlackRock the 11th largest holder of Bitcoin, controlling roughly 0.6% of the circulating supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes: Here’s Where The Nearest On-Chain Support Is Their aggressive accumulation, including a recent $1.5 billion purchase, contrasts sharply with the broader market’s net selling of $785 million in BTC this week. BlackRock’s actions have sparked discussions on platforms like X, with many applauding or humorously noting their transition from traditional assets to digital currencies. Additionally, BlackRock’s involvement in the crypto market was underscored by their BUIDL Fund receiving $100 million USDC, signaling a strategic pivot towards digital assets. Such a heavyweight in finance could interpret this move as a vote of confidence in the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies, potentially influencing market sentiment and dynamics. Market Sentiment: Fear Or Opportunity? The market’s current sentiment, as measured by the Fear and Greed Index, remains in the ‘greed’ zone at 62, indicating minimal fear among investors. Instead, the dip below $100,000 is viewed by many as a buying opportunity, with expectations of an imminent recovery. Analysts predict a bounce back to around $101,000 before any significant pullback or continuation of the current trend, supported by robust buying at the $93,788-$92,200 range, which aligns with the recently filled 50% inefficiency level.

Amid this mild bearish market sentiment, traders and investors appear hesitant to participate in the altcoin, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Analyzing recent on-chain metrics alongside technical analysis suggests a fine outlook for Cardano (ADA) . While long-term holders show optimism, as evidenced by significant outflows from exchanges, technical patterns indicate potential short-term bearish trends. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, ADA appears bearish as it has successfully broken down from a head-and-shoulders price action pattern and recently retested that level. This retest of the breakdown level has partially confirmed that ADA is poised for a price decline. Source: Trading View Based on the technical analysis, there is a strong possibility that the altcoin could drop by 15% to reach the next support level at the $0.80 mark. If this sentiment remains unchanged, it will be easy for ADA to achieve the predicted target. Optimistic On-Chain Metrics Despite the bearish technical analysis, long-term holders seem optimistic about ADA, as reported by Coinglass . According to data from ADA spot inflow/outflow, exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $200 million worth of ADA in the past week. However, there has not been a single inflow during this period, despite a notable price decline. This trend represents the movement of assets from long-term holders’ wallets away from exchanges. It suggests that investors are bullish and accumulating tokens amid the price crash, indicating potential upside momentum and an ideal buying opportunity. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.89, having experienced a price decline of over 5.5% in the past 24 hours.

These alternative cryptocurrencies have carved out niches for themselves, offering innovative tech, specialised use cases, and often, insane growth potential. And let’s be real, who doesn’t want to catch the next big thing before it rockets to the moon? As we wrap up 2024, three standout projects are generating major buzz among crypto enthusiasts: Qubetics (TICS) , Arbitrum (ARB), and EOS (EOS). While each brings something unique to the table, they’re united by their reputation as some of the best coins to buy now. Here’s the lowdown on why these three deserve a closer look, starting with the new kid on the block, Qubetics. Qubetics: Revolutionising Crypto with Multi-Chain Innovation Let’s talk about Qubetics. This isn’t just another crypto presale hyped up on social media; it’s a game-changer in the making. Qubetics is in its 13th presale stage , and the numbers don’t lie. With over 365 million $TICS tokens sold to more than 11,100 holders, this project has already raised a whopping $7.4 million. At just $0.0342 per token, $TICS is shaping up to be one of the best coins to buy now. But you might want to act fast—the price is set to jump by 10% this weekend. The Qubetics Multi-Chain Wallet is a standout feature. Imagine managing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even obscure tokens from different blockchains—all in one sleek app. For freelancers working globally, it means getting paid in crypto without stressing over which wallet supports what. For businesses? Seamless transactions across chains. And for the average Joe? No more juggling half a dozen apps. Say you’re in New York paying for coffee with Bitcoin or travelling in Europe and switching to local cryptos; Qubetics’ wallet makes it effortless. What really has analysts talking are the price predictions. By the end of the presale, $TICS is expected to hit $0.25, delivering a jaw-dropping 630% ROI. Post-presale, it’s forecasted to soar to $5, a mind-boggling 14,500% ROI. And after its mainnet launch? A potential $15 per token, translating to a whopping 43,711% ROI. Do the math: a $100,000 investment now could balloon into $14.6 million if $TICS reaches $5. Its numbers like these that have everyone scrambling to get in. Arbitrum: The Layer-2 Powerhouse Arbitrum isn’t some fly-by-night altcoin. This Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum has been around the block, proving its worth as one of the best coins to buy now for anyone serious about decentralised finance (DeFi). Built to tackle Ethereum’s infamous gas fees and slow transaction times, Arbitrum has become a favourite for developers and users alike. In 2024, Arbitrum has cemented its position as a DeFi leader, hosting projects from lending protocols to decentralised exchanges. Its ability to process thousands of transactions per second while slashing costs has made it indispensable. For instance, a user might pay $50 in gas fees on Ethereum—but with Arbitrum, it’s just pennies. It’s no wonder the ecosystem has seen billions locked in its protocols. Arbitrum’s ARB token plays a central role here, and it’s been steadily climbing the ranks. Known for its consistent performance, ARB has become a go-to investment for those seeking stability in the volatile crypto space. And let’s not forget the potential for staking and governance rewards. Whether you’re a retail investor or a whale, ARB’s utility and growth trajectory make it a no-brainer. What’s cool about Arbitrum is its adaptability. Picture this: you’re running a DeFi project and need a solution that scales with demand without breaking the bank. Arbitrum’s got your back. Or maybe you’re just a casual user sick of Ethereum’s fees. Either way, it delivers. With Ethereum 2.0 still ironing out kinks, Arbitrum fills a critical gap. It’s not just a stopgap solution; it’s setting the standard for what Layer-2 should look like. And that’s why it’s consistently among the best coins to buy now, with analysts expecting more growth as DeFi adoption expands. EOS: The OG of Scalable Blockchain EOS might not be the shiny new toy in the crypto world, but don’t sleep on it. Launched in 2018, EOS was one of the first blockchains to seriously tackle scalability. It promised high throughput and low fees, making it a pioneer in the race to dethrone Ethereum. While newer competitors have emerged, EOS remains a solid pick for those looking for the best coins to buy now. The EOS network is known for its Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, which enables fast, cheap transactions. This makes it ideal for developers building dApps that need speed and efficiency. From gaming to supply chain solutions, EOS has been a backbone for countless projects. EOS’s journey hasn’t been without hiccups. Early controversies around centralisation and governance led to a dip in its popularity. But 2024 has been a comeback year, with renewed developer interest and a push to re-establish itself as a leader in the blockchain space. The EOS token has regained traction, and its affordability makes it an attractive entry point for new investors. Think about it: if you’re a business launching a global app, you want a blockchain that won’t crash under pressure. That’s where EOS shines. Its scalability and efficiency have kept it relevant, even as the market evolves. And for long-term holders, the token’s history of resilience offers a sense of security rarely found in crypto.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-fires-powell-trumppow-solana-memecoin-will-surge-15000-before-exchange-listing-while-shib-and-pepe-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37949016,https://crypto.news/?p=14321377,1734838420,Whales accumulate millions in this altcoin expected to lead Solana and XRP In 2025,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rollblock, an AI-powered GambleFi protocol, is gaining attention as it challenges Solana and Ripple, with analysts predicting a 50x-100x rally in 2025. Table of Contents Millions of RBLK purchased by investors Is Solana running out of steam? Ripple Price Remains Steady Rollblock a clear favorite among whales A promising new altcoin is expected to take off in 2025 at the expense of major cryptos such as Ripple and Solana. Solana has been unable to follow the price pattern of Bitcoin and has reached a resistance mark around the $220 level. While down 5% in 24 hours, Ripple is performing a little better than the wider market on a monthly basis, trading at just $0.50 in early November. The new altcoin presale that whales are investigating is Rollblock (RBLK) , an AI-powered GambleFi protocol that looks to disrupt traditional casinos. Analysts have suggested that this coin could rally 50x to 100x if market conditions are correct, which is one reason why whales have been migrating to this particular presale. You might also like: Amid market correction, ETH, TON traders see benefits of Rollblock’s deflationary crypto Millions of RBLK purchased by investors Rollblock is a fully licensed, regulated, and secure crypto casino designed to change online gaming. Easily accessible, the platform hosts over 7000 game modes and recently added a sports betting mode that covers most major sports. In addition to its games Rollblock also introduces a revenue share model. As part of this model up to 30% of casino revenue is used to buy RBLK tokens from the market. These are split 60:40 to a dedicated token burn (60%) and staking APY (40%). This makes RBLK deflationary while investors can enjoy a passive income stream. The presale further aims to democratize the centralized gambling industry with instant crypto deposits and easy email sign-up, breaking apart a gigantic $450 million sector. Transparent blockchain analytics on betting history empower users to understand where the funds are going and what they are entitled to. With a wildly turbulent crypto market, it is little surprise that whales are investing in Rollblock. The token price is steeply discounted at $0.043, set to increase to $0.047 in the next round. Moreover, a 20% limited presale bonus is another incentive to purchase the coin before it skyrockets, not after. This is the lowest possible price for RBLK. The presale has raised $7.4 million so far and it has nearly breached its soft cap of $10 million. The crypto casino is already live for play throughout the presale, with a minimum viable product before the fundraising rounds have even been finalized. Is Solana running out of steam? Solana was the best-performing top 20 coin in 2023. After plummeting swiftly due to association with the FTX scandal, Solana went from $9 in December 2022, to $112 in December 2023. The bull run continued all the way to its recent November high of $257, while it currently trades at $181. However, whether Solana can sustain these price movements remains questionable. Even with positive news such as Solana ETP staking in Europe and the likely approval of a Solana Spot ETF in the USA, Solana could easily be described as an overbought token. $181 is not a discounted price for a token that sold for $9 less than 2 years ago. More concerning is the underreported fact that altcoins like Solana no longer seem to have such a strong positive correlation with Bitcoin. Ripple Price Remains Steady Ripple has been one of the best-performing mainstream tokens, with a 5x price rise from early November to its current price of $2.09. This is great news to those who bought at the low in early November. However, Ripple is in a similar position to Solana in terms of investment potential – it’s too late to enter the market. Late-stage investors are paying a premium for an overbought token. Like Solana, it has plenty of updates, partnerships, and upgrades. Ripple’s dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, recently launched on major exchanges. In November, an XRP ETF application was filed in Delaware, and whales also bought over 50 million Ripple tokens. Rollblock a clear favorite among whales RBLK remains a clear winner compared to overpriced coins such as Ripple and Solana, as evidenced by Whale investment. It has a strong use case and offers high growth as a presale with early investors already up over 330%! For more information, visit the Rollblock presale website and join the online community.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. The crypto space heats up with Rollblock, Dogecoin, and Cardano vying for dominance in 2025, with Rollblock raising $7.4M. Table of Contents Rollblock: Redefining eGaming and poised to dominate the gambling industry Dogecoin’s bears may soon dominate the market as challenges looms Cardano balances challenges with strong growth drivers Rollblock’s recent milestones boost its potential The crypto space is heating up as investors eye the potential of Rollblock , Dogecoin, and Cardano for 2025. While Dogecoin rides on its meme appeal and Cardano pushes creativity with its blockchain technology, Rollblock is turning heads with its real-world gambling solutions and fresh approach. Each offers unique opportunities, but which one holds the edge for growth? Notably, Rollblock has already raised $7.4 million in its ICO so far. You might also like: DeFi ecosystem for BTC, says Hoskinson; Rollblock early backers to take advantage Rollblock: Redefining eGaming and poised to dominate the gambling industry Rollblock is an eGaming casino that is set to alter the gambling market. This project provides secure, fair gaming and complete regulatory compliance with a Curacao eGaming License. Rollblock utilizes Ethereum to encrypt all bets and is tamper-proof, providing complete transparency and trust for its users. The platform just recently got approval from the Anjouan Gaming Authority, known for establishing the gold standard for internet gambling regulation. This seal of approval signifies that Rollblock’s extensive platform, featuring over 7,000 casino games and sports betting options, meets the highest industry benchmarks for security and reliability. Boasting a thriving community of 25,000 gamers, Rollblock generates significant daily revenue. A portion of this income is redistributed weekly through a unique revenue-sharing model that buys RBLK tokens from the open market. Users can stake 40% of these tokens for some of the highest APYs in crypto while the remaining 60% is burned, driving scarcity and boosting value. The platform’s presale has already raised over $7.4 million, with tokens priced at $0.043. Experts predict an explosive trajectory once Rollblock officially launches in 2025. Positioned to capitalize on the rapidly growing $540 billion online gaming market—projected to reach $800 billion in five years — Rollblock is set to carve out a significant share. Dogecoin’s bears may soon dominate the market as challenges looms Dogecoin dipped over 29% this last week to $0.28 after briefly reaching $0.48. Additionally, Dogecoin slipped below the key $0.39 support level, indicating some recent volatility. Dogecoin has traded in a consolidation phase between $0.49 and $0.35 in the last 4 weeks. Regardless of the fluctuations, several holders in the Dogecoin community remain optimistic, expecting a rally. On-chain data shows considerable whale accumulation, indicating big investors are positioning themselves for future gains in the Dogecoin ecosystem. However, Dogecoin faces challenges. DOGE was developed in 2013 as an enjoyable alternative to Bitcoin and has a zero supply cap. This means that 10,000 tokens are produced every minute, and right now, the memecoin has 147 billion coins in circulation and is inflationary — triggering worry among potential investors. Additionally, Dogecoin ranks poorly in developer activity, and analysts fear that this could hinder innovation and adoption. Cardano balances challenges with strong growth drivers Cardano (ADA) is navigating a tough price environment, trading below the $1.00 mark and drawing attention from traders. After failing to sustain momentum above $1.12, Cardano saw a pullback, stabilizing near $0.9151. It remains below key levels, including the 100-hourly simple moving average, giving bears a short-term edge. However, Cardano has strong fundamentals driving optimism. Its Hydra layer-2 solution promises faster, cheaper transactions, boosting its appeal for developers and dApps. With over 70% of ADA staked, the network showcases strong community trust. Cardano’s partnerships, like its blockchain integration in Ethiopia’s education system, highlight its real-world applications. Additionally, ADA’s energy-efficient proof-of-stake system aligns with the growing demand for sustainable blockchain solutions. Technical indicators, including RSI and support/resistance levels, suggest potential for upward momentum, keeping analysts bullish on Cardano’s long-term prospects. Rollblock’s recent milestones boost its potential Rollblock’s recent Solid Proof and Anjouan Gaming Authority positions it as the crypto with a greater 2025 potential, potentially better than Cardano and Dogecoin. Backed by unique technology and strong community support, Rollblock stands as a compelling altcoin with immense potential for reshaping the gambling industry.

The latest chatter in the crypto streets has all eyes on meme coins. While Goatseus Maximus and ANDY face a downturn, BTFD Coin is stealing the spotlight with its presale discount, creating waves across the community. If you’ve been snoozing, you might’ve missed the memo—BTFD Coin is surging past milestones faster than a caffeine-fueled day trader. Meanwhile, Goatseus Maximus and ANDY are struggling to hold the line as their value takes a nosedive. Meme coins have been driving crypto mania for years, evolving from jokes to serious investment contenders. Who can forget the Dogecoin frenzy or the meteoric rise of Shiba Inu? But the market’s evolving, and investors are no longer just chasing laughs—they’re seeking solid returns. That’s where BTFD Coin steps in, marrying meme magic with utility and a roadmap that actually gets people talking. What makes BTFD Coin shine isn’t just the hype—it’s the real-world opportunities packed into its ecosystem. From a thrilling play-to-earn (P2E) game to staking rewards and an innovative referral program, BTFD Coin promises to redefine the meme coin game. Add to that its vibrant community backing, and you’ve got a project that’s ready to take meme coin popularity to new heights. BTFD Coin: Turning Dips into Gold “Buy the dip.” It’s the mantra of seasoned investors, and BTFD Coin has built an entire brand around it. The world economy has seen its fair share of chaos—take 1973, for instance, when a major financial crash rocked global markets. History has shown that turbulent times can be gold mines for those bold enough to act. That’s the spirit BTFD Coin embodies—turning market chaos into wealth opportunities. Since launching its presale, BTFD Coin has been on fire. The presale is dominating the scene, letting investors buy at Stage 7 prices while the rest are in Stage 12. At $0.000064, this offers a massive 837.5% ROI at launch. Just use the code BIG50 – because catching dips has never been this profitable. Imagine this: You invest $50,000 at the Stage 7 price of $0.000064. That nets you 781,250,000 coins. When BTFD Coin hits its listing price of $0.0006, your investment skyrockets to $468,750. Yep, you read that right—nearly half a million dollars from a $50K stake. And the best part? You can still grab coins at the discounted Stage 7 price during Stage 12 by using the bonus code BIG50 on their presale page. BTFD isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a whole vibe. The P2E game is designed to hook gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike, while staking rewards offer passive income opportunities. Add in the referral program, where users can earn extra coins for spreading the word, and it’s clear BTFD has thought of everything to keep its community engaged and invested. Goatseus Maximus: From Hype to Hope Goatseus Maximus burst onto the scene with a roar, capturing imaginations with its tongue-in-cheek name and audacious marketing. But lately? The roar’s turned into a whimper. Its price has been on a steady decline, leaving investors scratching their heads and wondering what’s next. The project’s decline isn’t for lack of trying. Goatseus Maximus attempted to pivot with community-driven initiatives and vague promises of future utility. But in the cutthroat meme coin arena, vague doesn’t cut it. Investors crave tangible progress, and without it, confidence erodes. While the coin’s creators are scrambling to revive its fortunes, the clock is ticking, and the market isn’t known for its patience. That’s not to say Goatseus Maximus is dead in the water. If the team can deliver on its promises—or better yet, surprise the market with a game-changing move—it might claw its way back. But for now, it’s hard to see Goatseus Maximus as anything more than a cautionary tale. If you’re holding, you’re likely sweating bullets. If you’re considering buying in, proceed with caution and keep your eyes peeled for signs of a comeback. ANDY: Riding the Meme Coin Rollercoaster ANDY had its moment in the sun, riding a wave of celebrity endorsements and viral memes. But as the saying goes, “What goes up must come down.” And down it’s gone. Once a darling of meme coin enthusiasts, ANDY is now struggling to maintain relevance. The coin’s challenges stem partly from its overreliance on hype. While its initial surge was exhilarating, the lack of a solid roadmap or meaningful utility left ANDY vulnerable to market whims. It’s a classic case of a project flying too close to the sun—all flash, no substance. As the market matures, meme coins without a strong foundation are finding it harder to survive. That’s not to say ANDY is a lost cause. The team has hinted at upcoming developments that could reinvigorate the project. But in a landscape crowded with meme coins promising the moon, ANDY will need to deliver something truly extraordinary to win back investors. Until then, it remains a risky bet, more suited for thrill-seekers than cautious planners.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. ETH’s early investors saw exponential returns. Now, Rexas Finance offers a new opportunity with a potential $20 growth. Table of Contents What is Rexas Finance Why RXS mirrors Ethereum’s early potential Robust tokenomics backing RXS’s growth The new face of the blockchain Conclusion ETH was one of the early blockchain investments that transformed the market. ETH believers were almost exposed to its future price, which would shoot up to approximately $0.66. For instance, when it was first launched in 2015, it was only worth approximately $0.66. Just as predicted, investors saw their initial investment multiply when ETH reached thousands. Luckily for those who missed out on the bullish moves, ETH now has a new investment lookalike, Rexas Finance (RXS) , says Ethereum Bull Touts. Its token, RXS, has a low entry cost, and it’s expected to experience great growth in the upcoming months. They are predicting a potential of $20 for RXS. Whales have accumulated RXS You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted What is Rexas Finance Tokenizing real estate, commodities, and collectibles is a foreign term, but it will redefine economies. Rexas enables investors fractional ownership of RWA. RWA stands for Real World Assets, which reinforces the globalization of financial markets. Rexas Finance is the leader for realigning traditional financial assets into a decentralized ecosystem. However, with such great potential comes a massive barrier to entry and high transaction costs. Still, Rexas makes the purchase easy. Total global RWA is valued at over $379 trillion, which allows Rexas to address major issues within economies of illiquidity and massive costs. With RWA now addressing these major problems, flipping this chart from red to green, the number of pathways to invest in the market is now cheap. Rexas facilitates these pathways with the QuickMint Bot and GenAI systems, making token creation simple and accessible. These technologies allow businesses and individuals to convert assets into tokens easily and reduce the difficulty of trading on blockchain platforms. Why RXS mirrors Ethereum’s early potential The synergy between RXS and Ethereum is fascinating. RXS perfectly depicts the ‘new world’ of digital asset creation, specifically the digital asset trading landscape. Rexas Finance is perfectly positioned to be part of the next big blockchain revolution by reaching out to global markets. Ethereum gained considerable acceptance and growth as a result of its use. In the same vein, RXS’s potential impact on pricing will be seen in its real-world applications and expansion of its environment. Over the next few months, a spike in acceptance has prompted analysts to project RXS could achieve $20 — an amazing 13,233% upsurge relative to its present presale price of $0.15. Robust tokenomics backing RXS’s growth RXS will thrive on the market because the token has been designed with a robust structure of tokenomics, which supports the strategy of balancing acceptance and value increase in the long run. As for RXS, its circulating supply stands at 1 billion tokens, and the distribution is outlined as follows: 42.5% for presale, promoting early engagement in the project. 10% for treasury, building a large global community. 15% for liquidity, fostering multi-exchange trading. 30.5% for staking rewards, marketing, and team engagement, stimulating activity and creativity. This degree of distribution ensures diversity in the ecosystem while enhancing early and consistent holders. Also, the demand for RXS will be driven by the ecosystem’s growth due to its currency utility as a token on the platform. Long-term predictions regarding RXS position it at even higher levels as its growth curve is similar to that of Ethereum, as institutional or mainstream users capitalize on the currency. The new face of the blockchain Although Ethereum’s smart contract and DeFi development changed the game, RXS is poised to be the new face of the following stage of blockchain evolution—the fusion between digital assets and real-world assets. Rexas Finance is a project that tackles multiple real-world problems, such as illiquidity and deficiency, providing immediate use cases and long-term disrupting capabilities. It almost seems like Ethereum investors at $0.66 believed they’d purchased something at the early stages of what would eventually become a new project. Likewise, those purchasing RXS at 0.15 might just be in for the ride of their lives. Conclusion Rexas Finance is no ordinary currency; it is going to change the future by eliminating the barriers of asset ownership and investment while making finance accessible worldwide. It has the potential to tokenize and democratize access to real-world assets, which makes it one of the most unique blockchain projects of this decade. With forecasts predicting RXS to be at $20 in the near term, RXS is positioned towards investors seeking to replicate what early Ethereum investors did, where they made thousands of dollars. The time when cryptocurrencies relied on duplicitous tokens is yet to come; thus, grab RXS altcoin, as this is the monumental moment to do so.

Despite this sharp downturn, XRP has shown resilience, bouncing back with a notable 20% recovery since yesterday. This quick rebound has reignited discussions about XRP’s long-term prospects, even as short-term sentiment remains shaky. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Losses Spike 3 Times The Weekly Average – Healthy Correction Or Downturn? According to data shared by prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez, whales have accumulated 80 million XRP since the correction began on December 17. This surge in whale activity suggests a growing confidence among large investors, who appear to be seizing the opportunity to buy XRP at lower prices. Such accumulation often signals a long-term bullish outlook, even as the broader market navigates periods of uncertainty. While XRP’s recovery is encouraging, it comes amid a backdrop of negative sentiment and price instability. The coming days will likely prove crucial in determining whether XRP can maintain its upward momentum or if further consolidation is on the horizon. For now, whale activity offers a glimmer of optimism, hinting at sustained interest in the asset despite recent setbacks. XRP Whales Loading Up XRP is currently trading 22% below its multi-year high of $2.90, following a period of heightened market volatility. Despite the recent turbulence, XRP has maintained its footing above the $1.90 low—a critical support level that serves as the bulls’ last line of defense. Holding this level is essential for preserving the broader bullish structure and preventing a deeper correction. Recent data from Santiment, shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, highlights a significant development: whales have purchased 80 million XRP since the correction began on December 17. This accumulation by large investors suggests growing confidence in XRP’s long-term potential despite the short-term price decline. Historically, whale activity has often preceded significant price movements, as these investors typically have access to better market insights. If XRP can sustain its position above $2 and begin to push through crucial supply zones, a rapid recovery could follow. Overcoming these resistance levels would likely pave the way for renewed bullish momentum, with the potential to retest multi-year highs.

Holding current levels could signal the start of a new upward trajectory. Testing Liquidity Above $2 XRP is trading at $2.35, marking a strong recovery from its recent dip to $1.95. This rebound underscores the resilience of XRP’s price action, as it continues to hold above key support levels. The $1.95 low has proven to be a pivotal point for bulls, and maintaining this momentum could signal further gains in the coming days. However, for the rally to gain credibility, XRP must reclaim the $2.60 mark. This level serves as a critical resistance point and a confirmation zone for bullish sentiment. Breaking above $2.60 would likely attract more buying interest, propelling XRP toward retesting multi-year highs. On the flip side, a loss of the $2 support level would shift the narrative. Such a move would expose XRP to further downside risks, potentially leading to a deeper correction. Market sentiment remains cautious, and a break below $2 could result in accelerated selling pressure.

The next few sessions will be critical in defining XRP’s short-term trend.

While Pepe and Tron have established their names in the market, Lighchain AI, priced at a modest $0.003 during its presale , is capturing attention for its innovative approach and exponential growth potential. Let’s analyze these projects and uncover which one might become the next top gainer. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Riding the Memecoin Wave Pepe Coin jumped into the crypto world, riding the wave of wins made by well-liked memecoins like Dogecoin and a Shiba Inu. Its fun branding, bright online group and popular ads, it has fast caught the eye of both crypto fans and simple buyers. The climb of Pepe shows the big sway of web culture and jokes in forming crypto trends. But, Pepe’s future mostly rests on group excitement and market feeling instead ͏of clear use or a set plan for growth. The memecoin now misses traits that give real-world worth or lasting reasons to use it, which might affect its ability to last in the long run. For the time being, it grows on guesswork interest, pulling in backers keen for fast gains in an unstable market. Tron (TRX) Steady Contender in Blockchain Utility Tron has been a consistent and prominent player in the blockchain space, carving out a niche by focusing on decentralized content and applications. Launched in 2017, Tron aims to create a global digital entertainment system that allows for secure and cost-effective distribution of content without intermediaries. Its blockchain infrastructure is known for fast transaction speeds, high scalability, and minimal fees, which have made it an attractive choice for developers and enterprises seeking efficient solutions. In addition to powering decentralized applications (dApps), Tron has recently expanded its ecosystem to include decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), further diversifying its use cases. These expansions position Tron as a versatile and multi-dimensional platform. For instance, its DeFi initiatives are aimed at creating open and accessible financial systems, while its foray into NFTs supports the growing demand for digital collectibles and unique tokenized assets. Lighchain AI (LCAI) Newcomer With Revolutionary Potential Lighchain AI stands out as the most promising contender in this trio, thanks to its groundbreaking integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Positioned as a disruptor in the DeFi and AI markets, LCAI brings unmatched innovation and utility. Why Lighchain AI Could Be the Next Big Thing Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) The AIVM enables developers to build AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) across industries like healthcare, finance, and supply chain management. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) A unique consensus mechanism that rewards nodes for performing AI computations, creating value beyond just blockchain validation. Deflationary Tokenomics LCAI employs a deflationary model, burning a portion of transaction fees to reduce supply and increase scarcity, making it an ideal long-term investment. High ROI Potential Priced at just $0.003 during its presale , analysts project a potential rise to $2 by 2025, offering a staggering 6,666% ROI for early adopters. Which Crypto Will Reign Supreme? Lighchain AI a relatively new project, is already generating significant buzz and establishing itself as a formidable competitor to established cryptos like Pepe Coin and Tron. Its innovative features and potential for exponential growth make it an exciting prospect for investors looking to get in on the ground floor. Also the presale success of LCAI a great opportunity to invest before the public sale, which is expected to drive up demand and increase its value. However, Pepe Coin and Tron’s established market presence gives them an edge in terms of current popularity and widespread adoption. Ultimately, the future performance of these cryptocurrencies will depend on various factors such as community support, technological advancements, and wider mainstream acceptance. As always, it is important for investors to perform their own research and due diligence before making any investment decisions. Bright Future for Lighchain AI The crypto market continues to evolve, and projects like Lighchain AI (LCAI) are pushing the boundaries of what blockchain technology can achieve. As Pepe rides the memecoin wave and Tron solidifies its place in DeFi, Lighchain AI offers investors a unique opportunity to be part of a transformative project with real-world impact and exponential growth potential. Whether it will become the next big gainer is yet to be seen, but one thing is for sure LCAI is certainly a promising contender in the crypto world and one to watch closely in the coming years. So, it is safe to say that exciting times lie ahead for all three cryptocurrencies, with each offering unique opportunities and potential for growth. The future of the cryptocurrency market remains unpredictable, making it an exciting space for investors to explore new opportunities and find their next successful investment.

Filecoin, Monero, and Lunex Network dominate savvy investors’ portfolios. Table of Contents Lunex Network: Cross-chain asset exchange poised for explosive crypto gains Analysts predict Filecoin price expansion amid ecosystem development Monero post-crypto gains despite privacy-focused tech adversities Conclusion The recent crypto market surge has proven that there are better days ahead, after all. But the best way to stay ahead of the curve is to follow the smart money. Only three altcoins have dominated savvy investors’ portfolios: Filecoin, Monero, and Lunex Network . Filecoin’s unique solution fuels optimism, and Monero has stayed resilient despite recent adversities. Meanwhile, the new Lunex Network exchange is also making waves with its innovative DEX that has raised dust and over $5.3M in presale. Read on to learn more. You might also like: ADA retests $1.20 while DOGE consolidates below $0.50 – Lunex Network price jumps 200% Lunex Network: Cross-chain asset exchange poised for explosive crypto gains Lunex Network is rapidly gaining attention within the cryptocurrency community thanks to its unique approach to decentralized exchange. Its platform offers a compelling combination of speed, security, and accessibility, setting it apart from traditional exchanges. A key differentiator is Lunex’s extensive interoperability, which supports transactions across more than 40 different blockchains. This expansive reach provides users with unparalleled access to a diverse range of digital assets. To further empower users, Lunex offers a comprehensive portfolio tracker, providing real-time market insights to inform trading decisions. Furthermore, its non-custodial design ensures users retain complete control over their assets and private keys. At the same time, a robust staking program offers attractive APYs of up to 18%, creating additional passive income streams. The platform’s commitment to security is further reinforced by a comprehensive audit conducted by SolidProof, a reputable blockchain security firm. Analysts predict Filecoin price expansion amid ecosystem development Filecoin and its decentralized storage’s transformative potential have made the headlines, too. What started subtly as that democratized file storage and management network has expanded beyond reach. Recently, Filecoin unveiled integration with Akave and Storacha to redefine blockchain-based data management. Analysts predict these advancements could drive Filecoin price crypto gains as demand surges in gaming, AI, and enterprise storage sectors. Beyond this, Filecoin price is getting a bullish outlook at the heel of the network’s AI explorations. Recent collaborations with projects like Ramo and Kite AI underscore its commitment to decentralized, transparent, and scalable AI solutions. Filecoin is solidifying its dominance in the blockchain storage arena, and so is the Filecoin price on the charts. Monero post-crypto gains despite privacy-focused tech adversities Another altcoin showing much resilience and potential is Monero. The leading privacy-focused network is defying challenges with strong crypto gains. Despite the bearish storm and CEX delistings, Monero has painted a picture perfectly. Monero’s price has surged 13% MoM trading, and key technical indicators support optimism. Analysts predict upward movement, eyeing resistance levels at $268 and $333. Amid this market performance, Monero is advancing its privacy technology to confront future risks. Monero developers recently pioneered a quantum-resistant protocol with lattice-based cryptography to secure its blockchain from future computational breakthroughs. This innovation stands as a beacon against technological and regulatory threats that Monero is facing. Conclusion Filecoin, Monero, and Lunex Network represent a compelling trifecta for discerning crypto investors. While Filecoin and Monero may have maxed out their potential, Lunex Network brings a fresh take on DeFi and financial freedom. Its unique cross-chain DEX and rapidly growing presale present a unique opportunity for substantial crypto gains. Stats don’t stutter! Lunex presale has accrued over $5.3M in mere months.

In the past week, the coin’s value dropped by 31.03%, and over the last month, it declined by 39.02%. Despite these short-term decreases, WIF has shown resilience over the past six months, gaining 19.71%, which suggests potential for long-term growth. The technical indicators hint at possible future movements. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 28.61, indicating that the coin is currently oversold and might be poised for a rebound. The price is approaching a key support level at $1.91. If this support holds, WIF could bounce back toward the nearest resistance at $4.19, representing a substantial increase from current levels. Moving averages also provide insights into WIF’s trend. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.24, while the 100-day SMA is $2.62. A crossover could signal a shift in momentum. Additionally, the MACD level is at -0.0740, suggesting that bearish momentum may be waning. Traders are watching to see if WIF will rally or if it will test the second support level at $0.7749. Avalanche Avalanche (AVAX) has experienced notable price changes recently. In the past week, its price fell by 18.86%, marking a significant short-term decline. However, over the past month, AVAX gained 10.91%, indicating a positive trend. Looking at the last six months, the price increased by 43.24%, demonstrating substantial growth in the medium term. The current price ranges from $42.59 to $57.15. The nearest resistance level is $63.55, while the nearest support is at $34.42. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 27.18, suggesting that the token is oversold and may be due for a rebound. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $41.95, which is below the 100-day SMA of $47.35, hinting at potential upward movement. If AVAX breaks through the resistance at $63.55, it could target the next level at $78.12, representing a significant increase. Based on these indicators, AVAX may be set for a price rise. The oversold RSI and stochastic levels point to a possible upward correction. If the price holds above the support at $34.42 and gains momentum, it might reach higher resistance levels. The MACD level of -1.1796 also suggests potential for a trend reversal. Overall, the data points to growth potential for AVAX in the near future. Conclusion While WIF and AVAX show promise, XYZVerse’s unique sports-meme blend and ambitious 20,000% growth target position it as a standout in the current bull run.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE.

Table of Contents Plutus v3 and decentralized governance: Will the Cardano price make another rally? PropiChain: Bringing creativity to the $300 trillion real estate sector Why PropiChain Presale is a lucrative opportunity for investors As the Cardano price market performance continues to fluctuate, enthusiasts are keenly watching the developments around the asset, which, despite its recent struggles, has garnered optimism for 2025. Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, believes that the upcoming year could be transformative for ADA, especially as new competitors like PropiChain (PCHAIN) aim for astonishing growth in the coming year. You might also like: PropiChain’s crypto presale is changing real estate investment unlocking this $300T sector Plutus v3 and decentralized governance: Will the Cardano price make another rally? Cardano (ADA) continues demonstrating its commitment to creativity and decentralization with the recent launch of the Plutus v3 upgrade. This update significantly improves the blockchain’s smart contract capabilities, introducing more robust and efficient features that set ADA apart in the competitive blockchain space. The upgrade aligns seamlessly with the broader vision of complete decentralization, as governance now rests in the hands of ADA token holders. Introducing the Constitutional Committee as a temporary oversight body adds another layer of security, with plans to dissolve the committee once the governance framework is fully ratified. Despite these advancements, the Cardano price remains volatile. Trading at $1.093, the token has seen a modest 2.7% gain in recent days but remains within a tight price range. Yet, investor sentiment remains optimistic, with the Cardano price action scoring a strong 74 on the Fear & Greed Index. Over the past month, the Cardano price has gained 30%, highlighting its resilience amid market turbulence. PropiChain: Bringing creativity to the $300 trillion real estate sector While the Cardano price strategizes for a promising 2025, new entrants like PropiChain are making bold claims in the crypto space. PropiChain aims to change the real estate market by using blockchain technology to facilitate tokenized property investments. Built on a unique blockchain technology, the platform integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and the Metaverse to create a seamless ecosystem for buying, selling, and managing properties. PropiChain eliminates the need for complex paperwork, intermediaries, and geographical constraints by tokenizing real estate assets into NFTs, enabling investors to transact securely and efficiently. One of PropiChain’s standout features is its fractional ownership model, allowing users to buy and sell portions of high-value properties. This democratizes access to the lucrative real estate market, empowering individuals with limited capital to invest alongside institutional players. Moreover, AI plays a key role in the PropiChain ecosystem, providing AI-driven analytics to simplify property valuation, predict market trends, and automate transactions, ensuring that users make informed decisions with minimal effort. The platform’s integration with the Metaverse adds a layer to real estate exploration. Through virtual reality (VR), investors can tour properties from anywhere in the world, gaining a deeper understanding of their features without needing physical visits. The Propiverse feature expands opportunities for buyers and improves property marketing strategies for sellers. This reduces the time spent analyzing the market and travel costs. PropiChain also addresses the security challenge with its decentralized Title Contract system, which records all transactions on an immutable ledger. This approach eliminates risks such as fraud, corruption, and counterparty defaults, making real estate investments safer than ever. Additionally, smart contracts , audited by BlockAudit, automate leasing processes, rental payments, and lease renewals, reducing administrative burdens and enhancing transparency. Why PropiChain Presale is a lucrative opportunity for investors Listed on CoinMarketCap , PropiChain’s token presale is structured across multiple rounds, offering early participants the chance to acquire PCHAIN tokens at progressively increasing prices. In the current second round, the token is priced at $0.011 targeting a subsequent stage price surge to $0.023. Upon conclusion of the presale, the listing price is anticipated to be $0.032, providing early investors with substantial potential returns. For instance, an investment at the initial price point could yield an 800% return by the time of listing. Moreover, analysts have projected that PCHAIN could experience an over 120x increase, translating to significant gains for early adopters. Beyond the attractive pricing, PropiChain offers investors additional benefits, including property discounts, governance rights, and high annual percentage yields (APY) on holdings, with some estimates suggesting up to 225% APY. These incentives are designed to foster a robust community of stakeholders and drive the platform’s growth in the competitive crypto landscape. As investors brace for another Cardano price rally in 2025, platforms like PropiChain exemplify the unique applications of blockchain technology, extending beyond traditional financial instruments to encompass real-world assets. Investors seeking diversification and exposure to the growing field of real estate tokenization may find PropiChain’s presale an enticing opportunity, with the potential for significant returns as the platform matures and gains traction in the market.

37947119,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52819,1734833709,"Best Altcoins to Buy This Week: Why Qubetics, Litecoin, and VeChain Deserve Your Attention, Goatseus Maximus, Cat in a Dog’s World","Regarding altcoins, the crypto market always has choices. It’s like walking into a candy store, but you choose investments that could turn small bets into big wins instead of sweets. With the market constantly evolving, finding the best altcoins to buy this week can feel like hitting the jackpot. Fortunately, three contenders stand out: Qubetics , Litecoin (LTC), and VeChain (VET). Each has its own unique flavour—from innovation to reliability and beyond. Let’s dive in to see why these projects have captured the imagination of investors everywhere. Qubetics, a cutting-edge crypto platform making waves in the blockchain world, is at the centre of today’s buzz. But it’s not alone. Litecoin and VeChain have long been favourites in the crypto community for their dependability and innovative features . If you want to diversify your portfolio with promising altcoins, these three are worth a closer look. Qubetics: The New King of Innovation Qubetics is turning heads in the crypto space, and for good reason. Currently in its 13th presale stage, this rising star has sold over 365 million $TICS tokens to more than 11,100 holders. That’s over $7.4 million raised, with the token priced at an attractive $0.0342. What’s got analysts so excited? It’s the potential for exponential growth . Predictions suggest $TICS could skyrocket to $10 or even $15 after its mainnet launch, offering jaw-dropping ROI figures of 29,107% and 43,711%, respectively. Imagine dropping $40,000 on $TICS today—that could translate to a mind-boggling $11.6 million if it hits $10. Unreal, right? But Qubetics isn’t just about hyped numbers. It’s the tech that truly sets it apart. Enter QubeQode IDE, a revolutionary blockchain development tool that simplifies smart contract creation and blockchain development. Whether you’re a business, a developer, or just someone curious about blockchain, QubeQode IDE has something for everyone. Picture this: a small business wanting to create a loyalty programme could use QubeQode to roll out tokenised rewards without needing a tech team. Or think about freelancers securing payment contracts that execute automatically when work is delivered. From decentralised VPNs to cross-border payment solutions, Qubetics has all the ingredients to become a blockchain powerhouse. What makes this even sweeter? Analysts believe the project’s accessibility and innovation could attract widespread adoption, making it one of the best altcoins to buy this week. With its presale success and a clear roadmap for real-world utility, Qubetics isn’t just a gamble; it’s a calculated bet on the future of blockchain . Litecoin: The Digital Silver That Keeps Delivering If Bitcoin is gold, Litecoin is its reliable silver sibling. Created by Charlie Lee in 2011, Litecoin has carved out its niche as one of the most dependable cryptocurrencies on the market. LTC has been a favourite among investors looking for stability and growth potential for over a decade. With its faster transaction times and lower fees than Bitcoin, it’s no surprise that Litecoin has maintained a strong market presence. One of Litecoin’s standout features is its adoption in the payments space. Many merchants accept LTC as a form of payment, making it a practical choice for everyday transactions. Imagine buying a coffee or booking a flight with your Litecoin wallet. It’s that seamless. And let’s not forget its track record as a go-to investment for crypto enthusiasts who want an alternative to traditional stocks and bonds. Over the years, Litecoin’s price movements have mirrored the broader crypto market, making it an essential asset for those who want to ride the market’s highs while mitigating its lows. So, why is Litecoin still one of the best altcoins to buy this week? It’s all about staying power and innovation.

Why Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Buy in December 2024 for High-Yield Growth,"The crypto world never sleeps, and SUI has been making headlines lately as a blockchain project with big ambitions. Designed to bring unparalleled scalability and simplicity to decentralised applications, SUI has been the talk of the town among developers and investors alike. But as exciting as SUI’s prospects are, it’s still early days, leaving some potential investors wondering if it’s the right time to dive in. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), the project that’s rewriting the rules on blockchain innovation. While SUI focuses on boosting app efficiency, Qubetics is tackling a much bigger puzzle—bringing real-world assets onto the blockchain. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy in December 2024 with high-yield growth potential, Qubetics might just be the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. Qubetics ($TICS): The Best Crypto to Buy in December 2024 for Revolutionary Impact Let’s get straight to it: Qubetics is a game-changer. This isn’t just another crypto project—it’s the world’s first Web3 aggregator, and it’s solving one of the most practical problems in blockchain: how to bridge the gap between digital and real-world assets. Qubetics uses real-world asset tokenization to make blockchain technology useful, accessible, and valuable for everyone, from small businesses to everyday investors. Imagine you’re a business owner in Atlanta with inventory that’s worth thousands but is just sitting in a warehouse. With Qubetics, you can tokenize that inventory, turning it into blockchain-backed digital assets. Suddenly, you’ve got liquidity you can use for expansion, payroll, or new projects—all without dealing with banks or high-interest loans. It’s not just for businesses. Think about an artist in Brooklyn who wants to sell their work directly to collectors around the world. Tokenizing their art through Qubetics allows them to cut out the middlemen and keep every penny of their earnings. Or maybe you’re a property investor in Austin who wants to unlock equity without selling your asset. By tokenizing a portion of the property, you gain access to new income streams without losing ownership. Qubetics’ presale is already turning heads in the crypto world. Currently in Phase 13, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.034, and early adopters are piling in. Over $7.4 million has been raised so far, with more than 365 million tokens sold to over 11,100 holders. The price increases by 10% every week, with a 20% jump expected in the final presale phase. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 after the presale, offering a potential ROI of 900% for those who get in early. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy in December 2024, Qubetics isn’t just a contender—it’s leading the pack with its practical applications and enormous growth potential. SUI (SUI): A Rising Star with a Focus on Scalability SUI is one of those projects that gets people talking, and for good reason.

In 2024, SUI has been gaining traction, attracting attention from major players in the crypto world. Its unique object-centric data model allows for simplified programming and better efficiency, making it an appealing choice for developers. This innovation has sparked a wave of interest, with analysts predicting that SUI could play a major role in the next generation of blockchain networks. While SUI’s potential is undeniable, its ecosystem is still in the early stages of development. As a result, some investors may find it challenging to gauge its long-term growth trajectory. That said, its focus on scalability and developer-friendly tools makes it a project worth keeping an eye on, especially as adoption grows. For those seeking steady, long-term growth, SUI is a strong contender. However, if you’re after explosive returns and want to get in on a project at the ground floor, Qubetics offers an unparalleled opportunity. Don’t Miss Out on Qubetics Here’s the deal: crypto is a big tent, and there’s room for both Qubetics and SUI to shine. These two projects cater to different audiences and have distinct strengths, making them complementary additions to a diversified portfolio. SUI is a great choice for investors who believe in the future of decentralised applications and want to back a project with a solid technical foundation. Its focus on scalability and developer-friendliness ensures it will remain relevant as the blockchain ecosystem evolves. Qubetics, on the other hand, is all about creating real-world impact.

37946502,https://crypto.news/?p=14321363,1734833484,Dogecoin and Solana are bearish while this exchange token soars with 500% gains,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. DTX Exchange surges 500% in presale, attracting investors amid bearish trends for DOGE and SOL; a 900% rise predicted. Table of Contents DTX Exchange price rises 500%, more gains anticipated CEO: The Dogecoin price aligns with its typical movement The price of Solana may hit $1,000, analyst predicts What may lie ahead for DTX Exchange, Dogecoin & Solana? The crypto market is now experiencing a bearish trend, with many tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) showing red price charts. Although market analysts like CEO and CryptoELITES remain bullish about them, many investors are now turning to a new exchange token. This is DTX Exchange (DTX) , a phase six presale star that has seen its value increase by 500% so far. As it may redefine online trading, experts hint that this altcoin could rise by another 900% in 2025. You might also like: Last chance to get DTX Exchange before it soars, set to follow ETH, XRP DTX Exchange price rises 500%, more gains anticipated As Dogecoin and Solana appear to be in the red, DTX Exchange is making headlines with its presale performance. This phase six presale sensation has made early buyers 500% richer while raising over $10M. With over 300K wallets already having DTX, it is clear interest in this altcoin is high. By holding this altcoin, people will get: Governance voting rights: The ability to vote on future developments for the DTX Exchange platform. Passive income: A percentage of the trading fee revenue generated on DTX Exchange. Staking rewards: Earn up to 15% APY in staking rewards. DTX will also power the DTX Exchange , an upcoming hybrid trading platform that lets users trade over 120K asset classes at up to 1000x leverage. These assets will include gold, stocks, crypto currencies, etc. Recently, CoinMarketCap listed the DTX token, which will allow millions of traders to set their eyes on it. As demand rises, so will its price. Currently, one DTX costs just $0.12, a 500% rise from its starting price of $0.02. However, a Tier-1 CEX listing is projected to push this value to $0.20 – a 66% rise from its current price. This could make DTX one of the top altcoins for fast returns. CEO: The Dogecoin price aligns with its typical movement Although Dogecoin is one of the meme coin titans, its value has dropped recently. CoinMarketCap shows that the Dogecoin price fell over 20% in the past 30 days. During that time, its value moved between around $0.40 and nearly $0.30. Crypto analyst CEO thinks this movement aligns with this meme coin’s typical 3-4 year cycle. According to his X post, Dogecoin may soar past $1 after a reversal comes soon. However, the Dogecoin market cap still sits at around $45B, which could hinder its growth. This meme coin will need a lot of new money for its price to see noteworthy gains. Crypto currencies like DTX Exchange will not have this problem, meaning fast returns for investors. The price of Solana may hit $1,000, analyst predicts Solana is among the top 10 altcoins at the moment. However, it has seen some red price charts recently as a bearish trend is gripping the entire crypto market. On the one-month chart, the Solana price has dropped over 20%—from around $240 to nearly $180. But, market expert CryptoELITES remains optimistic about Solana. In a recent X post, he told his followers that this altcoin will soar to $1,000 in the upcoming massive bull market. This Solana price prediction has given many traders faith in its growth. Although the Solana crypto may rebound soon, investors are also considering the DTX Exchange’s advantages. For instance, the Solana blockchain has around 65K TPS, while the DTX blockchain boasts over 100K TPS. This could make DTX a favorite over SOL. What may lie ahead for DTX Exchange, Dogecoin & Solana? While Dogecoin and Solana could rebound again as they have strong community backing, experts are also bullish about DTX Exchange. They claim its fair-launch model, ties to the $18T gold market, and small market cap could give it faster gains and more stability. Therefore, experts think this altcoin may soar by 900% in 2025.

37946149,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631730,1734832359,"Hyperliquid breaks records, what’s behind the $11.5B surge?","Hyperliquid has reached a milestone with $11.5 billion in trading volume and $1.32 billion in liquidation volume. This surge is by a massive airdrop of 310 million HYPE tokens, increasing liquidity and interest. Despite the success, risks such as price instability and liquidity challenges remain. The platform’s unique Dutch auction system adds both excitement and uncertainty. Hyperliquid, has achieved a milestone by reaching a $11.5 billion trading volume and liquidation volume reaching $1.32 billion, as well as setting new all-time highs. This surge is not only a reflection of Hyperliquid’s growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. So, what is behind this explosive growth, and what are the challenges that come with it? Reason behind the Hyperliquid surge The huge increase in trading volume for Hyperliquid is mainly due to its massive airdrop. The platform gave away 310 million HYPE tokens to over 94,000 users. HYPE, played a major role in this surge, quickly rebounding after a market dip and surpassing $33 to set a new historical peak with the assistance fund currently holding around 11.234 million HYPE tokens, which is worth approximately $356 million. The platform’s assets are worth over $1 billion, and tokens like HYPE have even reached over $33, attracting a lot of attention. As more people have started holding and trading the tokens, the platform has seen a huge rise in liquidity and trading volume. Within days, 270 million HYPE tokens were claimed, worth around 11.5 billion, which surrpassed Uniswap’s 2020 airdrop in size. Some people think the price might drop later as the excitement fades, and Hyperliquid still relies on its own DEX trading to keep prices stable. Tokens like PURR and HFUN have seen huge gains, with some rising by 200%, which makes the platform even more attractive. Hyperliquid stands out from other decentralized exchanges with its unique trading system and low fees. It has $2.62 billion in locked value and a fee model that supports buybacks and ecosystem growth. The platform’s token supply is limited to 270.9 million out of a possible 1 billion, creating scarcity and demand. While Bitcoin and other altcoins saw price drops, HYPE’s price increased. Hyperliquid uses a Dutch auction system, where token prices drop until a buyer is found, thus driving up the token’s value quickly by limiting the number of tokens and using this auction model. Hyperliquid avoids flooding the market with too many low-value tokens, keeping them more exclusive. Auctions for tokens like GOD and HFUN have shown how quickly they can generate high demand. Hyperliquid’s high liquidity, especially for HYPE and other tokens, has been key to its record trading volume. As more tokens are added to the platform, liquidity keeps improving, which is attracting more traders. The liquidity to the market cap ratio of HYPE is 4.8%, which increases trading activity as more assets could join the platform. The other side Even though Hyperliquid has been successful, its approach comes with risks. The limited number of tokens and auctions help prevent oversaturation but can also make prices unstable. New tokens often lack liquidity or market makers, which can cause their prices to freeze. However, as more liquidity comes in, some tokens might suddenly spike in price. The airdrop-driven surge in users could lead to price instability. Once the initial excitement dies down, many users may sell their tokens, causing price drops and volatility. The Dutch auction system also creates unpredictable price discovery. It can lead to overvaluation of tokens, which may experience sharp declines once market sentiment shifts. As more tokens enter the ecosystem, many may lack the liquidity or stability to maintain long-term value, especially as the regulatory landscape for DeFi platforms becomes more uncertain. The increasing cost to secure a ticker, which can reach nearly $1 million, makes it hard for smaller projects to join. This also helps keep out low-value tokens. While this system helps feature valuable tokens, it can also leave some tokens without enough trading activity for a long time, making it risky to trade on the platform. The long-term effects of this approach remain uncertain for now.

The crypto analyst alluded to historical data to show how high DOGE could go in this bull cycle. How High Dogecoin Price Could Go In This Market Cycle In an X post, Dima James shared a chart that showed that the Dogecoin price could reach as high as $80 in this market cycle. The analyst also predicted that the cycle top for Dogecoin could happen sometime between February 11th and May 7th, 2025. The analyst alluded to historical data to explain why he is confident that Dogecoin could reach this target. Related Reading: XRP Price Crash: Analyst Says Don’t Get Distracted As RSI Is Still Above A Bullish 50% Analyzing the daily chart, the crypto analyst explained that year 4 is typically the final year of each cycle, which is when the Dogecoin price has peaked every single time. He highlighted an indicator on the chart that has accurately predicted every single Bitcoin top. The analyst noted that Dogecoin tends to peak three to four weeks after Bitcoin reaches its top. In line with this, the analyst predicts that the cycle top for Dogecoin will happen sometime between February 11th and May 7th. Meanwhile, discussing the four-year cycle more, Dima James noted that the Dogecoin price had an impressive performance in this cycle’s year 3 (2024) compared to the year 3s of the previous cycles (2016 and 2020). He further reaffirmed his prediction that the Dogecoin price will finish this year at $0.31, marking the meme coin’s best year 3 performance to date. Year 4 has historically been the most significant year for Dogecoin, and Dima James expects a similar or even greater result in 2025, with Dogecoin outperforming its previous year 4 cycle performances. The analyst believes this will happen due to increased adoption and technological advancements. DOGE Has Found A Local Bottom In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade mentioned that the Dogecoin price may have found a local bottom. The analyst explained that there is a Doji Dragonfly hitting the Fibonacci level of 0.618 on the daily chart. He further noted that DOGE showing price rejection at this level indicates a potential bottom found.

The crypto analyst added that the Dogecoin price has halted its downtrend at the channel’s mid-band, highlighting the Gaussian Channel’s supportive nature. In line with this, Trader Tardigrade suggested that Dogecoin is ready for a bullish reversal.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD surging by $7,000 in under 24 hours. After dipping near December lows of $92,000 and liquidating leveraged long positions, Bitcoin rallied as the weekend began. It reached $99,500 on Bitstamp, with bulls pushing for six-figure territory despite the absence of institutional trading activity. Coinbase saw a resurgence of buying pressure, reversing earlier sell-side activity. “Coinbase buying a lot since lows,” noted trader Exitpump on X, contrasting the buying volumes on Coinbase with those on Binance. Another trader, Superbro, highlighted that Bitcoin’s 50-day simple moving average (SMA) acted as a robust support level. On shorter timeframes, Superbro observed a potential breakout pattern forming in the shape of an inverse head and shoulders, a bullish indicator for both short- and long-term trends. Meanwhile, trading account Doctor Magic drew attention to Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI), describing recent movements as a potential “scam” breakdown. “There is a reason I am obsessed about this RSI scam breakdown that I have been posting for a while now; it happened in every major leg up until the first local top,” he explained, referencing past price correlations. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s daily RSI stood at 52, maintaining its position above the critical midpoint of 50.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW.

VIRTUAL is trading for $2.74 at time of writing, a nearly 20% gain on the day. On December 16th, it peaked at $3.34 while a year ago, it was moving for around $0.013. Moving on to the top crypto asset by market cap, Santiment says that Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) latest drop to under $100,000 has caused a “buy the dip” mentality among investors. “With Bitcoin falling as low as $95,500 today, the ratio of crypto discussions that are about buying crypto’s dip has reached its highest level in over eight months. The last time we saw the crowd nearly this enthusiastic about dip buying was the major crash on August 4th. Since that time, Bitcoin’s market cap is +81% higher.” Source: Santiment/X Bitcoin is trading for $97,006 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.

Some feared that wallets may have been breached, as hackers always target crypto wallets. Responding to the X post , some users highlighted that the problem was beyond balances, as buying and selling nodes had issues. However, some were relieved and grateful for the reassurance of their funds and their efforts to restore the wallet’s operations. Crypto hackers stole up to $2.2 billion in 2024 Although the Trust Wallet issue was merely a glitch, it caused widespread panic among community members, who feared their wallets had been drained. Their concerns were valid, given the high frequency of security breaches in the crypto space. Chainalysis reports that crypto thieves stole a staggering $2.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2024. Most of the crypto losses in 2024 resulted from hacking associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). A Chainalysis report reveals that North Korean hackers, including the lethal Lazarus, account for 61% of all the crypto stolen this year. Although Decentralized Finance was the most affected by hackers in the earlier months of 2024, centralized finance had the most significant financial blows in the year’s second and third quarters. The DMM Bitcoin suffered a $305 million loss in May from hackers, and in July, WazirX lost $234.9 Million. The team resolved the glitch and resumed normal operations Through their X account, Trust Wallet stated that they successfully resolved the glitch and that the wallet is fully operational. Some users confirmed, saying that they can access their balances. Trust wallet is one of the many digital wallets that crypto users rely on. It has always boasted of its robust safety measures and easy-to-navigate features. The glitch, if otherwise, would have been the biggest test for the digital wallet. Crypto security risks may increase over time, requiring users to be alert. Artificial intelligence might further complicate the situation. Most hackers are beginning to use AI for sophisticated attacks, including phishing, deepfakes, and malware.

If you’re looking to capitalise on this fast-growing trend, this month is brimming with potential. Leading the way are BTFD Coin, FLOKI, and BONE. Each of these coins brings something unique to the table, making them the best new meme coins to buy this month. While BTFD Coin is making waves with its blockbuster presale and historic Stage 7 rollback, FLOKI is growing as a decentralised powerhouse, and BONE is carving its niche within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Let’s explore why these three are dominating conversations this month. BTFD Coin: The Bull Market’s Next Big Winner BTFD Coin has taken the crypto world by storm, raising over $4.2 million in its presale. With 57 billion coins sold and more than 6,100 holders onboard, the project’s momentum is undeniable. Now in its 12th stage, BTFD Coin is catching the attention of savvy investors looking to capitalise on its growth potential. What’s driving the hype? Its festive Stage 7 price rollback. For a limited time, buyers can grab BTFD Coin at $0.000064—a steep 50.77% discount from its current Stage 12 price of $0.00013, using the bonus code “BIG50”. This isn’t just a discount; it’s an opportunity to channel the spirit of the legendary 1973 financial crash, where smart investors like Warren Buffett turned chaos into wealth by buying undervalued assets. Here’s why this rollback matters: BTFD Coin is set to list at $0.0006 after the presale ends, promising an ROI of 837.5%. Imagine investing $15,000 at the discounted Stage 7 price. You’d secure 234,375,000 tokens. When the price hits $0.0006, your investment could soar to $140,625. That’s the power of buying the dip at the right time. Beyond its presale success, BTFD Coin offers tangible utility with its Play2Earn gaming platform and staking rewards boasting a 90% APY. Its community-driven ethos ensures that it’s more than just another meme coin—it’s a movement. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to buy this month, BTFD Coin’s mix of presale momentum and strategic pricing makes it an unmissable opportunity.

This rollback ends on January 5, 2025—don’t miss your chance to buy the dip! FLOKI: The Viking-Inspired Meme Coin Named after Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, FLOKI has carved its place in the crypto world by combining meme culture with real-world utility.

The coin has a loyal following of “Floki Vikings” who are passionate about spreading its vision. With its ecosystem continuing to expand, FLOKI offers an intriguing mix of entertainment and financial opportunity. BONE: The Heart of Shiba Inu’s Ecosystem BONE is the governance token for ShibaSwap, the decentralised exchange powering the Shiba Inu ecosystem.

For those looking for a meme coin with real-world use cases and strong community backing, BONE is a top contender.

37942651,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666183,1734825659,SUI Shows Strong Bullish Comeback: Breakout Above $4.98 In Sight,"SUI has shown a remarkable bullish comeback, overcoming earlier setbacks with impressive strength. The cryptocurrency has steadily gained ground, attracting attention. As the price approaches the critical $4.98 resistance, the potential for a breakout looms. A successful move above this level could trigger a new phase of bullish momentum, setting the stage for the token to achieve new highs. Specifically, the $4.98 has been a key barrier in recent trading, and breaking through it would be a significant achievement for SUI. With strong market sentiment building, a breakthrough may inspire more buying pressure, pushing the price even higher. As the asset moves close to this crucial level, the possibility of new record highs becomes increasingly likely, making SUI one of the critical cryptocurrencies to watch in the coming days. SUI Bulls Take Charge Toward $4.98 Threshold SUI is currently demonstrating impressive bullish momentum as its price steadily climbs toward the critical $4.98 resistance level. This price action signals a strong comeback for the token, with bulls steadily regaining control after previous bearish pressure. The $4.98 threshold has emerged as a key point of interest since it represents a potential breakout zone that could drive the price higher toward new highs. Related Reading: SUI The Rising Star: Analyst Foresees Over $25 Breakthrough A successful breach above the $4.98 level would confirm the continuation of the positive trend and attract additional buying interest. This could lead to a shift in market sentiment, with buyers asserting dominance and possibly pushing the price toward the next resistance levels. A Break Above $4.98 Could Signal More Upside SUI’s price has successfully risen above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a significant technical milestone that signals a shift in market sentiment. Significantly, this rise above the 100-day SMA indicates that the token may be entering a new bullish phase, as the price action is now trading above a key moving average that has historically acted as support or resistance. It reflects a growing market optimism and signs of stability, raising the potential for a continued upward trend. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) confirms strong upbeat strength for SUI, rising above the 50% threshold to 59%. This suggests that buying pressure is outpacing selling, signaling a shift in the market and a reversal of the recent downtrend. With the RSI in a neutral-to-bullish zone, there is room for further upside if the momentum continues, supporting the case for continued price gains and a break above $4.98. Related Reading: SUI Hits New ATH, Can Bullish Momentum Lead Price To $5 This Weekend? In conclusion, if SUI’s price breaks above the $4.98 level, it could lead to the formation of new highs, implying a strong continuation of the uptrend. However, failure to breach this resistance may result in a consolidation phase or a pullback, suggesting that sellers could still have control over the market and limiting upside potential.
