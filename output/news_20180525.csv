42380717,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zCE7,1527285548,ZeppelinOS Software Launch Promises Easier Fix for Ethereum Contracts,"Unfixable ethereum smart contract errors might soon be a thing of the past.  While such bugs can cause any number of issues for blockchain operators today, a startup called Zeppelin Solutions is launching ZeppelinOS, a release that marks the fruition of a vision its team of veteran smart contracts developers has had since 2016, they announced Friday.  Launching on the ethereum blockchain today, ZeppelinOS seeks to develop a series of libraries for smart contract applications and tools on the ethereum network.  Notably, the platform aims to use a custom cryptocurrency to incentivize developers to continuously improve and build upon its existing code, creating a standardized system for individuals to develop, manage and operate these applications, said chief executive Demian Brener.  In materials provided to CoinDesk, the startup noted that it believes ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" have been put at risk because of vulnerabilities in smart contracts that could have been fixed, but weren't because the costs were too excessive.  As such, the company hopes to rectify this issue by providing its ZEP tokens to developers who propose fixes and upgrades to a library, while other users who hold tokens can support different proposals.  Though the mainnet launched Friday, a number of companies already began testing or have plans to begin testing the platform These include notable startups Protocol, Storj, TrueBit and OB1.  OpenBazaar chief executive Brian Hoffman told CoinDesk that his company is interested in the platform, though it hasn't yet begun to use it officially.  He said:  ""They've proven to be an industry leading smart contract auditor and security focused organization and we hope to leverage their expertise and ZeppelinOS for future work on the OpenBazaar token.""

Announced Friday, Beverly Hills real estate brokerage Hilton & Hyland is partnering with blockchain startup Propy to auction the Palazzetto inside the Palazzo Albertoni Spinola, a mansion built between 1580 and 1616.  The Unesco heritage site was designed by architect Giacomo Della Porta in the early 1600s, and is currently valued at $42 million. Interested parties can bid on it in either fiat or cryptocurrencies until June 28, said Propy CEO Natalia Karayaneva.  Karayaneva told CoinDesk that she believes the auction is a unique opportunity to record the sale of a historic building on a blockchain, one made more notable in light of the fact that real estate applications of blockchain are still in early stages.  She added:  ""It is not a transfer test of a couple dollars worth of value, or questionable digital collectibles — but a multi-million dollar deal where lack of transparency can result in a significantly worse deal for the investor or seller.""  Going forward, she hopes to see more real estate deals registered on blockchains, noting that the security and the immutable record behind the technology can reassure buyers that they are not risking their funds. She also believes that blockchain technology can make the process of purchasing buildings more efficient by automating property transactions, which would decrease fees and giving homeowners a way to prove their property rights.  ""The process of buying real estate today is non-transparent and non-secure even in the U.S. The bidding mechanism of providing offers blindly is very manipulative. This is why it is important to not only automate payment and title deed recordings ... but also to automate the auction and offering mechanisms,"" Karayaneva said.

42380714,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zC7p,1527266747,BitGo Is Building Its Own Digital Asset Custodian,"Four months after announcing it would acquire the asset custodian Kingdom Trust, blockchain security firm BitGo has decided instead it would just build its own.  The startup said Thursday that it was ""seeking a charter to build BitGo Trust,"" a ""new, regulated, qualified custodian"" that will be built specifically for digital assets, according to a Medium post. At the same time, it announced it would no longer proceed with acquiring Kingdom Trust, after approval of the acquisition spent four months in regulatory limbo.  This limbo, however, is not what inspired BitGo to build its own trust, marketing vice president Clarissa Horowitz told CoinDesk. Rather, the startup came to the decision after looking at its clients' needs, she said, adding:  ""We spent a lot of time over the course of this working with customers because ultimately that's who we're going to be serving and we realized they would be best served by a custodian who was entirely focused on their assets, so our focus has been to create a fully qualified independent digital custodian.""  While BitGo does not yet know what sort of timeline it is looking at, Horowitz did say that the company is ""working very closely with regulators."" In the meantime, it already offers customers two options for asset management. The first option revolves around BitGo's recently-announced suite of custodial services, where the company now offers several degrees of custodial services.  Alternatively, clients can manage their own assets, she said.  On the importance of building a digital asset custodian specifically aimed at the cryptocurrency space, Horowitz said ""I think it's critical, I think the way that you hold digital assets [is different from how you're] holding stock certificates.""  She referred to comments made by BitGo chief executive Mike Belshe, who said in a previous post that ""custodians make institutional investing possible by providing a level of checks and balances to keep money safe.""

Bella's Kitty Den, a marketplace for CryptoKitties, launched a charitable initiative - Kitties for a Cause - in April 2018 to raise funds for the Seattle Children's Hospital, according to a medium post. The effort raised 21.6 ether tokens, or more than $15,000 at the time, in under three weeks, CryptoKitties told CoinDesk. At present prices, the 21.6 ethers would be worth closer to $13,000.  Users were able to bid on 370 different CryptoKitties donated to Bella's Kitty Den, said Axiom Zen spokesperson Yasmine Nadery. Axiom Zen is CryptoKitties' parent company, and helped the charity raise awareness with posts on its official Medium page.  Nadery told CoinDesk that the event ended on April 15, though it was originally scheduled to run through the entire month. In addition to the ethereum raised, $180 were donated to the hospital directly through the campaign.  She noted that Bella, the 10-year-old who, along with her father, runs BKD, originally began the campaign as a way ""to do good"" with the kitties she owned. She added:  ""This event was created by a CryptoKitties community member, and we were in awe of the initiative this young girl took. When she and her father told us about it, we jumped at the opportunity to partner with them partner with them and our community creators to spread the word about Bella's cause.""

42380727,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zCQh,1527261340,Just One Top Crypto Bucked This Week's Market Downturn,"Shadowing the losses in bitcoin, the top-25 cryptocurrencies have all fallen over the last seven days – all bar one, that is.  The broader markets seem to have been dragged lower by a 9.5 percent week-on-week drop in bitcoin (BTC), the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap. BTC fell below $8,000 on May 22 for the first time since April 18 and hit a low of $7,272 yesterday, as per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Other major names like ethereum (ETH) and bitcoin cash (BCH) are reporting 14 percent weekly declines in price. EOS, meanwhile, is down 6 percent and XRP has shed 8.5 percent over the same period. The sole top-25 cryptocurrency to be up this week is TRON (TRX), which is reporting minor gains, possibly on the back of positive news flow.  The cryptocurrency markets could remain on the defensive next week too, as the odds are stacked in favor of a drop in bitcoin prices to below $7,000.  Further, the ethereum-bitcoin exchange rate (ETH/BTC) has rolled over in favor of the bears, having breached a key ascending trendline earlier this month. The ETH/BTC pair is widely considered an advance indicator for alternative cryptocurrencies, as many of them are built based on the ethereum blockchain. So, alternative cryptocurrencies may drop sharply if BTC extends the decline.  Looking more widely, the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies dropped to $322.5 billion on May 24 – the lowest level since April 16, according to CoinMarketCap. At time of writing, the total market value stands at $336 billion – down 14 percent week-on-week.  Weekly gainer  TRON  Weekly performance: +1.83 percent  All-time high: $0.30  Closing price on May 18: $0.0693  Current market price: $0.070  Rank as per market capitalization: 9  TRON (TRX) is reporting moderate gains amid the broader market sell-off, possibly due to growing investor interest in the mainnet launch, scheduled for May 31.  The project also announced a partnership with vSport to develop a FIFA World Cup prediction platform that may have helped TRX score gains. However, the cryptocurrency may rank high on the list of top losers next week, the technical charts suggest.  Daily chart  A bear flag breakdown would signal a continuation of the sell-off from the April 30 high of $0.10 and open the doors for a drop to $0.05 (rising trendline support). TRX bulls would need to defend that level at all cost, as a violation there would mean a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  Weekly top losers  ICON  Weekly performance: -25.89 percent  All-time high: $12.04  Closing price on May 18: $3.63  Current market price: $2.69  Rank as per market capitalization: 23  ICON (ICX) has taken a beating, having failed to capitalize on the bullish breakout seen at the end of April. The blockchain project created backed by South Korean developers entered into a partnership with LINE – Japan's largest messaging app – earlier this month. Still, ICX nosedived 25.89 percent over the last seven days and could decline further, the technical charts indicate.  Daily chart  The 5-day and 10-day MAs are sloping downwards in favor of the bears. Acceptance below the long-term descending trendline would allow re-test of $1.82 (April lows). Only a daily close above the 10-day MA, currently seen at $3.26 would abort the bearish view.  Bytecoin  Weekly performance: -25 percent  All-time high: $ 0.030134  Closing price on May 18: $0.009194  Current market price: $0.00689  Rank as per market capitalization: 19  Having breached the key rising trendline on April 18, bytecoin (BCN) fell to $0.0065 on May 24 – the lowest level since May 8. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.0069 on HitBTC. Prices had surged in the first half of May after the cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced its listing on the exchange on May 7.  Daily chart  The prospects of a further slide towards $0.0048 are high, as indicated by the downside break of the ascending trendline and the downward sloping 5-day and 10-day MAs. The RSI also dipped below 50.00 this week, confirming a bearish reversal.  A daily close above the 10-day MA, currently seen at $0.0085, would abort the bearish view. Meanwhile, a move above $0.010 would put the bulls back in the driving seat.  Zcash  Weekly performance: -20.34 percent  All-time high: $953.34  Closing price on May 18: $358.81  Current market price: $285.85  Rank as per market capitalization: 21  Zcash (ZEC) turned in a poor performance this week, possibly due to profit-taking after the previous week's 50 percent rally. Total trading volume has dropped 63 percent week-on-week, according to CoinMarketCap, which indicates the 20 percent decline is likely a healthy pullback.  That said, the tide seems to have turned in favor of the bears at least for the short-term, the technical charts indicate.  Daily chart  The bear cross of the 5-day and 10-day MAs and the bearish RSI (below 50.00) show scope for a drop to ascending trendline support, currently seen at $254.  A daily close below that level would mean the rally from the April 7 low of $173 has ended and could yield a deeper sell-off to $228 (May 12 low).

42380723,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zCLf,1527258648,Chinese Blockchain Complex Offers Startups Millions in Subsidies,"A newly established blockchain industrial park in the Chinese city of Hangzhou is hoping to attract talented individuals and startups by offering millions of dollars-worth of subsidies.  A policy guide announcing the incentives was published on Thursday via the official WeChat account of the Xiong'An Fund (which translates as ""Grand Shores Fund"") – the primary operator of the blockchain complex, both of which were launched in April.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the establishment of the $1 billion blockchain fund and the dedicated blockchain incubation park were notable both for the amount involved and because the Hangzhou city government backed the initiative with 30 percent of the total funding.  According to the new policy, though still subject to further revisions, the industrial park plans to offer a maximum of 3 million yuan (roughly $490,000) as a resettlement allowance to qualifying individuals with high-level blockchain-based skills.  In addition, four main categories of subsidies are being made available for blockchain-related startups in a bid to attract them to set up shop at the complex.  For instance, for early stage startups, the industrial park plans to provide each with a maximum of $230,000 for housing and $1 million as research and development funding. More mature blockchain startups may apply to reside in the area with the help of $480,000 for housing and $780,000 for R&D.

The adult movie actress, who became famous for her claim to have had an affair with U.S. President Donald Trump in 2006 and a resulting legal battle, has partnered with Vice Industry Token (VIT) for the move, according to an announcement released Friday.  VIT, which was created for use cases within the adult entertainment industry, is being rolled out across StormyDaniels.com to reward site visitors for watching videos. Tokens earned can then be used to access premium content or to purchase services at other sites supporting the token.  Darkreach Communications, the firm managing Daniels' site, will also be rolling out VIT incentives across its other 20-plus other adult websites, according to the announcement.  Calling the move to add cryptocurrency a ""no brainer,"" Darkreach president Rob Murray said:  ""With VIT, everyone is going to make money – from the users on my sites, to myself and the performers. The way the VIT blockchain works, we all get a piece of the token, and the guaranteed genuine data is the icing in the cake.""  The news comes as the case for cryptocurrency grows increasingly popular in the adult industry – a space in which anonymity of users is much in demand.

Announced Thursday, the Shenzhen National Taxation Bureau and Tencent have jointly set up an ""Intelligent Tax"" innovation lab, that aims to promote technological innovation around taxation processes.  The lab will combine theoretical research with nascent technologies, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and Big Data, for taxation management and electronic invoice applications, a release states.  Shenzhen reportedly has a sizable underground economy, with, for example, peddlers openly hawking bogus receipts, according to The New York Times. Buyers use the the fake paperwork to evade taxes and defraud employers, and detecting forged or doctored receipts is a challenge for tax collectors, small businesses and China's state-run enterprises.  According to Ma Huateng, Tencent's CEO and chairman of the board, the Intelligent Tax lab is already working on a new digital invoice based on blockchain technology – a legally valid digital receipt that serves as proof of purchase for goods and services. The blockchain-based solution will be the first product incubated at the lab, he added.  The product will be based on Tencent's blockchain platform, which was announced in April, and is the nation's first research into the application of blockchain for invoicing, the release claims.  Li Wei, deputy director of the Shenzhen Municipal Bureau of State Taxation, said that the key features of the digital invoice include complete traceability and data security that will help to effectively combat fake invoices and ""improve the invoice supervision process.""

42401582,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd05nw,1527242442,Bitcoin Faces Close Below Long-Term Support In First Since 2015,"Bitcoin risks closing below the 50-week moving average (MA) – an important long-term support not breached for over two-and-a-half years.  With the bears already on the offensive following the recent sell-off, prices are likely to suffer if bitcoin closes on Sunday below the key support, currently seen at $7,611. More worryingly for the bulls, since the cryptocurrency has not traded below the 50-week MA since October 2015, acceptance below that level would only add credence to the argument that the long-term bull run has ended.  As of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,449 on Bitfinex, having dropped below the 50-week MA on May 23.  Weekly chart (2015–2018)  As seen on the chart above, the long-term moving average had acted as a strong support in the first quarter. BTC found strong bids in mid April following the repeated failure (marked by a circle) on the part of the bears to penetrate the 50-week MA.  Subsequently, the rally from the 50-week MA to $9,990 (May 5 high) reinforced the moving average as a strong long-term support. Hence, a downside break would raise the odds of a slide to fresh 2017 lows below $6,000.  Looking ahead, price chart analysis suggests that bitcoin is likely to end the week below the key $7,611 level.  To start with, the weekly relative strength index (RSI) is below 50.00 (in the bearish territory) and trending south in favor of the bears. The RSI has also found acceptance below the key support zone of 53.55–55.00, which only strengthens the bear case.  Meanwhile, the daily chart below also shows scope for a drop below $7,000.  Daily chart  The bears currently have the upper hand, as indicated by the lower highs and lower lows pattern, downside break of the channel, downward sloping (bearish) 5-day and 10-day MAs.  The RSI is holding below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), but well above 30.00 (oversold region), indicating room for sell-off to $6,870 (triangle support).  Hourly chart  Despite the bullish price RSI divergence on the hourly chart, BTC failed to cross the falling trendline hurdle, underscoring the strong bearish sentiment in the market.  View  BTC looks set to close below the 50-week MA (at $7,611) for the first time since October 2015, signaling a major bearish breakdown and opening the doors for a re-test of $6,000 (2018 low).  A corrective rally may save the day for the bulls, however, the probability of a bearish weekly close below the 50-week MA will remain high as long as bitcoin is trading below $8,644 (May 21 high).

42401576,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd05i2,1527238830,Alabama Securities Watchdog Hits 3 ICOs with Cease-and-Desists,"The Alabama Securities Commission (ASC), the U.S. state's securities regulator, has joined its counterparts in Texas and New Jersey in taking action on initial coin offerings (ICOs) that are soliciting local residents.  According to a cease-and-desist order entered on May 2 and revealed yesterday, the agency has ordered purported cryptocurrency mining firm Extrabit to cease its token sale offering in the state.  The ASC alleged the firm has been illegally soliciting Alabama investors with what it considers an unregistered securities offering after it advertised its token sale on the website of WSFA, an NBC-affiliated TV station licensed in the state capital, Montgomery.  While currently the online ad appears to have been taken down, the agency said in the order that the firm originally claimed that investors in the pre-ICO phase could purchase Extrabit's token ""EXB"" at half price.  ""To participate in the pre-sale, the user must invest $20,000 and after the purchase, the tokens will be sent to MyEtherWallet within 48 hours,"" the agency quoted the original ad as saying.  Further, Extrabit's white paper claims that, since the firm generates its profits mainly from mining bitcoin, zcash and monero, it promises a 185 percent return on investment every quarter for investors who maintain a positive balance in their EXB wallet.  As well as offering unregistered securities, the ASC said the project made ""materially misleading"" statements to defraud or deceive investors.  And Extrabit seems not to be the only token project that is targeting residents in Alabama. A Google search for ""token sale"" on the WSFA website currently comes up with over 200 press release-style ads from various ICO projects.  Furthermore, the ASC has also tackled two other token sale projects, named LEV and Platinum, with cease-and-desist orders entered on May 2 and May 18, respectively.  Like with Extrabit, the agency accused the two projects of selling unregistered securities in Alabama while making unrealistic promises to potential investors over the likely returns on investment.  The ASC actions also follow its counterparts in other U.S. states such as Texas and New Jersey that have recently stepped up their efforts in scrutinizing and red-lighting cryptocurrency projects that are soliciting investments locally.

Indeed, The Wall Street Journal recently found that 271 of 1,450 ICOs it analyzed displayed ""red flags that include plagiarized investor documents, promises of guaranteed returns and missing or fake executive teams.""  Still, with regular Joes turning into crypto millionaires, however infrequently, they're enticing bets for investors.  Expanding on the WSJ's analysis, CoinDesk wanted to make it clear what kind of approaches fraudulent ICOs take, and there may be no better poster-child than Pink Taxi Coin and its PTT crypto token, recently promoted on Twitter by John McAfee, an entrepreneur who made his name selling software but has recently pivoted to crypto.  A McAfee endorsement has no doubt become a worrisome sign for token investors, but there's much more to Pink Taxi Coin than just a bad endorsement.  Paul Walsh, CEO of MetaCert, which recently launched a browser extension to warn users when they visit a cryptocurrency phishing or scam site, told CoinDesk:  ""There are certainly enough red flags surrounding this ICO warranting a warning to potential investors, starting with the reports of plagiarism.""  Copy, paste  CoinDesk first heard about Pink Taxi Coin from Lithuania-based ride-hailing app A2B Taxi (which has an ICO underway).  According to the A2B Taxi spokesperson, Pink Taxi Coin had plagiarized basically everything from A2B Taxi – ""website design, content materials, texts, even our advisor's video explaining our token model.""  Sure enough, when CoinDesk visited Pink Taxi Coin's original website (archived version) – aside from the name change and a shift from a green theme to a pink one – the entire page was seemingly copied and pasted from A2B Taxi's site. The text, formatting and much of the artwork were identical.  The Pink Taxi white paper (archived version), from disclaimer to the appendix, was also identical to A2B Taxi's, though excessive use of a thesaurus had made that difficult to demonstrate through a simple control-F search. For example, the statement ""the payments on A2B Taxi app will be completed using cryptocurrency"" had been modified within the Pink Taxi Coin white paper to ""the payments on PINK Taxi application will be finished utilizing cryptocurrency.""  On the whole, these changes made the paper difficult to parse, if not completely meaningless.  ""I would not tell that plagiarism is something unseen or new to the ICO market,"" A2B Taxi's blockchain advisor Vytautas Kaseta told CoinDesk, adding:  ""But I think this case is just another pure scam. Everything was just copy-pasted.""  Another red flag: where Pink Taxi Coin's content was original, it was extremely poorly written.  On Telegram, for example, the company wrote, ""Great news.. Jhon Mcafee join PinkTaxiCoin as an advisor..."" Plus the heading of one page on its site is ""Get Yourself Register"" – yet the instructions for depositing ether are written in clear, idiomatic English.  The general inability to produce decent English copy anywhere except when it came to the directions for sending the company money is suspicious, especially for a project that claims to be based in the UK.  Repeat  Pink Taxi Coin was caught in the act of plagiarizing A2B Taxi – actually, the A2B Taxi team called them out on Twitter.  After that, Pink Taxi Coin issued a statement (through McAfee, in a tweet that's since been deleted) expressing ""sincere apologies to all the parties harmed by this activity.""  The statement explained that Pink Taxi Group Ltd. U.K. had hired an unnamed ""third-party agency"" to develop its website and marketing materials, and that this agency was the one to blame for the plagiarism. It went further, saying that Pink Taxi Group has ""launched legal notice to the agency"" and, of course, fired it.  As a result, Pink Taxi Coin took its white paper down, replacing it with a promise to publish a new one soon, and the homepage was altered to look less like A2B Taxi's.  Yet, Walsh doesn't buy it, primarily because it seems the company is at it again.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Despite the announcement from Pink Taxi about this error, our team also determined that their website still contains plagiarism.""  Following the apology, Walsh continued, Pink Taxi Coin's prototype page continued to use images of another ride-hailing application, Lyft, merely stripping the Lyft branding away. That page was not archived and is no longer available.  Separately, CoinDesk also found that text on the updated Pink Taxi Coin site about ""women economic empowerment"" is plagiarized from a European Parliament report.  Where's the team?  What was very different between A2B Taxi and Pink Taxi Coin's site and white paper was Pink Taxi Coin's lack of a legitimate team, another serious red flag for investors looking at which ICO projects to invest in.  Where A2B Taxi's website listed a team including the founder, developers, designers and advisors, Pink Taxi Coin's page listed an ""advisory team"" of three: John McAfee, his wife Janice McAfee and Sherri (just Sherri). And Pink Taxi Coin's white paper left out the ""team"" section – present in A2B Taxi's original – entirely.  There is no indication anywhere in Pink Taxi Coin's materials about who is building the product. The founder's name is not available, nor are the names of any developers or other employees.  And this led Kaseta to comment that Pink Taxi Coin has ""no real people behind [the] project.""  CoinDesk sent emails requesting information about the team to Pink Taxi Coin's support address multiple times, eventually getting this response: ""Your request have been forward to the concerned department.""  And mirroring the experience on the website, when CoinDesk asked about how to deposit ether, we got a detailed answer almost immediately.  The statement apologizing for Pink Taxi Coin's plagiarism insisted that skeptics could search online to confirm that the company exists. Yet the company fails to stick to a consistent name throughout the one-page document: ""Pink Taxi Group Ltd. U.K.,"" at the top, becomes ""Team, Pink Taxi Ltd."" in the signature.  According to Pink Taxi Coin, ""Our authenticity speaks for itself.""  Celebrity endorsement  As previously mentioned, an endorsement from McAfee isn't looked at with pride by many in the cryptocurrency space today.  And there's good reason. Shortly after tweeting about his support of the Pink Taxi Coin project – and making apparently untrue statements about the company, for example, that it currently operates in 50 cities – McAfee revealed that he'd charged $500,000 for the tweet.  Furthermore, when A2B Taxi's art director Tomas Stasiulevicius asked McAfee why he was promoting a project that ""bluntly steals"" others' work, McAfee responded with what Kaseta called ""threatening posts.""  ""You are a scammer my friend,"" McAfee told Stasiulevicius, adding, ""I strongly suggest you drop this, unless you would like my FULL attention?""  That said, it's not just McAfee who should raise alarm bells when investigating ICOs.  After a spate of celebrities began endorsing various ICO projects, the SEC sent out a warning to investors about these kinds of endorsements, going so far as to say that the celebrities could be running afoul of ""anti-touting"" laws if they don't state what compensation they received.  Not only that, but several of these celebrity-endorsed crypto token projects have faced legal sanction – for example, the founders of Centra, a project that boxer Floyd Mayweather endorsed, face federal fraud charges. Another ICO, Bitcoiin, which was endorsed by actor Steven Segal, received cease-and-desist orders from the state of New Jersey.  Media hijacking  Another way Pink Taxi Coin tried to cultivate an aura of legitimacy is by presenting articles from reputable news outlets as if they were referring to the team behind Pink Taxi Coin itself.  ""It is extremely convenient for them,"" Walsh said, ""that there are existing videos and articles talking about the Pink Taxi concept, which they gladly link to on their homepage, as it helps prop up this company's alleged legitimacy in the eyes of would-be investors.""  These materials exist because pink taxis – which cater only to women and hire exclusively women drivers – are a legitimate, working business model in many cities around the world. Indeed, the concept has proven popular in cities where the rates of sexual assault are high, including several cities in Muslim-majority countries, as well as in Latin America and Britain.  Pink taxis are a just that, though: a concept, not a company. And Pink Taxi Coin seems to be attempting to exploit potential confusion about that fact.  Each of the articles listed on Pink Taxi Coin's site is talking about a separate entity: there's a BBC article about a British company called Pink Ladies, an Al Jazeera article about a Pakistani company called Paxi, a Khaleej Times article about an Emirati company called Dubai Taxi Corp., a Hype article about a Malaysian company called Riding Pink, a Wall Street Journal article about an Indian company called Meru Cab, and a CNN article about an Egyptian company called Pink Taxi.  CoinDesk reached out these companies, and while most did not respond before press time, a Riding Pink representative said:  ""This is a blatant misuse of our brand name and we are not in any way affiliated with Pink Taxi Ltd UK.""  Yet, if that wasn't enough, there's a Medium post by a Kyle Jones – his only post – supporting the company: ""you can't afford to miss this ICO,"" the headline blares.  Except, we dug into the author, and it turns out there is no Kyle Jones. The picture used on Medium is of a college professor who is not named Kyle Jones, did not write the Medium post and is not – he told CoinDesk – in any way associated with Pink Taxi Coin.  Here's your chance  Last, but not least, while the prices of certain cryptocurrencies have skyrocketed since they were first launched (think bitcoin and ethereum), promises of meteoric profit by the ICO issuers themselves are generally a bad sign.  For instance, on Pink Taxi Coin's Telegram channel – whose 1,600 subscribers are not allowed to post – the ICO issuer promised investors outsized profits, comparing it to bitcoin directly.  ""You didn't invest in Bitcoin in 2009. Here's your second chance!"" the post stated, adding: ""You want the rich lavish lifestyle? Put your money where your mouth is!""  It went on, telling investors to buy before others caught on and to embrace the risk.  In case the message wasn't clear enough, a subsequent post said, ""Soon PTT will be trading at 5 $.""  Notably, the $5 price target has been lowered in revisions to the Pink Taxi Coin website. It is $1 at the time of writing.  This kind of promotion, playing to cryptocurrency enthusiasts' (and the wider world's) fear of missing out (FOMO), is such a problem that the SEC has repeatedly warned investors about such advertising. The regulator even went so far as to create a parody site to educate investors on what to look for when deciding whether an ICO investment is legitimate or fraudulent.  Echoing the SEC here, CoinDesk would like to remind you to take a deep breath and do some research before throwing your life savings (or even the change you found on the ground today) into an ICO. In many cases, like Pink Taxi Coin, the red flags aren't hard to spot.

Dubbed Insurwave, the blockchain platform was developed by professional services firm Ernst & Young and software company Guardtime based on Microsoft's Azure cloud-based technology. It was built on top of R3's open-source Corda platform.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the Denmark-based shipping giant Maersk first joined the group in September of last year to deploy the solution in a pilot phase. Other notable participants in the test included insurers MS Amlin and XL Catlin.  The end goal, the group said, is to allow each party in the shipping insurance ecosystem to use a distributed ledger that would record shipment information and automate insurance transactions when needed, which touts an ability to bring efficiency and transparency.  The group expects the platform to execute over half a million automated blockchain transactions for more than 1,000 vessels over the first year of its use in a live, commercial environment.  Further down the road, EY said it also plans to extend the application to other types of business insurance, including global logistics, aviation and energy.  Today's announcement also marks the latest effort by Maersk to actively apply blockchain technology in its operations.  Currently, the firm is also working with IBM to adopt a global trade digitization platform built on the Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 blockchain to record and transact cargo information along the global shipping supply chain.

42401569,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd05ZB,1527208809,The Record-Breaking $152 Million Battle Over the Blockchain Betting Tool Augur,"26-year-old blockchain entrepreneur Matthew Liston has taken four associates to court for conflicts that arose out of his termination from the cryptocurrency betting startup Augur, alleging in a lawsuit filed in San Francisco, California on April 19 that founding members Joseph Ball ""Joe"" Costello, 64, Jack ""John"" Peterson, 35, Joseph Charles ""Joey"" Krug, 22, and Jeremy Gardner, 26, committed acts of fraud, breach of contract and trade theft that left him empty-handed without a stake in an initial coin offering (ICO) and bound to a broken settlement agreement that ignored him as a co-founder.  Named as defendants in the lawsuit are also Augur's Delaware corporate entity Dyffy, Inc. for owing Liston back wages and two Forecast Foundation business entities, one registered in Oregon and the other in Estonia, for operating illegally in the state of California, misappropriating Liston's holdings from Dyffy, and processing the ICO transactions without registering them as securities. An ICO is a tokenized version of a crowdsourced fundraising pool.  According to the lawsuit, Peterson, Gardner and Costello conducted a hostile takeover of Dyffy, Gardner presided as president and Peterson as secretary over the dissolved Oregon non-profit, and all but Costello currently maintain shareholder status in the for-profit Estonian entity headed by Peterson. The entities were made before Augur held one of the first ICOs between August 7 and September 5, 2015 when the company issued 8.8 million reputation (REP) tokens, each priced below $0.60.  The Augur ICO raised over $5 million for a decentralized prediction market protocol that would run on the ethereum blockchain. Advised by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Lightning Labs co-founder Elizabeth Stark, the betting application claims censorship-resistance from platform providers and government bodies. In July 2018, Augur is launching its main network in what the industry has hailed as one of the more compelling blockchain experiments to be designed by the award-winning IDEO design group.  But Liston is seeking $38 million in general damages and $114 million in punitive damages for a total of $152 million in collective damages that could put a damper on those resources — more than one-quarter of REP's market value. Three years after the ICO, in a time when cryptocurrencies have gained mainstream momentum, REP has traded as high as $100 and token holders have profited up to 200 times on their principal investments.  The legal action also constitutes the most financially significant private lawsuit in cryptocurrency history so far, superseding even damages sought by industry class-action lawsuits brought againstcryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, the Nano cryptocurrency previously known as RaiBlocks, and token-backed marijuana startup Paragon Coin, which have exceeded more than $100 million in possible payouts.  Krug, who still advises Augur, denied the lawsuit's claims and disputed the extent of Liston's role in the project in a statement to CoinDesk.  ""The claims are baseless and inaccurate. [Liston] accepted a cash severance payment and he signed a full release with Dyffy and we're appalled that he's turned around with a lawsuit three years later. There hasn't been a single GitHub commit by Liston, on any of the Augur repositories. He's not a founder of Augur,"" Krug said.  Gardner wrote in an email that many of the claims are ""demonstrably false"" and ""this is a superfluous lawsuit if there ever was one.""  O. Shane Balloun of Balloun Law filed the complaint on Liston's behalf. Balloun did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CoinDesk, nor did Costello, Peterson and Cooley LLP attorney Patrick Gibbs, who is said to be representing the entire defense.  The court has scheduled a hearing in September 2018 for both sides to attend, where the case will be assigned a judge and a trial date will be set.  Losing a company  In June 2014, Liston registered Dyffy and hired Peterson to pursue a ""blockchain-enabled betting and prediction market,"" the lawsuit says. Peterson, at first unsure about the idea, changed his mind after Liston brought him into conversations with Costello and Yale economist Paul Sztorc.  Liston read Sztorc's Truthcoin whitepaper about cryptocurrency prediction markets and successfully pitched the business to Costello for an investment, according to the lawsuit. Krug and Gardner were then recruited to Dyffy to work on the project, which they began calling Augur.  ""[Liston] was the one who found me,"" Sztorc said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""He found me and the code I had written and he introduced it to Jack and then he kind of brought Dyffy around into working on this prediction market idea I had published, which was called Truthcoin at the time.""  Getting the all-clear from Peterson and Costello still did not pan out. After butting heads with Peterson and Costello, Liston was removed from Dyffy and its board of directors on October 24, 2014, a power play Gardner allegedly ""instigated and conspired with Defendants Peterson and Costello"" to take Liston down and install new management, according to the lawsuit.  Krug replaced Liston as director and Peterson stepped in for Liston as CEO and CTO so the new Augur leadership could unlawfully move Liston's intellectual property and financial assets into the Forecast Foundation non-profit established in Oregon state on December 23, 2014, the lawsuit alleges.  Liston claims this attempted merger or acquisition was unlawful because he preserved contractual ownership within Dyffy and maintained all rights to his work, capital and shares but never signed off on an agreement affecting their transfer past his departure, including for what he says is the Truthcoin research he adapted into the technology that would come to underlie Augur's REP coin.  Forecast Foundation also was not registered and licensed to do business in California, where Augur operated out of San Francisco, according to the lawsuit.  Not over yet  The paper ties came back to haunt Liston. Even after being fired, Liston was held liable for a $15,000 lawsuit filed against Dyffy by a contractor seeking payment for services rendered. The lawsuit alleges Peterson, Krug, Gardner and Costello neglected their fiduciary duty by not upholding corporate indemnity defenses that would have conferred the cost burdens of legal actions from Liston to Dyffy after he parted ways.  Yet they were keen on severing these lingering contractual associations. Following the ousting, the lawsuit alleges, Costello verbally and textually harassed Liston to sign an agreement certifying bars on future legal action against Dyffy, and another agreement relinquishing 100% of Liston's equity in a buyback deal that would return cash and REP.  Costello ""screamed indignities at [Liston] every time they spoke on the phone"" and sent time-sensitive ultimatums ordering that Liston either take or leave the deal in ""a series of highly coercive, unrelenting, manipulative communications"" and chronically ""abusive"" phone calls from April 13 to April 15, 2015 to the point where Liston ""broke down in frustration,"" according to the lawsuit, which cites a series of harrowing messages.  ""If we don't settle this today and tomorrow then you will receive nothing,"" Costello messaged Liston on April 14, 2015. ""If I don't hear from you in the morning, the answer is that you are not excepting [accepting, sic] the deal and we restructure,"" Costello warned Liston, who did not yet respond that day, three hours later. ""Two hours left,"" Costello drew the line on April 15, 2015.  Liston, hesitant to reciprocate Costello's legal offers, made it clear more than once in the conversations he wanted to obtain legal counsel to review the documents. However, lacking the financial resources to hire a lawyer and the mettle to withstand Costello's ""abusive tactics"" which he felt would likely persist, Liston signed the two agreements and ""capitulated to Dyffy and Costello's demands"" on April 19, 2015, according to the lawsuit.    Liston now says he did so too soon, having went as far as revising the agreements to eliminate the REP tokens — 5% of the crowdsale — for $65,000 in all cash because the defendants ""concealed their specific plans for an initial coin offering of the REP token."" The tumultuous circumstances around his firing in October 2014 led him to believe the REP tokens were worthless and being offered ""to avoid paying him anything of real value.""      Liston says he later learned Augur's ICO plans were more complex, extensive and optimistic than were presented to him. Per contract law, Liston argues, the ICO's projected market valuation and team allocations should have been thoroughly demonstrated in the negotiations.    Additionally, Liston claims, also by law, the coercion and duress he faced should have invalidated the contracts. Had he been given more wiggle room and emotional clarity to negotiate the terms of the agreements with legal advice, Liston believes he would have better understood the ICO and accepted a portion of the REP tokens that would have ballooned in value to the amount in legal damages he is currently seeking.  If not through a direct offer, Liston claims the Augur team should have endowed him REP by virtue of his Dyffy shares. His ousting, he reasons, would have met the two elements of a double-trigger acceleration clause — involuntary termination and sale of the company — to automatically vest and convert his company shares into an active cut of the ICO.  Augur sold the company by transferring Dyffy holdings into the Estonian for-profit company Forecast Foundation OÜ as was allegedly done with the Oregonian non-profit Forecast Foundation, the lawsuit says, which is why Liston believes Peterson, Krug and Gardner own corresponding share percentages in Dyffy and Forecast Foundation OÜ.  Violating the agreements  According to the lawsuit, Peterson repeatedly refused to honor Liston as an Augur co-founder. Because both parties agreed to this term in the settlement, or so the lawsuit claims, Liston alleges the contractual relationship was violated. (""Getting new agreement written up...you are shown as a founder of augur [sic]...,"" Costello updated Liston on April 16, 2015, the lawsuit references.)  The lawsuit says Peterson also revealed fraudulent intent in the legal back-and-forth by ""block[ing] all potential press releases and reject[ing] all public media statements"" for the ICO that mentioned Liston as a co-founder. The lawsuit says Peterson rebuffed appeals in November 2015 to identify Liston's role at Augur before the ICO went live.  Two years later, when Liston started working for Gnosis, a decentralized ethereum application similar to Augur, Peterson then reached out to Liston's boss Martin Köppelman to ""try to convince him to lean on Plaintiff Liston to stop referring himself as a co-founder of Augur"" before altogether denying Liston's co-foundership in two January 2018 tweets, according to the lawsuit.  Liston claimed he was a co-founder in social media posts, the lawsuit explains, triggering Augur frontman Peterson to publicly disavow him and privately send him a cease-and-desist letter through Forecast Foundation OÜ.  A representative of Augur shortly thereafter emailed Ryan John King, whose blockchain map company FOAM Liston advises, using ""aggressive and disparaging language demanding FOAM remove the phrase 'Augur cofounder' from Liston's description on FOAM's website,"" according to the lawsuit.  Peterson also advanced a vastly differing account of his relationship with Liston in the public eye, CoinDesk found. Peterson said he personally knew Liston years ago in a StackExchange post made in September 2017 under his online pseudonym ""tinybike,"" but depicted his former co-worker as a ""random Internet guy"" in tweets earlier this year that were cited in the lawsuit.  Conflicting takes  Sztorc, who published a critical exposé on Augur in December 2015, told CoinDesk he sympathizes with Liston, noting the unexpected medical condition of Liston's ex-girlfriend when he was abruptly let go. In the lawsuit, Liston reports ""suffering from profound financial and economic pressure"" in the same time frame due to the ""sustained period of unemployment"" that resulted from his ""sudden termination"" from Augur.  Liston was not the only member of Augur whom Sztorc thought was treated unfairly. The Truthcoin founder criticized the project for compensating software engineer Zackary ""Zack"" Hess meagerly after he developed the early stages of the project, often for hours into the night.  ""I was working with the Augur team before it was called Augur. I wrote their first minimum viable product in Python. I taught them Paul Sztorc's design,"" Amoveo founder Hess commented to CoinDesk.  Amoveo, described by Hess as ""an improved version of Augur that costs less to use and doesn't have any REP token,"" connects markets to an on-chain oracle mechanism and makes bets inside bitcoin lightning network channels.  Asked why Liston was booted out, Sztorc said the company was vying for more technically savvy leadership. The Truthcoin founder remembered Costello called him one time asking what the project needed.  ""I said, 'It needed programmers'. Matt wasn't really a programmer,"" Sztorc said.  Another source familiar with the matter, however, said Liston originally pushed for Augur to operate on top of the ethereum blockchain to process predictions more efficiently, but his advice was initially shunned in favor of the bitcoin blockchain.  ""[Liston] ended up being right,"" the source said. Augur switched from the original blockchain to its second-generation successor after Liston exited.  Since moving on from Augur, Liston has also worked at the ethereum project and the blockchain software studio ConsenSys. Peterson and Pantera Capital co-CIO Krug are still active with Augur. Gardner is a partner at Ausum Ventures and was an EIR at Blockchain Capital. Costello sits on the Augur advisory board and manages smart building company, Enlighted, Inc. Siemens is expected to close its acquisition of Enlighted in the third fiscal quarter of this year.  Augur symbol via Shutterstock    Matthew Liston v.
