42425567,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIW2jh,1394751249,Mintspare Will Pay Bitcoin For Your Old Electronics,"Consumers can now receive bitcoin when they trade in old electronics through a new startup called Mintspare.  Galfry Puechavy, Mintspare's CEO, told CoinDesk that the company's goal is to be a simple way to get started with bitcoin:  ""It's just allows people to get in very, very easily. I personally haven't seen a simpler way to acquire bitcoins,"" said Puechavy.  How it works  Mintspare has its own bitcoin wallet that it provides to customers when an account is created. Users choose a device that they want to trade in, select the model and then evaluate its condition.  Mintspare then generates a prepaid shipping label and the user sends it in for BTC. Explained Puechavy:  ""When we receive your iPhone or iPad, after verifying and diagnosing it and making sure it's the right model we just send out your funds to your Mintspare wallet within 24 hours.""  Mintspare's goal is to introduce newcomers to owning their first bitcoins.  Puechavy believes that the verification procedures required for exchanges ""scare"" potential bitcoin enthusiasts. Instead, bitcoin for gadgets is an alternative onramp to the crytpocurrency ecosystem Mintspare provides.  Electronics for bitcoin  Mintspare isn't the only company that takes bitcoin for used devices. Glyde, a Palo Alto-based startup, also pays out in bitcoin for gadgets.  But, Glyde is a marketplace that connects sellers with buyers and also pays out in dollars. Mintspare is a trade-in program focused solely on fueling bitcoin adoption.  ""Glyde is a different model than what we have. They still have their purpose, but the main goal of Mintspare is to alleviate the friction of starting with ownership with bitcoin.""  Like Glyde, Mintspare has a referral program. But it's a bit different: With Glyde, users who refer customers get $5 per sign up. Mintspare's program is on a sliding scale based on the amount of BTC a user's trade-ins are worth.  ""We have a referral program that we opened up after the beta. Now we're ready to go full throttle,"" Puechavy said.  Values and transparency  Mintspare makes a valuation on used devices based on a number of sources.  It has put together its own proprietary resource that allows the company to determine the dollar value of a gadget. It then converts that to bitcoin. Said Puechavy:  ""We have our own database. It comes from multiple sources. We just have an average from those sources that we get our numbers from.""  The company believes that in order to sell the Mintspare idea to prospective users, it is key to provide as much information as possible.  Being a bitcoin-based business means Mintspare has to offer prompt customer engagement and education. Many people are still wary of BTC, so providing a level of comfort is important. Puechavy is aware of this, and told CoinDesk:  ""[Mintspare is] very transparent, the entire process. It's a huge issue.""  More about Mintspare  The company began a private beta one month ago, with limitations on the number of devices that could be sent in, and opened to the public this week.  The startup is a project that Puechavy and a small globally distributed team has been working on for six months.  ""Because we deal in bitcoin,we have employees around the world. This is really the first time in the world that you can really seamlessly integrate an international team,"" he said.  ""There are so many benefits from bitcoin that you don't realize until you are given the circumstances. This is something impressive,"" Puechavy said.  Mintspare signups are now open to anyone who has devices to trade in for bitcoin.

42425564,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIW2Zh,1394744452,Xapo Raises $20 Million for 'Ultra-Secure' Bitcoin Storage,"California-based bitcoin security company Xapo has raised $20m as part of an initial round of fundraising led by Benchmark, Fortress Investment Group and Ribbit Capital.  The funding round is the second largest public round in the bitcoin space, trailing Coinbase's $25m Series B completed in December, but coming in ahead of Circle's $9m Series A round in October.  Founded by Wences Casares, former CEO and founder of digital wallet startup Lemon, the company maintains bitcoin cold storage facilities in two undisclosed locations.  Casares invoked his Argentinian background when talking about the company, noting his parents routinely lost money due to rapid inflation and deflation in his home country, and that as such, providing protection to clients against this risk is a matter he takes seriously.  Said Casares:  ""I recognize that those are extremes but, when you grow up in that environment you become much more aware of problems with currency. So, when I saw bitcoin it was like a dream.""  The vaults claim to have enhanced security. For example, their servers were never online, meaning that no cybercriminals can fingerprint them as a means to steal information. Further, all the bitcoin in Xapo's vaults are insured.  Fortress revealed in February that it bought $20m worth of bitcoins as part of its experimentation in the sector, while Ribbit Capital was founded by Bitcoin Foundation board member Micky Malka.  Service overview  Currently, Xapo holds bitcoin for large commercial customers such as hedge funds, family offices and wealth funds. Users pay 12 basis points a year for the service.  Benchmark partner Matt Cohler indicated that he believes the funding round is a natural step for the ecosystem, noting that he expects bitcoin users to eventually pick storage service providers the way they do banks.  Said Cohler:  ""You'll want to understand the company's credibility, backing and solvency. In this case, you have a company led by one of the most important people in the bitcoin ecosystem, it's insured and has investors from both Silicon Valley and Wall Street.""  2014 in startup funding  The Xapo funding is by far the largest round yet registered this year, in what has been a slow few months for funding. To date, the largest rounds in 2014 have been for Asian companies such as Singapore-based ATM manufacturer Tembusu and South Korean bitcoin exchange Korbit, both of which raised under $500,000.  However, if earlier predictions hold true it may not be one of the largest for long, as venture capital firms are still bullish on bitcoin's prospects across all sectors of the industry.

42425568,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIW2hh,1394738599,How to Increase Public Confidence in Bitcoin Exchanges,"Digital currency exchanges have faced some trying times of late, with lawsuits due to negligence, closures because of regulatory pressure and collapses brought on by outright theft. All of which have fuelled the bitcoin media frenzy in recent weeks.  With so much dour news, what is the best way forward for the bitcoin industry? Are there methods to prove that an exchange has the asset holdings that it claims?  In fact, there are ways to verify this vital information, but implementing them will be a challenge.  Lack of disclosure  When doing business with a digital currency exchange, events like those mentioned above mean it is getting more difficult to entrust your bitcoins to hosted wallets and mysterious accounting structures.  Furthermore, to protect their interests, most exchanges do not disclose this sort of information.  Proprietary business knowledge is important to protect, of course, but surely transparency would be a better safeguard than a damaging leak, as seems to have happened with Mt. Gox.  There are certainly worthwhile digital currency exchanges that are trying to move bitcoin in a positive direction, but there have been far too many that have had serious problems.  Fiat currency institutions are not immune from all this, of course – payment card issuers, merchants and acquiring banks lost $11.27 billion to fraud in the calendar year 2012.  However, given the issues surrounding decentralised digital currencies, criminals are looking to profit within this environment. It's low-hanging fruit versus the highly regulated banking industry's estimated $1 trillion in IT spending year-over-year in the United States alone.  These problems permeate the mind and create a degree of uncertainty and mistrust concerning the industry. So, what can be done?  Public transparency  Proving legitimacy within the digital currency industry is becoming ever more important. When Bitstamp conducts audits and Coinbase allows a third party to review its infrastructure, this creates positive sentiment that there are people in the bitcoin sphere doing things correctly.  Jaron Lukasiewicz is the CEO and founder of Coinsetter. The company is an exchange and has a trading platform that links in with other exchange APIs.  Lukasiewicz has been gathering consensus about adopting a public transparency system. Coinsetter's goal is to enable proof. Said Lukasiewicz:  ""You can prove that you have a total amount of assets on the one hand and then prove or demonstrate the balance.""  'Trustless proof' of solvency gives exchange users a way to confirm that an exchange is doing what it says. It's influenced by Gregory Maxwell's proposal of 'nodes', which has seen increased interest over recent weeks.  Lukasiewicz explains the idea thus:  ""What would happen is no one would ever know who a person is. They will benefit from cryptographic proof that shows their 10,000 BTC, for example, is theirs. I think any sort of downside is outweighed by the potential upside.""  Many exchanges are doing the right thing, but Coinsetter wants to go even further. Lukasiewicz is hoping that other exchanges will see the significance of an initiative like this.  ""No one would give up privacy in the interest of assets. All I know is what we’re doing, but my hope is that other exchanges [will] do it,"" he said.  Smart contracts  One problem with public transparency is that while it does provide information, how can you tell if the data you are getting is accurate?  Perhaps public transparency is only part of the equation. Smart contracts could further benefit everyone and are integrated within the Bitcoin protocol itself.  What a smart contract would do is guarantee users the existence of funds. When it comes to the US dollar and traditional banking, it is understood that the system is based on the backing of the federal government.  Bitcoin lacks a third party in the form of a powerful financial institution, so legitimacy may require reliance on some sort of cryptographic contract.  There are a number of efforts currently under way to provide smart contract concepts in some alternative digital currencies. However, employing this type of safeguard within bitcoin might be the most important goal for influencing adoption as a whole.  The banking industry is one sector that needs to see the iterative potential of digital currencies. Innovation in bitcoin would be one way to prove that the protocol can better adapt to the needs of the people than fiat currencies.  Mike Hearn, who oversees development of the bitcoinj Java client, has said that overall bitcoin development is falling behind, attributing the problem to fewer people putting in effort to move things forward.  Lukasiewicz agrees, and said that one of the reasons why he started the conversation is the lack of one right now:  ""Bitcoin as a protocol, it’s had additions, it’s had fixes, but it hasn’t innovated on some of the more novel but very important things.""  Inherent risks  No matter if it is credit cards, banking or bitcoin there are always financial risks. Even transparency can come at a cost, because more information is being given out to those who may want to intrude and steal.  New ideas like security crowdsourcing are helping to combat this. The startup CrowdCurity, for example, brings more eyes to application-level security in the form of rewards-based incentives.  However, no matter how much is spent on securing a system, someone will always be there to try to get in. Just ask the banking industry.  Not everyone will like the idea of public transparency and/or utilizing smart contracts within bitcoin exchanges. Those uncomfortable with such ideas may simply go elsewhere.  When presented with that notion, Lukasiewicz couldn't deny that people will always have options, but he contends that the expectation of privacy within this system is part of the plan. As he explained:  ""People would probably go to other exchanges, but what I would say is that all the initiatives we’re looking to implement are anonymous. No one would give up privacy in the interests of assets.""  That is, at least, an improvement over the services existing financial providers offer.

42425556,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIW2Jh,1394733790,Bitcoin Proves Just the Tonic for London Gin Distillery,"UK Bitcoin holders can now spend their digital currency on a bottle of Dodd’s Gin or a 109 Cask, both distilled by The London Distillery Company (TLDC).  TLDC joins a growing list of merchants in London that are now accepting bitcoin. The distillery only opened their digital doors to cryptocurrencies this Monday and have since been surprised by the response from the community.  Chief Executive Darren Rook did not expect such immediate feedback:  ""I've been amazed by the number of people who actually tried to do transactions through the website. It's been pretty incredible actually. I don't think I realised how many people have bitcoin and are looking for services outside of trading.""  Located at the south end of Battersea Bridge, TLDC can be found in an old Victoria dairy. Neighbouring vendors and businesses include an art collective, a boxing gym and a bar.  Rook says that once his business has ironed out all the technicalities with accepting bitcoin, he will bring up the idea to others as well.  ""We are looking at our neighbours to say 'We can accept bitcoin; maybe you should look at it too because we'll have people coming through.' Our plan is to iron out the issues that we'll potentially have and then go to everyone and say this is the opportunity.""  Currently, BitPay has only approved TLDC for transactions under £55 ($100) per day, but they are hoping to raise that limit by the end of the next week. In the meantime, some customers who tried to order pricier items were met with disappointment.  ""We saw someone from America trying to do a cask purchase worth £1,000, but because of the authorisation limits we have in place at the moment it couldn't go through,"" says Rook. But, he admits that he is excited to see a new clientele who want to use their bitcoin.  Rook also revealed that TLDC is also considering installing a Bitcoin ATM on site, similar to the machine over the river in the Old Shoreditch Station Cafe. Cheers to that, Londoners.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS,Roop Gill,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/13/bitcoin-proves-just-the-tonic-for-london-gin-distillery,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c0406b618a8f360b2bf07f1f02a2813bb9820da-840x560.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374535,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlGxr,1394730449,Mobile Ad Platform Vungle Offers Publishers Payouts in Bitcoin,"Good news for mobile app developers who want more options when getting paid from their advertising revenue: mobile advertising platform Vungle has just announced plans to offer their publishers the option to receive payments in bitcoin.  Vungle is one of Silicon Valley’s fastest growing companies in the mobile app monetization space, and after receiving $17m in series B fundraising last month, the tech company is looking to expand its reach.  The move to start offering bitcoin payouts to the publishers of more than 4,000 apps on the Vungle network comes in response to demand from app developers who expressed their desire for more flexibility in receiving payments from their advertising revenues, says Vungle’s VP of Marketing Andrea Sharfin:  “A lot of our independent app developers showed interest in bitcoin payments. These are usually teams of 2-3 people, working on their own out of a garage. These are the people who can especially benefit from the lower transaction fees associated with getting paid in bitcoin.”  More benefits for publishers  Sharfin explains that in addition to the lower transaction fees that come with bitcoin payments (around 1%, as opposed to 3-5% with credit cards), publishers that opt to receive payment in bitcoin will also receive their money much faster.  Bitcoin payments are processed and delivered almost instantaneously, while credit card payments and bank transfers can take days.  Vungle has partnered with Coinbase to provide more flexibility for the roster of app developers in their network, and with mobile platforms becoming increasingly popular with the general population, publishers have started to place their focus on monetizing mobile content.  No stranger to bitcoin  Although Vungle has just started offering payments in bitcoin to their publishers, the platform has been keeping an eye on the digital currency, and Sharfin says the company has even been offering its employees the option to be reimbursed for expense reports with bitcoin “for some time”.  Building on comments from Vungle’s CEO Zain Jaffer that Vungle has a “long view” on bitcoin, Sharfin explained the company’s decision to offer bitcoin payouts as just one aspect of their progressive stance in the technology industry:  “Of course we can’t speak in certain terms, but we would love to be bullish in our long term prospects for bitcoin. For us, working with bitcoin helps us embrace our future in the tech industry as a leading monetization platform for apps.”  The value of feedback  Feedback from a number of their publishers acted as an impetus for Vungle to offer bitcoin as a payment method, and the company will continue to rely on this feedback to offer the most value for app developers on their network, says Sharfin.  When asked if Vungle expects to see a wave of new publishers from the bitcoin community joining their network, Sharfin was optimistic:  “We would love to see new customers joining the network, and we really hope that adding this flexibility for our existing partners helps maximize their profits and ease some financial stress. We will continue to rely on feedback from publishers in response to offering bitcoin payouts.”  Vungle currently works with a number of big names in a variety of industries to provide in-app advertisements for developers like Sega, Zeptolab and Wooga, all of whom now have the ability to get paid in bitcoin.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Tom Sharkey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/13/mobile-ad-platform-vungle-offers-publishers-payouts-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db9343d47ac63fa3722aed9359d2037b3dbcac26-1029x692.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitfinex  , which is incorporated in Hong Kong, has been on CoinDesk’s radar for possible inclusion in the BPI for some time now.  Over the past several weeks, and particularly since the decline of Mt. Gox, we have observed that Bitfinex has been able to sustain a dramatic increase in its share of the total volume of US dollar-denominated bitcoins traded.  CoinDesk has also verified that Bitfinex meets the CoinDesk BPI criteria, which include rules ranging from minimum trade size to maximum customer withdrawal delays.  Three horse race  In late 2013, Bitfinex was already the fourth largest exchange. However, it was a distant fourth compared to the big three exchanges that comprised the BPI during this time: Bitstamp, BTC-e, and Mt. Gox – all of which averaged at least 30% of US dollar-denominated bitcoin trading volume (see Table 1).  In contrast, for much of late November and December in 2013, Bitfinex’s overall share of total US dollar-denominated bitcoin trading volume was in the single digits, averaging only 6% of the total.  Rapid rise  Much has changed in the bitcoin exchange world since December, starting with Bitfinex surpassing the now bankrupt Mt. Gox on several days of trading in January.  Bitfinex also recently leapfrogged BTC-e, another BPI component, with more US dollar-denominated bitcoins exchanged in five of the last six trading days, and almost half of the past 29 trading days (see Table 2).

Launched at the end of January, Pock.io has become the first British service to exchange retailer gift cards for digital currencies – with eight different cryptocoins currently accepted.  Pock.io CEO and co-founder Rusty Nash said that the driving force behind the launch of this service was to make digital currencies more mainstream in the UK.  Pock.io’s business model is similar to that of the California-based mobile gift card wallet, Gyft, which started accepting bitcoin last May. Gyft has since expanded to Canada with a limited number of retailers, but hasn’t made the leap across the pond yet.  Some UK users have reported being unable to use their Gyft gift cards on Amazon.co.uk, while others have reported problems with shipping restrictions into the UK with items purchased on the Amazon.com site.  Wide-open market  Nash said he noticed that there was a gap in the British market for this kind of service.  “I had the idea of gift cards even before I knew Gyft and other competitors were available. When I did my research, I obviously found them in the US market, but there was nothing in the UK. I saw a gap that not only I wanted to fill, but needed to be filled.”  Even though Pock.io is only a couple of months old, Nash is already planning to expand the service across Europe. He eventually also wants to take it to America and Canada, where he will face competition from Gyft and eGifter. He says what sets his company apart is that it accepts a variety of digital currencies, not just bitcoin.  “We match [Gyft and eGifter] on the fact that we have zero per cent commission. But, our main difference is the fact that we accept multiple cryptocurrencies.”  Community focused  Currently, Pock.io is accepting bitcoin, percoin, litecoin, dogecoin, maxcoin, vertcoin, worldcoin and quark. Nash said that they would continue to add more currencies based on the community’s requests.  “We listen to the community and we have managed to grow so fast because we like to take direction from the community,” says Nash.  True to Nash's word, Pock.io removed Apple from its gift card selection following the Cupercino-based company's controversial decision to remove Blockchain's wallet app from the App Store.    We are removing Apple gift cards per the #Bitcoin community's request #cryptocurrency      — pockio (@pockiouk) March 11, 2014    While iTunes products may no longer be available via Pock.io, the company is working on adding more merchants to its network.

The move means merchants using the platform will soon be able to accept payments in the canine currency, in addition to GoCoin's existing currencies, bitcoin and litecoin.  “We’ve been carefully prioritizing the latest altcoins, and dogecoin really stands out as a viable currency due, in large part, to the strength of its community,” said GoCoin founder and CEO Steve Beauregard.  “By integrating dogecoin into our platform, GoCoin is one step closer to giving merchants the ability to accept any digital currency and increase sales with new shoppers.”  ""We expect to be live with dogecoin with the next few weeks,"" he added.  Wow payments  GoCoin, which is based in Singapore, started rolling out merchant payments in bitcoin late in 2013, expanding to include litecoin in January of this year.  The payment platform helps merchants from around the globe accept cryptocurrency payments on their websites by providing options at checkout. Several methods can be employed, from a full app payments systems to hosted forms or buttons.  Merchants pay a 1% fee to start with, which drops to 0% after transactions have passed $2,500 US$ per month.  The company says its ""proprietary back-end systems optimize coin exchange for cash, eliminating volatility and security risk"".  Pls send  Dogecoin has become famous for being a joke coin featuring a shiba inu dog on its logo, that – to everyone's surprise – has actually started accruing value since its inception in December 2013.  However, its relatively low price against the US dollar (1 dogecoin = $0.0008618 at the time of publishing), means it has been less a domain for serious investors; instead developing a community of supporters that enjoy using the currency for tipping and more altruistic purposes.  The dogecoin community is known for its slightly off-the-wall fundraising campaigns, such as raising $30,000 to help the Jamaican bobsleigh team get to the Sochi Winter Olympics. More recently, the Dogecoin Foundation has kicked off a campaign to raise $50,000 for new water wells in a drought-hit region of Kenya.  Said Kevin Beauregard, GoCoin's VP of engineering:  ""We love the ethos of the dogecoin community and our merchants are ready to accept it alongside bitcoin and litecoin.”  The fact that the cryptocurrency is being accepted by more businesses indicates that it is increasingly been seen as a viable coin for standard commercial transactions.  Much problems  However, while the fledgling currency has proved a surprise hit, it has been plagued with problems.  Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have posed severe problems for mining pools, which have suffered lost mining time and stolen coins.  In the case of Dogepool.pw, at least 15 million coins were taken from the pool’s master wallet, and TeamDoge was struck numerous times by hackers who assaulted the stratum software that is used to coordinate the collective computing power of all the miners.  Furthermore, 'multipools' – mining groups that use their hashing power to mine whichever coin is most profitable at a given moment – have been targeting a flaw in the currency to cherry-pick blocks with large rewards, which were found to be pre-calculable.  Multipool visits have also caused sudden surges in the hash-rate, which increased the difficulty of mining for solo miners, and also left them with the crumbs of the mining rewards.  Very fixed?  In news announced today, however, the altcoin's developers have announced version 1.6 of the dogecoin wallet client (to be found here). This mandatory update introduces changes designed to avoid the problems arising from marauding multipools.  This is a mandatory update as it involves a hard fork of the network. Users should make sure they are running 1.6 to ensure that they're on the correct block chain and not at risk of losing their DOGE.  Most notably, block rewards (which had been random) will be a flat 250,000 DOGE to prevent cherry-picking, and a new DigiShield difficulty algorithm will allow the mining difficulty to adjust almost instantly after a multipool visit.  While the update won't solve all of dogecoin's issues, it will go some way towards making life easier for the small-scale miners in this doge-eat-doge world.",POSITIVE,DOGE,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | MINING | FORKS,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/13/gocoin-announces-dogecoin-integration-as-client-update-tackles-mining-issues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c9fb2ad8810d46c2c69d3ea3e1f26dc47d101e8-1024x687.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425560,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIW2Rh,1394715762,Bank of England: Digital Currencies are Similar to Commodities,"The Bank of England (BoE) has published an article on the role of money in the modern economy and one topic was the future of digital currencies and payment technologies. The currency v commodity debate has been going on for a while and the Bank of England is clearly on the commodity side of the argument.  ""Digital currencies are not at present widely used as a medium of exchange. Instead, their popularity largely derives from their ability to serve as an asset class. As such they may have more conceptual similarities to commodities, such as gold, than money,"" the bank concluded.  Not a generally accepted medium of exchange  Digital currencies were brought up in the context of alternative currencies and recent developments in payment technologies. The advent of e-money and services like PayPal and Google Wallet was discussed and the bank concluded that these forms of money have similar features to bank deposits.  ""For example, money in an e-money account represents a store of value so long as the companies providing it are seen as trustworthy. E-money can also be used as a medium of exchange with businesses (such as online sellers) or individuals that accept it,"" the report points out, adding:  ""However, it is still not as widely accepted as other media of exchange, for instance, it is not generally accepted by high street shops. Transactions using these technologies are also typically denominated in the existing unit of account (pounds sterling in the United Kingdom).""  Digital currencies are quite a bit different, since they can be created out of nothing and their exchange rate is not fixed. The supply of digital currencies is typically limited, which is not the case with e-money accounts.  The bank also outlines some basic differences between local currencies and digital currencies. The former are issued in a defined environment, they are not decentralised and they are usually bought in exchange for currency at fixed rates. This of course is not the case with digital currencies, as they do not have a fixed rate and they are practically their own unit of account.  Bank of England not to keen to weigh in  The Bank of England has not said much about bitcoin in the past. It seems it simply does not think bitcoin is big enough to worry about, or as the bank puts it:  “The current levels of economic activity and payments involving bitcoin are too light to have a material impact on [the bank's] monetary or financial stability objectives in the short term.""  This is not the case with most European central banks and the ECB for that matter. Many of them have already issued similarly worded bitcoin warnings, cautioning the public about potential losses stemming from volatility, fraud, theft and a range of other issues.  Speaking at a bitcoin panel discussion last year, BoE chief cashier Chris Salmon described bitcoin as ""genuinely innovative,"" but he warned that it would not be the ""final word"" in digital currencies. In other words, something better could eventually replace bitcoin.  Salmon also said that it is highly unlikely that central banks will issue digital money in the next decade, but he admitted it is a possibility sometime in the future. Salmon believes digital currencies in their current form cannot replace traditional money, but they can complement it.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/13/bank-of-england-digital-currencies-are-similar-to-commodities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c6757633118a42acef8be7837ebb8da1baf3abd1-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A statement from MAS said the anonymous nature of virtual currency transactions leave them particularly vulnerable to these risks.  In response, MAS is introducing regulations requiring intermediaries that operate virtual currency exchanges and vending machines to verify the identities of their customers. They will also be required to report any suspicious transactions to the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office.  Ong Chong Tee, deputy managing director of MAS, said:  ""MAS is taking a targeted regulatory approach to virtual currencies to specifically address money laundering and terrorist financing risks. Consumers and businesses should take note of the broader risks that dealing in virtual currencies entails and should exercise the necessary caution.""  These new requirements are similar to those that already exist for money changers and remittance companies that facilitate cash transactions in the country.  Greater clarity  Antony Lewis, business development at Singapore-based bitcoin exchange itBit, said: ""We welcome regulatory clarity for bitcoin, and we applaud these steps by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.""  He went on to say itBit focuses on offering bank-level security to those trading bitcoin, comcluding:  ""As outfits which knowingly engage in questionable transactions are regulated out of the market, consumers win.""  The MAS statement highlights it does not view virtual currencies such as bitcoin as securities or legal tender and , as such, the intermediaries involved are not covered by the Securities and Futures Act and the Financial Advisers Act.  Last year, MAS warned consumers of the potential dangers of digital currencies, but followed this in December with a statement revealing it would not interfere with bitcoin adoption.  The authority said: “Whether or not businesses accept bitcoins in exchange for their goods and services is a commercial decision in which MAS does not intervene.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/13/singapore-to-regulate-bitcoin-exchanges-and-atms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/273f1a87c68c75235333aa53c7393e4d11341949-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425555,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIW2Fh,1394707903,Tech Millionaire Zhenya Tsvetnenko Brings Bitcoin to Australian Stock Exchange,"Australian investment company Macro Energy has announced plans to enter the digital currency space through the acquisition of Digital CC and its subsidiary digitalBTC. The company plans to raise A$9.1m and list digitalBTC on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).  Macro Energy  describes digitalBTC as an ""innovative digital currency company"" engaged in bitcoin mining and trading. In addition digitalBTC is developing retail consumer products for bitcoin and other digital currencies.  Strong credentials  The company points out that digitalBTC already has established mining revenues and ties with key hardware partners. It also has a trading desk backed by management experienced in physical commodities trading and is headed by Zhenya Tsvetnenko, a wealthy Perth-based tech entrepreneur.  Macro Energy said:  ""Following completion of the transaction, digitalBTC will be the first ASX-listed company offering exposure to the bitcoin system and will gain advantage from the robust corporate transparency and compliance required by the ASX listing.""  The capital raising appears to have been successful and the company says it already has ""firm commitments"" from investors. The money raised will go towards expanding bitcoin mining and trading activities, as well as development of retail-oriented mobile applications.  High hopes  Tsvetnenko has a background in tech and one of his earlier projects was a micro-transaction platform integrated with Google ads and mobile apps. He believes he can change the way many users approach payments and transfers.  Tsvetnenko said:  “As the bitcoin system matures beyond its initial niche and begins to realise its true disruptive potential, sophisticated service firms will be increasingly required to facilitate the system. We believe that sophisticated intermediaries such as digitalBTC can derive significant profit in supporting this emerging growth phase of bitcoin, as it takes its place as a true worldwide currency.""  Tsvetnenko said he is pleased with the Macro Energy deal, as it will give digitalBTC the platform and capital to take its operation to the next level. Since the company will be listed on the ASX, public market investors will have an opportunity to participate, he points out.  In addition to bitcoin, digitalBTC will also look at other emerging digital currencies, as many of them enjoy similar growth rates to bitcoin and they could complement digitalBTC's digital currency strategy.  High-quality  Macro Energy managing director Brett Lawrence said the company was on the lookout for high quality investments and digitalBTC ticked all the right boxes. He said digitalBTC offers Macro shareholders ""significant potential upside"" in a rapidly evolving sector.  ""The strong support shown by new investors, having received firm commitments exceeding $9.1m under the capital raising, underlines investor confidence in the future of the bitcoin system,"" Lawrence said.  Australia  is relatively liberal when it comes to digital currencies, the Reserve Bank of Australia does not believe that it has to step in yet, and the fact that a bitcoin company can trade on the ASX and raise plenty of funding from serious investors is an encouraging sign.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/13/tech-millionaire-zhenya-tsvetnenko-brings-bitcoin-to-australian-stock-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf16d151eebd31fc810c7b248d483103197b4aaa-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
