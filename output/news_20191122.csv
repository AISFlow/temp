42431188,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0nbh,1574458209,JPMorgan Tests Private Blockchain to Track Auto Dealer Inventory,"JPMorgan thinks a blockchain can help it keep track of the automobile inventory it finances for car dealers – and prevent them from pledging the same cars for different loans.       The bank’s wholesale car financing arm has filed a patent application describing a distributed ledger-based version of floorplan lending, a revolving line of credit that allows car dealers to borrow against retail inventory.       Every car sold in the U.S. has an individual vehicle identity number (VIN). The bank reckons that these can be anchored to a blockchain, assisted by a range of other telematic and geolocation sensors, which can remove inefficient manual pain points around auditing inventory on the dealership floor.       “The floorplan lending process involves periodically doing a physical inspection or audit of all the inventory on the dealership's lot,"" said Kevin Point, head of research and development at Chase Auto. ""That means that a human being actually travels to the dealership, identifies the vehicles and then reconciles that inventory, if the loan's outstanding, on both the dealer's and the bank's accounting system.”       Banks like JPMorgan, which have been busy testing and heads-down building blockchain systems for the last several years, are now clearly looking for practical opportunities that will see their bottom line improved by the tech.      About 17 million new cars are sold each year in the U.S, said Point, and when you add in used vehicles there are many millions sitting on floorplan lines of credit. Tracking them on a distributed ledger “will achieve cost savings over time. We believe these could be significant on an industry-wide basis,” he said.       The move is a slight departure for the Quorum blockchain, a private variant of ethereum developed by JPM. Previously, Quorum was used solely for abstract financial operations, issuing debt or linking payment networks of correspondent banks and such like. By contrast, the new Chase Network of Assets involves verifying physical objects.      Christine Moy, blockchain lead at JPMorgan, described it as a pilot in that it’s being tested with real dealership partners, but not in production yet. She also said Network of Assets could be applied more broadly, adding that JPMorgan is speaking to automakers about the blockchain system, but was not at liberty to say which ones at this time.       “Not only is JPMorgan and Chase Auto seeking to solve its own problem, basically it will benefit the vehicular and equipment industry at large,"" Moy said. ""The Network of Assets is the foundation for this particular application and use case, but can also be the foundational piece for many other value-added applications and services for auto manufacturers, other banks and finance companies, and dealerships, related to devices with telematics connectivity.""       As well as allowing much more in the way of real-time risk management, the DLT system is designed to prevent a practice known as “double flooring.""       ""This is when accidentally (or fraudulently) a dealership may pledge one vehicle as collateral for one floorplan contract to one bank, but also pledge the same collateral for another floorplan contract with another bank,"" Moy said.       JPMorgan's idea is not entirely novel. For instance, Tata Consultancy Services, part of the Indian multinational group, has also been looking at blockchain for floorplan financing.       However, JPMorgan’s Quorum efforts are well established with a vibrant community around the tech, and it also provides the potential interoperability with tokenized payment systems such as the bank's embryonic JPMCoin in a next-generation blockchain world.      For now, wholesale auto financing is a solid start, said Point.       “Because of the unique identifiers, telematics, the auto industry and its counterparties are a great way to get adoption out there quickly and that will drive efficiencies into different areas of finance,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | WALLET | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/22/jpmorgan-tests-private-blockchain-to-track-auto-dealer-inventory,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7033ce55aa0ca766a3e79fb724b82ec276145464-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The official announcement came one week after CoinDesk reported a leaked notice that detailed an inspection plan for crypto-trading operations in each district of Shanghai.      “If investors see activities and operations related to virtual currencies in any form, they can report to authorities,” the bank said in today’s announcement, stressing the distinction between blockchain technologies and virtual currencies.      The bank, joined by other local financial authorities, including the Shanghai Internet Finance Rectification Agency, plans to monitor crypto-related activities continuously and “nip the small and early-stage businesses in the bud” to protect investors.      Investors should also report any individual or organization that uses foreign services to trade virtual currencies or launch initial coin offerings (ICOs), the bank said.      The bank also listed some of the most common “fraught” crypto activities ranging from initial futures offerings, initial exchange offerings, initial mainnet offerings, security token offerings and ICOs.      In the previously leaked notice, the regulators in each district of the city were required to search and inspect crypto exchange related services before Nov. 22, or ICOs via a blockchain.      “Promotional and brokerage services inside China for ICO projects that are registered outside of the country also fall under the inspection scope of the local financial regulators,” the notice said.      China’s central bank rolled out a nationwide crackdown on crypto trading and ICOs for the first time in September 2017, fearing cryptocurrencies would disrupt its financial market.

42431193,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0nth,1574446243,Jury Convicts Crypto Ponzi Scheme OneCoin's Lawyer on Fraud Charges,"Mark Scott, the lawyer behind Ruja Ignatova’s OneCoin, was found guilty of laundering $400 million for the Ponzi scheme on Thursday.      OneCoin has been called a “pyramid scheme” and “multi-level marketing” ploy by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, who have aggressively pressed charges against the international operation they say generated in excess of €3.5 billion ($3.7 billion) in sales revenue. The verdict adds another name to the growing list of convicted OneCoin officials.      Scott was convicted of washing a sizable portion of that haul. He was found guilty Thursday with laundering $400 million starting in 2016. He now faces potentially up to 50 years in prison, as well as disbarment.      The money flowed through an elaborate network of fraudulent private equity investment funds and between international tax havens, from the British Virgin Islands to Ireland, to the Cayman Islands, that obfuscated their source, according to the press release.      In the process, Scott skimmed off $50 million for himself.      “He lined his pockets with over $50 million of the money stolen from victims of the OneCoin scheme,” U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement. “Scott, who boasted of earning ‘50 by 50’ now faces 50 years in prison for his crimes.”      Scott’s conviction in the Southern District of New York comes just over a year after his arrest, and on the heels of last week’s news that Konstantin Ignatov, another high-ranking OneCoin official and Ruja Ignatova’s brother, had reached a plea deal with prosecutors.      Regulators and investigators around the world have derided OneCoin as a blatant scam, with warnings and prosecutions coming out of Africa, Europe, Asia and North America. Chinese authorities alone prosecuted at least 98 OneCoin individuals since September 2017.      OneCoin still operates out of its founder Ruja Ignatova’s home country Bulgaria.      The Department of Justice has issued an arrest warrant for Ruja Ignatova. The OneCoin founder has not been seen since her disappearance in 2017.

42431181,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0nRh,1574441446,HODLers Are 'In the Money' Despite Bitcoin's Drop to Six-Month Lows,"A majority of bitcoin holders are making money on their investments despite the cryptocurrency’s drop to six-month lows.      The top cryptocurrency fell to $6,968 during European trading hours Friday – the lowest level in six months, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Currently, the cryptocurrency is changing hands around $7,100, a 48 percent drop from highs above $13,800 seen in June.      Despite the sharp drop, 15.31 million or 54 percent of bitcoin addresses are still “in the money,” according to blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock.      An address is said to be ""in the money"" if the current price of bitcoin is higher than the average price at which coins were acquired or sent to an address.      The on-chain metric, therefore, indicates the majority of holders have acquired coins below the current price of $7,100.      A closer look at the chart above shared by IntoTheBlock's CTO Jesus Rodriguez shows most of the in-the-money addresses have purchased bitcoins in the range of $900 to $4,180. A significant number of addresses appear to have purchased at an average cost in the $4,180-$6,631 range.      After all, BTC has traded above $10,000 for only nine months in its lifetime. Further, the cryptocurrency broke above $6,600 in October 2017 – eight years after its creation.      Hence, it's no surprise that the majority of addresses are still able to sell at a gain. A few of them may have acquired coins during the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 when the cryptocurrency was trading in the range of $4,180-$6,631.      The chart also shows that 1.03 million addresses have acquired bitcoins in the range of $6,631 to $7,354. With prices trading near $7,000, a few of them are already out of the money, meaning they would take a loss if they sold now. If the sell-off continues, these addresses may panic and attempt to liquidate their bitcoins, leading to a deeper drop.      That said, BTC is currently far from capitulation – the point of time when investors attempt to exit an investment or market so quickly that they are willing to surrender any and all gains to do so. The panic selling ends up exaggerating the price drop and is widely considered the final stage of a bear market.      This is due to the fact that the average cost of most in-the-money addresses is below $4,100, as noted above. These addresses would become at-the-money and may start offering bitcoins in the event prices drop below $4,100 over the coming months.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/22/hodlers-are-in-the-money-despite-bitcoins-drop-to-six-month-lows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0d557e87b0a9c1dc1eb73a5b07459183058749b4-1772x1284.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431191,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0nlh,1574427789,Mnuchin's Number Two Says Private Cryptos Pose Threat to Government Power and Will Be Watched,"Justin Muzinich, the deputy secretary of the U.S. Treasury, has raised the specter of a not-so-distant future when private digital currencies have stripped some of the power from governments when it comes to monetary policy.      In a keynote address at The Clearing House + Bank Policy Institute Annual Conference in New York on Thursday, Muzinich gave an over view of the Treasury's current priorities, from regulatory and tax reform to economic policy and national security.      He also devoted a good third of his talk to the digital currency space and the growing trend for financial intermediation by non-bank companies.      Cryptocurrency projects, said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's number two, ""not only have implications for private business, but also for a number of activities the government is responsible for. ""      There are a number of potential threats from the rise of the technology, he said, including to national security, the monetary base, financial stability and consumer protections and privacy.      The Treasury has concerns that digital currencies ""can potentially be used to evade existing legal frameworks – like those governing taxation, anti-money laundering, and countering the financing of terrorism,"" Muzinich said. While the treasury has set out that U.S. laws must be obeyed, regardless of whether a transaction is made with fiat or digital currency, should an anonymous cryptocurrency grow to scale it would make it harder to enforce those laws.      Even if crypto projects comply with all anti-money laundering rules, there's still a threat to financial stability and user protection, but looming above all that, a ""longer-term concern,"" is the issue of governance, said Muzinich.      While he didn't mention it specifically, the Facebook-led Libra project would seem to have raised the issue foremost in the Treasury's thinking. The project – a stablecoin pegged to fiat currencies that would be made available to Facebook's billions of users and beyond – has been widely criticized by regulators worldwide over its perceived threat to financial stability, national monetary sovereignty and crime management.      Raising the history of the U.S. monetary system, Muzinich continued to say that in the 1830s, 90 percent of money circulating was from private entities. ""The U.S. enacted laws to charter national banks to create a uniform currency; a central bank to provide a flexible and stable monetary system: and federal deposit insurance. Together these form key foundations of our financial system,"" he said.      Cryptocurrency, therefore, raises questions under this system. If one grew to be used on a large scale, who would make the big decisions on any important changes? What if a majority of the cryptocurrency was owned outside the U.S.?      ""In any case, would important decisions about our economic system have been taken out of the hands of representatives accountable to the people?"" he further asked.      Private cryptocurrencies are not just about payments, according to Muzinich, but may move ""some functions traditionally performed by government to the private sector.""      Finishing with a warning to the digital currency industry, the deputy secretary said that policymakers ""in pursuing the public interest, will take a very hard look at these issues.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/11/22/mnuchins-number-two-says-private-cryptos-pose-threat-to-government-power-and-will-be-watched,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c75e9986055449ee7dc2c8c2043324e72ca28ca-1500x996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431186,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0ndh,1574422800,What a Schwab-TD Ameritrade Merger Would Mean for Crypto,"Update (Nov. 26, 01:30 UTC): Schwab has officially announced a deal to buy TD Ameritrade for $26 billion in stock, confirming last week's press reports.      An acquisition of TD Ameritrade by Charles Schwab would change the landscape of the traditional brokerage industry – and it may have implications for the ongoing mainstreaming of cryptocurrency trading.       The companies are reportedly in talks, and while a deal is by no means confirmed, it would marry one of the few mainstream financial companies to embrace the crypto market with one whose stance is less clear.      Nebraska-based TD Ameritrade has been allowing clients to trade bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) since 2018. Moreover, it owns a stake in ErisX, a bitcoin spot and futures exchange that may allow ethereum and litecoin futures trading as well.      Speaking at CoinDesk’s Consensus in May 2019, the brokerage’s executive vice president Steven Quirk said there is high demand for digital assets among retail investors across different ages and registered investment advisors.      “We get calls, emails, 60,000 clients have traded something in this complex,” Quirk said.      Schwab, on the other hand, has not leaned in to crypto quite as much. The San Francisco-based firm did enable clients with futures accounts to trade Cboe Bitcoin Futures (XBT) on the StreetSmart Central or StreetSmart Mobile trading platforms as far back as April 2018, according to a statement from the firm. Cboe later phased out the product, however.      Also, one of Schwab’s directors, Chris Dodds, also sits on the board of crypto exchange powerhouse Coinbase.      However, as recently as September, Schwab pointedly said it had no plans to offer direct trading of cryptocurrencies, with a spokesman telling brokerage industry publication RIABiz: “Investors should view these currencies as a purely speculative instrument.”      CEO Walt Bettinger – who would remain at the top of the potential merged company, according to news reports – is known for being cautious, which also suggests the firm would remain standoffish about crypto.      “Schwab, similar to Vanguard, tends to be more conservative in their general approach,” said Kostya Etus, a portfolio manager at money management firm CLS Investments.      “They are more methodical in launching new products and evaluating new initiatives, having a longer term view and outlook, because they don’t want to abandon something that doesn’t work,” he said. “Another way to put it is that they are very cost-conscious.”    Fearless Fidelity    Neither TD Ameritrade nor Schwab has gone as far as Fidelity Investments, a close second to Schwab in traditional brokerage services, which earlier this year launched a crypto brokerage and custodian for institutional clients, Fidelity Digital Assets.      “Fidelity can be more experimental with crypto services than Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade since it is privately held and more free of shareholders’ opinion over new investments than the other two public companies,” said Samuel Lee, a financial advisor at SVRN Asset Management.      If Schwab were to take over TD Ameritrade, the combined company could hold more than $5 trillion in assets with 20 million clients, compared to Fidelity’s nearly $8 trillion with some 30 million clients.      Merging them could increase the scale of their businesses and further reduce transaction fees to boost their position as two of the most cost-effective brokerage services providers in the industry, said Jeff Tjornehoj, director of Fund Insights at Broadridge, a U.S.-based financial services company.      “But it is still too early to tell how exactly the two firms would benefit from the deal,” Tjornehoj said.      And the same goes for how it would affect their limited involvement in crypto, though part of the allure for Schwab may be TD Ameritrade’s tech savvy.      “TD Ameritrade is a technologically advanced investment firm,” Lee said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/22/what-a-schwab-td-ameritrade-merger-would-mean-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/462d38bcb4f14c6340b5acf0813fad621c7489c9-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431184,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0nZh,1574420400,"Bitcoin Price Dips to Six-Month Low of $7,000","View  Bitcoin’s price has briefly dropped to $7,000 – its lowest level since May.  Next losses may extend to falling channel support at $6,800, with a weekly chart indicator reporting the strongest bearish bias since March.  Intraday charts are reporting oversold conditions. As a result, consolidation or a minor bounce to $7,500 could be seen before a deeper drop.  A break above $8,231 is needed to invalidate lower highs setup and confirm a short-term bullish reversal. The outlook as per the weekly chart would turn bullish once the RSI has moved above 53.00.    Bitcoin’s price dropped to a six-month low on Friday, with a widely tracked technical indicator reporting the strongest bearish bias in eight months.      The number one cryptocurrency by market value fell to $7,009 on Bitstamp at 10:05 UTC – the lowest level since May 17 – erasing the entire rally from $7,293 to $10,350 in October, plus some.      At press time, BTC has bounced back slightly and is trading at $7,220, down 8 percent on a 24-hour basis.      The downtrend looks sustainable, as the weekly relative strength index (RSI) – an indicator used to confirm market trends and overbought and oversold conditions – has declined to 43.00, the lowest reading since mid-March. A reading below 50 indicates bearish conditions. So, it seems safe to say the market sentiment is extremely bearish.    Weekly chart    The RSI is holding well below 50 and pointing south (above left), confirming the bearish trend in the market. The MACD histogram is also printing deeper bars below the zero line, indicating a strengthening of bearish momentum.      The cryptocurrency is trapped in a falling channel (above right), represented by the trendlines connecting June and August highs and July and September lows.      As a result, a further drop to the channel support at $6,800 cannot be ruled out. That said, a minor bounce to $7,700–$7,800 may be seen first, according to the intraday charts.    Hourly and 4-hour chart    The RSI on the hourly chart is producing higher lows as opposed to lower lows on the price chart – bullish divergence suggesting sellers may be running out of steam. The RSI on the 4-hour chart is hovering well below 30, indicating oversold conditions.    8-hour chart    The series of lower highs and lower lows seen above indicates the bears are in control. The immediate outlook would turn bullish only if and when prices invalidate the lower highs setup with a move above $8,231.      Overall, the outlook as per the weekly chart will remain bearish as long as the RSI is held below 53.00 and the price is trapped in a falling channel.      Note that as per textbook rules, RSI’s move above 50 implies a bullish reversal. In this case, however, 53.00 is the demarcation line between the bulls and the bears.      This is due to the fact that the indicator consistently bounced up from 53.00 levels throughout the 2016-17 bull market. That level was breached in early January 2018 following which BTC fell to $6,000 on Feb. 6.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/22/bitcoin-price-dips-to-six-month-low-of-7000,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0d948e20f28380ba6dd33421b028d1180d079f1c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a blog post on Thursday, ICE said the Bakkt Bitcoin Cash Settled Monthly Futures contracts will be listed on ICE Futures Singapore and cleared by ICE Clear Singapore – both regulated by the island-state's de facto central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).      The cash-settled contracts will be settled against prices of Bakkt's physically delivered bitcoin futures contracts, launched in the U.S. in late September. The contracts are sized at one bitcoin and settled in U.S. dollars.      “Our new cash settled futures contract will offer investors in Asia and around the world a convenient, capital efficient way to gain or hedge exposure in bitcoin markets,” said Lucas Schmeddes, president and COO of ICE Futures and Clear Singapore.      Bakkt said as recently as CoinDesk's Invest: NY event earlier this month that it planned to offer cash-settled futures in Singapore.      The ICE subsidiary also revealed on Oct. 24 that it would “launch the first regulated options contract for bitcoin futures,” also on Dec. 9, and expanded its bitcoin custody offering beyond futures clients to wider institutional clients on Nov. 11. Galaxy Digital became one of the first clients this week, tapping Bakkt and Fidelity Digital Assets to store the bitcoin for two new funds.

42431178,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0nLh,1574413500,Fidelity Digital Assets to Sign Up Its First Crypto Exchange by End of the Year,"Fidelity Digital Assets (FDAS), the young cryptocurrency trading business of a financial-services powerhouse, expects to sign its first exchange by the end of the year, according to its president Tom Jessop.      As a brokerage, FDAS helps institutional investors get the best deal buying or selling bitcoin from various sources. So far, those have all been over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks.      “Between launching our trading platform five months ago to year-end, we will have more than doubled the number of liquidity providers,” Jessop told CoinDesk, declining to say exactly how many that would be. “We are primarily focused on OTC liquidity providers. It's likely we will connect to our first exchange perhaps before year-end.”      The move would likely give FDAS access to a broader market and liquidity for smaller trades. OTC desks primarily trade with larger institutions and high-roller “whale” investors, whereas exchanges serve retail traders and smaller institutions.      ""An exchange has more small order activity and is more comprehensive than an OTC desk which may rely more on relationship driven activity and is mostly used for larger block trades,"" said John Todaro, director of research at Tradeblock, a provider of institutional trading tools.      FDAS, a unit of Fidelity Investments, is one of several firms attempting to bridge Wall Street with the wild world of crypto, along with Bakkt, the bitcoin futures market launched this year by Intercontinental Exchange.      It's a bold challenge. For example, OTC desks have been easier to bring on board than exchanges, FDAS has found.      “We apply a very high standard of counterparty evaluation, involving a rigorous risk management and onboarding process,” said a spokeswoman. “This approach is something we’ve been able to apply to OTC desks with post-trade settlement more readily than working with an exchange”    Plans for 2020    Earlier this week, FDAS won a trust charter from New York’s Department of Financial Services. The charter allows FDAS to onboard New York clients and gives the firm more credibility with clients that are fiduciaries looking for a custodian with a trust license.      While Jessop wouldn’t name the New York clients that FDAS is onboarding, Galaxy Digital recently announced that it was using FDAS and Bakkt to custody its two new bitcoin funds. Other New York clients will be onboarded in the next five to six weeks, Jessop said.      FDAS has a diverse client base, including hedge funds, family offices, an investment advisor and a small, U.S.-based pension fund, Jessop said. “The interest in that [pension fund] segment is there.”      “We’ve been surprised over the course of the year about the level of interest and amount of work people have done to understand the asset class,” he said.      After FDAS has onboarded New York clients, it plans in the new year to begin onboarding new assets, developing its trading capabilities, scaling its business and pursuing licenses in other states where it is not currently doing business.      As a privately held company, Fidelity has been able to experiment with innovative technology without worrying about short-term payoffs. An R&D division, the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology (FCAT), has studied the crypto space closely, even mining bitcoin.      FCAT recently completed a proof-of-concept with security token facilitator Tokensoft, according to a Medium post by Tokensoft Head of Operations Lawson Baker      Bits and Blocks Club, an FCAT internal learning group focused on digital assets and blockchain, launched a restricted ERC-1404 token on ethereum which “Fidelity employees used … in a closed-loop rewards system designed to encourage employees to attend internal events and other activities.”      ""From [European] banks to innovation labs at financial institutions like Fidelity's, TokenSoft is seeing traction up-market for institutional customers for security tokens and other financial assets,"" Baker wrote in an email.

42383036,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tkkz,1574396155,"Algorand 2.0's New Non-Turing-Complete Smart Contracts Are a Feature, Not a Bug","Proof-of-stake blockchain Algorand now supports smart contracts.      The Algorand Foundation released an update to the blockchain’s protocol on Thursday, adding decentralized finance (DeFi) features plus the long-awaited smart contracts. “Algorand 2.0” is the largest expansion of the network’s capabilities since the network’s launch in June 2019.      “With this release, new features and simple developer resources enable new use cases and broader adoption of blockchain overall,” Algorand CEO Steve Kokinos said in a statement.      For months Algorand employees have been hinting at the pending development. It’s the first time Algorand has supported smart contracts, the code-driven contracts that can track and execute the terms of formal agreements over time.      Algorand’s ASC smart contracts have back-end differences from the smart contracts pioneered by blockchains like ethereum. That’s because Algorand’s new in-house programming language Transaction Execution Approval Language (TEAL), is non-Turing-complete.    Technically unique    Turing completeness is a measure of a programming language's ability to simulate another programming language and possibly manipulate its own programming instructions.      Nearly all modern programming languages are Turing-complete, but Algorand touts TEAL’s difference as a feature, not a bug. TEAL smart contracts are safer to write and execute, despite having more limited potential functionality, Algorand argues.      For example, ASC cannot support recursive logic, according to the developer page.      “We don’t believe that turing-complete is necessary for the majority of the use cases,” said Paul Riegle, head of product at Algorand. “It adds immense attack surface and a potentially steep performance impact.”      Simpler functionality could mean better security – or, at least, a more straightforward path to ensuring ASC contract coders do not inadvertently lose assets. It is easier and faster to check a smart contract code for errors when its programming language excludes recursive logic, according to Hacker Noon.    Other upgrades    The standard asset issuance (ASA) function brings widespread tokenization features to Algorand, and is also a baseline DeFi tool.      The foundation’s developer page said any asset can be digitized and stored on-chain with ASA.      Algorand also introduced batch transaction functionality with the Atomic Transfers feature released Thursday.      With the new tool, users can perform complex token transfers – such as circular trades and internal account settlements – in one transaction, the developer page said.      The foundation said that Algorand 2.0 does not impact Algorand’s sharia compliance certification, with other key features remaining unchanged.      Algorand has a market capitalization of $108 million, according to Nomics, and ranks as the 48th-largest blockchain, according to CoinMarketCap.",POSITIVE,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/11/22/algorand-20s-new-non-turing-complete-smart-contracts-are-a-feature-not-a-bug,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/764cf8d5c706cc5f4c598a134b8cd8417079b8d3-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
