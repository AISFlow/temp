42400976,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLWLd,1517439645,NEM Foundation: Stolen Coincheck Funds Not Sent to Exchanges,"The 58 billion yen worth of XEM tokens are on the move, according to the NEM Foundation, but no attempt to sell them on exchanges has been made as of Wednesday.  Some 500 million XEM were stolen from Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck last week in what some observers have called the largest exchange hack to date. However, despite reports to the contrary, those behind the attack have not yet tried to sell them, according to a statement released by the Foundation Wednesday morning.  ""None of the stolen funds have been sent to any exchanges. As long as those funds are off public exchanges they will be very difficult to liquidate, especially in large amounts,"" the group stated.  Reuters had previously reported that NEM Foundation vice-president Jeff McDonald had said the hacker or hackers had started trying to move the stolen tokens to six different exchanges in order to sell them.  However, this information was not entirely accurate, NEM Europe promoter Paul Rieger asserted. In an email to CoinDesk, the NEM Foundation subsidiary member said:  ""There were eleven 100 XEM transactions from one of the hacker accounts to “random” accounts. Nothing was sold. There were also no attempted transactions to exchanges.""  Rieger had previously told CoinDesk that his group was tagging accounts containing stolen XEM. His team also helped develop a system to automatically flag any stolen XEM, as well as the accounts they appeared on.  On Wednesday, The Japan News reported that the stolen XEM was transferred to 20 different accounts over the course of five days, with a series of transfers on both Jan. 26 (Friday) and Jan. 30 (Tuesday). The newspaper further stated that the Metropolitan Police Department was investigating these transfers as a possible attempt at slowing the investigation into the actual hack.  The Japan News further claimed that nine different accounts each received at least 11,000 yen.  It is unclear where The Japan news received its information from. The NEM Foundation declined to confirm the report's claims.  In its statement, the NEM Foundation noted that it would be difficult for the hacker to liquidate most of the stolen XEM, and the token's developers were continuing to monitor the accounts regardless.  Though news of the theft did not have a major impact on XEM's price, news that Coincheck would reimburse its investors for their stolen funds sent the coin's price to a local high of $1.22. However, it has since begun dropping again, falling to about $0.76 as of press time amidst a wider crypto bear market.

The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs will meet on Feb 6. at 10 a.m. EST, with SEC chief Jay Clayton and CFTC chief J. Christopher Giancarlo set to appear as witnesses. The hearing and the appearances by Clayton and Giancarlo were previously reported by the Washington-based publication The Hill earlier this month.  The hearing – entitled ""Virtual Currencies: The Oversight Role of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission"" – comes amid a period of heightened activity at both agencies around the topic.  The SEC has filed a number of lawsuits in recent weeks against allegedly fraudulent initial coin offerings (ICOs), while, as reported yesterday, the CFTC has moved to scrutinize the activities of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and Tether, the closely-linked company behind the controversial USDT token.  Next week's hearing notably follows the publication of a joint op-ed from Clayton and Giancarlo. The article, published by the Wall Street Journal, served as both a pledge to apply closer oversight of the industry as well as a warning to some – particularly those soliciting investments.  ""Market participants, including lawyers, trading venues and financial services firms, should be aware that we are disturbed by many examples of form being elevated over substance, with form-based arguments depriving investors of mandatory protections,"" the two wrote.

42400979,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLWQY,1517427017,KodakCoin Token Sale Delayed By 'Several Weeks',"The initial coin offering (ICO) for the Kodak-branded cryptocurrency, dubbed KodakCoin, has been delayed.  The public sale was originally supposed to launch on Jan. 31, as previously reported by CoinDesk, following a pre-sale during which 8 million KodakCoins were sold.  Per the statement, the delay is being attributed to an extended process of verifying that those trying to invest are actually accredited in the U.S., meaning that they have a net worth of more than $1 million or an income of at least $200,000.  The statement continued:  ""Given the large interest in the KODAKCoin ICO and the steps that we need to take to verify the 'accredited investor' status of each interested investor, we expect this process to take several weeks.""  The project is the result of a deal between Kodak and WENN Digital, and is intended to serve as the underlying token for a decentralized photo rights management platform (and as pointed out by Ars Techina, the project appears to be traced to an earlier, similarly-structured project called RYDE coin).  Kodak's pivot to blockchain led to rumors that the company was trying to take advantage of the current investor atmosphere around other firms, many of which have seen their stocks double or triple after announcing pivots related to the tech. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said last week that it plans to scrutinize such moves more closely.  Market data shows that, in the wake of the delay announcement, Eastman Kodak Co. share prices have fallen. Per Google, the stock's value is down more than 15% as of press time.  The Jan. 31 statement also warned investors against fake KodakCoin ICO pages appearing on Facebook and other websites, and that investors would not be able to purchase tokens outside the company's official platform.

Speaking during an event at the Polytechnic University of Milan that was organized by energy giant Enel (which itself has trialed blockchain for energy trading purposes), Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan joined the growing chorus of government officials who have decried the price developments around cryptocurrencies in recent months.  ""The oversight authorities are ever more active and the central banks are weighing whether to use cryptocurrencies but then, if the phenomenon explodes, they can do harm,"" Padoan remarked, according to a report from Ansa Business.  The publication also quoted Padoan as saying that the issue isn't strictly technological, but rather a consequence of how it's used.  ""Blockchain is a technology and technology is one thing, and the use you make of it is another,"" he told event attendees. ""The problem is not the technology but the behavior"".  Speculation around cryptocurrencies has caught the attention of Italian regulators in the past, including its tax office, which in late 2016 moved to treat bitcoin as a kind of currency for tax purposes.  Market watchdogs have also targeted local promoters of the OneCoin investment scheme, which has been widely accused of being a Ponzi scheme, ultimately issuing a 2.59 million euro fine last August.

Signing the petro white paper on Tuesday, Maduro stated that the initial sale of the token will commence on Feb. 20th. President Maduro also revealed that plans are being drawn up to use the petro – which is backed by commodity reserves, including oil – with a national ID card possessed by millions of Venezuelans, a Bloomberg report states.  Maduro further announced that mining centers are being setup at educational institutions to produce the token. This apprently has been revised from an initial draft proposal that the petro was supposed to be pre-mined before launch.  Maduro stated on state TV, according to Bloomberg:  ""The petro will have a great impact, in how we access foreign currencies for the country and in how we obtain goods and services that we need from around the world.""  The controversial token was announced back in December of last year, with the declared aim of bypassing financial sanctions.  The country's opposition-run congress soon after declared that petro is ""illegal"" and that it would be effectively borrowing against the country's oil reserves. As such, the move would violate laws that specify the legislature must approve government borrowing.  ""This is not a cryptocurrency, this is a forward sale of Venezuelan oil,"" said legislator Jorge Millan at the time, calling it ""tailor-made for corruption.""  Additionally, on Jan. 22, U.S. Senators Marco Rubio and Robert Menendez denounced Venezuela's planned cryptocurrency in an open letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  The two senators wanted to know how the department would move to prevent the country from using the petro to bypass U.S. sanctions.  They wrote:  ""It is imperative that the U.S. Treasury Department is equipped with tools and enforcement mechanisms to combat the use of cryptocurrency to evade U.S. sanctions in general, and in this case in particular.""

The order – granted by Chief District Judge Joseph McKinley, Jr. at the U.S. District Court, Western District of Kentucky – requires the parties to disclose cryptocurrency wallet and trading account addresses, as well as the identities of anyone to whom BitConnect has sent digital currencies within the last 90 days.  The defendants have 10 days to comply with the order. In addition to the disclosures, BitConnect International PLC, BitConnect LTD, BitConnect Trading LTD and Ryan Maasen are prohibited from transferring any assets they may possess until they are granted permission by the court, according to the TRO.  The order comes in response to a second class action lawsuit filed against BitConnect after it shut down its trading and lending platform, alleging that the exchange is a Ponzi scheme.  The plaintiff, Kentucky resident Brian Paige, filed the lawsuit on behalf of every investor in BitConnect, noting that bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets had been converted into BitConnect Coin (BCC) when the company announced it was shutting down its exchange. BCC, which was trading at more than $300 at the time, had crashed to about $6 at press time.  The court found that the plaintiffs stood to lose any chance of recovering their funds if BitConnect's assets were not frozen, and that enforcing a TRO ""is in the public interest because the public is interested in preventing massive consumer fraud and other securities violations.""  The lawsuit continued:  ""This temporary restraining order is being entered without notice to Defendants to preserve the status quo and prevent irreparable harm until such time as the Court may hold a hearing.""  Due to the nature of the lawsuit and alleged securities violations, the court also noted that the plaintiff ""has shown a strong likelihood of success,"" and that the TRO ""would present the status quo and give the Court the ability to make a meaningful ruling on the merits of this case.""

42400984,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLWTV,1517409935,Bull Breakout? LSK Jumps 60 Percent on Exchange Listing,"The price of Lisk's native token LSK is flirting with a bullish breakout following a new exchange listing.  Price charts indicate LSK ran into bids at $21.63 at 05:34 UTC today before ultimately jumping more than 60 percent to $35.26 in the next 30 minutes. So far, it's a development the investor community is associating with its listing on the Japan-based exchange bitFlyer, one that holds water as it's one of the largest domestic exchanges in terms of trading volume.  However, bitFlyer encountered technical difficulties immediately after the new listing.  This seems to have weighed over LSK prices. As of writing, LSK is changing hands at $26.27, meaning the cryptocurrency has retracted from its intraday high of $35.26.  Still, the odds of a bullish breakout on technical charts remain high.  Prices could remain well bid in February as a project relaunch is scheduled on Feb. 20, and it seems to have garnered plenty attention from investors.  The company runs a blockchain application platform, somewhat similar to ethereum in intent in that it's meant to enable decentralized applications. It is also set to unveil an entirely updated and improved platform, as well as a new brand identity and website next month.  LSK chart  The above chart (prices as per Bittrex) shows:  A repeated failure on the part of the bears to keep prices below the 50-day MA, followed by a sharp rebound from the rising trendline representing a series of higher lows. The price action indicates the bulls are in control.  The 50-day MA is trending north, indicating a bullish setup.  The relative strength index (RSI) is above 50.00 (in the bullish territory) and on the rise, suggesting scope for further gains in LSK.  View  The retreat from the intraday high of $36.27 has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook.  That said, a close today (as per UTC) above $26.68 (Jan. 20 high) would open doors for a sustained move higher to a record high of $41.39 (set on Jan. 7).  On the downside, only a daily close (as per UTC) below $14.76 (Jan. 17 low) would signal a bullish-to-bearish trend change.

Bittrex chief executive Bill Shihara had already provided some details of the exchange’s decision-making process during a panel at CES 2018, saying the company looks at whether a token is innovative, the team that developed it and its compliance with various legal statutes.  A document provided exclusively to CoinDesk (see below), further breaks down the procedures followed by the exchange, starting with a preliminary review that requires groups to submit both logistical information about the token and identifying information about at least one of the developers behind the project.  Tokens that make it to the full review must complete a compliance procedure to ensure they can be listed within the U.S. After the compliance review is completed, a committee of Bittrex members will look at the blockchain's features, use cases, market interest and the team behind the token, among other characteristics.  Shihara expanded:  ""We have to have confidence that as things are breaking that these guys are actually able to fix it and sometimes fix this stuff on the fly. So, you know having a great engineering team and great leadership team matters significantly in the listing process.""  Bittrex also outlined a partial list (see bottom) of reasons a token may be taken off its exchange, ranging from regulatory non-compliance to poor handling by the team operating the coin.

42400978,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLWOa,1517405416,State Retirement Funds in Tennessee Could Face Bitcoin Restriction,"Tennessee lawmakers have put forward a new bill that would bar state government retirement funds from investing in cryptocurrencies.  Introduced on Jan. 30 and sponsored by Representative Michael Curcio, the House bill, if enacted, would amend the existing Tennessee Code Title 8 that relates to post-employment benefits for public officers and employees.  According to the latest Tennessee Code, trustees are assigned from members of the state's Department of Finance and Administration, as well as the Senate and the House of Representatives, to oversee investment plans for the schemes.  While the trustees are granted powers to invest in financial instruments in which the Tennessee retirement system has permission to invest, the new bill seeks to exclude cryptocurrency from those options.  ""Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the trustees shall not invest in any cryptocurrency,"" states the proposed bill. It goes on to request that the act would take effect as soon as it becomes law.  The proposal, perhaps, signals that lawmakers in Tennessee are becoming wary of investments associated with cryptocurrencies given the market's high volatility.  Yet the opposite stance is being taken by another legislative action that is eyeing a role for cryptocurrency's underlying blockchain technology.  As reported previously, Tennessee joined Florida and Nebraska in January in filing a new bill that aims to recognizes blockchain signatures as legal electronic records.

42400980,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLWRX,1517403951,Davos Elites Still Don't Get Blockchain,"Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.      Every year at the World Economic Forum, a handful of timely, hot-button issues overshadow the myriad other topics consuming the chatter of the attending businessmen, government officials, development professionals, celebrities, journalists and multiple other breeds of wannabe ""Davos men.""  This year, as with last, a guy called Trump was on everyone's mind. But that was hardly unexpected.  What was truly remarkable, at least for anyone who has been interested in blockchain technology since its relative obscurity only a few years ago, was the degree to which it became one of the uber-themes of #WEF2018.  In the wake of last year's huge price surge for bitcoin, ether and many other digital tokens, and amid high-profile media coverage of the ""crypto boom,"" everyone wanted to know what all the fuss was about.  The newly curious trudged through piles of fresh snow to the various ""blockchain lounges"" set up outside the security perimeter of the main conference by outfits such as the Global Business Blockchain Council and ConsenSys.  There, they were served valuable insights into how this technology works but also, perhaps, a realization that blockchain technology's promises of decentralized record-sharing and disintermediated trust have sweeping implications for everything from payments, international development and financial markets to the Internet of Things, energy, environmental management and identity.  But while light bulbs went off in some people's heads, there were equally strong signs in the lead-up to and during the World Economic Forum that these concepts are still far from wide acceptance among the broad financial, economic and political establishment.  The many recent instances of people from the economic powers-that-be dismissing this technology’s relevance and over-emphasizing its risks over its potential are a reminder that those of us who believe in it still have work to do to get these influential people into the comfort zone.  Krugman's myopia  In an interview with Bloomberg in Davos  , U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said she was looking ""very seriously"" at taking action against cryptocurrencies ""precisely because of the way they are used, particularly by criminals."" In South Korea that same week, the government announced new rules requiring cryptocurrency traders to identify themselves.  But what struck me most was a pre-Davos tweet storm by Paul Krugman, one of a triumvirate of high-profile Nobel laureate economists who've been highly critical of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, the others being Joseph Stiglitz and Robert Shiller.  Responding to what I thought was a very enlightening cover piece in The New York Times Magazine, Krugman laid out what he thought the technology was all about and then came to this conclusion:    So the blockchain in interesting, but not yet clear whether it's useful for anything. And investing in Bitcoin still looks a lot less reasonable than investing in cold fusion 12/        — Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) January 21, 2018      Predictably, the crypto community immediately dismissed the economist as an ignorant dinosaur. The favorite put-down was to remind him of his now notorious 1998 prediction that the “Internet's impact on the economy [would be] no greater than the fax machine's.""  Let's make one thing clear: Paul Krugman is no idiot. Let's forego the ad hominem. I think it's more constructive to think about the ingrained mindset of otherwise intelligent mainstream economists that leads people like him to misunderstand the new social structures created by open-source communities, distributed consensus models and programmable tokenized incentive systems.  Krugman and his cohort are trapped by a rigid worldview, one that remains entrenched within the economics fraternity, despite the crisis of 2008, which painfully revealed the deep flaws of the profession's quasi-scientific models of ""rational"" human behavior.  When it comes to understanding the value proposition of blockchain technology and drawing conclusions that ""it's not useful for anything,"" the biggest problem of this blinkered mindset is that it fails to recognize the cost of trust.  Let me explain what I mean by that, because I think it's key to getting skeptics to see why these ideas are so important. A few of us in the crypto community started playing with this logic in Davos. See if it works for you.  Hidden cost of trust  First, Krugman is right to say that expensive mining and the need to retain multiple copies of the same transaction record across distributed networks are ""clunky"" and ""costly"" aspects of blockchain technology. One answer to that is to say that innovations such as the Lightning Network will eventually fix the problem, but I think the better rejoinder is: ""Compared to what?""  The ""what"" in this case is defined as the explicit and implicit costs that organizations pay to resolve shortfalls of trust. It turns out that that the cost of trust, which is passed onto consumers via higher prices and access restrictions, is very high indeed.  I don't have a dollar number for it, but just think about the world's skyscrapers, each filled with accountants doing endless checks and audits of other companies' invoices, purchase orders and financial reports, and you get the idea.  They're all trying to reconcile across each other's separate, centralized ledgers, and all because they don't trust each other's records. That's a cost of trust.  The cost of trust can also be conceived of via the old adage about electricity blackouts: that the highest cost of energy is the energy you can't access. There are all sorts of potentially enriching transactions that we aren't able to conduct because we can't resolve the trust problem.  We can't yet do peer-to-peer microtransactions between devices on the internet of things, for example, without passing them through some gatekeeping institution, be it a bank or a major cloud-service company like Google or Amazon. That not only adds costs and friction, it also constrains innovation.  And if you step outside the bubble of the developed world and consider the pervasive financial exclusion of the developing world, the cost of trust for 2 billion ""unbanked"" is especially high. (This is where Krugman is at his most myopic. Unable to leave the developed-world bubble, he claims that the only reason you would want to conduct electronic transactions in cryptocurrencies rather than via a bank account or some other third-party-trusted tool such as a debit card or PayPal is if ""you're buying drugs, assassinations, etc."")  The perfect moment?  But the developed world is not at all immune from trust shortfalls.  The results of public relations firm Edelman's ""Trust Barometer,"" which were released during the World Economic Forum, were scary, at least for Americans.  This annual survey showed that trust in the U.S. among the general population plunged 9 points, the largest-ever fall in the survey's history, and by 23 points for the so-called ""informed public"" to post the lowest level of all 28 countries surveyed, below even Russia and South Africa.  As for what this means, let's go to Breitbart, which many liberal Americans might argue is partly responsible for this breakdown.  It cited the PR firm's CEO, Richard Edelman, as saying that the main factor behind the drop in trust was that ""we lack common facts and have a fundamental difference of interpretation of facts.""  Common facts requires a common record of truth. I know a technology that can help with that....

42400986,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLWUU,1517400006,Bitcoin Back Above $10K But Gains Could Be Short-Lived,"Bitcoin is back above $10,000, but the gains could be short-lived, the price charts indicate.  Having breached key support yesterday, prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) fell to a two-week low of $9,627.89 at 01:14 UTC today. In the last few hours, bitcoin (BTC) has managed to regain some poise and moved back above $10,000. At time of writing, bitcoin was around the $10,300 mark.  The 15 percent drop from the weekend high of $11,942.25 signals a continuation of the series of lower highs on the price chart, suggesting the bears remain in control.  That said, the quick rebound from $9,627.89 to $10,000 adds credence to the argument that the cryptocurrency could be forming a base around $10,000.  However, the 4.9 percent rally from the intraday low of $9,627 looks like a technical correction amid a bigger downtrend. Further, a break below $9,780 could result in sharp losses.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  BTC closed (as per UTC) yesterday below $10,313 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low-high), signaling another victory for the bears. However, they have failed at least four times in the last two weeks to keep the prices below the key Fibonacci level, thus establishing it as an important support level.  A falling channel marked by falling trendlines representing lower highs and lower lows.  Five-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA are trending lower, indicating a bearish setup.  The 50-day MA has adopted bearish bias (is beginning to slope downwards).  Also, the bearish move below $10,313 witnessed yesterday looks strong.  4-hour chart  So, the cryptocurrency looks set to test $8,052 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low - high) over the next few days.  However, the above scenario may not come to fruition if the rising trendline continues to cap downside in bitcoin.  Trendline chart  View  The previous day's close below $10,313 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low-high) has strengthened the bears.  However, the rebound from the trendline support seen today calls for caution.  A daily close (as per UTC) below the trendline support of $9,780 could yield a drop to $8,052 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low to high).  Bullish scenario: A daily close (as per UTC) above $11,690 would turn the tables in favor of the bulls.

The news was reported by South Korean news outlet The Bell yesterday, citing unnamed Samsung officials as its source.  Samsung was slated to start mass producing the chips – called application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) – this month, for distribution by the Chinese firm, it adds.  Rumors of Samsung's ventures in mining date back to last October when the company unveiled a bitcoin mining rig composed of old Android smartphones at a U.S. developer's conference.  The reports have been somewhat contradictory, and it is unclear if the company has multiple partnerships in the works. In December, The Investor – another South Korean news outlet – reported that Samsung had partnered with a Russian bitcoin mining company called Baikal to produce ASICs, the production of which was also set to commence in January.  Samsung's shift toward manufacturing processors for the crypto mining industry marks an expansion of its existing chip products, which reportedly accounted for more than 60 percent of its 2017 operating revenue.  If confirmed, the company's involvement in mining will offer serious competition to the existing industry leader, China-based Bitmain, which claims to hold over 70 percent of the market share.  Users on Twitter were quick to point out that the sheer size of Samsung's semiconductor plant would give the firm an automatic advantage.

Rather than follow China's lead and take the drastic step of closing down domestic exchanges, the minister added:  ""Regulating exchanges is [the government]'s immediate task.""  Kim's comments come after the country has moved to increase scrutiny of cryptocurrency trading, to calm what it considers an overheated market.

Further, authorities said people not complying with the change face penalties.  Amid the government's moves to quell the market, statements from some officials had indicated that the country might be planning to ban cryptocurrency exchanges altogether – news that was linked to a sudden drop in the prices of many cryptocurrencies. South Korea is one the the world's biggest markets for trading bitcoin and other digital currencies.

42400965,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLWDl,1517387444,Investing in the Next 'It' Blockchain Isn't So Easy,"Turns out too much money can be a bad thing.  Speaking at the Blockchain Connect conference in San Francisco last week, investors struck a surprisingly nervous note on the recent wave of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and the eye-popping funding rounds they've secured.  In fact, while ICOs and token-based blockchains have been touted as a way to circumvent the often tricky venture capital process, speakers like Linda Xie, managing director of crypto hedge fund Scalar Capital, went so far as to advocate for the industry and its decades-old approach to best practices.  Xie told the audience:  ""It's great that these ICOs allow thousands of people to invest in the project … but thousands of people aren’t going to give you the best advice on how to run this protocol or company.""  Speaking to more than 1,000 crypto enthusiasts and entrepreneurs, Xie argued traditional VCs aren't interested in just giving startups money to build their platforms. Rather, she argued they're just as focused on helping the entrepreneurs build a successful business from start to finish.  And with that, Xie and others worry about the entrepreneurs that raise exorbitant amounts of money in token sales – more money than they may ever need.  Echoing that skepticism was Rodolfo Gonzalez, a partner at Foundation Capital, who said, ""It's pretty obvious why folks are skeptical – 140 lines of code for $140 million raised; that wouldn't happen in the traditional venture world.""  There's no doubt that kind of raise will lead to failures, failures that Gonzalez said would make investors, both institutional and retail, demand better management of the crypto projects they put money towards.  And while that hasn't shaken out just yet, the investors on the panel had some ideas of what that transparency in management might look like in the future.  Is this legit?  Others chimed in with words of warning as well. Take Huobi Capital, which thought everything was on the up with one of the startups it invested in through a token sale not long ago.  The venture arm of the cryptocurrency exchange Huobi is focused on a buy-and-hold strategy for projects that it thinks might become the next ""it"" blockchain, and the team believed this startup had potential.  Yet, shortly after closing the ICO, the founders of the company resigned, taking a good chunk of change with them and leaving the project in limbo.  ""We had to liquidate,"" Li Huo, head of Huobi Capital, said.  And that's why the company now looks to invest primarily in token projects that instate some sort of lockup process for the tokens they raise.  ""We get a better deal because [the token] doesn't go onto the secondary market for speculators … and it shows that [the founders] are interested in working on the project longer term,"" Huo said.  Xie agreed, explaining that Scalar also looks for longer-term lockups because the company is interested in investing in companies over three to five years.  She said:  ""Even if there's a liquidity event, we'll hold.""  Continuing, Xie said she is interested in seeing more token projects develop a method for raising money in installments, like the traditional venture rounds, instead of raising a ton of money all at once. Plus, vesting periods for making tokens available to employees of the startup would also make institutional investors feel more secure.  A 'beautiful' business model  Having discussed all that, though, Huo admitted that liquidating the company's position in the failed token it backed had its advantages.  In the traditional venture capital space it's much harder because the positions aren't that liquid, he said, but in crypto, investors can easily sell tokens on the secondary market.  Gonzalez echoed that, calling the current business model for VCs investing in token sales ""beautiful.""  ""You get in with discounts, then when it goes on the secondary market you've already made money,"" he said. ""If you can get into the presale of many of these things, you will get rewarded well.""  And while Gonzalez seemed very much the capitalist on the panel in this regard, he wondered what another crypto ""winter,"" where the hype dies down and the industry stagnates, will bring in terms of exit strategies for both the token issuers themselves and the hedge funds investing in them.  Overall, Gonzalez said, the real strategy was getting in at the earliest position possible and going along for the ride.  Changing agreements  But Gonzalez admitted investors could get mixed up in crooked deals with this approach.  And from that, Kavita Gupta, founding managing partner at ConsenSys Capital, said she believes token issuers shouldn't be offering discounted periods with only very small lockups.  Not only that, but she and her team at ConsenSys are ""completely against SAFT"" now, a comment that refers to the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens framework.  Created by startup Protocol Labs and U.S. law firm Cooley, the living document was an effort to keep token issuers and their tokens away from the purview of the securities regulators, who are increasingly taking an interest in how these products resemble securities.  But instead, Gupta believes the Brooklyn Project, an initiative led by blockchain startup ConsenSys, will create a new framework for token issuers that is based on set deliverables, yet keeps with the ethos of ICOs that anyone and everyone can invest.  ConsenSys Capital has invested in three token projects.  And while Gupta said those investments were made based on stringent due diligence of the core concept and the founding team, she said there's no standard to making the correct crypto token investment currently.  ""I don't have a very optimistic answer,"" she said.  Hot topics  Yet, many of the investors on the panel did give some insight into what kinds of things they're looking for before investing in a token project and what are concepts they're researching heavily.  Xie said she asks three questions before moving forward with an investment – ""Is this something that anyone would want to use? Does this actually need to be decentralized? Does this token actually make sense or can you replace the token with a more liquid coin like bitcoin or ether?""  She continued, saying that all the more traditional mechanisms are vetted too, such as the supply of tokens, the inflation rate, the community interested in the project, what percentage of tokens is being held by the founders and the governance structure. Plus, Xie's co-founder is a developer who analyzes the codebases.  And in doing their research on the nascent crypto token space, what several investors have found most intriguing are protocol tokens, privacy tokens and decentralized exchange projects.  Both Xie and Huo mentioned decentralized exchange projects, which many in the industry believe are the way forward in stopping large repositories of customer information from catching the eye of hackers.  Aligning with this interest in securing people using crypto, Xie also mentioned privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies (projects like zcash and monero), which are getting quite a bit of attention of late as the technology used in those projects attracts developers from the top two cryptocurrency projects – bitcoin and ethereum.  In a separate fireside chat, Todd Chaffee, a general partner at IVP, which just recently invested in Coinbase, said the venture fund is looking for the core protocols that all other crypto applications will ride on in the future – similar to the underlying infrastructure of the internet itself.  All in all, though, Xie said she expects there to be some amount of ""ICO burnout"" in 2018.  The rampant pace of ICOs ""is going to continue, but these projects are going to have to differentiate. They're going to maybe have a platform or product already,"" she said, adding:  ""Many of these [entrepreneurs] this year will realize they don't need a token and go the more traditional equity route.""

Released  on Jan. 31 by the Korea Customs Service (KCS), the statement alleges that a total of 637.5 billion won worth (or around $600 million) in foreign currencies have been exchanged illegally, including unrecorded capital outflow using cryptocurrencies.  The investigation is part of a broader effort across South Korean authorities to examine cryptocurrency-related activities. It also comes just days after the country's financial watchdog formally banned anonymous cryptocurrency trading accounts, which took effect on Jan. 30.  While the KCS did not give any name of entities that were accused of illegal currency exchange using cryptos, it outlined methods that are commonly adopted based on its investigation.  In one case, which also accounts for majority of the alleged amount, the KCS said unregistered currency exchanges remitted 472.3 billion Korean won ($443,962,000) for customers between South Korea and Australia from March to December last year – transactions facilitated by cryptocurrencies.  While the KCS did not disclose whether it is taking any legal actions currently against these businesses, it said it will continue the effort in investigating on similar activities as well as illicit use of cryptocurrency in money laundering and smuggling illegal goods such as drugs.

42400969,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLWHh,1517382008,Hawaiian Bills Would Capture Crypto Under Money Transmission Law,"Two bills introduced in the Hawaiian Senate last week are aiming to define and include virtual currencies within domain of the state's Money Transmitters Act.  If passed, HI SB2853 and HI SB3082 would require those seeking to transmit virtual currencies in the state to have a license to do so. They would also mandate that these persons or businesses issue a warning to consumers prior to enabling such transactions.  However, the legislation notably exempts exchanges from section 489D-8 of the Act, which mandates money transmitters maintain cash reserves equal to the virtual currency funds held for clients. Hawaii's Division of Financial Institutions previously indicated it planned to leave the requirement intact, prompting U.S. exchange Coinbase to terminate its services in the state.  Still, while including a carve-out, HI SB3082 further features a warning that cautions against the volatility of cryptocurrencies, and emphasizes that they are not backed or insured by any government or commodities.  It reads:  ""You should be aware that there is a potential for you as a consumer to lose all of your virtual currency. Though cash can also be lost, with virtual currency this loss can occur because of a computer failure; malicious software attack; an attack, closure or disappearance of a virtual currency exchange company; lack of security; loss of your private key; or a sudden or dramatic change in value.""  Both bills come on the heels of the state's adoption of the Uniform Regulation of Virtual Currency Businesses Act, a proposed model legislation published in 2017 as a guide for states seeking to enact policies and provisions relating to the technology.

42400968,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLWEk,1517374855,"I Don't Hate Cryptocurrency, But...","Jason Calacanis is an angel investor in 150 startups including Uber, robinhood, Abra, thumbtack, Wealthfront and Talla. He's also the author of ANGEL.      ""If you are right, that 90 percent of crypto projects are scams or incompetent, what do you gain by taking that position publicly?"" asked a close friend.  I took a moment to think it through.  Why was I sounding the alarm on Twitter, my podcast and CNBC that civilians should be very careful investing in cryptocurrencies that are unregulated, anonymous, easily manipulated, phenomenally hackable, global and often run by bad actors or the incompetent?  ""To protect people from losing their money?"" I answered.  I've got a complicated relationship with crypto, having monitored early projects like bitcoin with enthusiasm.  Six years ago, I wrote a piece called ""The Most Dangerous Project We’ve Ever Seen,"" that introduced many in the investment community to bitcoin.  Full disclosure: While I don't trade cryptocurrencies, I have a lot of exposure to it by investments in startups like Robinhood, Abra, and Talla.com (to name a few notable projects).  Here are five important points I would like to state for the record:  This will end badly for most  It would take me 10 articles to catalogue all the risks and scams in this emerging space, but to give you the broad strokes here are the critical issues that most savvy people — including those with large positions in crypto — all agree on.  Billions of dollars in crypto have already been stolen, and most of the initial coin offerings ICOs I see are horrible ideas run by people who have no track record or ability to execute.  Bitconnect  is an instructive example. Most importantly, you should watch this hilarious video:  And read about these pump-and-dump chat rooms, where thousands of people (it seems) are buying crypto coins before marketing them to the next group of suckers.  Now, it is possible that while most projects fail, most of the money in crypto could wind up going to a smaller number of higher quality projects that become long-term successes — but that is obviously not guaranteed.  In fact, it's possible that bitcoin could go to zero (which I talk about below).  ICOs are insanely speculative  ICOs, or initial coin offerings, are the black eye of the crypto industry for a number of reasons.  Most of them have untested teams, and that doesn’t mean that those teams won’t eventually build very successful companies, but it does mean that investors (or, rather, donors) are taking serious risks.  When you look at an ICO, understand that there are multiple levels of significant risks stacked on top of each other.  Most ICOs share most of these risks:  Untested teams — some are scam artists, others are just wildly naive.  Top projects are raising far too much money before they hit any milestones — overfunding is a very dangerous thing.  A large number of bad or derivative ideas with crypto slapped on them (""Uber with tokens!"" and ""a decentralized Twitter!"").  You’re not buying stock in these companies, you’re buying tokens or, even worse, tokens that might show up, some day (i.e., the SAFT: ""a simple agreement for future tokens."")  You're investing in a white paper, which is a fancy way of saying, ""a bunch of ideas described in a PDF.""  There is little legal framework for these offerings, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is a very serious organization — and they have started to sound the alarm.  You have zero rights with your tokens — because they’re not equity!  If you compare this stack of risks to a startup, here is what I do for a living in terms of taking risk:  We typically invest in startups when they have built their minimum viable product or a product in market with some early traction (as opposed to white papers, which are typically no more sophisticated than the back-of-a-napkin idea).  We get equity in the companies (as opposed to Chuck E. Cheese tokens that have never even been actually used).  We have protective provisions in our investor agreements that keep us from being diluted, give us information rights, pro-rata, anti-dilution and other important legal concepts that keep bad actors from absconding with our money.  We have five decades of legal and regulatory stress testing of the system.  We meet with the founders of these projects multiple times and do due diligence (as opposed to zapping bitcoins to their wallets).  Now, I'm not saying I will never buy tokens, but it's very clear to me that tokens are most often either a Kickstarter contribution (you know, without the product being sent two years late), a donation, a gift to incompetent people, or a scam.  There are probably 10 percent — a guess on my part — of these projects that are going to see the light of day and have a similar chance of success as an angel investment.  So, of that small number maybe 10 percent to 20 percent will succeed.  This leads me to believe that 98 percent of these projects will result in people losing their money. That means you have to make about 50x your money on one of 50 token purchases to break even.  That might happen; I had a 3,000x+ investment, and a handful of 20-50x investments as an angel investor.  Bitcoin itself could go to zero  The bitcoin HODL crowd (a play on words for ""hold,"" as in hold your coins, never sell or spend them) think this claim is insane, but we've watched many times as the early projects in a promising vertical go to zero and the 10th goes to the moon.  Many of us used AskJeeves, Lycos, and LookSmart before Google showed up in 1998. Many of us used SixDegrees, Friendster, LiveJournal, and MySpace before Facebook in 2004.  Bitcoin is facing massive challenges around speed of transactions, the size of the blockchain, transaction costs and governance.  That last issue could be the thing that takes it down. If you want to jump down that rabbit hole, you can watch this video:  The majority case in my mind is that bitcoin will, as the first technology out of the gate, be supplanted by a much better technology. This could be a fork of bitcoin or simply a new, much better product.  As time moves on, consumers get savvier, and that means they recognize a better product quicker and move to it faster and faster. We've seen this with people jumping from Hotmail to Gmail, BlackBerries to iPhones, and dialup to broadband internet.  Consumers will not have the loyalty to bitcoin that they have to their email account and BlackBerries, because they don’t actually use bitcoin for anything other than speculation. The switching cost will be zero, as opposed to switching your phone, which requires backing up your data, moving your phone number, and setting up your new iPhone and selling your BlackBerry.  We could see a run on bitcoin that happens in days or hours, not years like the decline of RIM (BlackBerry's parent company) and AOL.  There will be an Amazon and Google in crypto  I'm guessing we will see an Amazon, Google or Netflix-like company come out of the crypto space. When we do, there will be a ten-year window to buy their stock and be rewarded.  As such, if you are in love with the crypto space, my advice to you is:  Spend 50 percent of your time learning.  Invest no more than 5 percent of your net worth in a basket of projects.  Be prepared to lose 100 percent of your investment in this basket of projects.  If you do hit a massive winner, say a 50x investment, make sure to sell some along the way as ""idiot insurance.""  That last part is the critical one. I've had to have a heart-to-heart with a number of friends who bought bitcoin early and who are ""crypto rich and cash poor.""  If 90 percent of your wealth is in any one currency that is a very bad idea — unless you control that currency, i.e., if you were Jeff Bezos, owning a lot of Amazon stock isn’t a huge problem because you control the company and have massive insight into it.  Founders, beware ICOs  If you take people's money for a token that you hope will someday have utility, understand that the person buying it believes — 99 percent of the time — that this is a security.  If people buy your token to make money it is no longer a utility token, even if those buyers signed a document that says, ""I’m buying a utility token not a security.""  Why? Because some percentage of our legal system and regulators will side with retail investors. You will get dragged into court and be forced to explain why you did a countdown clock to sell your utility tokens and why you hired promoters to sell them around the world.  Even if you win, it will be a horrible victory. Just ask the people who were sued after the dotcom implosion. It took the brutal part of a decade for most the them to clear their names even if they were in the right — others got lifetime bans.  Also, as Rob May from Talla points out, there can be additional costs to ICOs that founders might not consider.  Summary  I don’t hate crypto, but I do hate seeing people get scammed out of their money.  The space is now driven by scams, FOMO, and FOCO (fear of cashing out.), which means it’s going to end very badly for a lot of people.  Feel free to invest a lot of your time, if so inclined, but be very careful with your money.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Abra.

A spokesperson for Huobi confirmed that the company is building a new headquarters in the Silicon Valley area, characterizing the push as a fast-paced one. The rep did not offer any further details on the office's purpose.

The U.S. office would mark another leg in Huobi's bid to expand internationally. Last month, Huobi announced it was partnering with the investment company SBI Group to launch a pair of cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan in order to offer yen-based services.  SBI Virtual Currencies and Huobi Japan have not announced any firm timelines for their respective launches but were confirmed in a cooperation agreement signed by Huobi chairman Li Lin and SBI Group chairman Beiwei Kitao.
