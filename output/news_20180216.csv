It said that through ""direction finding techniques,"" the FCC Enforcement Bureau determined that the Antminer S5 mining product in his residence was the source of the ""spurious emissions"" of radiation.  The notice made clear that Rosario could face penalties if he keeps operating the bitcoin miner.  The agency warned:  ""Continued operation of this device that causes harmful interference after your receipt of this warning constitutes a violation of the Federal laws cited above and could subject the operator to severe penalties, including, but not limited to, substantial monetary fines, in rem arrest action to seize the offending radio equipment, and criminal sanctions including imprisonment.""  Rosario has twenty days to respond to the notice, which inquires as to whether he is still using the device, and requires him to provide details regarding the make, manufacture and purchase details of the Antminer.

Not Anytime Soon, Says White House Official","A White House official said Friday that legislation around cryptocurrencies is unlikely to materialize anytime soon.  Speaking with CNBC at the Munich Security Conference, White House cybersecurity coordinator and special assistant to the president Rob Royce offered the dour assessment amidst a recent flurry of discussion on cryptocurrency regulation, which is playing out between Senate hearings, enforcement actions and public op-eds.  ""I think we're still absolutely studying and understanding what the good ideas and bad ideas in that space are. So I don't think it's close,"" Joyce told the network.  Echoing previous comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Joyce said that his more immediate concern was with the criminal usage of bitcoin. He emphasized that he considered the irreversibility of bitcoin transactions – a characteristic of the how the network functions – to be troubling.  ""We are worried. There are benefits to the bitcoin concept – digital cash, digital currencies,"" he said. ""But at the same time, if you look at the way bitcoin works after there is a criminal act that takes place, you can't rewind the clock and take back that currency.""  ""We haven't figured that out yet,"" he added, ""so it's a problem.""  One U.S. Treasury official called on the international community to help take action against cybersecurity threats in a speech earlier this week, and asserted that a globally coordinated effort is the only way to prevent ""rogue regimes"" and terrorists from exploiting the pseudonymity bitcoin provides to engage in illicit activities.  World leaders largely concur on this point, including Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), who said in a recent interview that the IMF is actively trying to prevent unlawful use of cryptocurrency and supports internationally-coordinated regulation.

""Nobody understands it.""    If you want to know what bitcoin is, I learned about it.

""Now it's adorable...and you want to pick it up and pet it. But you can't because it's not there, it doesn't exist except for on that internet right there, just like bitcoin is digital currency,"" she said.  DeGeneres added that she'd opt for the goat over bitcoin if given the choice, and said of investors:  ""You'll either be a millionaire or you'll be totally broke.""  The comedian also poked fun at digital wallets, zeroing in on their vulnerabilities, while noting that they sounded like a Jimmy Kimmel stunt.  ""The digital wallet can either be apps on your phone, or tiny hard drives – which is a really good idea because who wouldn't feel safe with their life savings on a piece of plastic that could go into the washing machine,"" she quipped.  And while the bitcoin bit may be brushed off by some as a cheap gag, DeGeneres' segment is perhaps reflective of how bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have taken on greater prevalence in the mainstream consciousness.  Other celebrities have helped to spur this along in recent years, with some making the news for their investments in bitcoin – like rapper 50 Cent – and others who have endorsed ICOs or decided to accept bitcoin as payment for their products and performances.

In a press release published today, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) said there has been a sharp rise in the number of ICOs launching in Switzerland, resulting spike in inquiries about the regulations that apply to them.  With the situation currently ""partly unclear,"" the new guidelines have been released to clarify the status of projects wishing to launch a token sale project within the country.  ""Creating transparency at this time is important given the dynamic market and the high level of demand,"" the authority states.  Notably, FINMA will determine the applicability of regulation to crypto tokens on a case-by-case basis, taking a similar stance to that of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in guidance released last July.  When assessing ICOs, FINMA said it will focus on the ""economic function and purpose of the tokens,"" with the ""underlying purpose of the tokens and whether they are already tradeable or transferable"" being primary factors in how they will be classified.  The agency outlined three categories of tokens – while acknowledging that hybrids are possible – and set out the likely regulatory stance for each as follows. These include ""payment tokens,"" ""utility tokens"" and ""asset tokens,"" the latter of which would land in the securities category.  ""FINMA regards asset tokens as securities, which means that there are securities law requirements for trading in such tokens, as well as civil law requirements under the Swiss Code of Obligations,"" the regulator said.  While conceding that blockchain technology has ""innovative potential within and far beyond the financial markets,"" FINMA CEO Mark Branson said in the release that ICO projects held ""analogously to regulated activities cannot simply circumvent the tried and tested regulatory framework.""  The Swiss watchdog first said it was investigating initial coin offerings to determine whether they were following banking and securities laws in September 2017.

42380366,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NCnz,1518795944,"$10K Again for Bitcoin, But Other Cryptos Outperform","The crypto markets continued to mount a recovery this week, brushing aside fears of a possible lull ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday.  At the close of the seven-day session, the total value of all cryptocurrencies is being reported at $471 billion by data source CoinMarketCap, up 22.65 percent from $384 billion seen last Friday. During this period, the market capitalization was up 39 percent from the Feb. 6 low of $276 billion.  But while headlines may be dominated by bitcoin's move above $10,000 again, the world's first cryptocurrency isn't actually the biggest gainer of the week.  Despite its 13.54 percent rise in prices, other large-cap cryptocurrencies (defined as those with over $1 billion in market cap), are perhaps most contributing to what could end up being a recovery from the market's weak January performance.  Top performers  Litecoin  Litecoin  (LTC) has been on a tear this week, though the cause may be a matter of perspective.  While some cited its two-year high against bitcoin (something that likely spurred some buying among committed bulls), there was also the lure of free funds from a coming fork.  As profiled by CoinDesk, the announcement of an unaffiliated project called ""litecoin cash"" has boosted demand for the cryptocurrency, though experts say those expecting the resulting tokens to be as valuable as bitcoin cash may want to think again.  Ethereum Classic  The price of ETC, the native currency of the ethereum classic blockchain, also jumped this week, to $35.90 on Bitfinex – its highest level since Jan. 21.  Also worth noting is that ETC has gained 135 percent from Feb. 6 low of $14.00. That said, ETC has plenty room to extend gains, according to the relative strength index (RSI).  VeChain  January's top performing currency had another good run this week.  The VEN/BTC exchange rate witnessed a bull flag breakout this week, suggesting holders of the cryptocurrency will likely have a good time in the near future.  The blockchain will be rebranding VeChain (VEN) into VeChain Thor (VET/THOR) this month, and that seems to have generated interest in the cryptocurrency.  Bottom performers  Bitcoin Gold  There's no love lost between investor community and bitcoin gold, as the cryptocurrency created via a fork of bitcoin in mid-November fell 40 percent in January.  Prices rallied (possibly due to oversold conditions) 12.98 percent last week, but the gains were transient.  As of writing, bitcoin gold is down 70 percent from the record highs above $480.  NEM  NEM's XEM token wasn't been able to put on a good show this week, but it' up 40 percent from the Feb. 6 low of $0.397361.  On Hitbtc, XEM is threatening to drop below $0.51327 – 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July low to January high. Such a move could open doors for a further decline in prices.  Nano (Raiblocks)  Raiblocks, rebranded as Nano this year, fell amid the broader market recovery.

The regulator announced that the trade of securities for the companies – Cherubim Investments, Inc., PDX Partners, Inc., and Victura Construction Group, Inc. – will be suspended between 9:30 a.m. EST Friday and March 2. The suspension notice was dated Feb. 15.  The agency explained:  ""The SEC’s trading suspension orders state that recent press releases issued by CHIT, PDXP and VICT claimed that the companies acquired AAA-rated assets from a subsidiary of a private equity investor in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, among other things. According to the SEC order regarding CHIT, it also announced the execution of a financing commitment to launch an initial coin offering.""  A release published by the agency cites additional reasons for the suspensions. In the case of Cherubim, the trading halt came as a result of ""its delinquency in filing annual and quarterly reports.""  The suspensions represent the latest move by the agency to halt trading of companies that have publicly stated some kind of pivot or business focus on the technology. In at least one case, the public suspension followed a significant run-up in the price of a stock in light of those remarks.  In August, the agency issued a warning to investors about the risk of pump-and-dump schemes that use statements about initial coin offerings (ICOs) in order to drive market action.

42380340,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NCSb,1518786325,Silent No More: Ethereum Users Spurn Recovery Code,"The ethereum community has broken its silence over a move to better facilitate the return of funds lost on the platform.  In wake of the departure of ethereum developer Yoichi Hirai, who resigned from his role supervising the software's changes Thursday, community members have stormed Github in resounding rejection of the controversial proposal over which he left his post.  In the last 24 hours, over 80 comments have been posted to the blockchain network's official GitHub, with most stating they ""do not support” or are ""strongly opposed"" to ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) 867, which details a method to standardize the use of system-wide software upgrades to return funds lost on the platform.  Often occurring as a result of faulty code, fund recovery is a sensitive topic for the platform, having previously led to the development of a rival cryptocurrency named ethereum classic.  The heated response, in which many are coming forward to express support for the developer, marks a sharp contrast to the silence earlier in the week, with some even writing that the proposal is a ""complete disgrace to the ethereum community.""  Speaking on the thread, developer William Entriken warned about the potential consequences of normalizing lost fund recovery in comments that showcased the emerging sentiment.  ""Here's the unintended consequence of having a readily available, well documented, and standardized tool like this available,” he wrote.  Others dismissed the proposal as ""very damaging"" as well as ""scary, and an absolute joke,"" while another wrote that it ""goes against everything I thought this movement was for.""  The outrage also mirrors reaction observed in a core developer meeting last week, where ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir spoke of the necessity for community feedback on the matter, stating that EIP 867 was perhaps too important to undergo the usual EIP process.  Adding to the issue is that confusion has emerged over the status of the proposal, which was formally entered into GitHub, first as an ""issue"" (or an early-stage sketch), and later as a ""pull request,"" a formal software outline that code become merged with the platform's live code.  James Levy from Tap Trust, one of the three developers leading the proposal, closed the Github issue in the midst of the activity last night, sparking confusion that EIP 867 is no longer active.  However, to date, the corresponding pull request remains open, and at press time, continues to generate feedback.

As of writing, bitcoin cash (BCH) is trading at $1,500, as per data source Coinmarketcap. The world's fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has appreciated by 11 percent in the last 24 hours, making it the biggest gainer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies.  The sharp recovery from the Feb. 6 low of $764 is pretty much in line with the uptick seen in the broader markets in the last 10 days. That said, BCH has outperformed other crypto market leaders over that period, except for litecoin, which is up close to 110 percent from Feb. 6 lows.  The rally is backed by good news on the fundamentals front. For instance, decentralized marketplace OpenBazaar and crypto payments firm BitPay have both added support for BCH in recent weeks.  That said, BCH bulls need to overcome a couple of critical resistance levels before claiming victory over the bears.  4-hour chart  Daily chart  View  A daily close (as per UTC) above $1,756 would signal an upside break of the falling channel, adding credence to inverse head-and-shoulders breakout (seen in the 4-hour chart), and could yield a sustained rally to $2,000.

42428564,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL90th,1518779453,Japan's Finance Watchdog to Inspect 15 Unlicensed Crypto Exchanges,"The Japanese government said today that inspections will take place at 15 unlicensed cryptocurrency exchanges in light of a recent major hack.  According to the Japan Times, the country's financial services minister Taro Aso said at a news briefing that on-site inspections will take place at the exchange providers that have filed for licenses but have not yet been approved.  The move comes after the Coincheck exchange lost NEM tokens worth $533 million at the time in a major breach in late January.  The minister indicated the inspections will examine the exchanges' technical safety procedures and management of users' funds, the report indicates.  The country's financial watchdog, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), had previously ordered all the licensed and unlicensed exchanges in the country to report on their security protocols and resistance to hacking in response to the Coincheck theft. The FSA has now decided that on-site inspections are required for unlicensed operators after appraising their reports.  The Japanese system for licensing exchanges came about after the country amended its payments laws recognizing cryptocurrencies as a legal payment method in April 2017.  Coincheck had not been approved by the FSA, but had been allowed to continue operating while the review process was underway.  According to a report from Nikkei, on Jan. 29, the authority ordered the exchange to launch an investigation into its security vulnerabilities that led to the hack, and to submit a report for management improvement to the authority. The FSA said at the time, ""Inappropriate management of system risks had become the norm at Coincheck.""    In separate news, the FSA earlier this week issued a warning to a foreign cryptocurrency service firm that allegedly offers unlicensed financial instruments. The move marked the first time regulators in Japan had issued a warning over a cryptocurrency services company since the country legalized bitcoin as a payment method.

Bitcoin Shows Weakness Above $10K,"Having found weak hands above the $10,200 mark in Asian hours, bitcoin has slipped back into four figures.  The cryptocurrency rose above $10,000 at 17:29 UTC yesterday, but ran into offers at $10,218 and dropped to $9,865.29 at 21:59 UTC. Another attempt to score gains above the $10,000 mark ran out of steam at a high of $10,293.44 at 02:14 UTC. As of writing, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) is seen at $9,960.  Despite the pullback from a 16-day high of $10,293.44, the cryptocurrency is still up 1.56 percent on a 24-hour basis, according to data source CoinMarketCap.  On Bifinex (the biggest exchange by volume), trading volumes surged as BTC rose above $10,000 yesterday. However, as seen in the chart below, the volumes have dropped in the subsequent hours, explaining the failure to post solid gains above $10,000.  1-hour chart (volumes)  Also, as discussed earlier this week, the weekly chart remains bearish, thus a struggle to hold above $10,000 should not come as a surprise. Further, the shorter-duration technical charts indicate scope for a further drop towards $9,000.  1-hour chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  Bearish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence, marked by higher highs on prices and lower highs, and signals the short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  Rounding top on the RSI, indicating the rally from the Feb. 11 low of $7,857.78 may have found a temporary top above $10,000.  The 1-hour 50-MA is curled up in favor of the bulls.  Strong support at $9,090 (confluence of the ascending trendline and the Feb. 10 high).  View  BTC looks could revisit $9,000 in the next few hours as suggested by the topping pattern on 1-hour chart.  Bullish scenario: A rebound from $9,000 would keep bitcoin in the hunt for $11,000 (inverse head-and-shoulders target), although only a high volume break above $11,300 would revive the bullish outlook.  Bearish scenario: A daily close (as per UTC) below $9,000 would add credence to the bearish weekly chart and the potential for a stronger retreat to $7,851 (Feb. 11 low).

Called the Ethereum Community Fund (ECF), the effort is the result of a collaboration between Cosmos, Golem, Global Brain Blockchain Labs, Maker, OmiseGo, Raiden and Tendermint, with those involved agreeing to work to connect ethereum projects with companies that could benefit from the blockchain services they offer.  It will also support the projects in the form of a grant program that will function as ""a permanent financial endowment"" for selected projects, according to a release.  Perhaps most notably, however, the fund boasts the involvement of ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, who confirmed he is an advisor in an email to CoinDesk..  ""Ethereum has grown beyond my expectations over the last few years, but the work is clearly not finished,"" Buterin said in a statement.  He continued:  ""Delivering value that matches the hype should be the mantra of 2018; efforts such as the ECF which help organize the development of the ecosystem are going to help make that possible.""  More broadly, the ECF is not the only project of late to seek to bolster the ethereum blockchain and its surrounding ecosystem.  The Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit that oversees the platform's development, announced two subsidy programs in January which will serve to incentivize developers to implement scaling solutions. Likewise, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance provides resources to businesses hoping to adopt ethereum and links Fortune 500 enterprises with startups.  As such, those involved in ECF expressed optimism their project would encourage others to join what they see as a wider effort.

42428576,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL91Ph,1518757254,"As Bitcoin Soars, So Do Coinbase Customer Complaints","It was around midnight, January 31, when K. received an email from Coinbase containing a 1099 tax form. That was strange enough – K. certainly didn't expect a cryptocurrency exchange to be a conduit for government documents.  Then K. looked at how much Coinbase said he owed money on: $2.4 million.  ""I initially freaked out, considering I've probably put in a max of $8,000 into Coinbase and somehow I may be liable for millions?"" K. said in an online chat with CoinDesk.  The next business day, K. called Coinbase customer support, only to have a representative tell him he couldn't answer the details on the phone, and to email the company instead.  Which he did, only to get a formulaic response showing the IRS guidance to Coinbase.  To this day, K says he has no idea where the $2.4 million figure came from. He says he is too busy to jump through more hoops with the largest exchange in the U.S., and that he feels safe in the knowledge that he doesn’t have to pay taxes on $2.4 million in earnings, since they don't exist.  More users, more problems  K. is far from alone in wrestling with an apparent misfire from Coinbase.  In recent weeks, complaints have been piling up on a Reddit page dedicated to the company. The issues mentioned are wide-ranging: missing wires, unreleased bitcoin, disabled accounts.  The top posts on the page over the past month look like this:  A representative for Coinbase said the company was unable to comment on the complaints.  Stepping back, as crypto values spiked during the recent run-up, several major exchanges heaved under the weight of new demand. Kraken, the third-largest exchange in the world, suffered an outage earlier this year that was supposed to take two hours but ended up lasting two days as it upgraded its system.  Bitfinex also suffered a malfunction late last year due to a denial-of-service attack.  But perhaps above all others, user growth at Coinbase has gone gangbusters. The userbase has more than doubled since 2016 to more than 10 million customers today, according to a spokesperson. The company now employs about 200 people, she said.  Service at the exchange had already begun showing signs of strain when the company announced in August it had raised $100 million, and said some of the new funding would go toward alleviating customer service pressure. Late last month, it hired a new vice president of operations and technology, Tina Bhatnager, to oversee customer support. It also appointed Dan Romero with the title of general manager of Coinbase, in a blog with the headline: ""Customer support: failure is not an option.""  But the complaints are still coming in fast and furious.  Perhaps most distressingly, a number of Coinbase users recently reported unauthorized charges to their linked bank accounts. In some cases, these charges, which duplicated previous legitimate withdrawals, completely drained customers' funds and left them owing their banks hefty overdraft fees.  And Coinbase isn't perhaps wholly to blame, issuing statements pegging the issue as one the originated with card issues like Visa, which have moved to restrict purchases in recent weeks.    ""We are working closely with Visa to ensure affected customers are being refunded as soon as possible, as well as notifying all customers that made transaction during the past few weeks that they might be impacted,"" the company said.      Still, perhaps sensing a weakness, formidable new competitors are encroaching on Coinbase’s retail turf: the stock brokerage platform Robinhood, which now has 1 million crypto users waiting to be enrolled; and Square, which now allows buying and selling bitcoin through the Square Cash app.    Squeaky wheels  For now, though, there remains the question of what to do if you're impacted.  Coinbase user Suzepo, who lives in Italy, says it took him three tries over the course of a month for his verification deposits to go through. It was apparently only after he added the name of his bank that it went through; there were apparently no instructions on Coinbase’s part that this was necessary.  He said that in his attempts to reach Coinbase, he didn't get a single response until the very end of his ordeal. While he appreciates that there was no delayed purchases, and immediate fund input, he ultimately felt frustrated by the support assistance, or lack thereof.  ""No response from the support team, customers left alone to deal with their own issues and that big [verification] transfer burden,"" he says.  Reddit user crypt_iss complained about a botched transaction in a post that was heavily upvoted on Coinbase's subreddit. As of last week, he said he has “technically withdrawn” the amount but it is still not in his Coinbase vault. Yet Coinbase shows the transaction as completed in one location and pending in another, he says.  ""No one from help desk has called, it is only email messages. If this post would not had risen to top here, even this would not had happened. I really cannot believe they have such poor handling of so many parts. Move fast and break things culture I guess,"" he said.  Sergej Kotliar, the CEO of crypto mobile phone card provider Bitrefill, told CoinDesk he had no reason to believe the users’ complaints weren't legitimate.  Making a stink on social media ""is a good way to get helped, and people who are missing tens of thousands of dollars can get pretty upset,"" he said.  Kotliar also said he doubted the complaints were being astroturfed, i.e. orchestrated by competitors to sow doubts about Coinbase.  ""Who would be their rivals? This is growing pains,"" he said. ""They really grew very big.""  Update: This article has been updated with additional comment from Coinbase.

42428565,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL911h,1518752413,'Hundreds' of Crypto Miners Said to Be Descending on Quebec,"Canadian electric utility Hydro-Quebec may raise energy rates for crypto businesses due to an influx of requests from miners hoping to take advantage of its cheap rates.  More than 100 crypto mining companies have approached Hydro-Quebec, spokesman Marc-Antoine Pouliot told CTV News Montreal, and a few have already settled in the province. Notably, Pouliot said some farms would consume more than 20x the power required for Montreal's sports and entertainment complex, The Bell Centre.  ""One project like that isn't a problem, but now we're talking hundreds,"" Pouliot was quoted as saying.  As reported by CoinDesk last month, Hydro-Quebec initially sought to attract large tech companies to the province with its low rates, but the cheap energy and cold weather – ideal for keeping mining machines cool – attracted mining companies as well.  Hydro-Quebec has a surplus of energy, which makes miners ""interesting clients,"" according to Pouliot.  However, the demand has caused the company to consider an industry-specific rate change – which in the past has only been realized in the form of discounts – to protect its surplus.  The news comes at a time when some mining hotspots are considering larger measures to manage the farms' energy consumption.  Earlier this week, an Icelandic lawmaker proposed a tax on bitcoin mining companies, citing their lack of a contribution to national tax revenue. The country has extensive geothermal energy resources, and like Quebec, offers a cold climate that mitigates the heat output of mining machines.

42428569,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL91Bh,1518744606,"No, 'Litecoin Cash' Isn't Bitcoin Cash All Over Again","""Be careful out there!""  So tweeted litecoin creator Charlie Lee in response to the launch of litecoin cash, a cryptocurrency that's expected to spin off from his project, the fifth largest cryptocurrency by total value, next weekend, taking its code and transaction history with it. Always outspoken, Lee went on to call the project a ""scam,"" warning users: ""Don't fall for it.""  His harsh comments might come as a surprise since litecoin cash's developers admit they have no ties to the official litecoin project and don't particularly see it as a competitor.  Much the same as other projects ""forking"" to create a new cryptocurrency, litecoin cash's developers claim they simply want to use an existing codebase to create a newer and better form of online exchange. Also, by changing litecoin's underlying mining algorithm to the one bitcoin uses, they argue litecoin cash will bring new life to old, abandoned mining equipment in a kind of strange recycling attempt.  But while developers claim that's the motivation, users seem mostly interested in the ""free"" money.  Already, an influx of buyers on more consumer-friendly exchanges is driving the price of litecoin to notable highs, in part because, due to the mechanics of the fork, any user who owns litecoin at the time of the fork will immediately have a portion of litecoin cash.  Bolstering this view is the name ""litecoin cash,"" an obvious reference to the successful fork bitcoin cash, the profitable project that sparked the wave of forks carrying into 2018.  And litecoin cash's lead developer Tanner, who did not give his full name, admits the project named it as such to draw more attention.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Community engagement is the key to success for any coin. I think that, 'Hey, you already own this, why not check out what we're doing?' is a good jumping off point for people.""  By doing so, Tanner told CoinDesk, litecoin cash hopes to use the free coin giveaway as a springboard to create a network faster than bitcoin, with lower transaction times.  And in this way, the two ""cash"" projects are different. While bitcoin cash rallied support from those who had a competing technical vision, litecoin cash doesn't appear to have the same strong ideological roots.  No debate  To start, bitcoin cash arguably had more on the line since it was created as the culmination of years of debate in the bitcoin community.  Last summer, bitcoin cash users and miners were effectively pioneers in the forking world – they didn't know if they would create a coin that people would actually want to use. While they didn't replace bitcoin, as the project's developers hoped, they rallied together a community, and today bitcoin cash is the fourth most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, appealing to users who support their unique technical roadmap.  Litecoin cash doesn't have a similar history or significant traction leading up to its fork. So, litecoiners like Lee doubt litecoin cash serves the same purpose, a way of settling an argument, as bitcoin cash.  Litecoin cash hasn't made any such claims either, but Lee worries that even though litecoin cash doesn't claim to be associated with litecoin, it will confuse users anyway.  Lee told CoinDesk:  ""It confuses people into thinking litecoin is splitting. The litecoin community has no interest in splitting. It's just some people trying to make a quick buck. And calling it litecoin gives them some legitimacy.""  Lee said he's witnessed no debate in the litecoin community, and that includes none over litecoin's mining algorithm, sha256, the feature litecoin cash plans to implement. ""No one wants to fork litecoin to sha256. That’s pretty stupid,"" he said.  ""Yes, I can understand that confusion. I can also understand people who are yelling 'scam,'"" Tanner said. ""I think [Lee]'s absolutely right to stick to his guns and protect his project and community. I don't expect him to change his mind about us but hope that if anything he'll eventually recognize that we're trying to teach people to be safe.""  But, some users seem not to care about safety at all.  As one user put it in the litecoin cash Telegram chat group: ""We want the fork for free coins which potentially may be real or scam.""  Forking obsession  Lee's comments are part of a larger pushback against forks.  One big reason, as he alluded to, is brand confusion. Bitcoin forks, for example, are taking the name ""bitcoin"" along with them, despite not having any association with the ""real"" or most widely-known bitcoin project.  One developer recently even suggested suing any project that takes the bitcoin name to ""mitigate confusion"" for new users. This idea proved very unpopular, but it shows a general skepticism about forks, and how developers have zero control over the situation due to the nature of open-source development.  Yet, litecoin cash argues they're using the litecoin prefix simply because it's just become common practice of late.  ""Anyone who's paid attention through the bitcoin forking period hears 'litecoin cash' and instantly understands that it's a fork of litecoin,"" Tanner said, adding, ""I can't deny it also appealed to our sense of humor to poke the wasp's nest with our naming choice.""  And it's perhaps working since litecoin cash has been able to draw a lot of recent media attention.  That said, Tanner argues the project seeks to stand out from the litecoin forks that he thinks will inevitably follow: ""There will be forks that follow us, who do seek to confuse you and do seek to scam you.""  Still, Lee remains unconvinced litecoin cash has any merits, concluding:  ""In my mind, it's just a scam and it hurts litecoin.""
