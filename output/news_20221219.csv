42388324,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREHzN,1671493312,"Kazakhstan Tightens Regulation for Miners, Looks to Develop Broader Crypto Industry","Kazakh legislators approved a bill last week that will introduce corporate tax for bitcoin miners as well as restrictions for the industry’s energy consumption nationwide.  The law, dubbed “On Regulating Digital Assets in Kazakhstan,” was one of three pieces of crypto-related legislation approved by the country’s lower house, known as the Mazhilis, last Thursday, according to the parliament website. The bill now heads to the Senate for discussion and another round of voting. The legislation came to the table only in recent months, but the central Asian nation had been struggling with power shortages since at least fall 2021.  If the Senate also approves the bill, the president has to sign it for it to become law. The Senate might vote on amendments, in which case the bill will be sent back to the Mazhilis.  Kazakhstan saw a massive influx of crypto miners from neighboring China after Beijing banned the industry in May 2021. At that time China was the world’s largest bitcoin mining hub.  It didn’t take long before Kazakhstan’s electrical grid, much of it a legacy of Soviet times, started crumbling under the new load. On top of the miners’ demand, technical failures in interconnection lines and power stations greatly exacerbated the situation, such that Kazakhstan, which until 2021 was a net power exporter, now sometimes imports energy from Russia.  Read more: Kazakhstan’s Crypto Miners Face New Regulations After Contributing to Power Shortages  Kazakhstan’s grid operator, KEGOC, cut off electricity to crypto mines in January for several months, while a campaign to crack down on illegal mining has been ongoing.  CoinDesk learned about details of the legislation from people who are involved in the discussions and in local media.  Power allocation  According to current discussions, the bill will allocate about 500 megawatts (MW) to miners. On top of that, miners that have registered with the government will only be able to buy power from the grid when there is an excess.  The guaranteed volume is small compared to Kazakhstan’s total mining industry. Officials estimate around 1,000 MW-1,200 MW of electricity is consumed by crypto miners in Kazakhstan.  The 500 MW cap is essentially a guarantee to miners that not all operations will be shut down, said Azamat Akhmetzhanov, press secretary of the Kazakhstan Association of Blockchain Technologies, a local industry group. But it simply isn’t enough – even as many miners have already left the country – said Didar Bekbau, founder of local mining firm Xive.io.  This solution might solve Kazakhstan’s energy problems and power outages, but it remains to be seen exactly how the surplus will be calculated, Akhmetzhanov said.  “Maybe the energy industry must change, because now the government regulates tariffs and doesn't create incentives for building new power generation organically,” Bekbau said.  Those that are connected to renewable energy providers may not be subject to the requirement of only buying when there is a surplus, said Bekbau.  Under the new law, miners will also only be able to buy grid power from KOREM, a state-owned enterprise that administers the day-ahead energy markets, according to local media site reports. In day-ahead markets, energy is traded for delivery within the next 24 hours of any given time. Miners will be able to buy in free market conditions on KOREM at wholesale prices, without any price restrictions or controls, local media reported.  Worsening economics  Crucially, the bill enshrines that miners have to pay corporate tax. Preferential taxation benefits that some could enjoy as high-tech firms in a special economic zone have already been withdrawn, said Akhmetzhanov and Bekbau.  President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev signed into law a tax hike for miners' electricity usage in August, which is set to take effect at the start of 2023. The bill doesn’t change this hike, but it ensures that miners pay corporate taxes and can’t use the special economic zone to avoid an increased rate.  It looks like miners will have to pay double tax, making them less competitive globally, Bekbau said, who thinks that the electricity tax should be eliminated. The blockchain association's press secretary however believes that the bill just ensures that the corporate tax will be ""calculated in more detail.""  Miners might also be forced to sell three-quarters of their mined crypto locally through government-approved exchanges, starting in 2024. For Bekbau, that is not great news for the miners.  The “liquidity problem shouldn't be solved at the expense of miners,” who should be able to choose where to sell their coins, he said.  But Akhmetzhanov thinks that it might be good news for Kazakhstan. Once the exchanges receive liquidity, “With good management and a far-sighted strategy, they will be able to enter the top 30 trading platforms in the world,” the press secretary said.  “The government wants more control and taxes,” said Bekbau, adding that the legislation could bring miners’ costs to 26 Kazakh tenge per kilowatt hour (kWh), roughly $0.055/kWh. That price is relatively competitive internationally, but in a crypto winter that has already caused the mining industry to be reeling in pain, it will likely send many miners underwater.  The law also stipulates two new licensing categories; one is for miners that own and operate infrastructure, and one for those that simply host their mining machines in facilities run by other companies, local media reported.  All in all, the new legislation might discourage investors. Already, “trust is shaken, many investors left Kazakhstan and canceled expansion plans,” Bekbau said.

Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) had spread like wildfire, leading to more than $5 billion in withdrawals from the crypto exchange. Nevertheless, Binance was able to withstand the onslaught and amid all of this, activity on the Binance Smart Chain has fallen drastically, painting a bearish picture for the BNB price. Binance Chain Activity Drops By 15% Last week, there had been a lot of activity on the Binance Smart Chain which saw daily active addresses climb as high as 1.2 million at the start of the weekend. However, as the new week is ushered in, this metric has taken a swift beating and the number of daily active addresses has declined dramatically. Related Reading: Polygon Profitability Tanks As MATIC Nosedives 5.6% Data from YCharts show that in the last 24 hours, Binance Smart Chain active addresses were down by more than 15.70%. This showed a complete reversal in the high usage recorded between Friday and Saturday when activity on the chain had surpassed all other blockchains. Currently, the number sits at 947,414 daily active addresses on the blockchain. So from Friday to now, active addresses are down by more than 150,000. BSC daily active addresses falls 15% | Source: YCharts New unique addresses per day were also down during this time and are down by 15.27% in the 24-hour period. Likewise, transactions per day also took a beating, falling 15.27% during this time while transaction fees realized on the network declined by 10.86%. Interestingly, the daily active BEP-20 addresses on the Binance Smart Chain saw the most upside for the time period with a 9.84% growth, as well as the BSC average transaction fee seeing a 6.58% rise to $0.1457 per transaction. How Will BNB Price Respond? At the start of the weekend when activity on the Binance Smart Chain had begun to surge, there was a notable increase in the BNB price during this time. The digital asset had clocked a local peak of $264 on Friday before active addresses had begun to lose momentum. BNB price trending below $250 | Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com By Saturday, the more than 100,000 declines in daily active addresses were followed by a sharp drop in the price of BNB. This drop to the $220 territory showed a correlation between the activity on the blockchain and the price of the coin.

Another 10% drop from current prices will see the digital asset revisit the $220 territory once more. BNB is changing hands at a price of $246 at the time of this writing.

42388331,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREIMl,1671490130,Wanted Russian Parliament Member May Own a Crypto Broker in Moscow: Report,"Andrei Lugovoi, the Russian parliament's chief crypto expert, may be connected to a cash over-the-counter (OTC) network located in Moscow, according to Dossier, a Russian media outlet that published an investigation on Monday.  According to Dossier, an OTC called Bankoff is operating from an office owned by a company directed by Lugovoi's wife, Ksenia. Bankoff appears to be the most active trader on Binance's peer-to-peer marketplace for deals with Russian ruble, with the highest daily trading volumes, according to Dossier's research. The almost non-existent know-your-customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) procedures allow users to buy and sell crypto via Bankoff without revealing their identity, Dossier said. (An OTC is a broker-dealer as opposed to a centralized exchange.)  To close a deal with Bankoff, one must go to the Federation Tower of the fancy Moscow City business district in Russia's capital, and bring cash to the office. According to documents from Russia's property registry, the office space belongs to a company named Bratsk Electric Networks. It is owned by three people, of which Ksenia Lugovaya's share is 22.5%, according to Russia's business ownership database. (CoinDesk independently reviewed the records.)  It's not clear whether Bratsk Electric Networks owns the OTC operating from its office space or renting it out. However, the same company owns a crypto mining farm in the Russian city of Bratsk, according to local media. Bratsk, located in the heart of Siberia right by the Bratsk hydro power plant, became one of the favorite locations for miners due to its cold climate and abundance of cheap electricity.

42411043,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBDsn,1671488207,How Institutional Investors Are Handling the Crypto Crash,"Crypto, in this economy? Bitcoin is down approximately 63% in value since this time last year and the industry is on fire after the catastrophic bankruptcy of FTX, which came just six months after the $25 billion collapse of one of DeFi’s most popular projects, Terra.  Now, traditional investors are retreating from crypto and licking their wounds. Major investors in FTX such as asset manager BlackRock, which participated in the exchange’s meme-laden $420.69 million funding round, got sorely burned – as did the Ontario Teacher's Pension Plan fund, which has written off its $95 million investment in FTX. Crypto-friendly hedge funds are limiting their exposure, too. A June 2022 survey (pre-FTX) from PWC on crypto hedge funds found that while hedge funds increased their assets under management by 8% on the year to $4.1 billion, they reduced their exposure to the market. Over half invested less than 1% of their holdings in crypto.  Some institutional investors have given up on crypto altogether. The asset class “will not find a home in institutional asset allocation,"" Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at London’s Pinebridge Investments, told Bloomberg last month. “There was a period when it was being considered as a potential asset class that every investor should have in their strategic asset allocation and that’s off the table entirely.""  After institutional investors backed out, the ProShares Bitcoin ETF, once a popular vehicle with moneyed financial companies, quickly became the sixth-worst-performing exchange-traded fund of all time, according to the Financial Times. Net inflows of $1.8 billion in its first year trickled out after bitcoin’s price crashed, and its holdings stood at just over $500 million as of Nov. 21, 2022.  “We’ve seen funds nosedive right out of the gate in this manner, but rarely do they attract so much in assets so soon after launching like [this] did,” Jeffrey Ptak, chief ratings officer at Morningstar Research Services, told the FT.  With frostier attitudes toward the industry, crypto’s own suite of institutional investors is struggling to stay alive. Lenders including BlockFi, CoinDesk sister company Genesis and SALT have paused withdrawals. Voyager Digital and Celsius Network already went bust over the summer.  Hedge funds that had exposure to FTX are marking down investments to $0 and forgetting about their investments in its exchange token, FTT, altogether.  JPMorgan analysts predict a wave of deleveraging, marked by a “cascade of margin calls,” to follow the collapse of FTX. (Those same analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, once said that bitcoin could reach $146,000 if it replaced gold as a safe haven asset. Panigirtzoglou now thinks that it could hit as low as $13,000.) Singaporean crypto hedge fund QCP Capital predicted that token prices will fall further, and that crypto markets have diverged from their correlation with traditional markets, having tracked the commodities market since 2017.  Accordingly, CoinShares found that investors are shorting crypto more than ever before, reporting “the largest inflows into short-investments on record.” In August, 51% of available shares in bitcoin-holding MicroStrategy, worth $1.35 billion, were sold short. “This will hurt badly, more so than any other crisis our industry has faced before,” wrote QCP in a market update. “Trust, the most expensive commodity outside of time has been lost, and it will take a lot of time to build back as a whole.”  Explore the Future of Finance at Consensus 2023  Join the Money Reimagined Summit, taking place at the annual Consensus gathering in Austin, Texas this April, to map out the future of finance and investing with a gathering of institutional and retail investors, hedge fund managers, OTC digital asset traders, exchange providers, venture capitalists, smart contract developers, bankers, compliance officers, lawyers, custodians and everyone in between.

42388326,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREIDP,1671487289,Bitcoin Addresses Tied to Defunct Canadian Crypto Exchange QuadrigaCX Wake Up,"More than 100 bitcoins tied to the defunct Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX were transferred out of cold wallets thought to be beyond anyone’s control over the weekend, after sitting dormant for more than three years. The company's bankruptcy trustee, Ernst and Young, did not initiate the transfers, CoinDesk has learned.  QuadrigaCX went bankrupt in 2019 after the apparent death of founder and CEO Gerald Cotten. At the time of its collapse, Quadriga was believed to have owed thousands of customers nearly $200 million in various cryptocurrencies – a staggering failure for what was once Canada’s largest crypto exchange.  EY, which is acting as the trustee for Quadriga’s estate, announced in February 2019 that it lost control of about 100 BTC after mistakenly sending the coins to Quadriga-operated cold wallets that the Big Four financial services firm said it couldn’t access. At the time, the bitcoin was worth around $355,000 (C$470,000).  The bitcoin in these addresses remained frozen until last Friday, when the coins in all five addresses left between 6:52 p.m. ET and 7:14 p.m. ET.  Magdalena Gronowska, a bankruptcy inspector and member of Quadriga's creditor committee, said the funds were not moved by EY.  In total, 104.34 BTC worth around $1.7 million (C$2.4 million) at press time has left Quadriga’s wallets. Many of these funds appear to have been distributed to different wallets.  The amounts sent from each wallet match the amounts sent to those wallets in 2019. The wallets in question are:  1HyYMMCdCcHnfjwMW2jE4cv9qVkVDFUzVa  1JPtxSGoekZfLQeYAWkbhBhkr2VEDADHZB  1MhgmGaHwLAvvKVyFvy6zy9pRQFXaxwE9M  1ECUQLuioJbFZAQchcZq9pggd4EwcpuANe  1J9Fqc3TicNoy1Y7tgmhQznWrP5AVLXj9R  Blockchain sleuth zachxbt said on Twitter that the majority of these funds, nearly 70 BTC, appear to have gone to Wasabi, a coin mixing service. It is unclear why EY, a well-established financial services institution, might want to use a crypto mixing service, whose primary purpose would be to obfuscate the source and destination of funds.  ""Bankruptcy Inspectors are aware Quadriga funds have moved. Thank you to blockchain investigators for following flows, we're working to gather more information and I hope we are able to recover stolen funds,"" Gronowska said.  A spokesperson for EY and an attorney with Miller Thomson, which represents Quadriga's creditors, did not return requests for comment.  In early reports, EY said that Cotten, as the sole proprietor of Quadriga in its waning days, was the only person who could access its funds. Investigators claimed that Cotten did not maintain clear records, part of why the effort to recover customer funds is dragging into a fourth year.  The Canada Revenue Agency, the nation’s tax enforcer, is also investigating the exchange and whether or not it filed its taxes appropriately while it still operated. A person familiar with the matter said the CRA investigation was the main issue preventing the bankruptcy proceedings from continuing.  UPDATE (Dec. 19, 2022, 22:20 UTC): Adds additional detail.

This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  The bid represents the fair market value of Voyager's cryptocurrency portfolio, which has a current market value of around $1.002 billion, and an additional consideration of $20 million in incremental value.  Voyager said in the statement, ""The Binance.US bid aims to return crypto to customers in kind, in accordance with court-approved disbursements and platform capabilities.""  Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao had said last month that his exchange's U.S. wing would be making a fresh bid for Voyager Digital. CoinDesk had earlier reported that Binance was preparing a bid for the bankrupt crypto lender's assets.  Binance.US will make a good faith deposit of $10 million and will reimburse Voyager for certain expenses up to $15 million. Voyager will also seek the approval of the bankruptcy court at a hearing on Jan. 5, 2023.  Voyager, which went into bankruptcy earlier this year, had agreed to sell its assets to the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, with FTX beating out rivals Wave Financial and Binance for the assets.  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market value slid 0.8% over the past 24 hours, trading around $16,610. Equity markets also kicked off the new week with losses as traders felt the continuing nervousness over the Federal Reserve’s hawkish message last week on tighter monetary policy until it is ""sufficiently restrictive"" to bring inflation down. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 1.49%. The S&P 500 slid 0.90% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.49%.  Ether (ETH): The second-largest cryptocurrency followed BTC’s trajectory, also dropping around 0.5% to $1,170.  Filecoin (FIL) and Storj (STORJ): FIL is down 28% over the past five days, with STORJ down 20%. Data from Coinglass points to record liquidations on long positions for storage protocols' tokens: Nearly $5.7 million long FIL positions were liquidated on Dec. 16, according to Coinglass, while $365,000 in STORJ long positions were also liquidated.  Crypto Market Analysis: Bitcoin Correlations Show Dollar Still Rules (In the Inverse)  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Bitcoin’s correlation with copper has been interesting to track, rising as high as 0.9 a week ago. Its decline to 0.41 since then raises questions of reliability.  Outside of a “black swan” event specific to a centralized crypto entity, BTC’s price remains largely tethered to the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. Now that the Sam Bankman-Fried news is beginning to subside, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is reemerging as crypto’s primary antagonist, even if unintentionally so.  The takeaway is that crypto assets prices will largely be driven by inflation figures, the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and market interpretations of Fed officials’ statements. For a newer asset class with the ability to function outside of traditional finance, old-school markets and economics continue to impact its progression.  Read the full technical take here.

42389615,6F4ZR09tPAWQmeXaoSbPbE,1671483906,FTX’s Bankman-Fried Gave Ex-Jane Street Traders Who Formed Modulo Capital $400M,"When a spreadsheet listing Sam Bankman-Fried’s venture investments was published by the Financial Times earlier this month, a couple of lines stood out. They showed the former cryptocurrency kingmaker’s hedge fund, Alameda Research, had invested a total of $400 million into a company called Modulo Capital.  Though this amounted to one of Bankman-Fried’s largest venture capital bets, Modulo’s identity was a mystery, giving rise to plenty of speculation. Was it a Brazilian fund manager with a nearly identical name (besides an accent mark over the first letter O)?  No. It’s a multi-strategy hedge fund founded early this year by two former Jane Street traders and one developer, a person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk.  Modulo Capital did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Bankman-Fried or former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison.  Modulo does, however, have more in common with Bankman-Fried than some of Alameda's other venture investments.  Jane Street is a New York-based proprietary trading firm where Bankman-Fried and Ellison worked prior to making it big in the crypto industry. Bankman-Fried was known to hire former Jane Street employees as executives or employees, including former FTX US President Brett Harrison.  Also, public filings show Modulo was based in the Bahamas and operated from Albany, the same luxury condominium complex where Bankman-Fried and other FTX and Alameda employees resided.  Read more: Bankman-Fried’s Cabal of Roommates in the Bahamas Ran His Crypto Empire – and Dated. Other Employees Have Lots of Questions  Modulo traded crypto as well as traditional financial assets, two people familiar with the matter said. Modulo approached several traditional financial institutions for funding before taking on Alameda as its sole investor, one of the people added. A person familiar with the matter confirmed that Alameda did indeed invest $400 million into Modulo.  “It didn’t strike me as that crazy. Sam liked to throw money at things that were positive [expected value] and ex-Jane Street people seem relatively positive EV,” the person told CoinDesk. “It was better than some of the trash Alameda was throwing money at.”  Alameda’s investments are under heavy scrutiny as creditors await repayment from a grueling bankruptcy process involving the company and its sibling, FTX, a crypto exchange. In testimony before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee last week, new FTX CEO John J. Ray III said the deficit was estimated at $8 billion and “a complete lack of recordkeeping” has made it challenging to trace the money trail.  The list of investments on the spreadsheet also led to shocking revelations about how far Bankman-Fried’s ties stretched, including speculation over whether or not he improperly used his money to buy influence or enrich associates. In addition to the $400 million Modulo investment, Alameda also loaned $43 million to the CEO of crypto news outlet The Block, invested $25 million in Toy Ventures – a venture fund founded by FTX head of product Ramnik Arora – and acquired a $270 million stake in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission-licensed stock exchange IEX.

42407220,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJrin,1671481748,This Was the Worst Year for Crypto Hacks. Here’s How 2023 Can Be Better,"Over the past 12 months, crypto has seen a troubling flood of attacks and exploits. There have been too many to track – this is an issue that desperately needs to be addressed.  Fortunately, there’s hope. Protocols can up their game when it comes to auditing code, monitoring network activity and setting clear attack response plans when an exploit does occur. If the industry takes note and implements these protections, it’s very plausible years like this will remain in the rear view mirror.  Stephen Lloyd Webber works in product marketing at OpenZeppelin, a crypto cybersecurity tech company. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023 series.  The plague of attacks  According to Chainalysis, 2022 is on track to be the worst year on record for funds stolen through hacks and exploits. Some $3 billion was stolen, at last count.  The Ronin hack is particularly notable. In March, North Korean-linked Lazarus Group expropriated about $620 million worth of ETH and USDC from the Ronin Network, a sidechain built for the popular Web3 game Axie Infinity.  What’s most surprising is it took over a week for this attack to be discovered. Law enforcement officials have been able to recover about $30 million of the stolen funds and Binance has been able to freeze an additional $5.8 million, but the majority of assets remain under the hackers’ control.  Funds have also not yet been recovered from the Wormhole bridge attack in February. This bridge, which connects Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche and other blockchain networks, was not the first to be attacked, but it might be the most notable. Somehow an attacker was able to mint 120,000 wrapped ether, or wETH, without having to put up any collateral. They then converted that free wETH into regular ETH and SOL, netting themselves $320 million. While these funds have not been recovered, Jump Trading did step in to inject Wormhole with 120,000 ETH to bring the bridge back into operation.  Read more: With Hacks at a Record High, Crypto Needs to Find Better Ways to Keep Users Safe  The list goes on and on. Nomad bridge lost $190 million. Wintermute, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, was hit for $160 million. Even a Binance BNB Network bridge was exploited for $100 million. Something needs to be done to make cryptocurrency services more secure against hacks and exploits.  How to move forward  The good news is things don’t have to stay as dire as they are now. We will see far fewer attacks, or at least mitigate their impact, in 2023 and beyond if crypto platforms and protocols are willing to expand their defensive efforts. This can come in a variety of forms, but all involve improved monitoring as well as proactive systems in place to respond when an event does occur.  The first line of defense is for all smart contract code to be carefully audited by reputable, third-party sources. The results of these audits should also be transparently shared with the community, to properly disclose any problems found and what was done to fix them.  However, a one-time security audit isn’t enough (as we’ve seen by the multiple DeFi platforms that were audited and hacked). Instead, every time the code is updated, new audits should be performed. This will ensure no new issues are being introduced. Even a small change to the code can have unforeseen ramifications, and it’s crucial for teams to adopt a more security-centric stance as they develop and deploy smart contracts.  Audits are essential, but if they were enough the crypto space wouldn’t be seeing so many of these exploits. Even thoroughly tested and well-audited code needs to be deployed in such a way that allows teams the ability to guard against potential risk vectors. Without robust security and operational monitoring that keeps track of the state of privileged accounts as well as wider interrelationships between system components and blockchain state, users will not be able to trust that their funds are secure.  This is why there is a need for a more real-time, proactive approach to security for decentralized services. Projects need to have systems in place that actively monitor transactions on a given platform and can detect anomalous or suspicious activity such as sudden spikes in usage, changes in price or interaction with blacklisted accounts as well as governance proposals submitted using flash loans.  In many cases, the first sign of an attack is exactly that – transactions are unusually large and/or many are going to the same address in a very short period of time. Being able to detect these events as they happen can help teams stay informed about potential threats. It also opens the door for such measures to be automated, eliminating or minimizing the need for human interaction.  Read more: Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error | Opinion  Lastly, even the most finely tuned operational and security monitoring is limited in helpfulness without some form of response system in place as well. A team that has thoroughly mapped the attack vectors of their systems can plan their responses well in advance of an actual security incident. Smoke tests and thorough planning are a key step in this direction so that based on the alerts each relevant actor can assess the situation and respond to it quickly. This means steps to halt and reverse damage can be taken in hours or even minutes, instead of days or weeks.  Even in the event that there is a loss of funds, a prompt response is crucial to prevent further loss of funds. It may also help bolster trust in the team behind a protocol, even if the system has already been shown to be in jeopardy.  As a security-first mentality becomes ubiquitous, it will also help to deter attackers from attempting such exploits in the first place, as they will know that they will be spotted immediately. Community-led security monitoring efforts help ensure the security of the overall ecosystem by incentivizing such monitoring and allowing anyone to have a window into the operational health of protocols on the blockchain.  To be sure, there isn’t necessarily a “one size fits all” solution for every project out there, but all protocols could benefit from a combination of recurring audits, active security and operational monitoring of their networks, and an automated incident notification and response system.  Such actions have proven to be indispensable, and they are measures taken by leading players in the Web3 ecosystem such as Compound Finance and Matter Labs. If more teams take measures such as these, hopefully 2022 will be the last year where crypto is setting records for the most money ever stolen through an exploit. The sooner the broader industry gets on board, the sooner these events can largely be left in the past.",NEGATIVE,ETH | BNB,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB,Stephen Webber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/19/cryptocurrency-exploit-hack-prevention,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f90d498f248160b6bb22cfbc7ae8e8ba635931c6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

From a monthly momentum perspective, the bearish trend is now the strongest on record. Let’s take a look at what this means and where the market is at by comparison. Log MACD Points To Worst Crypto Winter In History As a speculative asset class, cryptocurrencies are volatile – wildly driven by speculation and polar opposite ends of greed and fear. There is no denying the current market is some of the most fearful since Bitcoin’s inception. It was born in wake of the 2008 financial crisis and the top cryptocurrency is now facing its first potential recession. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Explodes Around $18K Level, As Fed Reveals 50 Basis Point Rate Increase Previous monetary policy allowed the asset class to flourish and grow, while the current policy has caused prices to contract significantly in short order. The result, is quite possibly the worst bear market in Bitcoin’s history, according to the LMACD. Monthly bearish momentum is the strongest ever | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com LMACD is the logarithmic version of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator. The original tool was created by Gerald Appel in the late 1970s, while this version is best used to compare historical momentum. When viewing the monthly LMACD for BTCUSD, the dashed zero line shows that in 2018, Bitcoin never even made it into bear territory. During this bear market, the MACD line in blue is also at the lowest point ever historically. The signal line in orange has never moved below the zero line, and could very well do so in this cycle. Has The Bitcoin Bull Trend Officially Ended? According to the Average Directional Index and each Direction Movement Indicator, bears are stronger than ever before, and have had the upper hand in crypto for the longest stretch ever.

Rising back above a reading of 20 after falling below it, should help confirm a new bullish trend. The bull trend has ended, but will a new one begin? | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Although the ADX shows the bull trend never quite concluded in 2018, the weaker trend strength overall explains why the returns stemming from the 2018 bottom, weren’t anywhere near the same as the rally from the 2015 bottom, which had significant strength at its back. With the bullish trend fizzling out, when bulls regain control and a new trend blossoms, it could be far more sustainable than what we have witnessed the last several years in crypto.

42420859,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtVmv,1671479120,Crypto Markets Analysis: Bitcoin Correlations Show Dollar Still Rules (in the Inverse),"Over recent weeks we’ve made a point of highlighting bitcoin (BTC) and ether’s (ETH) correlations with different assets, and the extent to which they’ve sustained or changed over time.  That process, often referred to as intermarket analysis, aims to give insight into how one asset price might move, based on factors that impact another.  The measuring stick is the correlation coefficient, ranging from -1 to 1. A coefficient of 1 implies a direct pricing relationship, with a coefficient of -1 indicates a completely inverse relationship.  Bitcoin and ether, despite the differences in their blockchain consensus mechanisms, total supply and utility, have enjoyed a persistently strong pricing relationship, with a correlation coefficient above 0.9 for all of November and most of December. The coefficient now sits at 0.85, still extremely strong.  Other correlations we’ve been tracking include bitcoin’s relationships to equities, metals, energy and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY):  What stands out besides BTC’s reliable correlation to ETH is the persistently inverse relationship to the DXY.  The 0.84 reading on Nov. 19 appears to be an outlier. BTC held an inverse pricing relationship with the DXY for the better part of 2022, turning positive between Nov. 9 and Nov. 27, but largely related to the FTX collapse.  For traders, the consistently positive relationship between BTC and ETH, and the equally consistent inverse relationship between BTC and DXY, presents an opportunity should those correlations stray from their norms.  While BTC appears poised to trade flat for the time being, a deviation in the relationship can be an opportunity – because correlations typically revert to their mean.  Bitcoin’s correlation with copper has been interesting to track, rising as high as 0.9 a week ago. Its decline to 0.41 since then raises questions of reliability.  Outside of a ""black swan"" event specific to a centralized crypto entity, BTC’s price remains largely tethered to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions.  Now that the Sam Bankman-Fried news is beginning to subside, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is reemerging as crypto’s primary antagonist, even if unintentionally so.  The takeaway is that crypto assets prices will largely be driven by inflation figures, the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and market interpretations of Fed officials’ statements.  For a newer asset class with the ability to function outside of traditional finance, old-school markets and economics continue to impact its progression.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/19/crypto-markets-analysis-bitcoin-correlations-show-dollar-still-rules-in-the-inverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be1bb2bea1fc6f8324723509a460fbfa572198a6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394081,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXFc9,1671476477,Elon Musk's Twitter Mistakes Prove Web3's Point,"When Elon Musk initially took over daily operations at Twitter he said the world would know he’s doing the right thing if both sides of the political aisle were ticked off. Well, people are upset, but not because the billionaire technocrat is doing a good job – and there’s data to show it.  On Sunday evening, Musk put out a Twitter poll asking if he should remain at Twitter’s helm. The votes are in, and 57.5% of respondents think Musk should step down. And if he’s a man of his word, he will.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  If this sounds like an odd way to set the course of what is arguably the internet’s “town square” it’s at least consistent with Musk’s erratic and seemingly self-destructive management style since overbidding for the microblogging platform.  See also: Elon Musk Shouldn't Lead Twitter | Opinion  Last week alone, Twitter suspended multiple journalists’ accounts, moved to block off-site linking to competitor social media platforms and set a policy banning discussions of publicly available flight data. All of this, of course, belies Musk’s stated commitment to free speech.  The self-contradictions are funny in the Shakespearean tragicomic sense that saw Brutus turn tyrannical after trying to prevent Rome from slipping into a dictatorship at the hands of Julius Caesar. Musk banned a fan of his that tracked his private jet after specifically saying he’d protect for the sake of a higher principle. The man who reportedly read two books per day must be a student of dramatic irony.  For perhaps all but Musk’s peers this disastrous leadership has come as no surprise. Y-Combinator founder Paul Graham, who had supported Musk’s takeover, called his latest tantrum “the last straw” and directed readers to his Mastodon profile. His account was briefly suspended.  Still, the situation could be worse. Especially for crypto, the source of many of Twitter’s woes, Musk's erratic example has only proved the importance of democratically managed and open source platforms. (At the very least, Musk has promised all “major policy decisions” will be put to a vote.)  As Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin put it, Twitter under Musk is on the path to “authoritarianism.” It’s worth noting that Musk has dissolved the company’s board, pushed out many of its executives and paid non-aligned employees to leave. Even if he steps down as sole owner and director, Musk can appoint a successor CEO and micromanage as he sees fit.  “The problem is the way in which the policies were introduced, seeming to retrofit around Elon's views on very specific situations. Basically ‘central planning as overfitting’: https://radicalxchange.org/media/blog/2018-11-26-4m9b8b/… Good policy should be decided behind veil of ignorance first, applied second,” Buterin wrote, responding to fellow PayPal mafioso and Musk friend David Sacks.  Putting aside overzealous obituaries, the possible collapse of Twitter only helps reaffirm the belief that alternatives should exist. Social media, a relatively new phenomenon in the scheme of things, has been captured by mindvirus that monopolies are good – as explained by Peter Thiel in his influential “Zero to One” startup guide.  It’s true that network effects matter – having an overabundance of friends and foes on a website makes things fun. But the idea that software has to be captured by financial interests, that even publicly traded firms should be controlled by supermajority stockholders, is insane.  See also: Jack Dorsey Gives Decentralized Social Network Nostr 14 BTC  No one knows if it’s lights out for Twitter. The “vibes are off” and users and advertisers are leaving in droves. Musk claims the company is heading to bankruptcy. Things could also miraculously turn around, or the site could drag on for decades, like debt-ladden, private-equity owned radio conglomerates.  And, to be sure, Musk hasn’t been all bad. It’s possible he kick-started a trend across legacy tech towards leaner companies with a chance of turning a profit. And the so-called “Twitter Files,” select internal documents released showing how the U.S. federal government may have influenced content moderation policies, should go further.  But the damage is done. Egoism is out, communities are in. Centralism is flawed, public goods are great. What Web3 makes of the moment is up to you, dear reader.

The FSMB has already been debated in the House of Commons and is set to have its second reading in Parliament's upper house, the House of Lords, by Jan. 10. It will be sent back to the House of Commons after that, where any amendments from the House of Lords will be considered. When both houses agree, the bill will be sent to King Charles III where it can be made an Act before taking effect.  “This is of course an important milestone and will enable us to make substantial progress on the provisions within the Bill, including repealing and replacing burdensome pages of retained EU (European Union) law governing the sector, measures to embrace crypto asset technology, and measures to protect the consumer,"" the Treasury spokesperson said.  The FSMB is crucial because it will make way for crypto to be regulated in the U.K., something that regulators have increasingly called for since the collapse of what was once the third-largest exchange, FTX. Plus, the country wants to be a crypto hub and has some catching up to do with the European Union, which has finalized a crypto rule book in its Markets in Crypto Assets regulation.  If the FSMB is passed as is, it will ensure crypto is treated as a regulated activity and give the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Payments Systems Regulator power to regulate the sector and protect consumers. Currently, the FCA only has power to ensure crypto companies register with it and comply with its anti-money laundering rules. An amendment was recently approved that will enable the FCA to regulate crypto under the existing promotions rules, which could make it near impossible for crypto firms to advertise to U.K. clients.  It is possible that the bill could end up being passed outside of the Treasury’s expected time frame. No Parliament sites have listed a timeline for the bill's passage yet.

Updated at 21:40 UTC: Sam Bankman-Fried has agreed to be extradited to the U.S., reports the Washington Post, citing a person familiar with the matter. His counsel is reportedly preparing the necessary documents and Bankman-Fried is expected to appear back in a Bahamas courtroom.  Weekend reports suggested Bankman-Fried had changed his mind and was not going to challenge extradition to the U.S., where he faces a host of criminal charges relating to misuse of customer funds and misleading of investors from the Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Eyewitness News in Bahamas reported that Bankman-Fried attorney Jerome Roberts told Judge Shaka Serville he was unaware until minutes prior to the hearing that there would be a court appearance today. He reportedly called this morning's proceedings ""shocking"" and ""premature.""  Reuters, meanwhile, reported that Bankman-Fried's counsel requested to see the U.S. indictment against the former FTX CEO prior to agreeing to waive an extradition challenge – a curious request given the indictment has been public for nearly one week.

42407217,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJkgL,1671471698,The 10 Biggest Developments in Bitcoin in 2022,"Price crashes and crypto collapses dominated headlines in 2022, but it was a year of significant progress for Bitcoin. In 2022, we saw how Bitcoin as a protocol allows for widespread innovation that fills whatever needs developers and entrepreneurs identify without any need for changes to that protocol. We’ve highlighted 10 important developments below.  1. Another year of 100% uptime  The greatest achievement in Bitcoin this year was, once again, Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin continued to operate flawlessly, with one block coming roughly every 10 minutes and its coin issuance precisely adhering to what was set out in Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper in 2008. There were no emergency restarts, no hard forks, no chain splits and no protocol-level hacks or bugs. Yet again, Bitcoin delivered 100% uptime and was available to anyone in the world all year in the face of everything 2022 threw at it. Billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin were transferred every single day on its blockchain.  Bitcoin did all this without any foundation supporting it, without any direct employees, without any leaders or venture capitalists. As such, ongoing developments that rely on Bitcoin’s reliability and predictability were able to proceed with uninterrupted focus for yet another year and with the confidence that they’ll be able to do so for the foreseeable future.  It is worth noting that none of the remaining items on this list require any changes to Bitcoin’s base layer consensus rules.  2. Growth of the Lightning Network  While Bitcoin’s base layer remains rock steady, its most significant scaling protocol, the Lightning Network, experienced massive growth and development in 2022. Lightning Network allows for instant, cheap payments off-chain, eliminating the need to wait for a block to confirm transactions. It is entirely decentralized and permissionless and improves Bitcoin’s scalability while still leveraging the security and settlement assurances of Bitcoin’s base layer. The network’s publicly visible liquidity capacity rose from 1,058 BTC to more than 4,771 BTC in 2022.  The number of Lightning Network channels rose by +80%, from 37,298 to 67,339 channels.  The number of publicly visible Lightning Network nodes increased by +88%, from 8,295 to 15,636 nodes (though the rate of growth slowed in the second half).  All told, the growth of the Lightning Network was astounding this year, driven by numerous wallets that were launched, better tools for users that were built, and more educational resources that were produced. Instant, cheap payments (typically under 1 U.S. cent) became widespread in 2022 as Bitcoiners looked to exchange value peer-to-peer over the Lightning Network.  3. El Salvador – where no nation has gone before  In 2022, El Salvador experienced the greatest country rebrand in history under President Nayib Bukele’s policy of economic liberty and Bitcoin. Bukele appeared on the cover of Bitcoin Magazine's year-end edition, which showed the president looking like the Founding Father of hyperbitcoinization, the first mover and the leader who dared to embrace Bitcoin-only and the economic liberty it offered to his people.  Read more: What Is Bitcoin's Lightning Network?  In the column, Bukele called for all Bitcoiners around the world to recognize that El Salvador's fight against the global elites is their fight, too. El Salvador’s embracement of the bitcoin currency made clear to all that it understands exactly what revolutionary money actually is, despite the FUD from mainstream media. While U.S. regulators and political elites got taken in by the likes of Sam Bankman-Fried, bitcoin led to boom times in El Salvador. Tourism numbers have skyrocketed, GDP is growing and the country keeps stacking sats.  October saw the creation by El Salvador of the world's first “Bitcoin Embassy” in Lugano. This chamber of commerce will be headed by Salvadoran bitcoin miner and investor turned Bitcoin diplomat and “Honorary Consul” Josue Lopez. November saw the creation of the Bitcoin Office within the Office of the El Salvadoran President. The office was created to meet the growing demand for access and information from investors worldwide. The Bitcoin Office further establishes the El Salvador template for more nations to copy on the road to hyperbitcoinization. El Salvador closed out the year in the most bitcoin way of all – with President Bukele announcing that El Salvador would start buying one bitcoin every single day.  4. Machankura – transacting with bitcoin over text in Africa  This new service was coded in a few weeks by African developer, Kgothatso Ngako, who noticed a problem – most Africans have basic phones but don’t have access to a reliable internet connection – so he created a solution. Machankura enables people in Africa to receive and spend bitcoin via text messages without needing an internet connection. In a report from Caribou, 94% of financial transactions in Africa are made through text messages, and only 6% of these transactions are made via mobile apps. ​​This new service allows individuals throughout Africa to use bitcoin for the first time on technology that is already at their disposal. Projects like Machankura will help push bitcoin adoption in regions that need digital sound money the most.  5. Taro – assets on the Lightning Network  This year, Lightning Labs introduced a protocol proposal to Bitcoin and the Lightning Network that aims to allow for the minting, sending and receiving of assets on the networks. Taro utilizes Bitcoin’s latest protocol upgrade, Taproot, to enable the issuance of theoretically any kind of asset on the Bitcoin blockchain while still using the immutable verification of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Taro could allow for all kinds of assets like stablecoins, stocks, and bonds to be issued on top of the Bitcoin protocol opening the door for more use cases and more functionality on the network.  6. Impervious.ai – The first P2P Lightning-native browser  Impervious Technologies launched the first web browser built on top of Bitcoin’s second-layer scaling system, the Lightning Network. It is a peer-to-peer web browser that offers a full suite of tools for communication, data transfers,and Lightning payments without any middlemen. This comes in the form of secure peer-to-peer messaging, P2P video calls, P2P workspaces, decentralized identity management, decentralized data storage and direct user monetization of their data. All of these tools are fully encrypted, and they remove centralized intermediaries that collect and sell the user’s data. By utilizing the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin and Lightning networks, Impervious Technologies has given us a hint of what the Internet will look like in the future.  7. FediMints – collaborative custody  FediMint is a new method to custody bitcoin by forming collaborative custody communities to help secure each others’ bitcoin and protect privacy. This form of custody takes advantage of the inherent fact that humans trust those closest to them the most. It leverages technologies like federations and (David) Chaumian e-cash mints to cryptographically maintain privacy between the individuals of a group while also allowing them to share custody of the entire group’s bitcoin. This custody solution offers the possibility to scale bitcoin, improve privacy, lower on-chain fees and can get more individuals to take self-custody of their bitcoin around the world.  8. Value-4-Value – embedding payment functionality anywhere  Value-4-Value is a new approach to content publishing where the creator receives value after the “customer” enjoys the content, once again, through the Lightning Network. Over 10,000 content creators have already implemented Value-4-Value on their podcasts, and solutions such as LightningAddresses and Bolt-12 invoices, are making this possible for all other types of content, promising continued rapid growth in 2023.  9. Plebnet Lightning – community tools to make Lightning more functional  An informal Telegram group of ordinary people interested in running their own Lightning nodes formed and is about to cross over 5,800 members.  Not only do participants provide support to each other on best practices, but community members have developed and released numerous open-source applications to make some of the most advanced capabilities of Lightning Network easily accessible to anyone. sdLightning Terminal is a browser-based interface for managing channel liquidity on self-hosted Lightning nodes, performing submarine swaps via the Lightning Loop service, classifying channels and integrating loopd, poold, and faraday daemon. Balance of satoshis makes it easy to balance channels, making it easy to issue lightning transactions that balance channels' inbound and outbound liquidity. LNDg and Lightning Jet offer similar capabilities with more advanced features for monitoring nodes and maximizing efficiency.  10. Gridless computing with BTC mining  All over the world, people live with very little, very expensive or no electricity. Bitcoin mining is changing all this. One example, shared by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, was powering a rural Kenyan village while securing the Bitcoin network with excess hydropower, all while lowering rates to 2,000 people (500 families) by approximately $10 a month to only $4.  Far from being an isolated example, a further $2 million in the financing, led by Stillmark VC and Block, was secured in December to use bitcoin mining to increase energy access across Africa while further distributing and securing the Bitcoin network.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | FORKS,"Cory Klippsten, Tomer Strolight, Sam Callahan",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/19/the-10-biggest-developments-in-bitcoin-in-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d047b895381969f6818c4060d8cfbb41c2ebf7b7-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The market is moving in tandem with the legacy financial sector, pricing in a higher terminal rate for 2023. Related Reading: Tron Snags 2nd Place In TVL – What Does This Mean For TRX Price? As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $16,600 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. In the previous week, the cryptocurrency is recording a 3% loss. Previous outperformers, such as Dogecoin, Polygon, and Ethereum, are seeing heavy losses on similar timeframes. Bitcoin Likely To Bounce Back In The Coming Days? The number one crypto is trending to the downside after the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell spoke about the current macroeconomic conditions. During last week’s Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed Chair highlighted his objective to continue fighting inflation. This decision might lead to lower interest rates in the short term, but the Fed targets a higher terminal rate, the percentage at which the institution will finally pivot, in the long term. The market is reacting to this new reality. According to several reports, market participants were expecting a terminal rate of around 5%, which increased to 5.5%. Interest rates could remain this high until 2024. Several Fed representatives echoed the same hawkish message. New York Fed President John Williams said: (…) we’re going to have to do what’s necessary” to get inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target… (terminal or peak rate) could be higher than what we’ve written down. As the Fed gave its message, Bitcoin saw a clean rejection from the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). If the cryptocurrency can breach this level, it might begin shifting the bearish trend and reclaim previously lost territory. BTC is battling with the loss in bullish momentum and seems at risk of returning to its yearly lows. Bulls must hold the line at around $16,200 to $16,500 to prevent further downside. Data from Material Indicators point to a spike in volatility for the coming week. On Thursday, the U.S. will publish data on its job market. If this country’s economy remains strong, the Fed will have the support it needs to continue hiking interest rates. Therefore, vital economic data will remain a bearish indicator for Bitcoin and traditional equities. Conversely, Material Indicators record a long signal on their Trend Precognition indicator. This signal might hint at a BTC price recovery for the short term. 2/6 On the 2Day & 3Day TFs, the predictive A1 Slope Line is indicating that bullish momentum may continue for #BTC into Tuesday but it starts fading by mid week. Keep in mind, the A1 Slope Line is a real time indicator so it can and will change if detects a shift in momentum. pic.twitter.com/GaEEKf2U2A — Material Indicators (@MI_Algos) December 19, 2022 Related Reading: Ethereum Price Balks As Dormant Whales Reactivate Is this indicator hinting at favorable volatility for the bulls after the upcoming jobless report?

The blockchain protocol platform co-founder contends this will make room for hiring more developers within the ecosystem.  She told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” the FTX collapse took place at a time of “mass layoffs from really well-run companies,” so that from a recruitment perspective “this is actually a pretty golden opportunity.”  “A lot of what FTX was doing through its venture arm [FTX Ventures] was increasing the valuations of companies and creating extremely outsized expectations,” Breitman said. “Having expectations pulled down to Earth while a lot of challenges [are] coming into the market is actually pretty great, from a [developer's] perspective.”  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Won’t Contest US Extradition: Reports  Breitman said that while blockchain technology isn’t to blame for FTX’s downfall, that downfall has been a “massive distraction” for the industry, especially for those unfamiliar with crypto.  FTX, based in the Bahamas, imploded and filed for bankruptcy protection not long after a CoinDesk report detailed how its corporate sibling, Alameda Research, had a substantial amount of FTX’s native token, FTT, on its balance sheet. FTX and Alameda Research founder Sam Bankman-Fried is currently awaiting extradition to the United States from the Bahamas for misleading investors. He faces charges including intent to commit wire fraud, money laundering and other criminal charges.  According to Breitman, the industry can recover from the dark shadow cast by the collapse of FTX. She added that FTX’s wrongdoings “could have happened in pretty much any industry.”  Read more: Media Groups Win Right to Argue for Publication of FTX’s Million-Strong Creditor List  Breitman said that, in future, investors should be more “discerning” about the projects that interest them and examine who will be running them.

An increase in the interest rate by the Fed reduces the investment attractiveness of Bitcoin, which is reflected in the continued downward pressure on its price. Riot Blockchain's EBITDA was negative even when the price of Bitcoin exceeded $50,000 per coin. The crypto industry needs stricter regulation with a mandatory audit of the activities of crypto exchanges and coin developers in order to increase investor confidence. On December 13, Binance customers withdrew funds in the amount of about $1.9 billion, which is one of the largest values in recent years. A month after the collapse of the FTX ( FTT-USD ) cryptocurrency exchange and a month-long period of consolidation in the range of $15,500-$17,200 per Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the most popular cryptocurrency was trying to break out of the bearish trend and was trading above $18,000 for a short time. Despite the appearance of the first signs of optimism in the market, the situation began to worsen again, primarily due to news of a potential criminal case against the world's largest crypto exchange Binance (BNB-USD), and doubts about the quality of the audit report on its reserves. As a result, on December 13 , Binance customers withdrew funds in the amount of about $1.9 billion, which is one of the largest values in recent years. N_Aisenstadt - TradingView At the moment, the key tasks for analysts, investors, and traders of cryptocurrencies are to determine whether the short-term period of sideways movement is just a respite before the continuation of the bearish trend or whether the situation in the market has begun to change and we can see a restart of the bull cycle again. In this article, I will present an analysis of the impact of the Fed's interest rate hike on the crypto industry, the financial situation of miners, and the situation around Binance and Tether, which is the world's largest stablecoin. The situation around the largest crypto exchange Binance More than a month has passed since the bankruptcy of one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX, but at the same time, the nervousness in society does not fade away but only intensifies. This is reflected in the withdrawal of Bitcoins from exchanges to cold wallets or their exchange for fiat currencies. In the first half of December, the rate of withdrawal of coins reached a record level of 201,650 Bitcoins per month, which has not happened since the emergence of cryptocurrencies as investment assets. Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode Moreover, one of the key cyclical indicators, namely Reserve Risk, can be used to determine the ratio of risk and reward in relation to the confidence of long-term investors in Bitcoin. This indicator is able to model the relationship between the current price of an asset and investors' confidence in its ability to rise in price in the future. At the moment, Reserve Risk continues to fall, which indicates that the panic in the market continues, which is what long-term investors take advantage of by accumulating Bitcoin. These investors are convinced of the prospects for the global use of cryptocurrencies and go against the opinion of most traders and investors looking for more conservative assets. Historically, when this indicator fell to 0.008 and below, then this period marked the presence of Bitcoin in a late bearish cycle and soon, there is a high probability of the beginning of its accumulation phase, which usually lasts from 1 to 3 months, followed by a trend change from bearish to bullish. Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode Over the past five weeks, the head of Binance has been trying to improve the investment attractiveness of the crypto market and reduce the degree of tension among market participants in order to stabilize the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), and other assets. However, as often happens, his actions only caused bewilderment and increased criticism in his direction. After the FTX crash, Changpeng Zhao is keen to demonstrate that Binance, unlike many other crypto exchanges, has the necessary reserves to cover clients' assets and liabilities. At first, the head of Binance questioned the reserves of Coinbase ( COIN ), but this only slightly damaged his reputation, since Coinbase is a public company that publishes financial statements every quarter, undergoing a thorough audit. Author's elaboration, based on quarterly securities report However, the financial report was too brief, it lacked information about Binance's obligations to third parties and, most importantly, it lacked information about the issuance of Binance Coin and its use in conducting various investment activities of the company. As a result, the published superficial report only angered the crypto community and led to a multibillion-dollar outflow of assets from Binance and confused global economists responsible for auditing and financial reporting. I believe that crypto exchange reserve reporting is still a painful topic for an industry that dates back long before the FTX crash and as a result, tougher action from regulators is needed. For example, in court cases between the New York Attorney General's office and Tether , whose main goal is to replace the dollar to facilitate the trading of digital currencies, it was demonstrated that despite the fact that Tether ( USDT-USD ) is required to be fully backed by the dollar held in reserve, but that was far from the case in 2017. Author's elaboration, based on a settlement agreement between Tether and NYAG As a result of the agreement reached between the two parties, in addition to a multi-million dollar fine, Tether must publish a report every quarter to make sure the main stablecoin is reliable. Author's elaboration, based on a settlement agreement between Tether and NYAG As often happens, Tether's first audit report came out clumsy and was a document containing only two charts in which there was no complete information about Tether's reserves. Over time, the quality of reports has improved, but they are still far from the level of public companies traded on exchanges such as the Nasdaq ( NDAQ ), the New York Stock Exchange, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. I believe that the leaders of the crypto industry need to take the initiative and start hiring the most respected audit firms, giving them full access to their activities. The main reasons for this are demonstrating to Wall Street that the crypto industry has come a long way in its development and demonstrating to regulators in the US and Europe that they are willing to work together to increase people's level of trust in cryptocurrencies. The impact of the Fed rate hike on Bitcoin The Fed is successfully coping with slowing inflation through continued interest rate hikes, but like any decision, there are positive and negative consequences. The downside of the Fed's rate hike is the continued decline in the price of cryptocurrencies and continued downward pressure on the stock market as traders and investors seek to hedge against a potential recession. In 2022, the historical chart of Bitcoin shows that its price has declined by more than 8% in most cases since the FOMC meetings, in which the decision to raise the interest rate was made. Especially significant drops in the price of Bitcoin occurred in May and June when it fell by more than 20%. The logical explanation for this trend is the increased investment attractiveness of such assets as Treasury bonds ( US10Y ) ( US2Y ), whose yields have increased significantly in recent quarters. N_Aisenstadt - TradingView A similar trend occurred in 2017-2018, which only reinforces my assumption that the increase in the Fed's interest rate is negatively reflected in high-risk assets. N_Aisenstadt - TradingView On December 14, 2022, Jerome Powell stated the following during a press conference. ""But there's an expectation, really, that the -- that the services inflation will not move down so quickly, so that we'll have to stay at it so that we may have to raise rates higher to get to where we want to go. And that's really why we are writing down those high rates and why we're expecting that they'll have to remain high for a time."" FOMC participants expect a continuation of tight monetary policy in 2023 and that the Fed's interest rate may exceed 5%, which is a record value in recent decades. Federal Reserve System As a result, I believe that there will be an increase in volatility among cryptocurrencies in the coming weeks and one of the most correct decisions is to reduce the number of transactions until the formation of a clearer trend, which always comes after the end of a crypto blizzard. Financial position of crypto miners in the second half of 2022 In the second half of 2022, the difficulty of Bitcoin mining is growing relentlessly and thereby reducing the margins of crypto miners experiencing some of the most difficult periods in their history, which could result in their massive bankruptcy if the price of BTC continues to remain below the cost of its production for at least three more months. So, as of December 16, mining difficulty increased by 31.7% compared to the previous year and by 16% compared to the beginning of the 3rd quarter of 2022. Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode Moreover, the competition among miners is also evident in the increase in the Bitcoin hash rate, which reached a record high of 267.4 Exahash per second, which is a 23.5% increase since July 1, 2022. Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode One of the leaders in the industry, namely Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ), in its press release stated that the total hashing power could reach 12.5 EH/s during the first quarter of 2023, which is significantly more than the previous year. Riot Blockchain press release On the one hand, this indicates the continued confidence of the company's management and investors in the growth in asset prices, but on the other hand, this will negatively affect smaller miners, who find it more difficult to obtain the funding necessary to continue their operations. If we consider historical trends, then the increase in network difficulty requires the largest miners to constantly increase the amount of equipment and thereby not only increases the one-time cost of their purchase but also leads to an increase in the cost of their maintenance and electricity. As a result, this negatively affects the ability of industry leaders to achieve positive EBITDA, even at times when the price of Bitcoin reaches multi-year highs. For example, in the 4th quarter of 2021, Riot's EBITDA was -3.1 million US dollars, with an average price of Bitcoin of $54,804. Created by author Moreover, the negative point in the conduct of Riot's management is the fact that the share of coins that were sold from the total number of Bitcoins mined is increasing from month to month, despite the fall in their value. In other words, I believe that the effectiveness of the business model built under the leadership of Jason Les is not high, since the company has not sold Bitcoins in the volumes that have been in recent months. So, for example, Riot sold only 200 coins in March 2022, while this value increased by 125% in November 2022, but the price of Bitcoin fell 62.9%. Created by author Conclusion The necessary reforms in the crypto industry may be painful for certain market participants, but in the long run, more investors and traders will be able to trust crypto exchanges more. In addition, I believe in the urgent need to introduce audit control over cryptocurrency developers, as this will show how much and how investor money is spent on project development and improve the investment climate in the crypto community. As a result, more conservative investors from the stock markets will be able to begin to view coins not as just worthless assets, but as something that has the potential to improve certain aspects of people's lives. The crypto miner business continues to suffer from a months-long ""crypto winter"" as the cost of mining Bitcoin exceeds its current price. But even during periods of mass euphoria, when the growth in the price of the most popular coin significantly exceeded the growth rate of the S&P 500 ( SPY ), the EBITDA of one of the industry leaders, namely Riot Blockchain, remained in the negative zone. The key reasons for this can be not only the inefficiency of the business model but also the inability of companies from the crypto industry to increase the hash rate faster than the growth rate of network difficulty. In general, I believe that as soon as news begins to appear signaling a reduction in the Fed interest rate, this will become one of the main triggers that can lead to a significant increase in investment interest not only in cryptocurrencies but also in shares of companies traded with a beta greater than 1 and increased financial ratios. According to my model, the Fed's rhetoric will not begin to soften in the next two quarters, and as a result, I maintain the expectation that the Bitcoin price bottom will be in the $12,700-$13,600 range and will occur in early 2023. However, before that, we are waiting for an increase in volatility in the crypto market, and novice investors should be most careful in making decisions.",NEUTRAL,BTC | BNB,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4565299-bitcoin-how-binance-and-fed-affect-cryptocurrency?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5956204.jpeg

Presently, the entire market looks to be consolidating but Ethereum has been put under some pressure following the activation of two whale addresses. These addresses which had not transacted for about half a decade had suddenly moved tens of millions of dollars worth of ETH between them. Five-Year-Old Whales Move $27 Million In the early hours of Monday, Lookonchain, an on-chain data tracker, took to Twitter to post the re-awakening of long-dormant Ethereum addresses. These addresses both held at least $10 million worth of ETH on their balances and had not seen any type of activity in the last five years, until today. Related Reading: Double-Digit Losses Brings Doge Below Critical Level, More Pain To Follow? Both wallets, seemingly out of nowhere, had first transferred out 1 ETH to a new wallet in what looks like test transactions. What followed was another large transaction that would empty out their balances. The first wallet would transfer a total of 9,877 ETH in a single transaction, worth $11.7 million at current prices, while the second wallet would transfer out a total of 13,103.99 ETH in its second transaction, worth $15.5 million at press time. This brought their cumulative total transactions to more than $27 million. ETH stalls at $1,185 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com All of the ETH was transferred to new, unknown wallets with no prior history besides the 1 ETH test transaction. The ETH is now sitting in these new Ethereum addresses and has not been touched so far. Bad News For Ethereum? The movement of such a large amount of ETH has stopped the digital asset in its tracks. So far, there has not been any meaningful movement in the Ethereum price which shows a lot of wariness on the part of investors and traders alike. However, despite the ETH from these whales being significant, it does not look to have any market impact since the coins were just moved from one storage wallet to another, as it seems. There has been no movement to centralized exchanges, and if this was a sale, it was an OTC trade which eliminates the pressure such a sale would have had on the open market.

42388348,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRETNf,1671467537,Binance Losing Auditing Partner Mazars Leaves Crypto Questions Unanswered,"In the aftermath of cryptocurrency exchange FTX’s collapse last month, questions have swirled throughout the industry about whether other large players’ finances can be trusted. With professional auditors now abruptly exiting the space, those questions may keep lingering.  Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, sought to tamp down worries raised by rival FTX’s rapid descent into bankruptcy court by announcing it would release proof-of-reserves data. While not conventional audits, such reports describe how much crypto an exchange is holding – an attempt to allay fears about the whereabouts of customers’ money.  The Binance proof-of-reserves report did come out – only to be withdrawn Friday when the auditing firm it had hired, Mazars, announced it was no longer working with crypto firms. Mazars had also been working with Crypto.com and KuCoin.  Mazars was one of a few auditors (along with Grant Thornton and BDO) working with unregulated and private companies in the crypto industry to assure transparency. Now even the French auditor has cold feet.  “I’m quite surprised the public and regulators are finally discovering that their favorite centralized exchanges [CEX] have incredibly complicated layers of corporate structures and, as we’re finding out, un-auditable books,” said Joseph Collement, general counsel at Bitcoin.com.  Mazars, in an email to CoinDesk, said it was pausing work with crypto clients globally due to “concerns regarding the way these reports are understood by the public.”  Binance and many other crypto firms are privately held, meaning they don’t regularly – if ever – release financial data. So the short-lived proof-of-reserves information was welcomed by the industry.  The now-withdrawn reports published by Binance and Crypto.com were often misunderstood as actual audits, that is unbiased examinations and evaluation of the financial statements of an organization. But they’re really just a matching exercise that involves mapping customer assets as recorded in an exchange’s internal database to entries in a public blockchain, according to Francine McKenna, a lecturer in financial accounting at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.  This led to confusion in the industry and the assumption that those exchanges indeed had all the assets they said they had – which isn’t necessarily the case, because the exchange could have cherry-picked the assets that were checked by the auditor.  In theory, it’s easy to audit proof of reserves, Collement said. “When a crypto asset is deposited onto an account earmarked for a specific user, the CEX should hold that asset 1:1 on behalf of the user.”  However, very few CEXs adhere to those procedures, he said. “Once commingling of customers’ funds together or customer’s and company’s funds occurs, audits become extremely more difficult.”  This is also because assets could be held in other cryptocurrencies as opposed to U.S. dollars, which adds another layer of complexity. In addition to that, “proof of reserves mean very little without proof of liabilities,” he said.  This is a problem, because while these reports prove there are assets to support the market value of various stablecoins or reserves to back up customer assets, they don’t consider the creditworthiness of borrowers for loans that are included as assets. They also don’t identify and value obligations the stablecoin issuer or exchange may have to others that could wipe out the value of those assets.  “Choosing to do any work, especially an actual audit, with crypto-adjacent firms is very high risk,” McKenna said. “I am not sure these firms fully assessed the risks of acceptance and continuance of these relationships to their reputation and legal liability.”  Crypto companies for a long time have promised customers to publish audits regularly to provide a sense of security and transparency. Few have actually kept their promise, and most have argued that it is simply too difficult to find an auditor to work with.  “Mazars is trying to reduce its risk profile,” said RA Wilson, chief technology officer of 1GCX. “Its team probably discovered that they’re understaffed and not as knowledgeable about the crypto industry as they need to be to conduct a comprehensive audit.”  Mazars’ departure doesn’t mean, however, that conventional auditors cannot examine the books at crypto firms. Coinbase is a publicly traded company in the U.S., and so – as it must – the company releases full-fledged reports about its finances, audited by one of the largest accounting firms in the world: Deloitte.  Top accounting firms like Deloitte “prefer to work with large pre-IPO or public firms,” McKenna said. “Partners who want to do something new or more risky are usually held back by lots of layers of checks and balances that manage liability for the firm.”  Firms like Mazar or Grant Thornton, or Tether’s auditor BDO Milan, on the other hand, have seen an opportunity to carve out a niche in a new industry, she said.  “I think this ‘pause’ by Mazars … will create a chilling effect,” McKenna said. “The fact that FTX had any audits means someone is starting to ask for more assurances. That has now grown to a very loud cry, and I doubt the Big Four [accounting] firms will step in and fill the void.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/19/why-auditors-arent-working-with-most-crypto-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e955b34a0f8ba080fbf243ef625c157c232a8388-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394083,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXFrX,1671467309,"With Binance, Everything Is Not Fine","The current state of Binance can be summed up nicely in meme form:  In reality, everything is most definitely Not Fine.  Back in 2019 – when Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was still golden and FTX was on the up-and-up – Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, invested in the now-defunct crypto exchange’s series A. Last year, it exited that transaction after SBF bought out its stake for $2.1 billion.  That $2.1 billion payment, according to Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, was received through a combination of BUSD, BNB, FTT and IOUs (presumably – only half-kidding).  Genevieve Roch-Decter is the CEO of Grit Capital and writer of a finance newsletter on Substack.  In an interview this week, CZ told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" anchors that, in fact, a “good chunk” of that payment was received in FTT – which, lest we forget, is now aggressively less valuable than an IOU – and that up until recently he had “actually forgot” about some $580 million FTT that Binance had left over from the transaction.  Coincidentally, his liquidating that FTT was the first domino in this saga, but I digress – is forgetting about over half a billion dollars supposed to make me feel more confident in Binance’s ability to properly run an exchange?  File under ""Not Fine."" ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎  In any case, CZ had better turn his attention to tracking down every last cent of that $2.1 billion because it may be going back.  You see, in the eyes of the bankruptcy proceedings, transactions made by FTX to outside entities (like the $2.1 billion payment to Binance) may be considered fraudulent conveyances.  This is just a fancy way of saying it has become a target, which means the bankruptcy court could potentially reach back into the transaction history and pluck (i.e., force Binance to pay back) that $2.1 billion in U.S. dollars, regardless of whether it was originally conveyed in FTT, IOUs or fairy dust – doesn’t matter.  File under ""Not Fine."" ‎ ‎  When CNBC’s Becky Quick asked him point blank if Binance could feasibly cough up such a large amount, CZ responded with the physical manifestation of the meme above, inelegantly fumbling his way to a weak “we’re financially strong.” ‎ ‎  ‎File under ""Not Fine."" ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎  And remember when Binance released proof of reserves last month to calm the market in the fresh wake of FTX’s collapse?

In response, the only thing CZ has offered the crypto community is more red flags: evasive answers full of vague promises about “full audits” with no timelines; verbal assurances that the company is strong without any specific and verifiable evidence to support the claims.  Investors aren’t buying it anymore. Why would they?  One of the biggest concerns is that even if Binance is correctly collateralized, that could change quickly if there’s a run on the bank, or if one of its largest reserve holdings has issues.  This is a classic scenario for crypto exchanges, everything is fine … until it’s not.  If the stablecoins in Binance’s reserves hold to their peg, everything will be fine.  If it can provide true proof of reserves, everything will be fine.  If there’s no run on the bank, everything will be fine.  If it can deliver fully audited financials, everything will be fine.  If the U.S. Department of Justice decides not to strike with criminal charges (something we didn’t even get to in this essay), everything will be fine.  For each day that passes without specific and verifiable evidence to address all its issues, these “ifs” grow bigger for Binance.  Until that happens, everything is Not Fine (and deteriorating).

42407212,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJkPo,1671465581,What Will 2023 Bring for CBDCs?,"Since 2021, many governments have been ramping up their central bank digital currency (CBDC) efforts.  Moving from deliberation to the experimentation phase, central banks are actively building capacity to deliver next-generation payment systems backed by their governments. With growing competition from global digital assets, a CBDC is a central bank’s vehicle to re-establish its role in a country’s monetary system.  Lipsa Das is a freelance crypto writer and strategist based in India. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.  A quick overview of CBDC global adoption rates  According to the Atlantic Council think tank, over 100 countries are actively exploring CBDCs in the research and development phase. Eleven countries have launched their CBDC programs, including Jamaica, Nigeria and the Bahamas. Many countries are in the pilot phase, such as China, India and Thailand.  Notably, China has had the most success with its digital yuan, with transactions surpassing $14 billion, although overall volumes have slowed significantly from a record 154% growth in transaction volume in 2020 to just 14% since the end of 2021.  Finally, some countries, including Ecuador and Denmark have explored the possibility of launching CBDCs but have since paused their efforts.  The newest entrant to the CBDC race: India  India’s pilot launch of its e-rupee has sparked global interest. As the largest democracy in the world with a massive crypto user base, India is the perfect testing ground to implement a large-scale CBDC campaign.  Its direct competitor, UPI – India’s current digital payments system – has onboarded over 376 banks and currently processes monthly transactions of over 119 lakh crore ($1.4 trillion), a solid foundation to build digital currency infrastructure.  Currently, the e-rupee pilot is restricted to bankers and select retail customers. Considering India’s G-20 presidency, its stance on CBDCs and the performance of e-rupee have the ability to influence the other 18 G-20 countries on their own potential CBDC rollouts.  Future of CBDCs: Predictions and areas of improvement  CBDC adoption woes  Despite the widespread enthusiasm among governments and central banks, the adoption of existing digital currency projects has been lukewarm. There are several barriers to adoption working against CBDCs.  As the International Monetary Fund (IMF) states in its paper on instant payments, from a consumer point of view, there is little difference between instant payment systems and CBDCs since both are fast, backed by the central government and free of charge.  Thus, CBDCs need to provide tangible benefits for users to switch from an already working system. For instance, India’s e-rupee plans to target those who don’t have bank accounts, in contrast to UPI, which enables bank-to-bank transfers. Further, UPI doesn’t permit cross-border transactions, but CBDCs can potentially tackle this issue once a global standard is established.  We will also see widescale incentivization and marketing campaigns to boost CBDC adoption. These could range from free money and tax benefits to foreign transaction fee waivers and public sector salaries paid with CBDCs.  However, in countries with more restrictive financial laws, incentivization might look very different, sometimes infringing on basic human rights. For instance, Nigeria plans to ban ATM cash withdrawals over $225 a week, with exceeding amounts attracting a 5% processing fee. This is a clear attempt to boost Nigeria’s cashless policy and the lackluster adoption of its CBDC, eNaira – which has an adoption rate of just about 0.5% of the country’s population.  Countries that follow China’s example (where cryptocurrencies are banned) could potentially pose considerable restrictions on cryptocurrencies and stablecoins to boost CBDC adoptions.  A continued focus on CBDC technology  Designing a financial system for an entire country is a massive undertaking. Unsurprisingly, there have been multiple technical roadblocks along the way as governments roll out their centralized digital currencies.  One banker told Reuters earlier this month that India’s e-rupee is, at the moment, “more inefficient” than traditional banking. Bulk trade settlement, paperwork reduction and other systems must be introduced to entice banks to keep using e-rupee. Additionally, CBDC trade volumes need to exceed volumes on other payment methods, otherwise it leads to more paperwork for the bank.  Similarly, Nigerian users have found it hard to use eNaira, despite the fact that it is legal tender in the country.  “I've been able to create a wallet [on the eNaira app] and all, but I can't fund it yet as it’s throwing an ‘account not found error.’ The entire experience has been quite frustrating, as the whole thing seems very half-baked,” Yusuf, a programmer and crypto enthusiast in Nigeria, told CoinDesk.  Based on the Google reviews for the eNaira app, this sentiment seems to be uniform across most Nigerian Android users. Nigeria’s plans to encourage a cashless policy when many users can’t even verify their accounts would likely result in a ton of backlash. For CBDCs to stand a fair chance against other payment systems, ironing out these technical details is crucial.  Co-existence of CBDCs, stablecoins and other payment methods  While some may believe CBDCs to be the future of money, the transition to CBDCs will be slow and, most likely, partial. And that’s if CBDCs are even successful.  For instance, according to a Bank for International Settlements (BIS) report, CBDCs could find a use case in facilitating cross-border payments, improving banks' limited operating hours and long transaction chains. Merchants and wholesalers can directly benefit from faster settlement times and less paperwork.  CBDCs also show promise for settling bulk high-value transactions for wholesalers and entities. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R–Wyo.), who has played a significant role in crypto regulation in the U.S., believes that CBDCs should be restricted to wholesale users, central banks and other government entities.  Last month, the U.S. began its 12-week pilot program of the digital dollar with a group of major banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  “I believe that the direct-to-consumer product will actually be stablecoins,” Lummis said in an interview with tech news site Protocol.  Other payment methods such as credit cards and cash will likely co-exist with CBDCs for the foreseeable future, with each catering to a different audience. In advanced economies, where we already see a cash decline, CBDCs could accelerate the process and reduce the need for ATMs. User adoption will be the final judge.  Addressing control over money flow and privacy concerns  One of the primary arguments against CBDCs revolves around data privacy and government control over individual financial assets. These concerns aren’t unfounded: Iran’s threat to freeze bank accounts of women who don’t wear hijabs and Nigeria’s cash withdrawal limits scratch the surface of what kind of control governments could potentially exert with mandated use of CBDCs, such as the removal of e-wallets as punishment.  What happens in the case of a war? Can trade restrictions and financial sanctions extend to government restriction of money between countries with the click of a button?  Democracies such as the U.S. want to distance themselves from the potentially privacy-breaching nature of CBDCs. “[In China], the digital yuan is direct-to-consumer. It's also a means of surveillance. We don't want a CBDC that is dollar-denominated that could be used as a means of surveillance,” said Lummis.  Privacy technologies used to combat CBDC’s privacy issues are expected to become popular among democratic countries that emphasize human rights. India has indicated that it will be looking into integrating its CBDC with privacy-based technologies. How effective these technologies will be and the extent to which they will be implemented by the government remains to be seen.  Further, experts such as Bitget’s Gracy Chen have called for the possibility of CBDCs having multiple permissioned nodes so that a central bank is not the sole authority in a major payments system.  CBDCs across borders  Most countries experimenting with CBDCs are doing so independently. This drives a new problem: Different CBDCs use drastically varied design standards and technologies that are typically incompatible with one another.  Thus, there’s a very real possibility of ending up with the same fragmented, siloed financial ecosystem again, with CBDCs adding to the problem and not solving it.  We’ve already seen this happen with the current cryptocurrency ecosystem. Different blockchains such as Ethereum, Solana and Avalanche have their own ecosystems, which are largely incompatible with one another, except through common points such as bridges or centralized exchanges.  This issue could become even more complicated with CBDCs, which live on private ledgers controlled by governments who usually aren’t very eager to share information with each other.  Some form of standardization is needed to enable smooth, fast, cross-border transactions. SWIFT’s solution of globally interlinking CBDCs is a start, but more collaboration and testing across operational CBDCs is needed.  Banks and fintech providers will have a role to play  CBDCs might weaken the power of the existing financial system – especially banks. According to a BIS report, we risk systemic bank runs if many people rush to convert their money into CBDCs abruptly. However, that doesn’t mean banks and fintech providers don’t have a role to play in the adoption of CBDCs.  Many central banks across the globe are exploring a hybrid model for CBDCs, where the central bank distributes CBDCs to a regulated entity such as a bank or fintech institution. While CBDCs would be regulated and managed by the central bank, intermediary entities would handle the basic checks for know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering and overall transactions.  To achieve this, banks must significantly overhaul their structures and teams. They will need to assess how their existing structures can be upgraded, revamped and integrated with CBDC technology, and bank staff will need to be trained in the basics of distributed ledger technology. If a bank is responsible for laying the groundwork for a CBDC, it will also need to hire more technical staff.  Further, CBDC onboarding will likely be contracted out to private players, particularly if the country’s banking infrastructure isn’t strong. For instance, Jamaica has partnered with technology provider eCurrency to onboard the country’s financial institutions.  To CBDC or not to CDBC  While still in the development phase, one thing is for certain: There is no one-size fits all approach to CBDCs. China’s success with CBDCs as an authoritarian country compared to Nigeria and the Caribbean’s extremely low adoption rates paint very different pictures.  To truly drive adoption, CBDCs need to evolve and customize strategies based on their customer’s needs and priorities – whether it be privacy, payment system efficiency or cross-border payments.  Most CBDC models are still new, with tepid success in terms of adoption and ease of use. Retail consumers, especially those happy with the existing payment solutions, will be the hardest sector to convince. As eNaira user Owolabi Abdullah told CoinDesk, “Our CBDC doesn’t solve anything. It’s additional stress – I could just have a regular crypto wallet.”  Plus, giving governments more control over their financial assets just doesn’t sit well with most people, unless there’s something in it for them.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Lipsa Das,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/19/future-of-cbdcs-2023-india-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e5ec92d73ea8873718094225acbacedc1a62430-4256x2832.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As of this writing, TRX has gained 0.2% on a daily basis, with a 6.1% increase seen on a monthly timeframe. A recent development might have something to do with this, as it pertained to the TRX environment. According to a tweet, the ecosystem has reportedly passed Binance’s BSC to become the No. 2 cryptocurrency in terms of total value locked. Despite this progress, the price of TRX was rejected at $0.055175, causing a fall to its current market price of $0.053740. The entire locked value of Tron has recently breached $4.30 billion, surpassing BSC by approximately $260 million. #TRON surpasses #BSC to become the 2nd largest chain by Total Value Locked on-chain! @justinsuntron seems to be one of the only people that’s doing well considering the fall of all the heroes of 2021 #TRX #TVL pic.twitter.com/L1I1L50yHE — Intuit Φ (@Intuit_Trading) December 17, 2022 Related Reading: Can Ethereum Prevent More Losses As Altcoin King ETH Slips 7% In Last 7 Days?

This was reflected in the price, as TRX was rejected at $0.055175 on December 18. In addition, Tron’s USDD stablecoin has lately lost its peg. Fears were raised amongst TRX advocates that the network could fail in the same tragic way that Terra did, as a result.

42388346,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRET0H,1671462196,Crypto Trading Protocol Drift Relaunches Into Rocky Solana DeFi Landscape,"As Solana decentralized finance (DeFi) staggers through the rubble of FTX, a long-absent player of its crypto derivatives trading scene is ready to take the stage once again.  Drift, a Solana-based perpetual swaps trading protocol that handled billions of dollars in volume during the 2021-2022 bull run before collapsing during the Terra crash, is going live with its revamped second version on Friday.  Version 2 of Multicoin-backed Drift has bigger ambitions than simply derivatives: It seeks to be a one-stop-shop crypto exchange for all the many transaction types DeFi can offer. Many of those services are in short supply in the Solana ecosystem right now, making Drift’s return a potential bright spot.  The relaunch will test whether Drift’s expanded offerings can overcome the doldrums currently depressing all of Solana DeFi, where decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume has fallen 96% in a single month – the worst of any major chain in reaction to FTX meeting its doom.  Read more: Solana DeFi Sees Almost $700M in Value Wiped Out on FTX Fallout  But it will also measure whether the traders who remain are willing to trust Drift specifically. The protocol only escaped most of the bear market because it was among the first to fail.  Drift is hopeful it will. Buoyed by the “patient” venture backers who bailed it out of its first crisis, and convinced that its novel liquidation tech – the process by which it auto-liquidates people who get margin called – is better than anyone’s, the protocol’s team of over 20 people is now going for the redo, said co-founder Cindy Leow.  At the heart of the revamp is a rather complex method for keeping trades – buying, selling and liquidations of the collateral of levered users whose bets sour – moving. The key has always been limiting slippage, or the difference between a trade’s expected price and the one it actually gets. Big orders can miss their mark badly during market volatility, which is also the time when big liquidations are prone to happen.  Drift’s retooled execution mechanism should cut down on slippage for big trades, Leow said. Instead of solely relying on market-making firms (as centralized exchanges do) or “automated market makers” (AMM, DeFi’s code-based trading engines) to fill buys and sells, v2 sends trades through three layers of liquidity to find the best price.  The first step – called a “just-in-time auction” – sees market makers compete to fill orders. If they pass on a trade, Drift’s AMM will take it. Meanwhile, the protocol’s orderbook is on standby to fill trades when the price is right.  This “liquidity trifecta” is a lot more complex than Drift’s original setup, basically an AMM that processed all liquidations. But the original liquidation setup flopped. Drift v1 imploded during May’s Terra-triggered market collapse; a proverbial “run on the bank” by highly levered traders cannibalized millions of dollars of user collateral.  Drift secured $15 million in emergency financing so it could pay back its users, Leow said. She declined to state the terms or who provided it, but said Drift’s investors were involved. Though team developers quickly patched the bug, the protocol remained offline until November, when mainnet testing for v2 began.  Drift’s torpedoing at the start of 2022’s industry havoc may have actually sheltered it from much of the chaos that tormented other DeFi protocols. Its relaunch comes shortly after FTX’s collapse and a series of exploits felled well-known protocols like Mango Markets and Solend.  “Seeing the attacks made us wait a bit longer,” Leow said, adding that developers spent more time battle-testing the protocol and adding features, too.  Drift v2 is positioned to capitalize on the lack of competition. It plans to support spot trading, borrowing and lending, and asset pool staking in addition to trading perpetual swaps – its original focus.  “Obviously, it's not great that they’re down. We like being in an ecosystem,” Leow said of the competitors. “When we were building this the motivation for us to build borrow and lend and bake that into a perpetual protocol wasn’t to be the only live one.”  A perhaps more existential threat than Drift’s competition is its choice of platform. Solana DeFi was knocked hardest by last month’s disintegration of Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire, especially the death of Alameda Research, a key market maker and one of Drift’s venture backers. The entire ecosystem is now short on liquidity, Drift included.  On Drift v2 “you can’t just yeet a 5-figure position market order like at GMX,” said one v2 beta user, referring to the popular DEX based on Arbitrum. One reason: low liquidity.  Leow said Drift will ultimately go where the traders do – so long as the tech can take the heat. For now, at least, that means Drift’s sticking with Solana.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/19/crypto-trading-protocol-drift-relaunches-into-rocky-solana-defi-landscape,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b44e088c0a617ca5b3d96e753b25323479b46a76-1620x1081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394084,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXFwf,1671462059,Notorious B.I.G. in the Limelight in Metaverse VR Concert Experience,"The spirit of Notorious B.I.G. was resurrected in the metaverse on Friday night, transporting thousands of attendees to a virtual recreation of 1990s Brooklyn, N.Y., for a performance that transcended space and time.  As a native New Yorker and old-school hip-hop fan, my heart swelled when a hyper-realistic digital form of the late rapper in a red velvet tracksuit appeared inside Meta Horizon Worlds, a virtual world experienced through the Meta Quest virtual reality (VR) headset. The immersive concert experience also included a narrative journey through Biggie's – who was born Christopher Wallace – early life and featured guest performances by Sean “Diddy” Combs, The Lox, Latto, Nardo Wick and Lil’ Cease.  The experience was simultaneously broadcast live on the Notorious B.I.G.'s Facebook page, which I was able to view from my laptop. In addition, I used a Meta Quest headset to enter Horizon Worlds to gain access to the full, sensory-laden experience.  In Horizon Worlds, there were about 120 floating avatars gathered in a lifelike concert venue, tuning in from their virtual reality headsets. It was incredible to experience 360 degrees of sights and sounds, though I found the quick movements and flashing lights to be slightly disorienting and was glad to have the ability to watch a recording of the performance, which has since racked up about 68,000 views.  The iteration of Notorious B.I.G. that performed was created by Hyperreal, a digital tech company that is powering ""high fidelity, emotionally real digital twins"" of celebrities, as well as creating immersive virtual environments using VFX technology. ""We started Hyperreal to disrupt the industry and create a new business model for digital humans,"" said Remington Scott, CEO of Hyperreal, who has a long history of pioneering use cases for motion capture technology.  About 20 minutes into the experience, Notorious B.I.G. took to the virtual stage, performing classics including ""Juicy,"" ""Big Poppa"" and ""Warning."" Audible cheers from the audience and a deluge of heart emojis sent in the Facebook chat highlighted the overwhelmingly positive reception to the performance.  The graphics were impressively realistic, though at times the movements of celebrity guests like Diddy felt static and misaligned, reminding viewers that they were, in fact, not real. Accompanied by a full band, the experience still felt rich and even small details like hand gestures, shadows and wrinkles on clothing were carefully considered.  Scott told CoinDesk that Hyperreal teamed up with Voletta Wallace, Biggie's mother, and others who oversee his estate to bring his likeness back to the stage. ""We're creating a digital human that is not just a hologram,"" he said of what led them to virtually resurrect the artist, who was killed in Los Angeles in 1997 at the age of 24.  ""For the last two years, we've been doing tests with the estate, seeing how [the digital Notorious B.I.G.] moves and performs and how real we could get the experience,"" he said.  Several celebrities, including Paul McCartney and Madison Beer, have used Hyperreal to turn their likeness into virtual characters and extend the parameters of their career as the world becomes increasingly digital. ""We're building digital identities for celebrity talent that they own, they can monetize and they control the copyrights,"" Scott said. ""They use these talents, these Hyperreal models, as an interoperable asset across all digital ecosystems.""  Visual effects were also used to bring the late rapper Tupac on stage as a hologram at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2012, though some critics at the time called the performance ""unnerving."" In addition, Tupac's holographic appearance raised questions about the ethics of creating lifelike personas modeled after deceased celebrities.  Scott pushed back at criticism, saying that Hyperreal worked closely with Notorious B.I.G.'s estate and others that knew him intimately.  Ultimately, Scott said that the Meta Horizon Worlds concert experience allowed them to do things that would otherwise not be possible. ""I think it's a fascinating concept,"" he said, ""to be able to go back in time, using the metaverse as a time machine.""

The situation surrounding Genesis Trading, Digital Currency Group (DCG) and Grayscale, which is still unresolved after a month, is depressing the market sentiment around Bitcoin. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, information has now leaked out again which might be a double-edged sword for investors. Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said the company would explore new options to return a portion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s capital to shareholders, as the GBTC currently trades at a record 49% discount to net asset value (NAV). That option is up for debate if the company fails to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange-traded fund, according to a letter to investors. Related Reading: Binance Controversy Continues As Experts Warn Of Serious Fallouts Due To FUD As reported by WSJ, the option could include a tender offer for up to 20% of the trust’s $10.7 billion outstanding shares. A tender offer would be a direct appeal to shareholders to sell their shares at a specified price within a specified time period. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has repeatedly rejected Grayscale’s applications to convert GBTC into a spot ETF, which is why Sonnenshein may now be considering the move. In June, Grayscale sued the SEC just hours after its ETF application was rejected. Last week, the SEC responded to the lawsuit for the first time, reiterating its position in a filing. Grayscale accuses the SEC of double standards by allowing futures ETFs on the market and repeatedly rejecting proposals for ETFs that invest in spot Bitcoin. The SEC’s rationale is that futures ETFs are closely monitored by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs lack this level of government oversight, the plea states.

But the breakup of GBTC, which holds more than 643,000 BTC, is among investors’ biggest concerns. Meanwhile, Sonnenshein emphasized: Grayscale products, including GBTC, remain safe, secure, and unencumbered. We remain steadfast in our belief that the conversion of GBTC to an ETF is in the best interest of investors, and we remain 100% committed to that endeavor. Bitcoin Price Sits Above $16,700 Despite the news, the Bitcoin price held steady above $16,700 at press time. As recently as Friday, the broader crypto market experienced a sell-off after rumors surfaced that DCG might sell assets such as NEAR, Filecoin, and Ethereum Classic on a larger scale. However, apart from falling prices, there was no evidence to back this up. Nevertheless, there were some crypto Twitter analysts speculating about a sell-off by Grayscale’s parent company. Several crypto coins related to Barry Silbert's DCG have been selling off aggressively this evening (FIL, ZEN, ETC, NEAR), leaving many speculators to wonder whether the selling is derived from DCG itself. pic.twitter.com/M9mkQrEI7q — Will Clemente (@WClementeIII) December 16, 2022 At press, the Bitcoin price was sitting at $16,720. Thus, BTC is at a critical level. Bitcoin needs to break through $16,900 and start a continuation to above $17,300.

42407207,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJkCa,1671461226,23 Blockchain Predictions for 2023,"Since 2016 I have ended each year with predictions for the blockchain ecosystem for the year ahead. 2022 has been one of the most tumultuous years in crypto, with a litany of decentralized and centralized entities already evaporated or on their last leg. It feels like we are in the final convulsions of a nascent ecosystem, expelling bad actors and bad practices in a dramatic but ultimately maturing process. Here’s what we’ll see on the other side.  Andrew Keys is a venture capitalist and managing partner of DARMA Capital, a Commodity Futures Trading Commission-registered commodity pool operator and commodity trading adviser focused on quantitative systematic alpha of Web3 protocols. Prior to DARMA Capital, he was global head of business development for ConsenSys.  1. Ethereum momentum  When we look back at 2022 in 10 years, the real news wasn’t the idiocy of Sam Bankman-Fried and Celsius Network; it was that Ethereum shipped proof-of-stake and continues to be the most ubiquitous layer 1. A series of protocol-level developments has created a vortex of innovation, development, users and capital. In Ethereum we are witnessing the evolution of the substrate of humanity’s social, economic and political operating system.  In 2023, Ethereum will continue to be the most widely adopted, widely developed and capital-heavy layer 1 blockchain. The Merge was the greatest event in the industry since Satoshi’s Bitcoin Genesis Block in 2009. More nuanced but equally important developments will launch on Ethereum in 2023, driving greater adoption and capital in a flywheel effect that will situate Ethereum as the leader in the next bull run.  The next Ethereum upgrade after the Merge is Shanghai, planned for the second quarter of 2023. Among many upgrades Shanghai will enable withdrawals of ether (ETH) stakes, which have been locked in the deposit contract since staking was enabled in December 2020. The ability to un-stake ETH could increase the amount of staked ETH as stakers, who were uneasy with the idea of locking funds, come on board.  Following the Shanghai upgrade, EIP-4844 is another Ethereum innovation that will further situate Ethereum as the most ubiquitous layer 1. EIP-4844 will enable proto-danksharding. Proto-danksharding is proposed as a step along the way to full sharding, and will help layer 2s scale. Danksharding is a sharding design that uses a “merged market fee” in which each shard has different blocks, but shares one block proposer.  Read more: What Is Sharding?  EIP-4844 is a proposal to start implementing elements of danksharding as the full danksharding design is still being developed. Though no longer in the Shanghai update, I predict proto-danksharding will be accepted and implemented in 2023, setting the stage for rapid development towards full sharding and maximum Ethereum scalability.  2. Ethereum staking  After a smooth transition to proof-of-stake, Ethereum’s utility as a platform for staking innovation will continue to expand, creating a new compounding crypto yield curve.  Following Ethereum’s successful migration to proof-of-stake in September, ETH is now the largest staked capital base of any blockchain, with more than $20 billion staked. Prior to the Merge, we saw innovation in the realm of staking through projects like Lido, which enables liquid staking, and Obol, which provides distributed validator technology.  In 2023, we will see continued innovation in ETH staking as capital seeks more secure forms of yield and future updates enable stake withdrawals. EigenLayer is a particularly innovative staking project. EigenLayer provides crypto-economic “security as a service” to rollups, bridges and oracles. EigenLayer allows these projects to leverage Ethereum’s staked security to supplement or complement the security provided by a native token. In 2023, EigenLayer plans to launch its re-staking protocol and the first middleware using the re-staking mechanism, called EigenDA (Data Availability).  An increase in ETH staking in 2023 will engender demand for more nuanced utility from validators, stakers, and projects built on Ethereum. Staking innovations like EigenLayer and others will continue funneling utility and capital into the Ethereum base layer, creating a flywheel of adoption and utility that will continue to establish Ethereum as the global settlement layer for Web3.  3. Fed outlook  The Fed will turn dovish, setting the stage for the next crypto bull market in Q3 2023.  I predict the U.S. Federal Reserve will pivot away from its hawkish policy and stop raising interest rates by the second quarter of 2023. As we see credit card debt at notable highs and savings at notable lows, I anticipate we will see macroeconomic indicators like Brent crude oil fall to $60 – early 2021 levels – and shipping container rates fall below $2,000, which hasn’t happened since before COVID-19. Both of these signals indicate an economy in need of jump-starting, which will convince the Fed to ease off the interest rate hikes. This will engender a risk-on environment, incentivizing capital flows into more innovative industries like crypto. By this time, I also predict sufficient regulatory progress will be made in the crypto industry, meaning that the risk-on environment will be accompanied by clearer policies. Altogether, this will engender the next bull run beginning in Q3 2023.  4. Regulations in D.C.  Washington, D.C., will be a crypto hotspot in 2023 as regulatory innovation proceeds at unprecedented rates.  The centralized finance disasters of 2022 were the result of poor risk management, insufficient governance, incomplete audits, and potential fraud – all of which could have happened in any industry. Consumer protection will be top of mind for policymakers in 2023. The majority of emerging policy will be around centralized exchanges and stablecoins. Exchanges like Coinbase may be forced to be G-SIFI-regulated institutions, which will increase their regulatory compliance costs. Washington, D.C., will be the hotbed of some of the most controversial and important conversations about crypto in 2023.  During this increase in regulatory attention, the Securities and Exchange Commission will continue to declare that all tokens are unregistered securities, which is categorically untrue. Just because this new database technology is able to digitize and tokenize any asset doesn’t mean all such assets are securities. We will see tokens representing everything: an electron on a microgrid, a bar of gold, a carbon offset credit, a software license, a governance right, a concert ticket, a doctor’s prescription, a meme that got very popular in 2010 and then everyone forgot, a fiat currency, and a reward point – none of which should rationally be lumped under securities. That isn’t consumer protection, [SEC chief] Gary Gensler, it’s willful ignorance of new technologies.  If the U.S. rushes through poorly designed legislation under the guise of consumer protection, we will lose Web3 to the rest of the world – unlike how the U.S. won the Web2 revolution. A regulatory ontology should be defined to help everyone in the space determine whether a specific token should be classified as a commodity, security, or other type of asset.  5. Chartered banks  Banks chartered by the Federal Reserve will offer crypto services.  The Financial Stability Oversight Council aims to further evolve regulations to protect consumers and enable greater technology innovation in an effort to build more robust and secure global platforms.  An example of this is VaultLink, whose Digital Value Transfer Rail enables banks to offer crypto-asset services (custody, staking, exchange), digital value transfers and real-time payments in a regulatory-compliant manner with true supervisory oversight. VaultLink’s 2023 plans are to continue serving as a leading voice on the Federal Reserve’s Working Group while collaborating with the banking agencies to enable crypto services.  6. More NFT utility  NFT utility will grow more nuanced, personalized and commercial as we collectively move past the “jpeg” era. At the same time, blue chip “jpeg” NFTs will be a multi-billion-dollar asset class.  In 2023, the Web3 ecosystem will move past the “jpeg” era of non-fungible tokens that dominated the last two years, represented by 10,000 pfp projects and zero-utility art. The term “NFT” will no longer automatically mean “digital art” as it has, since a variety of use cases will emerge, all using NFTs as the base technology.  Already commercial behemoths like Starbucks are exploring alternative use cases of NFTs. Many more commercial leaders are watching how Starbucks will unfold; if successful, we will see a big bang of major brands releasing NFT rewards points. Web3-native projects such as Mojito have started this evolution, and are already powering both brands and creators that want to explore more personalized utility of NFTs. 2023 will also be the rise of “phygital” where a teenager who purchases a physical pair of Nikes will also have a digital receipt of those sneakers to be digitally worn on their avatar in the metaverse.  This rapid evolution in the true utility of NFTs will force the crypto community to look back critically on the projects of 2021 and 2022. If they haven’t failed already, the vast majority of remaining NFT projects that haven’t evolved utility will join the NFT graveyard. What we’ll find remaining will be the blue chip NFTs that have been acknowledged but largely ignored in the last year – the CryptoPunks of the world.  7. Investment DAOs  Investment DAOs will grow in prominence as decentralized, secure and transparent alternatives to investing through GP/LP venture structures.  Investment decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) will grow in number and in prominence as transparent, auditable, and collaborative vehicles to deploy and allocate capital. Investment DAOs will force a shift in the mindset of financial decision making; instead of relying on the opinions of a few experts, these DAOs will operate based on the consensus of their global memberships via a “wisdom of the curated crowd.” As agile, on-chain entities, these investment DAOs will be some of the earliest players in high-potential investment opportunities, leveling the playing field for the average investor.  Tribute Labs is an investment DAO building machine whose current network consists of 16 investment DAOs ranging across the Web3 landscape with assets under management of over $1 billion. These DAOs have set frameworks that will serve as blueprints for the emerging set of investments DAOs in 2023. Each DAO is limited to 99 members, striking a balance between a diversity of members and the relative ability to make quick decisions and allocate capital efficiently. Tribute Labs will introduce more DAOs in 2023 (AI, DeSci, Urbit and more), continuing to establish best practices and grow the impact of investment DAOs.  Read more: 2023 Will Be the Year of Dapps – Here's What to Expect  8. Filecoin future  Filecoin becomes a fully fledged layer 1 protocol in its own right, paving the way for the world’s largest decentralized data economy.  In 2020, I predicted that IPFS and Filecoin would step into the global spotlight as a viable decentralized solution for data storage. Two years on, the Filecoin network has indeed expanded at breakneck pace, amassing an incredible amount of hardware to the network. It is now the largest decentralized storage network on Earth. More than 4,000 storage providers contribute ~16 exbibyte (EIB) of storage capacity. Client data stored on the network is up 15 times, year to date. That’s enough to store the entire Internet Archive 275 times over. That said, to be competitive with the centralized cloud, Filecoin will need to grow more than 10 times from here – still a long way to go, but a credible path.  The vision for Filecoin has always been larger than storage. The project’s community has a steadfast commitment to the mammoth ambition of building the decentralized infrastructure required to enable programmable storage (via smart contracts), retrieval and large scale computation of data. In other words, Filecoin is enabling open services for data.  The protocol is releasing smart contracts in Q1 2023 through the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), a critical on-chain upgrade which will allow it to come into its own as a fully fledged layer 1 protocol. The FVM will enhance the sophistication of Filecoin’s storage services while unlocking a whole new universe of use cases for the Web3 space. To date, other layer 1 smart contracts have focused on a few use cases: decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, gaming and so on. What makes smart contracts on Filecoin unique is the ability to pair these Web3 offerings with real world services like storage and compute, provided by an open market. I expect the Web3 space to eagerly anticipate the “coming of age” of Filecoin and explore building natively on the protocol next year.  9. Web3 reputation  Reputation will re-emerge as a fundamental innovation in Web3 as a multitude of reputation projects launch.  In 2023, years of progress on the decentralized identity and reputation front will finally come to a head. These systems will start to become critical pieces of infrastructure underpinning most of our interactions and transactions, especially in Web3. Soon you will be able to take your flawless reputation built on one application and apply it towards another. Decentralized identity and reputation systems make this possible by taking a more holistic approach to identity through platform-agnostic, user-centric data aggregation.  Projects like Intuition are pushing the boundaries on the identity front – by incentivizing the attestation of interesting data points and incorporating these attestations into the “identity” derivation processes, Intuition is able to provide a more comprehensive view of “who” and “what” things are. This is essential in enabling humans to coordinate on a decentralized global scale.  10. ZK everything  Prepare for the rise of “ZK everything” as privacy technology emerges from academic proofs-of-concept to usable, scalable technology.  Zero-knowledge proofs rose to prominence in the past year, with one use case, ZK-Rollups, gaining visibility as the dominant tool for Ethereum scaling. In 2023, a much broader set of use cases will be unlocked by adoption of software development kits (SDK) that allow ZK smart contracts to be programmed into applications (“ZKApps”), executed off-chain, with verification and settlement back on-chain. Off-chain execution opens up a whole new world for data privacy and attestation, and efficiency. It will start to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, and will enable new identity use cases, social networking, voting, games and zkML.  The lynchpin to the success of ZK in 2023 is access to existing Web3 devs. O(1) Labs – company behind the first succinct ZK-based layer 1 MINA – launched an SDK that will better enable the development of in-browser ZKApps in the year to come. These sorts of developments from 2022 will mean that in 2023 ZK will move from the world of academia and testnets into daily Web3 life. Moreover, teams like Matter Labs will roll out zkSync2.0 which is a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine that supports Solidity, Vyper and account abstraction.  The zero-knowledge proving market will be larger than bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) market by 2030.  11. Cosmic Cosmos  Cosmos gets interesting as developers and users seek more customization. Appchains will also go live on Ethereum.  In 2023, the “Cosmos vision” will finally find mass adoption. Cosmos is not a blockchain but a ‘“galaxy” of interconnected chains. Importantly, all of the chains employ the inter-blockchain communication (IBC) standard, a technology designed to mimic the early innovations of TCP/IP layer in Web2. For nefarious hackers, bridges have represented the most lucrative attack vector, totaling a whopping US$2.5 billion since 2020. Having a standard communication layer just makes sense.  Moreover, as blockchains have matured in application, developers will be forced to welcome and own more of the blockchain stack. We will see a range of customizations. How much security does your chain want or need? Is it open for all developers? How about fees? Where do you want to be connected? The many chains approach makes these customizations possible and may unlock true product market fit.  Appchains give developers the ability to customize execution environments in a way that smart contract platforms can’t support. The challenge is that appchains lose the shared security enjoyed by dapps. App-specific rollups (RollApps) get the best of both worlds and will be a big trend in 2023.  Alongside the growth in Cosmos, however, we will see the rise of app-specific chains anchored by Ethereum. As the largest project in the blockchain ecosystem, Ethereum is able to take the best in open-source, and port it to the Ethereum community.  Projects like Stackr Network are pioneering this wave of appchains through RollApps. Stackr offers a language-agnostic SDK for developers to customize optimistic rollups along with a decentralized sequencer network to run them in a trust-minimized way. The plan in 2023 is to build a developer alpha and onboard early projects. These projects will also help shape the design of the system through a closed feedback cycle.  12. Bitcoin slides  Bitcoin will face headwinds, continue to lose market share and will not lead the next bull market.  Bitcoin will continue falling behind in the market as it succumbs to prevailing headwinds: primarily “pet rock” syndrome, environmental concerns and failure as “digital gold.”  Bitcoin’s lack of daily utility will begin working against its favor as the rest of Web3 starts demonstrating real-world use cases. It will succumb to the “pet rock” syndrome, in which holding the asset won’t seem as attractive compared to directing capital to tokens and ecosystems with increasing commercial and enterprise use.  Environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns will only rise with the macro-political and macro-environmental movement. Enterprises, individuals and governments will be under continued pressure to curb unnecessary energy consumption, and crypto is already under scrutiny. Environmental concerns are only one reason why Web3 prefers proof-of-stake, but it is a coincidence that will make PoS blockchains more resilient against ESG criticisms and regulation. Any remaining PoW chains must demonstrate clear utility to validate continued energy consumption. Bitcoin won’t transition to PoS and its utility will remain limited, setting it up to be the primary recipient of such criticism.  Lastly, bitcoin had every chance to act as a risk-off digital gold-like hedge but failed to live up to that opportunity over several years. It acted like risk-on tech beta instead.  Together, these three headwinds will put Bitcoin back even further in this bear market, setting the stage for another layer 1 with actual utility to lead the next bull run.  13. Web3 gaming  Web3 gaming will move past its flawed, early projects and finally begin meeting gamers where they are.  Web3 gaming has, for the most part, fallen short of its vision so far. The most “successful” Web3 games – for instance, Axie Infinity and DeFi Kingdoms – have been propped up as the future of gaming, but have failed to make an impression among the 3 billion gamers worldwide. In fact, Web3 gaming has received a bad reputation, characterized as little more than a money grab or DeFi with a veneer. This reputation has not been improved because Web3 gaming projects are highly connected to crypto markets.  In 2023, Web3 gaming will shake off the habits of these earliest projects and start releasing projects that bring together the utility of Web3 and the aesthetics of traditional gaming. The next wave of Web3 games will look nothing like the Axie-style games of the last two years, and will begin resembling mainstream gaming aesthetics. Popular attention will shift away from token-first projects like Axie towards the studios, companies, and titles that have been building with a gameplay-first approach: Horizon, Animoca and others.  14. Layer 2  As layer 1 protocols continue to undergo core developments in scalability and privacy, layer 2s will support the next wave of consumer-friendly applications.  Despite breakneck innovation, the leading layer 1s still have sufficient protocol-layer development to undergo in order to support daily mass adoption of Web3 applications. Specifically, consumer requirements like scale, user experience (UX), confidentiality and security. The layer 2 ecosystem has been growing steadily over the past 18 months, with generalized networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism, and industry-specific networks including ImmutableX. The layer 2 ecosystem has had a couple of false starts but in 2023 we will see layer 2s come to the forefront of crypto adoption as they handle the wave of consumer applications coming to market. In particular, the nonfinancial applications like social media, gaming, and metaverses – which can reasonably prioritize scale over all else – will look towards layer 2s as the best solution to quickly launch in the market.  Read more: Crypto 2023 – Full coverage  15. DeSci  Decentralized science (DeSci) will take center stage as another major use case of Web3, open-source collaboration and decentralized fundraising. DAOs will be at the forefront of the movement.  In 2023, DeSci will turn scientific research into a Web3-native asset class through IP-NFTs (Intellectual Property NFTs), ushering a new age of scientific discovery comparable to the enormous breakthroughs witnessed in open source software development in the early 2000s. Fields like biotech will move from monopolistic innovation models to open-source, hyper-collaborative ecosystems where outcomes are more fundamentally aligned with patients and researchers.  In 2022, organizations such as Molecule have brought IP from leading universities across the globe on-chain, financed and supported by novel decentralized biotech organizations, such as VitaDAO. VitaDAO is a BioDAO on Ethereum building a portfolio of longevity assets and working to bring these technologies to market in a community-driven way, like a FlamingoDAO for biotech. BioDAOs are communities that fund and incubate IP-NFTs, and are already seeing traction, with four new entities participating in a new accelerator program, bio.xyz.  2023 will continue the rise of BioDAOs and IP-NFTs, as Fortune 500 organizations like Pfizer expand to cover more scientific fields and therapeutic areas.  16. Zombie chains  The remaining vaporware blockchains will finally lose their positions as “top” blockchains as even speculative money leaves their ecosystems.  For years, vaporware blockchains like EOS and Cardano have remained among the “top” blockchains as measured by market cap (Cardano is in the top 10, EOS is in the top 40). These projects are still riding off of hype from their earliest days, having undergone almost no ecosystem development despite the breakneck innovation happening across the rest of Web3.  In the current depth of the bear market, Ethereum is maintaining (roughly) $1 billion in volume every 24 hours. Compare that to Cardano’s ~$1M and EOS’ ~$100,000 daily volume. The bear market hasn’t been kind to any network, but EOS has the unique standing of being responsible for the greatest value destruction based on original fundraising against current value, at $4.2 billion lost. Neither chain is living up to the promises made to early consumers. In 2023, even pre-initial coin offering institutional investors and the earliest retail investors will lose interest. The death knell will toll for these vaporware blockchains as they finally lose the last remaining mainstream supporters under the undeniable lack of on-chain adoption.  17. Decentralized identity  The growth in reputation projects, social networks, and decentralized identity will bring AML/KYC solutions down to the wallet level.  In 2022, a number of tools emerged that explored the ideas of social networks, reputation, and decentralized identities. These projects included soulbound tokens, ENS, POAPs and Lens. This focus on reputation and identity will increase in 2023, alongside increased regulation and consumer protection for DeFi use (at least in the U.S.). Verifiable credentials will become the data standard for off-chain credentials and attestations, with a focus on free, cheap, and privacy-first options that can be selectively disclosed by users. Where will these solutions come to head? We will see the first iteration of scalable reputation systems built using tools such as MetaMask Snaps, DIDs and VCs.  18. The crypto contagion isn’t over  Prepare for more fallout.  The turmoil we’ve seen in crypto since May 2022 isn’t over. There are still buried bodies to be found from the excesses and impulses of the past years. Many people and companies have succeeded in obfuscating their exposure, but won’t be able to do so for much longer. Ultimately good for the ecosystem, this will unfortunately mean more consumer money will be lost, more trust betrayed and greater outside criticism. Keep building for the future, but prepare for more fallout in the near term.  19. Open-source development  In 2023, renewed attention will be paid to leading open-source development projects as a hedge against repeating past mistakes in crypto.  2022 was a massively formative year for open-source, internet-native organizations. The breadth and scale of problems that the Web3 community chose to tackle using these new models grew by an order of magnitude, and the impact these organizations can make for everyday people is starting to become a major theme.  As we’ve learned from cases like FTX, it’s far too easy for us to slip back into old habits and accidentally reinvent the same broken systems that centralize power rather than push it to the edges. In 2023, we’ll see more projects come to the conclusion that we need to take our own rhetoric seriously and start to make meaningful strides towards building open-source, community owned infrastructure; towards a world where digital public goods for any local online community can be provisioned in a mutualist way that strengthens trust rather than diminishing it or abstracting it. Two projects in particular will continue to define models of open-source funding and development: Gitcoin and Tea.xyz.  Gitcoin – which has distributed over $72 million in grants – is launching a “grants suite” that will enable any group to seamlessly empower their community members to coordinate funding for projects that address their shared needs. The suite will consist of Passport – a zero-knowledge identity verification tool – and two new protocols: a funding allocation protocol and project registry protocol.  Tea is a protocol that allows open-source developers to be remunerated for their contributions. Tea’s product suite includes a virtual environment manager, a universal interpreter, and a unified dependency manager. In the first month of launching its command-line interface, over 2,400 developers have starred in Tea's GitHub repository, making Tea’s community of over 16,000 developers one of the most rapidly growing groups on GitHub. In 2023, Tea will be building out its blockchain registry, license management and remuneration features.  20. No more gods  The media will abandon its search for gods and find rational voices in crypto.  As major centralized finance (CeFi) and DeFi projects collapsed in the last year, so too did their founders and CEOs. These individuals had been ravenously propped up by the media, engendering misplaced trust by investors, companies and regulators. The media will need to face its misguided obsession with their crypto “gods” and seek out measured, rational voices in crypto. This will happen, slowly but surely, throughout 2023 as the true nature of more “gods” are revealed.  Fortunately, these rational folks won’t be hard to find for those genuinely interested in reporting on the reality of crypto. These new and old voices – notably humbler than the ones of the last two years – are building for the long term, and should be at the forefront of how the media reports on the space.  21. Tech crypto  “Tech crypto” will become useful, replacing “money crypto” and setting the stage for the next bull market.  In Bill Hughes’ November CoinDesk op-ed, he explains the difference between “tech crypto” and “money crypto.” Tech crypto is about “peer-to-peer computer networks where participants transact by interacting with globally accessible software.” Money crypto is about “buying, holding, lending and trading tokens as investable assets.”  The past year has been dominated by money crypto in terms of popular adoption, regulatory attention, and consumer knowledge. Centralized exchanges have been the “beating heart” of money crypto, and the landscape of CeFi now has a microscope on it from regulators. The scrutinization of money crypto will result in the clarification of tech crypto as a related, but separate, field.  Tech crypto in 2023 will become more and more useful through two trends: 1) the movement of capital from centralized to decentralized financial applications and 2) the rise of non-financial decentralized applications like DeSci, social media, consumer rewards and more. The result will be a growing foundation of Web3 (i.e., tech crypto) adoption rather than just token (i.e., money crypto) adoption. This will set the stage for the next bull market and help hedge against volatile market cycles in the future as more capital is kept in transparent financial applications rather than shadowy centralized alternatives.  22. Enterprise ethereum  The “Great Decoupling” will accelerate, paving the way for stronger enterprise adoption of Ethereum.  In 2023, we will see the “Great Decoupling” and the consequent acceleration of enterprise adoption of Ethereum. As explained by Paul Brody, the Great Decoupling is when “the value proposition of Ethereum as a computing platform for enterprises finally gets separated from the focus on the price of Ethereum and financial speculation.” The focus on Ethereum’s enterprise utility will unlock greater enterprise innovation, spearheaded by organizations like EY building privacy technology on Ethereum. EY (Ernst & Young) now has industrial privacy solutions that support complex business logic, payments and transfers that run on public Ethereum. In the coming year, while enterprises can expect to see demand for audit and risk management go up, they can also expect to see growth in supply chain, procurement, and carbon traceability applications.  23. DeFi is different  The world will understand the difference between CeFi and DeFi.  The only creditors made whole during the disasters of 2022 were Ethereum-based smart contracts, like those on Aave, where Celsius and Alameda Research repaid their loans to access collateral they posted to borrow dollars. Smart contracts didn’t need to retain Kirkland & Ellis or John Ray III for their reorganization, there was no negotiation and the technology worked transparently without fail as intended. The macro consequence of all this for 2023 will be a greater understanding – by individuals, financial institutions, investors, and regulators – of the difference between CeFi and DeFi. The former is where transactions are subjectively intermediated by humans who are able to improperly tamper with the database. The latter are where transactions are trustlessly and objectively intermediated by math and computer science without manipulation.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Andrew Keys,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/19/23-blockchain-predictions-for-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bbae3013aec41dc1b820ddab9673ff0b3f69df9d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

5947273,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512892,1671459737,Can Ethereum Prevent More Losses As Altcoin King ETH Slips 7% In Last 7 Days?,"Further pain was inflicted on the markets as major cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum slipped on macroeconomic pressures and other factors. As of time of writing, the top altcoin Ether has lost nearly 7% in the weekly timeframe. This is reflected in the other altcoins as most, if not all, move alongside ETH. However, if the crypto slides further downwards, will it deal a heavy blow on the broader market as well? Related Reading: Uniswap Stuck In The Ground As UNI Copes With Falling Network Activity The FTX Shockwave Still Felt Since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, Ethereum has been in the red, but then that seems normal as other cryptos are, as well. The decline in ETH’s value, however, began after it reached a record high of $4,635 in December of last year. Since then, the crypto has had massive highs and lows, but mostly the latter. With Ethereum network fees plummeting to $2.9 million per day from $12.8 million on June 13, the price of ether plunged. The total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum-based smart contracts were also down by 4.5% in the last 24 hours. Other Factors At Play For ETH More suffering has been inflicted on ETH as a result of recent occurrences. For instance, the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates last week took a toll on its price, allowing the bears to continue testing the present support price range of $1,164. Further market pain is to be predicted if the coin breaks its current support. The bulk of altcoins on the top 10 list of Coingecko are heavily correlated to ETH, so this is significant for the altcoin market. Thus, if ETH declines, other cryptocurrency holders may interpret this as a sign of market weakness, resulting in greater market misery. ETH is trading at $1,184, down 0.2% in the last 24 hours.

Ethereum may have difficulty retaining investors if further rate hikes occur at the beginning of the first quarter of next year. Despite the fact that the altcoin is down 7% in the last seven days, we expect to see a slight bullish pullback so that we may once again test the $1,222 level as resistance. Currently, the prior price fluctuations of the token indicate that a recovery is forming. However, this is counterbalanced by negative macroeconomic causes and a very pessimistic market mentality, which is a continuation of the bear market that preceded the current events. Investors and traders should be cautious as the current market volatility might invalidate long positions in the short-term.

Focusing on storage and usage within an organization and augmenting standard information security practices, the certification was created specifically for the crypto industry. For example, it analyzes how a provider generates keys, the hardware it uses and how the policy and workflow engine works, as well as the cybersecurity controls used.  Fireblocks received a level three certification – the highest there is – and the one most suitable for enterprises. To win the level three standard, “multiple actors are required for the all-critical actions, advanced authentication mechanisms are employed to ensure authenticity of data, and assets are distributed geographically and organizationally,” according to accounting firm Deloitte.  Fireblocks is the first company to meet all requirements for this level.  “An in-depth and rigorous audit was conducted of Fireblocks’ people, processes, and technology components for compliance with the CCSS and found that Fireblocks went above and beyond the CCSS Level 3 requirements,” said Marc Krisjanous, the CCSS auditor who led the exam.  The CCSS was built in 2014 but no company in the crypto industry has so far met the necessary standards to receive it. Specifically, startups in the space don’t follow security best practices and every system that was subject to breach in the past didn’t pass level one of the standard, Deloitte said.  “I think the reason why we were able to be the first one to get this certificate – we got it within four months of intensive interrogation – is the expertise that we have from working with leading banks that already took us through a very similar process previously,” Michael Shaulov, co-founder and CEO of Fireblocks, said.

Here is a chart that shows how the price of the asset has changed in the last five days: The value of the crypto seems to have gone down recently | Source: LTCUSD on TradingView As the above graph displays, it was only a few days ago that Litecoin was still above the $75 level. The coin had been consolidating between this level and $80 since the last week of November, but now this sideways trend seems to have fully broken down as the coin has rapidly dropped in value during the last few days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prints Bearish Technical Pattern, Why It Could Continue Lower The asset has now lost the $65 level, which means it has almost entirely retraced the gains of the 22 November rally. As it currently stands, LTC is down almost 15% during the past week. For comparison, Bitcoin and Ethereum are only down 1% and 4%, respectively, in the same period. In terms of monthly returns, Litecoin holders are still in a profit of about 2%. The coin is still in the green for this period thanks to the strong November rally, which some thought would lead to a pre-halving bull run for the coin, as its halving, an event where its block production rate will be cut in half, is scheduled for next year. As it turns out, this rally wasn’t what some believed it would be, since LTC has already lost most of its gains. LTC Is Now Below Shiba Inu (SHIB) In Market Cap As a result of Litecoin’s recent sharp downtrend, the cryptocurrency’s market cap has rapidly gone down. Since its competitors haven’t seen losses to such a degree, LTC’s market cap has seen a relatively sharper decline, leading to it dropping spots on the top cryptocurrency list based on market cap.

Alegre will replace Nicole Muniz, who joined Yuga Labs as CEO in September 2021. Muniz will stay on as a partner and strategic adviser.  Under Muniz, the company has grown its portfolio of non-fungible token (NFT) projects, acquiring Meebits and CryptoPunks from Larva Labs in March and Beeple’s Web3 ecosystem WENEW and its flagship NFT project, 10KTF, last month.  In March, Yuga Labs raised $450 million led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), reaching a $4 billion valuation.

Alegre's gaming expertise will amplify Yuga's new efforts to build an interoperable, gamified metaverse world called The Otherside, which ran a successful ""First Trip"" in July for thousands of holders of its Otherdeed NFTs linked to virtual land ownership. The narrative-driven platform, which allows participants to turn their NFTs into playable characters, teased a continuation of its storytelling in Q4.  Yuga Labs has developed a passionate community of NFT holders, offering them long-term utility, surprise airdrops and full intellectual property (IP) rights over their characters for commercial purposes – paving the way for food trucks, music groups and beverage companies emblazoned with Ape branding.  Making the move official, Alegre chose Mutant Ape #3850 as his new profile picture (PFP), reflecting his evolving identity in Web3.  ""Ownership and identity in the digital world is the next frontier for the internet, and something we need to get right,"" Alegre said. ""Yuga is at the forefront of such innovation.

If passed, the proposed Investments and Securities Act, 2007 (Amendment) Bill, will also define supervisory roles for the Central Bank of Nigeria and the country's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with respect to digital currencies, Babangida Ibrahim, chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Capital Market and Institutions, told Punch.  Ibrahim did not specify a timeline for the passing of the bill.  Nigeria banned institutions from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions back in 2017. The SEC clarified in May that it saw digital currencies as securities that represent assets such as debt or equity claims on the issuer.  ""It is not that they are illegal but we don’t have regulation for them. So, these are some of the reasons why we need to review the Act and put some regulations for most of the activities – derivatives, commodity exchanges, digital currencies and so many other things,"" Ibrahim told Punch.

5935487,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512858,1671445848,Binance Controversy Continues As Experts Warn Of Serious Fallouts Due To FUD,"Binance rumors were the all-dominant topic last week after the FOMC meeting. Rumors of insufficient proof of reserves and the pullback from accounting firm Mazars, allegations of a bank run and insolvency, as well as CZ’s interview on CNBC have dragged the Bitcoin and crypto sentiment and prices down. Charles Edwards of Capriole Investments pointed out in a Twitter thread that this “FUD is really bad for the industry,” pointing out that there is “nothing” backed by data that is legitimately worrisome, “but when fear is great enough, it doesn’t matter.” “If current withdrawal rates continue, expect more exchanges to go down – not from poor practices – but bankruptcy,” Edwards contended. Is The Binance FUD “Thinly Veiled Xenophobia”? The analyst suggests that all exchanges are being hit extremely hard by current market conditions. They have to deal with a price drop of more than 80%, a drop in trading volumes of more than 90% and a reduction of reserves by more than 50% “due to irrational panic.” As Edwards analyzes, even the U.S. exchanges Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken have been hit badly. They are currently experiencing a 60% drop in their Bitcoin reserves over the past year. Addressing Bitcoin maxis, in particular, Edwards said: I love Bitcoin. But the maxis screaming for cold storage only, don’t realize that if everyone actually went to cold storage, your precious Bitcoin price would approach $0. Influencers spreading FUD are literally damaging the industry & their net worth just to pump engagement. At the same time, Edwards emphasized that his opinion on Bitcoin has not changed. He said the current price movement is largely fueled by panic. Still, Edwards spoke from the heart of many crypto enthusiasts when he turned to Changpeng Zhao and said: And CZ, let’s stop dilly dallying and put this issue to bed with a _real_ audit. Edwards was joined by market analyst Alex Kruger, who denounced the people who view bank runs as healthy stress tests. Those people “clearly haven’t thought this through. When funds leave, trading activity diminishes, and so do trading fees. And then, many funds never come back.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Plummets Below $17,000 After Audit Firm Mazars Pauses Work For Binance Ryan Selkis, the founder of Messari, claimed much of the Binance FUD is “thinly veiled xenophobia.” Selkis also added: “I’m all for the stress test on deposits and think it’s bad that such a high percentage of volumes runs through a single exchange. I also don’t love the tone of some of the critiques. Sorry!” Notably, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant recently conducted an analysis of Binance’s reserves. The company’s data shows that the amount of BTC Binance said it held as liabilities at the time the PoR report was conducted is consistent with CryptoQuant’s reserve data. Conclusion: Our analysis should not be interpreted as a favorable opinion of Binance as a company or the BSC/BNB networks. Our data merely shows that the amount of BTC Binance says it holds as liabilities at the moment the PoR report was conducted matches our reserve data. — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 15, 2022 Why Doesn’t Binance Take A Big Four Auditor? In Friday’s much-discussed interview on CNBC, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said that “Big Four” auditing firms are currently unable to conduct an audit for a cryptocurrency exchange. The hosts then countered that Coinbase is working with Deloitte. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prints Bearish Technical Pattern, Why It Could Continue Lower Blockworks was told today by a Binance spokesperson that the “Big Four” audit firms – famously Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers – are “not currently prepared” to conduct a proof-of-reserves audit for a private crypto company.

42388353,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRETl3,1671445562,Crypto Options Market Has Become More 'Interdealer' Since FTX's Blowup: Paradigm,"The collapse of Sam-Bankman Fried's digital assets exchange, FTX, has had industry-wide ramifications, one of them being market makers increasing their share of crypto options trading volumes.  As of Friday, the notional value of the month-to-date interdealer flow on the institutional-grade, over-the-counter (OTC) communications platform Paradigm was $633 million, or 43.5% of the total crypto options trading volume of $1,455 million. That's the highest since at least January this year.  ""More buy-side takers (hedge funds/family offices/HNW) are sitting on the sidelines, and a higher proportion of Paradigm volumes is occurring between market makers,"" Paradigm tweeted, adding that the options market fells more ""interdealer"" than before FTX's meltdown.  An options trade is said to be an interdealer trade when both the price taker and the price maker are market-making firms, that is entities with a contractual obligation to maintain a healthy level of liquidity on an exchange. Trading between dealers or interdealer trading is a common feature in most financial markets, particularly those dominated by institutions dealing in large orders.  Price makers create orders and wait for them to be filled. In other words, they bring liquidity to the market. Takers remove liquidity from the market by taking available orders.  The crypto market, like traditional finance, comprises the ""buy side"" and the ""sell side."" The buy side invests in assets and includes pension funds, mutual funds, institutional investors, hedge funds and retail investors. The sell side, which includes commercial banks, investment banks, market makers, stockbrokers and other entities, is concerned with creating, promoting and issuing traded securities.  While Paradigm is an OTC communications platform, its fortunes are closely tied to Deribit, the world's leading centralized crypto options exchange by trading volumes and open positions. Trades facilitated by Paradigm are automatically executed, margined and cleared at Deribit.  The interdealer flow as the percentage of total volume on Paradigm has jumped to 43.5% in December from 30.4% in November.  ""This can chalk up to buy-side clients closing books for the year, and still only halfway through the month, but a jump this high suggests a structural change,"" Amberdata's weekly options analytics note published Sunday, said.  The structural change might be attributed to the high degree of uncertainty the collapse of FTX has injected into the market and the unwillingness among retail and investors to keep coins/funds on centralized exchanges.  FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, setting off a chain reaction that took down industry heavyweights like crypto lender BlockFi and brought extra scrutiny on leading exchange Binance and some of the oldest digital assets institutions, like Grayscale. Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent of CoinDesk.

42388349,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRETSL,1671442015,Former BitMEX CEO Sues Crypto Derivatives Exchange for Breach of Contract and Wrongful Termination,"Former BitMEX CEO Alexander Hoeptner has sued the cryptocurrency derivatives platform for $3.4 million for breach of contract and wrongful termination, a court filing shows.  Hoeptner joined the Seychelles-registered exchange in January 2021 at a time when top officers at HDR Global Trading Limited, the owner and operator of BitMEX, were embroiled in a lawsuit that accused the founders of facilitating unregistered trading.  It was previously reported that Hoeptner left the company in October 2022, without further details. Hoeptner now claims that he received a letter of termination citing misuse of funds and failure to perform duties, among other things.  “Such termination is wholly wrongful and without basis,” the court filing said.  According to Hoeptner, BitMEX owes him a total of $3.4 million, including $2.4 million for his second-year bonus and smaller amounts for remaining wages, relocation expenses and housing, the court filing shows.  “At the direction of the founders and the board, I put my personal and family lives on hold in order to be on the ground managing operations in Singapore and Hong Kong,” Hoeptner told CoinDesk. “I’m disappointed that it has gotten to the point that legal proceedings are necessary, but I’ve been left with no choice.”  Hoeptner relocated several times during his time as the CEO of BitMEX, filings show, and split his time among Hong Kong, Germany and Singapore.  “There were no objections and/or concerns raised as to the Claimant’s relocation and/or the costs that was to be incurred by the HDR Group in respect of the same,” the filing says.  But sometime in July 2022 to August 2022, he was informed by the company that there was a possibility he wouldn’t receive his second-year bonus or any reimbursement for his relocation, citing “extensive cost-cutting and restructuring program which involved numerous layoffs.”  His relocation expenditures at that point had amounted to $230,000, according to the filing. A few weeks later, he received a termination letter.  “We had made tremendous progress – hitting every milestone we set out – which made my wrongful termination even harder to understand,” he said.  A BitMEX spokesperson told CoinDesk the exchange is unable to make any substantive comments at this stage as the matter is pending before the Singapore Court but that it will respond to Hoeptner's claims. ""Needless to say, we will defend the claim vigorously,"" the spokesperson said.  The crypto exchange recently cut its workforce by 30% as it tries to pivot back to its initial focus on derivatives trading. Earlier this year, BitMEX’s former CEO, Arthur Hayes, was sentenced to two years of probation after pleading guilty to charges of willfully failing to implement an anti-money laundering (AML) program at the exchange.

FIL is down 28% over the past five days, with STORJ down 20%. Both have underperformed ether (ETH), which is down roughly 10% during the same time period.  Data from CoinGlass points to record liquidations on long positions for FIL and STORJ as last week came to a close.  Nearly $5.7 million long FIL positions were liquidated on Dec. 16, according to CoinGlass, while $365,000 in STORJ long positions were also liquidated. Internet Computer (ICP), a similar protocol, also had $500,000 in long positions liquidated.  Open Interest data from CoinAlyze suggests the worst is yet to come, with an 11% jump in open interest during the last 24 hours to about $52 million. Continued negative funding rates indicate that this money is coming in to short.  Traders might be questioning the utility of storage protocols, which have a massive – and growing – storage capacity but no obvious use case to utilize it.  Filecoin says it has a capacity of 15.34 exbibytes, or 17.6 million terabytes, but lists storage of OpenSea non-fungible tokens (NFT) as one of its primary clients, raising questions about how much of its storage network is truly utilized.

The U.S. central bank’s campaign this year to squelch soaring inflation by tightening monetary conditions is again becoming top-of-mind for crypto traders, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell and top officials signaling last week that the stiff pressure might remain well into 2023.  “While volatility-crushing fatigue has set in as the Christmas/New year interval approaches, markets will no doubt have to react to this in a bearish way, either with a slow bleed into year-end, or with another January/Q1 sell-off like we saw this year,” the crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Dec. 17 note on Telegram.  Crypto markets were sedate over the weekend and staying flat into Asia trading hours early Monday, with the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) unchanged over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, was changing trading hands around 16,760, up 0.18% over 24 hours.  According to Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at the bitcoin-focused investment firm NYDIG, investors remain “understandably skittish about the practices of exchanges, prop trading firms and lenders” given the industry events of the past six to nine months.  The ongoing pressure from the Fed might “keep a lid on financial assets, including bitcoin, until we get some relief from the monetary policy backdrop,” he wrote in a Dec. 16 newsletter.  Glassnode, the data and analysis firm, noted that “supply and demand dynamics show a lack of activity as investors remain wary following the demise of FTX and the FUD around Binance,” the world’s largest crypto exchange. “FUD” is an acronym for “fear, uncertainty and doubt,” and in the crypto lexicon it refers to pretty much any fresh information that tends toward the bearish side.  “The outlook for bitcoin is not assured for the year-end given the great resistance above $18K, despite the continued seller exhaustion,” according to Glassnode.  Insights  Proof of Reserves is useless without proof of liabilities  By Sam Reynolds  Mazars, the auditing firm working with Binance and other crypto exchanges on proof-of-reserves statements, is pausing its crypto work for the right reason: It's not producing audits, as has been erroneously claimed. But for now, on-chain data is an excellent guide to see who’s really in trouble.  Mazars announced Friday that it’s pausing work for crypto clients because what it’s producing is being misunderstood by the public. Almost immediately, the market panicked, pushing down Binance’s BNB token by almost 10%. It’s since recovered 4.6% over the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.  Mazars is right for doing this. We shouldn’t be calling these reports audits, because they don’t contain a key element for any financial report – liabilities. But we shouldn’t be panicking either, because on-chain data is so far supporting the reported data from Mazars.  There’s a far more interesting metric that we can retrieve via on-chain data that wouldn’t be captured in a Mazars report, which is quality of reserves. And this metric, which measures how reliant an exchange’s reserves are on its proprietary token, shows that Binance doesn’t have the issue some think it does.  Data from CryptoQuant, which pioneered the metric in a recent report, shows that Binance’s reserves are 89% clean.  In contrast, Huobi’s reserves of roughly $3 billion are 56.7% ""clean"", or to put it another way, 43.3% of its reserves are made up of its own exchange token. It's where our attention should be focused now, and not Binance, given that the exchange is the sixth biggest and does around $422 million in daily volume per CoinGecko data.  To be sure, Binance is sometimes its own worst enemy and tends to add fuel to its own fire and encourage conspiracy theories and market panic. Binance is not doing much to help itself by temporarily suspending USDC withdrawals (other stablecoins remained open) and being coy when asked where its controlling company is located.  All this comes as Huobi introduces a new burning mechanism to burn more of its token (think: buyback), thus increasing its value. Huobi’s HT token is down nearly 40% on the year, and it's now priced at $5.46, according to CoinGecko data. In a recent press release, Huobi said there was a 15.94% increase in the number of HT burnt in November compared to October, and this will increase more in the first quarter of 2023.  “Huobi reserves have a highly risky setup at the moment,” Caue Oliveria, one of CryptoQuant’s author-analysts, wrote in a note to CoinDesk. “Tokens issued by the company itself are a risk to the company's net health, since it is difficult to sustain the veracity of the issuance of these coins.”  Oliveria reiterated that FTX’s use of FTT to collateralize loans was one of its causes of failure, and Huobi is playing a dangerous game here.  But CoinGecko co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Bobby Ong's take on the situation is more restrained. He told CoinDesk that we also need to know Huobi’s liabilities to get a proper sense of the situation.  “If the exchange is not using its collateral to borrow money, it doesn't really matter what the clean reserves are. If every customer’s crypto is fully held 1:1 in proper wallets, it doesn’t really matter,” he told CoinDesk via Telegram. “What is more important is knowing the exchange's liabilities amount. Knowing the reserves is one part of the equation, but more importantly, what are the liabilities.”  And those liabilities, for now, are a mystery. Huobi would not respond to emails asking for comment on CryptoQuant’s number or its liabilities by press time. While Huobi has posted its proof of reserves, missing from this report and many other exchange’s similar reports, are its proof of liabilities (hence why Mazars wants out of this business).  “If an exchange has $1 billion in bitcoin liability, it better have $1 billion of bitcoin in cold wallet reserves backing this liability,” Ong concluded.
