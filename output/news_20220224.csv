42395949,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0Ci5,1645745185,"First Mover Asia: India Crypto Firms, Regulators Continue Their Regulatory Debate; Bitcoin Recovers From a Post-Invasion Freefall","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Markets: Bitcoin recovers from its late Wednesday fall, stabilizing above $38,000.  Insights: India passes crypto advertising guidelines and continues its regulatory debate.  Technician's take: There are initial signs of downside exhaustion, although upside appears limited for bitcoin.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $38,202 +2.9%  Ether (ETH): $2,586 +0.2%  Top Gainers  ` Asset Ticker Returns Sector Bitcoin Cash BCH +3.9% Currency Solana SOL +3.8% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin BTC +2.6% Currency`  Top Losers  ` Asset Ticker Returns Sector Internet Computer ICP −4.2% Computing Dogecoin DOGE −4.1% Currency Cardano ADA −3.2% Smart Contract Platform`  Bitcoin's freefall following Russia's invasion of Ukraine halted just below $35,000 during the early hours of Thursday morning. By mid-afternoon, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had regained the perch it has held for much of the week above $38,000.  Trading volume reached its highest volume in a month.  In an email, Oanda Americas Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya wrote that bitcoin was performing like the ""ultimate risky asset, tumbling hard after Russia launched its attack.""  At the time of publication, bitcoin was trading at about $38,200, up about 3% over the previous 24 hours. Ether was roughly flat at about $2,600. Most other altcoins in the top 20 by market cap were in the red, although Terra's LUNA was up over 9%. Solana (SOL) and bitcoin cash (BCH) were also up, albeit less significantly.  Moya said that bitcoin holding ""onto the $30,000 level over the short term would be a good sign, indicating that investors were ""still upbeat about the economic outlook and that risky assets should stabilize once the Russian/Ukraine crisis impact is better understood.""  But he added a more somber note, saying fears of a recession occurring over the next two years ""could trigger many institutional investors to abandon the crypto ship.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,288 +1.5%  DJIA: 33,223 +0.2%  Nasdaq: 13,473 +3.3%  Gold: $1,902 -0.3%  Insights  The Ongoing Debate on Regulation in India  As air raid sirens blared in Ukraine’s capital, India was focusing on evacuating its students from Ukraine. But its crypto-sphere was busy with new advertising guidelines, ongoing discussions between government and industry about taxation, news on why India’s crypto regulation may have been delayed and a day-long conference about non-fungible tokens (NFT).  Advertising  India’s advertising guidelines were highly anticipated because the government had sought to stop misleading ads on cryptocurrencies. Now crypto ads will require a disclaimer saying “crypto products and [non-fungible tokens] are unregulated and can be highly risky.”  “We have not said don’t make crypto adverts, just communicate the risks as much as the good about the product,” said Manisha Kapoor, the secretary general of the Advertising Council of India in a radio interview on Thursday.  Regulation  Formal and informal discussions between India’s crypto industry and the government are ongoing. CoinDesk has learned that after exchange companies met senior officials at a hush-hush gathering at the Indian Finance Ministry a few days ago, more discussions are expected later this week.  On Feb. 1, the government announced new crypto taxation proposals that will become formalized in a few weeks, making this period critical for the industry to seek changes. The new rules include a 30% tax on all crypto gains and 1% tax deducted at source on all crypto transactions.  Meanwhile, Michael Patra, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, has said the central bank's views about cryptocurrencies might have delayed the government's proposed legislation on crypto assets, according to the Press Trust of India, the country’s largest news agency.  NFTs  NFTs had their moment in the spotlight on Thursday. The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), which leads consultations with the government on crypto, held a day-long NFT virtual conference titled “NFT India - A peep into the future of NFT in India.” Indian cricket legend Zaheer Khan and singer Shaan were among the featured speakers. Both stars have dropped NFTs in recent months.  Public interest in the phenomenon has been rising steadily in India as it has elsewhere. The conference addressed this growth and potential opportunities.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Selling Stabilizes; Support at $30K Could Limit Correction  Bitcoin (BTC) extended losses early in the New York trading day and broke below intraday support at $36,500. At press time, the cryptocurrency appears to be stabilizing above $38,000. Resistance is nearby at $40,000, and stronger support is seen at $30,000.  On the daily chart, downside exhaustion signals are starting to appear, similar to what occurred on Jan. 24, which preceded a 30% price jump. This time, however, the relative strength index (RSI) is not deeply oversold, which could delay a potential upswing in price.  Momentum signals remain negative on weekly and monthly charts. That means BTC is vulnerable to further declines. The next two weeks will be critical to determine if buyers have enough conviction to defend the $28,000-$30,000 support zone.

42410908,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtGER,1645744057,Ethereum Gets an Upgraded Scaling Testnet – And It's Actually Years Ahead of Schedule,"zkSync, a protocol responsible for implementing Ethereum scaling platforms, accomplished the unexpected yesterday, announcing the test network release of an Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible Zero-Knowledge rollup (zkEVM) years ahead of schedule.  The EVM is the environment in which all Ethereum wallets and contracts live and is responsible for defining the rules of the chain from block to block. The new test network is the first implementation of a ZK rollup capable of running the full Ethereum environment and will provide great insight into how capable zero-knowledge technology is at scaling blockchains.  Over the past couple of years, Ethereum rollups have taken two different directions in scaling the base layer, categorized as Optimistic and Zero-Knowledge. Both technologies have seen some level of adoption, with Arbitrum being the most notable Optimistic chain and DyDx taking advantage of ZK technology for its leveraged trading application. Like DyDx, ZK rollups have historically focused on offering a single type of application per chain, because the full Ethereum environment that offers customizable smart contracts would be too computationally extensive.  Read more: Ethereum Rollups Aren't All Built the Same  Until now, trade-offs tended to favor Arbitrum and Optimism; now zkSync has the opportunity to level the playing field. Optimistic Rollups are currently able to offer a single, composable environment in which users can use applications ranging from NFT marketplaces like OpenSea to lending protocols like Aave on mainnet. zkEVM would create a similar end experience for users, with cheaper transaction fees and nearly immediate finality, removing the need for the two-week withdrawal periods associated with Optimistic rollups.  ZK rollups are more computationally extensive and put a burden on nodes looking to solve zero-knowledge validity proofs, but they are able to post network state to Ethereum for a fraction of the cost of even Optimistic Rollups. zkSync and Loopring currently offer transaction fees 1/200th of the price on mainnet, according to L2Fees.Info. At the time of writing, a trade on a decentralized exchange would cost users on Ethereum’s base layer just over $90, while Loopring and zkSync users would pay between $0.45-$0.68.  If zkEVM is capable of offering fees similar to other ZK rollups, Ethereum’s scaling issues may be mitigated earlier than expected. Ethereum native applications will be able to manageably port over Solidity-based contracts and offer a full range of products in a cheap fee environment backed by Ethereum’s security. While lower transaction fees are an essential piece of scaling blockchains, it only matters if the chain can play host to applications that drive user demand. zkEVM will theoretically be able to host the industry's favorite applications without sacrificing liquidity, decentralization or product offering.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LRC | ARB | ZK,Edward Oosterbaan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/24/ethereum-gets-an-upgraded-scaling-testnet-and-its-actually-years-ahead-of-schedule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/651761bd51ba38475a6b69aa2298ec47e6a7328f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

For most of last year, most months had finished in the positive with green candles dominating the market. However, while most of the months have been positive, there have been significant differences between the first half of the month and the second half. This push and pull pattern has continued into the new year, spelling some bad news for the end of February.

A detective at the Sioux Falls police department recounted the chain of events to a victim of the hack in a Feb. 15 voicemail reviewed by CoinDesk. Officers responded to reports of an alleged “robbery” in progress at IRA Financial Trust’s offices in the South Dakota city on the afternoon of Feb. 8, the detective said.  Police officers quickly determined the robbery call was bogus, the detective said. He described the incident as “swatting”: the practice of tricking police into responding to a nonexistent crisis.  There was a robbery, however – but it was happening in cyberspace, not the Midwest.  “What we were then informed of was that once the employees returned to their desks, after, like, while this ‘robbery’ was taking place or whatever, once they got back to their desks, they all found that customers’ accounts had been hacked into and that money was actively being taken at that time,” the officer said in the voicemail. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk.  Read more:Reflections on a Swatting: Inside One Bitcoin Engineer's Security Battle  He said in the voicemail that IRA Financial soon managed to stop the money drain. “But by that point roughly a number of minutes had passed and a lot of damage had been done. They reported hundreds of victims as a result of this.”  The officer said he was sharing this information with the victim because ""it doesn’t appear that [IRA Financial is] telling their customers very much.""  In a statement, IRA Financial Trust said it was “aware” of the law enforcement’s recounting of events.  “Coordinated efforts like these emphasize the growing sophistication of cybercrime that make cyber threats both difficult to prevent and challenging to recover from,” the company said. “We are currently dedicating our attention and efforts to our active investigation and the potential recovery of funds through civil and law enforcement resources. To preserve the integrity of our investigation, we cannot provide further comment or details at this time.”  A baffling break-in  The detail adds another layer of intrigue to the seemingly inexplicable hack of IRA Financial Trust, an institutional partner of the Gemini exchange servicing retirement-minded crypto investors. Gemini, a $7 billion company that touts its security chops, has denied responsibility, instead blaming IRA Financial for the loss of millions of dollars in crypto.  Victims who spoke with CoinDesk said the hack should have been impossible. They described imposing strict controls on their Gemini accounts, including withdrawal address whitelisting, two-factor authentication, email notifications and other steps that they thought would stymie hackers.  A source close to Gemini previously said the company makes those safeguards available to institutional customers in order to prevent such incidents. It is unclear how those protocols were compromised on Feb. 8.

42395936,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0CXG,1645741220,"BitMEX Founders Arthur Hayes, Ben Delo Plead Guilty to Violating US Law","BitMEX founders Arthur Hayes and Benjamin Delo pleaded guilty to violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) in federal court on Thursday, the U.S. Department of Justice said Thursday.  Hayes and Delo were accused of violating the BSA by operating BitMEX, a crypto spot and derivatives trading platform, to operate with poor anti-money laundering (AML) protocols.  The two each pleaded guilty to one count of violating the BSA on Thursday. They could face a maximum of five years in prison, though their actual sentences will be decided by a federal judge later.  The DOJ and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) both brought federal charges against BitMEX and its founders in 2020. The CFTC and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network settled their own charges with BitMEX last year, with the company paying a $100 million penalty to the two regulatory agencies.  The DOJ alleged in October 2020 that Hayes, Delo and fellow company owner Samuel Reed “attempted to evade” U.S. AML regulations by setting up shop offshore but allowing U.S. customers to transact on the platform. The CFTC’s charges added on to this, claiming BitMEX allowed U.S. customers to trade crypto derivatives products despite BitMEX not registering as a derivatives platform with the federal regulator.  It was not immediately clear whether Reed and Gregory Dwyer, BitMEX’s first employee who was also charged in 2020, also plan to plead guilty to the charges.  “As a result of its willful failure to implement AML and KYC programs, BitMEX was in effect a money laundering platform. For example, in May 2018, Hayes was notified of allegations that BitMEX was being used to launder the proceeds of a cryptocurrency hack,” the DOJ said in a press release published Thursday.  BitMEX also allowed customers from Iran, a sanctioned jurisdiction, to use the platform, the DOJ said.  Hayes stepped down as BitMEX’s CEO shortly after the charges were brought.  In a statement sent after the publication of this article, Hayes said he accepted responsibility for his actions ""and looks forward to the time when he can put this matter behind him.""  In a statement sent through a spokesperson, Delo said ""he regrets that BitMEX, the cryptocurrency derivatives platform he co-founded, lacked an adequate customer identification program. Ben voluntarily appeared in the US to address these charges.""  Taylor Bossung, a spokesperson for BitMEX, said, ""We are aware of developments in the DOJ case but will not be commenting on an ongoing legal matter to which no BitMEX entity is a party. It's business as usual, all funds are safe, and there is no impact to the functionality of the platform including deposits and withdrawals.""

42395950,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0Ck3,1645740170,Plenty of Money and No One to Pay: Crypto Teams at ETHDenver Face Hiring Crunch,"Across four chaotic days last week, a sweaty mass of coders and HODLers wandered through Denver’s Sports Castle for a glimpse of the Web 3 future that Ethereum developers are racing to build.  They came hungry for alpha, for merch, for parties, for meetups with old friends and new at ETHDenver’s first in-person conference since COVID-19 took control. Some in the crowd of 12,000+ might have even come searching for jobs.  It’s hard to say how many. But according to the projects CoinDesk interviewed for this article, it was clearly not enough.  “We’re hiring” could have been the catchphrase for this year’s ETHDenver, the largest gathering of Ethereum talent anywhere in the world. Turn a corner, spot a recruiter. Pick up a sticker, find a QR-coded jobs board.  Nearly two-dozen protocol founders, product managers, engineers and other stakeholders interviewed for this article told CoinDesk that demand for blockchain developers has far outstripped the supply of experienced, increasingly expensive hands.  Read more: BUIDLing Among the Chaos: What Devs Discussed at ETHDenver  Consider it Ethereum’s version of the post-pandemic hiring crunch. Empowered by the Great Resignation, workers everywhere are commanding higher wages from short-staffed employers trying to stay afloat.  Nobody’s investing eight-figure sums in the neighborhood sandwich shop, though. But that kind of cash is flowing into every corner of crypto. Projects hawking the future of finance can amass millions in their seed round alone.  “There’s just so much capital. Everybody’s hiring and everybody’s funding,” said John Shutt, a senior engineer at the gamified data oracle service UMA. The team has four engineering slots to fill.  That an industry bulging with venture cash would struggle to fill its most important seats might seem rather odd. After all, Ethereum has given rise to multibillion-dollar crypto movements like non-fungible tokens (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi).  Part of the problem is the space’s nascent status. It was only seven years ago that Solidity, the programming language powering Ethereum smart contracts, and thus its many decentralized apps, debuted.  Developer growth  Venture firm Electric Capital estimated in a recent report that there were 18,000 monthly active developers committing code to open-source crypto and Web 3 projects in December 2021. The rate of Web 3 developer growth in 2021 was record-breaking, the report found, but the raw numbers are still small.  For example: “Less than 1,000 full-time developers are responsible for over $100 billion in total value locked in smart contracts,” Electric wrote.  And though the growth is certainly good, new devs aren’t necessarily the experienced devs that protocols want building sensitive financial rails.  “It’s almost like you’re looking for a unicorn: someone who has Web 3 experience but no job,” said Mihai Cosma, DeFi strategist at ElementFi, a fixed-rate lending protocol looking for two engineers.  Read more: What’s the Healthiest Chart in Crypto? The Developer Count  One of the issues is that Web 3 veterans have plenty of money-making opportunities beyond traditional jobs, according to Blocknative CEO Matt Cutler, who is hiring seven engineers. He said many “talented folks” are sitting out of the hiring frenzy, choosing instead to lever their knowledge as day traders.  Pressure from the venture capitalists is also shrinking the talent pool. Many top-tier candidates spin up their own project before joining someone else’s. And why not?  “People that are good candidates to hire are also good people to invest in,” said Shutt of UMA.  Schutt said he’s also noticed a conversion trend: from founder to angel investor. “A lot of people take that path.”  Companies have deployed creative solutions to fill in the gaps of this talent brain drain. ConsenSys, the Ethereum-centric crypto conglomerate, uses its “Solidity bootcamp” to train enterprising devs in smart-contract development and also identify standouts for hire.  This has produced “a handful” of ConsenSys team members, said Mei Chan, the firm’s product marketing lead for developer tools.  “There’s always a learning curve. We created a fantastic suite to help take Web 2 developers from zero to hero,” said Austin Baggio, product manager at NEAR, which has its own training course.  Let’s talk numbers  There’s plenty of demand for such onboarding experiences. Multiple project founders told CoinDesk of a “mass migration” of Web 2 talent into Web 3, where base salaries sparkle like nothing else.  A handful of founders ballparked a junior-level Solidity developer’s salary around $150,000. Mid-levels can make as much as double, and “gigabrains” can rake in $400,000 or more. One founder who asked not to be named said he’d heard of someone earning $700,000 as a developer.  But the real opportunity comes in the token allocations, multiple projects told CoinDesk. It’s like stock options on hyperdrive: a liquid, loosely restricted, highly lucrative hiring incentive that gives developers a say in the project’s direction.  So important are token allocations to this new economy that one founder who asked not to be named offered the following advice: If you’re not sure about the token package then don’t take the job.  Read more: At ETHDenver, Weird DeFi Comes Out of Its Shell  Some developers look toward the flow of eager Web 2 talent with a wary eye. Sure, it’s easy enough for experienced coders to pick up Solidity. But mastering the thought processes crucial to developing on distributed systems is another animal entirely.  “There are not enough developers that understand the weight of coding in Solidity,” said Isaac Patka, a serial DAO contributor who has worked in crypto through multiple market cycles.  Nevertheless, the unrelenting march of venture capital into an industry brimming with ideas means hiring managers have no choice but to make concessions.  “I might just go downstairs and hold up a sign that says, ‘I need a developer,’” said Jake McCarthy, a contributor to the financial news outlet Raging Bull. He’d been fruitlessly trying to fill a developer role for three months.

42395959,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0Cg7,1645738537,"Coinbase Beats Q4 Estimates, but Shares Fall on Outlook","Coinbase (COIN) shares fell in postmarket trading Thursday as the company reported strong fourth-quarter results but said it expects some headwinds in the first quarter.  Coinbase reported fourth-quarter revenue of $2.5 billion versus analyst estimates of $2.0 billion, while adjusted earnings per share came in at $3.32 , versus estimates of $1.94, according to FactSet. The company posted $2.3 billion in transaction revenue in the fourth quarter versus $1.1 billion in the third quarter.  Q4 trading volume of $547 billion was up from $327 billion in the third quarter. Coinbase also reported 11.4 million in monthly transacting users (MTU) in Q4 versus 7.4 million MTUs in Q3.  However, the crypto exchange said it has seen a drop in crypto asset volatility and prices versus all-time high levels in the fourth quarter, owing in part to macroeconomic factors and geographical instability in parts of the world. As a result, it expects retail MTUs along with total trading volume to be lower in the first quarter versus Q4.  Michael Safai, managing partner at crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital, said he wasn’t surprised by Coinbase’s strong Q4 results, given how the company has diversified beyond just bitcoin and ether. Safai noted that altcoins now make up close to 70% of Coinbase’s trading volume, versus around 40% in early 2021.  “All signs are pointing towards a continuation of this strategy, with its upcoming [non-fungible token] marketplace and its stated ambition to list every legal coin,” Safai said.  For 2022, Coinbase said it expects annual average retail MTUs of between five million to 15 million. ""This wider than normal set of factors results in a wider range of potential outcomes for 2022. Simply put, we have less near-term visibility, and it is currently too early to provide a more precise range,"" Coinbase said in a statement.  The exchange also expects subscription and services segment revenues to be lower in Q1 versus Q4 2021.  The company is planning for “aggressive” investment in its business in 2022, though it says it will be ready for varying market conditions that may arise. “In the event of a material decline in our business, below the ranges we have planned for, we may slow down our investments and would expect to manage our adjusted EBITDA losses to approximately $500 million on a full-year basis.”  Coinbase said it expects to spend $4.25 billion to $5.25 billion on tech and development and general and administrative expenses in 2022. This includes the company's plans to hire 6,000 employees in 2022, largely on technology and development teams.  Shares of Coinbase were falling about 5% after-hours on Thursday. Shares are down about 30% this year, and nearly 50% since debuting on the Nasdaq in April of last year.  In the fourth quarter, Coinbase's institutional platform added or expanded relationships with Anheuser-Busch, Brex, Enfusion and Franklin Templeton.  Regarding listing more assets and trading pairs, Coinbase said that ""as part of our strategy to serve as the primary crypto account and give our customers the greatest amount of choice, we want to list all legal assets.""  On the company's earnings call, Coinbase's CFO Emilie Choi said the company doesn't view NFTs as a ""zero-sum game"" and sees opportunity for competitors to emerge. Additionally, CEO Brian Armstrong said the goal isn't to beat-out OpenSea, and the NFT market is ripe. Armstrong also said the NFT opportunities will be much larger than solely digital artwork.

42395951,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0Cj4,1645738001,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stabilizes Amid Geopolitical Uncertainty,"Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies experienced sharp price swings over the past 24 hours amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  On Thursday, U.S. President Biden imposed additional sanctions on Russia for the attack. Russian airstrikes triggered declines across speculative assets worldwide, including cryptocurrencies.  The market capitalization across all cryptos slid toward $1.5 trillion, losing almost 9%. Bitcoin fell as much as 7%, although the crypto pared earlier losses and had returned above $38,000 at press time. Most alternative cryptocurrencies underperformed bitcoin over the past 24 hours.  ""Option volumes point to the likelihood that many investors are maintaining long positions while hedging risk with derivatives,"" Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at FundStrat, wrote in a email on Thursday.  ""Consistent with last week, we think it is wise to maintain long positions with time horizons beyond six months and be prepared to buy on dips,"" Farrell wrote.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $38456, +1.84%    ●Ether (ETH): $2645, +0.75%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4289, +1.50%    ●Gold: $1898 per troy ounce, −0.61%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.97%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Signs of capitulation  Bitcoin's trading volume across major spot exchanges reached its highest level in a month, according to CoinDesk data. Typically, high volume corrections could signal capitulation among sellers.  And from a technical perspective, there are initial signs on the charts of downside exhaustion, which typically precede short-term upswings in price.  Katie Stockton, managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, a technical research firm, also noticed a short-term counter trend signal for BTC. ""Hopefully this allows bitcoin to avoid a confirmed breakdown,"" Katie wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  A break below $37,361 would be bearish, although Stockton's work shows the current dip in BTC could exhaust itself today and give way to two weeks of stabilization.  Flight to safety  Risk-off has been the dominant theme so far this year, even before the events in Russia and Ukraine escalated into a full-scale war.  The chart below shows that long-term U.S. Treasurys have moved in lockstep with stocks, offering little protection for investors. Meanwhile, bitcoin have largely underperformed traditional assets year to date. And gold has maintained its status as a safe haven asset.  Still, returns across assets have narrowed, with bitcoin still in the lead over the past year.  Altcoin roundup  Tether's USDT stablecoin well over $1 on Ukrainian crypto exchange: Ukrainians were paying a steep premium over the U.S. dollar for Tether's USDT stablecoin after Russia invaded the Eastern European country. The price of USDT on the popular Ukrainian cryptocurrency exchange Kuna jumped Thursday by almost 5% in the past 24 hours to 32 Ukrainian hryvnia, the country’s national currency. The price works out to $1.10 per USDT, which is supposed to be worth $1, according to CoinDesk’s Helene Braun. Read more here.

The address in question has been active since at least August 2021, but the vast majority of the 1,847 recorded transactions took place in February, many of them in the last 72 hours. According to Elliptic's Tom Robinson, the charity received a single $3 million donation in bitcoin on Friday, as well as close to $400,000 in bitcoin on Thursday.  Donations have been pouring into Ukraine as it braced for an invasion by Russia. On Thursday, Russia launched a full blown military assault on the country. Russian forces recently reportedly captured the infamous Chernobyl power plant. The U.S., among other nations, has imposed heavy sanctions on Russia as the offensive continues.  Crypto markets took a big hit on the invasion news Thursday evening, liquidating around $242 million in mere hours. In Ukraine, people have started to seek out crypto as a safe haven, said Michael Chobanian, founder of the Ukrainian crypto exchange Kuna, during an interview on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program on Wednesday.  Social media posts that listed the bitcoin wallet address (Bc1qkd5az2ml7dk5j5h672yhxmhmxe9tuf97j39fm6) among other methods of donation have been shared widely since at least Tuesday. The project collecting the funds, called “Come Back Alive,” claims to be assisting Ukraine’s military efforts. The wallet in question has already disbursed $150,000 worth of bitcoin it has received so far.  On Friday, Ukraine's official Twitter account posted a link to the Come Back Alive donation page, which includes details for its bitcoin wallet.  “All funds received by the Charitable Foundation are used exclusively for the needs of the army,” the organization states on its website, pointing to a live spreadsheet used for reporting transactions.  The last transactions reported are from Feb. 25.  Separately, according to a post calling for donations to support Ukraine’s armed forces, the country’s ministry of defense cannot accept crypto donationshttps://ukraine.ua/news/support-the-armed-forces-of-ukraine/ under national legislation. Crypto users flocked to a Twitter post from the Ukraine asking for donations to its army, and urged the ministry to set up a crypto wallet; none has been set up so far.  Meanwhile, another bitcoin wallet, this one set up by the Ukrainian English-language news publication Kyiv Independent, has received around $5,500 in donations. The publication said the donations will help to continue reporting on the conflict.  UPDATE (Feb. 24, 22:51 UTC): Updated with information from Elliptic in second graph.

42394287,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbDJN,1645735231,"At ETHDenver, Weird DeFi Comes Out of Its Shell","In spite of it all, the vibes were indomitable.  Between the Thursday Schelling Point mini-conference and the Sunday ETHDenver closing ceremony, Ethereum ether (ETH) token’s price fell as much as 15%. Meanwhile, Russian military equipment and personnel continued massing on the Ukrainian border, setting the stage for what has, as of today, become the largest land conflict in Europe since World War II ended in 1945. Just after the ETHDenver event formally ended, a $1.7 million non-fungible token (NFT) hack briefly appeared to be a wider OpenSea vulnerability that could have wiped out the fortunes of dozens, if not hundreds, of those gathered.  And yet, perhaps the most common conversation I had with attendees was jovial and conspiratorial: “Do you think Banteg is here?”  The pseudonymous purple bunny avatar was the most popular ETHDenver attendee who wasn’t actually in attendance. Like many, I was shocked when I saw that Yearn Finance, Banteg’s project, was hosting a booth at the conference. The OG “yield vault” is one of decentralized finance’s (DeFi) largest and most notorious platforms, and has a sprawling history as rich in innovation as it is in controversy. It was born in the COVID-19 years, is entirely online-native and a booth – a classic corporate fixture – felt at odds with Yearn’s rebellious ethos.  Read more: 'Let's Not Be Bitcoin': Yearn Finance Considers Minting $200M in New YFI Tokens  On Twitter, Banteg is an outspoken cypherpunk waging a one-rabbit campaign to keep DeFi weird and out of the hands of “the suits.” They’re known as much for sharing their (vast) hentai collection as they are for waxing poetic about the revolutionary potential of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). In many ways they serve as a figurehead for Yearn, embodying all of its ambition and weirdness.  Bringing any kind of internet-based culture into the real world is both awkward and inescapably uncool.  In Denver, I saw at least a dozen different name tags proclaiming its bearer as “Banteg,” as everyone took a turn at playing Ethereum’s own pathological, porn-posting Spartacus in place of the real thing.  I thought it was a fun bit, and one which benefited from some extra oomph courtesy of a semi-staged heist, and eventual recovery, of two hand-painted dakimakura pillows – a sting operation ostensibly organized by Banteg themself.  Reactions to the stunt on social media were decidedly mixed, however.  Yearn’s presence at the conference struggled with the painful reality that bringing any kind of internet-based culture into the real world is both awkward and inescapably uncool. While this is most acute among chuds wearing Bored Ape hoodies and the like, the rule nonetheless also applies to DeFi degens.  Growing pains  In DeFi’s case, facing an awkward entrance into the physical world is also starting to look like an inevitability. Indeed, the fabled DeFi Summer – when the notion of DeFi surged for the first time from an oddity to a true financial vertical – was back in 2020, the first summer of COVID-19 lockdown.  Until now, DeFi has thrived in a cloistered, largely online-only culture and environment. Similar to Yearn’s rise, from DeFi Summer to now, the ecosystem leapt from roughly $500 million to a staggering $200 billion in total value locked. In terms of deposits, that’s now the equivalent of a mid-sized American bank; in terms of the pace of growth, there’s not a lot of comparisons to be made without sounding hyperbolic. The steam engine? The invention of the internet? It’s closer than not.  Read more: BUIDLing Among the Chaos: What Devs Discussed at ETHDenver  The next foot to fall will be when DeFi begins integrating with legacy financial infrastructure. In addition to hosting a fish-on-a-bicycle booth at a conference, Yearn is cooking integrations with the likes of crypto blue-chips Coinbase (COIN) and Ledger, among dozens of other popular onboarding platforms, according to pseudonymous spokesperson Weaver.  And Yearn is not alone, either: MakerDAO is working with French banking giant SocGen on a bond trial; Aave and Compound are in a footrace to attract users to smart contract–based institutional lending; Centrifuge has hurdled $100 million in real-world collateral into DeFi. Short of a unified, concerted effort from an unprecedented alliance of global regulators to ban the tech entirely, I don’t see how it stops.  In cultural terms, what that means is the people who used to only tweet psychotic stuff on the internet are suddenly going to be shouting psychotic stuff in real life. We’ve gotten a glimpse of that the past few weeks: If Messari’s Ryan Selkis on Tucker Carlson and the Yearn guys playacting hentai stings at a 12,000-person conference are any indication, it’s gonna get real weird!  In more practical terms, though, what real-world integration means is that DeFi yields will soon be easily available to even the most unsophisticated of crypto investors, including those who have never ventured from a centralized exchange. Shortly after that, too, I’m aware of at least two companies set to offer publicly traded vehicles bringing those yields to crypto-curious savers who can’t even be bothered to wander off their boomer brokerage websites.  No one should be shocked when – in just a few months to years – this infrastructure is freely and easily available as part of savings, spending or retirement products. Nonetheless, outside observers largely will be shocked.  Out of the ether: 2020 vs. now  I spend the vast majority of my social, professional and intellectual life online. It warps my sense of reality in a variety of ways (months feel like years in DeFi, and money is increasingly an abstraction), but conferences like ETHDenver snap into focus time and scale. The word that often came to mind over the weekend was “parallax.”  Just a few years ago, at ETHDenver 2020, existential angst was perhaps the norm. The ecosystem was emerging from a devastating bear market and not everyone thought the rally was real. I was working for a crypto infrastructure provider and didn’t know if I’d have a job in a month, let alone a year.  “All of Web 3 is a startup,” one grizzled tech vet told me at the hotel bar back then, his eyes bloodshot from one too many Vodka Red Bulls. “This could all go to zero.”  Not so much today! In 2022, a popular posture among the old guard was to actively call for a bear market – just a lil grizzly to wipe out the NFT kids and the sudden proliferation of VCs (everyone is a VC these days). In just two years, the dominant question has shifted from “Will we survive?” to “How long until the next big thing?”  In Denver, I saw a former DeFi developer who is now a congressional candidate (and likely frontrunner), Matt West, shake down Selkis, the Messari founder, for money. Billionaire former presidential candidate Andrew Yang showed up to pitch a lobbying DAO, had a hard time getting in and then gamely stuck around for hours after to meet attendees. Fellow billionaire Kimbal Musk also came through to discuss a DAO of his own, and had a photo op with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.  Read more: DeFi on the Ballot: Yearn Developer Matt West Is Running for Congress  Just a short time ago, Ethereum was a technology and culture that felt perilously close to obliteration. Now, the rich and the powerful are choosing to hitch their wagons to it. That alone feels remarkable, but it’s even more stunning when you have the historical perspective.

Not included in the new sanctions against the Kremlin was Russia’s elimination from the Swift global settlement and communications system for banks, with Biden saying European allies were not on board with such a move. Also not included were personal sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Bitcoin (BTC) had tumbled to about $34,400 in the overnight hours following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but has been gaining ground throughout the day. Those gains have sped up since the Biden press conference, with the price now just shy of $39,000.  “Bitcoin is paring losses as some investors think the majority of the brunt of the selling is over,” said Edward Moya, financial analyst at Oanda. “The Russia-Ukraine crisis will remain a volatile situation, but most of that risk aversion has been priced in for bitcoin.”  Stocks are in rally mode as well, with the Nasdaq – down nearly 3% at its worst levels – currently up 2.4%. The S&P 500 is now ahead 0.6%. Paring earlier gains in a big way is gold, which is off about $100 from the morning hours, and now down 1.15% for the session at $1,888 per ounce. Oil has had a major reversal as well, now at $92 per barrel after having topped $100 earlier.  A topic of interest throughout the day has been whether Russia might consider bitcoin as a way to evade Western sanctions. Quantum Economics analyst Jason Deane said it’s an intriguing thought, and that while bitcoin might be a topic of intense interest of late it remains “too young” of a technology for this sort of purpose.

42395932,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0CSL,1645731449,"President Biden Announces Technology Export Controls, Bank Sanctions Against Russia","President Joe Biden announced the U.S. will freeze Russian financial assets, seize assets from high-ranking officials and block technology exports in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Announcing the sanctions in a public address Thursday, Biden joined numerous countries worldwide in penalizing Russia hours after the country began firing cruise missiles and sending troops into Ukraine.  The sanctions announced Thursday include technology export controls to limit Russia's ability to work on its aerospace, ship-building and other industries; freezing assets belonging to Russia's largest banks and freezing assets belonging to ""Russian elites"" and their family members. Biden said Thursday's sanctions could cut off more than half of Russia's ""high-tech"" imports.  The U.S. will freeze assets at Russia's largest banks kept in the U.S., including VTB Bank, a state-owned entity and Russia's second-largest bank, as well as Sberbank. Similarly, the U.K. announced earlier on Thursday it would freeze any British-based assets belonging to VTB. The European Union is similarly freezing Russian assets and blocking bank access to European financial markets.  A U.S. Treasury Department press release said Thursday's actions would ""fundamentally alter"" these banks' ability to conduct operations.  ""On a daily basis, Russian financial institutions conduct about $46 billion worth of foreign exchange transactions globally, 80% of which are in U.S. dollars. The vast majority of those transactions will now be disrupted,"" the release said.  State-owned entities will also be blocked from debt markets in the U.S.  Biden added the U.S., EU and other nations will coordinate to try to limit Russia's ability to transact with euros, dollars, pounds or yen. Biden met with leaders of the G7 earlier in the day.  The U.S. is also sanctioning Belarusian defense and financial entities due to their role in supporting Russia's invasion, according to a separate Treasury Dept. press release.  The U.S. will not attempt to expel Russia from the SWIFT global messaging network at this time. The Belgium-based organization underpins financial transactions between banks in different countries, processing close to $77 trillion in payments in 2019.  In response to a reporter's question, Biden said the sanctions announced Thursday might have more of an impact than kicking Russia out of SWIFT.  ""The sanctions that we proposed on all their banks have equal consequence, maybe more consequence than SWIFT,"" he said. ""It's always an option but it's not the position the rest of Europe wants to take.""  Biden appeared to be referring to Germany and Italy, two key holdouts reportedly not yet in favor of taking this step. The EU would have to sign off on any expulsion. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced support for removing Russia from the network.  The U.S. president slammed Russian President Vladimir Putin in his remarks.

42395946,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0Ce9,1645731308,Bitcoin Latest Price Drop Suggests It’s Not ‘Digital Gold’ for Everyone,"Bitcoin’s choppy week amid Russia’s Ukraine invasion shows the cryptocurrency might not be the safe haven backers believe it to be.  Some digital-asset investors have previously described bitcoin as “digital gold” – referring to the idea that the cryptocurrency could serve as a ""store of value"" similar to that of the precious metal and would hold its value in times of geopolitical or economic turmoil.  Instead, the price of bitcoin (BTC) is down 11% on the week.  Since Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “special military operation” in Ukraine, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has struggled to break above the $37,000 mark in the last 24 hours after dipping below $34,400 briefly earlier Thursday. U.S. President Joe Biden imposed fresh sanctions against Russia.  Gold, in contrast to bitcoin, is trading at its highest levels in over a year. The precious metal, often touted as a safe-haven asset at times of crisis and war, is up 1.4% on the week and reached a spot price high of $1,974 today.  “Bitcoin has shown itself better at protecting against inflation expectations and less suited to protect against geopolitical risk – something that gold has proven, again, to be better suited for during this crisis,” said Gavin Smith, CEO of the digital-assert firm Panxora.io, in an email to CoinDesk.  Conor Keohane, a trader at Eqonex, a Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange company, said in an email that ""with geopolitical forces top of everyone's mind, today we see a risk-off sentiment and a flight to gold, Swiss francs and yen.""  ""The safe-haven assets are bid, while in high-risk assets like crypto we will see continued downward pressure as risk-off continues,"" Keohane said.  Inflationary pressures  Panxora's Smith says that in the coming weeks this dynamic might turn around.  “As the West starts to announce sanctions, we anticipate the energy products to remain very strong,” he said. “This should start to cause a decoupling between bitcoin and equity markets and should result in bitcoin rising significantly over the next two to three months.”  “The catalyst for this will be the acceptance that inflationary pressures are likely to continue rising in the medium term, causing continued cost-of-living increases and continued strains on Western government finances,” said Smith.  Oil prices exceeded $100 a barrel for the first time since July 2014.  “Equally, given Russia’s importance to the energy sector, it is no surprise to see gas and oil trading at hugely elevated levels,” said Rupert Rowling, an analyst at Kinesis Money.

42394279,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbCjT,1645730563,Why the CryptoPunk Flop Is a Turning Point for NFT Auctions,"The stage was set in New York City last night. The Champagne had been poured, the lights were up, collectors sat ready and waiting.  At the Sotheby’s Upper East Side saleroom, NFT enthusiasts prepared to witness what the auction house had framed as a “truly historic” occasion – the sale of 104 CryptoPunks in a single lot.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The sale – dubbed “Punk It!” – was meant to be a kind of coronation for the pseudonymous investor “0x650d” (a nod to the leading characters of their Ethereum address), who purchased the tokens last year in a single transaction.  Except the sale didn’t happen. Minutes before an auctioneer was expected to take the stage, an announcement rang out over the loudspeaker:  “Following discussions with the consignor, tonight's ‘Punk It!’ sale has been withdrawn. Thank you to our panelists, guests and viewers for joining us.”  The message was reproduced by a Twitter account for the auction house’s NFT division. At publication time, the sale’s official webpage displayed a 404 errorhttps://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2022/punk-it.  So, what happened?  The non-fungible tokens in the “Punk It!” lot were what’s known as “floor punks” – the cheapest CryptoPunks listed for sale at a given time. 0x650d paid about $5.5 million for the whole batch.  “Why buy 100 floor punks instead of a single rare one?” the collector wrote on Twitter last August, just after the purchase. “The short answer is liquidity and diversification. If you get to own a Picasso, do you care which one?”  At the time, CryptoPunks were far and away the priciest NFT collection. They fell into second place behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club late last year, and the floor price has been steadily trending downward.  Sotheby’s was intending to make a splash with this sale. Two nights ago, the auction house hosted a private dinner to generate buzz for the event. It also brought in ​​Kenny Schachter, a columnist at Artnet News, Colborn Bell, a co-founder of the Museum of Crypto Art, and Sherone Rabinovitz, a technologist, to host a panel on the culture of NFTs just before the planned sale.  See also: JPEGs On Sale, Baby | The Node  On Twitter, 0x650d proudly tried to frame the last-minute withdrawal as a “rug pull” – crypto speak for a type of scam where developers abandon their gullible investors, making off with the profits. (0x650d didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.)  “Nvm, decided to hodl,” he tweeted.  The collector even made a bespoke meme in the tried-and-true Drake format, suggesting that “rugging Sotheby’s” was an intentional stab at “taking punks mainstream.”  While 0x650d seems to be digging in his heels, reporters are painting a different picture. My colleague Eli Tan, who was on the scene last night, reported that “the highest bid on the table, behind closed doors and before the sale,” was just $14 million – far short of the $20 million to $30 million estimate previously provided by the auction house. The lot’s reserve price was $14 million.  Scott Lewis, co-founder of the crypto analytics platform DeFi Pulse, quipped:  me after my s**tcoin bag is down 95%:  Last night felt like a turning point for the once-ascendant CryptoPunks, and an unprecedented fizzling-out for what’s been a massive cash cow for traditional auction houses over the past year.  Larva Labs, the two-man development team behind CryptoPunks, generated controversy earlier this month for selling recently unearthed tokens tied to the CryptoPunks smart contract, called “V1 Punks,” and then promptly disavowing the project. Investors have also repeatedly expressed displeasure with Larva Labs’ lack of community outreach, while Bored Apes get parties with Lil Baby and the Strokes. (It’s worth noting that the average sale price for NFTs in the Bored Ape Yacht Club is down, too.)  Sotheby’s and Christie’s spent 2021 milking the NFT craze with a series of high-profile auctions, and my sense is that the trend can’t continue forever. CryptoPunks will always have historical value, and NFTs won’t disappear from auction blocks anytime soon, but the fracas surrounding 0x650d’s withdrawal was a bad omen for the “headline-grabbing NFT auction” paradigm.  It’s a major blemish on the traditional art world’s track record with crypto assets, after a year of near-constant success.  Maybe, down the line, NFTs like CryptoPunks will find their way into more group sales, with collectors treating them more like traditional artworks. This was how major auction houses approached NFTs in the first place – it was only once the market began to explode that NFT sales were cordoned off from other pieces of modern art.  For token holders, though, the party goes on. After last night’s non-sale: Sotheby’s still went ahead with its post hoc celebration.

42410905,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtG4W,1645726827,"No, Crypto Won't 'Fix This' for Russia","UPDATE (Feb. 24, 2022 21:00 UTC): Shortly after this article was published Biden indeed announced expanded sanctions.  The U.S. is moving to cut Russian oligarchs and officials off from their offshore funds and their ability to transact within the global financial system after Russian forces invaded Ukraine late Wednesday.  Unlike previous sanctions, the new measures may go as far as expelling Russia from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the international messaging service used by banks to send money around the world. While cryptocurrency conceivably may offer an alternative way for individuals or organizations to transact, the Russian government’s lukewarm stance on the technology and other factors may limit its use for this purpose.  U.S. President Joe Biden will announce new sanctions against Russia on Thursday, he said in public statements, in hopes that financial penalties will convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to withdraw from Ukraine and cease war efforts.  In doing so, the U.S. and European Union are effectively trying to cut these officials and oligarchs off from being able to transact with parties anywhere in the world. The move came hours after Russian military forces launched attacks on various cities and military bases in Ukraine, including in the nation’s capital of Kiev.  Russia first announced it would send “peacekeepers” into Donetsk and Luhansk, two regions in eastern Ukraine that Putin recognized as independent entities on Monday. The U.S., Canada, Japan, EU and a number of other nations announced an initial slate of sanctions after this initial incursion, targeting specific people or entities.  However, Wednesday’s attack dwarfed Monday’s incursion in scale, prompting Biden to announce further sanctions would be coming.  The initial sanctions package was “designed to impose overwhelming and immediate costs to the largest financial institutions and state-owned enterprises in Russia,” Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics Daleep Singh told reporters.  This initial package could be modified as needed, Singh said.  “We’re also prepared to impose powerful export controls as part of our response package,” he said at a White House press briefing. “Both financial sanctions and export controls deny something to Russia that it needs and can’t get from anywhere other than the United States or our Allies and partners. Financial sanctions deny foreign capital to Russia, and export controls deny critical technological inputs that Russia needs to diversify its economy and to deliver on Putin’s strategic ambitions in aerospace, defense and high-tech.”  Andrew Jacobson, an associate with law firm Seward & Kissel, told CoinDesk that he expects further sanctions to target Russia’s largest banks: VTB Bank, SberBank and Gazprombank. Other sanctions could target Russia’s energy sector and oligarchs, particularly those who have assets overseas such as yachts.  The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which oversees U.S. sanctions, has the ability to put vessels and entities as well as people on its list, he said.  Sanctions targeting oligarchs could include actions against their adult children and all assets located outside Russia. These oligarchs constitute a key source of Putin’s power base.  “I think the biggest thing is really how U.S. companies are going to implement the sanctions into their compliance programs,” Jacobson said. “I think there's going to be some really tremendous challenges over the coming months, deciphering the new rules that come out, understanding really complex ownership structures and how the restrictions apply to those ownership structures.”  SWIFT access  The U.S. has not yet gone so far as to try and cut Russia off from SWIFT, the messaging network underpinning global financial transactions.  Expelling Russia from SWIFT would mean the country would have difficulty transacting with any non-Russian financial institution.  There is precedent: SWIFT cut a number of Iranian banks off from its services in 2012, blocking the country from participating in financial transactions with the rest of the world. At the time, local business operators said the move would “make life even more difficult for us,” Reuters reported.  White House officials said expelling Russia from SWIFT was still “on the table” after announcing the earlier sanctions. Singh said that it would not be in the initial package.  “We have other severe measures we can take that our allies and partners are ready to take in lockstep with us, and that don’t have the same spillover effects,” he said. “But we always will monitor these options, and we’ll revise our judgments as time goes on.”  U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for SWIFT to eject Russia during a speech before the G-7 on Thursday.  Jacobson sees a cutoff from SWIFT as unlikely at this time.  “I don't know that cutting them off from SWIFT is really going to do much more. SWIFT is just a messaging system. It'd be an inconvenience in the short term, but ultimately in the long term, countries that have been cut off of SWIFT have still found ways to operate within the global financial system and operate domestically as well,” he said.  Crypto’s role  While headlines suggest crypto might be used to bypass Russian sanctions, Jacobson does not see this as a likely workaround.  Autocratic regimes would find it difficult to adopt decentralized assets, he said, and Russia, in particular, is no fan of bitcoin, although Putin once met Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin. The country’s central bank tried to ban cryptocurrencies just weeks ago.  “I think Russia probably is thinking about using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions, but on the other hand, is probably concerned about those cryptocurrencies getting too much popularity within their own country, because that impacts their own control of their own monetary system, and therefore impacts their power,” he said.  Caroline Malcolm, Chainalysis’ head of international policy, told CoinDesk that the blockchain analytics firm had not yet seen any unusual activity from Russian crypto exchanges over the last few days.  Even if some individuals do choose to turn to crypto, it’s unclear whether they would be able to effectively bypass sanctions using decentralized assets. Companies might monitor sanctioned wallets for any transactions or refuse to transact with these addresses entirely.  “We've seen that in the past with sanctions, you've got examples where wallet addresses have been named as sanctioned entities, and that allows Chainalysis to put in place alerts for our customers, whether they be government or from industry,” Malcolm said. “So that if they have transactions, which you know, intersecting with sanctioned entities, they'll be able to see those and get an alert on those immediately.”  Governments increasingly have the tools they need to “rein in crypto,” Solidus Labs’ Chen Arad said.  It is a sign of crypto’s maturation that it is being discussed as a tool to bypass sanctions, but the industry has also evolved to the point where financial regulators can monitor this sector, he said.  “Regulators have developed the ability, I think, to recognize already that there are ways to rein it in, and the industry has recognized that it will be reined in one way or another,” he said.

Investors in the round included crypto market maker and Aligned ecosystem partner GSR, Altium Capital, Calvary Fund and a number of private investors, including film producer and sports agent Happy Walters.  The round was primarily used to expand Aligned's high-performance computing footprint.  “We are buying silicon, manufacturing and installing the custom hardware that we produce with that silicon, as well as expanding our HPC (high-performance computing) team,” Cassatt told CoinDesk in an email. “Most of this hardware will go into our primary data center and will be expanding to more soon.”  The product line of Puerto Rico-based Aligned includes technology for mining, staking and liquidity provisioning for Ethereum-compatible blockchains, including layer 2 networks, as well as prominent blockchains and emerging architectures.  The growth of proof-of-stake blockchains has increased the demand for staking and validators. Aligned enables on-chain liquidity provisioning and said it has, to date, supported the deployment of 15,000 ETH (about $440.5 million) across the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.  The company says it’s working with clients like Neptune DAO that provide liquidity to upstart DeFi projects to deploy liquidity to their platforms.  “You need three basic things to make a DeFi application work, and we provide all of them: 1. liquidity/money in the protocol, 2. software that sends the transactions and runs the blockchain, and 3. computers to run it on, in our case specialized hardware that is designed for this use,” Cassatt said. “Taken together, this is a ‘full-stack’ infrastructure since it works and operates at these layers in a vertically integrated way.”  Crypto infrastructure firms have become venture capital darlings in recent weeks with Blockdaemon raising $207 million at a $3.25 billion valuation and Alchemy bringing in $200 million at a $10 billion valuation.

Vertically integrated, said Lewis, means Core owns not just mining rigs but the infrastructure to host such rigs for both itself and others.

With another 7.5 EH scheduled to come online later this year, the company’s global market share could rise to 4%-5%. Core also has a diversified infrastructure footprint, with seven locations across the U.S., and another two under construction.  Another selling point is the company’s hosting business for third-party miners (currently at about 7.1 EH), a source of stable revenue that should enable a lower cost of capital than peers, said Lewis.

The price of USDT on the popular Ukrainian cryptocurrency exchange Kuna jumped Thursday by almost 5% in the past 24 hours to 32 Ukrainian hryvnia, the country’s national currency. The price works out to $1.10 per USDT, which is supposed to be worth $1.  As tensions between Russia and Ukraine tighten, some citizens are looking for a safe haven to keep their assets. With most traditional cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin or ether, very volatile, Ukrainians are choosing to put their money into stablecoins, specifically tether.  Across crypto markets more broadly, USDT was still holding fast to its $1 peg. As of press time, USDT was changing hands at 99.9727 cents, based on CoinDesk pricing that blends data feeds from many of the world's largest exchanges.  But there is a limited supply in Ukraine of USDT, the biggest stablecoin by market capitalization at about $80 billion. And that's becoming a problem, Kuna founder Michael Chobanian told CoinDesk TV in an interview on Wednesday.  “The majority of people have nothing else to choose apart from crypto,” he said. “We're talking about millions of dollars of cash that wants to go into crypto … but we can't find people who are willing to do the opposite, sell it.”  Kuna says it has around 40,000 active accounts, 90% of them belonging to Ukrainian residents.

While the People's Bank of China and a host of other top-level agencies had declared that crypto transactions are illegal fundraising back in September 2021, the court ruling formally designates them as a crime and determines related punishments.  Thursday's ruling said that suspects will be prosecuted under Article 176 of China's criminal law, which stipulates prison sentences between three and 10 years and fines between RMB 50,000 (US$7,900) and RMB 500,000 ($79,000) for crimes involving large sums of money. Less serious crimes will be prosecuted with under three years of prison and RMB 20,000 ($3,160) to RMB 200,000 ($31,600) in fines, according to the criminal law.  The amendment comes into effect on March 1.  The law targets illegal fundraising through crypto transactions when four conditions are met, explained Shi Lei, China-based attorney, arbitrator and lecturer. These are public fundraising, unclear fundraising goals, promised returns on capital and interest and activities that violate laws and regulations, he said.  ""It's a speculation crackdown,"" Kendra Schaefer, who heads the tech practice at Beijing-based consultancy Trivium, told CoinDesk. Some crypto companies promise high returns to investors, but these encourage highly speculative investments, which Chinese regulators are trying to eliminate.

No valuation was provided, with the round bringing the company’s total funding up to $45 million.  Other investors in the round included Qiming Venture Partners, DHVC, A&T and Value Internet Fund.  Founded in 2018 with offices in Beijing, the United States and Canada, InfStones plans to use the funding to expand operations in Asia, Europe and South America. The company will also triple its team from 30 to 90 employees over the next year, and expand support to more than 100 blockchains and protocols, up from more than 50 currently.  InfStones has been profitable since 2018, CEO Zhenwu Shi told CoinDesk in an interview. The purpose of the fundraising is to build out the ecosystem and network of collaborators. Current InfStones customers include crypto exchange Binance and analytics firm Dune Analytics.  The InfStones platform provides easy access to protocol consensus and proof-of-stake staking benefits. Users can run validator nodes, access on-chain data and build decentralized applications across multiple chains. The platform-as-a-service supports tens of thousands of nodes on blockchains including BNB Chain, Cardano, Chainlink, Ethereum, Polkadot, Polygon and Solana.  “A lot of blockchains want to become more decentralized, which requires more people to launch a node in their ecosystem. But those people don’t have a technology background and don’t know how to maintain those nodes,” said Shi. “Using our product, they can very easily launch and participate in the blockchain network.”  Read more: Blockchain Startup InfStones Raises $10M in Series A Funding Round  InfStones has also launched a new front-end user interface that lets clients easily deploy nodes within minutes. The public application programming interface (API) can deploy nodes for BNB Chain, BSC Archival Data, Ethereum, and NEO with support for Cosmos and other chains coming soon.  “Just as AWS has made it easy for companies to deploy applications across servers, storage, and databases, InfStones is making it simple to deploy nodes, APIs, and other services,” said Dragonfly Capital Partner Tom Schmidt in a press release. “Their platform helps reduce the barriers to entry for new companies that are looking to incorporate blockchain technology into their stack.”  Other firms vying for the same crown are also raising lofty sums.

42415779,ZC3JxkpHqXjrHiKmfGZ3mQ,1645716880,The Case for Taxing Proof-of-Work,"Bitcoin is an energy-intensive protocol designed for serious cypherpunks. Alas, bitcoin has been mobbed by unserious speculators, pushing up its price and blowing up its electricity usage. It’s time to enact a tax on proof-of-work. The tax would drive the tourists away, bring proof-of-work consumption back to a balanced level and make bitcoin cheap again for cypherpunks.  The Bitcoin network provides bitcoin owners with a unique sort of security – proof-of-work. Proof-of-work, or PoW, is a method for securing a network in a decentralized manner. The process, however, is incredibly energy-intensive, requiring thousands of competing processors, or miners, to perform redundant calculations. Other forms of security, say that underlying instruments listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, rely on cheaper centralized methods.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week.  Think of bitcoin as an M1 Abrams tank. A Nasdaq-listed stock is a zippy little Toyota. Most of the time a cheap Toyota works fine. But there are times and places when an expensive M1 Abrams is needed.  There is a small community of cypherpunks – hobbyists and technologically informed individuals – who like to consume bitcoin's tank-like security. They make PoW-secured transactions and eschew non-PoW-secured transactions. These cypherpunks are well-versed in self-custody. They have a deep understanding of what bitcoin is and can clearly articulate why they prefer PoW-based security.  Then there is the great unwashed.  Read more: Avoid Crypto Tax Headaches: What You Need to Know if You Bought or Sold Crypto in 2021  Most of the people buying bitcoin these days are not cypherpunks. They are casual users. These “tourists” don't particularly want to make peer-to-peer bitcoin payments. They don't care about the Bitcoin network's tank-like level of security. They are quite content to keep their bitcoins lodged at Coinbase or Binance. They couldn't write a lucid paragraph on PoW if their lives depended on it.  What these casual users are after is ""number goes up"" – they want to get rich. And it's because of this influx of speculators that a tax on proof-of-work could end up being necessary.  We can all agree that it'd be overkill to routinely drive an M1 Abrams tank to shop at the local corner store. The odds of getting held up just for one's butter and eggs just doesn't justify the costly security of an M1 Abrams. A Toyota will do just fine, thank you. The same goes for proof-of-work. For most people, consuming expensive proof-of-work security is akin to using an M1 Abrams to go shopping. It's unnecessary, even frivolous. A cheap Nasdaq penny stock should suffice.  The sheer physical cost of filling up an M1 Abrams with gas is a major impediment to casual tank usage. Alas, this ""brake"" doesn't operate with proof-of-work. Casual bitcoin users get to enjoy bitcoin’s tank-like security without incurring any out-of-pocket costs.  The reason that casual bitcoiners don't feel the immense expense of bitcoin security is because the mining bill is (mostly) paid for with new bitcoin. Every 10 minutes, 6.25 new bitcoins are created to compensate miners. Issuance of new bitcoins doesn't hurt the price of the bitcoin in tourists’ wallets. The timetable of new bitcoins was built into the price of bitcoin ages ago.  And so the casual bitcoin tourist gets bitcoin's gold-plated security without having to endure any associated costs. It's as if they get to drive an M1 Abrams tank to Walmart, for free. If you could drive an M1 Abrams to Walmart for free, wouldn’t you?  Proof-of-work should never have been more than a neat niche product used by cypherpunks and other associated outsiders. Thanks to an influx of casual buyers, the Bitcoin network now uses a massive 141 terawatt hours per year of electricity, about 0.63% of the world's electricity, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. That’s more electricity than many countries and industries.  Bitcoin’s energy consumption could grow to much larger proportions. Say that casual buyers push the price of bitcoin up to $380,000 in 2023. That's 10 times the current price, a move that bitcoin has done many times before. With bitcoin at $380,000, the total market value of all bitcoin ever mined would be $7.8 trillion, just a little less than the value of all gold ever mined  As the price of bitcoin rises, the real value of the 6.25 BTC mining reward increases, attracting more miners that burn ever more electricity. With bitcoin's price at $380,000, the Bitcoin network would be consuming a whopping 1,400 terawatt hours or so of electricity, around 6% of the world's electricity (I'm using a simple linear interpolation from today's price and energy consumption.)  That would be a tragic mistake. We shouldn’t be sacrificing 6% of the world's energy to produce tank-like levels of security for speculators who don’t need that security. There are far better uses for scarce energy resources than pure price speculation.  That's where the tax comes in.  Read more: US Crypto Tax Year 2022: Inflation-Based Changes to Know  Sometime before bitcoin hits $380,000, a tax on bitcoin purchases should be implemented. It would apply at regulated venues like Coinbase and Kraken and on large professional actors, like hedge funds. Casual speculators would finally feel some of the burden of producing bitcoin's security. To avoid the tax, they would likely select other types of volatile instruments, ones with a much lower electricity requirements. They might, for instance, purchase proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, Nasdaq penny stocks, three times-levered exchange-traded funds or out-of-the-money Tesla options.  The tax would make most people better off than before (or at least just as well-off).  Casual tourists would remove bitcoin from their menu of bets. But there are hundreds of thousands of speculative instruments offering wild price gyrations, and so the tourists are effectively no less well-off than before. They would get Nasdaq levels of security rather than Bitcoin-levels of security, but for casual bettors that's fine.  Cypherpunks are better off. By purchasing their bitcoin on unregulated venues like Bisq, they wouldn’t have to pay the tax. They would also benefit from casual buyers being pushed out of the bitcoin market, and the subsequent decline in the price of bitcoin. When copper or lead falls in price, users of these commodities benefit: They can consume more metal than before. Likewise for bitcoin. A tax-induced plunge in the price of bitcoin would allow cypherpunks to acquire and consume bitcoin-the-commodity at a far cheaper price than before.  Finally, the rest of the world would be better off. Pushing casual bitcoin tourists away from unnecessary consumption of PoW would free up huge amounts of electricity – both renewable and non-renewable – to be consumed by other industrial purposes. It’s win-win-win.

42376294,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A4V7,1645714800,What You Need to Know About Taxes Before You Claim Your Next Airdrop,"While crypto airdrops are often considered to be ""easy money,"" they also come with responsibilities.  In recent months, projects like Ethereum Naming Service (ENS) and LooksRare delivered airdrops of ENS and LOOKS tokens, respectively, to their users. Both of these token networks are now worth hundreds of millions of dollars in market capitalization. These airdrops have been successful in turning users into fervent stakeholders. As more projects continue to push towards decentralization, we expect more airdrops in 2022 and beyond.  This post is part of Tax Week. Miles Brooks, CPA, is director of tax strategy at CoinLedger.  Investors receiving airdrops should be aware of the tax implications of their newly earned tokens to avoid unwelcome surprises from the IRS.  How are airdrops taxed?  Most of the time, airdrop taxation is simple. When you receive an airdrop, you recognize income equal to the fair market value of the tokens received at the time you receive them.  Has the IRS released guidance on airdrop taxes?  The IRS has defined and used the term airdrop in official tax guidance (in Revenue Ruling 2019-24). However, the word “airdrop” was used only in relation to airdrops following a cryptocurrency hard fork. The agency hasn't provided official word as to how all airdrops are to be taxed. Most tax experts agree that when you receive an airdrop, the IRS will consider this income to pick up on your tax return.  How do I calculate my airdrop income?  To determine the fair market value of your airdrop rewards, look at what price the tokens are trading at when you receive them. Sometimes, there isn’t immediate pricing data available for early token projects. If this is the case, calculate the fair market value when a market does become readily available.  When do I recognize airdrop income?  In some cases, it can be tricky to pinpoint when you “receive” tokens. Generally, this happens when you have control over the asset – or in other words, when you are free to move or trade your tokens.  How do I report airdrop rewards on my taxes?  If your tokens are priced based on the value of another cryptocurrency such as ether, you’ll need to convert the price to U.S. dollar terms in order to report it on your tax return. Typically, airdrop income is to be reported as “Other Income” on Schedule 1.  Are airdrop rewards taxed again if I decide to sell?  If you decide to sell your airdrop rewards, you will incur a capital gain or loss at the time of sale. It’s important to note that you aren’t paying taxes on the same income twice. Rather, you’re incurring ordinary income when you first receive the airdrop and capital gain income once you sell depending on how the price of your tokens has changed since the airdrop.  For example, imagine that you are airdropped $1,000 of UNI from the Uniswap protocol. The value of your tokens then increases to $1,500 and you decide to sell. In this case, you would recognize $1,000 of ordinary income from the airdrop and $500 of capital gain from disposing of the tokens.  How do I determine my cost basis when I sell my airdrop rewards?  If you decide to dispose of airdrop rewards in the future, you’ll need to know the cost basis for your tokens. For airdrop income, this is the value of your tokens at the time you received them, plus any relevant fees.  In the prior example, by picking up $1,000 of airdrop income, this $1,000 becomes your cost basis for those tokens going forward. You can increase your basis by including any gas fees spent to claim the airdrop.  What happens if the value of your airdrop rewards declines significantly?  Your tax liability is based on the fair market value of the airdrop at the time you receive it. If the value of your tokens declines significantly, you may be responsible for paying a large tax bill you may not be able to afford.  To avoid this scenario, it’s recommended that you put aside a portion of your rewards when you receive your airdrop to cover the associated tax bill.  Many investors convert a portion of their airdrop income to stablecoins when they receive it, then find protocols that offer interest rewards. This way, investors can stay prepared for tax season while earning passive income.  What we don’t yet know about how airdrops are taxed  A difficult part about the taxation of airdrops is that their execution has changed over time and will continue to change. Some airdrops have to be claimed, and may only be available under certain circumstances, while others are automatically distributed to owners of a specific coin. The IRS has not yet released guidance on each one of these specific situations.  Potential taxpayer issues arise with unsolicited airdrops. The airdrop may show up on the blockchain, but in certain circumstances true “receipt” may not actually occur. For example, should you be required to report income from an airdrop if you don’t even know it was received?  Because of how nuanced airdrops can be, and because they are likely to continue to evolve as a tool going forward, it will be very difficult for the IRS to issue timely and well-reasoned guidance on airdrops.  You should speak to a tax advisor if you have questions about how your airdrop should be taxed. Everyone’s circumstances are different, and you will benefit from taking an approach that makes the most sense for you.  Will the way airdrops are taxed change in the future?  Even without explicit IRS guidance, there is a general consensus among tax experts that the IRS will treat airdrops as income when received.  It’s clear the current framework of taxing airdrops upon receipt comes with its problems. Could there be a simple alternative, tax airdrops not on receipt but only upon disposal?  It’s unlikely that the IRS will willingly accept such a deferral of income, and so for now, taxpayers who receive airdrops will have income upon receipt and will be forced to navigate through the uncertainty that comes with the taxation of an emerging asset.

42394288,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbDEF,1645713000,Are Crypto Investors Savvy or Suckers? The UK’s Tax and Financial Regulators Don’t Agree,"Are crypto investors financially savvy investors who are capable of understanding the nuances of blockchain, Web 3 and decentralized finance? Or are they mostly vulnerable, uneducated speculators who are being taken advantage of?  The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the U.K.’s financial regulator, believes they are the latter, while the U.K.’s tax collection agency, HM Revenue & Customs, or HMRC, believes they are the former. While the agencies have issued a few helpful guidelines, their differing opinions underscore a fundamental inability to provide more sweeping and effective oversight that would protect consumers and ensure the industry’s development. Delays in finding such common ground are slowing progress on both fronts.  This post is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week. Boaz Sobrado is a London-based fintech analyst and cryptocurrency enthusiast.  The FCA has found that most crypto investors have low degrees of financial sophistication and are naïve. Its research shows “a lack of awareness and/or belief in the risks of investing, with over four in 10 people not viewing ‘losing some money’ as one of the risks of investing, even though as with most investments their whole capital is at risk.”  For that reason, it is pushing for rules to force crypto companies to add disclaimers to their marketing. In other words, the FCA believes retail investors are so simple-minded that it is requiring crypto ads to include a warning sign telling people “they could lose all their money.”  HMRC, on the other hand, assumes these same people are sophisticated investors capable of accurately keeping records of every single taxable event across a myriad of offshore exchanges, decentralized automated market makers, and lending and staking protocols.  Read More: UK Tax Regulator Seizes NFTs for First Time as Part of Fraud Investigation  Retail crypto investors are expected to calculate their total gains based on the numerous provisions around day trading rules, bed and breakfast exceptions and the overall resulting Section 105 cost basis. Moreover, investors should understand that lending crypto assets is sometimes taxed as a ""disposal,"" a tax paid on an investment at an interval (even though the same is not true for stocks) and that the profits generated from lending are sometimes taxed as income, but also occasionally as a capital gain.  HMRC and the FCA disagree on many things with regard to crypto assets. Fundamentally, HMRC views crypto as property, not financial instruments, and doesn't think that interest received for lending can be classified as interest for tax purposes.  The FCA, on the other hand, views crypto assets as financial instruments and wants to regulate them as such. It has banned retail investors from accessing crypto derivatives on the grounds that they are “primarily used for speculative purposes akin to gambling.”  HMRC clearly disagrees, probably because gambling gains are not taxed in the U.K., as the tax authority has made it clear they consider derivative gains taxable. The guidance is still unclear, however, and crypto tax advisory firms debate whether crypto derivatives gains should be taxed as income or capital gains.  HMRC and the FCA didn't have such a wide difference of opinion in the past. In 2014, HMRC’s brief on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies stated that “a transaction may be so highly speculative that it is not taxable or any losses relievable,” and said that “gambling or betting wins are not taxable and gambling losses cannot be offset against other taxable profits.”  As the price of bitcoin grew from $400 in 2014 to $69,000 in 2021, the HMRC changed its opinion and decided that crypto assets were not gambling and thus taxable.  Read more: UK Financial Regulator to Limit Crypto Ads to Sophisticated, Wealthy Investors  In the last few years, both HMRC and the FCA have clearly put significant effort into studying the cryptocurrency and decentralized finance ecosystem. Both agencies are starting to issue guidelines and regulatory statements around the topic. These statements serve their institutional interests and fit within their practice, but happen to contradict each other significantly.  U.K. retail investors need some protection, particularly against the blatantly illegal fraud and pump-and-dump schemes that are happening openly with impunity. But retail investors also need protection from overcomplicated tax rules. Decades-old laws should be updated for the realities of the internet age.

42415778,ZC3JxkpHqXjrHiKmfGZ3aN,1645713000,Why We Still Need Guidance on Staking Rewards Taxation,"On Feb. 2, the Internal Revenue Service agreed to refund Joshua and Jessica Jarrett about $3,200 in taxes paid on Tezos (XTZ) staking rewards earned in 2019. The Jarretts filed suit against the IRS in May 2021 in the Middle District of Tennessee after filing and paying their 2019 taxes.  Phil Gaudiano is co-founder of the Polygon Advisory Group, a Virginia-based provider of tax and accounting services. He is a certified public accountant.  Almost immediately, crypto channels on social media erupted jubilantly, celebrating the mistaken belief that staking income was no longer taxable. Here are the high points:  The case was filed in U.S. District Court, not Tax Court.  The IRS attempted to settle the case by issuing the Jarretts the refund they had sued for, and the settlement was rejected by the Jarretts.  There was no decision regarding the taxation of staking rewards, and thus no precedent has been set.  Nothing has changed.  To understand the importance of the Jarrett case and its potential ramifications on the taxation of staking income, let’s examine the issue.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week  What is staking?  Staking refers to the process of locking up crypto assets to participate in a blockchain’s consensus mechanism, thereby validating transactions. In exchange for using the investor’s coins to validate these transactions and add them to the blockchain, the network rewards the holder of the coins.  In practice, the staking rewards earned by an investor are generally considered in one of two ways:  As interest income, similar to interest paid on cash held in bank accounts. This is the most commonly held opinion.  As compensation for the service of aiding the blockchain in validating transactions.  How are staking rewards taxed in the U.S.?  There is no definitive IRS position that specifically addresses the taxation of staking rewards. Rather, we must analyze staking income on the basis of the tax concepts involved, always adhering to the general principle given in IRS Notice 2014-21 that crypto is considered property for purposes of U.S. taxation.  In our tax practice, we have long believed that staking rewards are recognized as income on receipt, measured as the fair market value of the asset received as a staking reward. The following explains why:  Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code defines gross income. First, we will look at §61(a)(4), which states that interest received is included in gross income. It follows that if we consider staking rewards to be de facto interest payments, those rewards should be included in the gross income of the earner.  If we instead consider staking rewards to be payment for services, we will look at §61(a)(1), which says that compensation for services is included in gross income. Generally speaking, compensation for services is paid in cash (i.e. a paycheck). However, staking rewards are paid in crypto. No matter, §83(a) tells us that property transferred in connection with the performance of services should be included in income at its fair market value, less any amount paid.  Read More: 4 Crypto Tax Myths You Need to Know  So, whether you consider staking rewards to be interest or to be payment for providing service to the network, the rewards are considered to be income when earned. Beyond adding to the amount due to the IRS, the recognition of staking income has two main tax attributes in that it assigns a basis to the rewarded coins in the amount of income recognized and begins the holding period for capital gains treatment on the sale of the coins at a later date.  The Jarrett Case  Lawyers for the Jarretts argued that staking rewards should be seen not as compensation or interest, but as newly created assets like a farmer’s crops or an artist’s painting. While this argument will eventually be decided, either through the courts or through legislation, I don’t believe this argument has merit. As a side note, treating staking rewards as newly created property would have negative tax consequences in the long run. Farmers and artists recognize ordinary income (not capital gains) on the sale of their inventories, and both are subject to self-employment taxes.  The IRS attempting to pay the Jarretts their refund was a smart move. Had the Jarretts accepted, for the bargain price of $3,200, the IRS would have dodged having the issue of whether staking rewards are taxable being decided by a district court.  Read More: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  Instead, the case will now move to trial sometime in the spring of 2023. The IRS has effectively bought itself time to either a) wait for guidance/legislation, or b) catch another taxpayer with unclaimed staking income and bring the case to Tax Court, where a decision would set a federal precedent. So, for the time being, the Jarrett case has done nothing to change the way staking rewards are taxed in the U.S.  The more significant issue is the lack of official guidance around crypto as a whole and the ability for a small-time, somewhat frivolous lawsuit to make such big waves. Already social media and some crypto websites are festooned with posts and articles saying staking rewards are not taxable because of the Jarrett case. Those posts are wrong, but until we have clear legislation, regulations and guidance around these common crypto practices, not many people will understand why.

42417115,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS4x0H,1645712143,Lender Beware: The Potential DeFi Tax Trap,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a catch-all term that refers to a category of activities where decentralized applications provide financial services using a blockchain for transaction settlement. The defining features of DeFi are operation without centralized intermediaries (i.e., they run on smart contracts), peer-to-peer execution of transactions and the use of open protocols that allow flexible combinations of different protocols.  There are many different DeFi applications – this article will focus on DeFi lending transactions. Users often engage in many different loan transactions on many different platforms, trying to maximize the fees or rewards earned on these transactions. These users may not be surprised to learn that the fees or rewards are taxable, since interest earned on loans of money would normally be taxable. But the possibility that Uncle Sam may collect tax on every loan and repayment of cryptocurrency may catch users by surprise, creating a tax trap that could impair the rapidly emerging DeFi industry.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week  Many tax advisors have argued that, under decades-old tax guidance applicable to securities loans, loans of cryptocurrency should not constitute taxable exchanges. However, this argument may be stronger for centralized cryptocurrency (CeFi) lending than it is for DeFi lending. The IRS has not provided guidance on this issue, so taxpayers are left with uncertainty.  CeFi vs. DeFi transactions  In a centralized crypto lending transaction, a centralized party loans cryptocurrency to users. For example, a customer might use loaned BTC to enter into a short sale. After some time has passed, the customer will repay the loan, together with a fee or reward based on the amount of the loan and the length of time between advance and repayment of the loan (similar to an interest payment).  In a DeFi lending transaction, there is no trusted, centralized party to act as a lender. Instead, any holder can deposit cryptocurrency they intend to lend into a pool using a smart contract. Borrowers can then borrow cryptocurrency that is held in this pool. Under the smart contract, the lender will receive the platform’s native token (e.g., DAI, COMP or aTokens). These native tokens can later be redeemed so that the holder can receive back the cryptocurrency that they provided to the pool plus a fee or reward similar to the payment of interest.  Securities lending as a model  The IRS has concluded that cryptocurrency is treated as property for tax purposes and not as money. Although the loan of money and its repayment are generally not taxable, a loan of property may be. The IRS has not provided any guidance on the tax treatment of crypto lending transactions, so taxpayers and their advisors must look to analogies to determine the tax treatment.  Securities lending transactions proceed in much the same way as the centralized crypto lending transactions, so they are a natural analogy. Under section 1058 of the tax code, taxpayers providing securities loans generally can avoid recognizing taxable gain if they meet certain requirements. However, a “security” for this purpose is defined as “any share of stock in any corporation, certificate of stock or interest in any corporation, note, bond, debenture, or evidence of indebtedness, or any evidence of an interest in or right to subscribe to or purchase any of the foregoing.” Because cryptocurrencies typically do not fall within that definition of a security, taxpayers generally cannot rely on section 1058 for cryptocurrency lending transactions.  In the absence of a statutory rule, taxpayers and their advisors have looked to the common law rules that governed securities lending transactions prior to the enactment of section 1058 in 1978. In a 1926 case called Provost v. United States, the Supreme Court concluded that a securities lending transaction must be treated as an exchange, rather than as a loan, at least in the typical case where the borrower obtains an unrestricted power of disposition over the securities advanced.  Read more: You May Owe Crypto Taxes on These Surprising Things in 2022  Normally, treatment as an exchange means the transaction is taxable. However, the IRS consistently treated typical securities loans as tax-free transactions by broadly defining the parameters of the exchange. The IRS treated the securities loan as a deferred exchange, viewing the lender as exchanging the shares loaned for different shares of the same security that were later repaid. Because the property loaned and the property repaid were not materially different in kind or extent, this deferred exchange did not result in the recognition of gain by the lender.  Had the IRS broken the transaction down into two separate exchanges – first an exchange of the securities loaned for the borrower’s promise to repay, and then a separate exchange of this promise for the repaid securities – it likely would have resulted in a taxable exchange upon the loan and the repayment because the promise to pay is materially different from the underlying securities.  A crypto lender might rely on these same authorities to avoid the recognition of gain on a crypto lending transaction that is otherwise structured to comply with section 1058. The lender might be seen as entering into a deferred exchange where, say, the 3 BTC loaned is exchanged with another 3 BTC repaid at a later time. As long as the borrower makes repayment using the same cryptocurrency, it could be argued that this deferred exchange should not lead to the recognition of gain.  However, as mentioned above, in DeFi lending transactions, the lender may receive the platform’s native token, which can later be redeemed for the loaned cryptocurrency, but can also be traded in its own right. As such, it may be harder for a DeFi lender to argue that they have engaged in a single deferred exchange of the loaned cryptocurrency for the repaid cryptocurrency, rather than a pair of separate exchanges – a transfer of the cryptocurrency for the native token, and then the transfer of the native token for the repayment of the loaned cryptocurrency.  Larger implications  Taxing the loan and the repayment of cryptocurrency would add a significant amount of tax friction on DeFi lending transactions and could stunt the growth of this emerging industry. Although the IRS has not provided guidance, a few other countries, including the U.K., Norway and Australia, have concluded that the making and repayment of a DeFi loan may give rise to taxable income, starting a negative trend.  Congress should step in and create a legislative exception for crypto lending similar to the one for securities lending in section 1058. Such an exception would create certainty for cryptocurrency lenders and for the DeFi industry as a whole.

42417132,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS4wxB,1645711919,NFTs Are the Latest Crypto Tax Events Nobody Understands,"For over a year now, major tech companies and venture capital firms have been rallying behind non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as the next big thing in online commerce.  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has said the company’s new NFT business could be “as big or bigger” than its flagship crypto trading platform. Chris Dixon, a partner at the VC powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz, has predicted that NFTs will “onboard hundreds of millions of new users into crypto” – emphasis on the new.  Forget crypto arbitrage and complicated decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols; much of that dry, explicitly financial stuff remains niche, even now. NFTs are plastered all over major cities; they make appearances on late night talk shows; they inspire bacchanalian conferences; they’ve infiltrated iconic businesses; they even made it to the Super Bowl.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week  But for all the talk about NFTs, and for all the traders now sitting on a mountain of new tokens, there’s been relatively little discussion about how to stay compliant with relevant tax laws.  The lack of information around tax compliance is a problem unique to crypto. Traditional brokerages need to know a little about their customers so they can send out tax forms each year. Anyone who used Robinhood last year during the Gamestop short squeeze can attest: No gain is small enough to escape the IRS. I lost $40 on Gamestop stock last winter; Robinhood still sent me a 1099.  Read More: 5 Things to Remember When Paying Your NFT Taxes  Blockchain-based services like DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces are mostly peer-to-peer, which means they don’t need to collect the same level of information. Part of the novelty of crypto is that it has traditionally rejected know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements (some users tend to think of it as unnecessary financial surveillance), at least on the level of trades within crypto.  A digital wallet application like MetaMask or Rainbow can’t keep track of who’s using it, since it doesn’t actually know anything about its users beyond their public addresses.  It’s usually only when you cash out, from crypto to fiat currency, that you’re once again at the mercy of those pesky KYC-AML requirements. Contrary to popular opinion, crypto is actually terrible at laundering money. Mixing systems like Tornado Cash and Wasabi Wallet can help obfuscate the digital trail (and even they aren’t bulletproof), but at some point, you’re probably going to have to fork over some personal information. There are precious few truly anonymous fiat offramps in 2022. (Though if you want to give it a shot, there are still a few Austrian crypto ATMs that allow for non-KYC’d withdrawal directly into cash.)  So while Coinbase might send you a 1099, MetaMask and Rainbow will not. The same goes for decentralized applications and permissionless NFT marketplaces like Zora. OpenSea, though very much a centralized company, doesn’t ask for personal information, and so won’t send you a 1099.  Lucky for users – and for accountants in the burgeoning crypto tax industry – blockchains keep great records.  Shehan Chandrasekera, who heads up strategy at the crypto tax software company CoinTracker, explained that each NFT transaction involves multiple moving parts. Effectively, there may be three taxable events at the same time.  “Typically, you have the transaction – there's gas fees associated with that – and you're [converting] these NFTs to another type of cryptocurrency, mainly Ethereum: that also triggers a taxable event,” he said. “There could be royalties associated with that, and that triggers a taxable event.”  So you’re incurring at least a few taxable events with your average NFT transaction. After the purchase of the NFT, you’re paying taxes again on the sale of the NFT into liquid crypto, and again on the conversion of those gains back into fiat money.  Read More: The 7 Types of Crypto Tax Nightmares  There’s also the question of how to value illiquid gains in the form of NFTs you haven’t sold; unrealized gains aren’t taxed, but if you’re looking to donate an NFT, or pass it on after your death, you’ll need to get a handle on how much it’s worth (estate taxes still apply). Most NFTs in a given collection will sell around the “floor price,” or the lowest amount any token in a collection is currently listed for sale. But what about NFTs with especially rare traits? Who’s to say how much they’re worth, without a proper valuation?  “The hard part of NFTs is not really the taxable side of it, it’s the fair market value of what that NFT is worth,” said Dan Hannum, chief operating officer at CoinTracker competitor ZenLedger – that is, the reasonable price for an asset on the open market. “If you have NFT ‘ABC,’ and I give you a 100 ETH offer, and you don't accept it, does that mean it's now worth 100 ETH? You didn't accept it, so the hard part is tracking how much your NFT is currently worth.”  In the real estate world, official appraisers in the U.S. need a special designation – M.A.I., meaning “member of the Appraisal Institute” – before they can value a piece of property. A professional NFT appraiser might serve a similar function in crypto. (How else to divide up digital property, in the case of a divorce?)  Hannum added that “loot box”-style NFTs (NFTs that can be used to mint other NFTs, potentially with their own discrete values) add yet another tax wrinkle. And it’s reasonable to expect things will only continue to get more complicated over time, since developers are experimenting with new models for multi-stage NFT drops every day.  It’s daunting for traders, but also for accountants from the traditional tax world.  Tiffany Liu, a CPA who’s historically specialized in real estate taxes, has been handling all her boyfriend’s crypto taxes for the past couple of years. This year, she’s adding NFTs to her own tax treatment.  “It's kind of chaotic,” she said. “But essentially, [crypto taxes] are all based on existing frameworks. And very standard frameworks, like selling property. That's how I've been able to apply my experience.”  And though these things have a tendency to get very complicated very quickly, Liu maintained that she’s enjoying the chaos. She characterized it as a kind of group-learning experience.  “Prior to this, I'm like, ‘Oh, I have a boring job, I do tax compliance,’” she said. “To me, real estate was the most exciting industry. But now with this coming into play, it's a lot more people who maybe previously didn't have that many tax implications – all of a sudden, there's really significant tax implications, especially with the movement of ETH and all these crazy coins. I wish I could help everybody, because these are real consequences.”  The number of new recruits entering the NFT market has been a boon for crypto tax software companies (Chandrasekera said CoinTracker is already seeing an uptick in customers looking for help with NFT taxes, specifically), but there’s been relatively little tax-related messaging from NFT companies themselves.  Again, OpenSea and its competitors don’t have to help you out – but that’s not to say they’re not making an effort. CoinTracker recently announced a partnership with OpenSea, offering free tax reports for up to 50 transactions.  Read More: You May Owe Crypto Taxes on These Surprising Things in 2022  Chandrasekera says the responsible thing for these companies to do would be to distribute tax guidance the way platforms sometimes distribute free tokens to encourage adoption.  “They should airdrop a discounted tax plan to every wallet connected to these protocols,” he suggested. “That's the way for to [say], ‘hey, we know we created some taxable events for you, here's a tool for you to figure it out.’”  I asked Liu whether she thought – given all the activity around NFTs this past year, and the massive push to frame crypto collectibles as an on-ramp to a new decentralized internet, or Web 3 – the average newcomer might be prone to slip up on their taxes this year, shackled with tax obligations they didn’t know they had.  “I think there is some leeway,” she said, “some grace room for the fact that you tried your best. I feel like the IRS, and the government in general, is so crazy backed up – it's a mess. And at the end of the day, they're always going to go for the top players first.”  Which is to say, the IRS is going to be watching the whales, the traders with Bored Apes and Chromie Squiggles and millions of dollars on the line. Newcomers probably aren’t going to jail over a few miscalculated or misreported transactions.  Still, Liu acknowledged that it’s a confusing new world, even for tax professionals like her.  “We're all in this together,” she said.

42395934,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0CUJ,1645711575,Ex-Meta Coders Raising $200M to Bring Diem Blockchain to Life: Sources,"A team with intimate knowledge of the Facebook-initiated Libra stablecoin project announced plans to bring the network into the wild – albeit under a different name and seemingly with a different focus.  Fresh on the heels of the Diem Association’s confirmed winddown, a new team called Aptos said in a blog post on Thursday that it was taking another shot at bringing the ill-fated Diem blockchain to life.  According to two sources speaking on the condition of anonymity, Aptos is raising $200 million at a $2 billion valuation to do so. The people with knowledge of the deal said Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and several other crypto venture capital firms were involved.  Should Aptos find its footing, it would be a stunning reversal for Diem – a project that was much ballyhooed in 2019 but was fatally crippled by regulatory blowback in the subsequent two and a half years. Notably, the blog post makes no mention of the proposed stablecoins that riled lawmakers in the U.S. and abroad.  “We are not starting from scratch,” Aptos wrote in its “genesis” blog post, describing plans to launch the “safest and most production-ready blockchain in the world.”  “We are the original creators, researchers, designers and builders of Diem, the blockchain that was first built to serve this purpose,” they added. “While the world never got to see what we built, our work is far from over.”  The post doesn’t mention the team’s fundraising efforts.  One source with knowledge of the project said the Aptos team was building its new layer 1 blockchain based on the original Libra white paper. The pitch to prospective investors was “Libra without Facebook,” the source said. Unlike with Libra, however, the initial focus won’t be on cross-border payments but on non-fungible tokens, they added. General-purpose blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Flow and now Aptos are built to support multiple applications.  Read more: Diem Confirms Shutdown as Silvergate Acquires the Project's Assets  Aptos is being led by Avery Ching and Mo Shaikh, according to the Thursday blog post. Ching previously worked at Meta’s Novi crypto subsidiary and is credited with co-creating the Diem blockchain’s DiemBFT consensus protocol.  Shaikh is also formerly of Novi, but previously spent nearly three years as a director of strategy at ConsenSys, the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based Ethereum venture studio.  Much of the work undertaken by Diem-affiliated teams – be it by Calibra (now Novi) or the Libra Association (now Diem Association) – was placed under open-source licenses, and so the intellectual property can be used as the foundation of a new company.  The team applied for the Aptos Blockchain trademark last week, according to public records.  According to the blog post, Aptos believes new leadership can finally get Diem’s technology over the finish line.  “Since departing Meta (formerly Facebook) we have been able to put our ideas into motion, ditch bureaucratic red tape and build an entirely new network from the ground up that brings them to fruition,” they wrote.  UPDATE (Feb. 24, 14:28 UTC): Adds line on general-purpose blockchains supporting various applications.  CORRECTION (Feb. 25, 23:09 UTC): The Diem Association’s assets were sold and its operations were wound down, not Novi’s.

42416624,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWJEh,1645711200,Celsius Links Up With Maple Finance for Liquidity Play,"Celsius, a crypto lending platform best known for paying out yield considerably higher than bank savings accounts on stablecoin deposits, announced Thursday that it is committing $30 million of wrapped ether (wETH) to Maple Finance’s liquidity pools.  Maple Finance provides liquidity to market makers such as Wintermute and Amber.  In turn, Celsius would be able to get exposure to the yield generated by firms like Wintermute and Amber for its vast pools of capital.  “The interesting angle is that Celsius is using DeFi to run its lending infrastructure,” Sid Powell, Maple Finance’s CEO and co-founder, told CoinDesk. “It’s a big move forward where you have a CeFi lender acknowledging that they need to be in DeFi and turning to Maple to run their infrastructure.”  While the pool is starting at $30 million, Powell projects that it could be worth $500 million or even $1 billion after 12 months.  In November, Maple launched a pool in the form of a syndicated loan for Alameda Research, a trading firm, market maker and investor, which would give institutions access to Alameda’s yields in the form of a loan product.  Maple launched the pool for Alameda in November at $25 million, but Powell told CoinDesk it has since grown to $100 million.  Powell thinks there will be similar growth with Celsius’ pool, as they have $30 billion in assets they need to produce a yield on, he explained.  Maple Finance’s eponymous token MPL is down 7.6% on the day, according to CoinGecko, as part of a broader market downturn due to instability caused by the war in Ukraine.

42416631,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWJbA,1645711168,"First Mover Americas: Traders Prefer Gold, Fiat Safe Havens Over Bitcoin as Russia Goes to War","Good morning, and welcome to First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin drops, gold rallies as Russia attacks Ukraine  Featured stories: Bitcoin risks deeper drawdown as traders prefer commodities and fiat safe havens amid Russia-Ukraine crisis.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show ""First Mover,"" hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Today's show will feature guests:  Michele Schneider, managing director, MarketGauge Group  Dan Hannum, chief operating officer, ZenLedger  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Russia's decision to wage war on Ukraine has sent shockwaves through financial markets. While equities and bitcoin are down, gold, oil, base metals, agriculture commodities and currency market safe havens like the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen are trading higher.  Broadly speaking, markets are displaying the usual unease with geopolitical tensions. Some in the crypto community, however, may be disgruntled to see the top cryptocurrency again missing a haven bid.  Crypto pundits have long hailed the top cryptocurrency as a better inflation hedge and haven asset than gold. But price action, particularly since the influx of institutions and sophisticated players in the market after the March 2020 crash, suggests otherwise.  The cryptocurrency has moved more or less in tandem with stocks. Data tracked by South Korea-based analytics firm CryptoQuant shows bitcoin's 60-day Pearson's correlation coefficient with the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark index, now stands at a record high of 0.56.  ""BTC is getting adopted by traditional institutions,"" CryptoQuant said in a Telegram chat. ""It's being owned by new players who trade stocks. Bad news: BTC is not a safe-haven asset. For now.""  It's pretty clear institutional interest hasn't done for bitcoin what it was supposed to do, at least in the eyes of crypto investors – that is, establish the cryptocurrency as a digital safe haven better than gold.  The fact that fiat safe havens are doing better than bitcoin perhaps indicates that the cryptocurrency market as a whole is at the far end of the risk curve. Bitcoin was a largely uncorrelated asset before the COVID-19 crash and more so during the early bull cycles when institutional participation was almost nonexistent.  A continued risk-off might push bitcoin down to $30,000, which acted as a strong support zone in January 2021 and three months to July 2021. A potential break lower would confirm a double top breakdown on the weekly chart and invite more selling pressure.

Here’s How to Fix Them  Sotheby’s Withdraws Lot of 104 CryptoPunks Minutes Before Expected Auction  Prolonged Risk-Off Ahead?  By Omkar Godbole  Observers say the asset price declines brought by Russia's misadventure may have legs.  ""The problem is this [Russia-Ukraine crisis] is now coming at a very bad time for markets,"" Christian Mueller-Glissmann, managing director of portfolio strategy and asset allocation at Goldman Sachs International, told Bloomberg TV. ""The only way risky assets can make progress if central banks are tightening policy aggressively is if you have growth narrative and now you are dealing with a growth shock, particularly for Europe, but pretty much globally.""  Historically, the S&P 500 has delivered positive returns during most Fed tightening cycles, except the one seen in the early 1970s, when the U.S. economy grappled with stagflation – a situation in which an economy experiences a simultaneous increase in price pressures and stagnation in growth.  Russian President Vladimir Putin's war and the West's retaliatory sanctions on Russia, a major energy exporter, may exacerbate supply chain issues, bolstering inflation. The New York Fed's global supply-chain pressure index is at its highest since the 1990s, chart shared by The Daily Shot newsletter's Twitter handle shows. Brent crude oil has rallied above $100 for the first time since 2014.  ""There is no doubt that inflationary pressures will arise from a surge in commodity prices. Russia and Ukraine remain some of the largest exporters of various precious metals and agriculture. The current conflict is bound to affect global prices,"" Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, said.  Dibb added that the combination of war, supply constraints, booming commodity prices and zero rates is a textbook recipe for stagflation. While the crypto community still strongly considers bitcoin as a better store of value, past data shows the cryptocurrency is predominantly a risk-on inflation hedge, meaning it outperforms other assets when investors are willing to take risks.  The situation may not change anytime soon as traders are going for commodities or the so-called real-world assets in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Regulators worldwide, including Ukraine's, continue to take an anti-crypto stance and the Fed is unlikely to walk back on plans to raise borrowing costs this year.  ""We would hold shorts in most markets and consider long positions in precious metals.

42394282,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbCtj,1645710600,The Next Frontier: Digital Assets for Retirement,"Is bitcoin retirement gold or retirement kryptonite?  After a decade of being treated as risky investments by much of the financial industry, cryptocurrencies have finally achieved broad acceptance. That’s right – BlackRock, the biggest and most institutional of investors, is reportedly planning a cryptocurrency trading offering of its own.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it in your inbox every Thursday.  But the embrace of digital assets by traditional finance doesn’t end the arguments about their value, utility and staying power; it simply moves the goalposts.  One question still up for debate is whether crypto – and digital assets in general – belong in retirement accounts. To answer that question, we should first ask if digital assets are right for retirement.  An inevitability in retirement accounts?  Eric Satz, founder and CEO of AltoIRA, a digital self-directed IRA custodian that offers a crypto individual retirement account, said that there is $35 trillion in retirement accounts today, but less than 2% of that total is invested in alternative assets.  “If you compare that to the 10% number on the low end for high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth investors, to 80% for the Yale endowments of the world and pension funds, the everyday investor is missing out,” Satz said. “I don’t think it’s any surprise that we really are headed for a retirement crisis. It will only get worse if we don’t enable people to access high-performing opportunities at an affordable price.”  Crypto assets are probably going to end up in those accounts anyway, whether the financial industry likes it or not. Crypto IRAs are just the first of what will likely be many options for digital asset investors to keep their holdings in a tax-exempt or tax-free vehicle.  For one thing, a lot of people already hold crypto for retirement. In a January survey, retirement consultancy Capitalize found that over one-third of employees already have crypto holdings of some kind intended to fund their retirement.  Satz said that is happening because people are tired of retirement accounts that offer repetitive investment offerings.  “With the proliferation of mutual funds, indexes and ETFs (exchange-traded funds), all of that entire passive investing industry is comprised of some sub-segment of the same 400 meaningful public companies,” Satz said. “Once you get to a certain number of funds in a portfolio, adding more doesn’t get you more diversification, it only gets you another mutual fund.”  For true diversification that may offer less volatility and better risk-adjusted returns, people should be able to invest in the full gamut of alternative assets, Satz said. That’s why AltoIRA offers access to a range of different alternative assets in addition to cryptocurrencies through a partnership with Coinbase.  Attractive assets  A majority of people are going to hold cryptocurrencies as investments some day, Satz said, and a majority of people will see their potential value in a retirement account. These assets, by design, have some desirable characteristics: The built-in scarcity of bitcoin means that it will eventually be a bulwark against currency degradation, he noted.  “With institutions and more advised assets entering the space, volatility will decline,” said David Abner, global head of business development at Gemini, a crypto exchange and custodian. “We’ll see more stability. Recently, bitcoin set a new baseline around $40,000 and it’s now bounced above it. What I see is that more and more investors are positioned with a long-term outlook. We see lower volumes on sales during downdrafts over time, that means that many are either holding (or HODLing) or adding to their positions.”  Henry Yoshida, a former financial advisor and founder of Rocket Dollar, a savings option for gig economy workers that allows them to incorporate cryptocurrency, alternatives and traditional assets in the same low-cost account, argues that crypto has a place in retirement portfolios.  “If you want to take a portion of your assets to go into alts, the best moneys to use for that are IRAs and 401(k)s because there’s a long-term time horizon and great tax treatment,” Yoshida said. “Right now, brokerage houses and financial advisors aren’t really enabling that for their clients, even those who have become comfortable with cryptocurrencies and private real estate. In reality, I don’t think they’re failing to offer these assets because they believe they’re inappropriate. It’s really because they don’t have a way to offer a lot of these products and generate revenue.”  Attractive benefits, but tax considerations  Although the potential benefits to investors are undeniable, taxes are one of the drawbacks to trading crypto in the taxable account space.  “Every time there is an exit, a dividend, an interest payment or some type of capital appreciation that is liquidated, there’s going to be a tax,” said James Jones, senior vice president of investor relations at CalTier Realty, a digital alternatives issuer with roots in private real estate. “There are all these new alternative asset classes that people are trading like crazy without realizing that they’re generating these huge tax bills.”  In an IRA, there is no need to track trades, noted Jeffrey Levine, chief planning officer at Buckingham Strategic Wealth.  “If you believe that a crypto position is poised to go ‘to the moon,’ then owning it inside a Roth IRA could make a ton of sense, as the gain would be tax-free (provided you meet certain Roth distribution requirements),” Levine said. “That said, there are some downsides, as well.”  One of those is the still-open question as to whether non-fungible tokens can be held in IRAs and Roth IRAs, as such accounts are prohibited from owning collectibles, Levine said.  The power of tax-deferred growth  Yet traditional IRAs offer powerful tax-deferred growth, and Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth. Compounding the growth of a digital asset investment over the course of decades of retirement savings may have some promise as a solution to the retirement funding crisis.  If an investor is periodically rebalancing, doing so in a tax-deferred account helps avoid paying taxes on short-term capital gains that can come with buying and selling digital assets, Satz said.  “Why retirement accounts? Because you get to defer taxes initially in a traditional account, or avoid them completely in a Roth account,” Jones said. “Tax is the No. 1 biggest enemy of every investor.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/24/the-next-frontier-digital-assets-for-retirement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd53f3a675a3c2de68ba138cb15110eb47f85129-4463x3351.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42417114,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS4wzF,1645710600,What Advisors Need to Know About Crypto Taxation,"According to a recent study by Vanguard, financial advisors can add about 3% net return to clients’ portfolios; this is what Vanguard calls “advisor alpha.” Half of that return the investment advisor attributes to behavioral coaching (e.g., helping clients stay the course through market downturns). Approximately 95 basis points (bps) – close to what most firms charge to manage client assets – is due solely to advisors helping clients reduce the tax drag on their investments (i.e., via asset location and spending down assets efficiently).  Notably, these numbers are averages of estimates, and as the authors of the Vanguard study point out, there could be great variability in outcomes from one client to the next, and even one year to the next (e.g., the report shows a high end of 185 bps for investment tax planning). But what this study demonstrates is that nearly a third to a half of advisor alpha can be generated just from investment-related tax planning strategies alone!  So how can advisors capture as much of this tax alpha as possible for clients, particularly when those clients hold crypto assets? As we enter the 2022 tax season, below are some ideas that you can implement in your own practice.  1. Crypto is property for tax purposes  Per IRS Notice 2014-21, cryptocurrency is treated as property for tax purposes. This means that if an investor holds a crypto asset for over one year and exchanges it for another asset (crypto or otherwise), the investor would realize a long-term capital gain or loss. If the asset is sold after being held for one year or less, any gain on the sale is taxed at short-term rates, which is the taxpayer’s highest marginal tax rate.  One simple strategy to employ: hold crypto assets in a taxable account for over a year before selling them for a gain to take advantage of preferential tax rates (long-term capital gains tax rates are 0%, 15% or 20%, plus a net investment income tax of 3.8% might be applicable, depending on the taxpayer’s income). This strategy allows for tax gain (basis step up) or loss harvesting, which can add an appreciable amount of tax alpha.  Regarding tax loss harvesting, which is when an asset is sold at a price that is lower than its cost basis in order to offset realized capital gains elsewhere in the portfolio, there is a provision in the Internal Revenue Code that disallows an investor from recognizing a tax loss if a substantially identical security is purchased within 30 days of the asset sale. Instead, the repurchased stock or security retains the same cost basis as the asset that was sold originally. This provision is known as the wash sale rule.  Because crypto assets are deemed to be property and not securities for tax purposes, the wash sale rule does not apply. However, that could change since the 117th United States Congress would like to close this loophole.  Read more:US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  2. Asset location is crucial  Asset location is another extremely important aspect to consider when advising clients and can add a tremendous amount of tax alpha. Asset location is the concept of putting assets in specific types of accounts (i.e., tax-deferred, taxable and after-tax or tax-free) based on the tax attributes and expected growth of the asset.  For example, a bond (not a municipal bond though!) is best suited for a tax-deferred account because bonds generate interest income that is taxed at ordinary rates. While a growth-oriented stock or fund would be well-situated in a tax-free account such as a Roth individual retirement arrangement (IRA) because when the asset is sold and distributed from the account, no income taxes are incurred (though an additional 10% tax may apply if certain conditions are not met) by the taxpayer.  Here’s how asset location would come into play with crypto.  Let’s suppose your client is looking for yield and has parked money in a stablecoin and then lends the stablecoin out at an annual percentage yield of 8%. Ideally, the stablecoin would be held in a tax-deferred account because the interest income would be taxed at the client’s highest marginal tax rate if held in a taxable account, which is the same rate if a distribution is taken from the tax-deferred account. Effectively, the tax rates match, which is what you’re aiming for.  Now, let’s assume that your client wants to invest in bitcoin (BTC) and lend it out to generate some extra income. BTC has experienced tremendous – though highly volatile – growth over its lifetime. Some investors believe that it will continue to see significant price appreciation as compared to traditional assets. In this scenario, it might be a smart move for your client to invest in BTC using a self-directed Roth IRA and then lend the BTC out because there’s the growth play of the crypto coupled with the interest income generated from lending.  Read more:4 Crypto Tax Myths You Need to Know  Moving forward  These are examples of some simple strategies that don’t require much tax acumen but can add a lot of value to your client’s bottom line, potentially even in excess of the fees you’re charging them. Investment tax planning is an integral component of advisor alpha, and whether the investments are stocks, bonds or crypto assets, the strategies can pretty much be universally applied.

Bitcoin fell 9% in the past 24 hours, touching weekly lows of $34,725 in early Asian trading. Other major cryptocurrencies also slumped, with ether losing 13%, Solana’s SOL 15%, and Cardano’s ADA 18% – the most among the biggest cryptos by market capitalization.  “The threat of war had already been hanging over investors,” said Susannah Streeter, a markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown in an email to CoinDesk. “The shock of the invasion sent the price of oil hurtling up by more than 7% way above $100 a barrel, reaching more [than] $103 before falling back a notch.”  “Market volatility has increased since the beginning of the year, stoked by rising interest rates, and today’s news has added fuel to the market turbulence,” she said.  Some analysts noted that geopolitical tensions have been among the major fundamental reasons for a slide in cryptocurrencies, which have shed nearly $1.4 trillion in value from November 2021 highs, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  “The prospect of geopolitical escalation has been the main driver of price moves in the broader risk asset spectrum for the past couple of weeks,” said Anto Paroian, chief operating officer at crypto investment fund ARK36, in an email to CoinDesk. “Now that the war between Russia and Ukraine has become reality, investors are rushing to take risk off the table, and stock markets globally are seeing major declines.”  Meanwhile, traders said bitcoin was more lucrative as an asset compared with other major cryptocurrencies, despite the drop.  “Right now, the markets have the highest demand for liquid instruments, making bitcoin slightly less of a risk than altcoins,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior financial analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk.  “It is likely that a further deterioration in the financial situation could benefit the first cryptocurrency as a means of capital savings for investors from Ukraine, Russia, and some nearby countries,” he said.

A group of EU member states is seeking to give the bloc's new anti-money laundering (AML) watchdog oversight into cryptocurrency firms, according to the report, published Tuesday.  The group is led by Germany and includes Spain, Austria and Italy, Bloomberg said, citing an unidentified EU diplomat. ""They want the EU watchdog’s remit to cover the riskiest cross-border entities among banks, financial institutions and crypto assets service providers,"" the diplomat said.  The establishment of an AML authority was proposed by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm responsible for proposing legislation, in July 2021. The authority's mandate is the direct and indirect AML supervision across the bloc's 27 member states.  The proposal does not go into detail when it comes to virtual assets.  EU leaders have accelerated efforts to regulate all aspects of crypto. Lawmakers are pushing for a ban on cryptocurrency mining, while discussions on a comprehensive package for regulating the industry at the EU level, are set to kick off this month.

42416623,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWJBU,1645707844,"Russia to Restrict Crypto Trading to Licensed Platforms, Certified Wallets","Russian residents will be limited to conducting digital currency transactions through licensed operators, a restriction that in effect renders peer-to-peer trades illegal, according to the Ministry of Finance's proposed bill on regulating cryptocurrencies. Only certified cryptocurrency wallets will be allowed.  While the document, titled ""On the Digital Currency,"" hasn’t been published on the parliament website, a legal expert who obtained the draft shared it with CoinDesk.  The Ministry of Finance earlier this week said it introduced the bill regulating crypto trading and mining despite the objections of the Bank of Russia, which insists on a full ban on cryptocurrency trading, mining and ownership.  The bill defines digital currency as property and electronic data stored in an information system that can be used as payment while not being a legal tender in the Russian federation, or as an investment tool without any entity backing it.  Digital currency operators that facilitate transactions must maintain annual financial reporting, such as traditional businesses as well as satisfying other criteria. Notably, committed felons cannot chair digital currency operators. That includes people charged with terrorism financing and extremism – allegations that have been used broadly against political opposition in Russia in recent years.  Offshore companies also won’t be able to operate as crypto intermediaries.  Cryptocurrency exchanges will need to have no less than 100 million rubles ($1.2 million) in assets and professional traders no less than 50 million rubles in assets to be approved for trading.  It will be possible to buy cryptocurrency on these licensed platforms only using accounts at Russian banks, according to the bill. Trading platforms must provide records about users and their transactions to the anti-money laundering agency. The platforms must make a special note about funds coming from miners’ addresses.  Miners, in turn, will have to report their income to the tax authorities. Russian data centers can provide facilities for miners only if they are owned by Russian entities. Big miners must register in a dedicated list of miners. Small “home” miners don’t have to do that, unless they exceed a certain threshold in electricity consumption, which isn't specified in the bill.  According to Russian lawyer Mikhail Uspensky, the bill's approach is the most serious and comprehensive one he's seen over the half-a-decade he's been participating in legislative discussions around crypto in Russia.  ""There is a powerful coalition in the executive branch of power against the total crypto ban,"" Uspensky told CoinDesk. ""There is a dedicated working group in the government for cryptocurrency regulation in general, not just this particular bill.""  The bill has a narrow focus on regulating fiat-to-crypto on-ramps, but also, importantly, it touches mining for the first time, Uspensky said.  ""Creating official registers [for cryptocurrency exchanges and miners] are a normal regulatory practice in Russia,"" he said, though the bill will most probably change as it goes through the legislative process and won't be passed in its current format.

42416615,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWIsE,1645705565,Pantera Capital Says Some Crypto Selling Pressure Has Been Tax Related,"Some of the recent selling pressure in cryptocurrencies is due to unanticipated tax positions, hedge fund Pantera Capital said in its February blockchain letter. Tax day, April 18 in the U.S. this year, can influence crypto prices, it said.  Some $1.4 trillion of cryptocurrency capital gains were created last year, the fund said, adding that meeting the resulting tax bill could have caused a ""decent chunk"" of the recent sales.  The money manager noted that after previous big run-ups – in 2013, 2017 and 2020 – bitcoin peaked 35 days before tax day, and then fell as investors sold assets to cover taxes accrued. Cryptocurrency prices tend to fall leading up to tax day, it added, a pattern that's likely to be seen this year, too, after 2021's rally.  ""A lot of crypto traders are new to investing,"" according to the letter. ""You can imagine a person buying as much bitcoin as they can. Sometime later they decide to swap it for ether. And then their tax preparer tells them they owe 34% of the gains in taxes. ... Since the investor is 'all-in' on crypto, the only way to raise cash for the tax bill is to sell some crypto,"" the fund said.  A lack of guidance on everything from staking rewards to non-fungible tokens (NFT) means there's a certain amount of guesswork involved in tax filings.

The company announced the launch of its “Sports Pass” collection on Thursday, a series of one-of-one 3D-rendered NFTs designed by animation studio 8th Frame that grant holders exclusive perks on OneOf’s new sports-themed NFT marketplace.  Along with pro sports partnerships, OneOf says it has a series of college team sponsorships in the works, a growing area of interest in the burgeoning sports NFT landscape.  The first of its college partnerships is with the iconic Duke University basketball program.  Polygon, not Tezos  OneOf’s sports marketplace, announced earlier in February in partnership with Sports Illustrated, will live on the Polygon blockchain. The decision marks a departure from Tezos, the blockchain where the company has made a name for itself with its music marketplace.  “We love Tezos, but there was a desire to diversify a bit and bring in a different buyer pool,” Joshua James, co-founder of OneOf, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We think it makes the tent bigger, and we like that as an idea. We think it’s going to be a multi-chain world.”  Polygon, a layer 2 expansion system for Ethereum, is becoming a popular choice for smaller NFT marketplaces focused on high-quality, low-cost collections, coming off a $450 million funding round raised earlier this month.  OneOf’s sports marketplace has already signed partnerships with famous athletes including Wayne Gretzky, Mia Hamm and the estate of Muhammad Ali, cornering what many describe as the “normie” NFT market aimed at the general public.

42422871,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qYxh,1645703342,EU Parliamentarians Push to Limit Bitcoin Use Over Energy Concerns,"European Union (EU) lawmakers are preparing for inter-institutional discussions on proposed regulations for governing crypto assets, and may be set to ban energy-intensive cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory package up for discussion includes a provision that could limit the use of the consensus mechanism known as proof-of-work (PoW) across the union’s 27 member states, according to a draft seen by CoinDesk.  Various lawmakers and regulators in the EU have been calling for a ban on cryptocurrency mining since at least November of last year.  ""However, nobody expected it to become a deal breaker and to make it into the final report,” said Patrick Hansen, the head of growth at Unstoppable Finance and a contributor for RegTrax, Stanford University’s working database on fintech policy.  One proposed provision seeks to prohibit crypto services that rely on environmentally unsustainable consensus mechanisms starting in January 2025. The provision specifically refers to PoW, used to mint popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.  PoW cryptocurrency mining is under the microscope of regulators worldwide over energy concerns. Debates over energy consumption started after electricity use in creating bitcoin was compared with the annual energy consumption of some sovereign nations. After China banned crypto mining in May 2021 citing energy concerns, mining activities moved to countries such as the U.S., Russia and Kazakhstan.  EU lawmakers began focusing on energy concerns following an open letter from Swedish regulators in November 2021, which called for a bloc-wide ban on cryptocurrency mining. The call gained momentum, winning support from politicians in Germany, Spain and Norway. Crypto advocates pushed back, saying regulators might be rushing into a ban when regulation would suffice.  EU parliamentarian Stefan Berger, the lawmaker responsible for handling the procedure and content of the MiCA legislative package, said debate on the energy issue has escalated.  “The Greens and Socialists, as you can imagine, are criticizing the proof-of-work concept and criticizing the energy use, saying that bitcoin needs more energy than the Netherlands,” Berger said in an interview last week, referring to the political parties pushing the energy argument.  Berger said he does not feel MiCA is the place for settling technological or energy-related rules, as the package seeks to regulate crypto as assets.  Introduced in 2020, the framework seeks to establish oversight of the crypto industry at the EU level. The proposal, introduced by the union’s executive arm, the European Commission, lays out rules for cryptocurrency issuers and service providers, and even specifies rules for stablecoins (cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of real assets like the U.S. dollar). More ambitiously, the framework seeks to establish a licensing system so that crypto firms can expand through member states with greater ease.  According to the proposed rule, an exception is likely to be made if these cryptocurrencies are operated at a small scale, in a manner that does not undermine the bloc’s ability to reach its renewable energy goals. It is unclear how lawmakers intend to distinguish between small and large-scale operations.  Another provision, supported by Berger, requires white papers of PoW crypto assets to include an independent assessment of the network’s potential energy usage.  “What I want is that in the white paper, in the philosophy, we should make clear if it's a validation process which needs more energy or not … I hope that we can make a compromise,” Berger said last week.  Three-way discussions between the European Commission, Council and Parliament on finalizing MiCA are set to begin at the end of February, Berger said.  “I still hope and expect that this amendment will be dropped or drastically weakened in the upcoming trilogue negotiations,” Hansen said, adding that banning bitcoin goes against MiCA’s goals of promoting technology and fostering consumer protection.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/24/eu-parliamentarians-push-to-limit-bitcoin-use-over-energy-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c8176b5398f4ca3bf074aab7b222817e7964e76-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The prospect of damage to the global economy also weighted on broader financial markets, with the Stoxx 600 Europe index falling more than 3%, micro Nasdaq 100 futures down 2.3% and Russia's MOEX equity index dropping a record 28%.  In the past 24 hours, bitcoin fell 8%, touching $34,725 in early Asian hours. The fear & greed index – a tool used to calculate public sentiment of the crypto market – fell 2 points to a “fear” level reading of 23.  “The aggravation of tension around Ukraine exerted pressure on risky assets,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, a financial analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk. “There are growing risks of escalation associated with the introduction of Russian troops into Donbass. In such a situation, risky assets may continue to decline further.”  Donbass refers to two breakaway regions of Ukraine under the control of separatist groups.  The slide in cryptocurrencies shows the sector remains a nascent asset class compared with traditional markets, Kuptsikevich said. “We see that cryptocurrencies are selling stronger than developed world stocks, confirming the risky nature of these assets and how they are not a replacement for gold.”  Liquidations, or losses on crypto-tracked futures, reached over $250 million in early Asian hours as major cryptocurrencies tumbled more than 10%. In the past 24 hours, ether lost 12% of its value, with Cardano’s ADA and Solana’s SOL falling as much as 16%.

The attacker successfully imitated an OpenSea email inviting users to move their NFTs to a newer smart contract. The fraudulent e-mail by the hacker caused 254 tokens to be stolen from OpenSea&apos;s users.

The company is partnering with Archax, which is the first and only digital securities exchange and custodian to be licensed by the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and InvestaX, an investment and trading platform licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), to set up the International Security Token Offering Alliance (ISTOA), an international consortium, BC Group told CoinDesk in a statement.  The consortium members have also formed a working group to determine best technical and regulatory practices on the issuance, listing, trading and settlement of blockchain-based digital securities.  Security tokens represent ownership in a company, as opposed to utility tokens that can be exchanged for services or paid out for performing certain actions. The market for security tokens is still ""fledgling,"" BC Group's CEO Hugh Madden told CoinDesk.  The consortium is aimed at building up this market, and finding key interoperability and anti-money laundering (AML) principles so that the tokens can be traded across borders, Madden said.  “There's technical blockchain interoperability concerns and standards, then there's corporate governance and regulatory concerns. If I'm an operator that has a license to trade security tokens in the U.K., the tokens that I'm able to trade and/or issue will have slightly different characteristics and requirements than tokens issued in Hong Kong versus Singapore versus other jurisdictions,"" he said.  Anti-money laundering is the aim of the Financial Action Task Force's ""travel rule,"" which is currently rolled out in jurisdictions around the world.  Eventually, the goal is to set up industry standards, but right now ""there's lower hanging fruit,"" such as what technology, corporate governance, and AML/FATF characteristics of an issuance must be harmonized in order to list security tokens across Hong Kong, the U.K., and Singapore within the existent regulatory frameworks, Madden said. This year, Madden hopes to see such security tokens listed across the three jurisdictions.

42416627,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWJL7,1645688684,Bitcoin Falls 7% as Russia Invades Ukraine; Experts Say Fed U-Turn on Rate Hikes Unlikely,"""The Federal Reserve Chairman Putin announces cancellation of March rate hike and extension to QE,"" actor and producer Joel Heyman tweeted early Thursday after Russian President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine sent bitcoin and stocks plunging.  Heyman's sarcastic tweet calling Putin the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve mirrors the current crypto market sentiment, where traders are hoping the geopolitical uncertainty and asset market instability would force the U.S. central bank headed by Jerome Powell to abandon plans to unwind liquidity-boosting stimulus measures. That might bode well for bitcoin because the cryptocurrency has dropped 40% in the past three months, predominantly on the Fed rate hike fears.  Bitcoin was down 7.2% over the past 24 hours to $35,742 as of press time, after earlier touching one-month lows under $35,000. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks fell 1.3%.  However, experts do not foresee a complete U-turn by the Fed. ""It's hard to imagine the Fed completely walking back on its plans for a hike in March,"" said Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds. ""There is no doubt that inflationary pressures will also arise from a surge in commodity prices. Russia and Ukraine remain some of the largest exporters of various precious metals and agriculture.""  Indeed, it's turning out to be a Catch-22 situation for the Fed, as, on the one hand, the geopolitical uncertainty poses a threat to financial market stability and the economy. At the same time, on the other, it can very well add to the already elevated inflationary pressures worldwide.  Brent oil has crossed the $100 mark for the first time since 2014, data provided by chart platform TradingView show. According to Goldman Sachs, conditions are in place for a commodities' super spike.  ""This is the worst-case scenario, a massive tail risk,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger said. ""Crude and food grain prices are likely to stay higher for longer.""  Kruger, however, added that crude and food grains do not represent core inflation and the Fed may ignore a spike in their prices. It remains to be seen if the central bank turns a blind eye toward the volatile components of inflation in the coming months. ""Its impossible to gauge the Fed's response now and we will get a feel once the officials start talking about it,"" Kruger said. Core inflation is widely touted as the best gauge of demand-side pressures and a more reliable indicator.  According to Stack Funds' Dibb, the question now is not necessarily whether the Fed will or will not hike, but rather by 'how much' instead.  Shallow tightening cycle  Observers foresee a shallow tightening cycle with fewer rate hikes than expected.  ""The scripted rate hikes will still happen ... most likely 2-3 hikes. But the market's expectations of 6-9 hikes have little chance of playing out,"" Jeff Dorman, CIO at digital asset management firm Arca, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  As of Wednesday, the markets were priced for six quarter percentage point interest rate hikes for 2022. However, with Putin announcing war on Ukraine, rates traders appear to be pricing out the sixth rate hike, according to the Fed funds futures data. Further, the market is already pricing a rate cut in 2024.  Expectations for a shallow tightening cycle and shift in focus from inflation to geopolitics could perhaps bring some relief to bitcoin and other asset prices once the initial knee-jerk reaction to the Russia-Ukraine war runs out of steam.  ""The market is already pricing in rate cuts in 2024, indicating that rate hikes won't even have an impact because the market is pricing in a reversal already,"" Dorman quipped.  Per Ben Lilly, an economist at Jarvis Labs, Russia-Ukraine tensions are a welcome distraction for the Fed.  ""Fewer eyes focused on the inflation concerns from day to day. Also, the uncertainty of geopolitics, in general, could curtail spending to a degree,"" Lilly noted in a Telegram chat. ""The conflict might actually give the Fed a bit of a reason for inflation running hot.""

Bitcoin-tracked futures saw $72 million in liquidations – the most among all cryptocurrencies – followed by ether futures at $70 million. Altcoin-tracked futures saw comparatively lesser liquidations than bitcoin and ether, with losses on Solana’s SOL futures reaching $6.46 million, XRP futures reaching $5.18 million, and Dogecoin’s DOGE futures reaching $6.81 million.  Liquidations in the crypto market happen when a trader has insufficient funds to fund a margin call – or a call for extra collateral demanded by the exchange to keep the trading position funded. They’re especially common in high-risk trading due to the high volatility of assets. It occurs in both margins and futures trading.  Thursday morning’s moves contributed to over $411 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours. Some 114,700 traders were liquidated, with the largest single liquidation order occurring on OKX, a LINK trade valued at over $3.21 million.

42394284,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbD3z,1645678955,Play-to-Earn Games Are Missing the Point. Here’s How to Fix Them,"Last year, a hot new category in gaming became the subject of great interest in tech, crypto and investor circles. The thesis behind play-to-earn (P2E) is clear and well known: Players earn income or assets through gameplay, thanks partly to blockchain-based rewards, including tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFT).  Investment poured in with early entrants Axie Infinity (Sky Mavis), Blankos Block Party (Mythical Games) and others raising hundreds of millions at unicorn valuations. Many developers, from startups to large studios (Zynga, Ubisoft, even Amazon) signaled plans to move in. Crypto maxis swooned about a future in which anyone could earn a living by “grinding” away on such games.  Jason White is founder and CEO of TallyUP, a new, free play-to-earn game and has spent more than two decades exploring how game mechanics can be a force for economic good.  The premise of game players being paid real financial rewards for their time and attention is profound. P2E can be a powerful force for good, offsetting inequality, introducing millions to crypto risk free, and potentially emerging as an aspect of universal basic income.  However, many now question whether P2E is a Ponzi or pyramid scheme that risks doing more harm than good. To unlock the true potential of P2E, we must understand where such concerns arise and improve designs accordingly.  Fun and games, until someone loses a house  The reality of modern P2E is that earning has less to do with playing than investing. Players must first spend considerably, up to thousands of dollars, buying NFTs or paying a third-party guild to rent them. And to earn any return, some group of future players must spend more to keep it all going. And so on, in perpetuity.  The greater fool theory tells us this dynamic won’t end well. Fluctuations in market sentiment can decimate capital. For example, as of this writing, crypto markets are sharply down, and with them, the two primary tokens (AXS and SLP) used in popular P2E game Axie Infinity.  When ‘‘earning‘’ is based on appreciation, market downturns mean players can lose everything. That’s some game!  That such a thing can happen in the play-to-earn model is counterintuitive. And that developers of such games (even if they are good people with the best intentions) can bank billions in revenue despite the risk and potential loss incurred by players is troubling.  We have all heard the narrative that Web 3, blockchain and decentralization are the great financial equalizers of our time – something I truly believe. Amid growing concern about automation, global inequality and centralized power structures, P2E asks whether there is a way ordinary people can earn and share in the value they’ve helped create with their time and attention.  But the reality is that most P2E games benefit a central operator at the expense of their many individual players. This is the antithesis of Web 3.  A declaration of P2E gamer rights  Web 3 is fundamentally about dividing spoils equitably in multi-party systems. True Web 3 apps must ensure all stakeholders (end users, players, partners, team members, suppliers, whoever) are fairly valued and rewarded, but this will not happen by accident, or as an afterthought, if the singular goal is profit.  This does not mean P2E has to be charity work. And for the record, a game must, above all, be incredibly fun and exciting to play (and, ideally, to watch). Otherwise, no amount of rewards will keep players around. But taking steps to honestly value the contributions and wellbeing of end users is what will make Web 3 games so much better than their Web 2 counterparts.  These four player-first design principles will ensure a more sustainable, impactful P2E ecosystem, one that lives up to the ideals of Web 3:  100% free: Playing must be decoupled from spending or investing as a condition to earning. There is nothing wrong with games in which players can spend or invest, but there should be no in-game advantage for doing so. Pay-to-win mechanics suck. They make games less fun and sustainable, and they exclude many people who aren’t able to risk capital.  Extremely fair: A P2E game is an economic system with multiple actors, competing interests and finite resources. Mechanics that decide who gets how much of the pie must be fair, and place all participants on an even playing field. For real economic impact, games should be learnable, playable and reasonably winnable by anyone regardless of age, gender, tech savvy or culture. And not cheatable.  Fully transparent: All key financial data should be shared openly. How money is generated by the system and how it is distributed/earned should be clear. So long as rewards are shared equitably with players, this will increase trust, engagement and revenue opportunities.  Purposefully decentralized: Blockchain should be used to benefit players and developers alike. For example, game outcomes and transactions can be made openly verifiable on chain, and players can be meaningfully involved in ownership and governance.  A bright future for P2E  A barrage of investment schemes posing as fun games is a recipe for disaster. Players and even economies can pay dearly, especially in fragile communities and developing nations where early adoption is greatest. Businesses, meanwhile, risk inviting further skepticism and regulatory intervention to an industry already viewed with distrust. But now there is a chance to learn from early efforts and correct course.  People talk a big game about Web 3. Decentralization is a profoundly important cause worth the fighting. It will become a reality when industry unites to build systems that fairly and honestly balance the spoils for everyone. Everybody can win. And they must.",NEGATIVE,AXS,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Jason White,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/24/play-to-earn-games-are-missing-the-point-heres-how-to-fix-them,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/524610f132d590cc4c3aed3c8bf7774efcf6287a-612x408.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416636,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulWJkn,1645662736,Sotheby’s Withdraws Lot of 104 CryptoPunks Minutes Before Expected Auction,"NEW YORK — A collection of 104 CryptoPunks expected to be sold for up to $30 million was put on ice Wednesday during a much-anticipated auction at Sotheby’s.  A Sotheby’s representative said the seller decided to withdraw the lot. The auction was announced on Feb. 8.  The lot, which Sotheby’s titled “ Punk It!https://www.sothebys.com/en/digital-catalogues/punk-it?locale=en,” was acquired by collector “0x650d” back in July 2021 through a single $7 million transaction.  In a tweet after the initial publication of this article, the pseudonymous collector said they changed their mind:  Perhaps contributing to 0x650d’s reversal were rumors of a tepid reception for the CryptoPunks mega-lot. Three sources, including one bidder on site at Sotheby’s, told CoinDesk that the highest pre-bid offer was $14 million, which was also the reserve price.  Read more: Sotheby’s to Auction 104 CryptoPunks for Estimated $20M-$30M  Since the project’s inception in 2017, CryptoPunks, created by Larva Labs, has generated over 683,000 ether (ETH) in sales volume, roughly $2 billion at the time of writing. The project currently boasts a floor price of 67.5 ETH ($207,000).  This was supposed to be the second time Sotheby’s has facilitated the sale of a major non-fungible token (NFT) lot, with the first being a $24.4 million collection of 101 Bored Apes sold in September. Rapper Ja Rule was among those in attendance at the New York auction house.  To say Sotheby’s has leaned into the growing world of digital art and crypto would be an understatement – the famed auction house reported over $100 million in NFT sales in 2021 alone, and on occasion has even accepted bids for non-NFT related artwork in ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain.
