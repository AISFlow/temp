42402548,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdKInP,1548718281,Troubled Crypto Exchange QuadrigaCX Goes Offline for 'Maintenance',"Troubled crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, whose customers have faced withdrawal delays in both fiat and crypto for months, has been inaccessible for several hours.  The Canadian company, which has faced a prolonged banking fight and said its CEO and founder died last month, blamed a system upgrade for the Monday outage. It was not immediately clear when the exchange would go back online.  The company did not post any updates about the situation to its Twitter or Reddit pages, though users of both platforms complained about issues accessing the platform throughout the day.  Moreover, the status message on the website appears to be fluid. A previous message timestamped 21:07 UTC on Jan. 28 explains that ""an upgrade is being performed on QuadrigaCX and we should be back online shortly,"" alongside an apology ""for any inconvenience.""  However, a later message simply states that the site is down for maintenance:  Earlier this month, QuadrigaCX said on social media and through emails sent to customers that it was making progress toward returning their money, after resolving a legal fight with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), which previously froze funds held by the exchange's payment processor.  However, messages on Reddit Monday indicate that customers continue to have issues withdrawing their funds.  An email sent by interim CEO Aaron Matthews on January 15 said the exchange would work to return customer funds ""within two weeks"" – a period that ends tomorrow.  However, Jose Reyes, owner and managing director of Billerfy, the payment processor working to endorse the bank drafts on Quadriga's behalf, said at the time he did not have a firm timeline on when funds might be returned.  ""[N]o banks have the appetite to take the drafts so we are looking around for crypto-friendly banks,"" he told CoinDesk then. As such, he could not commit to the two-week timeframe laid out by Matthews.  The company was expected to hold a shareholders' meeting on Friday to elect new officers, following a petition to the Supreme Court of British Columbia filed by Jennifer Robertson, identified as the widow of QuadrigaCX founder Gerald Cotten and the executor of his estate.  The petition claimed Cotten's death left no officers with the company. However, it is not clear if the meeting took place and, if so, what the results were.  Requests for comment to QuadrigaCX and Reyes were not immediately returned.  Editor's note: This article has been updated to clarify that both fiat and crypto withdrawals at QuadrigaCX have been delayed in recent months.

42402536,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdKIeY,1548707419,Nvidia Says Q4 Crypto Miner Demand Was as Weak as Expected,"Nvidia had more disappointing news for investors Monday, but for once the cryptocurrency mining slump was not directly to blame.  In updated guidance released Monday, the graphics card manufacturer warned it now expects to report only $2.2 billion of revenue for its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, which ends Jan. 31, down from a previous estimate of $2.7 billion.  The earlier forecast had already factored in a drop in demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) used in crypto mining, Nvidia said, and sales of the extra graphics cards have kept pace with those expectations.  ""Exiting Q3, we estimated channel inventory would be largely depleted within one to two quarters, or between February and April,"" CEO Jensen Huang wrote in a letter to shareholders. ""Our view of that today remains unchanged.""  The problem is that economic woes and uncertainty, particularly in China, hurt demand for GPUs among Nvidia's other customers – gamers and data centers.  ""Q4 was an extraordinary, unusually turbulent, and disappointing quarter,"" Huang wrote.  Nvidia will report its full fourth-quarter results on February 14.  The company has been warning of a ""substantial decline"" in revenue from cryptocurrency miners for some time now.  Nvidia anticipated bringing in $100 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2019, but only saw $18 million.  ""Whereas we had previously anticipated cryptocurrency to be meaningful for the year, we are now projecting no contributions going forward,"" chief financial officer Colette Kress said during an earnings call last summer.  Its competitor, AMD, had likewise cautioned that a drop in demand for GPUs by miners would ""materially"" impact its GPU business.

There's plenty of useful data accumulating on blockchains, but the database structure doesn't make it simple for everyone to collect and utilize. A team called The Graph is building open source software that indexes all that information so it can be quickly accessed by anyone building decentralized applications.  In an announcement post Monday, Multicoin says that companies using this data for their applications have had to build their own data tools for accessing what they need. The Graph proposes to index everything in a way everyone can use forever, so no one will need to build such a tool again.  Multicoin partner Kyle Samani writes:  ""Virtually everyone in the web3 development community has come to recognize how important and underserved this layer of the web3 stack really is. The Graph has emerged as the market leader, with dozens of teams using the service in closed beta right now.""

""Web3 is an evolving platform that’s open, secure, stable, and verifiable but it's still difficult to build usable applications with this nascent technology,"" Tal told CoinDesk in an email.

42402515,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdK7yP,1548697817,Ex-Starbucks CEO and Presidential Hopeful Howard Schultz Is a Crypto Fan,"At least one potential U.S. presidential candidate thinks cryptocurrencies might be widely used in the future.  Starbucks chairman emeritus and former CEO Howard Schultz, who announced Sunday that he was considering making a run for the highest office in the U.S., has previously said that he sees cryptocurrencies as a future part of a cashless, digital economy, though he did not see bitcoin as a ""legitimate"" cryptocurrency.  The former CEO of the popular coffee chain discussed cryptocurrencies and blockchain during a quarterly earnings conference call in January 2018, telling investors that while he does not see bitcoin becoming a widely-used currency, he does think the underlying blockchain technology had numerous potential uses, in particular with helping his company transition to new payment models.  Schultz went so far at the time as to mention that cryptocurrencies would be incorporated into the company's long-term digital payments strategy.  ""I'm talking about ... the possibility of what could happen — not in the near term, but in a few years from now — with a consumer application in which there's trust and legitimacy with regard to a digital currency,"" he said, adding:  ""I'm not bringing this up because Starbucks is announcing that we are forming a digital currency or we're investing in this ... I'm bringing this up ... as we think about the future of our company and the future of consumer behavior.""  More recently, his company appears to have warmed even to bitcoin. As revealed last summer, Starbucks has been working with Intercontinental Exchange, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, on Bakkt, the upcoming bitcoin futures exchange. The retailer will help develop ""practical"" applications to convert digital assets into U.S. dollars at the point of sale, the companies said at the time.  Hitting the road  Schultz, who announced he was ""considering"" a run as an independent centrist candidate on Sunday, has also written a new book, which was released Monday.  Without mentioning the book, he said in a video posted Monday that he would soon embark on a ""listening and learning"" tour of the U.S.  ""In the next few weeks and few months, I'll be traveling the country. I'll be listening, and learning, and meeting many of you,"" he said. ""I look forward to seeing you and I strongly believe that this is an opportunity in America at a very fragile time, to embrace a better choice, not the status quo which will lead to decline, but a better choice that I think will lead to a season of renewal, leadership that you can trust and once again government that can be working for all the people.""

At 3:00 UTC, the token sale platform opened its doors to BTT investors through two separate sale sessions, one for those paying with the token native to the Tron blockchain, TRX, and the other for those paying with Binance’s native exchange token, BNB. Each BTT token was valued at $0.00012 during the sales, according to sale informationhttps://launchpad.binance.com/details.html?projectId=41 posted on Binance's website.  BTT is the first token in BitTorrent's 17-year history. The decentralized file-sharing service was acquired by Tron last summer and plans for BTT, which runs on Tron's blockchain, were rolled out in a white paper earlier this month.  Both of today's sales began at the same time and were scheduled to end either once the hard cap of the sale was reached or when the clock struck 10:00 UTC on February 3. The minimum purchase amount was 100,000 BTT.  According to a tweet from Tron CEO and founder Justin Sun, the 23.76 billion token cap for the BNB session was reached in just 13 minutes and 25 seconds, while the 35.64 billion token cap for the TRX session was fulfilled in 14 minutes and 41 seconds.  Information from Binance reveals there were 622 participants in the TRX session and 340 participants in the BNB session.  Binance CEO and founder Changpeng Zhao tweeted the sale could have ended in just seconds if not for technical issues with the Launchpad platform.  At 3:20 UTC, Zhao tweeted:  “Both sessions concluded. Took about 18 minutes, due to a system issue, would have taken 18 seconds otherwise. Demand was astronomical.”  In an attempt to be transparent about the inconvenience, Zhao added:  “Full transparency. The issue experienced today was caused by the 'user agreement confirmation' button caching/locking. Most of the stress tests focused on the buy process, this part was not covered thoroughly enough. The order of requests received was preserved.”  The first of many airdrops to TRX token holders will take place on February 11, at which time 10.89 billion tokens or 1.1 percent of the total circulating supply will be airdropped. Subsequent airdrops will occur through 2025, according to a January 20 post by the BitTorrent Foundation.

42402517,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdK81M,1548690098,Crypto Startup Wants You to Trade on Exchanges Without Trusting Them,"A new protocol aims to allow crypto users to maintain control of their private keys while trading on centralized exchanges.  Arwen, a startup formerly known as Commonwealth Crypto, launched a testnet version of its namesake protocol Monday. CEO Sharon Goldberg described it as ""a layer-two protocol specifically for trading.""  In other words, trades will take place off-chain. As Goldberg explained:  ""You put a smart contract on a blockchain where it locks up coins and once it’s locked up, you can do all sorts of transactions … without posting those transactions to the blockchain.""  All the while, the user will always have full custody of their coins, said cryptographer Ethan Heilman, one of the authors of the company's white paper. Boston, Massachusetts-based Arwen has developed an app which acts as the user portal, and will generate the users' private keys from a seed phrase, ""and as long as they have those words, they will be able to recover their funds,"" he said.  As such, Arwen says, its technology will enable traders to take advantage of the high levels of liquidity available on centralized exchanges without having to trust those frequently-hacked platforms to safeguard their funds.  ""Even if the exchange is hacked, even if the exchange is malicious the entire time and goes offline, we don’t care,"" Goldberg said. ""What would happen is Arwen would freeze those coins and give you a time window for when you’d recover the coins.""  While non-custodial trading is also a feature of so-called decentralized exchanges, Arwen notes that such platforms lack the liquidity of their centralized counterparts. Also unlike DEXs, the protocol utilizes atomic swaps for greater security and speed.  While at launch, Arwen will not be open source, Goldberg said the plan is to publish the code behind its daemon at some future point.  At present, Arwen supports transactions made with bitcoin, litecoin and bitcoin cash, with plans to roll out support for zcash, ethereum and ERC-20 tokens.  Launch partner  At launch, crypto exchange KuCoin will be integrating a beta version of the Arwen protocol. The exchange's president and founder, Eric Don, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson that the move may increase user trust in crypto exchange services.  ""It's totally understandable to question about the security of such operation. What if the security level of this exchange is not strong enough and gets hacked? What if the exchange takes my money and shuts down? We know some people may have such concerns,"" he explained.  Don said the exchange conducted security audits on the protocol, and has assessed the overall plan's feasibility.  To integrate the protocol, KuCoin had to develop systems to support the ""Request for Quote"" model, as the exchange currently uses a ""Central Limit Order Book"" model. The two companies will continue to work together to continue to integrate the system, he said.  Goldberg noted that the integration process is only beginning, but expects KuCoin to launch full support on testnet by the beginning of the second quarter (around the beginning of April).  Despite the touted benefits to the protocol, Don was cautious about what sort of reception the protocol might see among KuCoin's users, concluding:  ""I have to say that this is a bold move in the crypto world. We do not expect a mass adoption among our users in the short term, but we believe as blockchain technology continues to progress, the Arwen system will bring confidence to crypto investors with convenience as well as security.""

Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Upbit jointly announced Friday that they will create a hotline to share real-time wallet information on suspicious crypto trades. They aim to identify trades with suspected links to phishing, predatory lending, pyramid schemes and other illegal activities and share related information via the hotline, the exchanges said.  The exchanges will also operate a shared database of suspicious wallet addresses that would, for example, be able to help them identify and halt scammers looking to use different exchanges to move a large quantity of cryptocurrency to the same wallet.  The four firms are planning to encourage other crypto exchanges to join the initiative.  The news comes a month after CoinDesk Korea organized a forum with the country’s lawmakers on know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) initiatives. Seven crypto exchanges at the time signed an agreement to ensure user protection.  Back in November, the Korean Bar Association, the body governing South Korean lawyers, called on the government to hasten the introduction of blockchain regulations and “prevent side effects involving cryptocurrencies.”  And last June, South Korea’s financial regulator amended the anti-money laundering rules that apply to cryptocurrency exchanges in the country, requiring domestic banks to tighten up monitoring of related bank accounts.

As a result, the hacker was able to access some user accounts and make transactions.  So far six user accounts are known to have been compromised LocalBitcoins said, adding that it is further investigating the attack to determine the exact number of accounts affected.

While this is not yet fully confirmed by LocalBitcoins, it said, ""For security reasons, the forum feature has been disabled until further notice.""  A Reddit user who said they owned one of the accounts to have been hit in the attack also stated: ""I'm afraid to use my 2fa code for the time being until the server is confirmed secure.""  ""When i first tried to logon with my 2fa code there was an error then when i tried again, my wallet was wiped clean. So these hackers move fast,"" they added.

42402510,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdK7vS,1548678020,Chat App Kik Says It Will Fight SEC Over Possible ICO Action,"Canada-based messaging app company Kik is planning to fight a likely U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement action over its 2017 initial coin offering (ICO).  According to a report from The Wall Street Journal on Sunday, Kik founder and CEO Ted Livingston said that the firm's token, kin, works like a currency and is not “an unregistered security” as believed by the SEC. Kik raised almost $100 million via a sale of the token last September.  With ICOs having diminished in number, in part due to the threat of regulatory actions, the final decision in this case could have an important knock-on effect on the crypto industry.  Notably, SEC chairman Jay Clayton said last February: “I believe every ICO I’ve seen is a security.” He added: “I want to go back to separating ICOs and cryptocurrencies. ICOs that are securities offerings, we should regulate them like we regulate securities offerings. End of story.”  Adding to the WSJ comments, Livingston said in a Medium post on Sunday that there are “dozens of projects at a similar point” with the SEC, and adding: ""We all believe that this industry needs regulation, but we also believe that this is not the way to get it.""  Making that case that kin is “truly is a currency,” he said that the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 “explicitly states that the definition of a security ‘shall not include currency.’”  Livingston further said that kin does not satisfy the Howey Test, the U.S. standard for determining whether something is a security.  The SEC got in touch with Kik after the launch of the ICO and most recently sent a Wells notice stating that Kik has violated securities law, the post states. Kik responded to the notice last month, saying that its ICO involves “no fraud,” and the claims ""unjustifiably target a Company that made substantial efforts in good faith to comply with all existing laws and regulations when selling Kin in September 2017.""  It continues:  ""The Commission will not and cannot demonstrate that Kin in and of itself or any specific sale or distribution of Kin fall within the purview of the federal securities laws.”  The post further said that, if the enforcement action is taken up, ""Kik and the Kin Foundation are prepared to litigate and are confident that they will prevail in court.""    The next step, according to Livingstone's post, is for the SEC staff to decide if they will make a recommendation to the SEC commissioners ""to authorize a case against us.""

42402525,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdK88F,1548673212,Bitcoin Price Looks South After Drop to Six-Week Lows,"Bitcoin ended a two-week period of consolidation with a drop to six-week lows earlier today.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell below $3,470 at 04:45 UTC, confirming a downside break of a triangle pattern. That range breakdown was followed by a quick slide to $3,357 – the lowest level since Dec. 17 – according to Bitstamp data.  A prolonged period of consolidation usually yields a big move in the direction of the breakout. For instance, BTC ended a multi-week-long trading range with a move below $6,000 on Nov. 14 and what followed was a violent sell-off to levels below $4,000.  However, the duration of the recent consolidation was shorter than the one seen before the big bearish move of Nov. 14. So, the magnitude of any post-breakdown move would likely be smaller too.  Nevertheless, the latest range breakdown could at least yield re-test of December lows near $3,100, as the primary trend represented by the downward sloping 10-week moving average (MA) is negative.  The bearish case looks even stronger if we take into account the bull failure seen over the weekend. Prices had turned in favor of the bulls with a move to $3,658 on Saturday. That triangle breakout, however, petered out, with prices falling back to $3,500 yesterday. A failed breakout is widely considered a strong bearish signal.  Possibly adding extra downward pressure on prices, safe-haven asset gold – which has been inversely correlated with BTC since November – found acceptance above $1,300 on Friday.  At the time of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,430, representing a 3 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  On the daily chart, BTC charted a bearish gravestone doji on Saturday, meaning the day began with a positive move but ended flat on the day.  Adding to the bulls' woes is the negative follow-through as represented by the drop to six-week lows today. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also reporting a range breakdown below 40.00.  So, the path of least resistance looks to be to on the downside, and the bulls will likely feel emboldened only above $3,658 (the high of the gravestone doji).  4-hour chart  As seen in the above chart, BTC’s triangle breakout on Saturday was short-lived and the cryptocurrency has now found acceptance under the lower edge of the triangle.  The chart also shows a Bollinger Band breakdown, with a convincing break below the lower band.  The RSI, however, is reporting oversold conditions. As a result, BTC may revisit $3,500 before resuming the drop toward the December lows.  Weekly chart  The 10-week MA is still trending south, indicating a bearish setup. There are, however, signs of indecision in the marketplace, as represented by last week’s classic doji candle.  Further, a sustained drop in trading volumes likely indicates bearish exhaustion.  The outlook, therefore, would turn bullish if BTC ends this week above the doji candle high of $3,658.  View  BTC risks falling to the December low of $3,122 in the next few days, having confirmed a range breakdown with a drop to six-week lows today.  A downward move could be preceded by a minor bounce to $3,500, as the RSIs on the 4-hour and the hourly chart are reporting oversold conditions.  The outlook would turn bullish if the oversold conditions on the 4-hour RSI end up yielding a convincing move above $3,658 (the high of both the gravestone doji and the classic doji).

42402516,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdK7zO,1548669601,Overstock's tZERO to Trade Tokens During Wall Street Hours Only,"Overstock's newly launched security token marketplace tZERO is live, but it's still a work in progress.  That platform launched in the late afternoon on Thursday, allowing investors to trade their tZERO tokens.  The first trade saw 10 tokens bought at a price of $8 apiece, according to the users in tZERO’s Telegram group. That $8 price is lower than it was during tZERO’s security token offering, or STO, when tokens were available for $10 each. However, participants of the pre-sale could buy them at prices between $5 and $8.  Orders at tZERO cannot be viewed by anyone other than approved users, and those with such approvals can see bids and asks as well as post their own.  In an interview, CEO Saum Noursalehi detailed the first hours of tZERO's operations, the current issues with which the exchange operator is facing, and how it sees the tokenization of securities as a driver of future revenue.  For example – in what might be a sign of the platform's position between mainstream Wall Street finance and the more open, experimental market embodied by the cryptocurrency space – tZERO will, at first, operate during normal market hours between 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. EST. It's during that period that the broker-dealer Dinosaur operates, Noursalehi explained.  He told CoinDesk:  “Our approach has been incremental: getting some benefits of blockchain but not going full-blown, and this is also something that made the regulators comfortable with letting us move forward. Initially we did it to kind of mimic the market, but Dino is our broker-dealer at this point and we wanted to make sure there is support available for investors during the broker's business hours.”  However, the technology allows tZERO to enable trading 24/7, and Noursalehi explained that this approach is a major goal. He also acknowledged that the launch itself wasn't spared from technical issues, as some users complained about account confirmations and days-long wire transfers.  “There are always little tech issues around a big launch, but they have actually been very minimal,” Noursalehi said, noting that tZERO has been trying to speed up the process.  “For example, during the AML/KYC checks we had a lot of rules in place, so there were too many applications going through the manual review,"" he went on to say. ""We helped them [Dinosaur] to tune those rules so that they don’t have to manually review so many applicants.”  After tZERO’s STO last August, when it reported to have raised $134 million from over 1,000 accredited investors, the tokens were issued on October 12, 2018 and locked up for three months.  On January 11, investors got emails saying that they could gain control of their tokens and set up a brokerage account with tZERO’s partner, the broker-dealer Dinosaur Financial Group that would facilitate trading.  New exchange in the works  TZERO has been designed as an alternative trading system, or ATS — a trading venue subject to less regulation than an exchange, matching customers’ trade without policing their practices and usually registered as a broker-dealer. In addition to that, tZERO deals exclusively with private equity, eschewing publicly traded companies.  But the ambitions of the founders – including Overstock chairman Patrick Byrne, the firm's blockchain visionary – go beyond this limited scope: aiming to disrupt the whole traditional system of security trading.  To that end, tZERO is working to launch an exchange for publicly-traded stocks.  Announced last May, tZERO partnered with BOX Digital Markets, a subsidiary of the Boston-based equity options marketplace, to create and go live with such a marketplace.  “We’re working closely with the regulators to get that up and running,” Noursalehi said, adding that the new exchange – dubbed the Boston Security Token Exchange, or BSTX – will use the same technology stack as tZERO and will be the first exchange in the U.S. to trade this kind of digital asset.  The same companies might take advantage of both tZERO and BSTX at different stages of their business, Noursalehi noted, adding:  “As companies become publicly traded they would move from our ATS (tZERO) to BSTX exchange.”  More traders, more tokens  According to Noursalehi, tZERO will spend the coming months working to become its own retail broker-dealer. The goal is that, in August, retail investors can begin trading at tZERO – as it stands, only accredited investors can do so.  The team is actively developing tZERO’s technological capacity to help other companies issue their security tokens. TZERO is viewing this as a key source of future revenue, as traders are currently not being charged trading fees. Though no decisions have been made on this front, the introduction of fees is possible in the future.  “We make revenue through some of our traditional businesses,” Noursalehi explained. “A lot of the money in this space comes from doing token offerings: if we can offer it as a service to the companies that want to raise capital, you can drag significant revenues from it.”  Right now, Noursalehi said, making big profits isn't a near-term priority for tZERO.  “We’re going to shift to more monetization later,"" he told CoinDesk. ""At this point it’s more about proving the concept and drive adoption.”  tZERO image via CoinDesk Archives",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/28/overstocks-tzero-to-trade-tokens-during-wall-street-hours-only,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e70c7d7cb3cb0c65ab365a49a25b2188a13bf5ea-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a recent note to its clients, the firm said that it was skeptical of the value of cryptocurrencies apart from in a ""dystopia"" where investors have lost confidence in “all major reserve assets (dollar, euro, yen, gold) and in the payments system,” according to a report from Business Insider on Monday.  The banking giant further said that, though cryptocurrencies have a low correlation to traditional asset classes such as shares and bonds, they are not the best bet for diversification. ""Low correlations have little value if the hedge asset itself is in a bear market.”  JPMorgan also reportedly said earlier this week that, with prices so low, bitcoin is worth less than the cost to mine it.  Bitcoin and the wider crypto market have spent the last year in a bear market. After reaching a record high of about $20,000 in December 2017, bitcoin is down 83 percent and is currently trading at around $3,420.  JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is famously anti-crypto. Back in September 2017, he declared bitcoin a “fraud” and said, “It’s worse than tulip bulbs. It won’t end well. Someone is going to get killed.”  Later in January 2018, Dimon said he regretted calling bitcoin a fraud, yet he remains skeptical on the topic. Most recently, he asked investors to stay alert. “I don’t wanna be the bitcoin spokesman. You know, just beware,” he said.  JPMorgan, as an institution, however, believes that cryptocurrencies might one day play a role in the diversification of global equity and bond portfolios, according to a February 2018 research report.

42402511,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdK7uT,1548651655,Don't Throw the Crypto Tokens Out With the Bathwater,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.    ___________    A year into the crypto market meltdown, we’ve gone from one extreme to the other.  Where investors and commentators were once consumed with the naïve belief that ICO-funded startups would quickly usher in a new token-driven decentralized economy and unlock untold wealth, we’re now at a point where any idea associated with tokens, good or bad, struggles for legitimacy and money.  It’s time to find the middle ground.  Token-economics is not some hocus-pocus concept. That bitcoin and ethereum’s incentive systems have sustained viable, decentralized communities exchanging value and building products is proof of that. But to assume people will quickly adopt similar models across all sorts of mainstream industries when their livelihoods currently depend upon incumbent centralized systems is also dangerously misplaced.  It would be a crying shame if we threw out token economics altogether. From the widespread mistrust in online media data to the fact that electric utilities obstruct the creation of independent solar microgrids, there is much wrong with the world that could potentially be overcome if digital asset systems enabled communities to enter into exchange without having to trust intermediaries.  Choose Wisely  The challenge is twofold: figuring out which models are most viable as a starting point and how to most effectively bring them to market.  I, for one, believe industries in which the traded product is already a fully formed item of digital value – such as online media, entertainment or gaming – are a logical place to start. But at the same time, token solutions for these or any industries cannot be simply introduced with a build-and-they-will come mindset. The struggles that Civil faced in introducing a complex, token-based reward system for decentralized journalism suggest that a gradual, transition-based model is needed rather than a bold vision to change the system in one fell swoop with a solution that ordinary people struggle to understand.  Many projects would do best to build a market that first makes old-fashioned fiat money, but with a clear, fully signaled game plan to later introduce a token model that clearly improves the existing customers’ experience and enables the business to scale within a decentralized structure. A game developer, for example, who builds an enthusiastic community around a particular online game, could later introduce tokens, fungible or non-fungible, enabling users to trade digital goods for off-platform services or rewarding them for widening the community.  In other words, token startups – the vast majority of whom have failed to generate anything near a critical mass of users – should aim to build a pre-token community first or at least build a token model on top of an existing community.  That, in turn, brings in real-world questions associated with accessing financial resources and sustaining self-funded growth.  How do you initially fund business development? Venture capital? Founder money? Loans?  What business model is best to bring in dollar-based revenue without discouraging users from also engaging with non-traditional, token-based mediums of exchange?  Is token price appreciation – at the heart of many ICO business models – even a viable concept for encouraging user growth? Can tokens be treated as components of the system with their own internal source of value without encouraging users to cash out into dollars?  Harsh Reality  These tough questions are now staring most ICO issuers in the face, especially those that either didn’t raise enough funds, left too much of their treasury in significantly devalued cryptocurrencies, or both.  The kinds of options confronting them were highlighted in two stories this past week.  One was that Galaxy Digital, the crypto-dedicated merchant bank created by former hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz, has created a $250 million fund to provide credit to struggling crypto firms. In difficult moments, credit is always an option, so long as you have a viable product. Better to have one on friendly terms than a shark.  The other was that BEE Token, whose ICO of a year ago promised a decentralized home-sharing platform, has pivoted away from a token appreciation model to one in which it charges fees for its services. The new focus, CEO Jonathan Chou told CoinDesk, “is to have a sustainable revenue model.” The question left unanswered was whether this is a transitional step toward a token solution in the future or whether the dream of a decentralized Airbnb is over – and, as such, whether it is even viable to compete with the home-sharing giant on its own terms.  It’s important – unavoidable, in fact – that crypto companies are pivoting on their funding and revenue models to stay afloat in these difficult times. Let’s hope, however, that those adopting these more traditional approaches can resist the pressure, from within or from outside investors, to simply stick with the more centralized models these approaches entail.  Don’t let the market meltdown kill the vision of a new economic order.  Rubber duck image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Michael J.
