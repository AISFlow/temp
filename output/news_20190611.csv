42422908,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qz5h,1560290430,dOrg Founders Have Created the First Limited Liability DAO,"DOrg  , a company that builds DAO-related software founded by Ori Shimony, Asgeir Sognefest, and Jordan Ellis, has created what it calls the first Limited Liability Decentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO, a legal way to “reference blockchain code (smart contracts in our case) as the legitimate source of authority for their company’s operations and governance.”  The process melds the complexities of a DAO with the legal protections afforded to limited liability companies.  “After deploying its DAO to the Ethereum blockchain, dOrg formed a Blockchain-Based Limited Liability Company (BBLLC) in Vermont, dOrg LLC. By linking the DAO to this BBLLC, the DAO has official legal status, allowing it to enter contractual agreements and offer participants liability protections,” wrote the founders in a release.  The company is a cooperative of blockchain devs that builds DAO-related software. They claim that with this new legal framework users can create a legally registered DAO as easily as creating a “social media account.”  “We realized that Vermont’s BBLLC law was unique in carving out the option for companies to reference blockchain code (smart contracts in our case) as the legitimate source of authority for their company’s operations and governance,” said Shimony. “The Operating Agreement establishes that the Company will only accept requests to perform services for Clients, allocate work and renumeration to Participants, add new Participants, and distribute voting rights through the DAO’s decision-making engine.”  “We worked extra diligently to make sure that all legal agreements were very lightweight yet created no backdoors or special privileges that could short-circuit the authority of the DAO,” he said.  The team plans to share the process so anyone can create legally licensed DAOs. While they are a DAO software dev shop, it an intestine move that could make the creation of decentralized organizations easier and safer for users and investors.

42382091,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qagJ,1560288631,Pan-African Insurer Old Mutual Will Not Insure Mining Rigs,"Old Mutual, a legacy, pan-African insurance company, announced it will not insure equipment used for cryptocurrency mining, according to a statement released June 10. The company cites the expense, risk, and speculative nature of the industry.  Africa contributes less than 10 percent of the total bitcoin hash rate, according to Bitcoin Magazine. Many advocates for the fledgling industry think strict regulations, costly electricity prices, and mining rig price tags are preventing it from developing -- a problem that will only get worse if miners cannot take out protection on their gear.  Old Mutual is not the first to ban coverage for mining equipment or price premiums outside the reach of many hobbyists. Cryptocurrencies are often considered an asset class with a different risk profile than other forms of capital, and may carry premiums that reflect that risk.  Following extensive research, as well as an in-depth review of claims from clients that have incurred losses to equipment used for cryptocurrency mining, Old Mutual said it has begun advising its branches not to insure any businesses involved with the industry.  “We have chosen not to provide cover for this type of risk as it is quite tricky to conduct a proper risk analysis of an unregulated fledgling industry that is already on the radar of financial authorities due to the unfortunate association with money laundering and cyber crime,” said Old Mutual insurance expert Christelle Colman.  The insurer notes crypto mining operations typically utilize high-cost computers, servers and other equipment modified to run heftier application-specific integrated circuit devices that can overload the computer's central processing units or graphic processing units. Furthermore, running a system continually, which the company alleges is industry practice, introduces risks of overheating and other malfunctions.  “Even doing a comprehensive inventory of the insured equipment is difficult because the value of the highly modified computer equipment is typically inflated and almost impossible to verify as it is usually imported from obscure suppliers in the Far East,” said Colman.  Old Mutual is also concerned about the volatile, unregulated nature of the industry, which is often associated with speculative trading companies -- prone to going bust -- or worse, cyber crime.  Although insurers have come down on protecting mining equipment, CoinBase recently announced it has taken out $255 million for coins held in hot wallets on behalf of their customers -- signaling willingness by insurance companies to enter other crypto sectors.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/11/pan-african-insurer-old-mutual-will-not-insure-mining-rigs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ccd8d6f7fc1c2a11b0d3344a8ac46a1a20c7e212-1500x1013.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382088,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qabH,1560286816,University of British Columbia Adds Blockchain Program for Master's and PhD Students,"One of Canada’s leading research universities, the University of British Columbia, is launching a blockchain tech training path for graduate students.  According to the UBC, the program is a first in Canada. The track will focus on four areas: health and wellness, clean energy, regulatory technology and issues for Indigenous residents, and will officially launch next January.  ""The initiative will allow students to develop the skills around emerging technologies that are in high demand as well as drive economic growth as graduates fill the void in the industry,” said Victoria Lemieux, UBC iSchool associate professor and founder of Blockchain@UBC, in a statement.  UBC aims to train 139 students over six years, and build out services for existing master's and PhD students in educationally adjacent areas. Interested students do not need to come to the program with blockchain experience.  The initiative is supported by 15 industry partners from a wide range of sectors, including Boehringer Ingelheim, a pharmaceutical company with net sales of around 17.5 billion euros in 2018.  Mitacs, a not-for-profit that works with federal and municipal governments to support industrial innovation, will reserve a potential contribution of $1.324 million over six years to match industry funding on an annual basis for up to 18 master’s and eight PhD internships, including skills training and capacity for international experience. This represents a combined potential value of over $2.44M for 156 internships and post-doctoral training projects.  Additionally, Blockchain@UBC receives support through UBC's Grants for Catalyzing Research Clusters program. Its research papers and projects bring academics and industry partners together to explore issues in emerging blockchain technologies. Past educational initiatives have spanned undergraduate, graduate, and executive levels.  UBC's most recent initiative will be taught by UBC faculty from diverse disciplines, including natural science, FinTech, engineering and computer science, and information governance, as well as non-STEM fields.  ""Complex, wicked problems require a collision of perspectives,"" Victoria Lemieux told CoinDesk, referring to the challenges in blockchain education.

42382081,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qaST,1560284433,Ex-Employee Sues Startup Behind Zcash for $2 Million Over Unpaid Stock,"A former employee, Simon Liu, is suing the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company for $2 million over unpaid shares, breach of contact, and damages, according to court documents filed on May 29.  Zerocoin  is the organization behind the popular cryptocurrency Zcash (ZEC).  The complaint, filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Francisco, alleges Zerocoin founders made false promises regarding employee compensation and breached their fiduciary duty to employees.  Simon Liu joined Zerocoin as Senior Software Engineer in August, 2016. At that time, Liu entered into a contract with the company to receive “incentive stock options to purchase” 12,000 units of company stock. The company amended this agreement in October, 2016 to award Liu 15,000 units.  Liu, who resigned on May 28, 2019, now argues that “Zerocoin did not have authorization to issue common stock to employees in 2016, and that defendants were aware they did not have such authorization.” He also alleges that his superiors knowingly mislead him when saying he would receive a “Founders Reward” tied to the number of outstanding company shares then counted as 1,345,486 units.  “Defendants knew the representation was false when they made it, or made the representation recklessly and without regard for the truth [that over a million units of Zerocoin existed],"" argued Liu’s representative Seth Wiener in the complaint. He also said they “had no reasonable grounds for believing it was true.”  On December 31, 2018 the company provided a status update that admitted Zerocoin had not created a stock option plan for its employees and that no formal option grants had been issued. One month later, the company published another internal statement outlining plans to “issue new shares in the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, diluting everyone’s percentage of ownership interest.”  Before the lawsuit was filed, company representatives denied Liu’s request to examine their books and records.  In response to Liu’s ongoing requests for information, the company replied that they could not meet its promised obligations, “as the bear market has pushed [Zerocoin’s] current valuation down significantly from where it was when [Liu] began employment with [Zerocoin].”  Zcash currently trades around $79 and has an overall market cap of just under $600 million. Its all-time high in January 2018 saw valuations closer to $900 million.  Zerocoin is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. It changed its name in February from Zerocoin to the Electric Coin Company to avoid confusion between Zcash and the nonprofit Zcash Foundation.  Liu does not recall the “true names and capacities of defendants sued” and is also claiming the defendants operate under fictitious names, according to the court records.  The case is unrelated to an ongoing $900,000 lawsuit involving a former employee at crypto exchange Kraken suing over unpaid wages.

42382094,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qaip,1560282638,'It Feels Like Family': Bitcoiners Gather for Security Conference in Amsterdam,"A swift breeze swept across the canal and into a small Amsterdam pub, where about 30 bitcoiners sat drinking beers and registering for Breaking Bitcoin 2019. It smelled like rain.  From a British mom who works from home as a “bitcoin hobbyist,” to a ripped Kiwi technologist with a thick beard, people who work with bitcoin gathered to joke about Crypto Twitter and nodes.  They were in Amsterdam for one of the most prestigious security conferences in the blockchain industry. But on this rainy Friday, they had also come for something more.  “It feels like family,” the hobbyist trader said.  Many of them paid for beers and snacks with bitcoin, using a lighting-friendly wallet and a point-of-sale device developed by the Amsterdam-based startup Bitonic, founded in 2012.  “We may have lost some of the market,” Bitonic’s head of strategy, Daan Kleiman, told CoinDesk about the decision to focus purely on bitcoin, “but we have the freedom to make our own decisions without the pressure from venture capital. This makes our growth very natural and healthy in this complex market with a lot of scams and unrealistic promises.”  But growth wasn’t the main focus the following weekend at the conference itself. Instead, the panels and presentations at Breaking Bitcoin 2019 explored the premier cryptocurrency’s vulnerabilities, from political attack vectors to security holes.  At the operational end of the spectrum, there was bitcoin advocate Udi Wertheimer, who revealed Wasabi Wallet’s privacy features could actually be leveraged to de-anonymize users. (The wallet’s creator promptly replied on Twitter to discuss issues from the presentation.)  Then there were the higher-level challenges, such as the economic and social risks of bitcoin. On a panel exploring the topic, vagabond bitcoin consultant Felix Weis said if the majority of bitcoin users continue to trust custodians and exchanges to hold the private keys to their assets, then such companies could gain disproportionate sway over the technology’s evolution.  Each talk left the audience feeling that addressing this specific issue could bring bitcoin one step closer to long-lasting value. And although building a sustainable-yet-decentralized form of money is still an ambitious goal, at best, nothing excites bitcoiners quite like a seemingly insurmountable challenge.  Users and limitations  Despite how few people spend bitcoin today, with Chainalysis estimating merchant activity represents only 1.3 percent of bitcoin activity, many developers at the conference in Amsterdam use bitcoin for freelance work on open source projects.  Such was the case with both Weis and Lightning Labs co-founder Olaoluwa Osuntokun, who paid contributors to his startup’s implementation of the bitcoin scaling solution lightning. From Osuntokun’s perspective, regulation presents a larger barrier to bitcoin adoption than the small pool of users.  “The biggest risk likely comes from state-level actors attempting to stifle the development of software related to bitcoin,” Osuntokun told CoinDesk. “Network-level partitioning attacks, and attempts to control the import/export of mining equipment.”  During the social risks panel with Weis, Bitcoin Magazine editor Aaron van Wirdum concurred that new regulations like the upcoming requirement by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – which could force companies to share customer data across jurisdictions any time users send money from one exchange or custodian to another – presents a salient risk to bitcoin users’ privacy and the ability of companies to uphold a cypherpunk ethos.  Yet the vibe at Breaking Bitcoin was optimistic, even exuberant. Along those lines, several conference attendees were independent researchers presenting prospective solutions to small, specific problems with using bitcoin.  “I’ve progressed from someone who was excited about [bitcoin],” Seoul Bitcoin Meetup founder Ruben Somsen told CoinDesk, “to someone who explains it at meetups, to now potentially contributing something.”  Somsen was there presenting his idea for a bitcoin-related protocol for instant off-chain transactions without the hassle of lightning channels.  To conclude his presentation, in a way that epitomized the conference’s gamification of criticism, Somen answered audience questions poking holes in his proposal. After all, as Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo said during a panel about lightning:  “Bitcoin is still in beta … decentralization is an experiment.”  Olaoluwa Osuntokun (right) plays a lightning-based game by Donnerlab while onlookers bid from mobile wallets to play the next round.

Swanson, the founder and director of research at Post Oak Labs, has been on Clearmatics' advisory board since 2015. He will come on board full-time next week as head of market intelligence, he told CoinDesk.  ""It is a privilege to join a company that has had a consistent vision for the confluence of finance and technology,"" Swanson said.  Before starting his own consultancy, Swanson was the director of market research at enterprise distributed ledger technology (DLT) builder R3, a position he held from near the time that consortium began growing in 2015 until late 2017.  Clearmatics may be best known as the technology partner for Fnality, the consortium of financial institutions building an interbank ""utility settlement coin"" (USC) which raised $63.2 million in funding last week.  Swanson said he will not be working directly on Fnality’s USC project but will be focused on a number of other Clearmatics initiatives. ""Having pulled together regulators and institutions from across the world to incubate USC, I'm excited to contribute to the next generation of critical infrastructure,"" he said.  Clearmatics itself raised $12 million in a series A round last October.  Something of a divisive figure in the crypto space, Swanson was described by Michael J. Casey and Paul Vigna in their book “The Truth Machine” as “a vocal anti-bitcoin gadfly.”  A longtime student of blockchain, Swanson is also the author of ""The Great Chain of Numbers,"" published in 2014, an early look at ""2.0"" applications of the technology such as smart contracts.

42382092,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qadn,1560276035,Enigma Launches Second Testnet for 'Secret Contract' Blockchain,"Data privacy startup Enigma is officially launching its second test network for ethereum developers.  While the code for the second testnet developer release has been up on GitHub since last week, the Enigma team announced today new developer guidelines and walk-through documentation to supplement the release.  In interview with CoinDesk, Tor Bair – head of growth and marketing for Enigma – positioned the launch as a way for more developers than before to build specialized smart contracts called “secret contracts.” The Enigma project – originally incubated at MIT Media Labs – aims to create a secure, off-chain environment able to process sensitive and private blockchain data with end-to-end encryption.  These secret contracts are able to perform off-chain computations on encrypted data leveraging the Enigma protocol. While the protocol is not yet live on ethereum mainnet, the release sets up developers to start building code that can be then immediately deployed onto Enigma’s first networked protocol – dubbed Discovery – once officially activated.  “We’re releasing now the developer testnet release so that our partners and friends can get a jumpstart on development so that by the time Discovery is live on ethereum mainnet, we can have live applications [on the network] straightaway,” said Bair.  He added that unlike last year’s testnet release back in July 2018, today's release is considered to be “from a developer experience almost identical to what it will be when the public networked version of the [Enigma] protocol actually launches.”  Bair emphasized:  “The developer experience is pretty much set with this release.”  Having fundraised $45 million in an initial coin offering back in 2017, Discovery was actually expected to go live on ethereum mainnet last year. However, for a variety of different reasons, the Enigma team announced back in September a delayed timeline to better secure the long-term interests of the project.  Next steps  The next major milestone for the Enigma project is a subsequent launch on a public ethereum test network, akin to the Ropsten or Rinkeby network.  Today’s release only supports testing for secret contracts locally in controlled virtual environments.  As Bair notes:  “From here on out, it’s just about making sure that the network is stable and the peer-to-peer network works appropriately.”  To this point, there will be a set of “genesis nodes” which can be thought of as the computer servers running Enigma’s encrypted data computations.  These nodes – similar in behavior to miners on a traditional proof-of-work blockchain – are rewarded for contributing computing power to the network by receiving network tokens. In this case, ""worker nodes"" on Enigma are rewarded ENG tokens which presently possess a total market capitalization of close to $40 million.  During Enigma’s next code release on a public ethereum testnet blockchain, there will be what Bair calls a “genesis game” in which people who want to run Enigma nodes will compete to be among the first 50 nodes whitelisted for Discovery mainnet launch.  “The next phase is the deployment on the ethereum testnet which is geared entirely towards node runners,” said Bair. “We’ve been in conversation with a lot of staking-as-a-service providers, funds, independent node runners, ENG holders who have been excited to run nodes on the network for at least the past year and a half.”  While not committing to an exact timeline for this upcoming milestone or a possible date for ethereum mainnet activation, Bair did share with CoinDesk that the team is “doing everything in our power to get mainnet out in 2019.”  Image of Enigma CEO Guy Zyskind courtesy of Enigma",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/11/enigma-launches-second-testnet-for-secret-contract-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1d4ef2250aefaf5712026f0987c82f5650c87fa-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As reported by Reuters on Tuesday, the payments giant has launched its Visa B2B Connect network – a product that was originally developed alongside blockchain startup Chain.  Visa B2B Connect at launch will serve businesses seeking to make payments to 30 markets, according to the report, with 90 more corridors expected to be covered by the close of 2019.  The service has been designed to help Visa's corporate clients sidestep the slow correspondent banking network, opening up near instant international payments using a system in part powered by distributed ledger technology (DLT).  “By creating a solution that facilitates direct, bank to bank transactions, we are eliminating friction associated with key industry pain points,” Kevin Phalen, SVP, global head of Visa Business Solutions, was quoted as saying in a statement.  Phalen told Reuters that the network is not fully based on a distributed ledger, however the technology has been used for some elements as it allows more payment information than traditional systems.  And while Chain, which builds blockchains to support financial systems, had played a major part in the development of Visa B2B Connect in its early iterations, Visa ultimately turned to Hyperledger Fabric for the DLT side of the system with assistance from IBM. Visa notably took part in Chain’s $30m funding round in the autumn of 2015.  Visa B2B Connect was first rolled out in a pilot phase to test bank-to-bank connections in November 2017.

For the effort, Ripple has hired veteran fintech entrepreneur and executive Luiz Antonio Sacco as managing director to drive strategy and help develop Ripple's business in the region, according to a press release issued Tuesday. Sacco's LinkedIn profile indicates he has been at Ripple since March 2019.  Eric van Miltenburg, Ripple's SVP of Global Operations, said:  ""In January, Ripple surpassed 200 customers on RippleNet. The company is experiencing rapid customer growth across all markets, and is launching in Brazil in response to high customer demand in South America. We are fortunate to have Luiz on board to expand our presence in the region and help our customers address the challenges of cross-border payments.""  The company said it already has over a dozen Brazilian financial institutions and money transfer companies using its RippleNet product. These include firms such as the Brazilian arm of major bank Santander, money transmitter BeeTech and local bank Banco Rendimento.  Ripple said it will be exhibiting RippleNet at Brazilian tech event CIAB Febraban from June 11 to 13. RippleNet is a payments network designed to facilitate cross-border payments for banks and payment providers.  In the release, Ripple claimed it's adding ""an average of two to three new financial institutions to RippleNet each week,"" and saw more transactions on RippleNet in Q1 2019 than it did for the whole of 2018.  Looking ahead this year, Ripple plans to focus on building its customer base and team in Brazil and throughout South America, including in countries such as Chile, Peru and Argentina, the firm said.  The firm further said it's committing resources to top Brazilian universities, including University of São Paulo and Fundação Getulio Vargas to help support academic research and technical development across areas including law, business and engineering.  “We believe that academic institutions will play a key role driving the blockchain industry forward. USP and FGV are innovative, forward-thinking institutions that are investing in blockchain research to explore new use cases and help prepare students for future jobs in this space,” Sacco said.

42382098,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qalL,1560250831,No Man's Land: Bitcoin Price Locked in $600 Range for 7th Day,"View  Bitcoin has been trapped largely in the $7,500–$8,100 trading range since June 5.  A high volume falling channel breakout on the 4-hour chart, if confirmed, would revive the bullish outlook and open the doors to $8,500.  The 4-hour chart moving averages and trading volumes indicate the price is more likely to fall back to $7,500 in the next 24 hours.  A break below $7,500 would validate the bearish doji reversal confirmed by Sunday's close below $8,000 and allow a deeper drop below $7,000.  Bitcoin's (BTC) struggle for direction continues with prices locked in a tight £600 range for the seventh day running.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell below $8,000 and found acceptance below the historically strong support of the 30-day price average on June 4, opening the doors for a deeper correction.  However, since then, the downside has been largely restricted to levels near $7,500. Prices did print a low of $7,449 on June 6 before closing at $7,806, according to Bitstamp data. Further, Sunday's drop to $7,511 was short-lived with prices bouncing back to levels above $8,000 yesterday.  At the same time, the bulls have repeatedly failed to force a sustained break above $8,000 over the last six days.  With prices largely range-bound, the immediate outlook is neutral. A convincing break above the upper edge of the range is needed to put the bulls back in a commanding position. Conversely, a break below the lower edge would again open the doors for a deeper price pullback.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $$7,820, representing a 1.2 percent gains on the day, having hit a high of $8,057 earlier today.  4-hour chart  BTC is trapped within a falling channel on the 4-hour chart, and the price bounce from Monday's low of $7,511 has run out of steam.  Further, the moving averages (MAs) are biased bearish. For instance, the 50-candle MA is trending south, having produced a bearish crossover with the 100-candle MA on June 7. The 50-candle MA now looks set to cross below the 200-candle MA.  BTC, therefore, risks falling back toward the lower end of the recent trading range of $7,500–$8,100.  The case for a pullback to $7,500 looks stronger if we take into account the fact that trading volumes dropped sharply in the last 24 hours as the price recovered from $7,500 to $8,090. As seen above, volume bars have been printing lower highs since May 30.  The outlook would turn bullish if BTC exits the falling channel with a high-volume move above the upper edge of the channel, currently at $8,050.  Weekly chart  The previous week's candle closed below $8,000, validating the bullish exhaustion signaled by the preceding week's doji candle.  Despite the bearish doji reversal confirmation, BTC is flashing green this week. Prices, however, are struggling to find acceptance above $8,000 – the doji candle's low.  The bearish view would gain credence if the rejection at $8,000 is followed by a drop below $7,500. In that case, a deeper slide to levels below $7,000 could be seen.

42382082,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qaTj,1560247239,Messaging Giant Telegram's ICO Token Is at Last Going on (Limited) Public Sale,"Messaging app giant Telegram's gram token, previously sold to accredited investors in one of the biggest-ever ICOs, is at last to be offered to the public.  As reported by TechCrunch, a limited sale of the gram token will take place on the Liquid exchangehttps://www.liquid.com/gram/ from July 10. The cost of the token and the targeted total for the raise are not being disclosed as yet.  The sale is being made via Gram Asia, which TechCrunch says is a Korean entity claiming to be the largest holder of gram token.  Grams have previously been sold only to accredited investors in Telegram's massive two-phase ICO in February and March of 2018 – a sale that brought in around $1.7 billion.  The funds were to be used to develop the Telegram Open Network (TON), an ambitious blockchain meant to decentralize multiple facets of digital communication, ranging from file sharing to browsing to transactions.  According to the gram sale page on Liquid's website, ""TON brings speed and scalability to a multi-blockchain architecture that addresses the need for minimal transaction times and airtight security.""  It also states that the sale is open to all investors globally, but excludes some nations including the U.S. and its territories and Japan, most likely due to fears that the token could be considered a security in those jurisdictions.  As reported by CoinDesk previously, whether Telegram would eventually hold a public sale at all was in some doubt due to such regulatory risks.  It's also worth noting that any gram tokens sold in the upcoming offering will not be immediately tradeable.  The website says:  ""The tokens being sold will not be released until after TON goes live (mainnet release), in accordance with the delivery schedule. Purchasers will not be able to transfer, withdraw, or trade the Grams before they are released.""  Investors signing up to Liquid for the sale can purchase grams with either U.S. dollars or the USDC stablecoin. A full token launch is expected at the end of October, the website indicates.

42382084,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qaXV,1560242632,Philippines Central Bank Warns on Risks of Growing Cryptocurrency Use,"The chief of the Philippines central bank has warned over the risks of growing cryptocurrency use in the country.  On Monday, The Philippine Star quoted Benjamin Diokno, governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, as saying his institution would continue to address the use of cryptocurrencies, especially given the tech's potential use in the funding of terrorism.  The central bank's deputy governor, Diwa Guinigundo, also spoke of cryptocurrency's limitations as a substitute for fiat money, as a medium of exchange and actual value.  And, while cryptos and blockchain can be useful for settlement, they effectively allow users to sidestep the banking system.  Guinigundo said:  “For this reason, game theory dictates possible dysfunction when there is market breakdown, when everyone may distrust one another. There cannot be a total disregard for a central bank or a third party that provides lender of last resort facility.""  To balance encouraging innovation with risk mitigation, the central bank prefers to use regulatory sandboxes to keep oversight of such new technologies, Guinigundo said.  The central bank execs' warning comes as use of cryptocurrencies in the Philippines continue to rise. The PhilStar previously reported that virtual currency transactions in the Southeast Asian nation almost doubled from $189.18 million in 2017 to $390.37 million last year, based on data compiled by the central bank's Technology Risk and Innovation Supervision Department.  Those transactions in the Philippines include conversions from Philippines pesos and other fiat currencies to cryptocurrencies and vice versa, as well as inbound international remittances facilitated through cryptocurrencies.  In response to the surge in use, the central bank in February 2017 issued a circular mandating cryptocurrency exchanges to register with the central bank as remittance and transfer companies, and further required these firms to set up safeguards to ensure consumer protection and counter illicit transactions such as money laundering and terrorist financing.  The central bank stressed that it does not intend to endorse any cryptocurrency, since it is neither issued or guaranteed by a central bank or backed by a commodity. Nevertheless, the institution said it aims to regulate the tech when used for delivery of financial services, particularly for payments and remittances, to ensure consumer protection and financial stability.  To date, 10 exchanges in the Philippines have been registered with the central bank.

Announced Tuesday, this group of mostly European insurers (none of whom were named) will offer a crime insurance product to institutions using Metaco's SILO solution for so-called hot and cold (online and offline) wallets.  According to Aon, the policies cover losses on everything from natural disasters destroying the private keys kept offline in cold storage to third-party hacks of hot wallets connected to the internet. It did not disclose the dollar amount of coverage available.  This is Aon's latest partnership with a crypto custody player, following tie-ups with San Francisco-based Anchorage and Vo1t, which employs former staffers of the U.K. Ministry of Defence.  Insurance is scarce for crypto held at custodians or exchanges, particularly with hot wallets. However, the insurance industry has gradually responded to demand starting with cover for cold storage, which is similar to storing bullion or cash in a vault.  That demand is indirectly driven by banks and other financial institutions interested in holding digital assets, said Jacqueline Quintal, financial institutions practice leader at Aon Risk Solutions.  “Anyone who is speaking with institutions on the custody side or even from a trading perspective often finds themselves in the middle of a vendor management process that those firms put everybody through, and with that comes insurance requirements,” she said.  Big-name backing  Based in Lausanne, Switzerland, Metaco is part-owned by the telecom provider Swisscom; the national postal service, Swisspost; and banking technology vendor Avaloq. It focuses on providing custody tools to crypto-curious institutions. The Swiss subsidiary of Russian state-owned Gazprombank is a client.  SILO, the firm's hardware security module-based (HSM) platform, involves components from Estonia-based security mavens Guardtime.  Metaco is one of the firms that make up the Custodigit partnership underpinning German securities exchange Deutsche Börse’s digital asset pilot in Switzerland.  Down the line, Metaco expects to work with pure crypto exchanges, said CEO Adrien Treccani, who co-founded the company in 2015 with Nicholas Dorier, a Bitcoin Core contributor.  But making insurance readily available to clients is an important step now.  “We wanted to provide a framework under which any of the custodians relying on SILO would be almost able to get an insurance cover out of the box, at least to have all of the green lights for the technology components of the insured,"" Treccani said.

42382067,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qYQf,1560225643,Fraud-Fighting 'Watchtowers' to Arrive in Next Bitcoin Lightning Release,"So-called lightning network ""watchtowers"" – a much-anticipated next step for securing the network – are coming soon.  Watchtowers have long been considered a missing piece of bitcoin’s lightning layer, as they’re crucial for squashing fraud on the experimental, off-chain network that could make bitcoin payments faster and more scalable. With version 0.7 of the LND software release coming at an undisclosed date in June, Lightning Labs is launching the most complete build of a network watchtower to date.  When someone uses lightning, it's necessary for someone using it to remain online to make sure their ""counterparty"" isn't trying to steal those funds. But this is obviously a UX nightmare; for example, customers don't have to monitor their Wells Fargo accounts every day to ensure that they're not being defrauded.  The watchtower ""watches"" for old ""states"" to be broadcast. In other words, if a bad actor tries to broadcast an old transaction – giving themselves extra money – the watchtower responds by punishing that bad actor.  Thus, watchtowers outsource this anti-fraud functionality so users don't have to do perform this kind of monitoring themselves.  Lightning Labs head of cryptographic engineering Conner Fromknecht has been the driving force behind this implementation, even giving a talk on the design decisions (like how they made decisions to preserve privacy) of the implementations at a virtual lightning conference in April. Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun and others on the team have collaborated with him design decisions over the past year.  As Osuntokun explained to CoinDesk:  ""A big factor also [in my opinion] is that now we have a direct deterrence in place against any possible breach attempts, now that the tower code is out there in the open, an attacker now has a very strong disincentive against attempting an attack since it's very possible that the potential victim has a tower watching their back.""  The concept for watchtowers aren't new, as it was first proposed in the original 2015 lightning network whitepaper as a way to prevent fraud.  Indeed, Lightning Labs has been working on an implementation since at least the beginning of last year, as CoinDesk reported. But what's set to be released is, perhaps, the most-advanced implementation intended for real-world use so far.  Running a 'tower'  Since inception, there have been some technological tests for watchtowers, including MIT's Lit, an open-source project led by lightning white paper co-author Tadge Dryja, and Lightning Peach from blockchain services firm Bitfury.  But with LND's forthcoming release, one notable aspect will be that users will be able to tap the watchtowers to watch real-world participants who are testing lightning today.  Then there's Bitcoin Lightning Wallet, which implements watchtowers in what's known as the ""Olympus Server,"" but Osuntokun argues it doesn't have ""auto discovery.""  The other benefit of LND's watchtowers, Osuntokun notes, is that can be run by anyone.  ""The importance of this release is that once deployed, any routing node can run their own tower to protect their infrastructure, also any business using [lightning network] today can also start to run towers to protect their nodes,"" Osuntokun told CoinDesk.  But not everyone will want to run their own watchtower, especially as they will eat up a lot of data. So people can start connecting to outside towers to protect their money.  As more of these towers crop up, users can connect to as many of the towers as they want to make sure they're not trusting just one tower to make sure their money is safe. That said, this state of affairs might not happen right away.  ""We'll also likely see instances of people running towers in the open for their friends to connect to for themselves,"" Osuntokun added.  Osuntokun expects that the introduction of watchtowers will lead to a ""safer network,"" paving the way for users to be able to make payments on the network that weren't considered safe before. That includes allowing users to put more money into lightning channels via a technology named after Spongebob, he said.  'Ecash' token and beyond  This coming release is a big step for the long-awaited technology, but Osuntokun and the Lightning Labs team still have future plans for improving the watchtower software.  For example, those users set to run watchtowers will be doing so for free. But Lightning Labs is planning an upgrade to allow people to pay small fees to watchtowers so there's ""financial incentive"" to run them as well.  Interestingly, though, there's a bit of a debate going on about the necessity of this approach.  Lightning co-creator Dryja has argued that if lightning works, watchtowers shouldn't actually be used very much. That's because, if the watchtowers work, bad actors shouldn't try to broadcast old channels states because the watchtowers will ensure the bad actor loses money if they try.  And if there are watchtowers at work, such an arrangement should, in theory, serve as a barrier to keep people from trying to commit fraud. Therefore, they'll rarely be used and get paid for it. But it's hard to predict such outcomes until the watchtowers have been deployed and start attracting user attention.  As they're trying to keep watchtowers as privacy-preserving as possible, the team is looking into a way for making these payments to watchtowers more private.  To that end, they're looking into creating a ""sort of ecash token."" Ecash is the anonymous currency created by cryptographer David Chaum in the 1980s, and is considered to be one of the precursors to bitcoin.  The idea is to allow lightning users to pay for watchtowers in a way that isn't ""linkable.""  Then, there's one other big step. Right now, LND is the only main lightning network implementation following the official specifications to have an up-and-running watchtower so far. As such, other implementations will need to implement their own watchtowers as well.

42382035,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qYFL,1560223813,"Fidelity, Tenaya Capital Fund Crypto-Security Firm Fireblocks","Fireblocks, a platform for securing digital assets in transit, announced today $16 million in Series A funding from investment heavyweights including Cyberstarts, Tenaya Capital, and Eight Roads -- the proprietary investment arm of Fidelity International. The additional capital will enable the company to build out its infrastructure, and court additional firms.  Several influential customers likeGalaxy Digital andGenesis Global Trading have already switched to Fireblocks to safeguard the transmission of their digital assets across exchanges, over the counter brokerages, hot wallets, and cold storage.  Spurred to action following a series of high-profile hacks, founders Michael Shaulov and Pavel Berengoltz aimed to eliminate the root cause of digital asset hacks and scams, i.e. private key theft, spoofing, and compromised credentials.  Shaulov told CoinDesk, he and his colleague from Lacoon Mobile Security -- which was acquired by Check Point in April 2015 -- “reprioritized” their target clients from “traditional financial infrastructure to crypto,” following the “clearly sophisticated hacking by true professionals, including nation states.”  What they built -- along security engineers from Symantec, Trusteer, IBM security and leading cryptography advisor, Prof. Ran Canetti -- was a cloud-based security platform that eliminates the hassle of copy and pasting addresses and enables the seamless flow of funds.  “While Blockchain based assets by themselves are cryptographically secure, moving digital assets is a nightmare. After interviewing over 100 institutional customers, including hedge funds, broker-dealers, exchanges, and banks, we concluded that the current process is slow and highly susceptible to cyber attacks and human errors,” Shaulov said in a statement.  Fireblocks enables digital assets to be easily transitioned from any state of storage and primed for immediate settlement and transfer on the blockchain using chip-level security and MPC technology. The platform also allows the use of several layers of security including passwords, biometrics, and two-factor identification, which have become industry standard.  What sets Fireblocks apart, however, is the level of programmable control available to client accounts. The platform allows for tranches of authorization and access among those using the service to control the flow -- in terms of timing and amount -- of transactions. This allows financial institutions that have different types of employees, from traders to operations managers, all with access to digital funds, to set different permissions for different scenarios.  At issue was a matter of speed as much as security. Shaulov said, “New uses of blockchain cannot rely on gaps in service. [Investors] need assets to be available, interactable, and transferable.”  “There was a need to take assets, either native to the blockchain or tokenized assets or securities, and move, trade, sell them in a reasonably fast time frame,” Shaulov said. “Keeping assets locked down in cold storage like a traditional custodian is antithetical in the way [investment firms dealing in crypto] operate.”  Fireblocks released its product last quarter and has already overseen hundreds of millions of dollars worth of digital asset transfers, according to Shaulov. “The technology itself can be used for any financial use case of blockchain.”  The company is integrated with 15 digital asset exchanges and offers support for over 180 cryptocurrencies, tokens, and stablecoins. Shaulov added that he’d like to build the infrastructure used by small and large merchants as they adoption of digital assets as a payment method becomes widespread.

42382060,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qYMt,1560221436,Study: 75% of EOS Dapp Transactions Are Now Made By Bots,"AnChain.AI, an AI-powered blockchain ecosystem security company, released a report showing that the equivalent of $6 million in transaction volume was driven by rampant, malicious bot activity on Dapps in the first quarter of 2019.  The report -- the largest-scale study of malicious bots in the EOS ecosystem -- also found 51 percent of unique accounts and 75 percent of total transactions were driven by non-human accounts. Bot activity threatens the integrity of the blockchain industry, as user activity, transaction volume, and daily volume are among the most frequently called-upon metrics for determining technological validity, and precisely what is being faked, said Victor Fang, CEO of AnChain.  AnChain is backed by Amino Capital, a Palo Alto VC firm, and has 15 employees.  The study examined millions of transactions from the top 10 EOS blockchain gambling Dapp platforms -- which represent 65% of all EOS Dapp transaction volume -- to monitor performance and detect suspicious activity. Using artificial intelligence, AnChain was able to root out repetitive or hyperactive accounts to determine that they were malicious bots.  Fang suggest that these autonomous players were programmed to boost Dapp ranking, increase liquidity of Dapp utility tokens, reap unearned profits on Dapp payout dividends, sabotage competitors by congesting the Dapp, or launch targeted attacks on vulnerable Dapps.  In particular, during the study AnChain identified five Ethereum addresses behind an extremely sophisticated attack that employed 50,000 self-destructible malicious bots to steal $4 million over two weeks, by exploiting a contract flaw in a popular gambling game.  The study goes on to suggest that bot activity is a feature, not a bug, of decentralized blockchains. Pseudonymous transactions “leave the door open to bots going undetected for extended periods of time,” in comparison to IP based internet accounts that are governed by a central authority, like ICANN or the SEC. ""The decentralized nature makes blockchains even harder to defend than cloud systems,"" said Fang.  Though Fang also admits, ""In the long run, blockchains will be more secure."" However because of the way cryptography has been implemented, there is currently no way to ensure organic growth. Although AnChain only examined EOS, his findings coincide with a report compiled by the SEC, which found that “95 percent of reported Bitcoin volume is fake.”  This is not to say the bots are only an issue for blockchains. The report cites a study showing that almost 40% of all Internet traffic in 2018 alone was bot driven. In fact, Fang drew an allusion to the early days of the internet, when it seemed like only gambling and porn sites could thrive. Ultimately, he suggests, blockchains need more accountability -- be it from a centralized authority or decentralized action.  ""This is the first time a company used deep learning to X-ray all the leading transactions and ask how healthy is this ecosystem,"" said Fang. ""People will have to realize it's a problem and take actions against it.""  The study found that the most active Dapp, EOS, representing $480 million in weekly transaction volume, has only a small percentage of bot activity. It’s the lagging Dapps that account for substantial amount of suspicious transactions. In fact, the second most popular Dapp exhibited the most bots, at around 1,900 out of the platforms 4,500 unique users. The authors suggest, “This dynamic hints at the competitive nature of the Dapp world where the runner-ups are leveraging bots in order to augment overall ecosystem usage metrics.”  The authors also note that the second most popular Dapp has roughly four times the amount of transactions on its platform -- signaling, but not arriving at popularity. These falsified numbers skew datasets, fooling investors, regulators, builders, operators, and enthusiasts in the process.  Fang said untrustworthy platforms will have long-term negative consequences for an industry that is still developing. The company suggests, in order to preserve legitimate competition, and draw earnest adoption, developers should institute automated quality assurance tests on their platforms, and discourage cheating through the implementation of malicious bots.  Ironically, much of this protocol can be transparently initiated through the use of “good bots,” which can automate screening and enforcement of regulations.  What’s more, on slower Dapps, good bots could be programmed to interact with human players, who may not always find other gamers to play with… “a bot player will be deployed to fill the void.”  Image via Shutterstock.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/11/study-75-of-eos-dapp-transactions-are-now-made-by-bots,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16df0ebdd96774708fcdce490b8b20ca035503ef-1762x872.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
