7469190,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515865,1673565640,“Parabolic” Signal That Triggered Past Bitcoin Bull Runs Reappears,"Bitcoin price made a 5% move today, poking above $19,000 momentarily. It is currently the largest daily climb of 2023 and since the FTX collapse. More significantly, the sharp rally tagged a level that triggered a possible trend change according to the weekly Parabolic SAR. In the past, the technical indicator has lived up to its name. What could it mean this time? Bitcoin Makes Biggest Move Of 2023 The start of 2023 has been positive for altcoins. But up until today, Bitcoin has been mild by comparison. Following today’s CPI data release coming in at 6.5% and Biden’s victory lap on inflation, Bitcoin price soared by $1,000, taking the top cryptocurrency above $19,000 briefly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: What Elliott Wave Theory Suggests Is Next For BTC More importantly than what happened today, was what occurred on the weekly timeframe. BTCUSDT (Binance) weekly tagged the Parabolic SAR for the first time since May 2022. The LUNA collapse pulled Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies lower, beginning the second, more aggressive phase of the recent downtrend. The same Parabolic SAR signal was also triggered prior to the 2019 crypto rally, and the 2020 to 2021 bull run (pictured below). Both rallies also blossomed from the same exact trend line previously. The Parabolic SAR has produced profitable results | BTCUSDT on TradingView.com BTCUSDT Weekly Triggers Parabolic SAR Buy Signal The Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator designed by J. Wells Wilder, Jr. and is used to detect changes in trend direction. The tool consists of a visual overlay of SAR dots that hover above or below price action, determining the direction of the trend. When the SAR dots are tagged, it suggests that a trend might “stop and reverse” — which is precisely what SAR stands for. Therefore, it’s especially effective in timing entire and exits. Because the SAR dots travel higher or lower alongside the trend, they can be used reliably to set trailing stop losses. Related Reading: Currency Expert Explains Why Altcoins Experience More Carnage Than Bitcoin And Ethereum On weekly timeframes, BTCUSDT (Binance) touched the Parabolic SAR, essentially telling short traders to get out of the position. If bears had used the PSAR for trailing stop losses, they’ve now been stopped out — purposely — in profit. While the signal isn’t a guarantee of continued upside, considering that the possible signal of a trend change has appeared alongside the coincidental timing of a long-term trend line touch, the recovery from this level could be more sustainable than many are ready for.

The lawsuit alleged that the unregistered offer and sale of securities took hold through Gemini Earn, a high-yield crypto lending product that both Genesis and Gemini started offering in Feb. 2021. Genesis loaned Gemini users' crypto and directed some of the profits back to Gemini, which acted as an agent to facilitate the transactions and hence deducted an agent fee sometimes as high as 4.29%, the regulator said. The remaining returns were then returned to users. The program was not registered as a securities offering when it clearly should have, as Genesis ""exercised its discretion in how to use investors’ crypto assets to generate revenue and pay interest to Gemini Earn investors,"" it added. “As a result, investors lacked material information about the Gemini Earn program that would have been relevant to their investment decisions.” The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement and civil penalties. “Today’s charges build on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler.

As of Thursday afternoon, MAYC, a 19,439-edition extension of the Bored Ape NFT ecosystem, was in the top spot on OpenSea, recording a 13% bump in trading volume over the last 24 hours. The floor price of the collection stands at around 17.5 ETH, or about $25,000 – a more affordable entry point for those looking to join the Bored Ape ecosystem.  BAYC, the 10,000 edition flagship collection, saw a 237% boost in trading volume over the last 24 hours, according to OpenSea, with its floor price hovering around 78 ETH ($111,000). BAKC, a companion collection for BAYC holders, also saw a 46% boost in trading volume in the past 24 hours. Its floor price stands at 9.1 ETH (about $13,000) as of Thursday afternoon.  The pump comes a day after parent company Yuga Labs announced that it would soon offer a “Sewer Pass” NFT mint that could be claimed for free by existing holders of BAYC or MAYC NFTs. Holders of a BAKC NFT can also pair their pet with a BAYC or MAYC NFT, which allows them to mint “a higher-tiered Sewer Pass,” according to Yuga Labs.  Each Sewer Pass grants access to a game called Dookey Dash, which instructs holders to reach a score above 0 to validate their Sewer Passes and ""transform them into a mysterious power source."" What this means remains unclear, though NFTs created from this month-long experiment will be part of a bigger narrative experience called ""Chapter 1"" at a later date, according to the project's roadmap.

The software upgrade, which has been a topic of discussion across the Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) community since December 2022, seeks to address spikes in gas fees as well as chain reorganizations, abbreviated as reorgs. If approved by the community, the upgrade will take hold on Jan. 17. A so-called gas fee is a tax that all users must pay in order to transact on the blockchain. Gas prices typically increase when there is outsized activity on the chain, thus the proposed hard fork aims to reduce the intensity of gas fee spikes. For reorgs the developers want to reduce the amount of time it takes to finalize a block to verify transactions successfully, as reorgs make it tough to properly verify successful transactions as a longer blockchain gets created due to the deletion of a previous block from the blockchain. In essence, that change would result in fewer reorgs, The Block noted. Specifically, the goal is to reduce Polygon's sprint length to 16 blocks from 64 blocks, allowing validator nodes to better reconcile what the correct chain is, as more blocks would be produced in a shorter period of time. MATIC tokens took part in the risk-on day, rising 4.5% to $0.90 at the time of writing, as the broader crypto market extended its rally after softer CPI data.",NEUTRAL,ETH | MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MATIC | FORKS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3924344-polygon-developers-seek-january-hard-fork-to-address-gas-fee-spikes-chain-reorgs?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7467479.jpeg

This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  He denied stealing funds and claimed FTX and sister company Alameda Research collapsed because of the crypto market meltdown and inadequate hedging on Alameda’s part.  “I didn’t steal funds, and I certainly didn’t stash billions away,” Bankman-Fried wrote. Later in the post he concluded that “Alameda lost money due to a market crash it was not adequately hedged for.”  While alleging the trading firm ""failed to sufficiently hedge its market exposure,"" he also said he ""hasn't run Alameda for the last few years.""  Bankman-Fried faces numerous federal charges including conspiracy to commit fraud, and is now free on bail at his parents’ home in California. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, but his lieutenant and Alameda chief Caroline Ellison pleaded guilty to fraud charges and is now cooperating with an investigation with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.  While casting the blame of FTX's downfall on Alameda's poor hedging, Bankman-Fried notably didn't address the $65 billion line of credit he opened from the exchange to the trading arm, as revealed in a court hearing on Wednesday. At the hearing, a lawyer representing FTX in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings said the credit line has led to a ""shortfall in value"" in repaying customers and creditors.  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market value briefly topped $19,000 Thursday – rising 8% for the day and reaching its highest level since the FTX-crash-induced market sharp downturn in early November. Crypto-related stocks even made larger gains as the rally in the sector continued. BTC slid earlier in the day after the latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed that inflation slowed down last month before experiencing a quick surge in the afternoon trading hours (ET). It had settled back to $18,800 as of publication time.  Equities closed higher Thursday following the positive inflation data: Both the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) were up 0.6%, while the S&P 500 was up 0.3%.  Ether (ETH): The second-largest cryptocurrency recently followed BTC’s direction, rising 6% for the day to trade around $1,427 as of press time. As Ethereum’s upcoming Shanghai upgrade approaches in spring, data from Etherscan shows that more than 16 million ETH have been deposited into Ethereum’s Beacon Chain staking contract as of Thursday, representing over $22 billion at current prices.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: Inflation Cools, but Hopes for Fed Pivot Might Be Too Hot  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Bitcoin and ether responded positively to the release of December inflation data, with prices fluctuating as the day progressed.  BTC’s hourly chart shows a sharp uptick in trading volume during the hour of the announcement. Most telling in that hour of trading is the momentary decline in prices, implying that some traders viewed the inflation data as an opportunity to take profits. ETH’s hourly chart shows almost identical price behavior, with a slight increase upon release of the report, followed by a price decline in the following hour.  Probabilities that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by 25 basis points in February rose to 96% from 77% a day prior. Verbally this could be categorized as a shift from highly likely … to really, highly likely. Traders are reducing their bets on a more aggressive hike of 50 basis points.  But the federal funds futures curve implies that interest rates will increase to near 5% before pivoting lower in the second or third quarter of 2023. This remains largely unchanged – a sign that while the Fed might slow the pace of hikes, it will stay in hiking mode for quite a while.  Read the full technical take here.

The investment regulator took aim at Gemini Earn, the troubled yield-bearing product that hundreds of thousands of U.S. investors entrusted with their crypto. Gemini generated yield on billions of dollars in crypto by loaning deposits to Genesis, which loaned them out again.  But Genesis’ November closing of lending withdrawals left some 340,000 Gemini Earn customers and about $900 million in crypto in limbo, the SEC said. (Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk). The regulator accused the popular program of being an unregistered security.  “Defendants offered and sold the Gemini Earn Agreements through the Gemini Earn Program without registering” with securities regulators, the complaint said. “As a result, investors lacked material information about the Gemini Earn program that would have been relevant to their investment decisions.”  The lawsuit is the latest twist in a high-stakes CEO battle pitting the Winklevoss twins of Gemini against Barry Silbert, head of DCG. The Winklevoss twins, shaken by the fall of their popular yield product, have accused Silbert of fraud in his company’s management of Genesis; Silbert calls the brothers' accusations a publicity stunt.  The lawsuit is a ""manufactured parking ticket,"" said Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, responding in a Twitter thread.

Over the last 24 hours, DOT increased by more than 6%. In the past week, the coin has secured double-digit gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Climbs 5% To Take Out Hurdles, Is Bottom Really In? Bitcoin moved into its daily chart’s $18,000 price zone, pushing altcoins on their respective charts. Although DOT rallied in the last 24 hours, the altcoin is still not out of the woods. The altcoin must remain above two price levels. The technical outlook still sided with the bulls, but there was a fall in the accumulation on the daily chart, indicating that there has been a fall in demand. The demand, however, secured by DOT reached a multi-month high. Usually, after being overvalued, the coin starts to retrace on its chart. Indicators showed that if buyers do not remain consistent, DOT will depreciate on its chart over the subsequent few trading sessions. The altcoin market capitalization fell slightly in the last 24 hours, which meant demand for the altcoin dipped. At the moment, DOT was trading 90% below its all-time high of 2021. Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOT was trading at $5.09 at the time of writing. The coin was trading within an ascending parallel channel (blue). The ascending parallel channel marked a bullish force in the market. At the time of writing, Polkadot broke above the ascending parallel channel, indicating that DOT might consolidate over the subsequent trading sessions before it starts to retrace. Immediate resistance for the coin stood at $5.30; if it managed to breach that level, it could rally to $5.40. On the other hand, if Polkadot loses its momentum, it will fall to $4.80. The altcoin has to remain above the $4.80 mark, or the bears will take over completely. Technical Analysis The altcoin was still in the bullish zone despite a slight fall in demand. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was above the 60 mark with a minor downtick; this indicated that although demand fell, the price was under bullish control. Similarly, the asset price was seen above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), which indicated that the bulls were driving the price momentum in the market. As RSI secured a multi-month high, the altcoin traveled above the 50-SMA (yellow) line. With increased demand, technical indicators pointed out traders could have a buying opportunity. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence suggests price momentum and reversals. Related Reading: Avalanche Impresses With 32% Rally – Will AVAX Sustain This Ascent?

42413109,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7tPk,1673557622,Polygon’s Blockchain to Undergo Hard Fork,"Ethereum scaling project Polygon has announced a proposed hard fork to its proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain.  If approved, the software upgrade is set to take place on Jan. 17, and will address gas spikes and chain reorganization (reorgs).  The hard fork discussion was first introduced to the Polygon community in December 2022  What's in the hard fork?  The first change in Polygon’s new fork involves an adjustment to how it sets gas fees – a kind of tax one pays out to a blockchain in order to transact on it. With the fork, Polygon aims to reduce the spikes in gas prices that tend to occur when there is a lot of activity on the chain.  “Although gas will still increase during peak demand, it will be more in line with the way Ethereum gas dynamics work now,” Polygon said in a statement shared with CoinDesk. “The goal is to smooth out spikes and ensure a more seamless experience when interacting with the chain.”  The second proposed change addresses reorgs, which can occur when a validator node – one of the computers operating the Polygon blockchain – receives information that temporarily creates a new version of the blockchain. Such an event makes it difficult to properly verify if a transaction has been successful, since nodes will need to reconcile which chain is the correct one (otherwise known as the “canonical” one).  To address its problem of relatively frequent reorgs, Polygon wants to reduce the amount of time it takes to finalize a block to verify successful transactions. The plan is for Polygon’s “sprint length” to be reduced from 64 to 16 blocks, meaning that a block producer can produce blocks for a much shorter time period, from (128 seconds to 32 seconds).

42393874,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brb1Ix,1673556176,"Crypto Markets Analysis: Inflation Cools, but Hopes for Fed Pivot Might Be Too Hot","The bitcoin (BTC) market is suddenly at its hottest in two months, after a five-day winning streak that has pushed the cryptocurrency’s price toward levels – breaching $19,000 on Thursday – where it traded prior to the epic market collapse that followed the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange.  Crypto traders may want to exercise caution: The latest U.S. inflation reading suggests that Federal Reserve monetary tightening – among the biggest broad-market factors that put downward pressure on BTC last year – may still have a long way to go.  The consumer price index data for December shows inflation rose 6.5% from 12 months earlier, in line with expectations and down from a pace of 7.1% in November.  This marks the sixth consecutive month of declines in the inflation rate, and with it the sixth consecutive month of renewed hopes for a Fed pivot to lowering interest rates. The data suggests that little will change in the Fed’s approach.  While the overall inflation rate fell, much of the decline was concentrated within the energy sector. Energy services declined 17% month over month, while gasoline prices fell 9.4% over the same time period.  Prices for food, apparel and shelter were up 0.3%, 0.5%, and 0.8%, respectively, month over month and 10%, 2.9%, and 7.5% annually.  Bitcoin and ether (ETH) responded positively on the release of the data, with prices fluctuating as the day progressed.  BTC’s hourly chart shows a sharp uptick in trading volume during the hour of the announcement. Most telling in that hour of trading is the momentary decline in prices, implying that some traders viewed the inflation data as an opportunity to take profits.  ETH’s hourly chart shows almost identical price behavior, with a slight increase upon release of the report, followed by a price decline in the following hour.  BTC and ETH are up 5.5% and 2.8% overall on the day.  Probabilities that the Fed will raise interest rates by 25 basis points in February rose to 96% from 77% a day prior. Verbally this could be categorized as a shift from highly likely … to really, highly likely. Traders are reducing their bets on a more aggressive hike of 50 basis points.  But the federal funds futures curve implies that interest rates will increase to near 5% before pivoting lower in the second or third quarter of 2023. This remains largely unchanged – a sign that while the Fed might slow the pace of hikes, it will stay in hiking mode for quite a while.  Finally, while much of Thursday’s discussion has revolved around inflation, initial jobless claims for the week ending Jan. 7 fell below expectations. Lest we forget Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remark during a press conference after the central bank's last meeting that the jobs market “remains extremely tight.”  ""Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions,"" Powell said at the Dec. 14 meeting.  Today’s data, while positive, shows that price increases are indeed cooling – but have further to cool. Expectations that the Federal Reserve will change its course of action – and pivot anytime soon toward softer monetary policy – should probably cool as well.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/12/crypto-markets-analysis-inflation-cools-but-hopes-for-fed-pivot-might-be-too-hot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1975056734d2f2d0a94b9d9dd1117feb052f731f-4000x6000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""Here's a very young individual who was interested in crypto but is also interested in things like inoculations and vaccines and seems to have about 190 [in] IQ, something that's not necessarily common inside the Beltway.""  Plus, FTX “had become a household name” thanks to its Super Bowl ads and sports sponsorships, he said.  When companies such as Lightspeed and Temasek invest in a company like FTX, ""there's sort of a presumption, and I think it's a dangerous presumption, that this is a real company ... instead of this sort of Ponzi scheme,"" Himes added.  What should the new Congress do next? Hymes said the primary focus should be on stablecoins.  With “tens of billions of dollars of stablecoins trading every day,” it may be the “best place” for lawmakers to implement a regulatory framework, he said.  “I think that can get done in Congress,” Himes said, noting that ""we almost got it done in the last Congress."" He would also like to see legislation mandating the registration of crypto exchanges.  One thing is for certain, according to Himes: The U.S. needs to “get its act together” and come up with “smart regulation.” He said the best-case scenario is for the U.S. to work ""in harmony"" with regulators in Europe and Asia on crypto the same way they do on traditional finance.

As Bankman-Fried tells it on Substack, FTX users can have the stake in trading app Robinhood – worth about $450 million, though now seized by the U.S. Department of Justice – that he bought. A nice gesture, surely, as their money remains locked up.  But the swashbuckling hero’s tale is darker in court. In a Jan. 5 document filed with the Delaware bankruptcy court, Bankman-Fried resisted an attempt to transfer the 56 million Robinhood Markets (HOOD) shares to the estate of FTX – arguing both that he needed the funds to pay for his criminal defense and that FTX couldn’t prove he'd acquired the stock fraudulently.  The shares were acquired via a series of loans he and colleague Gary Wang had received from FTX’s trading arm, Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried’s filing said.  That’s legitimate, Bankman-Fried argued; the Substack post said he “didn’t steal funds.” Alameda’s ex-CEO Caroline Ellison has, however, pleaded guilty to charges including commodities fraud, which includes the allegation that she misappropriated FTX customer funds to satisfy Alameda’s souring loans.  Contacted by CoinDesk, a spokesperson for Bankman-Fried declined to comment on when and how he offered to cede the Robinhood securities (as he claimed to do in the Substack post).",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/12/sam-bankman-fried-blogs-like-a-robin-hood-but-in-court-hes-not-so-charitable,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f110d304f5abc0fbbf4a17c2f7dbbb75d35e063-1620x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Helped in part by December's slowdown in consumer price inflation, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) climbed 7.5% to $18.86K at 2:55 p.m. ET, reaching the highest mark since Nov. 8 (three days before FTX filed for Chapter 11 protection). Similarly, ether ( ETH-USD ) perked up 6.1% to $1.42K. The gains across major tokens pushed up the global crypto market cap by 5.1% to $905.3B, though still down significantly from the roughly $3T November 2021 peak, according to CoinMarketCap data . Other cryptos deep in the green include: cardano ( ADA-USD ) +4.8% , polygon ( MATIC-USD ) +5.5% , solana ( SOL-USD ) +4.3% , polkadot ( DOT-USD ) +4.7% and shiba inu ( SHIB-USD ) +6.5% . The continued cooling in CPI data, the latest of which showed headline inflation of 6.5% Y/Y in December fell from the 7.1% rise in November, fueled speculation that the Federal Reserve will keep downshifting its interest-rate increases this year. Markets are largely expecting the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee to lift the benchmark rate by the standard quarter-point increment at the Jan. 31-Feb. 1 meeting. Crypto-related stocks clocked in even bigger gains.

After more than two years following the snapshot for XRP holders, the project finally conducted its airdrop for the FLR token on Monday, January 9. As NewsBTC reported, the FLR token already experienced a massive dump of more than 71% on Bitrue in the run-up to the airdrop, where the token could already be traded as IOU. After that, things didn’t get much better and FLR dropped even further, totaling a loss of 93% since Sunday, January 8. At press time, FLR was trading at $0.0437. Thus, the FLR price is in no man’s land. The IOU on the token debuted back in January 2021 at Bitrue and started at a price of $0.0831. After that, the FLR token went up to $2.2472. At no point did FLR trade below its January 2021 debut price. FLR price since January 2021 | Source: FLRUSDT on TradingView.com Ripple CTO Raises Harsh Allegations Against Flare Team Via Twitter, Ripple’s chief technology officer wrote that the current rules for holding Flare for subsequent airdrops provide absolutely no incentive not to sell Flare now. “You lose *nothing* if you sell now,” Schwartz said. He added that while it’s true that XRP holders miss out on subsequent airdrops, you don’t lose them. As the Ripple CTO explained, you can get 100% of their value if you sell your Flare, as the buyer can wrap the token and get the airdrops. Related Reading: Ripple (XRP) Related Flare Network Token Airdrop: FLR dumps by 71% In general, Schwartz considers the distribution of the airdrop “a very strange decision.” For a long time, the project advertised that XRP holders would receive the full amount of FLR tokens right away. However, the team did not keep its promise. They declared that with the first airdrop, only 15% of the total amount of 1.0073 FLR will be distributed for each XRP. The remaining 85% of FLR tokens will be airdropped in 36 monthly installments, with the method of distribution still dependent on a community vote. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Bulls Could Aim $0.4 or Higher Schwartz sees this as a breach of their commitment. “I want to be wrong, but I don’t see how,” the Ripple CTO said, following up with another serious allegation: I feel bad saying this. I love the project and want the best for it and want to believe the best about it. But my honest opinion is that they leveraged the XRP community to grow and weakened their promises drastically when they felt they didn’t need it anymore. While Schwartz qualified his statement in the following tweet when he wrote that this doesn’t mean they are “dishonest or that their project is bad,” he also said that XRP has evolved while the Flare Network team “failed to deliver on some promises” from the early days. You can love Flare and love XRP too. It’s not one or the other. But I don’t have happy fuzzy feelings about how it went down. Schwartz Advises To Sell The FLR Token (Later) In response to a user’s follow-up question about whether it is now the best time to “take profits,” Schwartz replied: I’m not saying people should sell. I’m just saying that they are acting irrationally if they don’t sell because they want the value of the remaining 85% of the airdrop. That’s just not rational. Another user countered the argument by saying that FLR is already “worthless” after the massive crash, so owners of the token should rather wait. The Ripple CTO agreed, citing that “now is probably the worst time to sell. It would be kind of silly not to wait that out.” Featured image from Forbes, Chart from TradingView.com",NEGATIVE,XRP | FLR,ICO | TRADING | XRP | FLR | AIRDROP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/ripple/ripple-cto-advises-selling-flr-tokens/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Bitcoin is now up about 14% this year after falling 63% in 2022.  Meanwhile, shares of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) were up 4% in recent trading. They have risen 35% year to date. The moves in the stocks of bitcoin miners are even more dramatic: Marathon Digital (MARA) is up 16% Thursday and 83% year to date, and rivals Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Hut 8 Mining (HUT) have notched similar gains.  Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) – whose discount to net asset value (NAV) widened to nearly 50% toward the end of 2022 – is up 12% for the session, and has now narrowed its discount to NAV to 36.4%. Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) – a software company that has more than 130,000 bitcoins in its reserves – were up 5.5% Thursday and have jumped 42% this year. Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also CoinDesk's parent company.  The Consumer Price Index rose 6.5% in December from a year earlier, inline with expectations and down from a 7.1% increase in November.

Steven Lubka, managing director of Swan Bitcoin's private client department, said he expects inflation to continue to soften in the first half of 2023, which should give the Fed room to throttle back on its monetary-tightening policy.

42411263,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMZwM,1673543878,Remembering Hal Finney on the 14th Anniversary of the First Bitcoin Transaction,"It’s been 14 years since the first bitcoin transaction was sent. On Jan. 12, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the Bitcoin system, sent Hal Finney, a well-regarded cryptographer and computer scientist, 10 bitcoin (BTC). This test transaction, sent before BTC had a quotable price, was a harbinger of the many peer-to-peer transfers to come enabled by the world’s first cryptocurrency network.  Finney, who died in August 2014, was also the first person besides Satoshi to download and run Bitcoin’s software. He detailed his story in a 2013 BitcoinTalk forum post, where he said he was the first person Phil Zimmerman, another legendary cypherpunk, hired for the PGP Corporation to build the Pretty Good Privacy encryption solution.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away,” Finney wrote. He was primed to find interest in a project that separates money from politics and enables user-sovereignty over their wealth, having experimented with earlier instantiations of “digital cash.” Others, Finney claimed, were initially more skeptical.  “Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee-jerk reaction,” Finney wrote. So he mined a few coins, found a few bugs and let the software run for a few days before determining the protocol was stable but draining on his computer’s CPU, and so switched it off.  In August 2009, a few months after he was the first to download, receive and walk away from bitcoin, Finney was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease (or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) – a debilitating illness that attacks a person’s nervous system. ALS left him paralyzed within the span of a few years.  He eventually found his way back to Bitcoin, to which he contributed after his illness forced him into an early retirement. At the time he was writing out his recollections, Finney was building a new type of wallet. “It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals,” he said.  Bitcoin was a project he could see growing very quickly. In a received email to Nakamoto, Finney was one of the first to put a price on the cryptocurrency. Estimating a fraction of total global household wealth would spill into the project, each of the 21 million coins could one day be worth $10 million.  “Since we're all rich with bitcoins, or we will be once they're worth a million dollars like everyone expects, we ought to put some of this unearned wealth to good use,"" he wrote in a separate 2011 Bitcoin Talk post. If it sounds lofty, Finney was aware of the speculative side of cryptoeconomics.  ""The danger is if people are buying bitcoins in the expectation that the price will go up, and the resulting increased demand is what is driving the price up. That is the definition of a BUBBLE, and as we all know, bubbles burst,"" he wrote. His other economic predictions – like the nature between the network's growth and security – have more or less been born out.  Finney is commonly suspected to have invented Bitcoin. Beyond the fact that coders are often their own first users and business-founders their own first customers, Finney certainly had the chops to design something like Bitcoin, which combined several pre-existing cryptographic and computational ideas in a novel way.  See also: The Genesis Block: The First Bitcoin Block  For instance, Finney created the first reusable proof-of-work system in 2004, building on the original proof-of-work algorithm designed by Adam Back (another Satoshi contender), allowing people to redirect computational energy towards a useful purpose. Finney's use case for RPoW was a digital token system.  If Satoshi’s “true” identity didn’t matter then, it hardly matters now. Finney wrote that in his correspondence with Satoshi he thought he was dealing with a “very smart and sincere” person – a quality he learned to recognize over the years. But what mattered most was that the code ran, and the idea was sound.

42413132,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7vwu,1673542800,Crypto Market Maker CyberX Gets $15M From Foresight Ventures,"Crypto market maker CyberX has raised $15 million in a strategic investment from Foresight Ventures, a crypto venture capital firm with about $400 million in assets under management.  CyberX will use the funds to expand its teams in Asia and North America, add more integrations with exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and build out its trading infrastructure. Decentralized finance refers to financial transactions carried out on a blockchain without the use of traditional middlemen.  Market makers are essentially trading firms utilizing their own capital to bet on tokens and take the other side of trades on exchanges when other traders are trying to buy in or out quickly. The collapse of multibillion-dollar crypto exchange FTX raised questions about the general liquidity of the industry, and market makers came under the spotlight.  CyberX’s liquidity solutions include algorithmic market making in spot and derivatives markets, futures options, structured products, over-the-counter services and DeFi protocols.  ""Blockchain technology has transformed the way value is exchanged in [traditional finance]. As a crypto market maker, we aim to connect assets efficiently and transparently with our proprietary technology to provide liquidity across trading venues, DeFi protocols, and [non-fungible token] marketplaces,"" said CyberX CEO Hao Wang in a statement.  CyberX was founded in 2016 by a group of Wall Street veterans and now has offices in the U.S., Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore. The CyberX liquidity network has grown its daily trading volume to $400 million, which includes more than 30 venues and 5,000 tokens.  The firm said its trading volume has increased nearly 10 times in the past year, with DeFi represented around 40% of its trading activities.

According to data from NFT marketplace OpenSea, the same wallet that sold the original NFTs is minting tokens that serve as access passes to the sweepstakes prizes touted during the launch of the Trump Digital Trading Card collection in December.  The tokens feature images of Trump holding a sign resembling a ticket, listing the prizes promoted during the original mint. These include a group Zoom call, a gala dinner and a hardcover copy of his book “Our Journey Together.”  The collection now has a trading volume of 35 ETH, or about $48,500, and a floor price of 0.021 ETH, or nearly $30.

TRON’s TVL has reached $9.2 billion by end of 2022, TRON DAO disclosed. Related Reading: Avalanche Impresses With 32% Rally – Will AVAX Sustain This Ascent? TRON chief executive to extend help to FTX and SBF TRX price spikes by 1.52% TRX remains robust in terms of trades A lot of people are now keeping an eye on TRON, and wondering whether it can hold on to its ranking and recuperate especially following its recent sharp decline. The network has always championed its quest for further decentralization. In fact, in comparison to other crypto assets, TRX has made significant progress over a short span of time. Image: TRON DAO TRX Price In The Green, Up 11% In Last Week According to CoinMarketCap, TRX’s price has increased by 11% in the last seven days, and trading at $0.05744 as of writing. Noticeably, many investors are worried about their crypto investments, especially with the crypto crash that happened just recently. Image: CoinMarketCap TRON CEO, Justin Sun, disclosed that he would extend some help to both FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried so the crypto exchange can recover. This recent statement by Sun is quite controversial and has put the network on a bad light. More so, this caused investors to hesitate with the crypto especially as it shows support for the disgraced crypto company. Meanwhile, TRX is said to lead the crypto space in terms of trustworthiness, being an open network. The year 2022 is said to be the token’s best year so far with its price shooting to as much as 2,950%, an all-time high. In fact, even in the face of an ongoing bear market, TRON remains to be as robust as ever in terms of trades with investors generously funding the network. FUD Surrounding TRON Still Felt Recent price activity in TRON (TRX) has been influenced by Bitcoin (BTC) and the activity of the US stock market. On the 11th of January, speculators wagered on reduced U.S. inflation, which boosted cryptocurrency markets and led to a rally on U.S. stock markets. At the time of publication, the fear, uncertainty and doubt surrounding TRON’s founder Sun and the Huobi exchange can still be felt, which contributed to the negative weighted sentiment regarding TRX. TRX total market cap at $5.2 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: Polkadot Records New Achievements In Dev’t Activity, Pushes DOT Price Up This demonstrates that the investor had a pessimistic view of the asset going into the transaction. However, this was not enough to stop TRX from surging. At this point, TRON’s revenue has shown to spike from $509,942 to $637,526 as seen in the previous month. The increase in revenue is said to be triggered by the padding of the number of active wallet addresses on the network which also shows an increase in users by 4.53%.

He denied stealing funds and claimed FTX and sister company Alameda Research collapsed because of the crypto market meltdown and inadequate hedging on Alameda’s part.  “I didn’t steal funds, and I certainly didn’t stash billions away,” Bankman-Fried wrote. Later in the post, he concluded that “Alameda lost money due to a market crash it was not adequately hedged for.”  While alleging the trading firm ""failed to sufficiently hedge its market exposure,"" he also said he ""hasn't run Alameda for the last few years.""  Bankman-Fried faces numerous federal charges including conspiracy to commit fraud and is now free on bail at his parents’ home in California. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, but his lieutenant and Alameda chief Caroline Ellison pleaded guilty to fraud charges and is now cooperating with an investigation in the Southern District of New York.  While casting the blame of FTX's downfall on Alameda's poor hedging, Bankman-Fried notably didn't address the $65 billion line of credit he opened from the exchange to the trading arm, as revealed in a court hearing on Wednesday. At the hearing, a lawyer representing FTX in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings said the credit line has led to a ""shortfall in value"" in repaying customers and creditors.  In three instances in his note, Bankman-Fried called an announcement by crypto exchange Binance to withdraw funds from Alameda in early November that set off a run on the FTX exchange a ""targeted attack.""  ""The November crash was a targeted attack on assets held by Alameda, not a broad market move ... As a result, the larger hedge that Alameda had finally put on that summer didn’t end up helping. It would have for every previous crash that year – but not for this one,"" Bankman-Fried wrote. ""Over the course of November 7th and 8th, things went from stressful but mostly under control to clearly insolvent.""  He insisted that FTX's U.S. arm remains solvent and can be used to repay customers. He also said he plans to use nearly all his personal assets to help customers who lost money and says he has ""offered to contribute nearly all"" of his personal Robinhood Markets (HOOD) shares to customers.  Meanwhile, court filings show Bankman-Fried seeking to retain control of the roughly 56 million Robinhood shares (worth around $450 million) to pay his legal fees. The disputed shares have since been seized by the Justice Department.

Ready Player Me allows users to create and transport avatars across various metaverse platforms, including Spatial and Somnium Space. In its partnership with Unstoppable, users can create avatars using Ready Player Me and use them as their profile pictures (PFP).  The streamlined process allows users to connect to an existing Ready Player Me account or upload a photo of themselves to auto-generate an avatar with their likeness.  Users who connect their avatar to their Unstoppable identity will be able to access over 6,000 of Ready Player Me’s applications, games and metaverses, in addition to Unstoppable’s 650 partner apps.  Sandy Carter, senior vice president at Unstoppable Domains, told CoinDesk that integrating Ready Player Me’s avatars into a user’s profile not only bolsters their digital identity but also provides extended access to Web3 technologies.  “Your Unstoppable profile is the center of your digital identity,” said Carter. “With interoperable flows like this, you can envision your avatar becoming the center of your visual identity across all of your favorite metaverses.”  Ready Player Me is also enthusiastic about the partnership’s ability to bring identity to their avatars.  “Thanks to the collaboration with Unstoppable, our users can now claim their Web3 domain and expand their digital identity beyond metaverse platforms,” Timmu Toke, co-founder and CEO of Ready Player Me, told CoinDesk. “They will be able to take advantage of all of the features offered by Unstoppable Domains, creating a single place for presenting their virtual identity.”  In the past year, Unstoppable has expanded its suite of products geared toward making Web3 identities accessible and interoperable. In August, the firm launched a mobile application to streamline access to wallets, dapps and metaverses. In December, the company introduced Etherescan and Polyscan, allowing users to search for Unstoppable Domains addresses on the blockchain data explorers.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/12/unstoppable-domains-and-ready-player-me-team-up-to-create-interoperable-metaverse-identities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a09f5944a8afc80ac8af63f5783b724931daf5e6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42413142,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7w2W,1673532000,Tribeca Film Festival Will Sell VIP Passes as NFTs,"With the use cases for non-fungible tokens (NFT) continuing to expand, New York's Tribeca Film Festival is hopping on the trend by offering VIP passes as digital collectibles.  The VIP passes mark the annual film festival’s expansion into NFTs. They were developed in partnership with crypto exchange OKX. Minted on Ethereum, they will provide perks including special access to film screenings and invitations to exclusive events with the festival’s co-founders, Jane Rosenthal and Robert De Niro.  The NFTs cost $899 and are available for purchase directly through the Tribeca website using a credit card. More experienced NFT collectors can also pay for the passes in ether (ETH) through the OKX NFT marketplace. The design of the NFT artwork was inspired by the landscapes of Lower Manhattan, where this year’s festival will take place on June 7-18.  Nate Zou, head of Web3 products at OKX, told CoinDesk that the Seychelles-based exchange is excited to leverage blockchain technologies to reach new audiences and bring the event into Web3.  “[The Tribeca audience] is perfectly spread across all different demographics – from elder people to younger generations, across all kinds of work,” said Zou. “I think they’re a perfect sample for us to educate the general public about this technology.”  The VIP passes are part of a broader partnership with OKX, which signed on as the festival’s top sponsor last year.  It’s not the first time a major cultural event has commingled with crypto companies. Last year’s Grammy Awards were sponsored by crypto exchange Binance and music NFT marketplace OneOf.  Zou is optimistic that other events will incorporate NFTs as a part of their ticketing strategy.  “I think [the Tribeca festival] can be a great sample for us to try out with our partners in the future,” said Zou. “Whoever is interested can bring the new technology to their existing customer base and see what kind of spark it has.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | BNB,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/12/tribeca-film-festival-will-sell-vip-passes-as-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/30df50d91bfd938a852e37fa977ebe4ed0037032-1600x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411274,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMaTQ,1673531100,Two Advisor Credentialing Organizations Have Their Say on Crypto,"After federal regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Labor as well as Finra, the largest independent industry regulator, perhaps no one speaks louder on advisor best practices and compliance than the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards (CFP Board) and the Chartered Financial Analyst Institute (CFA Institute).  Each has recently made major announcements regarding cryptocurrency investing and advice.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  The CFP Board issued guidelines in November in a “Notice to CFP Professionals Regarding Financial Advice About Cryptocurrency-Related Assets,” which will govern how holders of the CFP certification should handle working with clients on digital asset investing and planning.  In the CFA Institute’s case, it comes in the form of “Cryptoassets: Beyond the Hype,” a report oriented towards investment professionals and financial analysts, which was released this week.  CFP Board  In its report, the CFP Board chose to neither mandate nor forbid its designation holders from recommending cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related assets or providing financial advice about those investments.  The Board will apply the same standards to cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related assets that it applies to all assets; however, it also recognizes that these assets may present heightened risks to clients and have some unique attributes.  “CFP Board’s guidance for a CFP professional to act with caution when providing Financial Advice about cryptocurrency-related assets rests upon the guidance that regulators have issued concerning these assets,” the organization wrote. “Various federal and state regulators, self-regulatory organizations like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), and consumer protection organizations representing or advocating for investors, workers, and retirees have cautioned that investments in cryptocurrency-related assets present significant risks that warrant careful evaluation.”  Thus, according to the CFP Board, fiduciaries should exercise “extreme care” before including a crypto option to a workplace retirement plan such as a 401(k).  Read more: The CFP Board’s Latest Report on Crypto Sets High Standards for Advisors  In any advice setting, including financial planning, CFPs are required to comply with the duty of care, duty of competence, duty to comply with the law and the duty to provide clients information about costs, as well as duties when selecting, recommending and using technology.  Essentially, the guidelines mean that for a CFP to provide advice on digital assets they need to be educated on those assets, their risks and how they might fit into a client’s broader financial picture. Furthermore, the CFP must be able to monitor those investments and recommend technology and custody options with an understanding of those commensurate risks as well.  Furthermore, CFPs are required to at least have knowledge of held-away digital assets and the impact those assets may have on a client’s overall financial picture. CFPs should understand how those assets may impact the client’s “goals, liquidity, cash-flow, taxes and estate plans.”  “A CFP professional also must consider how cryptocurrency-related assets may require special considerations with respect to estate planning, such as a plan for the transfer of a private key if the Client passes away,” wrote the Board. “These are only some of the ways that an investment in cryptocurrency-related assets may affect the Financial Planning recommendations.”  CFA Institute  According to the CFA Institute, three issues need to be resolved before crypto assets can be fully embraced by mainstream investors: valuation, fiduciary duty and the custody of assets.  “To puncture the hype, investors must think through what is actual, what is potential and what is merely aspirational,” said Stephen Deane, senior director, capital markets policy at the CFA Institute, in a statement. “They should also distinguish between the underlying distributed ledger technology, which could well prove disruptive, and the business prospects for the thousands of individual crypto assets on the market today and more to come. We at CFA Institute firmly believe that there are no shortcuts to sound investing.”  Read more: There’s Still Investment Opportunity After the Fall of FTX  The Institute’s researchers then give six loose guidelines for fiduciaries and institutional investors:  Proper analysis remains necessary for fiduciaries to comply with their duties of prudence, loyalty and care.  With the inclusion of crypto, principles of portfolio construction still apply and investors should continue to take a holistic and strategic view towards portfolio construction.  Fiduciaries are expected to analyze the value, volatility, correlation effects, momentum and/or technical features of any proposed investment.  Intrinsic value of digital assets should be related to an in-depth, rational analysis of specific use cases.  Investing in digital assets and related businesses requires a careful analysis of business model and client acquisition model.  Fiduciaries need to ascertain the custody chain and safekeeping of client assets.  “The debacle at [crypto exchange] FTX shows the harm that can come to investors and platform participants when client assets are not kept safe,” said Olivier Fines, head of EMEA advocacy at the CFA Institute in a statement. “The example of FTX further underlines the importance of custody issues and the responsibility of investors to base their decisions on the investment case and not on hype and speculation.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/12/two-advisor-credentialing-organizations-have-their-say-on-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c705146475cbde5a253fb4899c504b3393641a9-5500x3667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin broke above $18,000, and ether rose over $1,400. Other coins like XRP and solana rose as much as 20%. The liquidations are in addition to those of more than $150 million earlier this week. Such levels haven’t been seen since October, data from Coinglass shows. Some analysts, however, believe the rally exemplifies indecisiveness among crypto traders, as BTC and ETH are trading with a consolidation pattern, according to QCP Capital. Consolidation refers to an asset oscillating between a well-defined pattern of trading levels, marking uncertainty in which direction it will break.  Blockchain.com is cutting around 110 jobs, amounting to about 28% of its workforce. The crypto brokerage previously let go about 150 people last July, after it took a hit of $270 million on a loan it had made to collapsed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. The layoffs at Blockchain.com add to those at other crypto firms, most recently at incubator ConsenSys and exchange Coinbase (COIN). CoinDesk estimates that more than 28,000 jobs have been lost in the crypto industry since last April.  With a loan from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX last year, BlockFi executives’ equity holdings were wiped out by $800 million.In exchange, they granted themselves pay rises of as much as $500,000 each. Founder Zac Prince saw $413 million in equity value eliminated, and was compensated by a salary hike of between $250,000 and $400,000. BlockFi’s lawyers have been keen to stress that there was no last-minute withdrawals prior to the collapse. BlockFi, a crypto lender, has also filed for bankruptcy.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin rallied to a four-week high of $18,370 early Thursday, amounting to a 9% rally since the U.S. jobs report on Jan. 6 showed wage growth slowed in December.  The U.S. Dollar Index has traded weak since Friday, hitting its lowest level since June.  The classic risk-on action may indicate a market positioned for a softer-than-expected Consumer Price Index. Therefore, profit-taking in bitcoin is possible after the inflation numbers are released.  The consensus is for the data to show the year-over-year rate of headline CPI gains dropped to 6.6% in December from November's 7.1%. The core figure excludes the volatile food and energy component and is forecast to have dropped from 6.0% to 5.7%.  – Omkar Godbole     Trending Posts  FTX Has Recovered 'Over $5B' in Assets, Bankruptcy Attorney Says  CFTC Calls for Default Judgement Against Ooki DAO in Ongoing Lawsuit  Why Blockchains Are as Important as ERP for the Future of Companies",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Jamie Crawley, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/12/first-mover-americas-cme-btc-futures-signal-worst-of-ftx-induced-panic-may-be-over,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9335ae02dfeeba83b59d1a9ef483d851ad70ff43-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7486693,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515895,1673527984,"Ethereum Spurts 13% In The Past Week, Investors Hopeful Of Market Bottom","At its current price of $1,408, investors and traders are hopeful that the market bottom is finally here for Ethereum. Analysts are observing that Ethereum is at its key resistance level, poised for a breakout as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data was released Thursday. This rally by Ether – which is up 13% in the last seven days, based on data by Coingecko – has been fueled by a renewed investor sentiment. However, these huge gains are still threatened by macroeconomic forces. The Consumer Price Index reported by the U.S. Labor Department on Thursday showed an annual increase in consumer prices of 6.5%, down from 7.1% in November and the 40-year high of 9.1% in June. Is The Market Bottom Here For Ethereum? Most analysts agree that the market bottom for Ethereum may just be around the corner. But the community is divided on where the price of ETH would go. Some don’t buy the idea that this rally is the start of the crypto market recovery. Twitter user EMoneyMoves sums up the pessimists’ side in his own viewpoint. His most recent thread details his reasons why he doesn’t believe this is the end of the bear market. The gist of it is that this market movement is currently mirroring the 2018 crash of Ether. Related Reading: Avalanche Impresses With 32% Rally – Will AVAX Sustain This Ascent? This itself is not evidence that the market bottom is in. External market forces, according to analysts, will mold the market bottom. “Do not ape now. This might be a bear market rally to mirror the early $ETH bear market rally of 2018. The economy looks like s*it. Record consumer debt. Sky high inflation. Rising interest rates. War in Ukraine choking oil supply. Mass layoffs in major industries starting,” eMoneyMoves said in part of his thread. Indeed, the macroeconomic situation is not looking so rosy. With the World Bank saying that we’re on the brink of a recession, the CPI data means a great deal for investors in the short- and mid-term. On ETH Resistance & Fed Monetary Policies With economies in a bigger slump, this rally might only be a slight relief that precedes more pain. As of writing, the S&P 500 is up 4% in the weekly, nearly gaining as much as Ethereum in the same timeframe. This correlation between the two could set the crypto and stock market tumbling if the CPI data showed a worsening or stagnating situation. As of writing, Ethereum is being rejected at $1,418 which might indicate that the bulls have lost or are yet to lose momentum. This rejection can be further amplified if macros don’t support the sentiment or price action.

The Bulgarian Prosecutor's Office is conducting an investigation in Sofia to ""neutralize the criminal activity"" of Nexo, according to an automated translation of a statement issued on Facebook Thursday. More than 300 people are involved in the operation.  ""The main organizers of the scheme are Bulgarian citizens, and the activity was carried out mainly from the territory of Bulgaria,"" Attorney General Siika Mileva said in the statement. ""Evidence has been collected that a person who used the platform and transferred cryptocurrencies has been officially declared a terrorist financing person,"" according to the statement.  In a thread on Twitter, Nexo said it is cooperating with relevant authorities and regulators. It said it had stringent anti-money-laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) policies and implied it was being targeted unfairly.  ""There are authorities at one of Nexo’s offices in Bulgaria, which is, as you know, the most corrupt country in the EU (European Union),"" a Nexo spokesperson said in an email to CoinDesk. ""They are making AML and tax-related inquiries about a Bulgarian entity of the group that is not customer facing, but only has back office functions – payroll, customer support, compliance. We are one of the most stringent entities with regards to KYC/AML.""  Following news of the investigation, more than $3 million left the company's platform. The lender's native coin sank around 7% to as low as 70 cents. At the time of writing, it was priced at just under 73 cents.  Read more: Why Do Crypto Lenders Keep Blowing Up?

In fact, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was bid up overnight to its highest level in nearly a month, climbing over 4% to regain the $18,000 level. Some other notable developments are also hitting the sector following a court hearing on Wednesday for the collapsed crypto exchange FTX. The latest: Bankruptcy attorneys sifting through the rubble left behind by founder Sam Bankman-Fried apparently have found more than $5B in liquid assets, like cash and tradeable crypto, that may be sold to help repay creditors. It's not yet clear where the money came from, and the figure doesn't include another $425M in crypto held by the Securities Commission of The Bahamas. New FTX CEO, John Ray, has previously said that at least $8B of customer assets were unaccounted for in the worst case of corporate failure he had ever seen. While FTX has already put some units up for sale since entering Chapter 11, such as LedgerX, Embed Financial Technologies, and FTX Europe and Japan, the selling of the newly discovered stash of crypto could dent prices. ""If you try to sell $1B worth of crypto all at once, it's going to depress the market,"" noted Eric Snyder, partner and bankruptcy attorney at Wilk Auslander. The other side: ""We've had many negative events transpire over the past year, and if one looks at the price reaction to those events, in general it's been declining less and less,"" said Vijay Ayyar of crypto exchange Luno. It's an ""indication that the market is accepting the news quite well, sell pressure is being absorbed, and hence we’re moving to an accumulation stage. This could also mean that the market thinks the worst is over for crypto and that most negative news is now priced in.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3924065-bitcoin-regains-18000-as-ftx-recovers-5b-in-liquid-assets?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7443694.jpeg

The amount added to the more than $150 million in shorts liquidated earlier this week as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) broke above key resistance levels, and major tokens like XRP and solana (SOL) rose as much as 20%. Similar levels of liquidation on short trades haven't been seen since October, data from Coinglass shows.  Ether-tracked futures experienced $110 million in both short and long liquidations, the most among all major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin futures saw $77 million in liquidations, while avalanche (AVAX) and gala (GALA) each saw $4.5 million in losses after volatile trading on Wednesday.  Crypto exchange OKX took the lion’s share of these liquidations at over $128 million, followed by Binance at $42 million. Overall, the price surge saw crypto's total market capitalization increase by 3.5% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows.  Bitcoin rallied above $18,000 on Thursday after pushing the threshold for the 10th time in 12 days on Wednesday. Ether rose 4.5% to over $1,400 in the past 24 hours, while cardano (ADA) added as much as 5% before retreating.  QCP Capital sees a strong breakout above $18,000 for bitcoin as a key indicator of recovery, with the next level after that at $28,000.  “Despite the mini-rally, BTC is still trading in an extremely tight falling wedge – with $18,000 the key breakout level to the top side,” the fund said in a Telegram broadcast last week. “ETH continues looking decidedly more bullish than BTC, although it too is still trading within a consolidation pattern.""

42413149,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7wBs,1673518257,"Ether Hits 2-Month High Ahead of US CPI, Market Breadth Remains Weak","Ethereum's native token, ether (ETH), rallied to a two-month high on Thursday, shrugging off the cautious tone in U.S. stock futures.  The second-largest cryptocurrency rose nearly 1% to $1,415, its highest price since Nov. 8, taking the month-to-date gain to over 17%, CoinDesk data shows. According to observers, Ethereum's impending Shanghai upgrade has been driving the price of ether higher. Market leader bitcoin (BTC) topped $18,000, reaching a four-week high.  S&P 500 futures traded flat to negative as investors turned cautious ahead of the U.S. Consumer Price Index scheduled for release at 13:30 UTC.  ""The macro headwinds are becoming macro tailwinds – the U.S. dollar has peaked and the U.S. inflation is dropping fast. The market has moved on from the negative liquidity impact of the hawkish Federal Reserve and bankruptcy news flow of crypto exchanges and liquidity providers,"" Markus Thielen, head of strategy and research at crypto-services provider Matrixport, said.  ""That's why micro is now driving crypto again and why the Shanghai upgrade is lifting prices,"" Thielen added.  Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade, due in March, will de-risk staking by enabling withdrawals of the ether staked or locked into the Beacon Chain since December 2020. The upgrade is expected to boost demand for staking, which would cause a reduction in the circulating supply of ether. Markets appear to be pricing that in advance.  ""It will motivate many ETH holders to stake their ETH as only 14% of the ETH is being staked now, compared to 58% for other layer 1 protocols. Hence, another $20 billion of ETH can be easily staked. More ETH staked means less ETH available to sell when negative news hits the market. Hence, this is bullish,"" Thielen noted.  Noelle Acheson, author of the popular ""Crypto Is Macro Now"" newsletter, said in Monday's edition of the market update, ""The additional flexibility could entice more users to the network, possibly delivering a net positive gain.""  At press time, more than 16 million ETH worth $22.8 billion was locked into Ethereum’s Beacon Chain staking contract, data from Etherscan shows. The tally has increased by 2.6% since Ethereum developers announced the Shanghai upgrade on Dec. 8.  The path of least resistance for ether is on the higher side, the cryptocurrency's breakout from a triangular consolidation pattern suggests.  U.S. inflation numbers, however, could slow the ascent.  ""For now, the ether market appears to be in equilibrium near $1,400. If the U.S. CPI comes in softer than expected, there is a good chance the price will continue to rally toward $1,600,"" Griffin Ardern, volatility trader from crypto asset-management firm Blofin, told CoinDesk. ""But if it beats estimates, there is a possibility of a pullback.""  Analysts on average expect the Labor Department to show that the CPI rose 6.6% year-over-year in December, compared with a 7.1% increase in November. The core figure, which excludes the volatile food and energy component, is forecast to have dropped from 6.% to 5.7%.  Market breadth remains weak  The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has increased by 12% to nearly $500 billion this month. The bullish revival, however, has been led by a select few coins, including ETH.  That's the message from the market breadth indicator, which measures the number of major cryptocurrencies trading above their 200-day simple moving average (SMA).  The breadth indicator is widely used in traditional markets to assess the degree of participation in a rally and broader market momentum. The market is said to be bullish when the breadth is above 50%. Major coins are ones with at least a $1 billion market valuation. (Smaller coins are prone to manipulation and hence excluded from the study).  At press time, there were 40 cryptocurrencies with a market cap of at least $1 billion.  Of those, 13 – ETH, APE, ATOM, BNB, DOGE, LDO, LTC, MATIC, OKB, QNT, TON, XMR and XRP – traded above their 200-day SMA, while the rest, including market leader bitcoin, remained in bearish territory under the key average, according to data sourced from TradingView.  In other words, most major coins traded below the key average, indicating weak breadth or degree of participation in the recent bullish turnaround.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/12/ether-hits-two-month-high-ahead-of-us-cpi-market-breadth-remains-weak,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4fdf004bb69c300799da3f93bd161be733766c4f-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413145,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7w88,1673517005,"FTX Loan Wiped Out $800M in BlockFi Executives’ Equity, Court Filing Reveals","Executives from bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi granted themselves pay rises of as much as $275,000 each, after they saw $800 million in their equity holdings wiped out because of a loan from collapsed crypto exchange FTX, a court filing shows.  A statement of financial affairs for BlockFi, which was filed Thursday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey, contains thousands of pages of transactions that took place in the run-up to BlockFi's collapse. The firm had gross revenue of over $4 million for 2022 until its bankruptcy filing in November.  Last June, FTX offered BlockFi a $400 million loan, and Thursday's filing details the impact of the loan on 13 of BlockFi’s top executives.  “The massive impact of the FTX transaction on management equity led BlockFi’s board of directors to, among other things, increase base salaries and make retention payments for those that remained in the interest of retaining business critical knowledge and capabilities,” the filing stated.  Founder and CEO Zac Prince, for example, saw $413 million in equity value eliminated, and was compensated by a salary increase from $250,000 to $400,000, while Chief Operating Officer Flori Marquez saw a raise from $225,000 to $500,000, the filing said.  BlockFi lawyers have been at pains to stress that – unlike other crypto bankruptcy cases such as the one for lender Celsius Network – there were no last-minute panicky withdrawals by BlockFi senior executives before its collapse.  No member of the BlockFi management team withdrew any cryptocurrency from the platform after Oct. 14, the filing said, and the management team represented just 0.15% of the $7.7 billion in retail withdrawals over the year.  But the filings nonetheless reveal significant withdrawals made by senior management – including over $9 million taken out of the platform by Prince in April, which the filing said was to pay U.S. federal and state taxes, and his withdrawal of just over $870,000 in August.  Most transaction data is anonymized, with the court due to consider next week whether to unseal creditor information. In a parallel hearing Wednesday, a Delaware judge agreed FTX customer names can remain secret for three months.

The funding round was led by Castle Island Ventures and 1kx and included contributions from other digital asset heavyweights including Circle Ventures, Coinbase Ventures and Dragonfly Capital Partners.  Alkimiya provides a protocol for miners and staking validators to lock in upfront revenue to fund future production. This is designed to manage the risks of fluctuating cash flow, exacerbated further when liquidity is scant across decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Its aim is to provide a source of cash flow that is independent of the overall liquidity across DeFi ecosystems.  The protocol derives its revenue from allowing depositors to gain a portion of rewards generated from mining and staking activities from block space producers – referring to entities that utilize massive computing resources to participate in mining or staking to earn rewards.  These cash flows represent the native economic activities accrued on the block space. However, the miners and validators are burdened with increasing expenses. Without effective tools to manage the risks, they are fully exposed to market risks such as the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies.  “A fundamental issue with DeFi today is the lack of support from natural cash flow. It’s currently a system of highly self-referential and interdependent machines that are addicted to cheap sources of liquidity and when the environment changes, the entire DeFi space dries up very quickly,"" Alkimiya co-founder Leo Zhang said.  ""Alkimiya aims to bridge this gap with block producers' hedging needs. This strategic funding round will help to further our expansion and deepen our relationships with key partners,"" Zhang added.  Among Alkimiya's products is Silica, which represents a swap between the upfront payment that the buyer agrees to purchase the contract with and the mining rewards produced by the amount of hash power specified during the contract period.  Alkimiya is aiming to fully launch on the Ethereum mainnet during this quarter, following a beta launch on Avalanche in the second quarter of 2022.

42413150,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7wAw,1673507619,Staked ETH Passes 16M,"Almost four months after Ethereum’s successful shift to a proof-of-stake network, the second-biggest blockchain has passed another major milestone. More than 16 million ether (ETH) have been deposited into Ethereum’s Beacon Chain staking contract, data from Etherscan shows.  The 16 million ETH figure constitutes more than 13.28% of the total ether supply and represents nearly $22.38 billion at current prices. It comes nearly two years after Ethereum’s staking contract went live in 2020, when the network’s proof-of-stake Beacon Chain was introduced.  Validators – people who help run the Ethereum network – “stake” ETH for a chance to write and authenticate transactions to the blockchain’s ledger. The staked funds get locked up with the network and accrue interest, but they will be impossible to withdraw until the network’s Shanghai upgrade, which is not expected until March.  While the growing number of staked ETH can be interpreted as a promising sign for Ethereum security and adoption, it may ramp up pressure on the network’s core developers to expedite work to enable withdrawals.  Data from Nansen indicates the number of unique staking depositors stands at roughly 92,500. Data sourced from BeaconScan shows that the number of active validators is about 498,000.  A larger amount of staked ETH should theoretically make it more difficult for an individual actor to sabotage the Ethereum chain. However, the bulk of Ethereum’s stake currently belongs to a handful of large actors – fueling concern that control over the chain is becoming too centralized.  Out of the 16 million ETH staked, roughly 4.65 million have been staked through Lido – a kind of community-driven validator collective. Lido, Coinbase, Kraken and Binance, the four largest Ethereum validators, command a 55.88% share of all staked ETH, according to Nansen.  The amount of staked ETH has climbed about 16.68% since the Merge in September, when Ethereum abandoned its old proof-of-work consensus mechanism. The Merge fully transitioned the Ethereum blockchain to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which abandoned proof-of-work’s energy-intensive crypto mining process in favor of today’s staking system.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Sage D.

The CFTC, which sued Ooki DAO last year on charges of running an unregistered crypto futures trading facility and failing to conduct proper know-your-customer checks, argued in a filing Wednesday that the date for the DAO to respond – Jan. 10, 2023 – had come and gone, and said the court should enter a default judgment against the group.  ""On December 20, 2022, the Court deemed service on the Ooki DAO of the Complaint and Summons in this action complete as of that date,"" the filing said. ""Pursuant to Rule 12(a)(1)(A)(i), the Ooki DAO’s answer or other responsive pleading to the Complaint was due on or before January 10, 2023. ... The Ooki DAO failed to answer or otherwise defend as instructed by the Summons and as provided by the Rules.""  Ooki DAO, a successor to a company called bZeroX, allegedly allowed U.S. persons to trade illicit crypto derivatives products. The CFTC settled charges with bZeroX and its founders, Tom Bean and Kyle Kistner, in September and attempted to sue the entire DAO at the same time. The lawsuit was served by way of a chat bot and a forum message.  Read more: CFTC’s Ooki DAO Action Shatters Illusion of Regulator-Proof Protocol  Various groups of attorneys and companies in the crypto industry pushed back, arguing that a DAO cannot be treated like a person and the CFTC should have to identify the token holders behind Ooki DAO rather than serve the DAO as a whole.  While Judge William Orrick, of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, initially said the CFTC should try and serve at least one token holder, he said in a Dec. 20 ruling that serving Bean and Kistner – who were still, apparently, token holders – met this requirement, despite the previous CFTC settlement and a statement from their attorney saying they had no role in the DAO.  ""In this case, requiring the CFTC to serve some individual known Token Holders even after the DAO received actual notice is a belt-and-suspenders procedure to ensure that the due process requirements are met,"" Orrick wrote. ""... The CFTC has utilized all of the information reasonably at its disposal to serve Ooki DAO, and it is clear that Ooki DAO has actual notice. Service was proper and complied with due process requirements.""  The judge also pointed to ""national media coverage"" and the fact there were four friend-of-the-court briefs as evidence that, most likely, Ooki DAO as an entity is aware of the lawsuit against it.

According to CoinMarketCap data, most huge gains were made by altcoins in the past 30 days. AVAX, native token of the Avalanche blockchain, is one of them with gains of up to 32% in the seven days. The rally came as major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum all registered gains and increased investor sentiment. Although the fear, uncertainty, and doubt of the last year’s bear market is still present, the increasing chance of a recession still gives investors some worry. As of writing, AVAX is trading at $15.96, up 28% in the last 24 hours, data from Coingecko show. What Supported The Avalanche Rally? The Avalanche ecosystem has been bullish. Recently, Shopify partnered with Avalanche to allow Shopify merchants to sell their NFTs. According to public information, users don’t need to handle any cryptocurrencies to buy NFTs. Venly, one of the numerous blockchain partners of Shopify, created a no-code tool for sellers to create NFTs. In a recent interview, Venly co-founder Tom Dierckxens said that this evolution in NFT technology is an evolution which can be adopted in the mass market. This is only the most previous on-chain development for the ecosystem.

On-chain developments also led to Avalanche experiencing a strong uptick in development activity and price as seen on data provided by Santiment.

42413148,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7w94,1673495472,First Mover Asia: The Next Avraham Eisenberg Isn’t Going to Be a ChatGPT-Powered ‘Script Kiddie’,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin broke through the $18K threshold for the first time since mid-December, in a mostly green Wednesday.  Insights: The Next Avraham Eisenberg Isn’t Going to Be a ChatGPT ‘Script Kiddie’  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 908 +36.3 ▲ 4.2% Bitcoin (BTC) $18,213 +806.5 ▲ 4.6% Ethereum (ETH) $1,401 +71.2 ▲ 5.3% S&P 500  3,969.61 +50.4 ▲ 1.3% Gold  $1,886 +11.0 ▲ 0.6% Nikkei 225  26,446.00 +270.4 ▲ 1.0% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin pushes toward $18K  By Bradley Keoun  Just days after bitcoin (BTC) crossed the $17,000 price threshold for the first time in weeks, the largest cryptocurrency by market value has now breached the wall of $18K.  The question now is whether the rally can last; bitcoin has gained in 10 of the past 12 days. CoinDesk markets analyst Glenn Williams Jr. took a look at blockchain data for clues on the outlook.  As of press time, BTC was changing hands around $18,213, up 4.6% over the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was up 4.2%.  The U.S. government's latest release of the the most widely tracked inflation figures, the consumer price index (CPI), is due out Thursday, covering price increases in December. The question is whether the report will show a significant enough decline in inflation to warrant a slowdown in monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve.  ""Holders of risk assets such as crypto are hoping for a soft CPI print to signal inflation easing,"" the analysis firm FundStrat wrote Wednesday in a note to clients.  According to Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya, many institutional investors remain cautious despite this week's rally.  ""If risk appetite remains intact post-inflation report, bitcoin could make another run at the $18,500 level,"" Moya predicted Wednesday. ""If core prices prove to be troubling, bitcoin could decline back towards the December lows.""  Insights  DeFi is Too Complex for ChatGPT  By Sam Reynolds  A few days ago, Ars Technica covered an interesting and novel use case of AI chatbot ChatGPT, which in its few months of existence has been used for everything from plagiarism to making high-end business intelligence analytics more accessible.  The kids are now making hacking tools.  It’s a return of the script kiddies.  Back in the mid-1990s, well before the days of the dark web, corporate America feared hackers. The nation’s economy had rapidly become computerized, but despite the incredible increases in efficiency this brought, IT security was still fairly unsophisticated at the time.  From this era came a few fabled names, such as Kevin Mitnick, who broke into the networks of commercial giants including Apple and Motorola while eluding the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for years; to the hacker groups Legion of Doom and Masters of Deception, which battled each other with grander and grander hacks in a game of one-upmanship (now-Decrypt CEO Josh Quittner documented this for Wired in 1994 and later wrote a book on it).  But in the shadow of these groups were another class of hackers called “script kiddies.” Usually teenagers or young adults, they didn’t have the know-how to create exploits from scratch. Instead, they lurked on the hacker forums frequented by these notable names and used the exploits they developed to cause chaos.  As Ars Technica documents, thanks to ChatGPT's ability to create code the possibility for low to moderately-skilled hackers to get an edge is enormous. Everything from producing bots for information stealing to building entirely new darknet markets for illicit trading is now possible for the layman.  But what does this mean for DeFi?  The future of finance sure is defined as having shoddy security. According to DeFi Yield’s REKT Database, over $50 billion was lost during the last year to decentralized finance (DeFi) exploits.  Now, these aren’t all hacks. Some of them were exploits. In the case of Mango Markets, for instance, Avraham Eisenberg didn’t break any code (a hack), but created clever scripts to exploit market conditions in his favor.  But the question is, now that the script kiddies have figured out how to make hacking tools with ChatGPT, will they do the same for DeFi?  After all, there’s at least $50 billion for the taking, based on the data.  Not so fast, says Yajin Zhou, CEO of Blockchain Security firm BlockSec. DeFi is such a unique beast that while the ChatGPT might be able to put a “normal” exploit together, DeFi is just too complicated for it.  “It’s not time to panic yet. ChatGPT’s ability to generate a working DeFi exploit is still at an early stage of development. It cannot generate functional exploits for vulnerabilities that involve complicated DeFi semantics,” he told CoinDesk.  George Zhang, head of developer relations at wallet provider UniPass, added that ChatGPT simply isn’t able to write code at the level of precision required yet.  “Smart contract hacks require very precise code to work. I wouldn’t worry about ChatGPT bringing DeFi security Armageddon,” Zhang wrote to CoinDesk in an email. “It is possible for attackers to leverage ChatGPT to generate malicious code, but ChatGPT-generated code would mostly only work for very poorly written smart contracts.”  For the attack to be successful, the smart contract would have to contain very basic, 101-level mistakes, Zhang noted. Testing that his team has done shows the tech is still far from reaching the necessary level of automation to be a threat.  “A considerable amount of proprietary data relating to the smart contract and labeling of potential exploits are necessary for the attack to even have a shot,” he said.  It seems like DeFi exploiter is one job that won’t be immediately disrupted by the AI revolution.
