The exchange filed 19b-4 documents on Wednesday, formally kicking off a review process. Once the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledges the filings, it will start a 240-day clock for a final decision. The SEC will have a number of intermediary deadlines to make a decision, but has traditionally taken the maximum number of days possible to review applications.  Coinbase will act as the surveillance-sharing partner for both products, similar to the role it expects to play with a broad swath of spot bitcoin ETF applications currently working their way through the SEC review process. The crypto exchange will also act as the custodian for the ether held by the Ark 21Shares trust. VanEck did not disclose the name of its custodian.  Should one or both of these applications be approved, it would mark a first for the U.S. At present, there are no spot crypto ETFs, though traditional financial luminaries like BlackRock and Fidelity have recently started bids to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved by securities regulator. Several asset managers have recently filed to launch ether futures ETFs as well.  The SEC has always rejected spot bitcoin ETF applications, but recently suffered a setback after an appeals court ruled that its rejection of a bid by crypto trust overseer Grayscale was ""arbitrary and capricious"" given the existence of bitcoin futures ETFs.  The assets underlying a bitcoin futures ETF have a high degree of correlation with the assets that would underpin a spot bitcoin ETF, the unanimous ruling said.

The rally, however, quickly faded, with bitcoin giving up any session gains and returning to just below $25,700, roughly its level of 24 hours ago. Ether followed the same price action and is also flat at $1,630.  The broader CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is underperforming a bit, lower by 0.3% over the past day.  The economic news remains bearish  Crypto was under pressure Friday morning after the ISM Services Index for August came in at a stronger than expected 54.5. That was up from 52.7 previously and ahead of economist forecasts for 52.5.  The news was further confirmation that the U.S. economy continues to expand, obviating the need for the Federal Reserve to consider easing monetary policy. It sent interest rates higher and the price of bitcoin down below $25,400.  Accounting rules provide a bullish boost  The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) later Friday essentially approved a rule dictating that public and private companies with crypto on their balance sheets use fair-value accounting when reporting holdings.  Companies currently have to mark crypto holdings at the lowest value they hit during a quarter – considered, by some, MicroStrategy's Michale Saylor included, an impediment to corporate adoption.

Bankman-Fried faces a litany of financial crimes related to his crypto exchange’s November 2022 collapse. He had been out on bail until the federal judge overseeing his case revoked his bail in early August for witness tampering, a decision the former FTX CEO appealed.  That appeal will be heard by the next available three-judge panel, the clerk of the court said Wednesday while also denying his request for immediate release. The timeline on next steps was not immediately clear.  Bankman-Fried’s lawyers and the government have fought for weeks now over what the defense claims are subpar conditions in the Metropolitan Detention Center. They claim their client can’t properly prepare for his October trial from jailhouse bars, and therefore needed to be released. That motion is separate from their appeal of Judge Lewis Kaplan’s revocation of Bankman-Fried’s bail.  Judge Lewis Kaplan last week asked both sides to brief him on “the current situation at the MDC” by this past Tuesday. But the government and the defense are at odds over what that situation is; they submitted conflicting letters to the court addressing his ability to access laptops with defense material.

17213268,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550295,1694032258,Analyst: Blackrock’s Bitcoin Spot ETF May Unleash $30 Trillion From US Advisors,"The possibility of a Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) launching in the US, which has gained much attention over the past months, has again made headlines due to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas’s recent suggestions. According to the analyst, should the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approve BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot ETF, a vast pool of $30 trillion capital overseen by US financial advisors could be directed toward Bitcoin investments. Notably, Balchunas clarified that while the approval of a BTC spot ETF could serve as an accessible pathway for the $30 trillion managed by financial advisors to flow into BTC investments potentially, it is not particularly sure if the entirety of the $30 trillion would move into Bitcoin. Related Reading: BREAKING: Grayscale Triumph: SEC Crushed, GBTC Rockets Towards ETF, Bitcoin Targets $28,000 The analyst noted that only a fraction of that amount might consider investing. Balchunas noted: “But even if 0.5% of that allocates, it’s $150b.” Hey I said that a spot ETF will be a bridge to the $30T advisors manage, a very small amt of which may invest, not all 30! 🙂 But even if 0.5% of that allocates it’s $150b — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 5, 2023 Aftermath Of A BlackRock’s Bitcoin Spot ETF It is worth noting that when BlackRock, boasting over $9 trillion in assets under management, lodged its Bitcoin spot ETF application, it didn’t merely mark its entry. It also dramatically tilted the probability scales for an ETF approval. Before BlackRock stepped into the frame, the Bloomberg expert claimed that the odds of a BTC spot ETF seeing the light of day in the US hovered around a mere 1%. However, after BlackRock’s involvement, Balchunas disclosed in a podcast that the probability surged to 50%. Their application had consequences. Balchunas observed a subsequent surge in similar applications from renowned entities, namely ARK Investment, Valkyrie, and Fidelity. This underscored BlackRock’s influence and the escalating competition in the space. Balchunas noted: Their application triggered a wave of similar filings by other prominent firms such as ARK Investment, Valkyrie, and Fidelity, setting the stage for a highly competitive environment. Spot ETF Vs. Futures ETF: The Real Potential The US isn’t entirely unacquainted with BTC ETFs. Bitcoin futures ETFs have already made their mark, albeit in a limited manner. As it stands, these futures-based ETFs amass roughly $1 billion in total assets under management. A figure that, though impressive, may appear minor in the face of a spot ETF’s potential. Balchunas went as far as to term the BTC spot ETF the “holy grail.” A product that, if approved, could overshadow existing futures ETFs and charge up the crypto domain in ways so far unseen.

Then Prove BTC Is Not Manipulated, Says SEC Meanwhile, amid the race to approve a Bitcoin spot ETF, BTC has been in a continuous downtrend over the past week.

17209549,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550296,1694026835,"Make or Break Season? Crypto Analyst Predicts A Fall To $1,200 If Ethereum Stays Beneath This Level","Like most altcoins, Ethereum (ETH) has seen its price succumb to the negative market sentiment in recent weeks. This unfavorable market condition has consistently caused the second-largest cryptocurrency to trade beneath the $1,700 level. Could Ethereum Price Fall To $1,200? In an X post dated Wednesday, September 6, crypto analyst Ali Martinez offered insight on the price of Ethereum. The analyst shared that the value of ETH faces a potential significant correction to $1,200 if it stays below $1,680. Source: IntoTheBlock/ali_charts Using data from the blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, Martinez’s projection revolves around the purchasing areas where most investors acquire ETH. According to the analytics platform, the price zones beneath the range of $1,633 to $1,681 are “weak purchasing areas,” which hint at weak support. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Maze: Will It Soar To $2,000 Or Stay At $1,500 In September? IntoTheBlock data shows few investors bought ETH beneath this level – down to the $1,385 price range. This ultimately implies that the support is thin around those levels – as indicated by the small size of the green circles in the image above. With weaker support at the lower price ranges, the Ethereum price might be unable to stay afloat should bearish pressure increase. This explains why crypto analyst Ali Martinez believes the ETH price beneath $1,680 is a source of concern for traders. Meanwhile, the significant percentage of holders currently at a loss exacerbates this risk. Some ETH investors may choose to sell their assets to cut their losses, which could trigger downward pressure on the cryptocurrency’s price. This Smart Whale Purchased 19,500 ETH – What Do They Know? On a positive note, an Ethereum whale has been purchasing ETH in the past two days, according to the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain. On Tuesday, the 5th of September, the analytics platform revealed that the whale deposited $36 million USDC on Binance and withdrew 9,819 ETH (worth $15.9 million at the time). Subsequently, the whale withdrew 9,689 ETH (worth $15.8 million) from Binance on Wednesday, bringing their total purchase to 19,506 ETH (equivalent to $32 million). Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Send $486 Million To Coinbase, Time To Exit? Typically, when large amounts of cryptocurrencies are moved out of centralized exchanges, it indicates that whales are accumulating – and sometimes anticipating a price rally. Moreover, looking at this particular whale’s past transactions shows that they have the habit of buying Ether at low prices and selling at high prices to make a profit. Hence, this latest transaction suggests that the whale is expecting a bounce. However, it is worth noting that the price of Ethereum has not changed in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the Ether token currently trades at $1,624.35, with a 0.8% price decline in the last 24 hours.

42419657,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFHjB,1694026473,Genesis Global Capital Files for Over $600M in Unpaid DCG Loans: Court Docs,"Genesis Global Capital filed a suit against Digital Currency Group (DCG) and Digital Currency Group International (DCGI), seeking the repayment of multiple loans with a principal amount of over $600 million.  The pair of filings on Thursday allege that DCG borrowed up to $500 million across four different loans from Genesis in 2022, while DCGI borrowed 18,697.7 BTC in 2019. DCG and Genesis entered into master loan agreements on Nov. 10 last year, and each of these 2022 loans had an extended or normal maturity date of May 9 or 10, 2023. DCGI entered into a master loan agreement with Genesis on June 21, 2019, with a similar 2023 extended maturity date. Genesis and DCGI are both subsidiaries of DCG, which is also CoinDesk's parent company.  Genesis, which filed for bankruptcy in January this year, alleged in its Wednesday filings that DCG and DCGI are ""wrongfully in possession of property"" belonging to Genesis Global Capital's bankruptcy estate.  Each of these loans matured and are payable as of this past May, the filings said, but DCG appeared to want to convert the loans into ""Open Loans,"" sending notifications to Genesis on May 9. However, the onetime crypto lender alleges, Genesis did not agree to this conversion, and reserved its rights to be repaid.  ""The May 9 DCG Request for wire instructions for repayment of the Loans at 10:37 p.m. (ET) on May 9, 2023 does not constitute a 'timely' request as contemplated in the MLA,"" the DCG filing said. ""Because Section II(c)(i) of the DCG MLA contemplates that, following DCG’s request for wire instructions, GGC shall provide the wire instructions no later than the day prior to the Maturity Date of a given Loan, the May 9 DCG Request cannot constitute timely notice with respect to the May 9 Loan or the May 10 Loan (given that it was sent on, not before, the Maturity Date for the May 9 Loan, and was sent approximately 90 minutes before midnight on the day prior to the Maturity Date for the May 10 Loan).""  As of Wednesday, DCG owed Genesis $500 million, while DCGI owed 4,550.5 BTC (worth about $117 million as of press time), the two filings said. Genesis is also looking for late fees and accrued interest, saying these funds are ""property that the debtor could use"" in its ongoing bankruptcy case.  In a statement, a DCG spokesperson said, ""Genesis has agreed to stay the turnover action so that we can move forward with documenting the deal in principle that was reached with Genesis, the UCC, and DCG. We are documenting a forbearance agreement and expect to file it with the court shortly. At that point, we will initiate the distribution of funds and continue on the path to significant recovery for Genesis creditors.""

The suggested changes departed from the usual practice of marking these assets for their unrealized losses – seen by the industry as a barrier to wider crypto adoption. Specifically moving crypto into the accounting rules means companies will make gains and losses a part of their quarterly income reports.  “I think we heard overwhelmingly from investors that allocate capital based on the use of financial statements that this will provide them better information to make their decisions, and so I’m fully supportive of it,” said Richard Jones, the board’s chairman.  The board is encouraging companies to seek early adoption of the new standard.  Michael Saylor, the founder and former CEO of MicroStrategy (MSTR), tweeted that this development “eliminates a major impediment to corporate adoption of $BTC as a treasury asset.”  Read More: U.S. Accounting Board Seeks Crypto Standards Requiring Firms to Report Price Shifts",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/06/fasb-says-crypto-assets-should-be-marked-at-current-values,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b8ac79cc8e3d49d263b38064dadbe1651c70165-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF is the first attempt to list such a fund in the U.S. that directly invests in ETH, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  The fund would custody the assets with Coinbase (COIN) Custody Trust Company.  The news initially sent ether and bitcoin higher, but the rally proved short-lived and both cryptos have returned to prices seen ahead of the filing.  The filing follows a slew of applications for a much-coveted spot bitcoin ETF, including a joint attempt from Ark and 21Shares. The SEC last week delayed decision on all of those applications.  The filing also comes ahead of what's expected to be SEC approval of the first futures-based ether ETF. A decision from the SEC is expected on or before mid-October.  The industry will likely push for more crypto ETFs, emboldened by trust issuer Grayscale's recent court victory against the SEC, broker Bernstein said in a report last month. A spot ETH ETF will be a top contender, the report said, given its similar market structure to BTC with actively traded futures and spot markets on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a key regulated marketplace for institutional investors.

42419676,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFI2n,1694021700,The Protocol: Ethereum Learns of Potential Defector as ‘Supreme Court’ Mooted,"The blockchain industry remains mired in crypto winter, with the price of bellwether bitcoin (BTC) down 11% in the past month. But there’s no slowing down in the race among technologists to position for the future. In the past week MakerDAO’s Rune Christensen, a pioneer of decentralized finance, signaled his openness to abandon the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem for rival technology from Solana or Cosmos, as the project searches for its own dedicated blockchain. Separately, a debate broke out over whether Ethereum should have its own “Supreme Court” to arbitrate disputes.  This week’s feature focuses on blockchain “sequencers” – a crucial element of the fast-growing infrastructure for “layer-2” networks atop Ethereum. Sequencers have been in the headlines recently, partly because they’re sometimes cast as single points of failure that could undermine the design principle of decentralization. Our Sam Kessler explains.  You're reading The Protocol, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that explores the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Subscribe here to get it every week.  Network news  SOLANA SEDUCTION: MakerDAO, one of the oldest and biggest decentralized-finance (DeFi) protocols on the Ethereum blockchain, is considering moving to its own dedicated blockchain. And rather than simply start a new layer-2 network within the dominant Ethereum ecosystem – as crypto-friendly firms like Coinbase and Consensys have chosen to do – MakerDAO might be looking to decamp altogether. Rune Christensen, MakerDAO’s founder, suggested last week that the project’s best bet might be to clone or “fork” the Solana blockchain – since it has the “most promising codebase.” In a governance forum post, he said Solana had demonstrated “technical quality” as well as “resilience by having gone through the FTX blowup.” (Solana was famously promoted by the collapsed FTX crypto exchange’s now-jailed founder, Sam Bankman-Fried.) Christensen went so far as to suggest the Cosmos blockchain’s technology as the “other main contender.” Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was apparently none too pleased, reportedly raising the question – in a post on a rival stablecoin project’s Discord channel – of whether “MakerDAO is torpedoing itself in weird directions” and then selling some 500 of the project’s MKR tokens (worth $579,000) that he had held since 2020. (Separately, in what might be a salt-in-the-wound moment, the credit-card network Visa announced Tuesday that it had expanded its stablecoin settlement capabilities to Solana, in addition to Ethereum.) On Wednesday, Solana Labs co-founder Raj Gokal told CoinDesk TV that the network was “battle-tested” and “ready for prime time.”  CODE VS. HUMANS: There’s an oft-repeated mantra in blockchain ideology that “code is law” – the idea that a network’s underlying programming should be sacrosanct, providing the ultimate authority to settle disputes even when serious emergencies or existential threats arise. Now, a top executive in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem is explicitly embracing the idea that, in certain extreme scenarios, humans rather than hard-coding might be the superior arbiters of justice. Alex Gluchowski, CEO of Matter Labs, the developer of a top layer 2 network on Ethereum, has floated the idea of an “Ethereum Supreme Court” to arbitrate disputes that escalate to the point of threatening the main blockchain’s integrity. The system, which Gluchowski described on X (formerly Twitter) as “a hierarchical system of on-chain courts similar to the real-world judiciary,” would allow apps built atop Ethereum to appeal for a chain “fork” in the event that they are hacked or face some other sort of security crisis. “Code is law, bug = death,” Gluchowski wrote in a follow-up comment to his Sept. 2 post.  BASE’S NEW FANBASE: Just as the Friend.tech fad faded, sapping some of the post-launch adoration of Coinbase’s new Base layer-2 blockchain (as chronicled in last week’s The Protocol), there’s a new kid in town: Aerodrome Finance. The platform, which markets itself as the Base ecosystem’s “premiere liquidity engine and hub,” has quickly attracted more than $170 million of TVL or “total value locked,” helping to push the overall TVL of protocols on Base to more than $400 million. The secret? According to the newsletter Wu Blockchain, the project’s “native token, $AERO, offers liquidity mining rewards with an annualized yield close to 1,000% without compounding.” That’s a lot, even in crypto. Aerodrome’s TVL has now exceeded – “flippened” in crypto jargon – the $158 million on Velodrome, Aerodome’s predecessor project, which sits on the older layer-2 chain Optimism. Is it sustainable? “Money doesn’t materialize out of thin air,” Wu Blockchain noted dryly, so “it’s worth considering when this spiral might come to an end.” (A Base zit: On Tuesday, the network suffered a “major outage” that lasted a little over three hours, its biggest glitch since the launch last month.)  Also:  FIRST ON COINDESK: Coinbase has quietly created a crypto lending service geared toward large investors, helping to fill the void left by last year’s blowups of firms like Genesis and BlockFi.  X, the Elon Musk-owned social media platform formerly called Twitter, has obtained payments licenses from several U.S. states in recent months – including a currency transmitter license in Rhode Island last week.  MetaMask, the popular crypto wallet, unveiled a new “Sell” feature that “allows you to cash out your crypto for fiat currency easily,” in a post on X. The feature is available in the U.S., UK and parts of Europe, “initially supporting ETH on Ethereum mainnet, with plans to expand to native gas tokens on layer 2 networks soon,” according to the company. Funds can be sent to a bank account or PayPal balance.  Protocol Village  Highlighting blockchain tech upgrades and developments.  Swift, the interbank messaging system, said it conducted successful experiments with several major banks including Citi and BNP Paribas, to transfer simulated tokenized assets between wallets on public and private blockchains. “Chainlink was used as an enterprise abstraction layer to securely connect the Swift network to the Ethereum Sepolia network, while Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) enabled complete interoperability between the source and destination blockchains,” according to a press release from Swift.  Curve, decentralized stablecoin exchange, deploys on Coinbase’s new layer-2 blockchain, Base.  Community members of dYdX, a decentralized derivatives-trading platform, approved a governance proposal to make its DYDX token – currently on Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard – the native token for its new standalone dYdX application-specific blockchain chain built with Cosmos SDK. As part of the proposal, the community agreed to adopt an Ethereum smart contract commissioned by the dYdX Foundation that, once deployed, “would enable a permissionless and autonomous one-way bridge for the DYDX token to be migrated from Ethereum to the dYdX Chain.”  Trust Machines, a startup developing applications for the Bitcoin blockchain and led by Stacks co-creator Muneeb Ali, announced Aug. 31 that it has acquired wallet assets from Hiro Systems (where Ali serves as chairman) and has now launched its own flagship Bitcoin wallet brand, Leather. According to a blog post, the wallet can secure and manage bitcoin (BTC), Stacks L2 (STX) and BRC-20 tokens, and can be used to create, trade and transfer Ordinals, Stacks NFTs and Bitcoin Stamps. The former Hiro Wallet had 375,000 total installations and more than 100,000 monthly active users, according to the company.  Money Center  Fundraisings  EXCLUSIVE: Socket, a protocol aimed at enhancing communication between blockchains, has raised $5 million from the crypto-friendly venture-capital funds Coinbase Ventures and Framework Ventures.  Story Protocol, set up to track intellectual property, conducted a follow-on fundraising in the third quarter, which, in conjunction to an earlier seed round, brings the total raised by the project to $54 million, according to the team.

42419658,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFHlF,1694021609,Crypto Lenders Caused Crypto Contagion Last Year. How Is the Industry Rebuilding?,"Loans are as old as money. Throughout history, whether seeds or gold, every form of currency has had its lending market. Now, Bitcoin, with its decentralized and transparent nature, has staked its own claim in the financial landscape. And just like the currencies that came before it, for Bitcoin to truly thrive, it also needs a robust lending market.  Mauricio Di Bartolomeo is the co-founder of Ledn, a digital currency lending company.  However, thus far, most attempts to create a bitcoin credit market have failed spectacularly, with disastrous repercussions.  The demand for bitcoin and digital asset lending services surged during the 2020 run-up, with 10s of billions of client assets flowing towards both centralized and decentralized lending platforms.  Fueled in part by lax macroeconomic monetary policies and the crypto sector's explosive growth, this environment allowed bad actors to operate recklessly, misleading consumers without facing significant checks and balances.  This lack of oversight ultimately led to the collapse of the digital asset lending industry beginning in 2022, including the cascading bankruptcies of lenders including BlockFi, Celsius and a unit of Genesis.  Although accusations of fraud in some of these cases will be a matter for the courts to decide, the sudden domino-like collapse of dozens of digital asset lending firms highlighted an underlying flaw: their operating structures were inherently unsustainable.  These structures lacked a crucial ""ring-fencing"" of lending risk, and lenders did not provide the transparency needed for clients to understand their credit underwriting process or the concentration risks in their lending activities.  This outdated structure, coupled with insufficient risk management, was akin to dry wood eagerly awaiting a spark — and Terra/Luna, Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and FTX were an entire box of matches.  See also: A Timeline of the Meteoric Rise and Crash of UST and LUNA | Opinion  Historically, a lending model without ring-fenced risks is viable only when a lender of last resort exists, such as the Federal Reserve in the context of traditional banks.  This backstop doesn’t exist for Bitcoin, which means the industry needs to develop a new model — one that doesn’t lean on government or state institutions.  Why Bitcoin needs a lending ecosystem  Many investors have reaped impressive returns on their bitcoin and other digital assets via yield offerings. Such services allow digital asset holders to generate passive income, mirroring the benefits typically enjoyed by investors in traditional finance.  Predominantly, these yields are a result of lending assets to institutional market makers.  Bitcoin lending has not only facilitated capital access for market makers in the bitcoin derivatives domain (i.e. futures and options markets) but has also been instrumental in the sector's growth.  Derivatives, which give investors the options to buy or sell based upon pre-arranged agreements and were first used to hedge risks of agricultural harvests, has contributed to reduced bitcoin's price volatility and helped keep more consistent prices across exchanges.  By capitalizing on price discrepancies between different exchanges, market makers have been exceptionally effective in narrowing the bid-ask spread over time. This efficiency directly benefits consumers, ensuring they receive more dollars when they sell and more bitcoin when they buy and helping to stabilize bitcoin's price.  The lending market accelerates settlement processes among entities and offers a host of other benefits. Specifically, bitcoin lending gives the opportunity to earn yield, ensure narrower spreads for bitcoin transactions on global exchanges, stabilize bitcoin spot market prices, provide a healthy spot short market for honest actors to hedge positions in a tax-efficient manner and create a more efficient hedges for bitcoin miners.  Systemic weaknesses exposed  The 2022 events highlighted several systemic risks that need addressing, including the ring-fencing of individual product risk.  To give a general rundown of how firms like BlockFi, Celsius and Voyager failed, it has often been the case that crypto credit providers intertwined client assets with the risks of the company's yield products. This means that the client’s loan, backed by bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, was in jeopardy if a company’s “yield” initiative failed and led to bankruptcy.  Another hazard lies in concentration risk from lending counterparties, or the firms crypto lenders would work with to generate yield on client holdings.  Why Do Crypto Lenders Keep Blowing Up? | Opinion (2022)  When promised rates become unsustainable, these platforms face a dilemma: restrict lending to manageable limits and reduce client rates, or continue unchecked lending despite surpassing comfortable risk thresholds. Proper management of this concentration risk is fundamental to risk management.  Transparency can make or break these relationships. Take Voyager, for example, which reportedly tied up nearly 58% of their loan portfolio with Three Arrows Capital. Alarmingly, to our knowledge, 3AC did not provide essential financial statements to their lenders, a fundamental requirement for any lender to properly assess the financial health of their counterparties.  One can't help but wonder: Would clients have been so keen to lend to Voyager if they had the full picture from the start? Other firms had similar concentrations with Genesis and/or Alameda Research.  The blueprint for future success  After the rollercoaster that was the past 18 months, digital lending platforms are stepping up their game. Here’s the lowdown on what's changing at some firms:  The two-account system: Imagine having two wallets. In one, you simply keep your money safe with no fuss. In the other, you decide to invest a bit and hope to see it grow. That's what platforms are doing now. They're offering a ""safe"" account where digital assets remain largely untouched.  Then there's a more adventurous ""yield"" account. Here, assets get lent out, to generate returns. Of course, there's some risk involved, but it's all transparent from the get-go. This way, clients can pick what suits them best.  See also: What Crypto's Future Has to Do With LIBOR's Death | Opinion  To generate interest in the ""yield"" account, loans have to be made, which carries risk and why people get paid interest at all following textbook economic theory. A key distinction from this new model is that the benefits of loaning funds (i.e. earning yield) and risks of the loans are ""ring-fenced"" to the ""yield"" account. In theory, clients that are not participating do not face any risk of loss from the ""yield"" account loans and are ring-fenced from the platform as well as any insolvency risk (e.g. what happened with Celsius and BlockFi).  The big push for transparency: Many platforms have heard loud and clear that clients want to know what's happening with their money and are rolling out regular, easy-to-read reports. It's like a window into the lending world. You get to see who's borrowing, how much and for what.  Smart and diversified lending: Learning from the mistakes of Voyager and 3AC, firms are being much more cautious in extending too much credit to any one group. By lending little bits to many, the risk tied to one rotten egg doesn’t mess up the whole dozen.  The world of digital asset lending is growing up. Platforms are taking the bumps from the past, learning and building better. It's a sign of things moving in the right direction, with more transparency and smart choices leading the way.  Let’s embrace this shakeup and its lessons. The ""Wild West"" was fun while it lasted, but now? It’s high time for the age of Enlightenment in digital asset lending.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET,Mauricio  Di Bartolomeo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/06/crypto-lenders-caused-crypto-contagion-last-year-how-is-the-industry-rebuilding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec42862086a9b35e22a6a2f7d9aad390d8948435-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
17205994,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550298,1694021490,"PERP Spikes 90%, Perpetual Protocol Foundation Sends Tokens To Binance: Is This Good","PERP, the native token of Perpetual Protocol, is one of the top-performing assets, looking at price action in the past 48 hours. As of September 6, the token is changing hands at $0.78, adding roughly 90% from August 2023 highs. Amid this stellar performance, reports reveal that the Perpetual Protocol Foundation has transferred 903,000 PERP worth approximately $691,000 to Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volumes and client count. PERP Ripping Higher After Dumping In Q2 2023 According to Lookonchain, a blockchain analytic platform, the wallet associated with the foundation has been regularly moving tokens to Binance in the past few months, starting from March. At that time, PERP was trading at a relatively higher price, at around $1, looking at trackers like CoinMarketCap. Since then, however, the token has been on a downtrend. Related Reading: FDUSD Market Cap Jumps By 20% Following Binance Directive To illustrate, after peaking at about $1.22 in early March, PERP tanked by over 65% to $0.38 in June. A marginal increase from July before prices contracted to around $0.40 in August, bouncing to spot rates in the past few trading sessions. Looking at the PERP/USDT candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, buyers have the upper hand after a clear double bottom was printed following gains in early September. Whether the uptrend will continue and PERP has effectively bottomed after a rough few months is yet to be seen. What’s clear is that buyers appear to be in control, and PERP is trading at April 2023 levels, peeling back losses of the past four months. Perpetual Protocol TVL Remains Depressed, Will The Foundation Sell? Perpetual Protocol is a popular decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol allowing users to trade crypto perpetual futures with leverage trustlessly. Perpetuals are complex derivatives products with no expiry dates. Perpetual Protocol also supports concentrated liquidity, a feature first introduced in Uniswap v3. Moreover, it allows leverage of up to 10X. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV At Critical Support Line, Will Retest Be Successful? Through this exchange, DeFi users have an alternative to Binance or Coinbase, both centralized options. By September 6, the exchange’s total value locked (TVL) was steady at around $12 million, down from $18 million in late July 2023. Of note, PERP is rallying without any sharp increment in TVL, as DefiLlama data shows. Typically, outflow from a non-custodial wallet to a centralized exchange is interpreted as bearish in crypto circles. So far, trackers reveal that the Perpetual Protocol Foundation has 7 million PERP in Binance worth over $4.62 million. It is also not clear whether they plan to sell.

17205618,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550306,1694020961,Bitcoin Alternative ‘Bitcoin BSC’ Launches Presale on Binance Smart Chain With High APY Staking,"Aiming to offer a Bitcoin alternative to investors during the bear market, Bitcoin BSC token is off to an explosive start in its presale, having already raised close to $50,000 in just 24 hours. Investors have been dissatisfied with Bitcoin’s performance in recent weeks as the largest cryptocurrency is down 11% over the past month. On the other hand, Bitcoin clones like BTC20 and BTC 2.0 have outperformed the bearish crypto market and have shown remarkable bullish strength. Bitcoin BSC is another such token that is generating tremendous enthusiasm amongst investors, thanks to its stake-to-earn feature and flexible architecture. More importantly, it is giving a second chance to those investors who missed out on Bitcoin’s 2,570,000% bull rally. As a result, it is priced at just $0.99 in its ICO, denoting a point of time in early 2011 when BTC was trading below the $1 price mark. Maximise Your Returns With The Ground-Breaking Stake-To-Earn Feature New projects often run the risk of pump-and-dump price action after launch, making it hard for investors to trust them in the long term. However, Bitcoin BSC’s on-chain staking mechanism solves this issue. 69% of the entire $BTCBSC supply has been reserved to pay out staking rewards, which will be spread out over a lengthy 120-year period. As a result, the Bitcoin BSC staking rewards will run out around the same time when the last Bitcoin will be mined in 2140. Furthermore, the staking pool will follow Bitcoin’s block creation schedule and pay staking rewards to investors every 10 minutes. This ensures the token’s price stability after launch, while also generating attractive passive income for retail investors. Indeed, the Bitcoin BSC staking pool is currently offering over 14,000% APY. While this percentage will continue to decrease as more investors stake their tokens, the rewards will still be significantly higher than the industry standard of 3% – 5% APY. Investors can already start to stake their tokens to reap maximum returns – however, there is a minimum 7-day locking period. This stake-to-earn utility is the cornerstone of the Bitcoin BSC project – after all, similar tokens like BTC20 that offer the same utility have seen explosive bull rallies after launch. Bitcoin on Binance Chain Is Greener, Faster and More Powerful Bitcoin started the blockchain revolution back in 2009 and has remained the most popular cryptocurrency since. However, BTC is not without its flaws – the rigid architecture of its blockchain results in extremely slow and costly transactions. To combat this, the Bitcoin BSC project is designed on the BNB Smart Chain which is known for its flexible tools, massive user base and vibrant ecosystem. The BEP20 design of the $BTCBSC token also offers seamless compatibility with popular dApps like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. The BNB Smart Chain is also ideal for smart contract execution, which allows projects like Bitcoin BSC to continue to add utility depending upon the demand. The token also uses the Proof-Of-Stake consensus mechanism which affords it significant advantages over Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work. While Bitcoin transactions can cost up to $10 and take over 10 minutes to reach finality, the $BTCBSC transactions are completed within 5 seconds and cost less than 10 cents. Furthermore, the PoS mechanism requires significantly less energy consumption and is much more environment-friendly than Bitcoin’s PoW. The $BTCBSC smart contract has also recently been audited by the Coinsult security company, which did not reveal any safety risks. Buy Bitcoin BSC On Presale Bitcoin BSC Is Your Second Chance To Replicate Bitcoin’s Meteoric Rise Bitcoin hit its all-time high of $69K in November of 2021 and yet, just a decade ago, it was priced below the $1 mark. However, most investors were simply unaware of this opportunity in 2011 and failed to capitalise on it. However, the Bitcoin BSC project is now planning a rerun of Bitcoin’s all-time rally – similar to BTC in 2011, it is priced at just $0.99 and has a maximum token supply of 21 million. It also has a presale supply of 6,125,000 tokens which denotes the total number of Bitcoins that were in circulation in 2011. Due to Bitcoin’s recent struggles, experts believe that there is a robust demand for projects like Bitcoin BSC. Popular trader Jacob Bury, who has more than 20K subscribers on YouTube, predicts that the token will display 10x price growth after launch. The token has even been featured across major crypto publications like CoinTelegraph, BeInCrypto and CoinGape. However, the Bitcoin BSC presale has a hard cap of just $6.063 Million – if the token’s day 1 presale performance is any indication, this limit will sell out extremely quickly. Thus, interested buyers need to rush to the presale and acquire the token by swapping ETH, BNB or USDT in exchange for it.

42419659,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFHkD,1694017597,Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Argues for Blockchain 'Privacy Pools' to Weed Out Criminals,"Can blockchain protocols distinguish honest folk from criminals?  Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the Ethereum network, and four co-authors outlined a way of doing just that in a research paper released Wednesday, detailing a new technological feature called “privacy pools.”  This “smart contract-based privacy-enhancing protocol” is designed to separate transactions that involve criminal activity from those that come from honest users.  The paper, “Blockchain Privacy and Regulatory Compliance: Towards a Practical Equilibrium,” comes as concerns around privacy in blockchain have crescendoed, with governments cracking down on criminal groups who make use of privacy mixers to hide and launder funds.  One of the best-known privacy protocols is Tornado Cash, a crypto “mixer” that has been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury due to its alleged use by the North Korean hacking group Lazarus as a tool for money laundering.  Buterin acknowledged that Tornado Cash was a good solution to privacy issues, but that it had limited options to dissociate from criminal activity on the network.  Privacy pools that make use of zero-knowledge technology could theoretically solve part of this issue since they would give users privacy around transaction data while also distinguishing it from any criminal activity. By pooling honest transactions together, users could prove that their transactions come from one of the honest deposits.  “All users with ‘good’ assets have strong incentives and the ability to prove their membership in a ‘good’-only association set,” the paper says. “Bad actors, on the other hand, will not be able to provide that proof.”  As more regulators crack down on criminal activity on the blockchain, Buterin aims to show that these technological innovations can comply with regulations.  “In many cases, privacy and regulatory compliance are perceived as incompatible,” the authors wrote. “This paper suggests that this does not necessarily have to be the case, if the privacy-enhancing protocol enables its users to prove certain properties regarding the origin of their funds.”  Read more: Ethereum’s Buterin Expresses Concerns Over Sam Altman’s Worldcoin",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/06/ethereums-vitalik-buterin-argues-for-blockchain-privacy-pools-to-weed-out-criminals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd8b6b3d976bc927ff3e1d414a8c9f043cd1c7ce-1159x659.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Storm, a dual U.S. and Russian citizen, will be released on a $2 million personal recognizance bond secured by his residence in Washington state and co-signed by one “financially responsible” person, Judge Katherine Polk Failla said at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Storm can only travel between his home base and the central district of California, the southern and eastern districts of New York and New Jersey for pre-trial hearings.

Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Is Nearing In On The 1.2 Level As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained, the 1.2 level of the MVRV ratio has historically been a support line for the cryptocurrency. The “MVRV ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and the realized cap. The “realized cap” here refers to a capitalization model for BTC that assumes the real value of each coin in circulation isn’t the current spot price but rather the price at which the coin was last bought/transacted on the blockchain. As the realized cap considers the cost basis or acquisition price of each investor in the market, the model essentially represents the total capital that the holders have put into the asset. Thus, comparing the market cap against the realized cap in the MVRV ratio can provide hints about whether the investors are holding more or less value than they put in. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Dominance Rises To Record Levels, Bullish Sign? When the ratio’s value is greater than 1, it means that the market as a whole is sitting on some profits right now. Generally, the higher the MVRV goes above this mark, the more probable corrections become for the asset as investors look to harvest their gains. On the contrary, the indicator below this mark can signal that BTC may be underpriced right now, as the average holder in the sector carries coins at a loss. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV ratio over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin MVRV ratio has been above the 1 mark during the past few months. The metric broke above this line in January when the rally started. Besides a retest in March, the indicator has remained above this level since then, implying that the holders have enjoyed profits. Related Reading: Here’s What Will Happen If Bitcoin Can Break $33,700 The 1 level has been important historically for the asset. Still, the quant notes that another value is notable: 1.2. This line has supported the asset a few times in the past, as the analyst has highlighted in the chart (the yellow boxes). Most recently, Bitcoin found support at this level in June, where the cryptocurrency could propel itself back up with a sharp rally. The metric is heading down and again approaching a retest of this line, as its current value is 1.27. Naturally, a successful retest could be positive news for Bitcoin, but a failure might lead to an extended drawdown for the asset’s price.

The new capital will expand Socket’s work with Coinbase, including providing bridging opportunities for developers and users of Coinbase Wallet and Base, the company’s new layer-2 network atop Ethereum.  With new layer-2 networks or “rollups” coming to market and more layer-1 blockchains going live, Socket sees itself as an important player in connecting these fragmented ecosystems, allowing chains to communicate with each other, according to the team. By providing a method to bridge assets, users are able to transact easier across multiple networks, theoretically making the experience feel like operating on one blockchain.  The fundraise comes as interoperability solutions, such as LayerZero, have garnered the attention of investors, who view bridging as an important feature for the future of blockchains. Last week, the inter-bank messaging system Swift disclosed it had conducted experiments to transfer tokenized value across multiple private and public blockchains, involving Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol.  “For us, to have this scalable future, rollup-to-rollup communication is really important,” said Vaibhav Chellani, the co-founder of Socket. “I think the scaling future, and the multi- or cross-chain future are the same thing.”  Read more: Coinbase Officially Launches Base Blockchain in Milestone for a Public Company",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LINK | MARKET,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/06/coinbase-framework-venture-funds-invest-5m-in-socket-protocol-in-bet-on-blockchain-interoperability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc26d1754115f5b208cf5b579e1af368da067263-1920x1087.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419674,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFI0j,1694015100,DeFi and Credit Risk,"We only find out if something is anti-fragile when it either breaks or evolves from adversity; decentralized finance (DeFi) has been through a lot, but it has never been broken. Instead, it established itself as a Darwinian sandbox for battle-testing new and old concepts in finance, economics, governance and property rights for the digital economy.  But what really differentiates DeFi from traditional finance? One of the main differences is how (most, but not all) major protocols treat credit risk.  In the simplest terms, DeFi swaps credit risk for smart contract risk.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Credit risk is part of just about every financial asset in traditional markets, but not so in DeFi. Everything from mortgages to CME corn futures, German bunds and Amazon gift cards has an embedded credit component (and cost). In DeFi, however, your credit record is entirely irrelevant. Your borrowing power in AAVE, for example, is determined only by the value of the collateral you put in. If it falls beyond the threshold and the smart contract functions correctly, your position is liquidated. There is no recourse, no one to call, no place to explain your situation.  On-chain structured products: Full transparency without credit risk  DeFi’s set-up is straightforward for simple financial products, like overcollateralised lending. But how can we implement a zero-credit-risk model and full transparency for products with complex, non-linear payoffs like exotic options and structured products?  The answer is to place the full payoff on-chain. For example, the latest vault deployed by Ribbon Finance (rebranded as Aevo) reproduces a classic TradFi structured product – the autocallable – in a smart contract. You can see further details here, but the point is that a smart contract executes the product’s conditional payoffs (like “if-this-then-that” statements in code) into the correct address in a transparent way. But most importantly, once the vault is created, neither Ribbon nor the investor have the option to default – i.e., zero credit risk.  Structured products and exotic options are a great example of how DeFi can lean into crypto’s transparency and “programmable money” properties. Automating complex payoffs is exactly the type of meaningful application that can put it on a sustained growth path. For reference, the global volume of structured products, like autocallables, was estimated at around $1.5 trillion in 2021, led by Asian investors, according to Luma and Morningstar.  DeFi endured countless hacks, rug pulls, de-pegs and regulatory scrutiny, and it will surely outlive the current downcycle in trading volume. But the sector might have a greater chance of adoption if it sets aside some of its lofty disruptive ideals (at least for now) and focuses on improving, even if marginally, financial solutions with demonstrable global demand and adoption.",NEUTRAL,AAVE,AAVE | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,"Ilan Solot, Mark Arasaratnam",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2023/09/06/defi-and-credit-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc3ebbce3db318773174c965c65a6c725fd25871-3456x2304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42409728,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOeD0,1694015100,Why Wealth Managers Are Choosing These Crypto Accounts,"Wealth managers are increasingly receiving client questions about investing in crypto and how clients can gain exposure to this asset class. Most financial advisers are unaware of the pros and cons of investment vehicles available to invest in digital assets on behalf of their clients.  Over the past 12 months, 90% of financial advisers have received client questions about crypto, according to The Bitwise/VettaFi 2023 Benchmark Survey of Financial Advisor Attitudes Toward Crypto Assets. RIAs and financial advisers must navigate a range of considerations when allocating to this asset class, most notably around security and compliance considerations. Advisers must be mindful of the characteristics of each structure as they select the proper investment vehicle.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The current options for financial advisers are:  instructing the client to move assets away and invest self-directed at a retail crypto exchange (e.g., Coinbase)  over-the-counter trust (e.g., the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust)  private funds  investing through a crypto separately managed account (SMA).  Separately managed accounts have been growing rapidly over the past 10 years, with assets under management growing from $550 billion in 2011 to $1.7 trillion in 2021. Wealth managers chose SMAs due to the key advantages of tax optimization, direct ownership, professional management and customization. For those same reasons, the wealth management market is steadily adopting crypto SMAs as the vehicle of choice to invest in this emerging asset class. Below are some of the benefits:  Tax Optimization: The crypto market is volatile relative to other asset classes, creating attractive tax optimization opportunities. When an investor utilizes a crypto SMA, an account is opened in their name at a digital asset qualified custodian, allowing the investor to own the digital assets directly. This structure enables tax optimization in these accounts unavailable in the OTC trust or private fund structure. Crypto SMAs often have a tax overlay strategy that will find opportunities to reduce or offset the client’s capital gain tax liability, like traditional SMAs.  Direct Ownership: Direct ownership is the best structure from an investment vehicle perspective. There is minimal tracking error compared to other products, such as an OTC public trust, which can have meaningful premiums and discounts and, thus, tracking error. Further, there is 24/7 liquidity for crypto SMAs, allowing investors and advisers to sell or buy anytime.  Reporting Integration: Crypto SMA providers can integrate directly with wealth managers reporting platforms (e.g., Orion, Addepar, Black Diamond), allowing advisers to model, report and bill seamlessly on their clients' digital asset holdings.  Professional Management: In an emerging and complex asset class such as crypto, the expertise of professional management is even more valuable than traditional asset classes. An emerging asset class is difficult to keep up with to the extent needed to make proper allocation decisions. By utilizing crypto SMAs, an adviser can benefit from outsourcing digital asset portfolio management and trading to specialists with deep expertise in the digital asset market.  Institutional Custody: An adviser can use a crypto SMA to take advantage of an institutional-grade custodian in an emerging asset class. Given crypto’s security risk and compliance considerations, working with an established and qualified custodian is essential. Client assets are typically held at a custodian who maintains both a SOC 1 and SOC 2 from a recognized accounting firm, undergoes internal audits and is subject to regulatory oversight requirements (including capital requirements) from the New York State Department of Financial Services. The institutional-grade custodian provides institutional cold storage, trading, and security.

42409719,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOdfw,1694012400,‘Sequencers’ Are Blockchain’s Air Traffic Control. Here’s Why They’re Misunderstood,"Cheap and speedy “rollup” networks like Arbitrum, Optimism and Coinbase’s Base are quickly becoming attractive alternatives to conducting transactions on the oft-congested Ethereum network. Transactions are completed on these “layer 2” networks and then recorded for posterity on Ethereum.  But much has been made recently of these layer 2 networks’ reliance on a crucial piece of infrastructure known as the “sequencer,” which is responsible for bundling up transactions from users and shepherding them down to Ethereum.  The sequencer is like “the air traffic controller for the specific L2 ecosystem that it serves,” Sandy Peng, co-founder of the Scroll rollup, explained this week in an interview. “So when Alice and Bob attempt to make a transaction at the same time, who comes first? That’s decided by the sequencer.”  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  When people make transactions on a “layer 2” rollup network, a sequencer is responsible for verifying, ordering and compressing those transactions into a package that can be shipped down to the layer 1 chain, such as Ethereum. In return for its efforts, the sequencer is paid a small portion of the fees collected from users.  A criticism of the setup is that today’s rollup sequencers are typically run by “centralized” entities, and thus represent single points of failure, potential vectors for transaction censorship, or possibly a choke point if authorities ever chose to shut it all down. Coinbase, for example, runs the sequencer for its new Base blockchain, a role that could produce an estimated $30 million of net revenue annually, based on estimates by the analysis firm FundStrat.  It's not just Base. Today’s leading rollups all rely on “centralized” sequencers, meaning a single party – generally, the company that built the rollup – takes care of sequencing all by itself. Options for “decentralizing” this system are on the way, but Ethereum’s biggest layer 2s have yet to embrace it – or simply haven’t gotten around to it.  In the world of blockchains, where trust is supposed to be minimized, people tend to bristle at the idea of a single company controlling a pivotal element of how a chain operates.  Talk to experts, though, and one comes away with the impression that bigger risks to layer 2 decentralization and security lie elsewhere.  What are sequencers?  Coinbase’s buzzy new Base network works like other layer 2 rollups: It promises users quick and cheap transactions that ultimately “settle” on the main Ethereum chain.  Alongside convenience, the main selling point of a rollup like Base is that it runs directly on top of the main Ethereum network – meaning it is engineered to borrow its main security apparatus.  When a user submits a transaction on Base, a sequencer node swoops in and rolls it up into a compressed “batch” of transactions from other users. The sequencer then hands those transactions down to Ethereum, where they are officially cemented into its ledger.  Similar to how the other big rollups operate, Coinbase is currently the only sequencer on Base – meaning the company is solely responsible for ordering and batching transactions from Base users.  On Coinbase’s quarterly earnings call last month with Wall Street analysts, CEO Brian Armstrong made a nod to the role that this setup plays in the context of Base’s business model: “Base will be monetized through what are called sequencer fees,” said Armstrong. “Sequencer fees can be earned when any transaction is executed on Base, and basically, Coinbase can run one of these sequencers as others can over time.”  Technology exists for decentralized L2 sequencing – spreading out the sequencer role across multiple parties.  Coinbase says it eventually plans to embrace this tech, and other rollup platforms say they plan to do the same. But thus far, decentralized sequencers have proven difficult to implement at scale without slowing things down or introducing security risks.  The juicy revenue that comes from running the sequencer might seem like a disincentive to decentralize. That goes too for the potential maximal extractable value (MEV) opportunities introduced by centralized sequencing – extra profit that can be drawn from users by strategically ordering how their transactions are executed.  In the meantime, today’s centralized sequencer setups bring risks for users.  Binance zeroed in on the problems in a recent research report: “As the sequencer controls the ordering of transactions, it has the power to censor user transactions (although complete censorship is unlikely as users can submit transactions directly to the L1),” the report stated. “The sequencer can also extract the maximal extractable value (“MEV”), which could be economically harmful to the user base. Furthermore, liveness can be a major issue, i.e., if the sole, centralized sequencer goes down, then the entire rollup gets affected.”  Sequencer systems are likely to remain centralized for the foreseeable future – meaning these risks are likely to stick around for some time. But when it comes to layer 2 security concerns, sequencers may be a red herring.  There are bigger risks  Blockchain users mostly care that their transactions are processed as expected, and their wallets are safe from unauthorized transactions of lost funds.  If they act maliciously, centralized sequencers can theoretically slow things down or re-order transactions to extract MEV – but they don’t generally have the ability to fully censor, augment or spoof new transactions.  “When it comes to the things that make an L2 a good L2,” said Peng, decentralizing sequencers “is lower down on our priority list.”  Notably, the popular Optimism rollup – which Coinbase used as the template for building its own Base chain – currently lacks fraud proofs, which are algorithms on the layer 1 chain that can “prove” that layer 2 transactions have been recorded accurately.  “More than decentralized sequencers, the important part is to actually implement fraud proofs or validity proofs and to have an escape hatch mechanism,” said Anurag Arjun, founder of the data availability-focused Avail blockchain.  Fraud proofs are the primary means by which rollup networks like Optimism and Base are supposed to “borrow” Ethereum’s security – allowing validators on the main Ethereum chain to check that an L2 network is working as advertised.  “The whole point of rollups is that you construct this mechanism so that the rollups themselves don't have to introduce cryptoeconomic security,” said Arjun. “At a large scale, that's the point of inheriting from the base layer.”  Without fraud proofs, says Arjun, Optimism, Base and other roll-up networks with similar missing features are essentially asking users to trust their own security practices rather than Ethereum’s.  Optimism and Base also lack an “escape hatch” mechanism for users to withdraw their funds onto Ethereum in the event that a sequencer fails.  “If there is an escape hatch mechanism” and the sequencer fails or goes offline, explains Arjun, “you can actually bridge back your assets and safely exit.” Without an escape hatch, rollup users can potentially lose their funds in the event that things go wrong.  Stages of a rollup  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a set of stages, numbered zero to two, for classifying the decentralization of different rollup networks. The staging criteria are meant to recognize that new rollup networks tend to rely on “training wheels” in order to safely test and deploy to the public before they ultimately decentralize.  L2Beat, a layer 2 watchdog, tracks how different platforms stack up, according to Buterin’s model. Every leading rollup network, according to L2Beat, currently relies on some kind of training wheels.  Until they have working fraud proofs, Optimism and Base will be considered “stage 0” under Buterin’s classification scheme. The most direct competitor to Optimism and Base, Arbitrum scores more highly because it – despite having a centralized sequencer – has fraud proofs.  Arbitrum, too, has shortcomings preventing it from “stage 2” status – currently, it’s still generally considered a “stage 1” rollup.  The training wheels of L2Best documents stretch from the lack of fraud proofs (or validity proofs, in the case of ZK rollups) to centralized upgrade controls.  If the L2 watchdog shows anything, it’s that centralized sequencers are far from the biggest issue L2 platforms will need to contend with in order to make good on the promise of “borrowing” Ethereum’s security.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/06/everybody-in-blockchains-talking-about-sequencers-heres-why-theyre-misunderstood,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a4c12f5bc3f627aee94576ae0d57323c31c73f86-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

FDUSD, a dollar-pegged stablecoin, was recently launched on June 1, 2023, debuting on the Ethereum network and the BNB Smart Chain. The token was officially listed for specific trading pairs on the crypto exchange in July. Related Reading: Binance Will Halt These 39 Liquidity Mining Pools This Week Binance’s Directive Drives Adoption Of FDUSD On August 31, Binance confirmed reports of intention to halt support for Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin following the regulatory embargo on the token’s issuance. Back in March, The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) had ordered Paxos Trust, the issuing company of BUSD, to cease minting the stablecoin. Since then, BUSD’s market supply has taken a nosedive, crashing by over 80% in the last eight months. According to an official post, the exchange will begin the gradual termination of all BUSD products on its platform, urging its 150 million customers to swap their BUSD tokens for other assets before February 2024. In particular, the crypto exchange encouraged users to convert their BUSD to FDUSD, touting incentives such as zero trading fees and a 1:1 direct swap ratio. According to data from CoinMarketCap, FDUSD’s market cap value has grown by 21.49% from August 31, rising from $324.75 million to its current value of $394.68 million. This indicates that Binance’s promotion of FDUSD as a BUSD alternative is paying dividends, resulting in a rapid rise in the former’s adoption over the last few days. For context, the market cap metric represents the total value of a cryptocurrency based on its market price and the number of circulating tokens. Since FDUSD is a stablecoin with a fixed value of $1, CoinMarketCap’s data means that over 70 million FDUSD tokens entered circulation over the past week. In addition, according to the DeFi analytics platform, DeFiLlama, FDUSD now ranks as the ninth largest stablecoin in the crypto market ahead of other popular assets such as Gemini USD (GUSD).

This move comes a week after Binance announced the “gradual” discontinuation of its support for the BUSD token while directing users to convert their BUSD token to other assets. The exchange has begun discontinuing by delisting eight BUSD isolated and cross-margin pairs. Following these announcements, the BUSD market fall continues, with the token’s market share now valued at an all-time low of $2.73 billion.

Revenue is growing, but the balance sheet is in tough shape and dilution appears imminent. From the user's standpoint, fees are very high and the unbanked population in the company's current geographic market is relatively small. Arguably one of the lesser-known public equities in the world of cryptocurrencies is Bitcoin Depot ( BTM ). Bitcoin Depot operates a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ATM business and came public via SPAC merger in late-June. It's been a rough go for stockholders as the price is currently down over 70% since the company came public. 6mo Performance (Seeking Alpha) In this article, we'll look at Bitcoin Depot's business model, latest earnings report, and try to determine whether the stock is worth a look after such an aggressive selloff. The Business Model As mentioned in the introduction, Bitcoin Depot operates a Bitcoin ATM, or ""BTM"" business. The company currently touts nearly 12,000 Bitcoin Depot locations and has primarily serviced the unbanked or underbanked consumer in the US and Canada. When a customer wants to buy Bitcoin with cash, they are able to do so by using one of Bitcoin Depot's machines with the delivery of the asset going to the wallet address of the user's choosing. Fund Flow (Bitcoin Depot) While the company has developed an application that is intended to help streamline purchasing, the wallet itself is non-custodial. When a user deposits cash into the kiosk, BTC comes out of Bitcoin Depot's hot wallet and the funds are deposited to the buyer's address. In addition to the physical kiosks, the company also has non-kiosk BTC purchase availability through its BDCheckout service where customers can buy BTC at checkout registers of integrated retailers or through debit card purchases directly on the company's website. For the third consecutive quarter, the median transaction size at the company's kiosks was about $200 and Bitcoin Depot is positioning itself as a Bitcoin-business that is uncorrelated to the price volatility of Bitcoin. Volume Uncorrelated to BTC price (Bitcoin Depot) Even as Bitcoin sold off dramatically from a Q4-21 high near $70k, Bitcoin Depot has continued to generate more transaction volume despite the lack of market FOMO that was witnessed a couple years ago. Q2-23 Earnings & Balance Sheet In the second quarter, Bitcoin Depot reported $197.5 million in total revenue; an 18% improvement over the prior year period. Cost of revenue grew slightly less at just 12% from $149.2 million last year to $167.2 million this year. This helped Bitcoin Depot improve gross profit margin from 8% in Q2-22 to 13% in the recently reported quarter. Despite those improvements in both revenue and gross profit margin, the company flipped from $4.1 million in Q1-23 net income to a net loss of $4 million in Q2-23. This shift from profitable to net loss was almost entirely attributable to a PIPE financing agreement that added an additional $9.2 million in expenses in Q2. From a balance sheet standpoint, I view Bitcoin Depot's current position as less than ideal: Millions June 30th, 2023 December 31st, 2022 Cash & Equivalents $27.4 $37.5 Current Assets $32.7 $40.4 Total Assets $77.9 $93.4 Current Liabilities $51.7 $46.8 Total Liabilities $73.2 $83.9 Source: Bitcoin Depot, Q2-23 10Q (unaudited) The company has enough cash to get through another few quarters, but things are going to get tight by 2025. Bitcoin Depot has more current liabilities than current assets and the company recently refinanced a $21 million note at 17% interest that matures in June 2026. $16.1 million of that obligation is non-current and there's a $1.7 million exit fee on top of the debt and the interest. Service Charges Are A Concern As a kiosk business, Bitcoin Depot has costs of revenue that other crypto on-ramp businesses like exchanges don't have. For instance, Bitcoin Depot pays retailers to lease the space where the kiosks are physically located. Additionally, the company has to pay for armored security and transportation of the cash deposits that it receives at the kiosks. These costs are passed down to the customer and it makes for what I view as an uneconomical transaction for the end-user. While Bitcoin Depot's app has an average 4.3 rating through both the iOS and the Google Play app stores, the ""most relevant"" reviews read very similar to this one from October 23rd, 2022 via Google Play store: Although the ATM transaction itself did work, the way they list the price is misleading and their actual markup is very high. All of the top 4 most relevant reviews on Google Play as measured by helpful votes garnered 1-star ratings with fees generally being the common critique. However, Bitcoin Depot also offers online sales with debit or credit cards but the take rate is even high for the company's online purchases: Online Purchase 9/5/23 (Bitcoin Depot) In the screenshot above, I'm showing what would be an average $200 Bitcoin buy through the company's online purchase option. At current Bitcoin spot pricing, the buyer would receive less than $175 in BTC when buying the digital asset this way. This is uncompetitive versus something like Moonpay which would yield the buyer closer to $186 on a $200 purchase and that company offers more than just one digital asset. Of course, the kiosk business is overwhelmingly the revenue driver for Bitcoin Depot as it accounted for over 99.5% of the company's total revenue through the first 6 months of 2023. Additional Risks As a company operating a Bitcoin-based business, Bitcoin Depot is exposed to many of the same risks that fundamentally impact every other company in the industry. One such concern is the demand for the product or service could diminish over time. Also, regulatory compliance could be difficult as Bitcoin Depot still lacks a New York Bitlicense after nearly three years trying to acquire one and there isn't a real time table for when the Bitlicense may be received. Country Total Population (Millions) Unbanked Population (%) Cash Transactions (%) Card Transactions (%) Internet Penetration (%) Morocco 36.9 71 41 27 62 Vietnam 97.3 69 26 35 66 Egypt 102.3 67 55 27 45 Philippines 109.6 66 37 22 60 Mexico 128.9 63 21 44 66 USA 331 7 4 59 89 Canada 37.7 0 3 73 93 Source: Merchant Machine via GFMag , 2021 Interestingly, the company currently operates in just two countries, the US and Canada. Each of which have much smaller unbanked segments of their populations compared to other countries that could theoretically benefit more from Bitcoin Depot's more cash-focused services. However, roughly two-thirds of Bitcoin Depot's clients are using the service for remittances and online purchases. This may be an indication that there is actually a fairly good product market fit in North America if those funds are being purchased to be sent elsewhere globally. Summary There are other concerns to be aware of. In my view, Bitcoin Depot is fairly reliant on one retailer with Circle K accounting for roughly a third of the company's transaction volume. There's also substantial dilution risk in holding BTM shares given all of the warrants and recent share registration . I think Bitcoin Depot is actually a somewhat interesting concept but I think those fees are tough to overlook. As traditional financial firms appear poised to enter the Bitcoin and crypto arenas, it's not out of the realm of possibility that the current ATM infrastructure providers could start competing in this space domestically and abroad. It's also not out of the realm of possibility that stablecoins could take share of remittances from Bitcoin. As a Bitcoin-only seller, this would have a negative impact on Bitcoin Depot and with less than 30% of the company's surveyed users buying BTC as an investment or store or value, I think stablecoin adoption is a legitimate long term concern. Bitcoin Depot has the market share lead in the US-based Bitcoin kiosk space, but I ultimately can't get passed the fees or the plethora of other issues. I'm staying away from this one for now.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4633363-bitcoin-depot-analog-approach-to-digital-currency?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/17197601.jpeg

17195395,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550233,1694005213,"Bitcoin HODLer Dominance Rises To Record Levels, Bullish Sign?","On-chain data shows the divergence between the Bitcoin long-term holders and short-term holders has grown to record levels recently. Bitcoin Market Has Been Continuing Its Shift Towards HODLing As an analyst in a post on X explained, the gap between the speculators and HODLers in the market has only grown wider recently. The “short-term holders” (STHs) and the “long-term holders” (LTHs) are the two primary cohorts that the entire Bitcoin market can be divided into. The STHs refer to all those investors who purchased their coins less than 155 days ago, while the LTHs include the holders who have been holding onto their tokens beyond that period. Statistically, the longer an investor keeps their coins dormant, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. Due to this reason, the STHs are usually the group with the weaker conviction of the two. The LTHs often hold through volatile periods in the asset without moving an inch, which has earned them the popular name “diamond hands.” The STHs, on the other hand, tend to sell quickly whenever FUD emerges in the sector, or a profitable selling opportunity appears. Related Reading: Here’s What Will Happen If Bitcoin Can Break $33,700 Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the supplies of these BTC investor groups throughout the history of the cryptocurrency: Looks like the two metrics have been going in opposite directions to each other | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X The graph shows that the Bitcoin LTH supply has been on an uptrend during the past couple of years, while the STH supply has been going down recently. This would suggest that the overall supply of the cryptocurrency is continuously becoming more dormant. The gap between these groups is the widest it has ever been, as the LTH supply is nearing the 15 million BTC mark, while the STH supply has dropped under the 2.5 million BTC level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchanges See Three Straight Months Of Withdrawals For First Time Ever The latter’s latest value is the lowest it has ever been since 2011 when the asset was still in its infancy. It would appear that short-term speculators in the market have thinned to record lows. Last month, Bitcoin witnessed a sharp crash from above the $29,000 level to below the $26,000 mark, and the asset has not recovered. As is apparent from the chart, though, the LTHs haven’t cared about the asset’s struggle at all, as their supply has only continued to head up while the STHs have shrunken down further. The LTH group remaining strong and continuing its growth may not affect the market in the short-term, but during longer periods, the supply continuing to become locked in the wallets of these HODLers could have a bullish impact due to how supply-demand dynamics work. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around the $25,700 mark, registering a dip of 6% over the past week.

42409731,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOeJc,1694005200,Looking at Uniswap and Crypto’s New Favorite Ruling,"A ruling dismissing a putative class action lawsuit against Uniswap will almost definitely come up again in other lawsuits involving securities law and crypto entities.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Applying securities law  The narrative  A federal judge dismissed an aspiring class action lawsuit filed against decentralized exchange Uniswap and creator Hayden Adams, saying the plaintiffs had filed against the wrong defendants and, perhaps more importantly, that federal securities laws don’t really create a clear avenue for the plaintiffs to sue the real defendants.  Why it matters  This ruling will almost certainly be cited by various parties, particularly entities and individuals facing lawsuits from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Breaking it down  Last week’s ruling, by Judge Katherine Polk Failla, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, dismissed allegations by a group of crypto investors hoping to hold Uniswap liable for “scam tokens” traded on the decentralized exchange.  In the judge’s words, the issuers of the tokens were really the ones responsible for the investors’ losses. The problem is, the investors can’t sue the issuers because they can’t identify them, and Uniswap does not stand in for them in light of this, she said.  “Due to the Protocol’s decentralized nature, the identities of the Scam Token issuers are basically unknown and unknowable, leaving Plaintiffs with an identifiable injury but no identifiable defendant,” the judge wrote. “Undaunted, they now sue the Uniswap Defendants and the VC Defendants, hoping that this Court might overlook the fact that the current state of cryptocurrency regulation leaves them without recourse, at least as to the specific claims alleged in this suit.”  The judge ruled that the smart contracts underpinning Uniswap and its liquidity pools operated in a way that did not specifically harm the investors, distinguishing them from the token issuers she is holding liable.  One of the lines everyone on the social media platform that’s recently been renamed X seemed to focus on implied that the SEC may not be the right authority to define token issuers or Uniswap’s role within securities law.  “The Court declines to stretch the federal securities laws to cover the conduct alleged, and concludes that Plaintiffs’ concerns are better addressed to Congress than to this Court,” the judge wrote.  And later on she added that few token issuers have registered with the SEC “as Congress and the courts have yet to make a definitive determination as to whether such tokens constitute securities, commodities, or something else.”  A number of token issuers have registered their projects with the SEC, but almost all did so as part of a settlement with the regulator after being sued.  To be clear, the SEC wasn’t a part of this case. This was a group of private investors suing Uniswap and doing so under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. That said, some, if not many defendants against SEC suits are going to use this ruling to argue that the regulator does not currently have adequate jurisdiction over things like crypto token issuers or third-party trading platforms.  The judge also noted that “regulators may someday address this gray area,” pointing out that SEC Chair Gary Gensler has already “warned that decentralized finance projects were under increased scrutiny,” indicating those who might have incentive structures tied to their development of decentralized exchanges or other tools.  Whether other judges agree, and whether the facts and circumstances of those cases are similar enough to warrant a similar outcome, seem a bit less clear to me.  One other detail that an individual following the case pointed out to me: the judge wrote that “it defies logic that a drafter of computer code underlying a particular software platform could be liable under Section 29(b) [of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934] for a third-party’s misuse of that platform.”  Judge Katherine Polk Failla is also the judge overseeing the DOJ’s case against Tornado Cash developer and co-founder Roman Storm, who prosecutors charged with conspiracy for developing a platform that third parties used to launder a billion in stolen crypto funds. Of course, it’s worth highlighting that the Tornado Cash case isn’t a securities law issue and the specific facts and circumstances are different (prosecutors allege Storm maintained some control over Tornado Cash and stood to directly profit from the mixer’s use because of the TORN token, for example).

42409730,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOeGJ,1694001883,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Still Stuck in Limbo,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) has remained almost entirely locked below the $26,000 mark since Sept. 1, showing little to no signs of life. BTC is basically unchanged over 24 hours, down 0.1% at around $25,700. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is down by a negligible 0.04%. Investors are seemingly holding off making any substantial moves until further developments emerge, both in the cryptocurrency market and the wider economy. “It seems as though most of the speculative money has already fled the crypto space and the market participants are waiting for the Fed’s next move,” Yuya Hasegawa, a crypto market analyst at Japanese exchange Bitbank said.  Ether (ETH) will outperform bitcoin in September and October, according to crypto analytics firm K33. Given the high chances that the U.S.’ first ether ETF will be approved in mid-October, investors can ride the momentum that will drive ETH as the deadline approaches, according to senior analyst Vetle Lunde. September is a historically difficult month for BTC, having recorded negative returns in that month every year since 2016. The odds, therefore, are “stacked in favor of ETH,” Lunde said, citing the 60% gain that bitcoin made in the three weeks prior to its first U.S. futures-based ETF winning approval in 2021.  The first legally issued digital security could be available to retail investors later this month. SOMA Finance, a joint venture between decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) MANTRA and FINRA-registered broker dealer Tritaurian Capital, plans to sell up to $5 million in tokens that will give the holders the right to a dividend on profits. The SOMA tokens will actually represent a financial interest, given the token would be a non-cumulative, participating preferred stock of SOMA.finance, the company said. This would address the criticism that crypto tokens don’t represent a financial claim on the equity or debt of the issuer.  Chart of the Day  Despite lingering regulatory risks, Binance remains the dominant exchange in the crypto market.  Binance's bitcoin-tether (BTC/USDT) pair accounts for 86% of the global BTC spot market trading volume this year, according to data tracked by FRNT Financial.  The data shows why Binance is often considered too big to fail.

17191814,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550239,1693999815,Turning Point For Bitcoin And Crypto? DXY At 5-Month High,"In a crucial development for the financial markets, the US Dollar Index (DXY) has surged to its highest level since March, marking a pivotal moment for Bitcoin and the broader crypto sector. The DXY, which gauges the Greenback’s performance against a basket of six major currencies, has extended its gains above the 104.000 mark in the past four day, reaching a five-month peak at 104.907. At press time, the DXY was trading at 104.773. From a technical standpoint, the DXY has exhibited a bullish bias, especially after surpassing the 200-day Moving Average (DMA) on Thursday last week. For the DXY to solidify its bullish stance, it needs to surpass the year-to-date (YTD) high of 105.882, which would then bring the 106.000 mark into focus. Surpassing this level could set the stage for the DXY to challenge the November 30 daily high of 107.195 and potentially rally towards March’s 21 high of 107.993. Related Reading: The Great Bitcoin Gap: Will BTC Plummet To Fill The Void At $19,500? However, on the flip side, if the DXY were to dip below 104.538, it could trigger a correction, targeting the 200-DMA (currently at $103.326). In the short term, while the DXY remains bullish, it must breach the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $105.368. Renowned macro analyst Henrik Zeberg weighed in on the DXY’s trajectory, predicting that DXY bulls shouldn’t get too excited, “I just love this BEARISH – bullish move in DXY. Let the DXY Bulls get overly excited! Exactly what is needed for the reversal. 106.0 – 106.3 (is key).” How Will Bitcoin Respond To DXY’s Strength The inverse correlation between Bitcoin and the DXY has been a topic of interest in recent years. With the DXY’s recent surge, concerns are mounting about potential downward pressure on Bitcoin and crypto in the short-term. Some analysts believe that another uptick in the dollar could push Bitcoin towards the $23.500 mark, especially given the relatively low levels of open interest (OI) and volume for BTC. Related Reading: Here’s What Will Happen If Bitcoin Can Break $33,700 Glassnode founders Yann Allemann and Jan Happel provided insights into Bitcoin’s outlook, noting, “Mid-term outlook: Favorable risk/reward, but short-term, uncertain ($25.8k – $26.8k). Possible downside ($23.8k – $24.8k) due to bearish trend. Signs of bottoming: RSI bullish divergence, fading volatility. We’re close to the bottom, but the environment is still unstable.” Elaborating on the current market conditions, they added, “We’re in an unstable environment. Wait for the dip or buy the breakout. Bitcoin Risk Signal near extremes. $25.8k – $26.8k is No Man’s Land. The mid-term risk/reward is favorable for BTC and crypto.” Moreover, they predict that Bitcoin will bottom out in mid-September when the DXY reaches its top, setting Bitcoin and crypto up for a stellar October. At press time, BTC price remained stagnant below $27,800.

The approval was granted by the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), an international finance center within the United Arab Emirates that has been attempting to attract crypto-related businesses. The in-principle level is seen as the third step in a five-stage application process. The next stages involve getting final approval and going through an ""operational launch"" test, according to the ADGM guidance.  The ADGM was among the first to bring forth a bespoke licensing regime for virtual asset service providers. In February, Abu Dhabi kicked off a $2 billion initiative to support Web3 projects. Among other approvals, last month the center granted a license to virtual asset platform M2. Crypto exchange Rain received a license in July.  ""The harmony of traditional and new-age finance in Abu Dhabi with an international leading digital asset firm such as Zodia Markets that is backed by the well-established Standard Chartered will contribute to further enhancing the attractiveness of ADGM as a preferred destination for global entities,” said Salem Mohammed Al Darei, CEO of ADGM Authority.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has faced tumultuous weeks, with its price bouncing off the $1,626 support level, giving bulls a glimmer of hope. In a bid to regain lost ground, Ethereum needs to engineer a bullish breakout from the overhead trendline, aiming to potentially push its price back up to $2,020. Related Reading: Ethereum Bears Gain Upper Hand With Escalating Sell-Off: Impact On ETH Price ETH Bullish Breakout Looms, But Challenges Persist Over the past few weeks, Ethereum has witnessed multiple rebounds from the support trendline, thwarting sellers’ attempts to instigate a significant correction. The current ETH price hovers around $1,629, showing modest 24-hour gains of 0.5% but a seven-day dip of 4.9%. According to recent price analysis, if buyers maintain their pressure and the support trendline remains resilient, Ethereum could witness a 5-6% surge. Such a surge could challenge the persistent descending trendline that has dominated the ongoing corrective phase, and breaking past this resistance is crucial for a more pronounced recovery. ETH market cap currently at $195 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Ethereum’s Dwindling On-Chain Activity Raises Concerns While Ethereum’s price struggles, there has been a noticeable decline in transaction volume and overall activity on the Ethereum blockchain. Recent data shows that transaction volume has hit a nine-month low, accompanied by daily transaction fees reaching an eight-month low. This trend has sparked concerns within the crypto community, with a growing consensus that users are losing interest in the Ethereum blockchain and possibly exploring alternatives. Around mid-April, there was a significant shift in investor sentiment towards Ethereum, which was then trading at approximately $2,140 and had experienced substantial gains for the year. During the following four months, there was a consistent trend of large-scale selling by Ethereum “whales,” individuals holding between 10 and 10,000 ETH in their crypto wallets. These whales are often regarded as informed and influential players in the cryptocurrency market. One notable development that has raised eyebrows is the actions of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Observers have noted that Buterin has been transferring substantial amounts of Ethereum from his public wallets to other cryptocurrency wallets over the past month. Source: The Motley Fool Related Reading: Pepe Coin September Challenge: Can It Reach $0.000001 Again? The approximate sum of $6 million worth of Ethereum being moved has led some to view this as a potential red flag. Comparable to corporate insiders selling their shares when anticipating a price decline, Buterin’s actions have added to the uncertainty surrounding Ethereum’s future trajectory. With investors cautiously optimistic about a potential price rally, Ethereum must overcome significant challenges, including breaking past key resistance levels and reigniting user interest in its blockchain. All eyes remain on Ethereum’s next moves, as well as Buterin’s, along with crypto enthusiasts bracing for what the future holds for this influential digital asset.

Blockchain technology, the infrastructure that underpins crypto, has become more widely accepted by institutions thanks to crypto becoming more mainstream. Plus, apex banks of several countries, including Russia, started exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDC) as their answer to digital assets. Russia has been conducting a pilot for its digital ruble with banks.  Central banks, however, have been worried that a CBDC would cause problems for the banking world.  According to The European Money and Finance Forum, a one tier CBDC system that goes directly to depositors with no limits could result in “large transfers from commercial banks,"" increasing financial stability risks.  Currently, the central bank of Russia has not made it possible to get a loan in digital rubles, but Askakov believes this will change ""because it will be faster and, perhaps, more efficient."" If that happens, banks will not be needed at all, Askakov added.  “Decisions will be made by a robot - a person is not needed there. Perhaps a bank is not needed as an institution since the digital ruble will be very much technologized,” Askakov concluded.

42409732,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOeMv,1693993320,Bitcoin Set to Form Death Cross as Dollar Index Teases Golden Crossover,"Bitcoin's daily chart is set to show a so-called death cross, a major bearish technical pattern, for the first time since January 2022.  Past data show the death cross is not reliable as a standalone indicator.  Strengthening U.S. dollar and macro developments suggest tough times ahead for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  The bitcoin (BTC) price seems set on doing the opposite of whatever the dollar index (DXY) does.  The leading cryptocurrency's 50-day simple moving average is on track to drop below its 200-day SMA, confirming a so-called death cross, the first since January 2022. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major world currencies, looks set to confirm the opposite – a golden cross.  Bitcoin's death cross, likely to happen in the next few days, indicates that short-term price momentum is underperforming the long term, with the potential to evolve into a bearish trend. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, is also on the verge of flashing a death cross.  ""On the Bitcoin chart, such a pattern [death cross] could form next week,"" AlexKuptsikevich, the senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email on Monday. ""Such a signal suggests a further decline, emphasizing the bearish trend here.""  Still, history shows that a bitcoin death cross is unreliable as a standalone indicator.  The cryptocurrency has seen nine death crosses in the past, of which only two led to negative returns over three-, six- and 12-month timeframes. Only five times out of nine was bitcoin trading lower a year after the death cross.  The death cross looks set to happen just as the dollar index appears on pace to chalk up a golden crossover amid a worsening macroeconomic outlook for risk assets.  The DXY's 50-day SMA could top the 200-day SMA in the coming weeks. A golden crossover is widely taken to represent the beginning of a bull run.  Bitcoin and other risk assets, like technology stocks, are usually inversely correlated with the dollar index. The index has risen 5.3% to 104.90 since mid-July, hitting the highest since March 15, according to charting platform TradingView. Bitcoin declined 19% in the same period.  According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the U.S. dollar is the global reserve currency, accounting for most global trade, non-bank borrowing and international debt. That means a rally in the U.S. dollar causes financial tightening worldwide, putting downward pressure on risk assets.  ""The FX market has come under the spell of higher energy prices. U.S. energy independence and its net exporter status leave the dollar well-positioned for higher energy prices. It would seem the only real threat to the dollar in the near term would be some dramatic re-assessment of growth prospects,"" analysts at ING said in a note to clients on Tuesday, explaining the dollar's rise.  According to ING, with the U.S. economy chugging along quite well, markets are beginning to question expectations for rapid fire rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) next year. Hopes for a so-called dovish Fed pivot partly aided bitcoin's recovery from 2022's lows. The Fed has raised rates by over 500 basis points since March last year.  ING said that the new-found wisdom about low chance of quick rate cuts means the path of least resistance for longer duration U.S. Treasury yields is higher. In other words, the yield curve may see what's known as a bear steepening (de-inversion), which has historically marked major tops in risk assets.  ""I’m finally turning more constructive on crypto (yes, I see the prices), but I fear we must first get through a tricky inflection point on the macro side,"" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said in an email. ""The risk is a serious flush out of longer-dated yields and growth assets causing temporary re-coupling crypto as the new sock puppet proxy for quant traders.""  ""I’m pretty convinced the curve steepening train is leaving the station; the question is (a) the energy behind the move and (b) whether it’s on a bull or bear steepening track. Unfortunately, I’m leaning towards the latter – hope I’m wrong,"" Solot said.

42409716,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOdW1,1693991541,Anoma Foundation Plans to Launch Privacy-Focused Namada Blockchain,"KOREA BLOCKCHAIN WEEK, SEOUL — Blockchain non-profit Anoma Foundation today said it plans to create a standalone privacy-focused blockchain Namada that would support private transactions and features for any existing applications or networks.  Namada co-founder Awa Sun Yin revealed the plans at the Korea Blockchain Week (KBW) in Seoul, attended by CoinDesk. Namada would join the increasingly competitive and crowded ranks of over 50 other blockchains but differs with its privacy-focused approach.  Namada is a blockchain protocol with a focus on privacy. It uses a technology called zero-knowledge cryptography that allows users to transfer fungible or non-fungible assets from Ethereum or Cosmos networks without revealing their addresses or other on-chain footprints.  The protocol lets developers or users attach its privacy features to any existing assets, decentralized applications, and or even entire blockchain networks—without requiring alterations to their existing codebase.  “The lack of privacy in crypto is becoming an existentially threatening centralization point,” said Awa Sun Yin, co-founder of Namada, during a KBW panel. “In recent years, we’ve seen large improvements in cryptography, combined with a more mature and growing multichain landscape – making it possible to make the best privacy accessible for any user.""  “At this point, making privacy practical for anyone in crypto is no longer rocket science – it’s a matter of prioritization,” Awa added.  The Namada mainnet launch is scheduled for Q4 this year, representatives told CoinDesk in a follow-up message.  UPDATE (Sept. 14, 05:35 UTC): Corrects to say Namada is a standalone blockchain and not a protocol.

The popular meme token has been under sustained selling pressure, leading to a significant crack in a critical support level. Despite the recent launch of Shibarium, a blockchain platform aimed at enhancing the SHIB ecosystem, the bearish sentiment seems to have a firm grip on the token’s price chart, raising concerns about the long-term outlook. The crack in SHIB’s armor became evident as it breached the crucial $0.00000807 support level, resulting in a 7.3% decline in its price over the past seven days. Currently, SHIB is trading at $0.00000764, as reported by CoinGecko, with a modest 1.5% gain in the last 24 hours. However, these numbers only tell part of the story. Related Reading: Ethereum Bears Gain Upper Hand With Escalating Sell-Off: Impact On ETH Price Shiba Inu’s Bearish Indicators Abound A deeper dive into the technical indicators as revealed in a recent report reveals a grim picture for SHIB. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has seen a substantial decline, resting at the zero mark as of press time. This signifies a lack of buying pressure and strong capital outflows. Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains in a downtrend, hovering just above the oversold zone, highlighting the absence of demand for SHIB. SHIB market cap currently at $4.5 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com Intriguingly, the report also points out that the levels at which bears could potentially profit might serve as a price reversal zone for bulls, drawing parallels with price action observed in early June. However, the 24-hour liquidation data from Coinglass suggests a muted possibility of a bullish uptick in the near future. Shiba Inu: The Indian Connection Despite the challenging times for SHIB, it continues to make waves on WazirX, one of India’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges. According to a recent tweet from the exchange, SHIB held its ground among the top three most traded digital currencies in August, alongside giants like Bitcoin and XRP.

42409723,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcOdtA,1693987578,SOMA Finance to Issue the First Retail Compliant Digital Security,"SOMA Finance, a joint venture between MANTRA and Tritaurian Capital, is planning to offer the first legally issued and compliantly structured digital security to global and U.S. retail investors later this month, the company said in a statement Wednesday.  The company plans to sell up to $5 million in tokens in one or more tranches, with the first tranche priced at $2.50 per token. The token also gives holders benefits, including the right to a dividend of up to 10% of SOMA’s profits. It plans to issue the SOMA token at the end of this month, or by early October.  The SOMA token is also the first regulation crowdfunding (Reg CF) issuance on the SOMA.finance platform, the firm said. SOMA.finance is a multiasset decentralized exchange (DEX) and issuance platform for tokenized equities, digital assets and non-fungible-tokens (NFTs).  A criticism often leveled at the cryptocurrency industry is that crypto tokens don’t represent a financial claim on the equity or debt of the issuer. In the event of bankruptcy or fraud, investors are often left holding tokens that are worthless with little or no recourse to get their money back.  What's unique about the SOMA token is that it will actually represent a financial interest in SOMA at a corporate level, as the token will be a non-cumulative, participating preferred stock of SOMA.finance, the company said.  “We have been working quietly but diligently to develop the necessary technology to launch a revolutionary decentralized marketplace for digital assets, compliant digital securities, and NFTs while liaising with regulators to provide a highly regulated decentralized financial platform,” said William B. Heyn, co-founder and co-CEO, SOMA.finance and CEO of Tritaurian Capital.""  Tritaurian Capital is a registered broker-dealer and member of the Financial Industry Reporting Authority (FINRA) and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). It is the first non-alternative trading system (ATS) broker-dealer to be approved for a license to sell digital private placement securities using blockchain technology.

17182250,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550202,1693985422,"Crypto Alert: Solana, Aptos, APE And More Token Unlocks Coming This September","September is gearing up to be a pivotal month in the crypto space, with a series of substantial token unlocks for Solana, ApeCoin, Worldcoin, Optimism, dYdX and Aptos on the horizon. Popular crypto voices, @TheDeFinvestor and @wacy_time1, have taken to Twitter to provide insights, speculations, and analyses on these impending events. Here’s a consolidated look at their perspectives. ApeCoin (APE) Set to witness one of the most significant unlocks this month, APE will release $54.8 million, which represents 11% of its circulating supply, on Sept. 17. Both influencers highlighted the magnitude of this event. @TheDeFinvestor pointed out that most of the unlocked tokens would go to insiders, specifically launch contributors. Drawing from history, the last time a large amount of APE tokens entered circulation, the price experienced a sharp dip. @wacy_time1 mentioned the potential risks of shorting APE, especially given its current position. Since the beginning of the year, the APE is in a steep downtrend which saw price decline by 80%. Worldcoin (WLD) WLD is set for a daily unlock of $3.38 million. @TheDeFinvestor emphasized that in a year, the circulating supply of WLD would be three times its current amount.The token’s value has reportedly decreased by almost 50% since its launch. Despite this downtrend, both influencers cautioned against shorting it due to its large VC backers and potential price manipulations. Related Reading: VISA’s Stablecoin Payments On Solana Propel SOL To 5% Gain, Bulls Eye Price Breakout Solana (SOL) Solana is set for an unlock of $10.3 million from staking on September 7. @wacy_time1 provided an analysis suggesting that a majority of the 2756 stakers receiving 531,574 SOL might not immediately sell. The influencer believes that any price drop could be an accumulation opportunity, emphasizing the potential of Solana. Remarkably, just yesterday, Solana announced that payments giant Visa is scaling their USDC settlement pilot to include the Solana blockchain, enabling enterprise-grade throughput at virtually no cost for Visa issuers and merchant acquirers on Solana. The SOL price reacted with a 5% surge but couldn’t take out the 50% Fibonacci retracement level on the 1-day. As long as this mark is not surpassed on a daily closing basis, further upside potential seems ruled out. Optimism (OP) OP will unlock $32.3M, or 3.03% of its circulating supply, on Sept. 30. These tokens are designated for core contributors and investors. @TheDeFinvestor mentioned that these groups are typically the ones most likely to sell. However, @wacy_time1 expressed a more optimistic view, suggesting that the price might not react negatively. The influencer emphasized the potential of Optimism following the success of Coinbase’s Base and hinted at accumulation opportunities if any negative price reaction occurs. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: 2023, 2024, 2025 and Beyond dYdX On Sept. 26, $13.7 million, about 3.8% of the dYdX circulating supply, will be unlocked. These tokens are allocated to the community treasury, liquidity provider rewards, and trading rewards. @TheDeFinvestor highlighted the mid-long term selling pressure these unlocks might introduce, while @wacy_time1 did not express significant concerns regarding this token’s unlock. Aptos (APT) A standard linear unlock of $25 million is scheduled for APT on September 12. @wacy_time1 shared that he doesn’t anticipate a significant price reaction and might consider buying APT for speculative purposes if it drops below $3. In light of these impending unlocks, the crypto community is advised to stay informed and exercise caution. The events of September are poised to offer both challenges and opportunities for crypto investors.

17165527,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550182,1693962010,"The Great Bitcoin Gap: Will BTC Plummet To Fill The Void At $19,500?","Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency in the market, continues to exhibit a stagnant price movement. However, a notable development has emerged as BTC struggles to sustain consolidation above the critical $26,000 threshold. This could potentially present challenges for the cryptocurrency’s performance. Currently trading at $25,700, Bitcoin is on the cusp of a significant breakout. This breakout can exert pressure on short positions and liquidity pools positioned above or to fill the gaps on lower levels of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). What’s more concerning is that these gaps are located near what many experts believe to be the bottom of the Bitcoin bear market. Bitcoin Double Top Formation And Implications For Price Renowned crypto analyst Rekt Capital has recently shared valuable insights on Bitcoin’s price action and charts, shedding light on the likelihood of the cryptocurrency filling the CME gap at $19,500 and $20,500. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: 2023, 2024, 2025 and Beyond In a YouTube video uploaded on September 5, Rekt Capital emphasizes the significance of BTC’s weekly chart in understanding its recent movements. According to Rekt Capital’s analysis, Bitcoin’s weekly chart reveals a double top formation at $30,800, a pattern historically followed by symmetrical downside movements. Drawing from this observation, Rekt Capital suggests that the current price action could potentially open the doors to filling the CME gap at $19,500 in the short term. Another factor highlighted by Rekt Capital is the importance of the $26,000 support level, which Bitcoin is currently losing. The analyst suggests this loss could further extend BTC’s downside price action, bringing it closer to the CME gap. Adding to the concern, Rekt Capital points out a bearish fractal published on August 30, in which Bitcoin’s weekly chart indicates a lower high, signaling a continuation of the downtrend. In the event of a revisit to the sub $20,000 level, Rekt Capital notes the possibility of a head and shoulders pattern forming on BTC’s weekly chart. While the right shoulder of the pattern is yet to be completed, the overall structures indicate that the pattern could eventually be fulfilled. Rekt Capital’s analysis underscores the significance of BTC’s current price action and charts, highlighting potential scenarios such as filling the lower CME gap and navigating the obstacle presented by the already filled gap at $28,000. The outcome of these scenarios for the dominant cryptocurrency in the market is yet to be determined. However, what is evident is the prevailing bearish sentiment that has gripped the Bitcoin market, instilling apprehension among investors.

17162789,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550151,1693958417,Defying The Crypto Crash: Liquid Staking’s $20 Billion Rise Amid Market Uncertainty,"The crypto market has witnessed several fluctuations, but specific sectors’ resilience within this domain remains attractive. Recently, despite a noticeable dip in the broader crypto market, one area seems poised to touch its peak, demonstrating the potential and adaptability within the crypto ecosystem, per a report. Liquid staking, a sector that facilitates rewards for token pledges supporting blockchain operations, shows signs of resurgence. This re-emergence occurs despite an overarching downturn in crypto assets. Related Reading: Lido (LDO) Price Inks Gains Alongside TVL Rise – What Traders Should Expect Recovery Amid Crypto Crisis According to Bloomberg, citing data from DefiLlama, there is a roughly 292% surge in assets secured in liquid staking services, reaching a monumental $20 billion from a low in June 2022. This ascent is all the more significant considering the broader crypto slump during that period. Bloomberg noted a recovery in liquid staking’s position as “the titan of decentralized finance (DeFi).” Thanks to blockchain-based automated software, this crypto framework enables individuals to trade, borrow, and lend without intermediaries. Notably, once the crown jewel of DeFi applications, liquid staking has overtaken lending. Protocols specialized in liquid staking, such as Lido and Rocket Pool, witnessed their zenith in April of the previous year. They amassed assets slightly exceeding $21 billion. However, this momentum was disrupted by the destabilization of TerraUSD, leading to a massive $2 trillion setback in the crypto market. Despite the gloomy overtones in the crypto sector, where major tokens and a majority of DeFi services are yet to recover from the blows of 2021 and 2022, liquid staking stands out, showcasing a comeback, as seen in the chart below. Global Regulatory Stance On Staking Liquid staking plays a pivotal role, especially in the Ethereum blockchain. It offers a mechanism where users can stake their tokens and, in return, receive a liquid token representing their staked amount. This process allows users to participate in securing the network while maintaining liquidity. Simply put, they can earn staking rewards without locking up their assets, ensuring flexibility and maximizing potential gains. Kunal Goel, a research analyst at Messari, parallels these services to “the on-chain equivalent of government bonds.” The analyst elaborates that while these aren’t devoid of risks, they exude a comparatively lower risk profile and, thus far, have remained untainted by hacks or exploits. This resurgence in liquid staking doesn’t go unnoticed and has been juxtaposed with regulatory decisions concerning crypto globally. The US, for instance, has intensified its regulatory lens on the crypto sector, especially on staking products.

Such measures prompted key players like Kraken and Bitstamp to halt their regional staking products. Richard Galvin, co-founder at DACM, noted: The regulatory crackdown around staking products offered by centralized exchanges has definitely helped liquid staking.
