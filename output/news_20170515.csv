42379480,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX885Xz,1494886583,"Healthy Correction? Bitcoin Prices Retreat to $1,700","Bitcoin prices suffered what analysts largely called a correction today, falling nearly $100 to a low of roughly $1,650, almost 7% below the opening price.  The price of bitcoin suffered this fallback after nearly doubling in less than two months, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Amid the strong interest from investors, bitcoin prices reached an all-time high of $1,848.75 on 11th May, but since then, they've fallen more than 10%.  In response, several analysts weighed in on this decline, though most said it was to be expected given the recent run of gains.  ""The price is pulling back after spectacular rises,"" said Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of exchange information service CryptoCompare. ""A correction is in play.""  While bitcoin's price has retreated somewhat, more than one analyst described this as simply being a ""healthy"" correction.  ""Prices can't keep going up and not correct,"" said Harry Yeh, managing partner of Binary Financial. Petar Zivkovski, COO of Whaleclub, offered similar sentiment, calling the activity a ""healthy correction"" in response to an upswell of recent hype.  However, Zivkovski added that cryptocurrencies could face further declines.  ""If it does, more downside is to be expected as traders rush to take profit on long positions they've held since the start of the bull run,"" he commented.  Other analysts stated that the recent pullback in bitcoin prices was nothing out of the ordinary. Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, described it as ""standard behavior"" after the huge gains seen lately.  Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, provided similar input.  ""It's like asking why it's raining when it's been dry for weeks. It's a small pullback, going up nonstop for weeks just wouldn't be natural,"" he said.  Eliosoff projected that real alarm prices would be in the $1,200 to $1,000 range, concluding that unless we have a ""real drop"" like that, no explanation is required.

According to local news service E24, Skandiabanken – a digital bank owned by savings and investments provider Skandia – will let users connect their accounts with a Coinbase one, allowing them to view their cryptocurrency balances and values.  It’s a launch that closely mirrors one launched by US financial services firm USAA (which largely caters to the armed services market) in 2015 to a select group of clients. A year later, USAA rolled it out to all account holders.  In translated statements, representatives for Skandiabanken – claimed to be the largest bank of its kind in the region – said the launch represents a shifting stance toward digital currencies.

42379450,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX882o9,1494868808,Buy a Green Card With Bitcoin? US Officials Weigh Impact on EB-5,"US immigration services are actively weighing the question of whether bitcoin can be used to pay for obligations tied to a controversial visa program.  The context: One avenue for acquiring a green card or permanent residency in the US is through the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa Program. This initiative was started in the 1990s as a way to attract overseas investor capital to projects in ostensibly needy areas.  Yet the EB-5 program has come under fire in recent months amid accusations that it has become a vehicle for wealthy investors to effectively buy their way into the US and invest in projects – namely, luxury real estate – that are completely unrelated to the program's intended goal. The program has even been targeted by members of Congress for elimination given the criticism.  Family members of Trump administrator advisor Jared Kushner, who is President Donald Trump's son-in-law, sparked controversy earlier this month after appearing to encourage Chinese citizens to invest in their developments via the EB-5 program – and curry favor with Trump in the process.  The bitcoin connection: Recent statements from the head of the Immigrant Investor Visa Program office, Lori MacKenzie, suggest that investors may, in fact, be able to pay their obligations under the EB-5 guidelines using bitcoin.  MacKenzie, who spoke on 3rd March during an EB-5 event in Washington, DC, said that Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) is ""considering issues involving virtual currency such as bitcoin"" related to ""the use of bitcoin to transfer investment funds to the new commercial enterprise"".  She went on to say:  ""USCIS cannot provide blanket assurances regarding any particular form of transfer, but we will continue to evaluate evidence provided by petitioners to determine whether the relevant statutory and regulatory requirements have been met, including evidence that the funds invested belong to the petitioner, and were acquired, directly and indirectly, by lawful means.""  Bottom line: So, what does this mean?  For starters, blockchain is a topic that is on the US government's radar, but whether it will result in a concrete policy shift or statement remains to be seen. A representative for CIS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Indeed, it's a subject – at least somewhat – that has come in the past, led by questions of whether income derived from bitcoin-related activities can be used to satisfy the EB-5 requirements. The consensus appears to be that the government shouldn't take issue with it, though as several experts remarked last year, the source of the funds would be a paramount issue.  Then again, this could all be rendered moot should the EB-5 be abolished. At the same time, it's not clear whether the Trump administration will move to axe the program.

42379446,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX882j7,1494862188,European Stability Mechanism Floats Possible Blockchain Integration,"Will the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) someday run on blockchain?  This was a hypothetical recently offered by Kalin Anev Janse, the secretary-general of the ESM – a eurozone-wide organization established in 2012 with the stated goal of shoring up the finances of troubled member-states.  The ESM emerged from the aftermath of the late-2000s financial panic, when a growing number of eurozone countries were facing significant financial pressures. To date, the ESM has loaned out more than €100bn to states including Cyprus and Greece, out of a total capacity of €500bn.  Yet according to Janse, who spoke during a World Bank forum on 25th April, the ESM as it exists today could benefit from a technology boost – and here's where blockchain comes in.  What he said: During his speech, Janse brought up the concept of a ""European public sector issuance platform"", through which debt – say, created by the ESM – could be marketed and sold more effectively.  He suggested ""a fintech solution, driven by the public sector"" as a way to power the platform.  Janse went on to say:  ""This point is particularly interesting for the ESM because a more integrated market would by its nature also be more stable. And as our name indicates, ensuring the financial stability of the euro area stable is our core mission. One could even think of using new technologies, like blockchain to set up the new issuance platform.""  What this means: For now, it's unlikely that the ESM leadership is considering a wholesale integration or replacement powered by blockchain. But the comments are telling, given that Janse is one of the organization's senior officials.  It's certainly an area that the European Union's top securities watchdog, ESMA, may take an interest in. Should the ESM seriously consider using the tech to issue new kinds of digital securities, the regulator could rethink its recent decision to pass – for now – on new rules for blockchain.

42379447,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX882hr,1494855681,'Big Four' Irish Banks Join Blockchain Payments Pilot,"Two of Ireland's 'Big Four' banks are taking part in a blockchain payments trial organized by professional services firm Deloitte.  According to The Irish Times, Ulster Bank is among several institutions participating. Along with Ulster Bank, AIB and Permanent TSB are testing the tech for use as a domestic payment rail. Those involved have framed the test as an R&D effort, and there's no indication as of yet whether it could lead to any kind of production launch.  The pilot is being based on a solution previously developed by Royal Bank of Scotland (of which Ulster Bank is a subsidiary). RBS has detailed some of its work with blockchain in the past, highlighting an in-house cryptocurrency in late 2015.  It was developments at RBS, a representative for Ulster Bank told the Times, that led to the new initiative.  ""When we saw that RBS had that capability, we decided to use the platform in the Republic. We looked at how we could prove it at an industry level and looked at doing collaboration at an industry level,"" Ciarán Coyle, Ulster Bank’s chief admin officer, explained.  In recent months, Ireland has played home to a number of blockchain projects among financial firms in the country. Deloitte itself opened a research lab dedicated to the tech in January.

42379448,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX882fL,1494853206,"$1,700? Bitcoin's Price is Up Even as its Tech Progress Stalls","""Honey badger don't give a shit.""  Sometimes referred to as the 'honey badger of money' (after a famous viral video), bitcoin enthusiasts may find this comparison particularly apt of late. Since the beginning of the year, the network's value has nearly doubled – even while the community continues to be mired in debate.  Market observers so far have offered a wide range of reasons for this uptick, though not all of them are good, with increasing prices causing concerns that the industry as a whole is entering a speculative bubble.  Supply and demand  Still, not everyone believes the boost is due to speculation.  Redwood City Ventures founder Sean Walsh, for example, sent CoinDesk a bullet-pointed email summarizing the various global developments that could be contributing to the bitcoin price surge. He believes developments in South Korea, Japan, Russia and China have all contributed.  The price surge, according to Walsh, is simply supply and demand.  ""Bitcoin is dramatically more scarce than most people realize, especially in the context of its total addressable market of nearly 3 billion internet-connected adults,"" he continued.  Walsh framed the situation simply as one where the cryptocurrency is seeing increased demand, which looks to only increase in the future:  ""Once the global race to own bitcoin commences, the tiny supply of new bitcoins (just 54,000 new coins per month) will be completely overrun by demand,"" he said, adding:  “There just aren't anywhere near enough coins to go around, and pre-existing holders will grasp ever more tightly into this surging market, as perennially dictated by human nature.”  Tensions subsiding  Still, to those following day-to-day technical developments, it might seem odd that the digital currency's price has seen such an upswing amid its scaling debate and a stalled upgrade known as SegWit.  Kristov Atlas, a security engineer at wallet and data firm Blockchain, for example, wasn't able to find technical reasons for the uptick in demand.  He told CoinDesk  ""I don't see how the price increase could relate to tech changes; no big changes in long term projects like Lightning lately, and the block size stalemate is still status quo.""  ""[It] must be something outside bitcoin that investors have changed their minds about,"" he suggested.  While developers, admittedly, might not be experts on economic market conditions, those that have been in the industry for a while are perhaps more aware of how technical developments could contribute to bitcoin’s price.  When asked, some argued the state of the technology could have something to do with the recent increase, though, perhaps in surprising way.  For example, bitcoin’s block size debate took a weird turn a couple of months ago, when discussions about the possibility of forking bitcoin into two networks reappeared. This time around, some miners and developers suggested the idea of destroying the chain that didn't follow along with the majority of hashing power.  This has yet to happen, though, and worries about such an event happening have since died down. Some wonder if this could have given the price boost.  ""I think part of the rally is due to increased confidence that the risk of a contentious hard fork has all but evaporated,"" Reddit moderator BashCo said.  Yet some expect to see a 'correction', where the price dips to a more reasonable place.  The emotion factor  The idea that raised tensions contribute to price swings fits with bitcoin developer and Nakamoto Institute director of research, Daniel Krawisz's view that the price has more to do with emotions.  ""The price of bitcoin never makes sense and it doesn’t have very much to do with the tech,"" he said. ""It’s about emotion. It’s about greed.""  Krawisz also sees the price more aligned with bitcoin's original value proposition of giving users more control, rather than more granular tech additions or debates.  “It’s not the new features of bitcoin that matter. What matters are the old features. People keep moving into bitcoin because it's a better alternative than their own national currency,” he said, adding:  ""Bitcoin doesn't really need new features, because it's already better.""  Though, perhaps echoing other developer's sentiments about a reduction in fear, Krawisz went on to argue that the increase in demand probably has to do with bitcoin's apparent stability, since it’s been around for a long time compared with many cryptocurrencies.  ""It's the same reason that people always get into bitcoin now as ever,"" he concluded.

42379473,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX882pP,1494849613,Meet the German Baron Who Thinks Blockchain Will Beat the Middlemen,"The former head of Germany's armed forces is now helping to bring blockchain tech to some of the world's largest financial institutions.  An early advisor to distributed financial technology firm Ripple, not to mention a bonafide German baron, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg today plays a key role in enabling the heavily funded startup to make inroads in the banking sector. But as co-founder of consultancy Spitzberg Partners, he is setting his sights beyond finance.  Over the course of his time at both the Ministry of Defense and Minister of Economics & Technology, zu Guttenberg built up an extensive network of global politicians, technologists and bankers.  Long rumored to be a potential candidate to replace his former boss, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, zu Guttenberg last month revealed exclusively to CoinDesk that his firm had partnered with the State of Delaware's blockchain initiative to help bring a global tech cohort to the tiny US state.  Now, he says his firm has taken on a ""significant portion"" of blockchain companies as clients and is consolidating those resources to focus on a concerted push to bring the technology to the world.  At Spitzberg’s New York City headquarters, zu Guttenberg explained how the work he's conducting in Delaware, with Ripple and with other blockchain firms, is part of a larger plan.  Zu Guttenberg told CoinDesk:  ""I always tell the dreamers in the bitcoin community and the blockchain community, don't expect that this will happen at one point and everyone is enlightened. It will be a bumpy process.""  Seeking disruptors  Zu Guttenberg founded New York City-based Spitzerg Partners in August 2013 in reaction to requests he said he received from leaders in the US tech sector for advice on navigating complicated geopolitical issues.  After commissioning a study on the leading causes of failed companies, he narrowed the reasons to inadequate geopolitical and cross-cultural knowledge, as well as an inability to properly understand the regulatory implications of both.  ""I was interested in the fact that they were burning billions [of dollars] in their attempt to roll out by entirely misunderstanding a few core elements,"" he said.  Currently, Spitzerg focuses on revenue generating firms in four main industries – Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, big data analytics and blockchain – with a rapidly growing cohort of blockchain startups, though the co-founder didn't share the exact number.  Zu Guttenberg defines his typical client as a company that could become the subject of either a ""fiercely led political debate, a harsh counter-reaction by old industry or a combination of both.""  He added:  ""And there are many.""  The first pebble  Zu Guttenberg first caught the blockchain bug in 2012 at a conference where he met the co-founder of San Francisco-based Ripple, Chris Larsen and New York-based Digital Currency Group founder and CEO, Barry Silbert.  Following a conversation with the two, zu Guttenberg said his interest was piqued, mostly about the idea of a shared ledger with the power to let counterparties do business without a middleman.  He bought about $30 worth of bitcoin and began a dialogue with Larsen that culminated in July 2014 when he formally joined Ripple's advisory board.  At the time, he had been working on a series of unpublished articles about international capital flows and the history of correspondent banking, and discussed the role that Ripple's cryptocurrency, XRP, could potentially play in freeing up dormant money in banks around the world.  With XRP in the midst of an explosive growth cycle that has seen it become the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, zu Guttenberg and his team have continued to work behind the scenes to help build out Ripple’s network.  Most recently, Ripple has added 10 new financial firms to its network, including MUFG in Japan, BBVA in Spain and SEB in Sweden, and has completed a pilot with 47 global banks.  Though Ripple has set legacy financial technology firm Swift square in its sights, zu Guttenberg said that Ripple’s secret to widespread adoption has been recognizing when to play nice with other legacy platforms.  ""Many of these players, although they are sitting on already rotten instruments or structures, will be in place, and in power,"" he said. ""[They will be] dramatically empowered by political circles for quite a while and they're still extremely influential.""  Global vision  To help modernize those legacy systems, though, Ripple will require more than just a willingness to play nice with banks. Government support is crucial.  Zu Guttenberg cited smaller nations such as Estonia and Singapore, and jurisdictions including the Zug region of Switzerland and Delaware, as fundamental testing grounds for the types of legislation that might one day underpin a new financial infrastructure.  Specifically, he said the ""charm"" of Delaware's increasing openness to blockchain should serve as a template for jurisdictions around the world.  Most recently, Delaware state senators introduced a bill that would explicitly name blockchain as a recognized technology to support the owning and trading of corporate stocks.  ""Why don't we translate the Delaware experience to another state or city in Germany?"" zu Guttenberg asked. ""Why don’t we try to do the same in the Middle East? Why don't we try to do the same in Latin America somewhere?""  The ex-minister added that he's already had conversations with his former boss, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in which she expressed a ""general"" interest in the technology.  ""The question is, will every department be adopted, or will it just be two or three departments doing it?"" he said.  While he said the topic of how blockchain is being adopted by governments comes up organically in his meetings with leaders around the world, zu Guttenberg argued that the push to bring blockchain into widespread adoption will require a more concerted effort.  ""People [need to] deliver the experiences from these test runs to other governments, to old industry and back to the blockchain industry.""  He concluded:  ""That doesn't happen by itself and we're delighted to be at that intersection.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.

42379456,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX882qf,1494844207,Bank of Japan Fintech Head: Don't Expect Central Banks to Lead DLT,"While central banks around the world are taking an active interest in blockchain and digital ledger technology (DLT), we shouldn't expect the institutions that manage money supplies to lead their development.  That was one takeaway from a new conversation with Bank of Japan deputy director general Yuko Kawai, head of the central bank's fintech center. In an exclusive interview, Kawai discussed how blockchain is emerging as one of the ""hottest topics"" among central banks, and how her own institution is working to get up to speed on the technology.  Speaking on whether central banks should play a role in developing new platforms and technologies, she reported that her institution and its peers are looking to the private sector to provide the leading area of activity.  Kawai told CoinDesk:  ""We believe technologies should be developed in the private sector. Talking about a global platform or the joint research between the public and private sectors, I don't think we're at that stage.""  Kawai pointed to the Japanese market as one where private institutions are already leading the charge, citing a consortium led by the Japan Exchange Group (JPX) as the epicenter of local research and strategy. JPX announced in March that it had 26 members – including Mizuho Bank, Nomura Holdings and Bank of Japan – involved in its work.  As for work with other central banks, however, Bank of Japan has gone public with one formal partnership, unveiled with the European Central Bank earlier this year.  The two organizations are now working on tests that explore how distributed ledgers could be applied to market infrastructure. As explained by the ECB's Dirk Bullmann in an interview last week, the ideas is that banks would be able to prioritize how payments are cleared.  ""We are trying to replicate the interbank payment system and trying to apply the blockchain in a closed system,"" Kawai affirmed.  Still, despite her organization's interest in the area, like other central banks, the Bank of Japan still believes it's too early to use the technology in its financial market infrastructure. Despite its strong rhetoric, the Bank of England recently pulled back on its blockchain work, opting for a 'DLT-compatible' infrastructure for its new settlement system.  ""I don't think we can say that blockchain technologies or other technologies are mature enough to be applied to the real world,"" Kawai continued.  Aside from its study with the ECB, Bank of Japan said it does not have any proof-of-concepts running related to the technology.  Coordination not consortiums  Another topic addressed was the possibility that, like the private sector, global central banks could take an interest in collaborating broadly on distributed ledger tech.  Here, Kawai sidestepped the idea there would be any formal collaboration akin to R3, the consortium of more than 80 global banks designed to focus on DLT applications. ""Coordination can mean anything. If you mean we are exchanging information, the answer is already yes,"" she said.  Kawai went on to address the idea of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), one she said ""almost all central banks"" are studying. The People's Bank of China, for instance, published a new opinion piece on CoinDesk last week in which it looked in depth into that idea.  Still, Kawai said that the organization sees this as more of a topic of intellectual interest than operational strategy.  ""Will we be issuing a digital currency any time soon? I don't think so, but we are researching it and trying not to be too ignorant about the technology,"" she said.  In this way, Kawai framed Bank of Japan's exploration of blockchain and distributed ledgers as part of the bank's responsibility. While not a market regulator – a job for the country's Financial Services Agency (FSA) – she described her department's role as a gateway of information to the wider organization.  Rising tide  Still, there's the question of whether Bank of Japan is truly moving at the pace of the market, given that the country is emerging as one of the most forward on the technology.  One key difference is that, despite early setbacks, Japan is now home to the dominant market for bitcoin trading, outpacing even the US dollar market, according to data provider CryptoCompare. Sensing an opportunity, private sector companies are beginning to move in.  Encouraged by the use of digital money and payment more broadly, companies including internet services provider GMO Internet and SBI Holdings are gearing up to launch bitcoin exchange offerings that would compete directly with domestic exchange startups including Quoine, Coincheck and BitFlyer.  However, Kawai said that the Bank of Japan shouldn't discourage private sector innovation relating to the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  ""We are very interested in cryptocurrencies and how they will work in a bank ecosystem. If bitcoin could become ever sizable enough to affect the traditional financial market, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies might have that potential in the future,"" Kawai explained.  She concluded:  ""If that age comes in the future, we can't be behind.""

42379458,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX882wx,1494842405,Government-Backed Firm to Launch Blockchain IDs in Luxembourg,"A major digital identity firm backed by the government of Luxembourg is building a new platform alongside US startup Cambridge Blockchain.  The initiative, unveiled today, sees the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based startup partnering with LuxTrust – a company formed in 2005 as part of a big push toward digital identity solutions within Luxembourg that began in the early 2000s.  The state of Luxembourg owns two-thirds of LuxTrust, with the remainder held by a consortium of banks and financial institutions that utilize its services.  That firm is now moving to integrate blockchain, setting the stage for at least some of its 500,000-strong subscriber base to utilize the tech in some capacity.  According to Cambridge Blockchain CEO Matthew Commons, the partnership grew out of initial conversations around digital identity, building on what he described as a shared perspective on some of the pain points in offering such services.  ""By combining LuxTrust's current certified services such as authentication, signature and document management with our innovative blockchain-based enterprise software, our collaboration will deliver the future of digital identity for Europe and beyond,"" he said.  The platform developed alongside LuxTrust will be rolled out over the coming months, in what Commons described as a kind of ""soft launch"". He pointed to data-centric regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation – due to come into force in mid-2018 – as a major motivating factor, a factor LuxTrust echoed in statements.  ""Working with Cambridge Blockchain allows us to augment the scope of identities, including any attributes, and will enable users to share personal data fully respecting the increasingly stringent European regulatory framework,"" said Pascal Rogiest, LuxTrust's CEO.  The move comes months after Cambridge Blockchain finished raising $2m in a funding round, drawing support from VC firms Partech Ventures and Digital Currency Group.

The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  What do we mean by 'blockchain regulation'?  It's something we hear governments, incumbents and startups say we need, but no one seems to be clear on what it involves. For example, this past week Russia's government announced that it will have blockchain regulation in place by 2019, though details were hard to come by.  Yet broad promises like that reveal a lack of understanding of what blockchain technology offers. While it's possible that the reports don't carry all the information, assuring regulation of an evolving technology within any time span is a vague promise that can't be kept.  An event at the European Parliament this week highlighted a different approach: a focus on discovery. Rather than start with what the technology must be stopped from doing, the idea seems to be to first figure out what it can do, help it develop and then work on how to protect the consumer.  Yet, even this approach has its drawbacks. First, regulators will have to decide what exactly it is that they're regulating. The underlying code? Or the uses?  Regulating software is like regulating a car. If it isn't used, it's not dangerous. Yet, once someone is behind the wheel, that can change. Rules exist to regulate intended behavior.  Also, car design requires certain security precautions. Drivers need to know that the brakes will work and that the engine won't blow up when ignited. True, hardware is not the same as software, but the premise that some guarantees of security are necessary still holds.  An argument can be made for letting the market decide. Just as car makers that don't take extra steps to ensure design integrity tend to go out of business fast, so could market rejection render shoddy blockchain craftsmanship irrelevant.  However, when distributed ledgers are used to transfer value (money, securities, titles, etc), waiting for the 'market to decide' could have systemic consequences. So, the security measures of the underlying technology will need to be regulated, according to its use.  Defining use  The problem is, we don't yet know what the uses will be.  The hundreds of pilots and proofs-of-concept currently in motion are but a tip of the iceberg when it comes to potential applications.  Second, the unusual schism (for a technology) of private vs public networks requires two different approaches. While it's possible to draft laws regarding the development of private blockchains, regulating public networks according to their uses is obviously a non-starter given the international, free-access nature of the distribution. Who would do the regulating?  It's not even possible to apply the jurisdictional laws of the domicile of the creator, since no one knows the founder of bitcoin's identity, let alone the location of his (or her) legal base.  However, the main public blockchains have been rigorously tested by the market, and have – to date, at least – proven to be resilient.  So, focus can shift to the applications built on top of public blockchains. Even here reach will be limited, as apps can be launched from anywhere, by anyone, in some cases with indeterminate jurisdiction.  In this case, regulators have no choice but to let the market decide.  Stamp of approval  This could highlight an evolving role for lawmakers: as a seal of confidence.  Regulated apps and use cases would imply a certain level of security, which the market will likely prefer. Even if more innovative opportunities arise in unregulated areas, competitors would soon emerge with the advantage of approval.  The EU appears to be following this path. Its innovation-first philosophy could end up supporting development from two angles: 1) encouraging the exploration of use cases to test impact and laws, and 2) giving entrepreneurs confidence that their 'approved' applications will be more trusted by their target markets.  This approach, combined with the EU's scope as regulators for a 28-country economic bloc, could not only encourage an ecosystem of thinkers and doers. It could also end up making Europe a prime destination for blockchain development, as businesses choose the continent for their domicile and as talent flocks to the area.  Hopefully, the economic boost would inspire other areas to adopt similar measures. Shedding defensive regulation in favor of a more supportive approach could change the perception businesses and citizens have of their government.  As MEP Eva Kaili said in this week’s event in the European Parliament:  ""Maybe this way we can regain some trust.""
