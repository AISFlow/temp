The miner has shifted its strategy to favor holding (HODLing) Bitcoin instead of selling, positioning itself well for the upcoming Halving event. At the same time, it is boosting production capacity and boasts better profitability margins compared to its peers, making it an undervalued investment opportunity. Investing in Bitcoin-related stocks also implies that someone must have the capacity to stomach volatility. CleanSpark’s ( CLSK ) stock has delivered a one-year performance of 27%, but at around $4.6 a share, it is still far below its July 13 high of $7.5. Now, as a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner, its shares are certainly impacted by the price of the cryptocurrency, but other factors also come into play such as finances, cost of production in an economic environment still marred by the lingering effects of high inflation while not forgetting the forthcoming Bitcoin halving event in April 2024. Data by YCharts By going through these factors, the aim of this thesis is to make a strong investment case for the miner and I also take this opportunity to highlight some of the risks. I start by deep-diving into the catalysts that are determining the current performance of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin's Price Determines Miner's Revenue It seems all green for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap as it broke through the $35K resistance level on November 1, last reached around mid-May 2022 as charted below. At that time, the main reason for its downfall was a super hawkish Federal Reserve, which had just embarked on a path to hiking interest rates at an unprecedented pace in recent memory. The situation is completely different today with rates already at a record of 5.5%, a level only exceeded in the early 2000s. Furthermore, the Chairman of the U.S Central Bank recently hinted that he could be done with raising implying that a continued pause could give further impetus to Bitcoin, in a reversal of what happened in 2022. Data by YCharts Coming back to 2022, another factor that weighed significantly on the performance of digital assets was the crash of cryptocurrency exchanges like FTX in November of that year whose founder Sam Bankman-Fried has just been convicted of fraud for allegedly stealing at least $10 billion from customers and investors. Learning from that event, the collapse of an exchange can be contagious to the whole ecosystem as investors desperately try to exit their positions, in turn causing liquidity issues and volatility, illustrated by Bitcoin's dropping to a low of around $18K at the end of 2022. Furthermore, unlike tech which benefited from the enthusiasm around the artificial intelligence theme, the dark moment for the world of cryptocurrencies persisted in the beginning of 2023. As a result, CleanSpark’s quarterly revenues which were previously on an uptrend, took a hit (chart below) as the miner obtained less money for the same quantity of Bitcoin sold, with the recovery only happening this year. Data by YCharts Now, instead of selling the digital assets it produces, a miner can HODL or hold part or all of them in its treasury. In this regard, strategies differ, and looking back at the beginning of 2022, CleanSpark was more of an exception as it sold most of its produce, instead of HODLing as was generally the norm among miners. This strategy paid off as, unlike peers, it did not have to eventually sell at a lower price. More recently, the miner changed its policy to favor HODLing. Thus, during the month of September, it mined 643 Bitcoins and sold only 80, or 12%, as it was left with a total of 2,240 Bitcoin holdings. Comparing with Peers in View of Halving Now, this is much lower than the 7,327 BTCs and 13,726 BTCs held by Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ) and Marathon Digital ( MARA ) respectively. This means that these two miners' balance sheets (in terms of cryptos) are stronger going into the Bitcoin halving event. For investors, halving refers to the process of reducing the rate of generation of cryptocurrencies or coins per block (of blockchain) implying less reward for Bitcoin miners. Looking further, this feature was coded into Bitcoin's software code at the time of creation to ensure that its supply becomes limited with time thereby conferring to it more value. Hence, currently, miners receive 6.25 bitcoins (BTC) for each block they successfully mine, and the next halving event, to take place sometime in April 2024 will cut this to 3.125. In other words, it means that mining difficulty will increase by two times in about six months, making it important for CleanSpark to catch up. In this respect, it produced 643 BTC in September which is more than RIOT’s 362, and is second only to Mara’s 1242 . Therefore, while not being the first in terms of production capacity among the publicly listed miners, one still has to reckon with CleanSpark, especially given the speed with which it is boosting capacity. Chart prepared using data from (www.seekingalpha.com) For this purpose, during its third-quarter earnings call on August 9, the company reported that it was increasing production capacity from its current hashrate of over 9 EH/s to 15 EH/s over the next half of the year through additional mining rigs. Now, considering the 659 BTC and 643 BTC for August and September respectively, this leads to an average of 651. Now, for October to April 2024, or seven months, this comes to about 4,557 (651 x 7). Now considering that it sells about 12%, its treasury will be left with 3,990 Bitcoins, which added to the 2,240 gives 6,230 BTC in total. This figure does not take into account that it is adding capacity by around 67% (15/9) within the seven-month period leading to April 2024. Therefore, CleanSpark has shifted gears in time to accumulate the digital commodity which is positive for its treasury as halving introduces additional constraints on supply. This also means that in case demand remains the same, the prices should go up. Additionally, as a miner, it makes sense to HODL since this means receiving direct compensation for every block mined from the Bitcoin network. Another key factor to consider is production costs. Valuing in View of Better Growth and Profitability These costs have to factor in the halving event as well as energy expenses, which makes it important to run facilities that are power efficient while operating at scale. Along the same lines, it is important to have all the mining rigs operating optimally instead of some lying idle as it consumes space. Therefore, irrespective of whether a miner has 500K or 200K machines and is producing one thousand or 500 coins per month, it is efficiency that ultimately counts. To this end, according to CleanSpark's CEO who is also the founder, the miner ""runs the most efficient facilities at scale in the industry"". Now, being efficient, or achieving more hash rates using less power should translate into better margins. Again, making a comparison with Marathon and RIOT, I found that CleanSpark indeed has the highest margins at 43.8% (as shown in the table below) and this despite having fewer revenues (on a trailing twelve-month basis) on which to spread its fixed costs. Comparison of main metrics with MARA and RIOT (seekingalpha.com) Furthermore, the degree by which its profitability exceeds peers, or more than 19% compared to Marathon, shows that CleanSpark has attained one of its corporate objectives to be ""one of the largest most efficient publicly traded Bitcoin mining operators in the world"". Shifting to growth, the miner scores better too as shown in the above table, a performance that is not being rewarded by the market when looking at its price-to-sales multiple of only 2.25x. Adjusting for a 67% increase of the P/S to 3.76x (2.25 x 1.67) which is still undervalued relative to its peers, the share price can potentially reach $7.75 (4.64 x 1.67). This target remains well below Wall Street's average estimate of $9.97 . This is a fair target, given that it is based on CleanSpark's capacity expansion of 67% which can further be enhanced by its higher level of efficiency. The miner also seems to be getting the timing right, notably by selling Bitcoin on the open market before the 2022 market slump and recently favoring HODLing, both in view of the halving event and Bitcoin breaking the $35K resistance level. At the same time, it is using the $22.5 million of cash available at the end of June 2023 to "" fully fund "" the purchase of additional equipment. Moreover, its treasury boasts a $14 million equivalent of Bitcoin while debt stood at only $18.8 million. Therefore, with better growth and profitability metrics, while boasting a healthy balance sheet, CleanSpark is a Strong Buy. This said it is important to factor in some of the volatility risks impacting Bitcoin which is the miner's underlying asset. A Strong Buy After Factoring Risks Some of these can be traced down to the war between Israel and Hamas, which weighed down on crypto assets according to Coindesk, in sharp contrast to March 2022 when the cryptocurrency spiked to 16% because of an escalation in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. On a separate note, there is also giant asset manager BlackRock's ( BLK ) application to issue spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust as I recently elaborated in a thesis . Now, this ETF which still has to be approved by the SEC re-appeared on a list of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation ((DTCC)), a financial services company, after being delisted for a few hours. This may have been interpreted by some investors as a sign of a launch of the spot Bitcoin ETF happening sooner rather than later. Consequently, with some of the trading activity apparently dependent on ETF-related developments, there could be volatility to the downside, and, for this matter, the stock's RSI of 60.38 indicates a slightly overbought condition. Also, the stock price being above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, but below the 50-day moving averages shows that the price action will likely see fluctuations. However, for those who want to focus on the longer term, or April 2024 and beyond, CleanSpark deserves much better, with its proven track record of getting the timing right. Finally, by going through some of the factors that influence the price of Bitcoin and the impact of the halving event, this thesis rates CleanSpark as a Strong Buy, due to its undervaluation with respect to peers. Also, it is adding capacity to its mining fleet while operating with optimum efficiency.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4647446-cleanspark-deserves-much-better?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19769182.jpeg

Marathon Digital is considered the best pure-play miner in the industry, with a treasury policy to retain BTC mined and astute use of equity and debt. Marathon Digital owns a significant amount of BTC and uses its balance sheet to build out mining infrastructure, positioning it for growth. The Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining space offers a publicly traded leverage play on the commodity's price movement. With a slew of Bitcoin spot ETFs potentially entering the marketplace post the SEC decision not to challenge a recent court ruling and the halving cycle rapidly approaching in April 2024, multiple bullish factors are driving the BTC price higher. The article below will discuss my view on why Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ) remains the best pure-play miner in the industry. Bitcoin as a Commodity Most are undoubtedly keenly aware of many of BTC's attributes, and I would like to give a quick primer on some of the key characteristics as to why I believe it is best termed a commodity. The price of BTC has followed an orderly cycle where the block reward awarded to a miner is reduced by 50% (the halving cycle). The goal of the halving cycle is to reduce supply, which should drive prices higher over time, thus catalyzing the typical boom-bust cycle seen in the commodity space. Marathon Digital When analyzing the publicly traded Bitcoin miners, I zeroed in on a few key attributes that I believe are paramount to ensuring the business has a long runway of growth ahead of it. For the miners to outperform the underlying move in BTC, a dominant strategy in two areas is critical to drive the performance. The first element is a treasury policy to retain some of the BTC mined. Much like MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), led by its visionary CEO Michael Saylor, who has successfully utilized a treasury strategy with strategic issuance of debt to acquire a large sum of BTC with ultra-cheap debt and profits from its legacy software business. If you are a believer in the asset, why would you be comfortable selling it at $35k at the time of composing this article, where if past history is a guide, a run well above 100% is probable 18 months post-halving if past historical trends continue to unfold? Is that 5% money market rate really that attractive? The second element is the astute use of equity and debt to build out the mining infrastructure to capitalize on the opportunity. The industry remains highly fragmented, with the largest cost of the power utilized to run the miners. Often, the least expensive power is found in more remote locations, requiring the investment to build out the infrastructure. I believe Marathon Digital is well-positioned as it easily passes these two criteria. Let's examine each one in depth. Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset As of its recent investor presentation , MARA owns 13,726 BTC, a 5 percent increase from its holdings in August 2023. To add further context to these numbers, MARA mined 1,232 in September, or an average of 41.1 BTC per day. The average block reward is 6.25 coins, with 900 BTC on average issued per day. MARA accounts for over 4% of all BTC awarded in the month of September, a truly staggering amount. And yes, they did not retain all the BTC generated as they sold 800 coins to fund operations. Let's keep in mind the price of BTC was well south of $30k for the month of September. MARA's cost base remains relatively stable, whereas if the price of BTC jumps, such as in the month of October 2023 (up over 20%), MARA will be able to retain a more significant percentage of BTC mined, thus growing the USD value of its treasury stock while paying less in BTC terms to produce another BTC. It is a genuinely fantastic feedback loop that should help increase the share price. Astute Use of Debt The astute use of its balance sheet to build out its mining rigs while avoiding the cost of building out the infrastructure sets MARA apart from its peers. MARA operates in the US, North Dakota, and Texas, the two most friendly mining states from BTC. Both have large swaths of trapped power, especially TX, that make them ideal to host BTC miners. The climate in TX is quite hot in the summer, affecting hash rates as the state regulator, ERCOT, will require power curtailment. MARA has partnered with Abu Dhabi for an immersion cooling site where MARA is responsible for 20 percent of the cost and shares a proportional amount of the bitcoin earned. An immersion cooling plant operates a bit differently than a traditional mining site where the rigs are submerged in a gel that ""cools"" the system, thus allowing for lower power consumption due to removing the cooling fans generally on the system. Risks to the Thesis If our base case is BTC will exceed its all-time high (roughly double its current price at the time of publication), what can be a reasonable expectation for the move in MARA? Assuming a treasury holding of 14k BTC at $70k gives us a value of 980 million plus the value of the mining operation. MARA would be producing at least 21 coins per day post halving at $70k per coin, nets them a rate of $1.47 million per day, which annualizes to a revenue rate of $500 million per year. I am using a $30 per share price target, which works out to over 2x its current price. Naturally, if the price of BTC exceeds $70k and or MARA produces more BTC per day, the math becomes more favorable. For those who wish to diversify their holdings in miners, kindly review my recent analysis of a Miner ETF. Understanding mining dynamics and the risks involved is also essential to take a more balanced view of the opportunity. The availability of cheap power is not a given, and curtailments due to inclement weather will impede production. A widespread fire or loss of use will affect production. There is no guarantee the price of BTC will exceed its old high, rendering the favorable outlook for MARA null and void. An investment in MARA should be viewed as a speculation with the potential for catastrophic loss.

Federal prosecutors allege Eisenberg committed commodities manipulation and wire fraud when he deployed a ""highly profitable trading strategy"" against the Solana-based decentralized crypto exchange Mango Markets in October 2022.  The trial is being brought in the Southern District of New York, where just this week a team of lawyers secured the conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried in a quick-turnaround case that played out in less than a year.  Eisenberg's trial schedule was moving nearly as speedily until late October, when the Bureau of Prisons moved him from a New Jersey federal jail to Brookyln's more restrictive Metropolitan Detention Center, hampering defense lawyers' efforts to prepare for his December 8 trial date, according to a filing.  His lawyers also requested additional time because of the ""complex and novel legal and factual issues"" at play.

19766041,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559080,1699048821,US Authorities Confiscate $54 Million In Ethereum From Convicted Drug Dealer,"In recent developments, US authorities led by US Attorney Philip R. Sellinger successfully seized $54 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) from Christopher Castelluzzo, a convicted drug dealer operating in Lake Hopatcong, New Jersey. Related Reading: Cardano Summit 2023: Charles Hoskinson Takes The Stage, Day 1 Recap Massive Crypto Bust The US Attorney’s Office filed a civil forfeiture action to recover previously seized cryptocurrency that was determined to be the proceeds of an illegal narcotics distribution scheme operating in and around New Jersey. US Attorney Philip R. Sellinger emphasized law enforcement’s “commitment” to seizing financial gains from criminal activity, regardless of the form they take. Sellinger further stated: The civil action we are taking today seeks to recover millions of dollars of cryptocurrency, which the defendant allegedly obtained from drug sales. Whether it’s as simple as bags of cash or as sophisticated as cryptocurrency, we will take the steps necessary to seize financial gains defendants obtain from criminal activity. According to the US Department of Justice’s (DOJ) press release on the case, the prosecution sheds light on using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum by criminals on the darknet to evade detection. In addition, James E. Dennehy, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in Newark, stated that the FBI played a critical role in uncovering the illegal conduct and ill-gotten proceeds. Drug Trafficker’s Ethereum Stash Seized According to court documents and the investigations conducted, Christopher Castelluzzo and his associates conspired to sell narcotics between 2010 and 2015. In 2013, they allegedly began trading drugs on darknet platforms in exchange for Bitcoin. Castelluzzo, using proceeds from narcotics sales, participated in Ethereum’s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in July 2014, acquiring 30,000 Ethereum. Additionally, Castelluzzo received 30,000 ETH Classic in 2016. Castelluzzo’s plan to move the funds to a tax haven in Ireland, Malta, or the Bahamas, or potentially keep them in USDT (Tether), was revealed in forfeiture documents. However, a subsequent search warrant led to the raid of Brian Krewson’s residence, an associate of Castelluzzo. Police discovered the relevant crypto wallets under Krewson’s control, and after obtaining the necessary passwords, law enforcement executed the seizure of the Ethereum, valued at $31 million at the time. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Rally 135%? Here’s What Needs To Happen Currently serving concurrent 20-year federal and state prison sentences for drug distribution convictions, Castelluzzo attempted to evade taxes and transfer the 30,000 Ethereum out of the United States while incarcerated. However, Castelluzzo’s plans were intercepted when recorded prison telephone calls exposed his efforts to launder the cryptocurrency. As a result, the United States intervened and seized Castelluzzo’s cryptocurrency holdings linked to his drug trafficking crimes. The current value of the 30,000 Ethereum stands at approximately $54 million, underscoring the significant impact of the seizure. As of the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,815, reflecting a 0.9% increase over the past 24 hours and a steady upward trend of over 2% in the past seven days, exhibiting strong bullish momentum in the market.

42419185,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE2cn,1699046175,A Tale of 2 SEC Commissioners,"Last week, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler and Commissioner Hester Peirce issued two public statements that show radically different understandings of the application of securities law to crypto.  While Commissioner Peirce has proven constructive and shown a willingness to improve regulatory shortcomings, Chairman Gensler has been anything but, and instead has displayed a flair for political theater and subtle intimidation.  The two have radically contrasting approaches to leadership.  Rodrigo Seira is special counsel at Paradigm. He was previously outside counsel to Cooley LLP and a founding member of DLX Law.     Gensler’s critiques  On Tuesday, Oct. 24, Chair Gensler delivered a speech in Washington D.C. that harshly criticized the crypto industry and accused its participants of intentionally violating securities laws. His remarks were delivered at the Securities Enforcement Forum, to a crowd of lawyers who are in the business of representing clients in front of the SEC.  To put the scene in context, Bloomberg's Zeke Faux was there giving away free copies of his new book, ""Number Go Up"" (which is highly critical of crypto), and coffee mugs with the logo of the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX had adorned the center of every table. Those mugs were filled with mints, a cheeky gesture by the event organizers given former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s ongoing trial.  See also: If PayPal's Stablecoin Is a Security, Anything Could Be | Opinion  At one point during his remarks, Gensler asked every lawyer in the room who represents crypto clients to raise their hand, and then ridiculed the claim that any project with a lawyer could claim to be decentralized. Sitting in the crowd, I couldn't help but feel that Gensler's statements that crypto lawyers should weigh their client advocacy against an overriding “public interest” were meant to intimidate lawyers from representing crypto clients.  Peirce’s recognition  Three days later, SEC Commissioner Peirce issued a statement in response to the crypto project LBRY announcing it was shutting down as a result of an agency enforcement action. In stark contrast to Gensler’s comments, Peirce’s statement recognized the work the SEC needs to undertake in order to provide a viable framework for crypto in the U.S.  She also highlighted the negative impact that the current enforcement-only approach has on investors and showed empathy for the entrepreneurs trying to make sense of the regulations.  One of the SEC’s core missions is to protect investors. Yet against the backdrop of several crypto projects imploding resulting in large losses to U.S. consumers, Chairman Gensler seems to abdicate all responsibility for allowing this harm to occur during his watch. In his view, these “problems” are simply the result of “wide-ranging non-compliance” by the crypto industry. If only crypto projects would come in and register using “a form on our website” there would be no harm.  Of course, the problem is that it's impossible for crypto projects to comply with the current SEC regulations. SEC registration entails a host of regulations that apply to crypto assets, the entity that registers them and other participants in the ecosystem, all which make the functioning of most crypto protocols impossible. The history of failed projects that have attempted to register is proof of this fact.  Moreover, the existing securities framework was designed to regulate securities instruments that differ fundamentally from crypto assets, and as a result current registration forms rely on a set of disclosures that are inadequate for crypto’s unique aspects and leave investors vulnerable.  Gensler’s SEC  Early in his tenure at the SEC, Chair Gensler recognized the existing regulatory gap and called on Congress to update the regulations. But the political climate changed, and with it Gensler’s recognition of the problem and his willingness to act. Therefore, despite repeated industry attempts to get clarity and the agency updating the disclosure framework for other types of instruments, Gensler’s SEC has done nothing to provide a viable regulatory framework for crypto.  Instead, Chair Gensler has been intransigent and focused on running a media campaign that includes highly produced “office hours” videos, charging celebrities like Kim Kardashian and timing enforcement actions to conflict with congressional hearings on crypto in order to steal headlines.  Much to her credit, Commissioner Peirce has been steadfast in her recognition that the current SEC framework does not work for crypto. And unlike the Chair, she doesn’t shift the blame to the industry for not making sense of absurd regulations.  In her statement on LBRY, she highlighted the impact the current SEC approach to regulating crypto has on entrepreneurs, who confront an unclear regulatory landscape and are forced to shut down their projects if they happen to draw the short straw and face an SEC enforcement action.  She also questions whether this enforcement-only approach benefits the consumers the SEC is tasked with protecting; consumers who are left holding tokens of a now defunct project.  Peirce’s accountability  But she doesn’t stop at just diagnosing the problem. The role of regulators is to identify policy issues and attempt to address them. Showing the type of self-reflection, accountability and humor that defines the best leaders, Commissioner Peirce holds herself responsible and has been actively working to address the existing regulatory gap.  See also: 'Crypto Mom' Hester Peirce: SEC 'Disappoints' When It Comes to Crypto  To that end Commissioner Peirce introduced a proposed safe harbor for token issuances, which was reworked and re-introduced to account for community feedback. Her statement on LBRY ends by repeating her plea for the crypto community to send her ideas about how the SEC might “right its course on crypto and innovation more broadly.”  This is a plea that the crypto community and those focused on keeping innovation on America’s shores should take seriously. Let’s empower regulators like Commissioner Peirce and make sure that by the time she’s tending to her bees in 2028, she can do so with a sense of satisfaction for the work we did together.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Rodrigo Seira,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/03/a-tale-of-2-sec-commissioners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b5aa9c6db3010c4ffbc625087aeef9e8cd90549-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The sweeping layoffs may have affected as much as 50% of OpenSea's staff, crypto news outlet Decrypt reported earlier Friday.  The job cuts come as the company prepares to launch a revamped marketplace christened OpenSea 2.0, at a time when NFT prices continue to fall. The platform can be used to trade and collect NFT collections including Bored Apes and Pudgy Penguins.  ""We’re building a new foundation so we can innovate faster and we’ll have some experiences to share with you soon,"" Finzer said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).

Blockchain analytics firm Santiment reported a 9% increase in ADA’s market cap over the past day, which adds to a more than 20% rise over the last two weeks. This growth spurt in valuation aligns with heightened activity on the Cardano network, specifically among large-scale holders, commonly referred to as ‘whales.’ Related Reading: Cardano Summit 2023: Charles Hoskinson Takes The Stage, Day 1 Recap Cardano On-Chain Data Signals Bullish Behavior For ADA Before this latest rise in value, several on-chain metrics hinted at the potential for a short-term increase in ADA’s price. Santiment’s analysis pointed out that two key indicators—address activity and whale transactions—had spiked to levels not seen in three months. This kind of on-chain behavior often precedes market movements, drawing the attention of investors and analysts alike. Digging deeper into the Cardano blockchain data, there’s been a 23% rise in address activity over the past three weeks, according to Santiment, suggesting a growing use case or increased speculation about the altcoin’s future. Concurrently, whale transactions, which are large transfers of ADA often indicative of deep-pocketed investors’ movements, have shot up by more than 32%. Such significant transactions can substantially impact market sentiment, potentially leading to price volatility or, in this case, a bullish trend for ADA. 📈 #Cardano has been the big story Thursday, with its market cap growing +9% in the past 24 hours and now +36% over 2 weeks. As usual, #onchain activity hinted at this #bullish action with $ADA address activity & whale transaction at their highest in 3+ months.… pic.twitter.com/IYBBk3ssf4 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 2, 2023 ADA Latest Price Action: Market Surges Over 10% Meanwhile, in a development that aligns with market expectations, ADA’s price has sustained a bullish trend over recent weeks. Correspondingly, the altcoin’s market capitalization has reflected this positive momentum, swelling by approximately 11.4% in the past week and by nearly 30% in the past two weeks. Significantly, ADA’s market cap has surpassed the $11 billion mark, climbing from the earlier monthly low of around $9 billion. This uptick in market cap value has seen ADA achieve a trading price of $0.32 at the current time, marking an increase of close to 5% in just the last 24 hours. Further bolstering the optimistic market sentiment, ADA’s daily trading volumes have experienced a substantial increase. Where just last Friday, the trading volume hovered around $214 million, there has been a remarkable swell, with the figure soaring to nearly $500 million in the past day.

19762847,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559045,1699041657,Will Cardano Replicate Solana’s Surge? Analyst Reveals Similarities For 80% Rise,"Cardano (ADA) has returned to the radar of crypto investors after an interesting run brought its price up above $0.3. This price level has been elusive for a while but eventually, the bulls have gotten a hold of it. As the market faces an impending downturn, Cardano’s run-up could be threatened. However, one crypto analyst believes that ADA could have gone the way of Solana over the past few days. Cardano Doing A Solana Run In a TradingView post, crypto analyst Alan Santana revealed their expectations for the Cardano price. The initial post which was made on October 30 used the daily timeframe of the coin’s performance to figure out what could be ahead for it. Santana points out that ADA continued to show bullish consolidation for the prior week which no doubt contributed to its rising prices. Eventually, the price did break out and ADA made a run for the $0.3 resistance and ended up beating it. But even this achievement is small fish compared to Solana’s 80% run. Related Reading: Legal Expert Explains Why Ripple Will Always Back XRP The analyst pointed out that ADA did not retrace as expected by the bullish consolidation continued on the way up instead. Like with any consolidation in an asset, this helped Cardano to gather strength and momentum that could trigger a price pump. Santana was proven right when ADA did eventually bear $0.3 and ran up as high as $0.31, after which came the update to the initial post. Here, the crypto analyst alludes to the correct market correction that brought Bitcoin back below $35,000 and noted that major altcoins will follow any retracement made by the market. Source: Tradingview.com However, for Cardano, the analyst noted that it is moving in the same way that Solana did to hit a new yearly high. In the last few days, the SOL price moved independently of Bitcoin and Cardano is starting to do the same. While Bitcoin is down 1.94% in the last day, Cardano is seeing 5% gains in the same time frame. If this breakout continues, then ADA could break away from the Bitcoin trend completely and form its own. Following Solana’s rise, such a rally would put ADA well on the path toward the $0.4 resistance. “When the market is set to continue straight up, while some pairs will retrace a little bit others will continue growing with force,” the analyst said. Santana’s chart points to a possible rise to $0.35 at the top of the rally. This would mean an 80% rise in price from the initial price at the time the analysis was made. Thus, a very similar rally pattern to that of Solana. ADA Investors Take The Lead Cardano’s rise over the last few days has not gone unnoticed and a recent report from on-chain tracker Santiment has hinted at what could be the possible driver behind it. According to the post, ADA whale and address activity rose quickly and touched 32% in the last three weeks. This brought the on-chain activity to a new three-month high. Related Reading: ProShares Goes Short On Ethereum With New ETF Launch The price which seems to be hell-bent on pulling a Solana also rose 36% in a two-week period, making it one of the top winners during this time. A continuation of this on-chain activity trend will push the price further in the coming weeks. Source: Santiment on X However, with the price having risen so much, some level of profit-taking is expected. This would inadvertently lead to a price dip. But as long as demand stays up, it’ll only be a temporary setback.

42419192,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE2ft,1699038058,Sam Bankman-Fried Verdict: The Crypto Industry Reacts,"With Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction yesterday on seven counts of fraud in federal court, the long-running FTX saga appears to be nearing a conclusion (though sentencing and several live issues are yet to be finalized fully).  The question now is what the verdict means for the future of the industry? Will it prove a lasting stain on crypto’s reputation, making it impossible for companies to persuade users of the merits of digital assets? Or will it serve as a moment of closure, proof that the legal system, journalism and the industry itself can clean its ship?  CoinDesk reached out to several long-time crypto watchers for comment and received several quotes unsolicited as well. They follow below (we’ll update with more as we receive them).  Paul Brody, head of blockchain at EY:  “It’s a wonderful moment for crypto. Accountability and the sense that bad actors will be punished is important – not just for deterring bad actors but to give confidence to those who are operating with integrity. If you’re investing in a business, you need to know that the competition will be on a level playing field and that integrity is not something that puts you at a competitive disadvantage.”  Noelle Acheson, former head of research at CoinDesk and writer of the “Crypto Is Macro Now” newsletter:  “The verdict came as a huge relief. While it looked increasingly likely as the trial wore on, there was always the outside chance that SBF would yet again embarrass the industry by showing that crypto fraud can be hard to prosecute. That didn't happen, and the swift and unanimous decision from the jury definitively shows that fraud is fraud, and crypto service providers can and should be held accountable. The closure of the SBF phase should help to show the next wave of investors that crypto markets can be grown up. And hopefully now we can get back to building the capital market infrastructure the ecosystem deserves.”  Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation:  “This case was always about fraud, and this outcome confirms that the jury understood who and what was on trial here.  “The jury heard evidence that Sam Bankman-Fried was out for himself, and that's reflected in the verdict. This case serves as a reminder that rules that have existed for a long time created a path to accountability for these crimes.  “My hope is that we can turn the focus to the victims here rather than continuing to give airtime to the latest person who committed one of the oldest crimes on the books – fraud.”  U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs:  “This verdict is a victory for everyone fighting fraud and scams in crypto. In this trial, we saw how crypto companies like FTX think the law doesn’t apply to them, gamble with consumers’ money and lie to the public. Americans continue to lose money every day in crypto scams and frauds. We need to crack down on abuses and can’t let the crypto industry write its own rulebook.”  Preston Byrne, corporate partner and practices in the Brown Rudnick's Digital Commerce group:  I would not read too much into the SBF trial result as a forward-looking matter. What’s done is done. SBF is off the board as a major player in crypto, probably for the rest of his working life. What this is, is a significant and decisive victory for the U.S. Attorney’s office in the SDNY convincing a jury that fraud is fraud even in a context where complex, novel technology is involved. I would expect that the USAO has a lot more confidence today that they can win other big cases against bad actors in crypto than they did yesterday.  Joshua Klayman, U.S. head of fintech and head of blockchain and digital assets at Linklaters:  “People sometimes talk about divine justice. Yesterday’s verdict may just be sublime justice, with the criminal trial of Sam Bankman-Fried wrapped up in a bow exactly one year to the day after CoinDesk’s award-winning reporting about Alameda [Research’s] balance sheet revealed the empire to be, arguably, a house of cards. After a month-long trial, where SBF famously took the stand, the Manhattan jury took only a few hours to find him guilty of all seven criminal charges brought against him.  “In terms of winners and losers for the crypto space, it remains to be seen. In my view, the prosecution was successful in convincing the jury that the case came down to things like basic fraud, which transcends any particular industry, and the swift verdict is likely to embolden prosecutors, who may be less willing to enter into plea arrangements and more likely to go to trial.  “I also think that, in a way, this verdict is a win for the crypto industry itself. After all, it was the industry (including crypto journalists) that discovered and exposed SBF’s wrongdoing, and certain market participants that were themselves harmed by FTX and Alameda testified in the case against SBF. SBF being found guilty may be an important milestone or marker that enables the digital asset space and the broader market to move on from the events of 2022, because the bad actor is, in fact, being held accountable.  “To the extent that digital asset market participants continue to emphasize that bad actors and fraud should be held accountable – and to emphasize key strengths of the technology, including transparency, that may help deter or root-out criminal behavior – I think that can lead to wins for the industry. Despite the rapid rise and fall of FTX and Alameda, builders have kept on building. Our space is resilient, and crypto lives on.”     Michael Selig, counsel in the Asset Management Department, Willkie:  ""The trial verdict offers some degree of resolution and closure on the events of the past few years and provides an opportunity for a crypto industry reset with lawmakers and regulators. The events of the past few years inflicted immense reputational damage on the industry and caused countless regulatory investigations and Congressional inquiries into market participants and practices, overshadowing many recent technological innovations.  ""I have no doubt that the SEC and CFTC will continue to aggressively enforce industry compliance with legacy laws and do not expect Congress to pass new crypto legislation any time soon. Yet both the crypto industry and regulators were caught in the crosshairs of common enemies and this chapter is coming to a close. I am hopeful that industry and regulators can now turn the page and find common ground for a sensible regulatory solution.""  Kevin J. O’Brien, Ford O'Brien Landy LLP Partner, and a former assistant U. S. attorney:  An appeal “doesn't appear very likely” for Sam Bankman-Fried, he said on CDTV today.  ""[Mark S. Cohen, SBF’s attorney] is a very able lawyer … but on the face of it, there doesn't seem to be much for them to work with here,"" O’Brien said. The ""trial was very well-tried by the government.""  But he doesn’t think Sam Bankman-Fried will spend the rest of his life in prison, more like ""something in the neighborhood of 15 years, or maybe even 20 years."" ""He's a relatively young man, his whole life is in front of him,"" O’Brien said.  ""I don't think the judge is going to want to destroy his chances of having a full and productive adult life.""  Yat Siu, Animoca Brands executive chairman:  SBF's downfall had “really cast a dark shadow over the entire industry” and this verdict serves as “a new beginning.”  This verdict made it clear this was “simply a case of fraud. It wasn’t a case of the industry having an issue.”  The trial against Bankman-Fried demonstrates that there are consequences for bad actors and that ""gives people a certain sense of more safety.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/03/sam-bankman-fried-verdict-the-crypto-industry-reacts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/346f85e627a5e75db1ee16ebde81d77a5794c8e3-1920x897.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

During the three-day event, speakers, founders, and the community will voice views on the growing sector and the future of the network and blockchain technology as Cardano enters a critical stage in its development. Related Reading: Cardano Summit 2023: Charles Hoskinson Takes The Stage, Day 1 Recap Our team had the opportunity to speak with the team behind SingularityNET, one of the first projects that has worked on integrating blockchain, machine learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) products. The community has been asking for staking features and finally got a response. SingularityNET Launches Staking For AGIX Tokens During Cardano Summit 2023 During the event, SingularityNET revealed the implementation of staking capabilities for users holding their native token, AGIX. In this way, users can generate a yield from holding the token and contribute to the adoption of Cardano and SingularityNET. 📢 Exciting News: AGIX Staking is coming to @Cardano! Get exclusive insights by visiting our booth at the #CardanoSummit2023 – we’ve got a special surprise waiting for you! Read our latest blog post for more details: https://t.co/qajpfZfdUL#AGIXonCardano #CardanoCommunity — SingularityNET (@SingularityNET) November 2, 2023 The staking capabilities will roll out for everyone later this month. As mentioned, SingularityNET has been working on the intersection between the nascent industry and AI long before these technologies became a global trend. Now, their partnership with IOG and Cardano makes them a perfect candidate to benefit from the adoption of both as major companies pour capital and effort into integrating with AI and blockchain-based projects. Our team sat down with Janet Adams, COO of SingularityNET, and Mihaela Ulieru on the future of blockchain and AI, the role of the community, and their partnership with Cardano. This is what they told us. Q: Could you tell us about your experience during the Cardano Summit 2023? What does it mean for the SingularityNET ecosystem and its partnership with Cardano? Adams: Feel like Home. When I come to a Cardano Summit, our partnership with Carano is very deep. It’s very strong. I have so many friends here today wandering around all of the different booths, meeting all the different thriving businesses, that are building on Cardano meeting so many friends of Singularity Net. We’re here with Dessa (Desdemona) Robot. Dessa is really popular. She’s our pop star, our rockstar robot using a humanoid robot, of course, built by Hanson Robotics. It’s been very positive. I’m having a number of really positive discussions with all of the Cardano community. But what’s really important for us this year at SingularityNET is that our AGIX ADA staking solution on Carano is ready to launch in the next one to two weeks. And that’s something that I always get asked for by the Cardano community, “when staking.” And so now it’s finally here, I’m here this week and this weekend I’m telling everybody “We now have staking.” They’re all super excited by it. And then that opens the door to us, porting the full SingularityNET marketplace onto Carano as our next major technical action. Q: SingularityNET was a project being developed on Ethereum and eventually migrated to Cardano; what has been the result of this migration? Are your ties with Cardano and its community growing stronger? Adams: So our visionary founder, Dr. Ben Goertzel, has a strong relationship with Charles Hoskinson. And there are two to three core reasons why Cardano is such a leading blockchain partner for us at SingularityNET. One is that we share a common vision and goal for positive impact on humanity. Cardano was established to bring digital identity to populations who don’t have these kinds of solutions. And the shared passion that I feel when I meet the Cardano community is for positive impact. So that’s number one within the whole crypto community. And I meet many, many communities around the world. The Cardano community is the most heart-led, the most purpose-driven, the community that really cares about dramatically improving life on the planet for the people who need it most and reducing inequalities. We have shared interests in Africa, where we both have offices as well. So one is the purity of purpose, the second is the mathematical foundation of the Cardano blockchain. It’s clearly in the long run, it’s clearly the most mathematically robust blockchain that has been developed. And because our artificial intelligence is also clearly mathematically driven as a mathematically driven solution, it’s really important that our AI runs on really solid, really secure, really scalable blockchain infrastructure. And then the third reason is we wanted to take advantage of the much better gas fees on Cardano, but the community, the strength of the community, is the most passionate community in the world. We’re the most passionate company in the world, and our community is also super passionate. And so you bring those two passions together with a blockchain that is more robust, more scalable, more solid, more mathematically proven than any other blockchain. It’s clear that this is a very strong opportunity for us to work together, SingularityNET and Cardano are building the most important technologies of all time to reduce inequalities. Q: Could you tell us about SingularityNET’s latest projects and how Artificial Intelligence (AI) connects with blockchain technology? Moreover, why build on Cardano rather than in a different network? Ulieru: Some of our most outstanding projects are building the future of Artificial General Intelligence, such as Zarqa – a large language model that performs much better than ChatGPT due to our approach, which is building with a layer of symbolic reasoning on top of the normal neural networks methods implied in ChatGPT. Another dearest to my heart is the Cogito Protocol, which has a first application Green Coin – a stablecoin pegged to Sustainability Index and which will grow as we make strides to address the climate and sustainability conundrum. So it offers a holistic perspective on incentivizing action that improves the state of the world at scale. Rejuve is a health impact project that enables people to improve their health (an App is guiding them on healthy lifestyle tricks) including a genetic product that improves longevity. And at last, Sophiaverse – a game in the metaverse enabling AGI to train by interacting with people via a game structure. There are many more and all building on Cardano as our preferred blockchain since it had the best technological stack. Q: How do you envision the future of AI running on the blockchain? And what do you expect Cardano and SingularityNET to achieve in the coming years? Ulieru: AI is all about processing large amounts of data, and the greatest conundrum is that it infringes on the privacy rights of individuals. With Blockchain this is hard to solve as well, given the transparency inherent in the design. Cardano came up with an innovation, which was today presented by Charles Hoskinson here at the Summit, the Midnight blockchain, with its “dust” token, which can enable the processing of encrypted data. There is also a development on the scaling of Cardano – since SingularityNET is expanding Hydra, the side chain of Cardano, with a novel implementation of a “ledgerless” blockchain named Hypercycle (see hypercycle.ai), which is enabling the processing of encrypted data and as such preserves the privacy. Hypercycle was chosen by SingularityNET to be “the Internet of AI” since their innovative implementation also comes with a “router” for the Internet of AI which everyone can install instead of their normal router and thus bring the AI algorithms to their data, which they can keep private and secure on their own personal router. Related Reading: Cardano November Momentum – An Over 40% Increase In The Cards? We at SingularityNET chose Cardano because it is by far the most innovative blockchains in terms of technology out there. The Keynote of Charles Hoskinson today proved exactly this, including the flexibility of Cardano to accommodate interoperability with all other blockchains, which we at SingularityNET praise a lot, since we are blockchain agnostic and want to enable everyone to use us. And yesterday we also announced that we began staking AGIX on the Cardano blockchain.

Cryptocurrency Futures Market Has Seen Liquidations Totaling $137 Million Today According to data from CoinGlass, a large amount of liquidations have taken place in the cryptocurrency futures market during the past day. “Liquidation” here refers to a forced closure of a futures contract being done by the derivative contract with which said position is open. A contract is liquidated when it amasses losses equal to a certain percentage of the margin (that is, the initial collateral that the holder had put forth when opening the contract). Related Reading: Solana Whales Deposit To Exchanges, Selloff Incoming? As it’s easy for traders’ bets to fail during volatile periods, it’s not surprising that the volatility from the past day has induced liquidations throughout the market. The below table shows the data for the liquidations that have occurred in the sector during the last day. Looks like the sector has registered a significant amount of liquidations in the past 24 hours | Source: CoinGlass As you can see, the cryptocurrency futures market has seen liquidations amounting to about $137 million in the past day. Out of these, around $113 million of the contracts were long positions. This means that more than 82% of the liquidation flush in this period has involved the long holders. This is consistent with the price action, as most of the liquidations have been triggered by a plunge in the Bitcoin price from above $35,400 to the $34,000 mark. Such large liquidation events are popularly called “squeezes.” Since the squeeze from the last 24 hours has seen the longs on the losing side, the event was a “long squeeze.” As the below table displays, Bitcoin-related contracts have unsurprisingly contributed the most towards this latest squeeze. The distribution of the liquidations by symbol | Source: CoinGlass Bitcoin saw $40 million in futures liquidations, while Ethereum registered almost half of those at $21 million. Out of the altcoins, Solana (SOL) observed the highest liquidations. SOL has seen a bit of an explosion recently, so it’s not unexpected that it has attracted a large amount of speculators towards it. As a natural consequence of this higher interest in the cryptocurrency, its liquidations have been more than the other altcoins. Mass liquidation events like today’s aren’t exactly a rare occurrence in the cryptocurrency sector, due to extreme amounts of leverage being easily accessible and the volatility that most of the coins witness on the regular. Related Reading: Ethereum Yet To Shake Off 2022 Bear Hangover: Glassnode It would appear that today’s liquidation squeeze has been unable to put off speculators, as the Bitcoin open interest (a measure of the total amount of contracts open on the futures market) is still at high values.

Lucas Outumuro, research head of IntoTheBlock, said the outperformance of smaller, riskier tokens is a sign of capital rotation from bitcoin and ether after their sizable rallies, a typical behavior from investors during crypto bull markets.  ""Historically crypto cycles have followed the trend where BTC leads the first surge, then ETH, with capital progressively being allocated to lower cap and riskier bets,"" Outumuro said. ""This week's trend suggests this rotation is beginning to take place as BTC and ETH trend sideways while DeFi and alternative layer 1 tokens record a strong rebound.""  ""Despite the rotation into riskier assets, the demand flowing into crypto appears to be relatively organic, led by spot buying,"" Outumuro noted. ""Even though the price momentum may be getting overheated short-term, there are signs of sustainable demand driving the crypto uptrend.""",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/03/bitcoin-stalls-at-35k-as-gains-flow-to-altcoins-in-cryptos-early-bull-market-rotation-analyst-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37a1e4f1c901640ede4bdd745664d230f6c477a3-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419189,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE2gv,1699035973,Who Won and Lost Most in Sam Bankman-Fried's Criminal Scheme?,"Well, it’s over. Sam Bankman-Fried has been convicted on all seven counts, with another trial on the docket for this spring to gauge SBF’s guilt and responsibility in a multi-year scheme to buy political favor for the FTX crypto exchange. At this point, Bankman-Fried faces up to 110 years in prison, though sentencing won’t happen for months.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  For many crypto fans, SBF’s conviction is the first of many that need to happen to rid the industry of bad actors, scammers and thieves that captured the public imagination and defined what this technology fundamentally is during the 2020-21 bull run. Over the long term, it’s entirely possible crypto polishes out the tarnish.  See also: Could Sam Bankman-Fried's Saga Happen Without Crypto?  Of course, SBF can appeal the decision and angle for a mistrial, arguing he didn't have adequate access to ADHD medication, his legal team (after being remanded into jail for repeatedly violating the terms of his bail) and, maybe, that District Judge Lewis Kaplan was heavy-handed in his oversight of the trial.  But legal experts largely agree those claims are groundless, and that the former Boy Wonder is likely to spend the next few decades in prison. As is his wont, Bankman-Fried took a gamble that he could use customer and investor funds for essentially anything he wanted at the moment, illegally, and get away with it.  The jury's complete, quick and decisive ruling is clear: Bankman-Fried lost that wager. But who or what, if anyone or anything, will come out ahead at the end of this trial? While prison time is a type of retribution for tens of thousands of victims of SBF, it will not exactly make anyone whole or eliminate the stink of the biggest public spectacle that has haunted crypto for the past year.  First, we should talk about the losers.  Sam Bankman-Fried: SBF was convicted on all counts of wire fraud as well as conspiracy charges to commit wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud and money laundering. During the trial it came to light he had essentially founded FTX as a new source of capital for his hedge fund, Alameda Research, which was a money-losing operation while SBF was the helm and while he pretended he wasn’t. SBF’s scheme to pilfer money from FTX users and his Wall Street and venture capitalist backers to buy luxury property, political favor and FTX equity from rival Binance as well as finance venture investments unraveled, taking the MIT graduate down with it. Worse, Bankman-Fried, while at times admitting he “messed up,” was never exactly contrite and fought the damning accusations until the end, perhaps thinking he could get away with it all, one last time.  The Bankman, Fried Family: SBF’s father, Joseph Bankman, a Stanford law professor and tax expert, was involved in FTX from the early days. He helped SBF spin up shell companies, advised on tax decisions and angled for a raise for his efforts. In trial testimony from SBF’s inner circle (i.e. Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang and Nishad Singh) as well as court documents, Bankman’s name came up time and again. He was present in recovered Signal chat groups, including some of the most pivotal communications between FTX operators as the exchange was failing and SBF’s meeting with Bahamian regulators — moments when SBF could have come clean. Bankman recommended they hire Dan Friedberg, FTX’s “fixer,” who SBF later tried to blame for his own failings in a terminal “advice-of-counsel” defense.  See also: Bankman-Fried's Stanford-Connected Backers and the Decline of Tech Prestige | Opinion  SBF’s parents are thought to have partially financed their son’s criminal defense, and put their family home up as bail collateral. While it’s not yet clear whether they are fully implicated in this multi-million dollar fraud, they are being sued by the FTX bankruptcy estate. Barbara Fried, the founder of a political action committee that Sam funded, in part using customer funds, was previously best known for her offbeat views on justice and blame, which seem to have influenced Sam’s own skewed sense of morality. It’s likely both of their distinguished careers are over. Finally, Gabe Bankman-Fried, the younger son, will likely be overshadowed by his brother’s crimes. While not an FTX employee, Gabe ran a pandemic-prevention nonprofit financed by Sam’s “charitable giving” and apparently harbored equally grandiose ideas about spending other peoples’ money better than they could — at one time entertaining the thought of buying a private island.  Effective Altruism: Although the U.S. Department of Justice lobbied successfully to keep the idea that SBF had “good intentions” out of court, arguing his charitable donations and image as a selfless billionaire would confuse the jury (and were, SBF disclosed, essentially lies), SBF has become synonymous with the effective altruism cause. The EA movement was both SBF’s ethical framework and recruiting ground. Coalescing during the latter half of the 2000s as a branch of utilitarianism, EA can be summed up as “earn to give.” It advocates for high-achieving individuals to pursue careers that enable them to “maximize their impact,” and could be interpreted as condoning crime if it ultimately leads to a better outcome. Adherents also tend to be “rationalists,” believing that outcomes can be weighed in advance by calculating the “expected value” of particular decisions. SBF, for instance, refused haircuts because his nonchalant brand supposedly helped him raise funds. Whether SBF is representative of EA, his conviction will indefinitely tarnish the movement, which is now known more for the fringe beliefs it incubated (like trying to prevent an AI apocalypse) than, say, delivering mosquito nets around the world. Author Zeke Faux referred to it as a philosophy where believers pretend they are superheroes.  Sequoia, VCs and ""Pattern Recognition"": Yesterday, hours after SBF was convicted, Alfred Lin, a partner at VC firm Sequoia Capital and former chief operating officer of Zappos, posted that the company which had invested nearly a quarter billion dollars into FTX, was “deliberately misled and lied to.” He came to this conclusion after an “extensive review” of Sequioa’s due diligence processes over the course of its 18-month relationship with Sam Bankman-Fried, apparently without understanding that, ironically, “due diligence” is supposed to find fraud. Sequoia published an infamous hagiography of SBF at his peak – including details that the FTX CEO was playing “League of Legends” during his pitch meeting and had plans for FTX to become an “everything app” where users could buy anything from stocks to a banana – based on the idea of that he could have become the world’s first “trillionaire.” The VC firm has since written down its investment to $0. While Sequoia has come out looking more foolish than most, the company also stands as an indictment of venture capitalism and the prevalent practice of “pattern matching.” Often when investing in upstarts, there is little information to go on — and so VCs, whether they admit this to themselves or not, go by gut. This is how the world ended up with Adam Neumann, Elizabeth Holmes and Sam Bankman-Fried.  See also: 6 Kinds of Crypto Scams and How to Avoid Them  U.S. Regulators: Although FTX was technically an overseas exchange, SBF made no bones that he ultimately wanted to capture the U.S. market. He helped craft regulation known as the “Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act,” and presented it before Congress and regulators like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. CFTC Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero, who reportedly met SBF three times, has since said this “bespoke regulation” was an attempt to plead “for special treatment” for his “fundamentally predatory model.” U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who knew Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison’s father, is also reported to have had a working relationship with FTX. These agencies are known as “disclosures regulators” in that they attempt to ensure companies are following the law, rather than proactively hunting down crime. Though FTX had grown so large, and had so many connections to the U.S. (including U.S. bank accounts, investments in U.S. firms and U.S. advertising campaigns), without these agencies looking in is a blackmark. It’s telling also, that one of the few FTX units to survive nearly unscathed was FTX Japan, which operated under that country’s stringent financial regulations.  FTX’s Inner Circle: Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang and Nishad Singh all pleaded guilty to fraud charges and cooperated with federal prosecutors. It’s unlikely this conviction could have happened as quickly (or at all) without their testimony. However, they also participated in and facilitated one of the largest financial crimes in history, and it is a mistake to believe SBF acted alone. They waited until the fraud unraveled to speak up, and each ignored numerous opportunities to do the right thing and contact authorities while the looting was taking place. Ellison misled lenders, wrote fraudulent reports and then lied to the public. Wang and Singh made the code changes that enabled the theft. I do not believe prison time will necessarily help any of FTX’s victims, but the value of their testimony will forever be undercut by their earlier silence.  See also: Who's Who in the FTX Inner Circle  Winners  TradFi: Centralized crypto exchanges are essentially TradFi companies, and it turns out that hardwon business practices exist for a reason. Crypto exchanges must separate corporate funds from customer deposits. They nneed to separate their crypto custody and trading divisions. They must provide appropriate disclosures (and no, proof-of-reserves is not enough). Companies need active director’s boards, compliance teams and chief risk officers. It turns out the applecart crypto wants to upset moves slowly for a reason.  Lawyers: FTX is being advised by 150 lawyers from Sullivan & Cromwell, who each reportedly stand to earn as much as $2,165/hour for their work. The bankruptcy estate already has spent more than $110 million in legal fees and recorded over $500,000 in expenses, according to the New York Times. While this seems like money well spent, considering John J. Ray’s aggressive clawback strategy and decision to hold onto lucrative investments like equity in AI startup Anthropic, it is still a massive expense for creditors.  Ian Allison: CoinDesk’s star reporter broke the story that PayPal was getting involved in crypto at the beginning of the bull run and wrote the measured piece about Alameda’s FTT holdings that decidedly ended it. His work has won top financial reporting prizes, including a Polk Award and Loeb Award. But perhaps the most rewarding experience of all was seeing SBF convicted exactly one year to the date after Allison published his story about Alameda’s balance sheet, a seismic impact with little precedent in the history of journalism. Kudos also to former CoinDesker Tracy Wang, who blew the door open on the oddities happening at Sam Bankman-Fried's luxury penthouse at The Albany, which won a Polk Award (without mentioning the word ""polycule"") as well as CoinDesk's ""Trial Team"" who reported the ins and outs of SBF's five-week trial. The Verge's Liz Lopatto; the Ringer's Katie Baker; Protos' Cas Piancey, Bennett Tomlin and David Z. Morris; Wikipedia editor Molly White; Unchained founder Laura Shin and court reporter Matthew Russell Lee of Inner City Press, among others, also provided invaluable insight and commentary from the courthouse.  U.S. Justice System: Several reporters who have spent the past five weeks at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Federal Court in New York have said they are leaving the experience with a newfound respect for the U.S. legal system. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams announced the DOJ’s charges against SBF on Dec. 13, 2022, and less than a year later the trial has concluded and one of the biggest fraudsters in history is behind bars. Judge Lewis Kaplan ran the courtroom as a well-oiled machine, and U.S. prosecutors Danielle Sassoon and Nicolas Roos have emerged as cult heroes for their ability to craft a story and present evidence. Everyone has a right to a fair and speedy trial, and this one — which unfolded in the public eye — was no exception.  Neutral  Solana: [SOL] was one of many so-called ""Sam Coins,"" or tokens that the FTX founder had a massive stake in. Pitched as a super-fast, app-friendly blockchain, Solana's reputation has long been tarnished by its early token sales to venture capitalists and insiders. SBF, for instance, reportedly had an opportunity to buy SOL for around $0.20. He also financed or backed many of the supposedly commercial applications on built on Solana, including the decentralized exchange Serum (another Sam Coin) and the fitness app STEPN. The Solana protocol is still a work in progress, and occasionally goes down, though it boasts one of the most vocal and committed developer communities in crypto. This dev ecosystem got a tepid vote of confidence from Ethereum create Vitalik Buterin, not long after SBF was arrested, and has seemingly been able to shake off the association with FTX. Recently, SOL has been ripping up, though in the longterm there are concerns that the 55.8 million SOL tokens held by the FTX estate will put downward price pressure on the coin for years, as that massive stockpile is liquidated.  See also: Solana (SOL) Price Rallies to 14-Month High as FTX Unstakes Tokens  CoinDesk, the Cadmean Victor: Sorry to get meta again, but what can I say, CoinDesk broke the news about SBF's crooked accounting and brought the multi-billion dollar fraud to light — the type of achievement few media organizations can boast about. Allison's story kickstarted a contagion event that brought down or damaged a number of individuals and firms intertwined with SBF's crypto empire, including CoinDesk's parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) and sister firm Genesis Capital. Suffice it to say that DCG, a crypto conglomerate that was once compared to Standard Oil, is now strapped for cash, and CoinDesk is for sale.

42419191,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE2iz,1699034589,Ex-FTX Unit LedgerX in Gray Area Beyond CFTC Proposal on Customer Funds: Commissioner,"The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) proposed a rule change Friday on how customer funds should be invested by firms the agency oversees – futures commission merchants (FCMs) and derivative clearing organizations (DCOs).  But while crypto derivatives platform LedgerX – the former FTX subsidiary acquired in the bankruptcy by Miami International Holdings, Inc. (MIH) – is a DCO regulated by the agency, it occupies an unusual space as a clearing house that doesn't have FCM members in between itself and the customers, as has been longstanding practice in the industry.  Friday's proposal, which details how regulated firms must only put customer assets into an expanded list of the most liquid of investments, doesn't consider ""the context of a non-intermediated clearing model where the DCO offers direct client access to its clearing services, without the FCM as an intermediary,"" said CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnson.  ""The derivatives market structure is significantly evolving, and it is imperative that the Commission’s regulations evolve in parallel,"" Johnson said.  LedgerX has been bucking tradition, possibly most prominently, when it shook up the industry recently with its aborted push to directly settle margined crypto transactions for customers without intermediaries. The firm holds multiple registrations with the CFTC after agreeing to various special consumer protections, such as segregating assets.  ""Our current regulations do not reach the issues addressed by the conditions in the LedgerX order,"" Johnson said. ""The Commission should consider regulation that closes this gap and ensures parallel retail customer protection for trading through intermediaries and non-intermediated DCOs.""

42419204,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE2wP,1699034579,Prescient Bitcoin Whale Moves $244M in BTC to Crypto Exchange. Has BTC Price Topped?,"A large bitcoin [BTC] investor sent 7,000 bitcoin – worth roughly $244 million – to crypto exchange Bitfinex late Thursday, potentially to realize profits from earlier purchases.  Whales are crypto investors who control large amounts of digital assets. Their crypto purchases and sales may have a sizable impact on markets, thus crypto watchers closely follow their behavior to anticipate market movements. Moving tokens to exchanges usually signals intention to sell, however, blockchain data doesn't show what happens with the tokens once it's at the exchange.  The moves of this whale are of particular note as whoever controls the wallet appears to have a good sense of timing. BitInfoCharts data shows the holder accumulated 46,500 bitcoin between November 2022 and January 2023 at prices under $20,000 per token versus the current price just under $35,000.  The owner then moved to offload a total of 36,500 tokens onto Bitfinex in late March and early April at what was then roughly around the high for the year near $30,000. The holder then took advantage of bitcoin's decline to $26,000 in May to accumulate another 2,000 bitcoin.  Blockchain data shows that those 46,500 bitcoins in March made the wallet the 14th-largest BTC owner globally.  The whale's latest transaction on Thursday is an indication that at least some investors who bought bitcoin at lower prices are on the move to lock in profits after the crypto's spectacular run-up in October from $27,000.  The $35,000 price level has proved to be a key resistance for any upward movement for the last two weeks, with any attempt for a breakout met with heavy sale orders pushing the price back down.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/03/prescient-bitcoin-whale-moves-244m-in-btc-to-crypto-exchange-has-btc-price-topped,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a4349d2f252863642589bc73adc592c364b53e3-3008x1692.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Data from Mintscan shows that current transactions per second (TPS) on Celestia is 0.19. This doesn't necessarily translate to a lack of technical function, but it does mean a lack of activity on the blockchain.  By comparison, Ethereum is currently recording 29.33 TPS, according to data from L2Beat. Arbitrum, another modular blockchain, has been hitting between 35 and 45 TPS on average over the past week.  Around 190,000 users claimed Celestia's airdrops on Tuesday despite more than 600,000 being eligible to do so, leaving slightly less than $1 million in unclaimed value.  Read more: Celestia Airdrops TIA Token as Network Goes Live, Claims Start of 'Modular Era'  The token currently trades at $2.33 with a market cap of $329 million. Daily trading volume peaked at $475 million on Wednesday. It has since dropped to around $170 million, according to CoinMarketCap.  It's worth noting that Celestia's business model is centered around data availability, which is designed to scale Celestia and the entire crypto ecosystem as a whole. Modular blockchains work by creating specific channels for speed and execution, unlike monolithic blockchains.  Despite a slow start in terms of activity, Celestia network validators can currently receive around 23.39% APR as a yield for staking the native TIA token, considerably higher than Ethereum's rate of 3.8%.  The performance of the TIA token has also been impressive compared to the likes of sui [SUI] and aptos [APT], both of which were airdropped to early adopters over the past year, and both endured bitter downturns after being issued. The stability of TIA can be attributed to a low level of inflation, as early investors and core developers have their token allocation locked up until October 2024.

19758109,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559038,1699030829,Ripple Achieves Regulatory Approval To Offer XRP Services,"Ripple grabs yet another achievement with its recent legal and regulatory approval which will basically grant crypto-related firms within the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC) the right to offer XRP services. Latest Approval Sparks Broader XRP Adoption According to a recent announcement, XRP was recently approved under the digital asset regime of the Dubai independent financial services regulatory body within the DIFC, Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). Related Reading: Dubai Watchdog Sounds The Alarm On Crypto Regulatory Blind Spots This achievement appears to be more significant than it seems. This is due to the position held by the DIFC as the top financial center not only in Dubai or the UAE, but also covering a huge territory, including the whole Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (MEASA) region. Additionally, for the past 20 years and counting, the DIFC has been the hub for a variety of financial initiatives, which makes it one of the major locations for companies, investors, and financial institutions in the MEASA area. With this approval, regulated cryptocurrency-focused businesses based in the MEASA region would be able to provide all kinds of cryptocurrency-related services using XRP. These include lending, and trading, among others. Trade and investment within the MEASA region have benefited abundantly from the DIFC’s assistance. This is because it is crucial for connecting MEASA companies and investors with the rest of the globe. Due to this, the financial hub’s legislative lucidity on XRP creates several opportunities for the crypto asset throughout the 72 MEASA member nations. This is a significant achievement because despite XRP already enjoying regulatory clarity in several MEASA nations with pro-crypto laws, it may buttress its notoriety in the area. Thereby introducing the digital asset to a major number of MEASA firms whose headstations are located there. Another reason why the approval is impressive is because a lot of major players in the cryptocurrency ecosystem are from the MEASA region. These include crucial nations like the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and India. As part of the DIFC’s crypto asset regime, XRP has become the first cryptocurrency that the regulatory body authorized legally and regulatoryly through an external application. The digital asset is now the latest addition to other digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC) in the region. However, these other assets were not approved through an external application. India The Leading Player In Cryptocurrency Adoption India being in the MEASA region sparks a wider adoption of XRP as the country has been the top major player in cryptocurrency adoption since 2023. According to an excerpt that was released in September by the New York-based blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, it was revealed that India was leading the charge in terms of grassroots cryptocurrency adoption. In addition, several other countries leading the grassroots crypto adoption appeared to be from the MEASA region, such as Vietnam, Pakistan, and Indonesia.

However, the entire market seems to be taking a breather after this action-packed October that saw Bitcoin, XRP, and Shiba Inu lead impressive rallies. On-chain data, particularly from the crypto analytics platform Santiment, showed October ended on a somehow bearish note. But history from this particular metric suggests that the rally might not be over. XRP And Shiba Inu Rally Not Over The first few days of November appear to be devoid of significant crypto price movement, with the exception of occasional whale transfers. At the time of writing, XRP and SHIB are down by 1% and 2%, respectively, in a 24-hour timeframe. Bitcoin and Ethereum are also down by 2.51% and 1.93% respectively. Some crypto experts attribute this decline to traders taking profit, while others think the crypto market has returned to its normalcy of bearish sentiment. Related Reading: ProShares Goes Short On Ethereum With New ETF Launch Popular crypto analytics platform Santiment predicted this sentiment a few days ago. According to Santiment, the Bullish Vs Bearish Sentiment Keyword turned towards a bearish ratio at the end of October. The metric, which tracks various keyword mentions like “buy,” “sell,” “buying,” “selling,” “topped,” and “bottom” on social media, spent the bulk of October on the bullish end of its range. The firm quickly pointed out that previous instances of higher ratios of bearish keywords had preceded gains in the market caps of popular cryptocurrencies. Aside from Bitcoin, on-chain metrics and fundamental analysis point to a continued rally for XRP and SHIB. These two cryptocurrencies, in particular, have dominated social mentions in the past few months, according to this indicator. 😒 After the trading crowd stayed pretty neutral over the weekend, @santimentfeed data indicates that current sentiment has turned #bearish once again. In the previous instances of higher ratios of negative keywords, #Bitcoin & other market caps rose. 📈https://t.co/2p2uVitBkX pic.twitter.com/0vn3HGC7Gr — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 31, 2023 Altcoins Still Poised For Growth On the fundamental side, XRP has done extremely well, especially as trading resumed on various crypto exchanges. XRP is up by 32% since the beginning of the year, and various analysts have pointed to another price surge. A look into XRP’s price action shows a series of higher low formations since October 30, indicating waning pressure from the bears. XRP is now trading at $0.6036, and the bulls could make another attempt to break over the latest higher high of $0.62 if the price stays above $0.60.

At the same time, on-chain signals point to more bullish than bearish. SHIB whales have resumed large transfers to private wallets, as shown by data from Whale Alerts.

42392141,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg1RfJ,1699025736,What Happens to Bitcoin Price if Spot ETF Isn’t Approved?,"It's not surprising that analysts expect to see negative short-term price action if a bitcoin spot ETF is rejected by the SEC.  Analysts, however, pointed out that bitcoin certainly doesn't hinge its existence on an ETF.  While markets appear to have fully embraced the idea that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot bitcoin ETF (timing unclear), it's worth considering the chance of continued rejections and what that might mean for the price of the crypto.  It's no surprise that analysts believe there would be at least some negative short-term price impact on SEC rejections, but what to expect following the knee-jerk reaction?  “We could see a move downward and the target could be below $30,000,” said Laurent Kssis, a crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital.  Any decline, Kssis noted, would have to be balanced against other bullish catalysts, such as the approaching halving. “A cluster at $25,000 is highly unlikely unless the SEC is categorical, but I sense it will be a back-to-the-drawing-board situation and hope will still be in the back of everyone's mind.”  “If the ETF doesn't get approved, I anticipate it would be a significant letdown for the market,"" said Martin Leinweber, a product strategist at MarketVector Indexes. ""The spot Bitcoin ETF is often viewed as a hallmark of institutional acceptance and integration into mainstream financial systems.""  Leinweber added that a rejection might also trigger some legal turmoil for the SEC, which in June suffered a major court loss when it was ruled the agency was ""arbitrary and capricious"" in its rejection of Grayscale's attempt to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot ETF. The SEC in October notably failed to appeal the ruling, helping to lead to current expectations of coming approvals.  Leinweber notes that bitcoin, as a decentralized entity, certainly doesn't hinge its existence on an ETF, but “a rejection would undeniably cast a bearish shadow on bitcoin’s price in the short term.”  “I believe that the absence of an ETF would impose a substantial drag on the crypto market,"" he said. ""It would necessitate a period of adjustment and realignment, as the market would need to decouple and forge a new narrative moving forward.""  Other crypto assets such as ether [ETH] would likely not be immune to these repercussions, according to Leinweber, especially considering that the SEC would next shift its focus to the spot ether ETF applications.  Bullish action goes beyond ETF  “In the case that a spot ETF isn’t approved soon, we believe Bitcoin’s 2024 investment case remains very strong,"" said Hashdex’s CIO, Samir Kerbage. ""More investors are beginning to appreciate the benefits of bitcoin as a store-of-value asset or type ofdigital gold.”  Kerbage also noted that the next Bitcoin halving is approaching and “if history once again rhymes, the price of BTC will react positively to this scheduled reduction in supply.""  “Regardless of when a spot bitcoin ETF is approved, the outlook for the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency has never been stronger,"" he concluded.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/03/what-happens-to-bitcoin-price-if-spot-etf-isnt-approved,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea6dc7064754944a78fdbff72a541b9ccea974ea-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19755042,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559018,1699023648,Can Dogecoin Rally 135%? Here’s What Needs To Happen,"In a recent analysis, crypto analyst Rekt Capital has pinpointed the signs of a potential breakout in the Dogecoin (DOGE) price, which could pave the way for a significant price rally. However, several factors must come together for this scenario to unfold. Dogecoin Price Ready For A Breakout? Rekt Capital has shared the following 1-week DOGE/USD chart. According to his analysis, Dogecoin’s price movement has been confined within a descending channel pattern since its peak at the end of last year. This pattern is characterized by two parallel trendlines, representing potential support and resistance levels, with the Dogecoin’s price oscillating between them. Last Wednesday, DOGE’s price was rejected once again at the upper trendline, making it the fifth rejection within the last year. However, a key observation made by Rekt Capital is the “buy-the-dip” behavior exhibited by traders, which has so far prevented a strong downside continuation. He highlights: That “buy-the-dip” behavior we saw yesterday is looking like relief under key resistance. However, there has been no strong DOGE rejection & downside continuation. Most important signal is a Weekly Close above Channel Top to confirm a breakout. Related Reading: Dogecoin Poised For A Deep Pullback After Failing To Hold Key Resistance, Analyst As Rekt Capital emphasizes, the most crucial signal for a potential breakout is if Dogecoin can achieve a weekly close above the channel’s top. Therefore, DOGE bulls need to display a strong “buy-the-dip” behavior. Should the price successfully close above the channel top, it could signify a strong bullish trend in the offing. Potential Price Targets Turning to the daily chart of DOGE/USD, several key price targets can be deduced based on Fibonacci retracement levels and Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). The EMAs, which are utilized to pinpoint potential support and resistance levels based on past price data, are showing a cluster around the $0.0660 to $0.0684 range. Currently, DOGE has dropped below the crucial 200-day EMA (blue line) at $0.0684, but found support at 20-day EMA (red line) at $0.0660. If a breakout from the descending trend channel is successful, the 0.236 Fibonacci level at $0.0785 will probably be the first major price target. If DOGE bounces off this level, a retest of the breakout is very likely – it would be a do-or-die moment for Dogecoin. However, a successful retest could pave the way for DOGE to break above the $0.0785 price level and set the stage for the subsequent price targets. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Poised For A Big Leap? ‘Promising’ Indicators To Watch On the higher side, the Fibonacci retracement levels to watch are 0.382 ($0.0938), 0.5 ($0.1062), 0.618 ($0.1186) and 0.786 ($0.1363), which often act as critical resistance and support zones. The ultimate goal of a potential 135% rally would be the November 1 high at $0.1588. In conclusion, while the current market sentiments and patterns hint at a potential breakout, it remains imperative for DOGE to secure a weekly close above the channel top. Should this happen, and coupled with supportive market dynamics, Dogecoin could witness a breathtaking rally once again.

42392138,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg1RPv,1699021800,BitGo and Copper Combine Crypto Custody Settlement Networks,"Cryptocurrency safekeeping firms BitGo and Copper are combining their respective in-custody settlement networks, a way of accessing trading on a growing list of major exchanges without users’ assets leaving the secure confines of cold storage.  The joining up of qualified custodian BitGo’s Go Network with Copper’s popular ClearLoop system will give users access to exchanges such as Bybit, OKX, Powertrade, Bitget, Gate.io, Deribit, BIT, Bitfinex, and Bitstamp.  “We asked the question: do we want to win versus traditional finance?” said Matthew Ballensweig, who leads BitGo’s Go Network. “Can the crypto guys band together to create a true institutional-grade product that has real market scale, as opposed to waiting for Goldman or Fidelity to build out the custody and connectivity infrastructure for the next wave of capital waiting to come into this space.”  Consolidation on the custody front to provide firms and institutions with off-exchange trading of crypto directly from cold storage makes a lot of sense, especially following the collapse of firms like FTX. All that’s been lacking is the scale and network effect, combined with regulated custody. It’s also potentially more efficient for exchanges that have less in the way of integrations with multiple custodians.  It’s a nice fit for the two firms. BitGo, a qualified custodian in the U.S., recently announced it had acquired a crypto custody license from German financial regulator BaFin. Copper closed its enterprise custody business earlier this year to focus on its ClearLoop settlement network, which was launched in 2020 and caters to dozens of institutional firms.  The expansion of the firms’ existing off-exchange settlement networks is currently aimed at non-U.S. users, but the next step will be to roll it out in the U.S., Ballensweig explained in an interview.  “As we add exchanges in the U.S. – for instance, we're working with Bitstamp, and we're talking to a host of other U.S.-based exchanges – our plan is to integrate those,” Ballensweig said. “So that means we can have basically two avenues: one for offshore, that kind of goes through Copper's ClearLoop API, and hits the non-U.S. exchanges, and then one avenue natively through BitGo that touches the US exchanges.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/11/03/bitgo-and-copper-combine-crypto-custody-settlement-networks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c0268cae9f7a0a088e09d8f3de3d29a9779fa6c4-1051x591.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

During the three-day event, speakers, founders, and the community will voice views on the growing sector and the future of the network and blockchain technology as Cardano enters a critical stage in its development. 🎉 Kicking off the Networking Soirée in Dubai! #CardanoSummit2023 pic.twitter.com/6KwkVHSlZo — Cardano Foundation (@Cardano_CF) November 2, 2023 What’s Missing In The Cardano Ecosystem? The Cardano Summit 2023 began with a networking soirée leading to the ‘Battle of the Builders’ competition. The event, sponsored by industry leaders like CV Labs and Genius X, featured ten projects in a pitch contest showcasing the versatility of the Cardano ecosystem. Frederik Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation, highlighted the robust number of Cardano GitHub repositories as evidence of the platform’s readiness for innovation. The number of developers working and shipping products on this blockchain has increased following its implementation of smart contract capabilities. After intense deliberation by a panel of seasoned judges, including Gregaard and representatives from EMURGO and STORM Partners, Maestro claimed the top spot, with NEWM and zkFold rounding out the winner’s circle. The summit continues with more workshops and sessions. Speaking with our team, Sheraz Ahmed, Managing Partner at STORM Partners, gave his perspective on the event, the obstacles of the building during a bear market, the topics dominating the Summit, the key component missing in the ecosystem, and the distinct quality of the Cardano community: passion. STORM has been a long-time partner of Cardano and its ecosystem, aiding them in projects like Ergo Media, marketing, and educational efforts. Ahmed told us: So there are three main topics of the conference. Operational, resilience, education and adoption. Those are the three ones that things are centered towards today’s on the innovation stage. The last discussions are around stablecoins and the importance of stablecoins within the Carano ecosystem. I think a lot of the Cardano community and projects are feeling the pressure of not having a Cardano interoperable (stablecoin). And you can really see that it’s impeding the ability to create DeFi products and applications. Ahmed was one of the judges during the startup competition and saw how the community and the Cardano Foundation leadership leaned towards those projects building stablecoin solutions. In 2024, Ahmed expects Cardano to launch its native stablecoin, which could have major implications for this ecosystem, similar to the “Alonzo” Hard Fork Combinator (HFC) event: So that thing is something (a native stablecoin) that’s just a missing piece of the puzzle that just needs to be filled in the Cardano ecosystem, and that it will be within the next, I’d say by mid next year, it should be the case from what I saw about some of the announcements, some of the discussions, etcetera. So that was the first one. Then education was a big topic this morning because there’s quite a wide community in Cardano. Cardano has quite a widespread community on a variety of different things. I think one topic that wasn’t approached today that was kind of on the tongues of a lot of people in the audience was like, well, “all these things are good, but if we don’t have the funding or the money to do so, how is that going to work out?” And you probably know that the funding of Cardano happens through Catalyst, which is their funding mechanism. And they’ve done 10 funding rounds so far and so the mood at the conference was not bad in terms of the funding round 10, which was I think $5 million just closed a few weeks ago or a month ago. So people are kind of happy or in good sentiment because those that got the approval have money to start building, doing things, etcetera. Because it’d been a year since they hadn’t had a funding round, and that was quite a long time. Normally, the cycles have been at maximum of four to six months. Ultimately, Ahmed believes the Summit marks a major milestone for the Cardano ecosystem as it moves into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Cardano Summit 2023: Founder Hoskinson Speaks Today, the founder of Cardano and CEO at Input Output Global (IOG), Charles Hoskinson, took the main stage to speak about the blockchain’s “Past, Present, and Future.” Using his famous whiteboards, Hoskinson presented the “strategic pillars” underpinning Cardano’s evolution: Scaling, Governance, and Interoperability. Whiteboard session with @IOHK_Charles about #Cardano: Past, Present and Future 🖖#CardanoSummit2023 pic.twitter.com/VXLOaLbc7i — Romain Pellerin (@rom1_pellerin) November 3, 2023 In addition, Hoskinson outlined upcoming enhancements like Hydra for scaling and governance tools like 1694 and Intersect, emphasizing the network’s direction towards self-amendment capabilities. For interoperability, the Cardano founder cited advances with sidechains and the implementation of Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NiPoPoWs). Hoskinson introduced the Cardano Settlement Layer (CASL) as a mainnet foundation for service layers, alongside PartnerChains for service layer collaboration, leveraging Minotaur’s consensus algorithm for cross-consensus interoperability. The framework will utilize Parity Substrate with Babel fees, enabling native asset transactions.

Association Set To Dissolve, 86,000 ETH Up For Grabs","Swiss non-profit Aragon Association has announced its dissolution, offering users the opportunity to redeem its native token, ANT, for ETH (Ethereum). This strategic move marks a crucial shift in the organization’s path and aims to address challenges that have arisen in recent times. As part of this dissolution process, ANT token holders will have a one-year window to redeem their tokens. The association will deploy a total of 86,343 Ether into a redemption contract, offering a redemption rate of 0.0025376 Ether per ANT, according to a statement released on Thursday. This initiative is designed to provide a fair and efficient way for ANT holders to transition from their existing tokens into Ethereum. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Are Charging – Could $50 Be Just Around The Corner? Aragon’s Financial Provisions And Future Plans To ensure a smooth dissolution process and mitigate potential regulatory uncertainties, the Aragon Association will retain $11 million in funds. These funds will be earmarked to cover any outstanding costs related to the dissolution and to serve as a safeguard against unforeseen regulatory challenges. In the event that unused funds remain after the dissolution, they will be directed towards a “product-focused structure,” signifying the association’s commitment to continuing its mission. We have an important update for all stakeholders of the @AragonProject. We passed a resolution to: – Deploy most of the treasury to allow all ANT holders to redeem their ANT for ETH – Dissolve the AA – Continue the mission in a product-focused structurehttps://t.co/S0GjRtzhZJ — Aragon Association (@AragonAssoc) November 2, 2023 The Aragon Association cited several challenges that have led to this decision, including bureaucratic complexity, misaligned stakeholder interests, and unsuccessful attempts to modify governance structures. The organization attempted to rescue itself through a hurried endeavor to place control of the treasury directly in the hands of ANT holders. However, the association encountered a significant discrepancy between the value of the treasury and the token market cap, preventing the success of this approach. Faced with these complexities, the association made the difficult choice to return funds to investors and formally dissolve. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s 108% YTD Surge Highlights Crypto’s Growing Prominence ANTUSD currently trading at $4.55 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Aragon’s Innovative Contributions Aragon is renowned for its groundbreaking contributions to the blockchain ecosystem. It has developed aragonOS, a set of developer tools that empower users to create decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) seamlessly. Furthermore, the Aragon App, a product of the association, allows developers to create DAOs without the need for extensive coding expertise. Token Redemption Timeline Users who hold ANT tokens will have until November 2, 2024, to take advantage of the redemption program. Following the completion of the redemption process, all ANT tokens will be permanently removed from circulation. As the association emphasized, there will be no further purpose in holding ANT tokens beyond this point. The Aragon Association’s decision to dissolve itself and provide a redemption program for ANT token holders reflects its commitment to addressing challenges and maintaining the project’s integrity. This strategic move ensures a transparent and fair transition for users, while preserving the organization’s mission to foster innovation in the blockchain space.

The scam lures victims into connecting their WhatsApp account to a fake phishing website via a QR code, secretly granting access to the website owner.  Phishing scams are widespread across the cryptocurrency sector, as it's easy for hackers to transfer funds under a veil of anonymity. It was reported last week that users of LastPass, a platform that encrypts and stores passwords, lost $4.4 million in a single day after the software's cloud platform was breached last year.  Another reason why cryptocurrency users are targeted is because transactions are irreversible, meaning that once hackers secure access to a user's private key, it is almost impossible to recover the assets in that wallet.  Yahoo Finance reported that Singaporean actress Aileen Tan was targeted by the WhatsApp scam. Hackers used her credentials to ask her husband to transfer money to a bank account in Hong Kong.

42392144,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg1Ruh,1699018886,"Cubist, Led by Computer Science Professors, Releases Wallet-as-a-Service 'CubeSigner'","Cubist, a blockchain startup co-founded by computer science professors at Carnegie Mellon University and University of California San Diego and a former fintech chief operating officer and security expert, publicly released a new ""wallet-as-a-service"" product, aiming to solve the challenge of making account keys readily available while keeping them secure.  The product, CubeSigner, ""lets users request signatures through revocable signing sessions instead of giving direct access to raw keys,"" according to a press release Wednesday. ""Users can’t accidentally leak their keys, and attackers can’t steal keys because key material stays locked in secure hardware, both during generation and signing.""  CubeSigner as a product was released earlier this year and is already in production as a key manager for Ethereum validators, according to the press release. The project's website details a collaboration with another startup, Ankr, in the arena of liquid staking.  The import of the latest announcement is that CubeSigner is now being rolled out to other blockchains and projects.  Co-founder and CEO Riad Wahby, who's also an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon, told CoinDesk that the new CubeSigner wallet-as-a-service was designed to be configurable for any blockchain, including Bitcoin, Solana and Avalanche, in addition to Ethereum.  ""One of the really nice advantages of the architecture is that we're super flexible,"" Wahby said.  The new wallet could compete with existing wallet-as-a-service providers, such as Fireblocks, Coinbase, Magic.link and Privy.  The goal is to make it easy for developers of blockchain-based applications to offer their wallets to end users without having to build the wallets themselves.  The problem of secure key management has grown more complicated as the industry has expanded, with new blockchain networks proliferating and all the while, crypto players are becoming more institutional.  A differentiator for CubeSigner, according to Wahby, is its ""anti-slashing"" features, designed to automatically avoid the sort of errors and faults that might lead to blockchain validators getting penalized under the rules of a crypto-staking protocol like Ethereum.  In March, Cubist raised $7 million in a seed round led by Polychain Capital with investors including dao5, Amplify Partners, Polygon, Blizzard and Axelar.  Cubist's first offering was a software toolkit designed to help users write cross-chain applications.  Wahby said the company pivoted to focus on CubeSigner based on feedback from prospective clients for that initial product.  ""As we started socializing it to customers, we started hearing, 'The thing that actually keeps me up at night is X,' and X was always, 'We can't manage our keys,'"" Wahby said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | SPONSORED,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/11/01/cubist-led-by-computer-science-professors-releases-wallet-as-a-service-cubesigner,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e4925765769518f3d72a5fb440c05e780f766a4-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19752089,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558967,1699016449,Legal Expert Explains Why Ripple Will Always Back XRP,"A pro-XRP lawyer known for advocating for the cryptocurrency has outlined reasons why he believes Ripple would not abandon the XRP token. Lawyer Proclaims That Ripple Is Committed To XRP Pro-XRP lawyer and Managing Partner of the Deaton Firm, John E. Deaton has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to assuage concerns raised about Ripple’s commitment and plans for the XRP token. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Rally Threatened As Exchange Drops BCH Following XRP Listing Rumors Following the recent announcement of XRP’s expansion into Dubai after gaining approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), Deaton boldly stated in his post that Ripple was not planning to ditch the XRP token and would not be for years. He said that the crypto payments network had a strong financial responsibility to the token, having invested billions in XRP. “As I’ve said for more than 3 years, Ripple is not going to abandon XRP. It has a fiduciary duty not to,” Deaton stated. Deaton highlighted Ripple’s financial journey revolving around the XRP token. He stated that in its Series A funding in 2015, Ripple was valued at $128 million. In Series B, the crypto payments network’s value rose again in the following year to $410 million and by 2020, Ripple had attained a value of $10 billion in its Series C valuation. Deaton also mentioned Ripple’s Series C buyback valuation last year, which saw the crypto network purchasing its Series C shares at a 50% higher price. According to Deaton, Ripple’s growing value and large-scale investments regarding XRP are proof enough that the crypto network would continue its support for XRP. The pro-XRP lawyer disclosed that Ripple owned $48 billion to $50 billion worth of XRP, which makes it inconceivable for the crypto network to abandon XRP. He also stated that Ripple has more to gain than lose, especially if the XRP token price surges to $2. “Ripple’s pre-IPO shares clearly trade at a valuation significantly less than $15B. Owning 48B-50B XRP makes it insane to abandon XRP. If #XRP reaches $2, Ripple has an asset valued at $100B,” Deaton stated. Token price holds $0.6 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com XRP Enthusiast Question Price Standstill After Major Milestones While many XRP community members have commemorated the recent successes in the XRP ecosystem, an XRP enthusiast has chosen to voice out concerns about the lingering question of why the price of XRP has not been affected by its new achievements. XRP Cryptowolf took to X on Thursday to publish XRP’s newest development of partnering with the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) and why the token has not shown any significant price surges following the announcement. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales Are Moving SHIB Again, Bearish Or Bullish? “Anyone else wondering why $XRP didn’t skyrocket to the news of Ripple partnering with a central bank?” XRP Cryptowolf stated. Additionally, following John Deaton’s statement that Ripple would not abandon the XRP token, an XRP community member disclosed that the XRP token had shown only a slight price change when a larger surge was expected. “And yet here we are up 3 pennies haha any other coin would have jumped $15 bucks in a day with this kind of news,” an XRP community member stated. While the present price of XRP has displayed a slower price growth than its past, many crypto enthusiasts believe that the cryptocurrency’s ongoing legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been the primary source of its growth stunt. In response to XRP Cryptowolf’s question about the slack in the price of XRP, a community member stated that “for XRP to truly be free and demonstrate its potential, it will only happen after it clears all the SEC lawsuits.” Featured image from StormGain, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,BCH | XRP,BCH | ICO | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/legal-expert-ripple-xrp/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/19752089.jpeg

The unemployment rate rose to 3.9% versus forecasts for 3.8% and September’s 3.8%.  In addition to the headline miss, downward revisions to August's and September's jobs gains totaled 101,000.  Bitcoin [BTC] remained lower on the session in the immediate aftermath of the release at $34,300.  Checking other report details, average hourly earnings were 0.2% higher in October, shy of estimates for 0.3% and September's 0.3%. On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings rose 4.1% versus 4.0% expected and 4.3% in September.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Sam Bankman-Fried defrauded his customers and lenders, a New York jury found after a five-week trial for the FTX founder and former chief executive. A tentative sentencing date was set for March 28, 2024. Bankman-Fried could spend decades in prison (and theoretically up to 115 years). ""Sam Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said outside the courthouse after the guilty verdicts on all seven charges were revealed. ""This kind of fraud, this kind of corruption is as old as time. We have no patience for it.""  Coinbase (COIN) topped analyst estimates for the third quarter on earnings and revenue, while falling short in total trading volume expectations. The crypto exchange reported a third-quarter adjusted loss of $0.01 per share, compared with FactSet estimates for a loss of $0.55 per share, marking the third consecutive earnings beat for Coinbase. Total revenue for the quarter was $674.1 million, beating estimates of $650.9 million. Total trading volume, however, was just $76 billion, less than the $80.1 billion estimate and down from $92 billion in the previous quarter. Transaction revenue was $288.6 million, 12% less than in the previous quarter.  Alongside its third-quarter earnings report, software developer MicroStrategy (MSTR) disclosed the purchase of another 155 bitcoins (BTC) during October, bringing the total acquired since the beginning of Q3 to 6,607. As of the end of October, the Tysons, Virginia-headquartered firm co-founded by Michael Saylor was the owner of 158,400 bitcoins acquired at a total cost of $4.69 billion, or $29,586 per bitcoin. The company booked an impairment loss on its digital asset holdings of $33.6 million during Q3. Cumulative impairment losses have now risen to $2.23 billion, reflecting an average carrying amount per bitcoin of roughly $15,491. That, of course, isn't terribly reflective of the market value as of Sept. 30 of the company's bitcoin, which was $27,030, nor the current price of just under $35,000.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's price and the ratio between open interest in the perpetual swaps market and the cryptocurrency's market capitalization since March 2020.  While bitcoin's price has surged by over 25% in four weeks, the ratio remains near its yearly lows, indicating a tepid demand for leveraged products.  It's a sign of a spot-led price rally.

42392149,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg1SFD,1699012005,Bitcoin Recedes to $34.2K Ahead of U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls Data,"Bitcoin [BTC] is on the back foot ahead of the key U.S. data release, which could bring pain to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  At press time, bitcoin was changing hands at $34,235, representing a 2% drop on the day, CoinDesk data show. Prices briefly topped the $36,000 mark early this week, extending past week’s 15% surge from near $30,000.  At 12:30 UTC, the U.S. Labor Department will release nonfarm payrolls data, which is expected to show the world’s largest economy added 180,000 jobs in October, marking a sharp slowdown from September’s 336,000 additions.  The jobless rate is forecast to hold steady at 3.8%, while the year-on-year growth in average hourly earnings likely slowed to 4% from 4.2%.  Per Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, better-than-expected jobs data may weigh over risk assets.  “Good data is bad for markets – The overly eager dovish interpretation of Powell’s comments heightens the risk around an upside surprise for today’s NFP data. A soft jobs data will probably propel markets higher,” Solot said in X.  The Federal Reserve held the benchmark borrowing cost unchanged at 5.25% early this week while explicitly mentioning that tighter financial and credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation.  That has convinced markets that the Fed’s tightening cycle has ended, and the next move will likely be a rate cut. The Fed started its tightening cycle in March last year and has since raised rates by 525 basis points. The rapid-fire rate hikes were partly responsible for the last year's crypto crash.  A better-than-expected jobs figure may dent the dovish conviction, boosting the dollar index and adding downside pressures around bitcoin.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/03/bitcoin-recedes-to-342k-ahead-of-us-nonfarm-payrolls-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a01b0bec73ed915b2f0e762ef81dbba94dfba099-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19750045,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558981,1699011614,Bitcoin Price Rally Was Not ETF-Driven: QCP Reveals Main Reason,"In their latest market update, QCP Capital, a crypto asset trading firm headquartered in Singapore, has dissected the recent Bitcoin price movements, attributing the rally to macroeconomic factors rather than the much-anticipated approval of a spot ETF. To recall, the Bitcoin surged from $34,500 to almost $36,000 on Wednesday. The Main Reason For The Bitcoin Price Rally The firm’s technical analysis highlighted that Bitcoin reached the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $35,912 and touched the upper channel trendline before retreating, a move that was keenly observed by market participants. QCP Capital’s report states, “This latest rally, however, was less about spot ETF developments and more about macro forces.” These macro forces were identified following a dovish stance from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and a smaller than expected Treasury Q1 supply estimate, which led to a significant drop in bond yields. This, in turn, has had a bullish effect on risk assets, including Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Analyst Raises Red Flag On Bitcoin Rally, Predicts Imminent Retreat After 35% Spike However, the firm also had a word of caution, saying, “Whether this marks the start of a new global equity and bond uptrend remains to be seen, as the macro picture essentially remains unchanged, outside a correction of overly bearish bond sentiment.” The firm also noted the Bitcoin derivatives market, where “perp funding, and term forwards, implied volatility and risk reversals across the curve continue to remain or extend further at extreme elevated levels.” This suggests a market bracing for a significant move, with derivative traders positioned for a potential upside breakout that hinges on the approval of a spot ETF. Looking at the broader financial landscape, the bond market has been experiencing notable fluctuations. Recently, the 30-year Treasury yield has reached another 16-year high, climbing above 5%. This level of yield has not been seen since 2007, and it represents a rise of over 4 percentage points in just three years. Such movements in the bond market are critical for the Bitcoin and crypto market as they affect the risk sentiment among investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s 108% YTD Surge Highlights Crypto’s Growing Prominence However, Bitcoin is currently following the example of gold as a safe haven asset. ”The market is starting to price in the Fed’s overtightening and weakening economics. Combined with geopolitical tensions + war, the need for QE in the future is increasing rapidly. This is causing insurance assets (Gold, Bitcoin) to absolutely rip in unison,” Carpriole Investment’s Charles Edwards remarked recently. In summary, QCP Capital’s insights into Bitcoin market dynamics versus current bond market trends suggest that while the Bitcoin market is influenced by a variety of factors, including speculation about exchange-traded fund approval, macroeconomic indicators such as bond yields play a larger role in determining market sentiment and price action than other pundits believe. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $34,235 and at risk of breaking out of the established uptrend channel to the downside. If that happens, low price levels could come next.

42392154,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg1Ser,1699009379,"Bitcoin Is Up 70% a Year After FTX Debacle, but 'Alameda Gap' in Liquidity Persists","On Nov. 2, 2022, CoinDesk published an award-winning story, setting in motion a chain of events that led to the quick collapse of the now-convicted Sam Bankman Fried's FTX crypto exchange, formerly the world's third largest, and its sister concern, Alameda Research.  Bitcoin [BTC], the largest cryptocurrency by market value, bottomed out in the same month. It has since rallied 70% to $34,300. However, scars from the collapse of FTX and Alameda are still evident in the form of weak liquidity and market depth, which is the market's ability to absorb large orders at stable prices.  The combined 2% market depth for bitcoin, ether [ETH], and the top 30 alternative cryptocurrencies by market value is currently $800 million, 55% lower than a year ago, Dessislava Aubert, research analyst at Paris-based Kaiko, said in an email.  In other words, a year ago, it would have taken an order worth at least $1.8 billion to move prices 2% in either direction. Currently, an order of $800 million is enough to influence prices.  The substantial deterioration in liquidity, referred to as the Alameda Gap by Kaiko, means higher slippage costs for traders looking to execute large orders.

Weak liquidity also means a few large orders can have an outsized impact on prices and breed price volatility.

Prosecutors presented evidence and testimony showing that SBF had siphoned billions of customer deposits and doctored balance sheets at FTX to bankroll speculative investments, donate millions of dollars in political contributions, and cover major losses at sister hedge fund Alameda Research. While an appeal is likely, SBF now faces decades behind bars, with Judge Lewis Kaplan setting a sentencing date for March 28, 2024 (SBF also faces a second trial earlier that month). Quote: ""Sam Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, whose office led the investigation, said at a press conference outside the courthouse. ""The cryptocurrency industry might be new; the players like Sam Bankman-Fried might be new, but this kind of fraud, this kind of corruption, is as old as time, and we have no patience for it. It's a warning to every single fraudster out there who thinks that they're untouchable, or that their crimes are too complex for us to catch, or that they're too powerful for us to prosecute."" Since his arrest in December, the former billionaire has maintained his innocence, claiming that unfortunate management mistakes, not criminal activity, were tied to the downfall of FTX. Earlier this month, three of Bankman-Fried's business affiliates told the jury that he posted, or had influenced others to post, misleading messages on social media to falsely represent the health of FTX in an effort to put an end to a deposit run. All three witnesses also agreed to cooperate with prosecutors after pleading guilty to fraud and other offenses. What it means for crypto: The knee-jerk reaction saw benchmark cryptocurrency Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) lose $1,000 in value since the SBF verdict was released to trade at the $34,000 level, but the losses were mostly contained. Interestingly enough, the collapse of FTX in November 2022 came after crypto hit its lowest point over the past three years, which was mainly due to the Fed's rate-hiking cycle and its impact on high-risk assets. Since SBF was arrested that December, things have actually been on the upswing, with Bitcoin even climbing 105% YTD and making crypto one of the best investment classes of 2023. Go deeper: While the SEC and other agencies have expanded their crackdowns , like suing Coinbase ( COIN ) this past summer , the push for more regulation and enforcement could benefit investors by defining legal parameters and legitimizing the industry. There are also increased hopes for new spot bitcoin ETFs , which have been filed by several major financial firms. including Blackrock ( BLK ), and could draw in institutional players while keeping traders bullish. In the words of Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos, who said in his closing statement before the jury, the SBF trial was ""not about complicated crypto,"" but rather about ""deception, lies, stealing and greed.""

Furthermore, TechDev underlines Bitcoin’s historical breakouts against the NASDAQ over the years, emphasizing the significance of these breakthrough moments. These instances serve as a strong indication for investors, signaling the importance of not overlooking Bitcoin’s potential to break out significantly against the renowned stock exchange.

42392139,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg1RV3,1699005600,"'Unanimous Verdict, Your Honor': Sam Bankman-Fried's Conviction Was Inevitable","Sam Bankman-Fried is guilty.  Twelve jurors spent less than five hours deciding the facts. They asked for portions of transcripts from Paradigm's Matt Huang and Third Point's Robert Boroujerdi testimony, as well as highlighters and Post-it Notes, and when they didn't immediately receive the version of the indictment, they requested that too.  And yet, they quickly decided that Bankman-Fried was guilty on all seven counts. He defrauded FTX's customers and conspired to defraud them. He defrauded Alameda Research's lenders and conspired to defraud them. He conspired to defraud FTX's investors and customers and to conceal the proceeds by laundering funds.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  The outcome seemed inevitable. The U.S. Department of Justice had a fully fleshed out case, while the defense – as we've said for weeks – seemed to struggle. Judge Lewis Kaplan visibly appeared to lose his patience with the defendant (though he said Thursday he wouldn't share any personal views on the verdict). I wasn't personally in the courtroom when Bankman-Fried testified, nor when defense attorney Mark Cohen gave his closing. But my colleagues who were say that some of the jurors looked at the clock during the closing argument. Bankman-Fried's inability to answer certain questions – and I say inability in the sense that if he acknowledged some of AUSA Danielle Sasoon's questions, he'd open himself to follow-ups, and if he denied them, he'd open himself to claims of lying – don't seem to have endeared him to anyone. His particular speaking style – trying to answer the question he hoped he'd be asked – sparked admonitions from the judge.  The case isn't over. A sentencing hearing has been tentatively scheduled for next March. And Bankman-Fried faces another trial on additional charges around the same time.  And, as the court prepared to disperse Thursday, defense attorney Cohen asked about post-trial motions (he has a few weeks). We'll almost certainly see an appeal.  But as I said, this outcome seemed inevitable. The judge decided to keep the jury around until 8 p.m., instead of ending the day at 4:30 p.m. as usual. The court clerk announced a verdict was reached at 7:38.  Everyone was in the courtroom for the verdict – the overflow room was closed. So we all watched the jurors file in. We saw the court clerk show the judge the verdict form, hand the foreperson (juror 4) a microphone, ask her for the verdict on each count and poll each juror to confirm the decision was unanimous.  Sam, the defendant, Bankman-Fried – whatever you want to call him – had to watch her read out the decision. She didn't look at him while reading the verdict. By 7:55, it was all over.  After she sat down, you could just hear the court sketch artist for a second. Judge Kaplan thanked the jurors for their service, telling them being on a jury is a ""privilege of citizenship.""  And then, after dismissing the 12 women and men, the judge returned to business, asking about sentencing hearings and a second trial on additional charges set for March. We're on to the next one.  — Nikhilesh De  Courtroom scenes  Fewer than 30 people showed up before 9:00 a.m., but the court was packed by the time we got to the verdict.  Judge Lewis Kaplan read the jury charge over the course of a few hours after AUSA Danielle Sassoon finished her rebuttal argument. Before he began, the court's deputy clerk announced that everyone in the courtroom would have to remain seated before instructing the U.S. Marshal to ""please lock the door.""  The press pool all had pizza in the cafeteria for dinner (shout-out to the cafeteria staff for not only baking us pizzas, but letting us stay past closing during what was already a long day!).  — Nikhilesh De  Editor's notes  I want to take a moment to just contemplate something. Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of serious financial crimes. He left thousands of victims, some of whom are still hoping for anything back that they can get back. He's looking at potentially decades behind bars. Based on the testimony and evidence we've heard and seen over the past month, he was an active and willing participant in the crimes he was convicted of, and his role as a truthful person who made mistakes is suspect.  All that being said, it is worth acknowledging that what this means is he's going to spend a decade or few isolated from society at large. If he's released early or after the conclusion of his sentence, he'll be dropped into a world different from the one he left. A decade ago bitcoin was worth pennies on the dollar compared to today, and this entire industry I spend my time covering barely existed. Smartphones were relatively infant, people used massive desktop computers instead of tablets and there were around a billion fewer people on this planet. I'm not saying people should feel sorry for Bankman-Fried or sympathetic toward his immediate future. But it's still worth acknowledging.  And finally, a note about this newsletter. Danny, Sam, Helene, Liz and I have a month's worth of notes and quirks that didn't quite fit into the normal, everyday coverage. Over the next few days or weeks, we'll start sharing those. In the meantime, I also want to make sure that you have the opportunity to ask any questions you have, whether they're about the trial and court proceedings, the next steps, even just some aspect of what it was like inside the building where it all happened.

ProShares Short Ethereum Strategy ETF In its announcement, the asset manager mentioned that the ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF trading under the ticker ‘SETH’ will provide an avenue for investors to profit from declines in the price of the second largest cryptocurrency, Ether. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales Are Moving SHIB Again, Bearish Or Bullish? With the launch of this Ethereum investment vehicle, the company believes that its clients have an opportunity to “profit both on days when Ether increases and when it drops.” It is worth mentioning that the asset manager was one of those who recently launched their Ethereum futures ETF, offering investors the chance to bet on the prices of the crypto token. The Asset manager mentioned that the Short Ether Strategy ETF will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and will deliver the opposite of the daily performance of the S&P CME Ether Futures Index. As to exposure, SETH, like other ProShares crypto-related ETFs, will gain exposure through Ether futures contracts. ETH price falls below $1,800 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com How ProShares Has Blazed The Trail So Far ProShares is no newcomer when it comes to offering crypto-related ETFs and can even be said to be a trailblazer in that regard. The firm was the first to launch a Bitcoin futures ETF and the first US Bitcoin-linked ETF (ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF) back in 2021. It also launched the first US short Bitcoin-Linked ETF (ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF) in June 2022. Similar to the SETH, the Short Bitcoin Strategy provides investors an avenue to make profits off declines in the price of the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.

Other crypto-linked ETFs offered by the firm include ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), which is said to be “the first US ETF that targets the performance of Ether,” and the Bitcoin & Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF and Bitcoin & Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF which tracks both the performance of Bitcoin and Ether. Considering how bullish the firm seems to be on crypto-related ETFs, it is surprising that it isn’t part of the asset managers that have filed to offer a Spot Bitcoin ETF.

Expert Eyes 1,500% Rally Signal From Past","Crypto analyst Egrag recently delved into the XRP price charts and spotlighted signs that suggest a possible rally of more than 1,500% is on the horizon. The focus of this analysis is the ASO (Average Sentiment Oscillator), a metric that traders employ to determine market sentiment. XRP Price Rally Of 1,500%+ Ahead? Egrag’s monthly XRP/USD chart showcases the convergence of the blue line, symbolizing bulls, and the red line, representing bears. A month ago, Egrag had marked a yellow box on his chart, predicting the bullish crossover to take place between the end of 2023 or the onset of the latter half of 2024. Today, Egrag noted, “XRP ASO Update: The journey is only heading UP! I’ve been eagerly awaiting the bullish crossover of the ASO since February 2023. And guess what? It’s finally here!” Should XRP mimic its historical patterns, and if Egrag’s predictions hold true, the XRP price might witness some considerable price movements in the coming months. Related Reading: Ripple Transfers 800 Million XRP Back To Escrow: Catalyst For Price Rally? Historically, the cryptocurrency experienced this bullish crossover twice before. The 2017 event led to a staggering 55,000% increase in XRP’s price, while the one from late 2020 to April 2021 resulted in a 1,500% appreciation. Given the “largest jaw” ever observed on the chart, Egrag has sparked discussions suggesting that the forthcoming rally could even outpace its predecessors. By connecting the dots from the historical data and the recent crossover, Egrag further elaborated, “Looking at historical data, we can see that it typically takes around 275 days to reach the peak after this event.” If XRP follows its historical trends, as Egrag suggests, the XRP price might be gearing up for some substantial price action within the next 7-10 months. Related Reading: XRP Ledger Market Cap Soars On Regulatory Success: 59% YTD Growth Achieved Ending his tweet on a rallying note for the vast community of supporters, commonly referred to as the ‘XRP Army’, Egrag encouraged, STAY STEADY and keep on wearing your space suit.” To provide more context, the ASO acts as a momentum oscillator, giving averaged percentages of bull/bear sentiment. It’s particularly potent in discerning sentiment during specific candle periods, assisting in trend identification or pinpointing entry/exit moments. The tool was conceived by Benjamin Joshua Nash and modified from its MT4 version. The oscillator’s design, showcasing Bulls % with a blue line and Bears % with a red line, illuminates the prevailing sentiment in the market. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5990. Upon examining the 1-day chart, it’s evident that the XRP price faced a second rejection at the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, which stands at $0.625. Although the RSI has settled somewhat, it remains elevated in the overbought zone at 71. This suggests that the price might gear up for another shot at overcoming this resistance. However, if it doesn’t succeed, a pullback to the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level, priced at $0.553, may be on the horizon. On the upside, the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level, pegged at $0.683, represents the next potential price target.

Since Oct. 25, SOL’s cumulative volume delta (CVD) has increased by nearly $1 million on Coinbase, indicating net capital inflows. CVD on Binance and Kraken turned positive early this week, while on the South Korean exchange Upbit, it has been negative and trending south for two weeks.  The CVD metric tracks the net difference between buying and selling volumes over time. It’s a running total of net bullish/bearish pressures in the market, with positive values indicating an excess of purchase volume. Negative values suggest otherwise.  According to Kaiko analyst, Riyad Carey, the median order size on Coinbase has been more significant than other exchanges, perhaps a sign of institutions bidding for SOL through the Nasdaq-listed exchange.  Coinbase’s leadership in the SOL market comes after VanEck, a multi-billion dollar institutional asset manager, published a report detailing a bullish case scenario that could take the cryptocurrency’s price as high as $3,200 by 2030.  The bullish prediction is based on a potential scenario where Solana becomes the first blockchain to accommodate applications with over 100 million users.  That said, SOL’s recent price gains have yet to galvanize on-chain activity.

We assume SOL monetizes at only 20% of ETH's take rate and achieves less than half of ETH's market shares due to a fundamental difference in community philosophy. We see a credible path to $8B in revenues for SOL token holders by 2030. By 2030, our Solana valuation scenarios project a SOL price ranging from a bearish $9.81 to a bullish $3,211.28, anchored by varied market shares and revenue estimations across key sectors. Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. The purpose of smart contract platforms (SCPs) is to host applications that offer their users the ability to engage in efficient, uncensorable economic activity while minimizing rent extraction on those economic activities by third parties. While many blockchains exist today, the user base of all blockchains is tiny compared to those who engage in commerce off-chain. Roughly 5.5M unique addresses are active each day on SCPs, and around 44M each month. However, it is likely these figures dramatically overstate usership because many users control multiple addresses. Even if we take them at face value, these figures compare poorly to the 2B users who interact with Facebook ( META ) each day and the 431M who use PayPal ( PYPL ) every month. The reason why blockchain adoption hasn't been faster already is because blockchains are clunky to use, and there is little to do on the chain besides exchange value and speculation. For crypto to achieve widespread adoption and grow its $1.3T market cap, it needs to have a so-what for people and businesses who are not decentralization maxis or libertarian zealots. It needs a killer application. And the chain that hosts that killer application stands to benefit immensely from the activity generated by that app. In this note, we model a scenario in which Solana ( SOL-USD ) is the first blockchain to host a single application that onboards 100M+ users. Monthly Active Users of SCPs Source: Token Terminal, Dune, as of 10/25/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Solana's potential begins with its founding team's success in blending radical experimentation with applied science to monumentally improve blockchain scaling. While other chains have chosen scaling paths that cleverly circumnavigate the limitations of distributed ledgers, Solana has instead chosen to push to the limits of technological feasibility problems and work backward from there. The Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ecosystem and many others have chosen a modular vision where different blockchains specialize in the core functions of a layer 1 chain. On the other hand, Solana has plowed ahead, trying to wring greater transaction throughput by optimizing every component of its own blockchain to be hyper-efficient. Consequently, Solana is vastly more capable than any of its legacy competitors regarding blockchain processing capabilities. Parallel to this, but much more importantly, Solana has translated its pioneering spirit into an ecosystem philosophy of risk-taking and techno-optimism. Solana has spawned a variety of fascinating experiments that include blockchain-optimized mobile phones, NFTs that contain applications, and consumer-focused products like decentralized mapping and automobile data collection. More so than any other ecosystem, people building projects in Solana are creating things that may provide a tangible impact on everyday life. Solana's Approach: Usability The probability of a blockchain network hosting the next ""killer apps"" hinges upon that chain's ability to make using that application fast, convenient, and accessible. The more capable the blockchain, the better the environment for a user. The key question is measuring blockchain ability and understanding how that translates into useability. A popular metric, transactions per second ((TPS)), is an inadequate measurement that is easily manipulated. Realistically, blockchain teams can improve this metric by many tricks, including changing the amount of data each transaction contains, forgoing the ordering of transactions, and limiting what parts of a ledger a transaction can change. In fact, the best metric to truly measure blockchain capacity is not transactions per second ((TPS)) but is instead data throughput. Data throughput involves a blockchain ingesting, processing, and ordering data and then agreeing on that data's impact on the blockchain's ledger. Data throughput is determined by measuring the amount of data that can be received and applied by a blockchain over a given time period. The more data a blockchain can translate into ledger updates over a time increment, the better. As it stands, Solana's data throughput exceeds that of any other blockchain in existence. In fact, Solana's data capacity exceeds that of most planned blockchains, and Solana's next significant software upgrade called the Firedancer upgrade, promises to exceed Solana's current capacity by a factor of 10. While we do not pretend to know how much data the next killer application's blockchain needs to ingest and process, we imagine that 100M+ users doing anything on-chain will push blockchain scalability to its limits. Data Throughput Comparisons MB/S Source: Frictionless Capital, SCP Home Pages as of 10/25/2023. Solana translates this data throughput capability into solving problems that users care about. Solana enables quicker feedback to the user than most other chains because it offers continuous processing of transactions. For example, Ethereum works by pooling incoming transactions from users in essentially a waiting room called the mempool. Ethereum validators (block builders in the new paradigm) then pick transactions from the pool based on the price offered by each transaction and order them. Every 12 seconds, transactions are then executed, and the block containing the transactions is beamed to the rest of the Ethereum network. Consequently, Ethereum processes transactions at discrete intervals. This is a substantially slower way of processing transactions than Solana's which leads to longer wait times for the user. On Ethereum, users must wait for this entire process to unfold before they know their transaction is complete. Often, this is measured in minutes. Solana, by contrast, begins working on processing the transaction instantly, and the turnaround is approximately 2 seconds. Apps on Solana To make the user experience even better, Solana has also created a novel feature called Local Fee Markets. If a blockchain is a data pipeline from users to the blockchain's ledger, Solana's Local Fee Markets are essentially internal sub-pipelines that allow information to flow from different users to multiple parts of the ledger simultaneously. This solves a core problem of Ethereum and other blockchains, as overuse of one application on Ethereum's pipeline slows down all other applications. For example, if many users are trying to mint an NFT on Ethereum, the resulting congestion prevents other users from borrowing on Aave ( AAVE-USD ). In the context of a killer application, users need to be able to consistently interact with the blockchain. By contrast, Solana can segment those different pipelines using Local Fee Markets to charge different prices based on demand. This allows for many applications to have access to Solana even when one application is experiencing heavy usage. This is particularly important because the functionality of a killer application could depend upon simultaneous interaction with many different applications. Additionally, being able to adjust local fee markets to price different types of transactions may be the key to Solana adjusting its price based on the use case. This may allow Solana to price transactions differently based on each's economic value. Local Fee Markets may give the killer application developers greater precision in assessing its costs. Solana vs. Ethereum: Contrasting Philosophies Solana was built by Qualcomm (QCOM) engineers who applied their expertise in enhancing mobile network capacity to build a highly performant blockchain. The foundational principle of the Solana team is to build a network that assumes consumer-grade computing power grows with Moore's Law and networking bandwidth expands alongside it. As a result, Solana is engineered to take advantage of hardware advancements more directly than competitors. We see this as the mindset of optimism that believes in a future of abundance and progress. The core belief of the Solana team is that blockchains should make blockspace, or the amount of data that fits onto a chain in a time frame, very inexpensive. In their view, this unlocks the ability of software engineers and entrepreneurs to cheaply test new use cases for blockchain. This sharply contrasts with the view that Ethereum has evolved its business from that of selling cheap blockspace every day to that peddling expensive blockspace that secures consumer-facing blockchains. In the Ethereum paradigm, success hinges upon ETH being the principal (and only) collateral to secure all blockchains. The initial pitch for Solana was for it to become a ""Decentralized Nasdaq."" Though that narrative still has potential, the launch of fascinating non-financial consumer applications such as Hivemapper, Render, and Helium has expanded the perception of Solana's capabilities. The Solana team, to their credit, has been open-minded in use cases for Solana's ground-breaking technology. They've attempted to bring blockchain to the mobile phone through their SMS or Solana Mobile Stack, which allows developers to create blockchain applications for cell phones. Solana's experimentation has even led them to create their own mobile phone that is optimized to use blockchain. Though Solana Mobile was criticized as a distraction from Solana's core mission, It demonstrates Solana's desire to solve basic core user problems. It is this dedication to the consumer that has helped Solana ink partnerships with Shopify, Visa, and Google to explore new use cases for Solana and boost its ecosystem.

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Solana's Cost vs. Revenue Challenge Solana's focus on cheap blockspace, experimentation, and vanguard technology has not been without drawbacks. While providing cheap blockspace encourages ecosystem growth by giving projects and users a nearly costless ( to them ) sandbox, it is important to remember that supplying that blockspace still has costs. Though Solana has generated $1.26M in revenue fees over the previous 30 days, Solana's cost of securing its blockchain by paying validators using SOL inflation was $52.78M over the same time period. While Solana is not a business that is in danger of collapsing due to this lack of ""profitability"" in the near term, long term the cost of security must be met by organic SOL demand to use the Solana blockchain. This is because Solana validators sell some portion of their token inflation to cover their overhead costs, which include hardware, labor, and connectivity costs (we omit voting costs in this calculation). Solana Revenue Fees vs. Expenses Source: Token Terminal as of 10/25/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. We estimate that the total non-blockchain costs for running all of Solana's 1,977 validator nodes is ~$11.8M per year even before labor is included. As a result, we ballpark this figure as the minimum estimate of Solana's yearly SOL token sell pressure. On the revenue side, half of the revenue fees, $7.56M, are burned and this represents buy pressure of the SOL token (the other half of tokens are remitted to validators and stakers and are offset by potential selling). Applying this simplified summary of buy pressure and sell pressure, we calculate a net imbalance of -$4.24M which represents buy pressure that has to offset collective validator sell pressure. In practice, these token sales by Solana validators has been offset with capital from speculators. Thus, until fee revenue of Solana improves, Solana is an ecosystem whose ability to function in its current state depends upon the consistent introduction of new speculative capital. Long-term pricing of Solana's blockspace and how much it costs to utilize Solana is another thorny issue. The chief problem of a monolithic chain like Solana is that it is difficult to extract value from users and remit that back to token holders. This paradigm exists because Solana prices its transactions based on the required compute, total demand for compute, and congestion of the area where that compute is applied. While resource pricing is economically logical from the standpoint of pricing the Solana network's ability to allocate its network resources, it is illogical from the standpoint of pricing various user actions effectively. For example, sending a trade order to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ((CME)) is essentially free. However, the CME and other similar exchanges charge that trader a fee when that trade executes and may even change the amount charged based upon whether that trade executes after it ""actively takes"" another order or another order ""takes it."" Likewise, with something like Twitter, while it costs nothing to make a post if a user chooses to promote that post or target other users with that post, it will cost a lot. In a vacuum, this pricing, while suboptimal from a value extraction standpoint, is irrelevant. However, in the context of there being tens of thousands of blockchains, each tailored to a specific use case, each of these blockchains may be able to capture value more effectively for token holders. This may threaten the economic sustainability of Solana if weakening SOL prices cause Solana's security budget to fall below its needs. Likewise, from a resource's perspective, a blockchain will want to make sure to allocate its finite resources to economically beneficial activities. If resources are priced inadequately, a blockchain could become saturated with economically detrimental activities regardless of if those activities are segmented by Solana's Local Fee Markets. This has already happened and resulted in more disruption of more legitimate use cases. Likewise, while Solana is performing hundreds of transactions per second, many of these are low- value, arbitrage transactions spamming the network. Though Local Fees Markets may mitigate the issue, it is yet to be seen if this improvement will be sufficiently adaptable if Solana's usage meaningfully accelerates. We give Solana and its team immense credit for their vision and desire to experiment, but its architecture has led to undesirable outcomes that have affected Solana's technical stability. While Solana has had 100% uptime since March 2023 after a series of important network upgrades, previous to that, it has experienced unpredictable downtimes that completely halted network function. Between January 2022 and February 2023, Solana had occasions in 7 out of those 13 months with outages. The most recent of these outages, on February 25, 2023, lasted nearly 19 hours. The core issue of this outage and others in the past stems from the fact that Solana is running an experimental system. There is no formal verification of the Solana consensus mechanism, nor is there the ability to predict future failures in Solana's design because of the colossal data volumes that the system processes. Though Solana has implemented numerous improvements to mitigate past issues, Solana's design may make it impossible to understand future complications until they happen. As a result, the Solana team still considers the chain to be in ""Beta"" because future network failures could result from unforeseen causes. And because of the complexity of Solana and the amount of data it processes, resolving these issues might take substantial periods of time to fix. Clearly, this dynamic is unacceptable to serious financial and non-financial businesses that may want to deploy to Solana. The unpredictability of uptime is partly responsible for Solana's low TVL (total valued locked) in decentralized finance relative to its peers. While the Solana team has implemented what they believe are important fixes, network fragility will remain an issue for the foreseeable future, and the roll-out of the new design Firedancer may even increase the potential for irreconcilable problems. SCL Weekly Active Developer Market Share Source: Artemis XYZ as of 10/25/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Finally, we take some issue with Solana's ability to attract developers to its ecosystem. Because of the complexities of Solana's virtual machine ((SVM)) and Solana's complex design, creating applications on Solana is a challenging task. In fact, building is difficult for developers, that the founder of Solana Anatoly has likened it to "" Chewing Glass ."" This is partly due to the need for Solana developers to be familiar with Rust, a language with 2.2M active developers, compared to Ethereum which can draw from the 17.4M JavaScript developers. Though Solana has made great strides in creating the tooling to make development simpler, its high bar for programming proficiency has resulted in Solana accounting for roughly 6-7% of weekly active crypto developers over the last 18 months. While this consistent share is remarkable given that Solana lost one of its biggest backers in FTX/Alameda in November 2022, it needs to increase its total developer count as well as its market share of developers to increase the probability of hosting the tomorrow's blockbuster application. Though it may be likely that the average Solana developer is better than the average Polkadot (DOT-USD) developer, building a widely adopted consumer application may be analogous to the Infinite Monkey Theorem ((IFM)). In the IFM, the greater the number of monkeys one employs randomly hitting keys on a typewriter, the shorter the time (measured in eons) frame it takes for them to randomly write out the complete works of William Shakespeare. In the context of building an application that brings the next 100M users to the blockchain, the more developers working on the problem, the higher the likelihood of one of them randomly banging out the next Instagram.

These are solely the results of a simulation based on our research, and are for illustrative purposes only. Please conduct your own research and draw your own conclusions. More specifically, on revenues and cash flows, our framework begins by examining the different revenue items for Solana. First is a take rate on end market activity. We begin this exercise by identifying end markets that will utilize public blockchains, such as Ethereum and Solana. The three main categories for this are Finance, Banking and Payments ((FBP)), Metaverse and Gaming ((MG)), and Infrastructure (I). Depending upon the scenario, we then assume a certain portion of businesses and their revenues will be derived from blockchain activities or employ blockchain in some capacity to find customers, create new products, reduce costs, or simplify back-end business functions. Since public blockchains are analogous to Web 2.0 platforms like Amazon, the Apple App Store, and Uber, we then suppose that public blockchains will have an effective take rate of the GMV of their end markets' revenues. In our Base Case, we find a take rate that is 1/5th of the Ethereum equivalent take rate on blockchain activity. Thus, the total revenue to Solana from end-market transactions is $2.88B. Additionally, we also factor in MEV as a revenue item that is effectively waterfalled from trader entities to validators to token holders. We calculate MEV by estimating the total number of assets locked in Solana DeFi and multiply it by an annual take rate. Our Base Case finds revenue from MEV in 2030 to be $5.99B. Once we have the raw revenue figures, we deduct an assumed tax rate as well as an approximation of the validators' cost to the ecosystem.

Actual future performance of Solana is unknown, and may differ significantly from the hypothetical results depicted here. There may be risks or other factors not accounted for in the scenarios presented that may impede the performance of Solana. These are solely the results of a simulation based on our research, and are for illustrative purposes only. Please conduct your own research and draw your own conclusions. Despite its potential, we believe Solana's likelihood of hosting the majority of the world's crypto transactions by 2030 is lower than Ethereum's. While Solana's network and execution engine enables higher throughput and unlock greater potential, it lacks adoption momentum by the majority of crypto users and developers. Solana currently retains a substantially lower share of crypto TVL $408M out of $46B, and a similarly small percentage of daily active users, with 184K out of 5.5M. We also believe that new developers entering the space during widespread public blockchains may not be wedded to existing ecosystems nor be decentralization maximalists. As a result, future inbound new developers may become enamored with the next generation of blockchains that offer novel developer frameworks, features, and capabilities, as has been the case in prior crypto cycles As a result, in our base case, we see Solana adoption nearing 30% - a substantial jump from today's figures, but far lower than Ethereum's base case of 70%. This comparison is apt due to the blackhole-like effect of the Ethereum ecosystem growth by swallowing and absorbing ideas while increasing its share of blockchain developers. For context, our $11.8k price target for Ethereum was based on the ETH network achieving a 70% market share of value transmitted across open-source blockchains. Were Solana to avoid Ethereum's event horizon and achieve Ethereum-like dominance, our bull case reveals $51.8B in revenues and a $3,211 price target in 2030. Source: Space.com as of Oct 2023. In terms of value capture of end-market revenues that employ blockchain, we believe Solana has less potential for value capture than Ethereum. In our base case, we believe that Solana's value capture of GMV will be 20% of that of Ethereum's. We make this assertion based upon the simplicity of Solana's value capture stack and the philosophical assertions of the founder Anatoly Yakovenko that favor abundance over scarcity. The result of abundance over scarcity means that blockspace will remain inexpensive, and the result will be extremely cheap transactions. Putting this into mathematical terms, this ballparks Solana's ""take rate"" on GMV at 0.60% of FBP, 2.00% of MSG, and 1.00% of I.

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The key question is, ""given its low transaction pricing, how will Solana make money over the long term?"" Currently, transaction prices are so minuscule that it will take an immense amount of activity to bring up Solana's revenue figures. In our base model, we assume roughly 600B in yearly transactions by 2030, and we deduce that transaction figure from an expectation of 534M monthly active users given Solana's market share of end markets and an assumption of the number of transactions each user will perform. While MEV will be the most important value capture mechanism of Solana, accounting for 67.5% of all revenues in our base case, we believe there is a possibility that Solana can pull other levers to make its token more valuable even if usage does not appreciate to our base case estimates. As we noted earlier, blockchains must price activity in such a way as to be cheap enough to encourage widespread usage while still ensuring that its validators get paid enough to validate the network. Blockchains like Solana bootstrap this security budget, the money paid to validators, by building in inflation that dilutes existing token holders to compensate validators. Paying a security budget solely out of Inflation is not sustainable indefinitely if there is no economic activity or if economic activity on the chain is priced too cheaply. Long run, even if Solana is not able to attract 600B transactions per annum, they have ample levers to pull that could increase the token's value. The first of which is simply to raise transaction prices. While Solana will almost certainly see less transaction throughput if they raise prices, if there are economically valuable activities, it stands to reason that Solana should be able to effectively capture some of that value. Furthermore, Solana could also decrease the effective supply of its token by increasing the amount it charges programs (applications), crypto wallets, NFTs, and tokens to store data on the chain. On Solana, all entities that deploy code to Solana or operate a wallet must pay fees in SOL based on the size of their storage. Anyone using Solana also has the option to forgo this fee by keeping enough SOL in their account to pay for 2 years of rent. With storage fees at 0.00000348 SOL per byte and wallet data size of 372 bytes, each active wallet holder must maintain 0.0026 SOL. Similarly, applications and token smart contracts have to maintain these storage fees as well. A program like Serum which has around 340KB will need to keep a balance of 2.4 SOL to avoid paying rent. If Solana chooses to do so, it could dramatically increase these balances and effectively reduce the supply of floating SOL. Of course, these rent and transaction cost changes would violate the current principles of the Solana founding team, which controls the protocol. At the same time, there is no governance on Solana to mediate these decisions but recently some validators have brought up proposals to introduce token-voting governance on Solana. By the year 2030, we believe that Solana will already be practicing governance using token-voting and we believe this will enhance the economics of the SOL token if the Solana blockchain has a vibrant ecosystem of activity. Solana's Potential: Risks and Rewards Solana is an endlessly fascinating project that is committed to improving the user experience by pushing the edge of what is possible on a blockchain. As a result, it offers the cradle with the right features that have the best opportunity of growing the next killer application. Additionally, the Solana team are titans of the space whose non-consensus thinking has birthed in the most capable blockchain in existence. As they continue to innovate, their philosophy of experimentation and optimism has infused a small yet creative ecosystem of consumer-focused applications. Most importantly, Solana's community has a strong identity that allowed it to remain resilient despite immense setbacks that would have destroyed many other blockchain ecosystems. That said, Solana is surfing in currents that are far different from the consensus view of established names in the space, like Ethereum. Rather than specializing in modular blockchain components as Ethereum and its supplicants are building, they are cutting a course to develop an integrated blockchain that combines these components into an integrated data throughput machine. This is a monumental task, and the Solana team is starting from a position of relative weakness - they have fewer developers, TVL, VC funds and foundation capital to build their vision than EVM-compatible chains. Likewise, they still face tremendous questions over the long-term stability of their blockchain's technical approach. Still, even using terminal market share and take-rate assumptions well below that which we use for Ethereum, our model produces more upside in our base case for the SOL token. Thus, we believe a meaningful weight for SOL in investor portfolios is justified.

Moreover, the extent to which Web3 companies or digital assets utilize blockchain technology may vary, and it is possible that even widespread adoption of blockchain technology may not result in a material increase in the value of such companies or digital assets. Digital asset prices are highly volatile, and the value of digital assets, and Web3 companies, can rise or fall dramatically and quickly. If their value goes down, there's no guarantee that it will rise again. As a result, there is a significant risk of loss of your entire principal investment.

""There is no dispute that purchasers made an investment of money, either through fiat currency or crypto assets,"" the SEC wrote in its filing, which continues to rehash the regulator's argument that Kwon and Terraform sold securities.  The filing says that money being pooled in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits predominantly from the efforts of the promoters satisfies the Howey test and warrants judgment in favor of the SEC. The Howey test is a legal test used to determine whether a transaction qualifies as investment contract and can be considered a security under U.S. federal law.  Terraform and Kwon also engaged in fraudulent conduct and made misleading statements, the SEC reiterated in the filing, re-emphasizing that they committed fraud by deceiving investors about the stability of UST, falsely crediting their algorithm for its price stabilization while secretly arranging third-party intervention, making their claims about the algorithm's efficiency misleading and materially omitting crucial information. Terra collapsed in May last year, destroying billions of dollars in investor wealth.  All this comes days after Kwon's defense team filed a similar document asking the court to side with them as the SEC, in their opinion, hasn't managed to prove they were offering securities.

However, hours after launching and TIA listing on multiple exchanges, including OKX and KuCoin, the coin is struggling to match the initial enthusiasm. TIA Is Dropping, Blame The Celestia Airdrop? The coin is down 20% from recent highs and risks plunging some more. Reportedly, some airdrop recipients, chiefly Sybil groups, are liquidating the coin via mainstream exchanges. This is heaping more pressure on bulls. These recipients, according to Celestia, were early adopters of the project. In total, the platform allocated 60 million TIA for the airdrop, representing 6% of the total supply. Usually, crypto projects distribute free tokens in an airdrop as a strategy to raise awareness. To receive tokens, interested users must provide their wallet addresses and actively participate as a developer or a platform user. In Celestia’s case, for example, the network distributed TIA, to among others, developers. Related Reading: Solana Whales Deposit To Exchanges, Selloff Incoming? In total, 191,391 addresses are set to receive TIA from the airdrop. However, according to a recent report, at least 20% of these addresses are controlled by Sybil groups. By November 1, 138,981 addresses, representing 72% of all accounts, had already claimed roughly 44 million TIA out of the 60 million set aside for the airdrop. Sybil Group Operators Reaping Big, Dumping TIA That Sybil groups manipulated their way and received TIA could, according to researchers, suppress prices going forward. Technically, a Sybil group of malicious actors who create multiple fake identities aiming to take control of a given network, in this case, Celestia, or even destabilize the airdrop. Through the numerous fake identities created to receive the TIA airdrop, researchers discovered that Sybil group operators deposited to a single address before moving them to a crypto exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s 108% YTD Surge Highlights Crypto’s Growing Prominence The report notes that large-scale Sybil groups, which operate over 20 deposit addresses, received 5.22 million TIA. Meanwhile, large Sybil groups operating between five to 20 addresses ended up with 6.65 million TIA. At the same time, 51,494 addresses were suspected to be part of the Sybil group ring that received 17.05 million TIA. Out of this, researchers discovered that one profitable Sybil group, operating 300 airdrop addresses, received 77,391 TIA. Coins deposited to the 300 airdrop addresses were consolidated to one address and sent to OKX. Surprisingly, each of the 300 addresses ended up with 258 TIA, meaning Celestia didn’t notice they were associated and possibly operated by one entity.

Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney for the powerful Southern District of New York, told a gaggle of reporters crowded on the courthouse entrance that federal agents and lawyers have ""handcuffs for all"" fraudsters and crooks.  ""Here's the thing: The cryptocurrency industry might be new. The players like Sam Bankman-Fried might be new. But this kind of fraud, this kind of corruption is as old as time,"" Williams said.  Williams' statement came minutes after his team of federal prosecutors secured a ""guilty"" verdict on all seven counts of fraud and conspiracy against the former CEO of FTX, a crypto exchange that was once worth $32 billion.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Guilty on All 7 Counts in FTX Fraud Trial  Exactly one year ago, the young billionaire's crypto empire began to crumble when CoinDesk published a story based on the private balance sheet of Alameda Research, his trading firm. As prosecutors and even defense lawyers outlined during the five-week trial, that article set off a chain of events that ended in FTX's bankruptcy and the revelation that Alameda had taken billions of dollars of FTX customers' cash.  Williams was on hand to watch some of the trial's highlights, including closing arguments and the reading of the verdict. He walked into the packed courtroom late Thursday wearing a tan peacoat and a tightly tailored suit. At times during the proceeding he smiled, including when Judge Lewis Kaplan discussed Bankman-Fried's sentencing, scheduled for next March.  His district – the federal judicial system's influential artery for prosecuting high-profile financial frauds, including Bernie Madoff's – has more crypto cases on the way. Next month, Mango Markets exploiter Avraham Eisenberg is scheduled to stand trial for the theft of over $100 million in crypto from a decentralized exchange.  That case and others will push the limits of the government's policing of crypto's wild west. It may well force prosecutors to delve deep into complex crypto concepts, like ""decentralized exchanges,"" ""decentralized autonomous organizations,"" ""perpetual swaps"" and other mumbo-jumbo from an industry that is constantly rewriting itself.  The prosecutors' success against Bankman-Fried stems at least in part from their efforts to keep things simple – or as simple as possible given the heady circumstances. Throughout the trial they deemphasized the hard-to-follow crypto concepts in favor of a (relatively) simple narrative of traditional fraud, while avoiding entirely thornier, tertiary issues, like the legality of the FTT token issued by FTX.  That might not be possible in the cases to come, some of which are intrinsically tethered to mind-bending crypto concepts. But if Williams' courthouse statement is anything to go by, the SDNY is gearing up to take down more complex cases.

According to a report by Messari, the platform witnessed a significant increase in non-fungible token (NFT) sales, successful network upgrades, and the activation of a new token. Polygon NFT Sales Skyrocket Per the report, in Q3 2023, Polygon witnessed a staggering 131% quarter-on-quarter increase in weekly NFT sales volume, reaching an impressive $20 million. This growth was primarily attributed to the success of DraftKings’ Reignmaker NFT collection, which became the top collection on the network. The collection featured officially licensed cards from renowned sports organizations like the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), Professional Golfers’ Association of America (PGA TOUR), and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). Furthermore, through Q3, Polygon achieved significant milestones in terms of technological advancements. Related Reading: Shiba Inu News: ShibaSwap 2.0 And Pawzaar Unleash New Features Moreover, Polygon activated the POL token on its mainnet during Q3 2023. POL serves as an upgrade to the existing MATIC token and offers holders the opportunity to contribute to network security across various chains within the Polygon ecosystem through a native re-staking protocol. The token features an inflationary model with an annual issuance rate that is subject to community governance, which, according to the report, enhances the overall security and decentralization of the platform. Daily Active Addresses Surge Fueled By DeFi Dominance During Q3, Polygon experienced a 1.4% quarter-on-quarter growth in daily active addresses, reaching an impressive 364,000. The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector accounted for the majority of the active addresses on the network, showcasing the platform’s strength and popularity within the decentralized finance space. What’s more, Polygon Labs unveiled Polygon 2.0, a comprehensive upgrade roadmap aiming to unify all Polygon protocols and blockchains using ZK technology. This initiative seeks to establish Polygon as the “Value Layer of the Internet” and introduces significant updates to protocol architecture, tokenomics, and governance. One of the key upgrades includes transitioning the network to a zkEVM Validium network, ensuring enhanced security while sharing the same level of robustness as Ethereum (ETH).

However, the six-month data shows a decrease of 34.97%, indicating the impact of market volatility on the long-term value of the token. Polygon’s circulating market cap currently stands at $6.00 billion, exhibiting a 15.36% increase. However, the fully diluted market cap of $6.49 billion, which considers the total supply of tokens, has grown by 12.79%. The network’s fees over the past 30 days amounted to $1.21 million, representing a slight decline of 8.57%.

Though it is unclear when the coin will break from the current consolidation and extend gains of the recent few weeks, the endorsement from the founder can be bullish for the coin. Ethereum Is Bullish, What’s Next? Presently, ETH is changing hands at around $1,800 but remains below the psychological $2,000 level and July 2023 highs of approximately $2,100. The failure of ETH to break above immediate resistance lines can be a concern, considering the exemplary performance of Bitcoin (BTC) in the past few weeks. At press time, BTC is trading near 2023 highs after easing past July 2023 highs in late October 2023. The surge of Bitcoin prices shifted sentiment, forcing capital back into crypto, which had been relatively restive, reeling from the brutal effects of last year’s crypto winter, which spilled to 2023. Looking at the performance in the daily chart, ETH is up about 20% from October 2023 lows. Technically, the path of least resistance appears northwards, syncing with the general crypto trend whose trajectory seems reliant on Bitcoin. Related Reading: Dormant Bitcoin Whales Rouse From Slumber To Threaten BTC Rally As it is, the immediate resistance is around the $2,000 and $2,100 zone. If bulls build on the current momentum as Pal expects, breaking from the consolidation, ETH could surge to March 2022 highs of around $3,500. However, the leg up from spot rates largely depends on the strength of the breakout, a metric gauged by the trading volume. A high volume breakout, similar to the one recorded in the BTCUSDT when it broke above $32,000, may easily anchor optimistic buyers angling for a near 100% rally in the coming sessions. Ethereum Futures ETFs Are Live, But SEC Is Mum On ETH’s Status Though Pal is bullish, the founder didn’t specify the exact trigger that may lift the second most valuable coin to new levels, justifying why the ETHUSDT chart at the spot level is “gorgeous.” Still, the community is overly bullish because the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved the first Ethereum Futures Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). These products provide a new and regulated way for investors to gain exposure to ETH. Over time, this may attract institutional investors, which may drive prices higher.

A jury found him guilty and the former FTX CEO now faces a maximum sentence of 115 years in prison after jurors deliberated for less than five hours Thursday, according to media reports, including CNBC and Bloomberg. Judge Lewis Kaplan set a sentencing date for March 28, according to CNBC, which cited a source familiar. ""Sam Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,"" US Attorney Damian Williams, whose office led the investigation, said at a press conference outside the courthouse on Thursday. “A multibillion dollar scheme designed to make him the King of Crypto.” ""The cryptocurrency industry might be new,"" Williams added. ""The players like Sam Bankman-Fried might be new, but this kind of fraud, this kind of corruption, is as old as time, and we have no patience for it."" Since his arrest in December, the former billionaire has maintained his innocence, having pleaded not guilty to seven counts of federal fraud and conspiracy tied to the downfall of FTX ( FTT-USD ) and its sister trading firm Alameda Research. ""We respect the jury's decision, but we are very disappointed with the result,"" Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried's lawyer said in a statement to CNBC. ""Mr. Bankman-Fried maintains his innocence and will continue to vigorously fight the charges against him."" Earlier this month, three of Bankman-Fried's business affiliates told the jury that he posted or had influenced others to post misleading messages on social media to falsely represent the health of FTX ( FTT-USD ) in an effort to bring an end to a deposit run, Reuters noted in a story on Monday. All three cooperating witnesses have pleaded guilty and testified for prosecutors.

19732683,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558902,1698969684,Bitcoin Cash Rally Threatened As Exchange Drops BCH Following XRP Listing Rumors,"Bitcoin Cash has followed the general growth trend of Bitcoin with the price almost clearing the $250 resistance before being rejected. Even though BCH maintains this bullish momentum, it is not completely in the clear following its delisting from one crypto exchange. EDX Markets Delists Bitcoin Cash In another unexpected blow, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been delisted from the EDX Markets crypto exchange. Users had first suspected that the exchange was ending support for BCH and rumors spread like wildfire through social media. Eventually, the crypto exchange will confirm these rumors, with a spokesperson revealing that EDX Markets was indeed no longer offering support for BCH. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales Are Moving SHIB Again, Bearish Or Bullish? Contrary to the norm, EDX Markets did not give any indication of why the cryptocurrency was delisted from the exchange. Rather, users were directed to sign up for the newsletter to get updates about listings, as well as check out the website for supported coins. Interestingly, this is happening at a time when rumors have been circulating that EDX Markets might be planning to list XRP. This would make sense given that many exchanges have resisted the cryptocurrency after Ripple’s victory over the SEC. Since then, XRP’s volume has been on the high side and crypto exchanges have clamored for a chance to get a piece of the pie. BCH Price Struggles To HoldOn Following the rejection from the $250 level, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price has been hard-pressed to continue on its previous trajectory. The fall toward the $240 level shook out a good portion of longs before the bulls were able to take over once more. However, the BCH daily trading volume is still seeing good momentum after rising 36% in one day. If anything, this shows there is still a fair amount of interest in the altcoin with trading garnering a lot of attention from market participants.

If the price is able to clear this resistance, then the rally is expected to continue and could touch $270 before losing steam. But it is still a long way from its yearly high of $300. At the time of writing, BCH is trading at $243 with 3.75% losses on the weekly chart. However, it is performing much better in the last day after rising 2.23%.
