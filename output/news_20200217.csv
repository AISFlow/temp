In a blog post published last Thursday, Craig Wright said while forks of bitcoin (BTC) would be allowed under the open-source MIT license under which bitcoin was released, copying the database would not.      ""As the sole creator of Bitcoin, I own full rights to the Bitcoin registry. People can fork my software and make alternative versions. But, they have no rights to change the protocol using the underlying database,"" Wright wrote.      However, Bitcoin Core (the group that maintains and develops bitcoin) and Bitcoin ABC (the team behind bitcoin cash [BCH]) ""have sought to use my database without authority,"" Wright claimed.      It should be noted that Wright's claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of bitcoin, has not been proven either legally or to the satisfaction of many experts in the crypto community. He is also the backer of a different cryptocurrency, bitcoin SV (BSV), for Satoshi's Vision.      In the post, Wright appeared to suggest he might attempt to take legal action against Core and ABC, saying: ""Those involved with the copied systems that are passing themselves off as Bitcoin ... are hereby put on notice. Please trust me when I say that I’m far nicer before the lawyers get involved.""      Based on his claim to be bitcoin's inventor, Wright said Core and ABC infringe his intellectual property rights under the MIT open-source license under which bitcoin is issued. That, however, allows use of the code ""without restriction"" as long as the copyright notice and permissions notice are ""included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.""      The license states:    ""Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the ""Software""), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, ...""    Wright also asserted he has ""database rights"" in the EU and the UK. ""As a part of distributed global partnerships, senior partners within Core or ABC reside within Europe and the UK, presenting the opportunity to incorporate them in the matter without any jurisdictional challenges,"" he wrote.      Elsewhere, he claims to have issued all 21 million bitcoin and that nodes are in effect ""agents to my network.""      ""If you negotiate with me, arrangements can be made allowing the continuance of selected copies of my network, with a set of restrictions. In other words, I am willing to license ... the Bitcoin database. I will do so on my terms,"" he wrote.      In May 2019, Wright registered a copyright claim in the U.S. for the bitcoin white paper and original code, with a press release appearing soon after that claimed his authorship had thus been recognized. The Copyright Office responded days later, saying it had not recognized Wright as the author of the works and that it ""does not investigate the truth of any statement made"" in filings.

42404022,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhCiD,1581966000,"Russia's Central Bank Proposes New Token Framework, but Labels Crypto Transactions 'Suspicious'","The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has formally proposed a legal framework for tokenization, but also plans to label cryptocurrency transactions as suspicious activity, it said in a press release Monday.      The CBR announced it had successfully piloted a platform that allows users to tokenize assets, including equities and currencies, and issue them to investors.      Ivan Zimin, director of the CBR's financial technology department, said in the release the bank had now proposed using the platform as a framework in the country's upcoming cryptocurrency law, which will act as guidance for legitimate businesses wanting to tokenize assets.      ""Based on the results of the piloting, the Bank of Russia proposed to include in the draft federal law 'On Digital Financial Assets' the provisions necessary for the introduction and development of such decisions in the emerging digital assets market, which were supported by government bodies and businesses,” Zimin said.      This coincides with local media reports that the CBR is planning on updating bank guidance on what constitutes criminal activity, for the first time in eight years. According to business news site RBC, both the sale and purchase of cryptocurrencies could be considered suspicious under the new guidance.      Still undergoing in-house assessment, the guidance would ask commercial banks to flag activity and authorizes them to block transactions, and even close the accounts, of any clients found to be trading cryptocurrencies.      CBR's move has been met with some pushback from industry figures. Don Guo, CEO of technology and liquidity provider Broctagon, has criticized the fragmented approach. Speaking to CoinDesk, he said the two decisions on Monday will only create more uncertainty in the digital asset space.      ""Russia seems to have taken one step forward, two steps back when it comes to crypto,"" Guo said, adding it would leave ""Russian traders scratching their heads"" as other major economies, such as the U.S and China, continue to offer conflicting advice on how to regulate cryptocurrencies.      ""Where China has been advocating for bitcoin (BTC) and creating its own digital currency, other countries like the U.S. seem to be fighting a losing battle to squash it,"" Guo said. ""Whether regulators like it or not, the adoption of digital currencies will continue, and dismissing cryptocurrencies comes with an opportunity cost.""      Since 2017, the Russian government has been drawing up a bill that would regulate cryptocurrencies and related activities such as initial coin offerings (ICOs) and trades with fiat currencies like the ruble. Although officials have previously indicated the bill was nearing completion, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao hinted in a speech last October that Russian officials were being indecisive.      The Russian parliament passed a digital rights bill in early October that outlined basic ""digital rights"" in Russian law and also provided legal definitions for smart contracts and cryptocurrencies.      Monday's news suggests Russia is now trying to create a regulatory distinction between asset tokenization, which can more seamlessly be integrated into existing financial law, and cryptocurrencies, which cannot be as easily supervised and managed by the authorities.      In October, the CBR backed a potential ban on cryptocurrency payments, claiming they carried significant risks and could not be equated with legal tender.      Reportedly one of the largest projects to ever come out of CBR's regulatory sandbox since it launched in April 2018, the tokenization platform was developed by Nornickel, a Russian mining and smelting company. Also allowing organizations to mint ""hybrid tokens"" backed by different assets simultaneously, the platform will go into operation once Russia's cryptocurrency bill passes into law.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TOKEN SALE,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/17/russias-central-bank-proposes-new-token-framework-but-labels-crypto-transactions-suspicious,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1232cf20f1790ed79cccf6da13940aa80abb26a7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The 84 patents filed on Feb. 13 include proposals related to the supply and issuance of a CBDC as well as interbank settlements using the digital yuan and the integration of digital currency wallets into existing retail bank accounts, according to a report by the Financial Times.      While the Chinese government is still largely quiet on the initiative, the new patents signify China’s efforts to ramp up development work on its digital currency electronic payment (DCEP) system in a bid to outdo other major economies such as the U.S. and the EU.      The latest developments are unlikely to have an impact on crypto assets in the long term becausethe issuance of a digital yuan would be tightly controlled with no public mining or trading with existing cryptos, said eToro analyst Nemo Qin.

As the markets digested the news and began to understand the intentions behind China’s move, prices for the bellwether crypto dropped by more than 37 percent before recovering by January of this year.      Indeed, China’s ambitions have encouraged more players to enter the space, with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) setting up a group to discuss potential cases for interoperable CBDCs.      “We can expect more central banks to announce developments in their own crypto assets using blockchain technology,” Qin added.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/17/chinas-dcep-unlikely-to-impact-crypto-markets-in-the-long-term-etoro-analyst-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a6523130bb6b77213b8e78c498cc9643ca4e119-1500x938.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404026,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhCn8,1581955227,Derivatives Exchange Deribit Launches Daily Ether Options,"Panama-based cryptocurrency derivatives exchange Deribit has listed daily options on ether (ETH).      The platform announced the news on Twitter on Monday. The new product will have strike price intervals of $5 and can be traded in the 24 hours preceding the expiry at 08:00 UTC every day. They will have a lifetime of two trading days at the time of introduction.      From Feb. 19, the exchange will also be reducing the tick size for all ether options from the current 0.001 ETH to 0.0005 ETH, Deribit CMO Andras Caron said.      Options are derivative contracts based on the value of the underlying instrument. A call option (bullish bet) gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy the asset at a specific price on or before the predetermined date. Meanwhile, a put option (bearish bet) represents the right to sell.      Deribit launched longer duration cash-settled options on ether at the end of March 2019. Since then, the exchange has traded an average daily volume of $1.9 million, according to Skew Markets.      Volumes have risen sharply on the exchange this year with the increased price activity in the ether market. Notably, a record single-day volume of $13 million was registered on Feb. 13. The cryptocurrency recently rose to a seven-month high of $290 and has gained nearly 100 percent so far this year.      The derivative space has heated up over the past few months with big names including Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Intercontinental Exchange's Bakkt launching options on bitcoin (BTC).      Deribit, however, is still the leader when it comes to options volume. As of Jan. 28, Deribit accounted for nearly 90 percent of the global volume, according to Skew.      The latest decision to launch daily ETH options comes two weeks after daily bitcoin options went live, and could attract more users for the exchange, particularly from day traders.      ""Daily options only have one or two days remaining lifetime and thus lower time value or premium and thus [are] cheaper. These shorter-dated, cheaper options are great instruments to use for short term strategies enabling the trader to hedge events or benefit from expected short term moves,"" said Caron.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/17/derivatives-exchange-deribit-launches-daily-ether-options,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16b53ee298a2b5b6072ab38ccdbac0d348208d06-1500x842.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404017,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhCcJ,1581953161,"Speculation Undermines Crypto Prices and Utility, Says Bank of England Senior Economist","Speculation creates congestion on the blockchain that harms a cryptocurrency's utility and overall value, according to a senior economist at the Bank of England (BoE).      Peter Zimmerman, who has been a senior economist at the U.K. central bank since 2007, argued in a working paper published Friday that speculation undermines the effectiveness of cryptocurrencies to function as a means of payment.      Because blockchains have a limited processing capacity, periods of high usage make transactions slower and more expensive, the paper observes. Assuming a cryptocurrency's value derives from its utility as a payment tool, on-chain congestion makes transactions slower and more expensive, making it less useful and therefore less valuable to holders.      ""Limited settlement space creates competition between users of the currency, so speculative activity can crowd out monetary usage,"" reads the working paper. ""Speculation congests the blockchain, reducing the moneyness of cryptocurrency, and impacting its price.""      Rampant speculation might have actually impeded mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, Zimmerman's working paper suggests. There is also the secondary ""digital gold"" effect that as the price rises some users who would otherwise have used cryptocurrencies as a means of payment decide to hoard it instead, anticipating a further rise in the price.      If speculative activity could be moved off distributed ledgers, using cash-settled derivatives or layer-2 scaling protocols like the lightning network, this could have ""profound consequences"" for the nature of cryptocurrencies that could make it behave more similarly to other asset-classes, the paper suggests.      Zimmerman assumes that the main value driver of cryptocurrencies is their utility as a means of payment, although he does suggest the model may not apply in the same degree to initial coin offering (ICO) tokens, where multiple versions work on the same blockchain at the same time.      Speaking to CoinDesk, Zimmerman said the model applies to any circumstance where speculative activity ""makes it harder to use the token for its intended purpose."" That can include peer-to-peer trading for security tokens as well as platform tokens, like ether, where ""conflict between demand for blockchain space from [decentralized applications], and demand for blockchain space from speculation"" can impede utility.      The sudden surge in popularity for the ethereum trading game CryptoKitties ""filled up the blockchain and made it harder for people to use dapps and exercise smart contracts,"" he added as an example.      The BoE allows staff to articulate their own views and findings through working papers. These, however, do not represent the views of the bank itself. The BoE formed a working group in January with five other central banks to share research and ideas surrounding central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/17/speculation-undermines-crypto-prices-and-utility-says-bank-of-england-senior-economist,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df2c433eafccbadebf69915320e2dfd875b5092d-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404024,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhCgF,1581948047,Crypto Exchange FCoin Insolvent After Revealing Up to $130M Bitcoin Shortfall,"FCoin, a crypto exchange that adopted the controversial ""trans-fee mining"" model, has paused trading and withdrawal as it reveals a shortage of crypto assets worth up to $130 million.      Zhang Jian, the former Huobi CTO who launched FCoin in May 2018, wrote a lengthy post on Monday, saying the exchange is now unable to process users' withdrawal demands as its asset reserve has fallen short of its liability – and the gap is estimated to be about 7,000 to 13,000 bitcoin (BTC).      The post, first published in Chinese and later translated on Reddit, comes as a shocking notice to users in China as the significant amount of assets in question led to the insolvency of the controversial model that at one point made FCoin one of the largest exchanges by trading volume.      Zhang claimed in the post the exchange was neither hacked nor an exit scam but the problem is ""a little too complicated to be explained in a single sentence.""      In summary, he said the issue came from internal system errors that have – for a long period of time – credited users with more transaction-based mining rewards than they should have received. As the company failed to spot this soon enough to remedy the situation, the snowball has grown even larger since the beginning of 2019.    Trans-fee mining    Fcoin went live around May 2018, introducing a novel model called ""trans-fee mining"" to incentivize trading and to issue its exchange token dubbed FT.      Instead of launching an initial coin offering or an airdrop, FCoin issued 51 percent of its FTs to the public in exchange for making transactions. For instance, for every transaction fee a user paid to FCoin in the form of either bitcoin or ethereum, the platform would reimburse the user 100 percent of the value in FTs.      In addition, FCoin would distribute 80 percent of the transaction fees it collected in bitcoin and ether to users who held FTs bitcoin continuously throughout a day. This model, while being criticized for possibly enabling price manipulation of the FT, was quickly adopted by others and led to a shake-up among exchanges in terms of volume ranking.      However, according to Zhang, errors in FCoin's system started to give away more mining rewards to users than they should have earned, beginning in mid-2018. The firm did not set up a complete back-end auditing system to properly manage its treasury until mid-2019, he said.      As the price of FT continuously decreased through 2019, Zhang said he and his team have been buying back FTs from the secondary market in efforts to increase the buying demand for the token's price, which was one of the ""decision errors"" he made.      Zhang said the system problem coped with these ""decision errors"" gave a large amount of users the opportunity to sell and withdraw more than what should have been on their account balance, causing the significant loss of FCoin's assets on its own balance sheet.      The announcement came just days FCoin suspended its entire platform after discovering a risk-control issue. Zhang said in the post that he will now personally and manually process users' withdrawal requests made via emails.      He claimed that he will ""switch tracks and start again"" and hopes to use profits from his new projects to ""compensate everyone for their losses.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/17/crypto-exchange-fcoin-insolvent-after-revealing-up-to-130m-bitcoin-shortfall,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b805b4e1a382df3a9dbc4656c69e721bb9b145b-1000x706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Many bitcoiners see cryptocurrency as a cypherpunk tool that enhances personal freedoms, with cypherpunk meaning “using privacy tech to promote social change.” There are diverse users around the world gaining this type of value from bitcoin, but they rarely give interviews or are seen on stage at conferences.

42404019,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhCbK,1581944400,Binance to Announce White-Label Exchange Infrastructure for Local Markets,"Binance will soon be launching a digital asset trading platform that can be rebranded by smaller exchanges for their local markets.      Binance Cloud will offer local exchanges spot market and futures trading, as well as local bank API integrations and peer-to-peer (P2P) fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchange services, the company will say in a statement this week.      Implementing a product like Binance Cloud would relieve potential exchange operators of the software burdens involved in security and scalability. That gives them more time to worry about, say, getting the proper licenses and registrations in their jurisdiction.      Binance Cloud will offer the matching engine, security controls and liquidity of the main Binance.com exchange. So while an exchange may have its own branding and local fiat currency, the back end will basically be Binance itself, which will bring the benefit of more liquidity, albeit indirectly, and potentially in places where Binance doesn’t currently operate.      “The Binance Cloud service is an all-in-one solution, featuring an easy-to-use dashboard that allows customers to manage funds, trading pairs and coin listings, as well as multilingual support, depth-sharing with the Binance.com global exchange, and more opportunities to collaborate with the ecosystem,"" the company said.      Soon, Binance also plans adding “staking and OTC (over-the-counter) trading services, as well as token launch capabilities via an IEO (initial exchange offering) platform.      This could mean Binance would have to compete with AlphaPoint, one of the largest infrastructure providers on the cryptocurrency exchange market today. Founded in 2013, AlphaPoint provides software services to some of the largest exchanges in the world, although it doesn't discuss specific clients.      Exchanges are not easy to build. There are many elements to consider such as order types and matching as well as other features. Security and scaling during massive bull runs are also huge concerns for exchanges.      Security has been an issue for Binance itself. It was breached in 2019 with $40.7 million stolen after hackers accessed exchange users’ API keys and 2FA codes. While an explanation on further technical details was never published on the hack, the exchange covered the losses via its “Secure Asset Fund for Users” (SAFU) insurance fund.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/17/binance-to-announce-white-label-exchange-infrastructure-for-local-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8dbb1950a0118a4badeb44a73c6070259e333d8a-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Participants in the Series A included two U.K.-based venture capital firms, LocalGlobe and MMC Ventures, as well as the Berlin-based Target Global, which specializes in investing in European companies so they can fund global expansion, according to a Monday announcement.      The London-based startup said it aims to develop a presence in key regional areas, including Asia and North America, as well as enhance its offering to feature more sophisticated trading facilities found in traditional prime brokerage offerings.      ""Copper was always designed to be a global offering,"" said Copper founder and CEO Dmitry Tokarev, who was formerly CTO at Dolphin Wealth Management, a U.K.-based asset manager. “This venture funding round is a real vote of confidence from investors. Their support will allow us to accelerate our scale up, hiring teams in key regions and introducing new products and services to better meet their needs.”      Speaking to CoinDesk, Tokarev said the Series A will help the firm hire specialists who can deal with local regulations, as well as business development teams for the new markets. This will give greater support for existing customers in Asia and America, as well as provide the company with a toe-hold to begin offering services to a new client base.      Copper has also planned on establishing an office in Hong Kong, although the coronavirus outbreak has stalled the effort, with a final judgment to be made sometime at the end of the first quarter.      New products include a margining facility as well as tri-party repos, a type of contract that provides financial services to traders involved in borrowing funds by selling assets.      Having launched in 2018, Copper offers multi-signature custody and prime brokerage – services for institutional trading – to its clients, which include various funds, financial institutions and high-net-worth private traders. This is provided by Copper's Walled Garden infrastructure, giving clients access to trading facilities without taking digital assets out of custody.      Copper raised $1.3 million in a seed round in 2018 to build out its prime brokerage and custodian solution.      Describing the Walled Garden solution as a ""fundamental breakthrough in the market,"" Mike Lobanov, general partner at Target Global, said Copper was providing ""institutions with traditional prime brokerage services for the crypto world.""      In September, Copper reported it had processed $500 million in aggregated trading volume in the three months since the launch of its solution in June. Tokarev told CoinDesk $500 million was now Copper's trading volume on a monthly basis.      ""Since 2017, we have seen many crypto custody solutions emerge that don’t fully meet the needs of institutions,"" said Tokarev. ""Instead, they have built for an institutional framework that doesn’t exist yet, and is unlikely ever to, leaving institutions discouraged.""      ""I think any volumes that we currently have, or anyone else in the sector would have, can be 10-times multiplied when the proper infrastructure is there,"" he said.      Copper currently onboards an average of two to three funds every week and currently has about 30 active clients on the platform, according to Tokarev.      In mid-January, the custodian was selected to provide prime brokerage services for a fund created by private London investment house Nickel Digital Asset Management.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/17/london-based-crypto-custodian-copper-raises-8m-for-expansion-overseas,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e0b9a25c17e0cac7c2df7eb48f33a06040b3881-1500x950.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404031,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhCr4,1581938671,Low-Volume Bitcoin Pullback Stalls at Price Support Near $9.6K,"Bitcoin defended key support around $9,600 on Sunday with a doji candle, stalling the price pullback and putting the market into neutral.  A break above Sunday’s high of $10,051 is needed to revive the short-term bullish view. That would likely light a fire under buyers, fueling a rise to the recent high of $10,500.  On the downside, Sunday’s low of $9,598 is now the level to beat for the bears.    Bitcoin’s (BTC) price pullback looks to have stalled, with the bears losing steam near former hurdle-turned-support on Sunday.      The number one cryptocurrency by market cap ran into offers over the weekend, having faced multiple rejections near $10,500 on Feb. 12–13.      Notably, the cryptocurrency fell nearly 4.5 percent on Sunday – its biggest single-day decline since Nov. 24 – with sellers driving prices as far as support at $9,615 – a higher high created on Feb. 3. The former resistance level, however, withstood the bear attack.      Bitcoin went on to close Sunday on a flat note above $9,900, forming a doji candle on the daily chart – a sign of hesitation from the bears near the price support.    Daily chart    While Sunday’s doji candle has weakened the case for a deeper pullback, a bull revival is still not confirmed. For that, prices need to find acceptance above Sunday’s high of $10,051.      So far, the positive follow-through to the doji has remained elusive. The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $9,730 on Bitstamp and its global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, is seen at $9,750.      The immediate outlook would turn bullish if prices rise above $10,051, possibly causing more buyers to join the market and yielding a re-test of the recent high of $10,500.      If Sunday’s low of $9,598 is breached, it would mean the period of indecision, as represented by the doji candle, has ended with victory for the bears. In that case, a stronger downside move toward $9,075 (Feb. 4 low) could be seen.      That said, the longer duration studies are still biased in favor of a breakout above $10,051. For instance, the 50- and 200-day averages are about to produce a golden crossover (bull cross) for the first time in nearly 10 months, a pattern that may prompt increased buying pressure.    Weekly chart    The relative strength index is hovering in the bullish territory above 50 and the MACD is producing higher bars above the zero line, a sign of strengthening of bullish momentum.      The five- and 10-week averages are also trending north, indicating a bullish setup.    4-hour chart    The pullback from $10,500 lacks substance as trading volumes have tapered off since Feb. 13.

According to a report from Bloomberg on Sunday, the firm's CEO and co-founder, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, said in an interview an application has already been submitted to the island state's authorities under new legislation passed in late January.      “We submitted the application pretty fast. Binance’s Singapore entity has been in close touch with the local regulators, and they have always been open-minded,” Zhao told Bloomberg.      The updated Payments Services Act brings what are termed digital payment token (DPT) services – covering all crypto-based businesses and exchanges plying their trade in Singapore – under current anti-money laundering (AML) and counterterrorist-financing (CTF) rules.      Under the act, crypto firms are required to first register and then apply for a license to operate in the jurisdiction.      Binance already has an office in Singapore, Bloomberg indicates.      As of Jan. 28, 2020, the payments act gave existing crypto firms a month to register with the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Once firms are registered, they are given a six-month period in which they must apply for their payment institution license.      Binance, once a purely crypto-to-crypto exchange, has been working to expand its user base in recent months with the addition of fiat payment gateways. Last week it added 15 cryptocurrencies through Israeli payment processor Simplex. It's also just hired a former Uber exec to help drive global growth.      While Singapore's new regime means crypto firms will have to run their operations to a high regulatory standard, it also brings them legitimacy and an official licensed status.

42404018,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhCeH,1581919200,Chinese Blockchain Startup Hires VC Exec to Lead North American Expansion,"Blockchain startup Conflux has hired Eden Dhaliwal, the former head of crypto at Outlier Ventures, as a managing director to lead its expansion in North America.      The Beijing-based firm is set to open an office in Toronto within two weeks. It is assembling a 10-person team to conduct research and seek local potential business partners, Dhaliwal said.      “Generally, our network is going to be a pathway and conduit into the China market for our partners in North America, given our traction in the country,” he said.      The startup’s global expansion came after it received a rare official endorsement and financial backing from the Shanghai government in January. Its public chain project raised $35 million from major investors such as Sequoia and Huobi via a private token sale in 2018.      Conflux’s blockchain uses a proof-of-work mechanism, similar to the bitcoin network's, to reach consensus on the state of the ledger with its native tokens. The firm claims the public permissionless network is able to scale up while maintaining the same level of security as any PoW network.      Dhaliwal joined Conflux on Jan. 1. He left the Toronto office of London-based Outlier Ventures at the end of December after working at the Web3 venture capital firm for over three years. Dhaliwal will remain an advisor of the firm. He previously worked as an advisor at DLT Labs and a mentor at Techstars.      Outlier Ventures has backed a spate of blockchain protocol providers. The firm participated in a $4 million funding round in smart contract language creator Agoric in May along with Ripple. It led a funding round with Polychain in Haja Networks, which offers open-source products facilitating interoperability between different chains.      Conflux aims to provide a public decentralized platform where developers can create applications and marketplaces, Dhaliwal said.      “We think there are opportunities to expand beyond ethereum, especially in the decentralized finance space,” Dhaliwal said. “Our early focuses are definitely on DeFi and open finance such as decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, payments, remittance and lending.”      “We are also going to be focused on ecosystem development that involves everything from partnering with other projects in the Web3 stack, decentralizing our mining to working with startups,” he added.      Conflux has also set up an office in Nigeria as a base to build a presence in Africa. The firm sees great potential there since most of the countries do not have a legacy system, according to Dhaliwal.      Toronto is one of the largest financial hubs in North America and it has a very strong developer community, Dhaliwal said. It is a convenient place for the team to network in New York as well, given the Canadian city’s close proximity to the Big Apple, he said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | CFX | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/17/chinese-blockchain-startup-hires-vc-exec-to-lead-north-american-expansion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b90171f35ddf95f515c918ebc423c9e67b3af529-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403996,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhBaM,1581908400,Bitcoin Mining Unit Manufacturer MicroBT Nibbles at Bitmain's Market Share,"Bitcoin miner maker MicroBT has rapidly expanded market share by selling over half a million units in 2019, chipping away at rival Bitmain's dominance.      MicroBT sold about 600,000 units of its flagship WhatsMiner M20 series last year, Vincent Zhang, sales head of the Shenzhen-based company, said in an online panel hosted by Chinese mining pool Poolin on Thursday in a WeChat group.      These products generate a computing power of about 60 terahashes per second (TH/s) on average, he said. That means the newly delivered 600,000 units may have contributed over 30 exahashes (EH/s) of hashing power to the bitcoin network in 2019. (1 EH = 1 million TH).      Amid bitcoin's (BTC) price jump throughout 2019, the network's two-week average computing power more than doubled from just 40 EH/s around the end of 2018 to nearly 100 EH/s in December. That'd mean close to half of bitcoin's computing power growth in 2019 may have come from equipment delivered by MicroBT.      Zhang didn't specify the precise average unit price of these batches, as they could fluctuate depending on bitcoin's price over the year. But the firm's various models in its M20 product line are generally priced between $24 to $30 per terahash, meaning the firm has brought home a high nine-figure revenue in U.S. dollars for 2019.      Bitcoin's current computing power stands at 110 EH/s. That also means MicroBT may account for around 30 percent of bitcoin mining power sold right now, making it one of the largest and fastest-growing miner makers in the world.    Situation in flux    Meanwhile, crypto research firm Coinshares estimated in a report on Dec. 12 that Bitmain's dominance of sold bitcoin hash rate was about 65 percent at the time, already down from 75 percent in 2018.      But this number may already be slightly outdated as bitcoin's computing power has since then grown by yet another 20 percent, jumping from 92 EH/s in mid-December to about 110 EH/s at the moment.      Hangzhou-based Canaan Creative, maker of the Avalon miner, which went public in the U.S. in November, estimated in its initial public offering filing that it accounted for around 20 percent of bitcoin computing power sold for the first six months of 2019. The firm has yet to release its full-year results.      That said, Bitmain's mining equipment still dominates the market, resulting from the successful sales of its AntMiner S7 from 2015 to 2016 and later its S9 model from 2017 to 2018.      According to Bitmain's IPO filing in September 2018 in Hong Kong, the firm delivered about 500,000 bitcoin miners in 2015 and 2016, and further sold 3 million units from the beginning of 2017 to June 30, 2018, amid the crypto market's bull run.    Halving looms    While S9s – with an average 14 TH/s computing power – are still the most widely used miners, they are facing an increasing risk of becoming obsolete as bitcoin's halving event approaches in May, which will reduce bitcoin's mining rewards from 12.5 bitcoin per block to 6.25.      CoinDesk reported earlier this month that mining farms have been procuring the latest and most powerful miners to expand their facilities or replace older models in preparation for the upcoming halving.      While Bitmain its latest AntMiner S17 series last year to rival MicroBT's WhatsMiner M20 product line, the latter has significantly outrun Bitmain in terms of mass production and shipments.      The two firms are also racing to deliver even more powerful machines in 2020 ahead of the halving event, namely, the AntMiner S19 and WhatsMiner M30. That said, the actual production quantity of these products still largely depends on the supply of wafers from semiconductor companies such as Samsung or TSMC, which, according to Zhang, is ""very limited.""    Coronavirus' impact    Meanwhile, as the coronavirus outbreak in China delays manufacturing and logistics, bitcoin's computing power growth has stagnated for the time being. In fact, data from mining pool BTC.com estimates that bitcoin's mining power is poised to decrease by 1.78 percent in about eight days.      Zhang said in the WeChat group that MicroBT has resumed its production.      ""Currently, part of the logistics has also gone back to work. ... So now the supply of miners is not a big issue but not every mining farm is physically accessible,"" he said.
