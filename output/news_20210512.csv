42406356,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetyEh,1620861192,"Dogecoin to Get DevOps Support for Commercial Apps Via DogeLabs.IO, AppSwarm","Mobile apps development firm AppSwarm Corp and blockchain research lab and startup accelerator DogeLabs.Io plan to build out a global Dogecoin development team that will focus on building applications on top of the memecoin's blockchain.      DogeLabs.io, a company focused on developing commercial apps around the Dogecoin protocol, said the newly formed DevOps teams would share ideas and support Dogecoin-based apps. AppSwarm is a publicly traded, over-the-counter company that develops mobile-based apps for business enterprise, e-commerce and retail, and the gaming industry. It filed to sell securities in the U.S. in September 2019, but the Securities and Exchange Commission apparently did not allow the effort to proceed.      The research lab is still in the hiring process but it plans to set up its DogeLabs DevOps teams in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America. It will be responsible for expanding the projects related to the Shiba Inu-themed DOGE.      Dogecoin's blockchain development has been more sporadic than those for other top coins. Over the last six years very little has been done with the base layer code. Prior to the recent Dogecoin Core 1.14.3 release on Feb. 28, the last major development was posted on Nov. 8, 2019. There have been notable gaps between Nov. 10, 2015, and Feb. 4, 2018, where no updates were published at all.      DogeLabs said it would also be building out a support program for new developers who wish to get involved in building on top of the Dogecoin blockchain with Github labs, developer docs, open Discord discussions and Slack development teams. There is no mention in the company statement, however, of supporting developers who will help maintain and build the actual Dogecoin blockchain.    Read more: Want to Buy Dogecoin? Read This First    ""While we build out our own development teams here in New York City and [Tulsa, Okla.] the plan is to also bring together developers from around the world who wish to build off the Doge blockchain,” said Tom Bustamante, CEO of DogeLabs.      The meme-based cryptocurrency was co-created and launched on Dec. 3, 2013, by Jackson Palmer as a joke. Dogecoin is based on Bitcoin’s codebase and was forked from Litecoin.      “From the Dallas Mavericks to SpaceX DOGE-1 Moon project, doge is quickly going from a joke MEME coin to an actual form of currency payment with real organizations. DogeLabs’ goal is to encourage new use cases around the Doge protocol, which could include DeFi (decentralized finance) applications,” said Bustamante.

42406363,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetyLa,1620857442,Elon Musk Says Tesla Is Suspending Bitcoin Payments Over Environmental Concerns,"In a tweet Wednesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the electric-car company is discontinuing bitcoin payments.      Tesla had announced it was accepting BTC for car payments starting in February. The announcement came in concert with a $1.5 billion investment in bitcoin as a treasury asset.      Musk has since continued his championship of DOGE, the meme currency currently boasting a market cap of $58 billion, according to CoinDesk data.      Cryptocurrency “cannot come at great cost to the environment,” the electric carmaker said in a statement tweeted by Musk. The statement was hedged, but only slightly, with praise for crypto’s “promising future” and a promise to investigate less energy-hungry networks than Bitcoin’s.      Bitcoin, a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain reliant on energy-intensive mining units, has come under fire from environmental groups as its price has surged to all-time highs. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, ether, also relies on PoW but is in the process of switching to proof-of-stake.      Tesla's pledge turns up the heat on the race to move bitcoin away from fossil fuels. The company's decision to accept bitcoin was a watershed moment for corporate bitcoin adoption. Tesla's turnabout on environmental matters will likely give fuel to the social and even political moment clamoring for change to the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap.    Read more: Elon Musk’s Tesla Sold Bitcoin in Q1 for Proceeds of $272M    The sudden freeze of Tesla’s bitcoin payments hands a decisive win to bitcoin’s energy critics. But it does not spell doom for Tesla’s remaining bitcoin investment nor its crypto experiment. “Tesla will not be selling any bitcoin,” the statement read. “We intend to use it for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy.""      No such plans are publicly known. The most reputable report on the matter says nearly 40% of bitcoin’s energy consumption was carbon-neutral.      Tesla did test the liquidity of the bitcoin market with a $272 million sell announced during its most recent earnings call.      Bitcoin's price is now down nearly 6% over the past 24 hours, though it fell about $2,000 after Musk's tweet.

42406370,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetyST,1620852184,Market Wrap: DeFi Tokens Aave and Uniswap Climb While ETH and BTC Dump,"Bitcoin and ether seem to be more sensitive to a fickle global stock market. But that hasn't affected aave and uniswap and other altcoins making huge upward swings, fueled by DeFi hype.    Aave (AAVE) trading around $567 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 27.7% over the previous 24 hours.  Uniswap (UNI) trading around $40.69 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 7.6% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether (ETH) trading around $4,090 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.33% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $3,955-$4,364 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $54,547 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Losing 3.8% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $53,700-$57,944 (CoinDesk 20)  DeFi tokens are hot    The biggest CoinDesk 20 gainers Wednesday were AAVE, jumping 27% and UNI, up 7%, as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). Aave is a lending protocol while uniswap is used to exchange tokens in decentralized finance (DeFi), the sector underpinned by the Ethereum blockchain.      “The crypto market is primarily focused on Ethereum and the catapulting DeFi sector right now,” said Nick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment analytics platform Trade the Chain. “The narrative is completely off bitcoin and focused primarily on DeFi, Ethereum and the burgeoning altcoin market.”      It’s no surprise why: As of press time Aave is up fivefold in 2021, with uniswap jumping almost sevenfold so far this year. One fundamental metric Mancini pointed to is total value locked in DeFi. The data aggregator DeFi Pulse reports TVL, which is used to gain profits in return for liquidity, has doubled within three months and is up to $86 billion as of press time.      “DeFi interest is clearly one of the primary drivers behind ether’s recent price rise,” added Mancini.    Ether May options expiry looking conservative    Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading around $4,090 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), up 0.33% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average but above the 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians.      In the ether options market, traders aren’t convinced the asset’s bull run will continue. The probabilities for ETH price at May 21 expiration, according to Skew, have the asset at a 52% chance of being over $4,000, a 32% likelihood over $4,500 and just a 19% chance over $5,000.      “A small pullback seems likely,” noted Mancini on ether’s run-up. “No rally lasts forever.”      Of concern to some traders is that ether’s sky-high valuation will cause fees to make the network unusable. Indeed, on Tuesday, the last day for a full dataset as of press time, Ethereum’s fees hit a high not seen since February, approaching 30,000 ETH in fees for just one day.      Peter Chan, lead quant trader at OneBit Quant, is concerned that in a hot market the fees on decentralized exchanges (DEX) and even centralized exchanges (CEX) are getting out of control. This is due to the strained and overused nature of cryptocurrency networks like Ethereum, which has limited capacity.      “You probably have to use a CEX instead but withdrawal fees are also skyrocketing,” Chan told CoinDesk.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, bitcoin, was down 3.8% Wednesday at press time, at $54,547. The largest cryptocurrency was below the 10-hour moving average and the 50-day, a bearish signal for market technicians.      “The drop in crypto markets coinciding with an ugly close of the U.S. markets can be explained by some correlation trades leading to quick profit-taking in cryptos,” said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer, ExoAlpha. “Bitcoin is back in the middle of its 'Twilight Zone' of $50,000-$60,000.”      Spot bitcoin volumes on major exchanges are down Wednesday, according to Skew. Today’s $1.6 billion in volume across eight major institutional exchanges is 25% lower than the average $2.1 billion the past three months.      “The lengthy consolidation for the price of bitcoin seems completely ordinary for a crypto bull market,” said Sean Rooney, head of research at digital asset manager Valkyrie Investments.      “In Q2 of 2017, bitcoin experienced a similar reaction as [initial coin offerings] took center stage,” added Rooney. “Many outperformed BTC to the upside throughout the summer before BTC resumed a strong uptrend in the fourth quarter.”      Read More: Fairlead’s Stockton Warns of Bitcoin Correction to $42K, Based on Technical Analysis    Other markets    Vitalik Buterin has told dog-themed memecoin creators to bark up another tree.

Diem Networks US, a subsidiary of the association, will run the Diem Payments Network and register as a money services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), while Silvergate will be the formal issuer of the Diem USD stablecoin. Silvergate will also manage the reserve backing the token.      The DPN will be a permissioned network, allowing only approved participants to transact, according to the Wednesday announcement. Silvergate already operates its own payments network, the Silvergate Exchange Network, and provides support for stablecoin transactions.      Diem, formerly known as Libra, will also move its operations out of Switzerland and withdraw its application for a Swiss Financial Markets Authority license, the press release said.      ""We are committed to a payment system that is safe for consumers and businesses, makes payments faster and cheaper, and takes advantage of blockchain technology to bring the benefits of the financial system to more people around the world. We look forward to working with Silvergate to realize this shared vision,"" Diem CEO Stuart Levey said in a statement.      The move represents a sharp departure from Diem's origins as the Libra Association, which was announced by Facebook in the summer of 2019 and formally created as a partnership with buy-in from a host of different companies in Switzerland that fall.      Diem hoped to launch a FINMA-approved product as recently as this past December.      The then-Libra Association abandoned the original stablecoin vision – as a token backed by a basket composed of different fiat currencies – after regulatory pushback from policymakers worldwide, instead choosing to launch a set of tokens, each backed by a single fiat currency.      The dollar stablecoin will be the first pilot project to launch, CNBC reported last month.

Gox exchange.      The Business and Property Courts of the High Court in London gave Ontier, and therefore Wright, permission to serve the developers of BTC, BCH, BCH ABC and BSV, even though they don’t reside in the U.K.    Read more: Craig Wright Demands Bitcoin Developers Give Him Access to Stolen Mt. Gox Coins    The actions stem from Wright’s claim that he owns billions of dollars worth of bitcoin connected to the Mt. Gox hack. The wallet (1FeexV6bAHb8ybZjqQMjJrcCrHGW9sb6uF) is connected to the hack that drained 800,000 BTC from the world’s then-most popular bitcoin exchange in 2014. Wright claims the keys to the wallets holding that bitcoin were stolen from him last year.      The defendants are the Bitcoin Association for BSV, Wladimir Van Der Laan, Jonas Schnelli, Pieter Wuille, Marco Falke, Samuel Dobson, Michael Ford, Cory Fields, George Dombrowski, Matthew Corallo, Peter Todd, Gregory Maxwell, Eric Lombrozo, Roger Ver, Amaury Sechet and Jason Cox.    Read more: Mt. Gox Victim Issues Legal Notice to Craig Wright Over Stolen Funds in 1Feex Address    “Tulip Trading is, purely and simply, a victim of theft,” said Wright's lawyers in a statement. And they are expecting developers to take steps to restore the lost funds.    Recovering access to the ‘1Feex’ wallet    As detailed in the Particulars of Claim, TTL is ""requesting that the individual developers enable TTL to regain access to and control of its bitcoin on the grounds that they, the developers, owe bitcoin owners both tortious and fiduciary duties under English law as a result of the high level of power and control they hold over their respective blockchains,” according to the lawyers.    ""The fact that someone has stolen Tulip Trading’s digitally held, encrypted private bitcoin keys does not prevent developers from deploying code to enable the rightful owner to regain control of its bitcoin.""    The lawyers' statement suggests that named developers could issue some unspecified form of code to allow Wright to gain control of the funds.      How that would be executed is unclear, and whether any nodes would accept such a deployment is even less so. To do so would likely involve creating a forked coin which, not unlike others before it, would be a different coin from bitcoin. Wright would then have to convince people to use it for it to have market value.      Further complicating the case, a law firm representing Danny Brewster, who lost funds in the Mt. Gox hack that ended up in the infamous 1Feex wallet, previously sent a letter that they might take legal action to claim any coins recovered from that wallet on behalf of victims of the Mt. Gox hack. Thus, even if Wright were to somehow succeed in recovering access to the wallets, he may not be able to keep the funds they hold.

42406355,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetyDi,1620844116,Why Bitcoin Should Be Priced in Sats (and Why It Has a Divisibility Dilemma),"Bitcoin is expensive. Too expensive, according to Mike Novogratz. People are being put off by its high price. To attract smaller savers, exchanges should switch to quoting in satoshi:      Satoshis are bitcoin’s equivalent of cents, except there are far more of them. Just as one dollar is made up of 100 cents, so one bitcoin is made up of 100 million satoshis. This is defined in the Bitcoin system’s original code.      In Bitcoin’s early days, when the bitcoin currency was only worth a few cents, no one bothered with satoshis. But now that bitcoins trade at $58,000, most people can’t afford to buy a whole bitcoin. Even those who can might not want to because bitcoin’s notorious volatility means they could lose much of their investment.      Bitcoin’s success as a store of value has been a double-edged sword. It has enriched early adopters, but in the process it has raised the barriers to entry by so much that late entrants – who tend to be younger and poorer – are finding it increasingly hard to buy in. Just like real estate, bitcoin is becoming a high-yield asset for older and richer people.    Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book, “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing,” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.    But, unlike real estate, you don’t have to buy a whole bitcoin. Increasingly, people are buying fractions of bitcoin – and fractions of bitcoin can be quoted as multiples of satoshi. People who “stack sats” (make regular small purchases to build up a holding) already talk in terms of sats rather than bitcoin. Instead of buying 0.02 bitcoin, they buy 2 million sats. How many sats have you bought today?      So there’s good reason to consider switching to satoshi as the unit of account. Quoting in satoshi rather than bitcoin could help convince people who don’t have a great deal of money that bitcoin can still be for them despite its high price. Sats can become the savings vehicle of choice for ordinary people who want a safer and higher-yielding place for their money than bank deposit accounts.      Are there enough sats for everyone to have some? In theory, yes. The world’s population is just under 8 billion. 18.5m bitcoins have already been mined, so there are 1.85 trillion sats theoretically in existence. That’s about 231 thousand for every person on the planet. On this basis, therefore, everyone can indeed save in sats.    Read more: Frances Coppola: Scarcity Gives Bitcoin Value, but Not the Way You Think    Of course, it’s not quite that simple. Of the 18.5 million mined so far, an estimated 20% are lost or otherwise irrecoverable, and a further 10 million or so are never traded. That leaves only about 4.2 million bitcoin available for purchase, either whole or subdivided. So, let’s redo the math with the number of bitcoins actually available for purchase. Instead of 1.85 trillion satoshis, there are only 0.4 trillion available for purchase. That’s about 50,000 sats per person.      And this is where the limits of subdivisibility come into play. Just because something can be divided into very small pieces doesn’t mean it is practical to do so. I might be able to slice a pizza down to atomic level, but doing so wouldn’t solve world hunger because humans need a certain amount of food to live.      Similarly, there are practical limits to how much bitcoin can be subdivided; 50,000 sats per person is not enough for everyone in the world to save in sats. And sats wouldn’t be distributed equally among small savers anyway. Realistically, people who have more money will be able to buy more sats, and this will drive up the price, pricing out those with the least money to invest. So sats can’t be the sole saving vehicle for ordinary people.      There’s another limit, too, which starts to bite much more quickly than the sats supply limit. That limit is transaction fees.      As demand for bitcoin increases, network traffic also increases, and this raises the average transaction fee. People who are buying or selling small amounts of bitcoin, and therefore don’t want to pay high fees, have to wait longer for their transactions to settle – if they ever settle at all. Higher transaction fees effectively price smaller transactions out of the market. For people with not much in the way of spare U.S. dollars, this can be a huge barrier to investing in bitcoin.    These limits to subdivisibility raise profound questions about the nature of bitcoin.    Transaction fees are already a considerable obstacle to very small investors. At bitcoin’s price of about $58,000 (at the time of writing), 50,000 sats are worth less than $29. Bitcoin’s average transaction fee is about $22 at the time of writing and has been as high as $60. So 50,000 sats would be a very expensive purchase. Furthermore, holdings smaller than this can’t be sold, because the holder doesn’t own enough bitcoin to pay the transaction fee. They are known as “dust.” The higher the average transaction fee rises, the more dust accumulates in the Bitcoin ecosystem.      Layer 2 solutions aim to resolve the “dust” problem by taking small transactions off-chain. But I do wonder why the savings and transactions of ordinary people apparently don’t need the same anonymity, security and immutability as those of the rich. Surely we should be protecting the wealth of ordinary people who can’t afford to lose money, not the wealth of big whales for whom losses are a flea bite?    Read more: Frances Coppola - Crypto’s Choice: Join the Financial System or Fight It    These limits to subdivisibility raise profound questions about the nature of bitcoin. What exactly does the community want it to be? Do they want it to be a reserve asset underpinning a new international payments system similar to the gold standards of the past, or do they want it to be the preferred safe savings vehicle of ordinary people?      This is essentially the same dilemma the Bitcoin community faced in the “blocksize wars” of 2015-2017. Then, the argument was over whether bitcoin should accommodate the world’s transactions, or whether it should simply be the base layer underpinning a new generation of transaction systems. Those who wanted it to be a base layer won the wars, but didn’t resolve the fundamental dilemma. That has now re-emerged in the form of an argument about whether bitcoin should accommodate the world’s savings.      Subdividing into sats will resolve this dilemma for a while. But if Bitcoin continues on the path set in the outcome of the “blocksize wars,” then transaction fees will eventually be far too high for ordinary people to save significantly in sats. So Bitcoin will need layer 2 solutions not just for transactions, but for savings. New products that can provide the security needed by people who can’t afford to lose money.      The crypto world is a hugely creative and innovative place. I am confident there can be a solution to this dilemma. I just hope it will be one that works in the best interests of the poor.

42406361,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetyId,1620838846,The Node: Too Musk Power for One Man,"“Some are born mad, some achieve madness, and some have madness thrust upon 'em.”      When the author Emile Autumn wrote this riff on Shakespeare a decade ago, one wonders if she ever envisaged a day when a Shiba Inu-inspired cryptocurrency would sweep the globe. Perhaps, but I have my doubts.      Either way, madness has very much been thrust upon us.    This is a guest essay from cryptocurrency researcher John Mac Ghlionn for The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Dogecoin, a decentralized cryptocurrency, is a “satirical alternative” to the more serious cryptocurrencies, like ethereum and bitcoin. However, it’s important to remember that satire is, in many ways, an exaggerated edifice built upon a foundation of reality. With bitcoin, the first-ever cryptocurrency, Satoshi Nakamoto implemented a highly sophisticated framework for decentralized finance to flourish. Bitcoin is a serious digital currency, and bitcoin enthusiasts tend to be serious people.      Dogecoin, on the other hand, is a meme coin. It’s a joke. It was designed to generate a few laughs. Now, however, doge has generated a cult-like following. And Elon Musk has played a huge role in facilitating the coin’s rise in status.      On May 7, after climbing more than 26,000% in value since its inception, doge had a market capitalization of roughly $92 billion. With “The Dogefather” scheduled to host ""Saturday Night Live"" the next day, the rise was expected to continue.      Things, however, took a nasty turn when Musk, during a segment dedicated to doge, admitted that it was little more than a “hustle.” Almost immediately, the cryptocurrency’s price plunged by more than 30% in value. Twenty-four hours later, obviously feeling guilty about the joke (a Freudian slip?), Musk took to Twitter. He was seeking redemption.    Read more: Opinion: What’s New Is Old    The Tesla CEO, who appears to enjoy “breaking” the internet, posed a rather provocative question to his 42.2 million followers: “Do you want Tesla to accept Doge?” And 77% of respondents said “yes.” Almost immediately after the tweet, doge’s value increased by 10%.      Is doge the future of finance? After all, fate loves irony. With dogecoin, however, there is just one problem, and it’s a major one. The problem is Elon Musk.    No Musk, No DOGE    If he passes away tomorrow, the cryptocurrency will die the quickest of deaths. This logic, I argue, is also applicable to Tesla. If Musk goes, so, too, will the allure of Tesla.      This is why bitcoin, for all its flaws, is a far more stable alternative to DOGE. Nobody knows who Satoshi is. Is ""he"" an individual? Is ""he"" a group of people? Is ""he"" alive? All of these questions are somewhat interesting, but they are irrelevant when it comes to bitcoin’s stability. Whether or not Satoshi is around doesn’t matter in the slightest. Bitcoin is the star of the show. Furthermore, its success is not tied to the sentiments of one individual.      Whether or not Musk, the most successful entrepreneur in the world, is serious about dogecoin is debatable. Nevertheless, doge’s value is not. The Musk tweets and the exaggerated value of dogecoin display all the characteristics associated with a classic pump-and-dump scheme. Musk almost single-handedly has artificially inflated doge’s price, but the artificial inflation can’t go on forever. Eventually, like Icarus falling to his death, doge’s price will spiral downward, swiftly and unceremoniously.    Whether or not Satoshi is around doesn’t matter in the slightest. Bitcoin is the star of the show.    Now, I understand that it’s very easy to get carried away with the hype. You might have heard about the 33-year-old man from Los Angeles who recently became a millionaire after investing in dogecoin. Glauber Contessoto invested most of his life savings, somewhere in the region of $180,000, in doge. Most people don’t have that sort of money lying around. More recently, a managing director at Goldman Sachs in London reportedly left the financial institution after making a fortune on doge. Like Contessoto, one assumes Aziz McMahon, who was with the brokerage firm for 14 years, also invested a small fortune in the cryptocurrency. This part of the story, somewhat predictably, gets omitted from the “get rich quick” narrative. There is little room for nuance in the world of canine-inspired lunacy.      But nuance is the very thing that is needed. Caution must be exercised. A positive correlation exists between dogecoin’s value and Elon Musk’s Twitter activity. If the tweets decrease in frequency, doge’s value will dip. If the positive tweets stop, doge will die.    Read more: Opinion – Dogecoin: From Shiba Inu to Scapegoat    This is the Catch-22 situation doge finds itself in. It can’t survive without Elon; at the same time, doge has become far too reliant on the entrepreneur for “cultural oxygen.” When it comes to whether or not doge survives, Elon Musk will decide. After all, he is the cryptocurrency's judge, jury and potential executioner. His verdict is all that really matters.",NEGATIVE,DOGE,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOGE | SHIB | TRADING,John Mac Ghlionn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/12/the-node-too-musk-power-for-one-man,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/538233521a34fa163855712c476d6e10c49e2fbf-2048x1534.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A victim of its own success, Ethereum, the home of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and a bunch of other stuff, has become rather congested of late with very high transaction fees. As a result, projects are exploring faster, cheaper so-called layer 2 solutions such as Polygon (formerly known as Matic).      ""We've been in closed beta on Ethereum and Polygon for a few months now. But today's launch is Polygon only,” Slingshot CEO Clinton Bembry said in an interview. “So there won't be any Ethereum trading, it will only be on Polygon's network.”      Bembry said Ethereum trading would be added further down the line but that for now, “insane transaction fees” were effectively pricing people out of DeFi. (For example, a trade that might cost some $300 in transaction fees on Ethereum would cost about five-thousandths of a penny on Polygon, Bembry said.)

As a DEX aggregator, the aim is to help users find the best price for any given token trade, a service also provided by the likes of 1inch, ParaSwap, 0x’s Matcha and even the prominent Ethereum wallet MetaMask.      To get started trading on Slingshot, users will need to bridge assets from Ethereum to Polygon, Bembry said.      “We are not wanting to take a shot at Ethereum, which is very much in Slingshot’s DNA,” he said. “This is just the first step in our public launch and we plan to support other layer 2s in the future to like Arbitrum and Optimism, and I'm sure there'll be other good ones as well.”",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | EXCHANGE | MATIC | TRADING | ZRX,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/12/slingshot-picks-ethereum-layer-2-polygon-for-full-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/39701bdd3efa799a5dda715bbd1d8204760c8e49-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406357,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetyCj,1620837602,Hybrid Banknotes Can Bridge Cash and Crypto,"As central bank digital currencies (CBDC) become reality and the use of cryptocurrencies for payments becomes more mainstream, how do we make sure these new digital monies are available to everyone, everywhere, at all times? To date, the only payment technology that can do this is cash.      The pure physicality of banknotes presents problems in the digital age. International remittances are slow, holding banknotes can be costly and problematic, and cash can impede central bank monetary policy (such as by breaking the zero lower bound in interest rates).    Franklin Noll, PhD, is a recognized authority on the history of money, including banknotes and cryptocurrency. He has extensively written and spoken upon these topics, and he is the president of Noll Historical Consulting.    It seems only logical that an ideal payment instrument would combine the advantages of banknotes and digital currencies. A hybrid banknote would use a universally accepted and robust payment technology – cash – to deliver the cutting-edge benefits of digital money. A hybrid banknote – for instance, a bill with a chip embedded – could routinely function as a banknote does currently, but have the ability to access an electronic network to transfer value.    Fulfill pressing needs    A hybrid banknote would act as a transitional device between cash and digital monies such as CBDCs. It would gradually replace current banknotes and exist alongside current smartphone technology until no longer needed.      For people who want or need to use cash because they just prefer banknotes or they do not have a bank account, a hybrid banknote will allow them to continue using cash. It will also give users the option to use a hybrid banknote’s electronic capabilities. At the same time, a hybrid banknote will fulfill the promise made by central banks that cash will exist alongside CBDCs.      Further, the continued use of banknotes will prevent the disintermediation of the cash industry. And hybrid banknotes will facilitate the application of new central bank policies that would require money with smart contracts.      Hybrid banknotes would also provide for offline, anonymous transactions. However, when connected to an electronic network, anonymity would be determined by the design of the digital side of the hybrid banknote.    Hybrid banknotes types    There are currently three types of hybrid banknotes being worked on by developers, including myself and designer Andrei Lipkin: smart banknotes, cryptoNotes and crypto bills.      A smart banknote is a traditional banknote that talks to an electronic network via one or more RFID chips. Using a smartphone, a point of sale device, or other reader, its value can be moved back and forth on an electronic network. The status of the smart banknote, whether it contains its face value or not is indicated by an icon formed by electronic ink on the note.      Imagine a $10 US smart banknote. It would circulate hand to hand, being used in transactions or vending machines. No access to an electronic network is necessary. Everyone would know this $10 bill contains its value because the value icon is visible on the note.      Perhaps the smart banknote user then needs to transfer the $10 to their bank account, and so on. The user touches the note to his or her phone and transfers the value over a network. The value icon then disappears, indicating the smart banknote no longer has value.    Read more: JP Koning: Can Decentralized Stablecoins Stabilize?    The user can then turn the smart $10 bill into a bank that will recharge the note and reintroduce it into circulation. Or, users can recharge it themselves by transferring $10 back on to the bill. At this point, the value icon would appear, indicating the smart banknote bears its face value. Then the smart $10 can continue circulating hand to hand.      A cryptonote is a hybrid banknote that bears the public and private keys to access a cryptocurrency account. Cryptonotes can pass hand to hand until a user wants to transfer the value of the note electronically.      A £10 note, for example, would bear all the attributes it now has, but a removable silver foil patch would be added. Underneath would be the private key in QR form. The note would also have a visible QR code that would be the public key. Everyone would know this £10 contains its value because the foil patch is intact, evidence that no one has accessed the private key necessary to transfer its value electronically.      When cryptonote users need to complete an electronic transaction, they scratch off the foil patch to reveal the private key. Then, using their phone, the user scans the QR codes for the public and private keys, accessing the corresponding wallet. The £10 can then be transferred.      Now, with the foil patch and the value removed from the note, the cryptonote can no longer be used. And, because of the physical damage to the note, it cannot be reissued. The lost foil patch also makes it evident to everyone that the note no longer has value.      A crypto-bill is a hybrid banknote that bears only the public key of the cryptocurrency holdings of the issuer. The private keys to individual accounts are held by the note issuer. Crypto-bills can pass hand-to-hand until a user wants to transfer the value of the note to an electronic account. The note must then be taken to the issuer or its representative to have the value represented by the note transferred. This action does not involve the actual note but only the cryptocurrency accounts holding the backing value for all crypto-bills. As a result, the note can be reissued repeatedly and can circulate until worn out.      A crypto-bill would look very similar to existing banknotes. However, the note would require a QR code, bearing a public key, but no chips or removable foil patches are needed.      Like a current banknote, the crypto-bill would repeatedly pass hand to hand and be used in transactions or vending machines. No access to an electronic network is necessary. As with current banknotes, there is no need to determine whether the note actually holds value because that is irrelevant. A crypto-bill, like a current dollar, euro or pound, is simply a token for its underlying currency. As a result, users are only concerned with the authenticity of the note as they are with current banknotes.    Conclusion    Transcending the division between banknotes and digital money through a hybrid banknote will bring many advantages to central banks and cryptocurrency advocates. Such banknotes will use a universally accepted and robust payment technology, cash, to deliver the cutting-edge benefits of digital money, passing hand to hand until used to access an electronic network to transfer value.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Franklin Noll,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/12/hybrid-banknotes-can-bridge-cash-and-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a0b6761db4ec45f9237de0f0c79b4e8220b21d5-1400x773.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406371,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetyRU,1620834565,"Fairlead's Stockton Warns of Bitcoin Correction to $42K, Based on Technical Analysis","Bitcoin (BTC) remains in a state of calm, but not social media. Ever since Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared the pic of his pet goat named Bitcoin on Tuesday, the Crypto Twitterati are abuzz with speculation and predicting a moon shot for the biggest cryptocurrency by market value.      But one analyst studying patterns in price charts says the cryptocurrency may suffer a deeper pullback before resuming the uptrend. The prediction is based on the MACD histogram's recent drop below zero (bearish turn) on the weekly price chart.      ""The weekly MACD rollover reflects a loss of intermediate-term momentum that increases risk the recent price range resolves to the downside,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, told CoinDesk in an email.      MACD, which is the shortened form of ""moving average convergence divergence,"" is an indicator widely used to gauge trend strength and trend changes. The indicator's cross below zero is taken to represent a bearish reversal, while a move into the positive territory signifies bullish trend change.      Having crossed below zero in mid-April, the histogram is now lowest since April 2018, implying the strongest bearish signal in three years.      The MACD has been a fairly reliable indicator of intermediate price action in the past. For example, the cryptocurrency charted significant price declines after the MACD crossed bearishly in 2014, November 2018 and August 2019 (represented by vertical lines in the above chart).      Thus, the possibility of a deeper bull market drawdown cannot be ruled out. ""We are watching $42,000 as support,"" Stockton said.      Other technical indicators are also pointing to near-term pain. For example, Fairlead's weekly note published Monday cited an active ""sell"" signal from the ""DeMARK Indicators"" as a cause for concern for the bulls along with the MACD's bearish turn.      According to Investopedia, DeMark indicators compare the most recent maximum and minimum prices to the previous period's equivalent price to measure the demand of the underlying asset.      ""With the weekly MACD on a 'sell' signal and an active 'sell' signal from the DeMARK Indicators (mid-April), it will be difficult for resistance in the $62K-$65K area to be surmounted,"" Stockton said in the weekly note.      Bitcoin's bull market has already slowed, with prices stuck largely in the range of $50,000 to $60,000 over the past two months. The retail-led rally to record highs above $64,000 seen ahead of Coinbase's Nasdaq debut on April 14 was short-lived.      The cryptocurrency was showing few signs of life on Wednesday despite speculation that Facebook may follow the U.S. electric car maker Tesla's lead and add the cryptocurrency to its balance sheet.      ""We may see a series of announcements of bitcoin purchases from institutions like Facebook soon,"" Ki Young Ju, CEO of the blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, tweeted. ""Institutions have been accumulating bitcoin in the $48,000 to $60,000 range since February.""      Bitcoin was trading near $56,300 at press time, having printed a high of $58,041 early today. Buyers have recently failed to keep gains above $59,000, while the downside has been restricted near $53,000.      The cryptocurrency may pick up a strong bid if the likes of Facebook disclose or announce plans to invest in bitcoin, as anticipated by Ju.      ""The fact that bitcoin continues to fail at resistance at $58,000 is not a good sign, and the visuals now hint at a head and shoulders top,"" said Bill Noble, chief technical analyst at Token Metrics, a cryptocurrency research company.      A potential drop to $48,000 would mark the completion of the head-and-shoulders pattern. A break below that level would open the doors to $30,000, according to Noble.      That said, both Stockton and Noble are long-term bulls and expect price dips, if any, to recharge engines for a continued bull run.      ""With bitcoin and ether, we believe that you should not sell the dip,"" Noble said. ""So, I would focus less on major topping formations and more on horizontal support points to get involved.""

Being added to ConsenSys' Infura and Truffle products, alongside Ethereum and IFPS, allows developers to program and run dapps on Polygon's network as easily as they would on a cloud platform, according to an announcement Wednesday.  Infura enables developers to connect to Ethereum via an API without having to run a full node, and it underpins the majority of dapps on the network.  Polygon, formerly known as Matic, is now looking to offer this same accessibility to the decentralized finance (DeFi)-focused protocols it supports.  Truffle, meanwhile, brings tools that help developers build and deploy their dapps, like boilerplate projects.  Polygon recently announced the launch of a $100 million “#DeFiforAll” fund to make DeFi more accessible to a larger number of users in the face of mounting Ethereum gas fees.

The DAO, launched earlier this week, now plans to begin acquiring rare NFTs for fractionalization through Unicly, another newcomer to Ethereum’s busy digital collectibles space. Other NFT DAOs are already on the scene, having made flashy purchases in January in the run-up to NFT mania.      JennyDAO’s fractionalization approach aims to put a distributed spin on the gilded halls of high-end NFT ownership. Pricey non-fungibles are, by their nature, inherently singular, and the most sought-after pieces can go for millions of dollars. But by fractionalizing a collection of valuable NFTs JennyDAO says it can make rare internet art more “accessible.”      “You could have a bunch of small NFTs but together within the collection it's worth a lot more,” project lead Jae Chung told CoinDesk. “Therefore people will be interested in getting exposure to the collection,” he added, comparing it to an exchange-traded fund (ETF).    Read more: 11 Projects at the Nexus of DeFi and NFTs    Chung said anyone with the project’s uJENNY governance token will get a say in the collection’s shape. Thirty-six percent of uJENNY’s 10 million token supply will go to the DAO’s launch community.      “We want to increase accessibility and basically whatever amazing collection we make, the value and upside of it is shared by the supporters,” he said.      Those supporters include a number of notable crypto VCs, Chung said: 0xb1, IOSG Ventures, Moonrock Capital, Morningstar Ventures, Spartan Group, 3Commas, Vendetta Capital, Hillrise Ventures and Building Blocks. Each VC chipped into JennyDAO’s $7 million launch pool.      JennyDAO plans to keep its NFT collection in smart contracts on Unicly, an Ethereum-based protocol that specializes in fractionalized NFTs. Works will be added into Jenny’s Unicly vault based on simple majority votes, according to a blog post. Proceeds of a full liquidation would be divided up among governance token-holders, the white paper said.      “Fractionalization protocols allow access to liquidity of a patron/curator holding a collection, and reward retail collectors for recognizing the value of a collection and getting exposure to a fraction of it,” Multicoin partner Mable Jiang said in a Telegram message.      “JennyDAO, in this case, is a realization of the idea of ‘patronage as an asset class,’” she added.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | ZRX,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/12/dao-raises-7m-to-acquire-and-fractionalize-nft-collections,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01ec0def71c6fad11c17237094dad8fb4e48bd01-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the Wednesday announcement, the funds will focus on four separate markets: Brazil, Russia, India and Ukraine. Hacken, Gate.io, Coin DCX and BRZ will make investments to support projects working on the development of blockchain applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces and cybersecurity, according to a representative. The Solana Foundation will not be directly benefiting from the investments; the funds will go directly to different initiatives within the Solana ecosystem.      Earlier this month, five investment funds worth $100 million launched to drive Solana growth and development in China.      The Solana Foundation has worked with crypto firms in the new markets to support the development of new projects built on the Solana blockchain.      “In each of these regions we’ve seen strong engagement in Discord, local Telegram groups and other community spaces, so we set out to find partners in those regions,” Anatoly Yakovenko, president of the foundation, told CoinDesk in a written statement.      Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are being adopted more and more in emerging markets. For instance, despite regulatory uncertainty, crypto assets are being used as speculative tools and stores-of-value in Brazil and India. In 2020, Ukraine topped the global crypto adoption index compiled by blockchain research firm Chainalysis.      In Brazil, Solana has partnered with Brazilian Digital Token (BRZ). According to the announcement, BRZ’s fund will support projects that are developing real-world DeFi applications focused on lending, financing and payments.      “Working with Solana will bring innovation and tackle inefficiencies inherent to the Brazilian financial system,” Thiago Cesar, CEO of Transfera Swiss, the creator of the Brazilian stablecoin, said in a press statement.      Solana’s partner in India is CoinDCX, and the fund is set to support projects building new Web 3.0 products, including DeFi systems, NFT marketplaces, wallets, exchanges and decentralized apps (dApps) on top of Solana.      The remaining fund, coming from Hacken and Gate.io, will focus on cybersecurity and DeFi projects in Ukraine and Russia, a foundation representative told CoinDesk.      The representative also said the Solana Foundation doesn’t provide regulatory guidance to anyone building on its blockchain, adding there are no preset minimums or maximums for investments in projects.      The funds are being allocated to projects built on Solana in these markets, the representative said.      UPDATE (May 13, 2021, 16:47 UTC): After the publication of this article, the Solana Foundation said it was combining the Hacken and Gate.io funds, meaning it's only launching three in total. Updated to clarify Solana is working with four parties to launch the funds.

42434342,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPByzh,1620826515,MoneyGram to Allow Bitcoin Buying and Selling Across Retail Network,"MoneyGram International said Wednesday it will allow customers to buy and sell bitcoin for cash at 12,000 U.S. retail locations through a partnership with Coinme.      The cash transfer company plans to introduce bitcoin trades in 20,000 stores across 32 states by Q3, Coinme CEO Neil Bergquist told CoinDesk. His crypto firm already facilitates cash-for-bitcoin swaps at around 6,000 supermarket kiosks.      MoneyGram and Coinme will take 4% of customers’ transactions plus $2.75 in fees. Walmart-based MoneyGram locations will charge $2 more, he said.      The rollout vastly expands U.S. investors’ access to brick-and-mortar crypto touchpoints. According to Coin ATM Radar, fewer than 3,000 crypto kiosks and tellers allow users to sell their bitcoin in person, though nearly 17,000 locations facilitate buys.      Moneygram had recently hinted the service was in the works.      “The ability for anyone to walk into a MoneyGram location and load that wallet or unload that wallet is a pretty exciting service opportunity,” CEO Alex Holmes said on the company’s early May earnings call.      Until recently a major partner of Ripple Labs, MoneyGram received tens of millions of dollars to use the XRP token for cross-border transactions. The relationship ended in March after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit against Ripple Labs last year.    That's life    During an appearance on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" Wednesday, Holmes reflected on the breakup.      ""It's unfortunate what happened with Ripple,"" he said. ""It was a great pilot for us and really moved us, I think, progressively forward in blockchain.""      However, he cited ""the challenges that they're facing today with the SEC and government regulation, which continues to be a big topic in the crypto space,"" adding that ""it made it very difficult to continue to operate particularly in the United States, but we'll see where that goes down the road.""    Steady as she goes    Holmes also hinted that MoneyGram may be looking at a way for its customers to use stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to hold its value against a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar.      When asked directly, the MoneyGram CEO responded, ""One press release at a time and one partnership at a time.""      It appears something may already be in the works with Coinme; Bergquist, who also appeared on the show, was asked if his company could ""flip a switch"" to give MoneyGram customers access to stablecoins. He said his company has something ""under development to support other cryptocurrencies which we'll be adding, so we'll have a future press release for MoneyGram to run with in the future.""      Holmes called stablecoins a ""super interesting"" and ""dynamic opportunity"" given currency volatility in markets like Latin America, Africa and Asia.

The latest reading on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report exceeded economists' average estimate for a 3.6% increase, and it compares with a 2.6% increase reported last month.      The CPI report is particularly important for some cryptocurrency investors who view bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against inflation and ongoing currency debasement. However, concerns about higher inflation beyond the 2% threshold could cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, which could weigh on risk assets.    On a month-to-month basis, headline April CPI increased 0.8%, beating expectations for a 0.2% rise after a 0.6% gain in March.  The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.9% in April, its largest monthly increase since April 1982, according to the BLS.  Nearly all major components of the CPI increased in April, including prices for used cars, trucks, shelter and airline fares – a sign that pent-up demand is fueling a rebound in economic mobility.    U.S. stocks slumped for a third day and bond yields rose after the report. As of press time, bitcoin (BTC) was down 1% since 0:00 coordinated universal time.      ""The Fed is not going to panic after one startling CPI report, so you can expect to hear even more about transitory bottleneck inflation pressures over the next few weeks,"" wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in an email. ""But this report does mean that the first part of the higher inflation story - the reopening spike - is real.""

Big Time raised $10.3 million in a Series A funding round from such investors as North Island Ventures, Digital Currency Group (the owner of CoinDesk), OKEx's Blockdream Ventures, Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research, USDC builder Circle and Ashton Kutcher's Sound Ventures, according to an announcement on Wednesday. An additional $11 million in funding that will be used to invest in partner gaming companies is almost complete, the company said.      Online video games have been around forever, but they tend to be ""Walled Gardens,"" which means they are enclosed so that the user is restricted to certain websites or online services. Thanks to crypto going mainstream, especially with all the interest around non-fungible tokens (NFTs), it’s time for the gaming world to break through its silos.      Big Time CEO Ari Meilich, who was previously a co-founder and CEO at Decentraland, a virtual reality platform that is built on blockchain technology, says he plans to create the first ""AAA,"" or highly rated, action title that allows players to acquire, hold and trade NFT-based virtual items with ease.    NFTs’ next step    In 2018, Meilich organized “Nifty,” the first blockchain gaming and NFT conference, where he gained firsthand experience of the sort of complications users run into when they deal with blockchains, wallets, cryptocurrencies and NFTs.      “We knew for a fact that this couldn’t scale in the short term to a mass market audience,” Meilich said in an interview, adding:    “So we are building tech that gives regular players who know nothing about crypto, access to their blockchain-based virtual goods. That means providing hosted wallets and a fully managed experience where we custody their assets, and also taking a lot of the transactions off-chain to save on gas.”    Meilich said the project is being built on Ethereum but with “proprietary tech to scale off-chain.”    Read more: The People of Decentraland Will Greet You Now    Meilich is joined by former Decentraland compatriot Thor Alexander and a founding team that includes key players from games such as ""World of Warcraft,"" ""Call of Duty"" and ""League of Legends.""      “The market for in-game assets is massive, and yet in today’s world, players do not possess and usually cannot trade the items they purchase,” North Island Ventures managing partner Travis Scher said in a statement. “In-game NFTs can give players true ownership and their proliferation can bring the Metaverse one step closer to fruition.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MANA | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/12/decentraland-founder-unveils-project-of-bringing-nfts-to-big-time-video-games,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0ab1dda3770ad555f64153108b681c9d2415820-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434348,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPBz9h,1620819000,"Valid Points: MEV on Eth 2.0: The Good, Bad and Ugly","The 14th MEV Roast was hosted this past Thursday, May 6, at the Scaling Ethereum Summit.      MEV Roasts are a monthly discussion organized by the research and development group Flashbots to promote greater understanding of and discussion on the topic of Maximal or Miner Extractable Value (MEV) on Ethereum.      The first half of the roast was centered around how MEV could impact staking dynamics on Ethereum 2.0. This week, we’ll break down the good, the bad and the ugly about MEV on proof-of-stake (PoS).    Pulse check: Ethereum fees hit all-time high  Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics    It’s more expensive than ever to use the Ethereum blockchain.      On Monday, May 10, average daily fees on Ethereum reached a new all-time high of $51.84. The rise in fees is largely due to bullish price activity inflating the costs of sending transactions on the network.      In native units, average fees are trending at roughly 0.013 ETH but have in the past trended as high as 0.03 ETH. The issue of high fees on Ethereum stems from the network’s limited block capacity which processes just under 20 transactions per second (TPS). In comparison, payments giant Visa processes on average 2,000 TPS.      Contrary to what you may have heard, upcoming upgrades on Ethereum such as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 and the merge to proof-of-stake will not significantly impact network fees or scalability. EIP 1559 is designed primarily to improve the predictability of fees, not reduce them, while Ethereum’s merge aims to reduce network energy consumption by removing the need for mining. PoS alone is not a solution for increasing block capacity.      There are upgrades scheduled tentatively for 2022 that build on EIP 1559 and PoS that are aimed at making Ethereum more scalable and competitive with the likes of Visa but in the near-term, high fees are an unfortunate reality that users are stuck with.      For Eth 2.0 validators, who presently only earn network rewards in the form of new coin issuance, high fees mean a greater future return on their investment. As of Tuesday, May 11, CoinDesk’s validator operations are estimated to earn around 8% annual percentage return (APR).      After the merge to PoS, transaction fees normally awarded to miners will be pocketed by validators. Ben Edgington, lead product owner of Ethereum 2.0 software client Teku at ConsenSys, estimated that validator returns are likely to jump to 25% APR.      It’s not only high fees Eth 2.0 validators will profit from once they take over the process of transaction validation and finalization from Ethereum miners completely. They’ll also inherit the ability to extract additional value from users by ordering and reordering transactions on blocks.      This is traditionally called Maximal or Miner Extractable Value (MEV).    New frontiers: How MEV works    The ordering of transactions matters on Ethereum particularly to traders on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The reason here is that executing a trade first, even milliseconds ahead of another trader, is sometimes all that matters and all that stands in the way of either making thousands of dollars or losing thousands of dollars.      Miners have the ability to earn more rewards from these types of users on Ethereum who value the speed and order in which their transactions are executed on the blockchain more than the average user does. Miners also have the ability to take advantage of profit-making opportunities themselves if they are knowledgeable about the crypto markets and how DeFi protocols work. The most common source of MEV for miners is through identifying arbitrage opportunities within and among DEXs.      MEV is the amount of money a miner on Ethereum, and eventually a validator on Ethereum, can stand to make as a direct result of their ability to insert, leave out and reorder transactions within a block.      Over the last 30 days, Ethereum miners have made over $140 million from MEV income, according to research by Flashbots. Of this MEV income, 46% is extracted from traders on Uniswap, which is one of Ethereum’s largest DEXs by total value locked.    How MEV impacts Eth 2.0    MEV income, as mentioned in a previous Valid Points issue, is not going away once Ethereum 2.0 validators take over the responsibility of transaction sequencing from miners after the transition to PoS.      In fact, analysis by Alex Obadia, researcher for Flashbots, estimates that Eth 2.0 validators stand to earn 1.93 ETH per year, or 70.9% more than what they are currently earning from network rewards alone, with the addition of MEV income.      This income opportunity for validators will have two main effects, according to Obadia.      First, higher validator incomes are likely to attract more users to stake their ether and become validators. The more active validators there are on Ethereum, the greater the overall security of the network.      Second, because MEV can only be extracted by the validators who are proposing blocks and writing transactions into blocks, the variance in income between validators who are randomly assigned block proposal responsibilities versus validators who are assigned other responsibilities such as attestations will increase significantly.      At present, without MEV income, Zelda, CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 validator, earns roughly 15% more in network rewards every time she is randomly selected for a block proposal.      Once Zelda is able to write in real user transactions onto the blocks she is proposing post-merge with PoS, additional MEV income is likely to widen the difference in income between days she has the opportunity to create blocks on the network and days she does not.      The chart above illustrates the gap in income between the unluckiest 1% of validators who are randomly selected to produce (at most) 15 blocks in a year (yellow line) versus the luckiest 1% of validators who are selected to produce over 39 blocks in a year. The minor difference is what results without factoring in MEV income.      The chart below illustrates the same gap in income between the unluckiest 1% of validators (yellow line) and the luckiest 1% of validators (blue line) with MEV income.      Greater variance in validator income raises important questions about the dynamics of staking on Ethereum under PoS.      “Does it exert pressure for pooling dynamics to happen? Because you want to smooth out that variance of luck,” said Obadia in a presentation on Thursday at Scaling Ethereum. “Does it mean that MEV is prohibitive to being a solo validator or does it exert additional pressure for oligopoly dynamics to form? [Because] people that have a large validator stake will have more blocks that they propose, they will get more MEV rewards from that and then they will have more ether and then they can stake more. That kind of cycle.”      Flashbots is one of many organizations and businesses actively researching the impact of MEV on Ethereum and its future as a PoS protocol. When it comes to developing solutions to mitigate MEV because of centralization risks and other negative externalities to the Ethereum network, Phil Daian, another researcher for the Flashbots projects, warns users and protocol developers against “silver bullet solutions.”      “We can reduce [MEV] in a lot of ways with smart dapp design,” said Daian in a separate presentation at Scaling Ethereum. “[But] we need to beware people who are trying to sell silver bullet solutions saying this one protocol, whatever the protocol might be, will eliminate MEV for all use cases … because it’s still going to exist in the cryptocurrency world no matter what you do.”    Validated takes  Ebay allows sale of NFTs on Ethereum (Article, CoinDesk)  Is ether headed toward a trillion-dollar market cap?

""We do not expect [Coinbase] to report any news from [the first quarter of this year] that could justify owning shares at current levels.""      Coinbase is expected to report its first earnings on Thursday. Yet, even though the exchange has posted impressive year-over-year revenue of around $500 million and an increase in users, the research firm still believes the stock will continue to slump over the long term.      See also: Coinbase Debuts ‘Buy With PayPal’ Feature (but Read the Fine Print)      ""No earnings report, in our opinion, will be strong enough to convince investors the company will exceed the extraordinary expectations for profits already baked into the current price,"" wrote Trainer.      The CEO also pointed to rising competition in the crypto trading space and tapering of profits for Coinbase that could lead to an unsustainable valuation.      New York Investment firm Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau disagrees, rating the stock as ""outperform"" in a note on Monday. Oppenheimer said Coinbase removes ""pain points"" in finance and set a price target of $434 per share over 12–18 month period.      See also: NYSE-Owner ICE Sold Coinbase Stake for $1.2B      But the recent performance gains have done little to convince Trainer, who wrote Coinbase had ""more downside risk ahead.""      Coinbase stock has fallen 12% since debuting on the Nasdaq in mid-April with an opening price of around $381. Up 20% from May 6 lows of around $250, Coinbase shares recently traded at $303, with buyers showing some signs of life.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | RESEARCH,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/12/investment-research-firm-says-coinbase-stock-could-fall-to-100,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d37b86997836d40496cc7ab6947033b0c5e0d904-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
