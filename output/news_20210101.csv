Richard Chen, the creator of CryptoArt.io, told CoinDesk, ""Crypto natives are starting to understand the value NFTs bring to verifying authenticity of the original artwork. Furthermore, big-name digital artists like Beeple are discovering what NFTs are and how they open up a new business model for artists other than commissions.""  CryptoArt.io tracks numerous digital art market places such as Async Art, KnownOrigin, MakersPlace, SuperRare and Nifty Gateway, which was acquired by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss in 2019.  Most NFT purchases are made using ether or Ethereum-based stablecoins but some platforms such as Nifty Gateway and MakersPlace accept credit card payments as well, said Chen.

While Bittrex gave no reason for the removals, exchanges around the world have been moving to delist coins that seek to preserve the privacy of their users as a way to be compliant with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations that are spreading around the world.  For instance, the U.S. Secret Service has urged Congress to create ways to limit the use of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies.  Dash responded via Tweet, calling the label ""privacy coin"" a misnomer in its case, saying, ""From a technical standpoint, dash's privacy functionality is no greater than bitcoin's.""

42385500,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB24Kt,1609516847,"Stablecoins, 'Unsung Heroes' and Other Institutional Crypto Takeaways","It is clear that crypto is having its institutional moment. The investment decision is moving from speculation to allocation, and we are witnessing the maturation of crypto and digital asset investors in the process. In formalizing a dedicated digital asset investment strategy, institutional investors should assess the landscape thoughtfully with the goal of building an optimally constructed portfolio to achieve their desired investment objectives. Below, we summarize our top 10 takeaways from 2020 for institutional investors, based on our recent report “An Institutional Take on the 2020/2021 Digital Asset Market.”    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Dan Zuller, CFA, is a partner at Vision Hill Group, an investment consultant and asset manager in digital assets.    1. Active management roars back.      Following a challenging 2019 market in which concentration in bitcoin (largely viewed as the market’s beta, or its headline volatility indicator) prevailed over distinctive asset diversification, active management came roaring back in 2020. According to VisionTrack data as of October 2020, crypto hedge funds generated net returns of +116% on average, outperforming bitcoin (+92%) by approximately 2,400 basis points (bps).      2. For investors, 2020 was the year of DeFi and asset selection.      DeFi stands for decentralized finance and can be best thought of as an emerging sector within the frontier digital asset market. Total value locked in DeFi contracts surged 25x to ~$15 billion as of the end of November, from ~$600 million in January. Investors that put capital to work in this thematic sector of digital assets generally outperformed bitcoin and the digital asset market beta in 2020.      3. Digital asset yields are sustainable, for now.      Digital assets offer highly attractive yields compared to traditional market instruments such as high-yield savings accounts. Will that continue? Growing demand from institutional counterparties and borrowers such as hedge funds, over-the-counter (OTC) desks, market makers and liquidity providers leads us to believe these yields are sustainable for the foreseeable future.      4. The remarkable rise, fall and rise again of crypto derivatives.      After a challenging 2018-2019 market regime, crypto derivatives have made a fascinating comeback in 2020. CME BTC daily futures volumes recently peaked at $2.2 billion at the end of November 2020 while Bakkt BTC daily futures volumes peaked at $178 million in September. “First a trickle and then a flood,” once the industry’s mantra back in 2018-2019, has proven true in 2020.      5. Crypto hedge funds are institutionalizing, but some more than others.      There are now a variety of beta- and alpha-focused hedge fund strategies rising to institutional “gold standards” in preparation for 2021. However, not all managers are evolving with the times. According to our VisionTrack database, approximately one in four managers have shuttered their funds since 2017 as a result of failed operations.      6. There’s liquid and there’s venture, but liquid venture is a tougher pitch.      The distinction between liquid hedge fund strategies (primarily liquid, short-term) and illiquid venture fund strategies (primarily illiquid, long-term) continues to be clear. However, the digital asset market continues to have hybrid “liquid venture” funds that attempt to capture the best of both the liquid and private worlds. While the opportunity set for such funds is certainly expanded, such strategies are not without their complexities and challenges.      7. Simplicity prevails: How the easy trades continue to win (and scale).      Throughout 2020, we continued to see investors prefer the simpler trades in the market. One of the most popular examples of this is the success of Grayscale’s investment trust products. Given the lack of a regulated bitcoin exchange-traded fund, investors have sought high quality, single asset vehicles, specifically bitcoin-only ones, to express their investment thesis in digital assets. There are also strong incentives for investors to maintain simplicity and capture the beta first when entering an emerging market. [Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.]      8. As the bull returns, beta competes against venture for capital.      Investors who allocated to venture funds as of Jan. 1, 2020, expecting a 3.0x return multiple over eight to 10 years would have achieved 90% of their return target and remained liquid in just the first 11 months of 2020 if they allocated to BTC instead. An allocation to ETH would have performed even better (4.7x return).      9. Stablecoins have become the market’s unsung heroes.      The rise of stablecoins boosted liquidity in the crypto market and enabled digital asset trading to become cheaper, faster and stablecoin-denominated. In 2020, the market capitalization of stablecoins has nearly quintupled from just under $5 million in 2019 to nearly $27 billion at the time of writing.      10. From speculators to allocators: witnessing crypto’s investor maturation.      While the crypto industry has witnessed some occasional institutional moments since 2018, none quite resulted in direct price appreciation the way 2020’s institutional movement did. Tudor Investment Corporation, Rothschild Investment Corp., Fidelity, JPMorgan, Raoul Pal, Stanley Druckenmiller, Citibank, Guggenheim, Alliance Bernstein, BlackRock, Square and MicroStrategy, to name a few, have enhanced bitcoin’s social proof this year.    A 2021 look ahead    We believe we are in the early phases of a 12- to 24-month bull market cycle in digital assets as part of a multi-decade long investment opportunity. Crypto investing is increasingly moving from speculation to allocation as high-quality institutional capital leads the current cycle. In 2021, it will be even more important to have a dedicated and intentional strategy to express the digital asset investment thesis.      There are now many different ways to invest into the growing digital asset class, ranging from single or multi-asset passive beta strategies to differentiated venture fund and hedge fund strategies. We expand on each of these in more detail below.      See also: Pantera’s Paul Veradittakit’s 2021 Predictions    Beta    Passive strategies can be accessed via single asset vehicles (e.g. BTC only) or index funds for multi-asset exposure. Reported assets under management (AUM) in VisionTrack is now $13.6 billion for passive beta strategies and expected to grow significantly in 2021.      We believe bitcoin will continue to be the first stop for many allocators who are new to digital assets. It is reasonable to assume that in order to build conviction in this asset class, allocators need to get comfortable with the general notion of how a blockchain works, and why its value proposition is unique relative to everything else in their investable universe (that may also come with longer and more established track records of success). In 2021, investors are also likely to expand their definition of beta to include ether in addition to bitcoin.    Venture    Venture funds in crypto generally focus on equity only, tokens only or equity and tokens across various stages from a structural perspective. We estimate dedicated crypto venture fund AUM to be in excess of $10 billion.      We believe we will see continued growth of dedicated crypto venture fund strategies into 2021. In addition to Fund II’s and Fund III’s, 2021 more focus is likely to turn to thematic differentiation (e.g. DeFi vs. infrastructure), structural differentiation (equity vs. tokens), stage differentiation (pre-seed, Series A, growth stage), and geographic differentiation (U.S., Asia, emerging markets, etc.).    Hedge funds    At Vision Hill, we segment all crypto hedge funds into one of three strategy categories: fundamental, quantitative and opportunistic. There is currently $2.4 billion in dedicated crypto hedge fund AUM in VisionTrack.      We believe 2021 will be a breakout year for crypto hedge funds. With an expected bullish market regime, we expect distinctive (idiosyncratic) asset selection will present opportunities for differentiated and uncorrelated outperformance (alpha).    Preparing for 2021    Investors should create a dedicated, thoughtful and comprehensive investment process for digital asset portfolio construction as they would with any other investment vertical such as equities, credit or real estate. This begins with understanding the overall opportunity set, categorizing the different types of investments, their risk and return profiles, investment horizons and durations, and liquidity. The next step is gathering the best data possible to make more informed and smarter investment decisions. The future is bright for digital assets.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Dan Zuller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/01/stablecoins-unsung-heroes-and-other-institutional-crypto-takeaways,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ce1e29542eb682fd3de73fc1e7ca83f3b950ba92-1193x802.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385496,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB24H7,1609506004,Lessons in Failing to Apply Blockchain and AI to Combat COVID,"This year 2020 has seen quite a variety of exciting developments in the blockchain space. To name just a few: the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as major economic forces and sources of crypto network user tractions, the maturation of layer 2 Ethereum solutions and the rollout of a variety of new blockchain releases with favorable scalability properties.      While all this technical progress has been unfolding, the world at large has been reeling from a tiny virus that has turned into one of the largest social and economic disruptions of the modern era. As the year winds to a widely welcomed close, it’s worth asking what blockchain tech has contributed to humanity’s efforts to cope with the pandemic.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Ben Goertzel is founder and CEO of SingularityNET, a blockchain-based AI marketplace project.    The short answer is, in spite of some large gaps that blockchain is very well suited to fit and some fairly serious efforts, so far the contribution of blockchain to combating COVID-19 has been, honestly, fairly minimal. This may improve a bit in the next six months as we head into the tail end of the pandemic, but the situation is not likely to change incredibly radically.      What we can learn that might be helpful in enabling blockchain to play a more critical role in addressing the next global crisis, whatever it might be.    Centralized efforts at privacy-preserving contact tracing by Google and Apple haven’t fared much better.    The pandemic was a fantastic opportunity for blockchain technologies focused on personal medical data sovereignty. China and other Asian countries fought COVID-19 while setting privacy aside and aggressively leveraging tracking and tracing. Blockchain tech provides the option for privacy-preserving track and trace, and for broader privacy-preserving gathering and aggregation of personal data for collective analysis for the common medical good.      Several blockchain-based contract tracing apps emerged, e.g., from Nodle and Blockchain Baseline Protocol. There was also MIT Safepaths that used secure distributed computations and strong encryption throughout, though not blockchain per se. Adoption was minimal. To be fair, centralized efforts at privacy-preserving contact tracing by Google and Apple haven’t fared much better.      Then there were creative efforts like the Decentralized Pandemic Reserve DAO, aimed at allocating critical resources in difficult times, my own project SingularityNET’s Intelligent Agent-Based Simulation Modeling for scientifically evaluating and proposing pandemic management policies, and ImmunoLynk’s decentralized IPFS-based network for managing immunity testing results.      While scientifically and technically quite sound, these have not so far played a key role in society’s management of the pandemic.    Advanced thinking    My own team’s experience with COVID-19 agent-based modeling, for scientifically evaluating and proposing pandemic management policies, was instructive.      While building and experimenting with advanced computer science methods for simulating COVID-19 spread and estimating the impact of various policies, we’ve been living lives under the constraint of COVID policies derived in far less sophisticated and thorough ways.      See also: InterPlanetary File System Is Uncensorable During Coronavirus News Fog      Many times we have asked ourselves: Why is our society, so technologically advanced in so many ways, unwilling to leverage the best available modeling technology to scientifically determine the best policies for saving lives and maintaining economic health?      In the next months, we may well find some forward-thinking jurisdictions interested to use our AI modeling methods to understand the best way to manage COVID-19 during the phase of initial vaccine rollout. But while this does have potential to save lives and economies, what should have happened was the application of these sorts of tools on the national and global scale right from the start.      Lest you think the issue here is some special shortcoming of blockchain technology, though, it’s worth noting the same basic situation has occurred as regards application of AI to help with COVID-19.      There have been some interesting successes – the COVID-19 Chest CT Pneumonia Scanner, an infrared scanner for body temperature, Nference’s study of COVID-19 literature and clinical data. But AI, like blockchain, has been on the margins rather than at the core of society’s COVID-19 response.      We have had some interesting successes applying neural-symbolic machine learning and reasoning technology to personalized medicine in the cancer domain – predicting which cancer medicines will work for which patients based on their genomic and clinical characteristics.      Early on in the pandemic we found some wonderfully forward-thinking physicians, Ray & Roger Ng, founders of the Care Protocol. They were interested in collaborating to use similar techniques to predict what combination of COVID-19 anti-virals should be used for which patients. Should work great – except that Food and Drug Administration approval for the clinical trial in the U.S. is still pending. It’s great that approvals for COVID-19 vaccines have been accelerated but unfortunate that the same special treatment has not been extended to AI-driven therapeutics, like the one SingularityNET has been involved with.      See also: Ben Goertzel – Decentralized Tech Will Be Ready for Humanity’s Next Crisis      To those of us in the middle of the blockchain/AI space, it’s obvious the radical power these technologies could have helped with a pandemic. Compared with problems like converting the global financial ecosystem to DeFi or creating decentralized beneficial AGI, helping palliate a pandemic doesn’t even stress our available software and algorithms that extremely. But what our tools can do doesn’t matter that much if, when push comes to shove, neither the general public nor the major societal decision-makers can understand and see the value.      In the end, the failure of blockchain and AI tools to contribute in a massive and central way to combat the pandemic is attributable to the same factors that are slowing their adoption overall: making the broad value and importance of our tech clear outside our own special communities. If our experience seeking to apply our advanced tech to help with COVID-19 serves as a wake-up call in this regard, it will have been well worth the effort.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | AGX,Ben Goertzel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/01/lessons-in-failing-to-apply-blockchain-and-ai-to-combat-covid,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d3976fa3e8bc6597f54302f85ec44de5fe5deb0-1200x710.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
