The Palestinian Monetary Authority’s push to develop a digital currency is likely impacted by Palestine’s dire economic situation.

42406720,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf83ti,1624567535,What Crypto Firms Can Expect From Friday’s FATF Plenary Meeting,"There’s a lot at stake this week as crypto comes further within the creep of global regulations.      The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental anti-money laundering (AML) body, wraps its second annual review of progress made by member countries to implement a cryptocurrency compliance framework.      It’s been over two years since the FATF recommended bringing cryptocurrency firms (virtual asset service providers, or VASPs, in FATF parlance) within its regulatory framework. This has created challenges for the industry and regulators alike, particularly around areas like the ""Travel Rule,"" where third-party VASPs must exchange personally identifiable information (PII) about customers along with transactions.      To further complicate matters, the FATF’s proposed regulations have been forced to expand in step with crypto innovation to accommodate rapidly evolving areas like decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins.    Read more: State of Crypto: FATF’s New Guidance Takes Aim at DeFi    Since the last plenary meeting in March 2021, when FATF issued draft guidance, there has been an overwhelming response from the industry. In short, many in the space are worried regulators will take too broad an approach, particularly when it comes to things like DeFi.      Indeed, there has been such an enthusiastic response from the industry that some are predicting the FATF will likely kick the can down the road to its next plenary meeting in four months’ time, regulatory insiders told CoinDesk.      “There probably wasn't sufficient time given the volume of response to process and deliberate on them, given that consultation closed in the latter part of April,” Siân Jones, senior partner at XReg Consulting, said in an interview, adding:    “I think there’s probably a 50-50 chance that they would not go ahead with adopting the guidance at this plenary but might choose to defer until the next plenary.”  Unintended consequences    This view was echoed by Malcolm Wright, head of the AML Working Group of crypto trade body Global Digital Finance.      “I've heard similarly, that I don't think we're going to see the revised guidance on June 30 or whenever they say the plenary is finished. I have a feeling it will be later. And that they are taking into consideration what the industry has raised to view that properly,” Wright told CoinDesk.      The response to the draft guidance submitted by Global Digital Finance focused on the “unintended consequences” of the FATF wording.      “The unintended consequences of trying to catch everything in DeFi means that there may be people caught by regulation where it makes no sense to regulate them,” said Wright, whose day job is head of compliance at 100x Group, the owner of BitMEX. “Some of the wording was so broad, you could argue that even far-reaching service providers would be caught by it.”    Malta gets gray-listed    A FATF-related headline grabber this week concerned Malta, which is being added to the AML watchdog’s gray list, essentially classing the jurisdiction as high-risk because of AML failings.      Malta is a popular hub with crypto exchanges and service providers, with Binance at one point saying it had chosen the island for its headquarters. There is no connection as yet between the FATF gray-listing of Malta and crypto. Binance was bounced from Malta in 2020.    Read more: Binance Is Not Under Our Jurisdiction, Says Malta Regulator    “It’s not surprising given the amount of focus there has been on money laundering issues in Malta from the [European Union] and elsewhere,” said Jones. “I wouldn't necessarily think that crypto is front and center, but it will unfortunately class Malta as riskier and require more due diligence.”      Wright pointed out that Malta was one of the first countries to provide a regulatory regime for cryptocurrency.      “It’s a sensible framework, and actually some of the controls around it are very robust,” said Wright. “Unless the FATF says it’s something specific to crypto, we have to assume this is about a broader risk-based approach.”",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | ZRX | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/24/what-crypto-firms-can-expect-from-fridays-fatf-plenary-meeting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6e0270acf388a0eddcc2705210ec0112eafb06d-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bearish sentiment is starting to wane as buyers fuel a relief rally from Tuesday’s shakeout low of around $29,000. The cryptocurrency is up about 4% over the past 24 hours, but is still down about 8% over the past seven days.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $34949, +6.51%  Ether (ETH) $2,016, +5.48%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4266.39, +0.58%  Gold: $1773.4, -0.31%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.492%, compared with 1.489% on Wednesday  Bitcoin options expiry    As June comes to a close, roughly 69,000 bitcoin is set to expire at a notional value of $2.37 billion, according to data source Genesis Volatility.      “Max pain levels are good to keep an eye on going into an options expiration like this,” wrote Greg Magadini, CEO of Genesis Volatility, in an email to CoinDesk. The max pain level for bitcoin implies a rally up to about $40,000, which is also the strike price with the most open interest.      At the current price, this will be the second smallest month-end options expiry of the year, compared to a notional value of about $6 billion in March.      This month’s options expiry will occur with lower volume and a tight trading range this month, suggesting weak demand from buyers.    Ether loses ground to bitcoin    Ether’s market-capitalization relative to bitcoin is below 40%, according to Skew. A similar situation occurred in 2018, which preceded a period of underperformance in ETH vs. BTC.      The chart below shows ETH/BTC declining from resistance over the past month. There is short-term support at the 100-day moving average, although technicals suggest the ratio could see further downside.    Crypto goes mainstream    Cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly mainstream, with Citigroup being the latest megabank to roll out crypto services to at least some of its customers.      Citigroup’s wealth management division has formed a new unit called Digital Assets Group, which will be helmed by Alex Kriete and Greg Girasole of the bank’s Citi Global Wealth Investments (CGWI) arm. The unit will be “focusing on all aspects of this fast-growing space of blockchain enabled finance,” according to the bank.      Meanwhile, U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is entering the Japanese market. The Nasdaq-listed exchange’s subsidiary registered with the Financial Services Agency (FSA), the country’s financial watchdog, on June 18.    Altcoin roundup  While bitcoin and most alternative cryptocurrencies are slowly recovering from the latest market sell-off, the price of the coin internet computer (ICP), which was once the star of the space, sank from $630 to $34 in less than two months. “With prices retreating across the industry, the most recently hyped projects have been among those hardest hit,” said Rick Delaney, senior analyst at OKEx Insights. “In ICP’s case, it seems the harder and faster it pumps, the more severe the dump.”  Two of South Korea’s four largest exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb, have been delisting altcoins as they prepare for an upcoming regulatory overhaul. Delisting announcements have caused prices for many altcoins to plummet by 50% or more, causing considerable losses among retail investors.

42406708,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf83lq,1624564931,'Bitcoin Is the Revolution': An Interview With Alex Gladstein,"Alex Gladstein is chief strategy officer at the Human Rights Foundation, vice president of strategy for the Oslo Freedom Forum and the preeminent advocate for Bitcoin as a tool for human rights activists around the world to fight back against censorship and government oppression. We talked over the phone just before he was appearing at a semi-exclusive Cafe Bitcoin Clubhouse with Lightning Labs founder Elizabeth Stark and uber-podcaster Peter McCormack about bringing bitcoin to billions of people worldwide (that is, not just the billionaires).      Gladstein, who began at HRF in 2007, has described Bitcoin as an “escape hatch from tyranny” and a “Trojan Horse for freedom.” In a recent contribution to Bitcoin Magazine, “Check Your Financial Privilege,” he lambasted the arrogance of wealthy bitcoin critics who live in liberal democracies and take the stability of reserve currency status for granted.      He introduces readers to a Nigerian entrepreneur, a Sudanese doctor and an Ethiopian businessman, whose stories illuminate the revolutionary impact that a permissionless, borderless, non-discriminatory monetary system could have on the billions who cannot open a savings account, send money abroad or receive payment over the internet.      The HRF, which began accepting bitcoin donations in 2014, has long recognized the digital currency’s potential as a force for individual liberty. In June 2020, it launched the Bitcoin Development Fund to support software developers working to strengthen the Bitcoin network so that it can serve as a financial tool for human rights activists, civil society organizations and journalists around the world. Grants have been awarded to developers and privacy-focused projects, including CoinSwap, JoinInbox, Zeus and Fully Noded.    Read more: Human Rights Foundation Gives Out $210K in Bitcoin Development Grants    In 2009, Gladstein helped launch the Oslo Freedom Forum, HRF’s series of conferences under the slogan “Challenging Power.” HRF began holding bitcoin-human rights workshops in 2017, connecting global activists with philanthropists, policymakers, artists and innovators. Gladstein guides the organization's growth, fundraising and media, focusing on advocacy for the Bitcoin network.      The following has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.      CoinDesk: How do you define “human rights,” and how does Bitcoin fit into that definition?      Alex Gladstein: There are two types of human rights: negative rights (liberties) and positive rights (entitlements). The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights is split, because the document was a negotiation between the Americans, who wanted liberties, and the Soviets, who wanted entitlements. The first half kind of reads like the United States’ Bill of Rights – it includes the freedom of speech and thought, private property and freedom to participate in your government. The second half includes the right to shelter, education and healthcare.      HRF focuses on negative rights, because we believe they’re the foundation for an open society that works for everybody. If a dictatorship claims to just focus on the entitlements – it’s taking a shortcut and it’s all just a house of cards. Without a free press and other basic liberties, you can’t have a vibrant, growing, healthy society.      Bitcoin underscores free speech and property rights, and it checks authoritarianism. It’s a monetary system that governments cannot manipulate. If the government has total control over the economy, it’s game over.    Read more: The Node: Bitcoin, Warts and All (A Reply to Alex Gladstein)    What are your top priorities now at the HRF and Oslo Freedom Forum?      Bitcoin is a voluntary phenomenon, but if activists want to use it, HRF wants to help them by providing education, resources and advice. We focus on supporting the improvement of the Bitcoin protocol and the apps, because the technology needs to become more usable. HRF supports the research of the Open Money Initiative, and last year, we launched a fund that gives money away to developers that are helping the Bitcoin network become more secure, resilient and offer better privacy for users.      How do activists around the world use Bitcoin to advance their causes?      Activists in many countries have major problems with money – either they live under double or triple-digit inflation, or governments are easily able to surveil and shutter their bank accounts. Bitcoin can play a huge role here because it cannot be censored or stopped.    Bitcoin can play a huge role here because it cannot be censored or stopped.    Last October, there were protests against SARS across Nigeria. The Feminist Coalition had to begin accepting money through Bitcoin because all of their bank accounts were frozen. In Belarus, the opposition movement is using bitcoin to support pro-democracy activists because it's the safest way for them to receive money. In Russia, many journalists and media outlets covering Alexei Navalny have had their accounts frozen and are now using bitcoin. These are just a few examples.      What do you want newcomers to the Bitcoin community to know?      Bitcoin can help everybody. I focus on helping people living under authoritarian regimes, but there’s monetary repression happening everywhere. Don’t forget that there are millions of people in America who are underbanked or who are financially discriminated against.      There’s a lot of scams out there, and it’s hard for people to differentiate between bitcoin and thousands of other cryptocurrencies. I would encourage newcomers to spend a few months developing a solid understanding of why Bitcoin is different – why Bitcoin is the revolution. It’s a money system that is beyond the control of any one group of people, and we’ve never had anything like that before.    Read more: New to Bitcoin? Stay Safe and Avoid These Common Scams    How can the Bitcoin community best support the work of the Human Rights Foundation?      Bitcoin is a global, open-source money project that is an alternative – or the only option – for so many people. The best way to support HRF’s work is to give back to Bitcoin developers who are improving the network and making Bitcoin more decentralized and resilient. You can donate through OpenSats, Brink or HRF’s Bitcoin Development Fund. A lot of developers have a GitHub page where you can donate to them directly.

42406736,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf83uh,1624563526,Custodian Prime Trust Cuts Ties With Crypto Lender Celsius,"Custodian Prime Trust has given cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network 30 days to get off its platform, citing “red flags,” people familiar with the matter said.      Prime Trust confirmed it has terminated the contract with Celsius and after the notice period will turn off API (application interface programming) access to its custodial platform, but would not specify the reason.      “We've terminated our partnership with Celsius Network for a variety of business factors. The relationship lasted just over 12 months. We won’t comment beyond that other than to wish Celsius well in its endeavors,” Prime Trust said in a statement.      Celsius operates similarly to a bank in that it takes deposits of cryptocurrencies from one set of customers and lends crypto and dollars to another. The borrowers pledge other crypto assets as collateral. Since March 2020, the lender has been using Nevada-based Prime Trust to store assets for some of its customers.      A person familiar with the situation, who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Prime Trust’s risk team was concerned about Celsius’ strategy of “endlessly re-hypothecating assets.”      Rehypothecation is a practice whereby banks and brokers use, for their own purposes, assets that have been posted as collateral by their clients. The re-use of collateral from one lending transaction to finance additional loans creates a somewhat obscure and potentially dangerous type of financial derivative if abused.      It’s not the first time such allegations have been made about Celsius’ practices.    Read more: What Crypto Lender Celsius Isn’t Telling Its Depositors  Celsius responds    A Celsius spokesperson strenuously denied the re-hypothecation claims.      “Since Celsius started offering its services to NY residents, it has never rehypothecated their crypto assets,” the spokesperson said via email. “Unfortunately, the level of service provided to our NY users through our partnership with Prime Trust was not at the level Celsius users are accustomed to, and therefore we are planning to proceed with an alternative solution for our New York state users.”      In its terms of service, Celsius states that it “may lend, sell, pledge, hypothecate, assign, invest, use, commingle or otherwise dispose of assets and Eligible Digital Assets to counterparties or hold the Eligible Digital Assets with counterparties, and we will use our best commercial and operational efforts to prevent losses.”      The terms of service also indicate Prime Trust holds assets for Celsius customers in Texas and Washington state, not just New York. The Celsius spokesperson did not respond to requests for clarification.    Still using Fireblocks    Celsius’ other “core” custody provider is Fireblocks, the lender said when it announced the Prime Trust partnership last year.    The lender has used Fireblocks’ services since 2019, according to an October 2020 case studyhttps://www.fireblocks.com/resources/celsius/ on the custodian’s website.    “Both Prime Trust and Celsius are Fireblocks customers,” Fireblocks’ CEO Michael Shaulov said through a spokesperson Thursday. “As a non-custodial technology provider, we don’t dictate or intervene in our customers’ businesses.”      Separately, Celsius announced Wednesday it was moving its operations out of the U.K., citing regulatory uncertainty, and is looking to move to the U.S.      Marc Hochstein contributed reporting.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/24/custodian-prime-trust-cuts-ties-with-crypto-lender-celsius,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c2a6e31d15e7d5ab39ec1c4e89b6d967d71d4ed-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Internet computer's (ICP) price was changing hands at $34.63, down 0.44% in the 24 hours leading up to press time, according to Messari. The token's value, according to TradingView, was once as high as around $630 when the ICP/USD pair went live on the U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase Pro on May 10.      By comparison, bitcoin, the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up 4.71% in the past 24 hours and trading at $34,939.80, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Most crypto assets on CoinDesk 20 were higher at the time of writing.      From the start ICP's price had a wild run when several exchanges listed it including Coinbase, Binance, Huobi and OKEx. In just one day, May 10, the price went from $630 to as low as $250 before slowly coming back to around $400. The decline to the current $34.63 has continued since then.      Why?      ""The fact that the token was launched during such a boisterous [market] likely pushed initial valuation into upper range of expectations,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, told CoinDesk.

The virus, which has been circulating since at least June 2018, installs crypto-mining software that has yielded its authors over $2 million worth of monero.      Monero is a privacy coin that is often used by cybercriminals because it is much more difficult to trace than other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Monero-focused crypto-mining attacks are relatively common: The Pirate Bay, a website where users can download movies, music, software and games, announced in 2018 it would be “cryptojacking” visitors’ processing power to mine for monero, and in 2020, a botnet called “Vollgar” was found to be targeting Microsoft’s SQL servers to mine for monero, as well.      According to Avast’s analysis, Crackonosh successfully operated for years because it had built-in mechanisms to disable security software and updates, which made it difficult for users to detect and remove the program.      The malware is thought to have originated in the Czech Republic, but it has a global reach. Cases in the United States make up only 5% of the total.      Avast’s blog post addresses the spread of the malware and teaches affected users how to uninstall the program.

42406724,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf83xe,1624556363,Protecting Free Speech With Decentralized Tech,"In 2017, a 14-year old student athlete posted vulgar language to Snapchat. “F**k school f**k softball f**k cheer f**k everything,” Brandi Levy posted to her 250 followers, along with a video where she and her friend extended their middle fingers, all because she failed to make the varsity team.      The snap disappeared in 24 hours but a screenshot was sent to the school’s cheerleading coach. Levy was suspended from the junior-varsity team for the school year, kick-starting a legal battle between the school board and Levy, which wound its way up to America’s highest court, over the right to student expression.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    The U.S. Supreme Court ruled yesterday to protect student speech on social media. In an 8-1 decision, it was decided the Pennsylvania school had overstepped its bounds and violated Levy’s First Amendment right. This ruling upholds a longstanding tradition of protecting controversial speech even on campus – even if it’s vulgar, falls against school rules or is unsportsmanlike, as the school argued – so long as it is not genuinely disruptive.      The case is significant as more and more of our communication takes place online, forcing courts, schools and workplaces to grapple with the ramifications. Speech is no longer localized; it can go viral the world over. It’s no longer ephemeral (even on Snapchat) when it can be easily recorded and shared. So should speech still have the same protections?      The court, thankfully, argued yes. But it’s a worrisome matter of fact that it could have gone the other way, and further, that not every country has such a robust tradition of protecting speech as the U.S. Worse, as some may argue, schools may not be able to regulate student speech (with notable exceptions) but the private platforms where it occurs certainly can.      As CoinDesk columnist and venture capitalist Nic Carter noted in an essay this summer, the distinction between public and private authorities has been eroded. While there may be laws on the books protecting free expression, in practice speech is often curtailed or silenced online. In a separate piece, Carter argued for a “user-owned and operated social internet built on a public key infrastructure,” which he sees as the only way to “resist tyrants both in the public and the private sector.”      In just one recent example, The Block's Wolfie Zhao wrote today about how anonymous protestors in Hong Kong are preserving the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily using Arweave, after the tabloid was forced shut down amid a national security probe.    Read more: Justin Wales – Why Bitcoin Is Protected by the First Amendment    The rise of the metaverse, the extension of ownership rights over digital money and the attempt to create “censorship-resistant” technologies all speak to the shrinking divide between on- and offline realities. Crypto’s great aim could be described as trying to make the elastic, frictionless world of the web a little more life-like.      In his brief for the court, Justice Stephen Breyer quoted a well-known aphorism: “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” (He noted the quote is often attributed to Voltaire, but was likely coined by Evelyn Beatrice Hall.) It’s good that there are public institutions willing to defend basic civil liberties.

These guidelines included instructions to submit operation plans that detail protocols for evaluating and listing tokens as well as identifying and dealing with scams, fraud and illegal trades.      Read more: South Korean Banks to ‘Review’ Partnerships With Crypto Exchanges      All crypto exchanges are required to register with the FIU by Sept. 24, but the FIU has the authority to reject applications by exchanges that fail to meet certain conditions or are perceived as too risky (in terms of potential money laundering or fraud). Exchanges seem to have interpreted the FIU’s “guidelines” as a set of de facto orders, which could explain the mass delisting throughout this past month. Given the current trend, delistings are likely to continue up until Sept. 24.      In addition to the FIU, exchanges also have to worry about their partnerships with domestic commercial banks. Exchanges must secure a bank partnership in order to qualify for FIU registration, and banks have the authority to choose which exchanges they’ll work with. The Big 4 currently have bank partnerships but these are currently under review as banks deliberate whether they’ll extend their contracts with crypto exchanges beyond Sept. 24.    Lots of listings    As of June 21, Upbit had 178 tokens available for trading. Bithumb had 178 and Coinone had 180. This is up to six times the number of tokens listed by smaller competitors. Korbit has fewer than 40.      By comparison, Coinbase currently supports fewer than 100 tokens.      Until now, exchanges have had a big incentive to list as many tokens as possible: transaction fees. The more coins traded, the higher the trading volume; the higher the trading volume, the more transaction fees earned. Because there’s no legal procedure for listing coins, exchanges have been able to list as many as they want.      The FSC estimates the Big 4 registered an average daily trading volume of 22 trillion won (US$19.4 billion) during April 2021.      Koreans also tend to trade altcoins a lot more than some of their overseas counterparts. Last month CoinMarketCap estimated that bitcoin accounts for around 40% of transactions globally but only 7% of transactions among Korean traders.      A former employee at a crypto exchange (who asked to remain anonymous) told CoinDesk Korea that “over 90% of Korea’s crypto trade volume is in altcoins,” which “gives domestic exchanges an incentive to list as many as possible.”      Read more: South Korea Seizes $47M Worth of Crypto for Back Taxes: Report      Bithumb has listed 52 coins within 2021; Coinone listed 39. That means that for Bithumb to list 50 tokens in around 200 days, it would have had to list one every four days. That doesn’t provide much time to review each project.      Noh Woong-rae, a lawmaker with South Korea's Democratic Party, has criticized exchanges for this kind of “indiscriminate token listing.”      “They listed a massive amount of questionable tokens only to suddenly delist them without providing any clear explanation, leaving investors in the dust,” Noh said.      “If authorities discover any evidence that exchanges listed shady tokens despite knowing they would likely be delisted later on to gain a short-term profit, I think that’s grounds for rejecting their FIU registration,” Noh added.      Delisting announcements have caused prices for many altcoins to plummet by 50% or more, causing considerable losses among retail investors.      So far, Upbit has delisted 36 tokens in 2021. Bithumb has delisted 10. Coinone and Korbit have respectively delisted three each.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Felix Im,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/24/upbit-bithumb-delist-numerous-coins-ahead-of-south-korean-regulatory-review,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b31e4bf780b0b1999ad680998dd5fce892e2cc8-1500x997.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406719,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf83sj,1624543200,DeFi Insurance Upstart Risk Harbor Goes Live With $3.25M in Seed Funding,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) insurance platform Risk Harbor is emerging from stealth, armed with a $3.25 million seed round co-led by Framework Ventures and Pantera Capital.      Also included in the round were Bain Capital Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Nima Capital and Digital Currency Group (parent company of CoinDesk).      Insurance is thin on the ground in crypto, even among large, well-established exchanges and custodians. In the experimental DeFi arena, where bugs and hacks are relatively frequent, cover is limited to a handful of insurance alternatives such as Nexus Mutual.      Risk Harbor replaces the decentralized governance process invoked when deciding to pay out on claims, opting instead for a pre-programmed set of criteria which, when met, trigger an automated payout, sometimes called “parametric insurance.”      “When a governance process decides whether a claim is legitimate or not, they tend to lean towards the claim not being legitimate because they don’t want to pay their money,” Risk Harbor co-founder Drew Patel said in an interview. “Why can’t we have the rules on-chain, stating that if certain events occur, there’s a payout?”      It’s the latest in a nascent crop of experiments around DeFi-inspired insurance projects.    Read more: DeFi and Staking Insurance Startup Unslashed Raises $2M    Risk Harbor operates as a two-sided marketplace in which DeFi depositors are able to purchase protection for their capital in DeFi projects, while others are able to underwrite that protection in return for premiums. Previously in private beta, the platform currently has $2 million in liquidity locked in its claims pool.      “On one side of the marketplace are protection buyers, and on the other are underwriters that are basically saying, ‘Hey, I’m willing to bet that this event doesn’t occur’,” said Patel, adding:    “Underwriters choose from a range of protocols and will have to pay out if a legitimate claim happens. But they don't decide whether the claim is legitimate or not, the smart contracts do.”    The seed funding will be used to scale the platform and to revamp the user interface. The underwriters looking to profit from risks associated with these platforms will typically be DeFi pros and DeFi whales, according to Patel.      Risk Harbor has also attracted a sizable roster of angel investors, including Anthony Pompliano of Pomp Investments, Noah Jessop of Proof Group, Ashleigh Schap of Uniswap, Nikil Viswanathan and Joe Lau of Alchemy, Do Kwon of Terra Money, Seb Audet of Zapper, Tyler Ward of BarnBridge and former Polygon engineer Ashish Rajpurohit.      “What makes Risk Harbor exciting is not only the fact that it offers protection for DeFi protocols without requiring an oracle, but that it also should be more capital efficient than any other model due to its Berkshire-like structure that enables cover providers to earn a yield on top of their premiums,” Pantera Capital’s Joey Krug said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MATIC | UNI,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/06/24/defi-insurance-upstart-risk-harbor-goes-live-with-325m-in-seed-funding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ebd7d4a29bfdf5ac9b71712cf371093e51f3547c-1500x1166.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm announced Thursday that the Series E round of funding was led by Coatue Management and brings it valuation to $4.2 billion. Chainalysis also raised $100 million in a Series D funding round that was announced in March.      March's round, led by Fred Ehrsam's Paradigm, valued the blockchain tracking firm at $2 billion.      The Chainalysis' new funding round is the latest in a trio of funding announcements in what's suddenly a high-profile corner of the crypto world.      Firms like Chainalysis, CipherTrace, Elliptic, TRM Labs and Blocktrace help banks and law enforcement track illicit funds moving across public blockchains. Thanks to this so-called blockchain analysis, U.S. authorities were able to seize much of the bitcoin paid by Colonial Pipeline as ransom to the DarkSide hacking group.      Such headlines have been a boon for recent fundraising efforts.      CipherTrace raised $27 million, CoinDesk reported Tuesday, and TRM Labs brought in $14 million last week.      Chainalysis may be the leader of the pack in terms of stature, and certainly it is in terms of capital raised: The firm said the latest round brings its total funding to $365 million.

As part of revamping of its private key infrastructure in response to the incident, Roll is integrating with crypto custody firm Fireblocks to secure the platform.      Roll co-founder Sid Kalla said in an email that Fireblocks’ multiparty computation (MPC) wallet infrastructure will let Roll securely sign transactions without storing the private keys in a single place.      “This greatly improves our operational security as we move forward,” he said, adding:    “It also helps prevent private key theft and compromised credentials. We will also have cybersecurity insurance of up to $30 million for Roll creators and users via Fireblocks. This appears to be a first in crypto-creator insurance, especially in a creator’s own token.”    MPC allows for large pools of data to stay encrypted while permitting information to be extracted from those data pools using encrypted computations. Fireblocks emphasizes its ability to handle a high level of transactions on Ethereum with low fees.      Fireblocks's wallet infrastructure already supports large retail-facing platforms, such as Celsius, Revolut, BlockFi and Salt Lending. The company closed a $133 million funding round in March, four days after Roll’s security incident, and has handled over half a trillion dollars in assets.    Read more: Social Tokens Crash After Reported Hack at Roll    Roll CEO and co-founder Bradley Miles said Roll is working hard to revamp its security infrastructure. He also said Roll is releasing a new version of Roll smart contracts that are currently under audit from two separate firms.      “The vision of these new contracts is to blend DeFi [decentralized finance] and the creator economy through social money,” he said. “We feel what we call the ‘DeFi Creator Economy’ can eventually eclipse the traditional creator economy in market size.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/24/roll-repairing-from-hack-enlists-fireblocks-for-key-protection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ab20bf3a840eae37c893b4b956ca6d3b7b4e366d-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Nevada-based Huobi Trust Co., a subsidiary of Huobi Tech, will go live by the end of July. Huobi Tech is a Hong Kong-based public company acquired by Huobi founder Leon Lin through a reverse takeover in 2018.      The latest move comes six months after Huobi Trust won a trust license from the Nevada Financial Institutions Division, according to a filing by Huobi Tech with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in December.      The new trust company will provide custodial and compliance services for crypto firms that have businesses in the U.S. market.      Stable Universal, a U.S.-based stablecoin issuer, teamed up with Paxos to launch HUSD on the Huobi Global trading platform in July 2019.

The company claimed HUSD surpassed $1 billion in market value on May 20 and has increased by 560% since January. The stablecoin is supported by decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms such as Uniswap, Curve.fi, Cream protocol and the Heco blockchain.    The comeback    Huobi Trust is part of the exchange’s efforts to expand in the U.S. after HBUS, another legal entity affiliated with Huobi Group, ceased operations in December 2019 because of regulatory concerns.      The exchange, which is based in the African island nation of Seychelles, has since been evaluating different ways to reenter the U.S. market, including working with a licensed U.S.-based brokerage firm. The parent group said at the time that upon returning it would make its businesses in the country more compliant with regulations.

42387147,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBlkTz,1624536094,Article 7 and Bitcoin’s Latin American Coup,"When I first heard that El Salvador had passed its Bitcoin Law on June 9, I was astonished. It never occurred to me that any national government would embrace bitcoin and make it an official medium of exchange. As a longtime advocate of what F.A. Hayek, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, called “choice in currency,” I welcomed any nation’s attempt to let bitcoin compete on a level playing field with its existing, official money.      But when I turned to the two-page long statute itself, my excitement turned to dismay. Though parts of it do indeed put bitcoin on an equal footing with the U.S. dollar, El Salvador’s official currency since 2001, the law’s seventh article says, “Every economic agent must accept bitcoin as payment when offered to him by whoever acquires a good or service.” In other words, bitcoin is to be not just a legal tender in El Salvador but a compulsory one.    George Selgin is the director of the Cato Institute’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives.  Compulsory choice?    Forcing businesses to accept some particular money is both unusual and utterly at odds with the Hayekian philosophy that led to bitcoin’s development and caused so many libertarians to embrace it. “Why,” Hayek asked,    should we not let people use freely what money they want to use? ... I have no objection to governments issuing money, but I believe their claim to a monopoly, or their power to limit the kinds of money in which contracts may be concluded within their territory … to be wholly harmful.    Alas, “to limit the kinds of money in which contracts may be concluded within their territory” is just what El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law proposes.    Read more: Nic Carter – El Salvador Doesn’t Need a Bitcoin Mandate  Confusion about 'legal tender'    Despite what many people think, deeming some kinds of money “legal tender” typically means nothing more than, so far as the courts are concerned, a debtor can use, say, U. S. legal tender to pay off an outstanding U.S. dollar debt, even if a creditor would rather have the debt paid some other way. Although he wasn’t keen on such laws, Hayek understood they were both common and, with notable exceptions, not especially burdensome.      Compulsory or “forced” tender laws, like Article 7, obliging everyone to accept certain types of money for any payment whatsoever, are another kettle of fish. Historically, such laws have almost always been resorted to by oppressive, revenue-hungry governments, which sometimes want to make their violation a capital crime. According to Dror Goldberg, an expert on the history of legal tender laws, forced tender legislation:    strikes at the very heart of the freedom of exchange and contract. As its practical implication has typically been to force producers to part with all their produce for paper, it can also be a severe violation of property rights. It is a rule that penalizes passive behavior. It is, or should be, a controversial rule, unlike a rule prohibiting counterfeiting of money.    Most countries today don’t have forced tender laws. It’s perfectly legal, for example, for a U.S. merchant to refuse legal tender. Every “credit only” business does so (only some coins and Federal Reserve notes are legal tender). A business can even insist on payment in bitcoin. In El Salvador, likewise, it’s already legal for a business to accept bitcoin only: though it is (and will remain) legal tender for paying dollar debts, the U.S. dollar has never been a forced tender. Article 7 is sui generis.    Victimless coercion?    Article 7’s apologists insist it really doesn’t involve any coercion. They note, first of all, the Bitcoin Law’s Article 12 exempts “those who, by evident and notorious fact, do not have access to the technologies that allow them to carry out transactions in bitcoin” from it. But most Salvadorans have smartphones, and the only other “technologies” needed are internet access and an app or two, which the government plans to supply to those presently lacking them.    Read more: Frances Coppola: Why Bitcoin Could Be Good for El Salvador    The government also plans to make it possible for anyone paid in bitcoin to have them instantly converted into digital U.S. dollars, and to bear any exchange risk involved, using a $150 million “trust fund” to be administered by government-run exchange or “Casa de Cambio” set up at Bancasel, El Salvador’s government-owned development bank. In effect, the Casa de Cambio will serve as one big stockjobber, taking the opposite side of Salvadoran’s bitcoin bets – a risky business because a bullish bitcoin market may see relatively few bitcoin conversions whereas a bearish one, like this week’s, could see many more. And though it will nominally be borne by the government, that risk will really be born by Salvadoran taxpayers who must foot the bill both for the initial fund and for any losses it incurs.    Bitcoin’s limited appeal    Instead of insisting that Salvadorans shouldn’t mind Article 7, the Bitcoin Law’s defenders should be asking whether they do mind it. The response to the law so far leaves little doubt. Complaints have already forced El Salvador President Nayib Bukele to back away from his plan to have the government pay its own workers in bitcoin.      The response to a recent survey taken by El Salvador’s Chamber of Commerce shows, furthermore, that over 92% of all those surveyed, and 94% of participating entrepreneurs, would rather nor have to accept it. Most also said that they’d rather not take remittances in it, and that they planned to convert whatever bitcoin they received into dollars. Encouraged by such sentiments, a deputy of El Salvador’s leading opposition party has already filed a suit challenging the Bitcoin Law’s constitutionality.    Read more: JP Koning – El Salvador Adopts Bitcoin: Hype or History in the Making?    But perhaps the best evidence of bitcoins’ limited appeal is none other than Article 7 itself. After all, were bitcoin truly the “perfect” exchange medium Bukele claimed it to be in a recent interview, and Salvadorans could only gain by switching to it, Article 7 simply wouldn’t be necessary. Making bitcoin acceptance costless, supplying the necessary infrastructure, technology and training, and simply allowing Salvadorans to use it without penalizing them, through capital gains taxes or otherwise, for doing so ought to suffice to eventually ""bitcoinize"" El Salvador.      So long as it stays on the books, Article 7 should remind us, and the people of El Salvador, that President Bukele isn’t quite convinced by his own rhetoric.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,George Selgin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/24/article-7-and-bitcoins-latin-american-coup,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f79cd8577480a9612919737edc8ae0804b0c9cd4-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387153,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBlkcn,1624530240,"Grayscale 'Unlockings' Poses Downside Risk to Bitcoin Price, JPMorgan Says","While some observers say the bitcoin price has bottomed out, analysts at JPMorgan remain bearish, identifying the impending unlocking of shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) purchased in January as a source of downside risk to the cryptocurrency.      ""Despite some improvement, our signals remain overall bearish,"" JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note Wednesday. ""Selling of GBTC shares exiting the six-month lockup period during June and July has emerged as an additional headwind for bitcoin.""      Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world's largest digital-assets fund manager, allows institutional investors to gain exposure to bitcoin through shares in the trust, which currently holds 654,600 BTC. That's more than 3% of the cryptocurrency's supply. Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.      Accredited investors can buy GBTC shares directly at the net asset value (NAV) in daily private placements by depositing bitcoin or U.S. dollars. The shares can be sold in the secondary market only after a six-month lock-in period.      The trust's popularity exploded at the end of the last year when the premium on GBTC shares rose to a record-high 40% on Dec. 17. As such, investors rushed to carry trade or buy shares at NAV in a bid to sell them at a premium six months later. According to JPMorgan, the trust saw record inflows of $2 billion in December, followed by $1.7 billion in January.      The January tranche is scheduled for unlocking next month and is likely to release 140,000 bitcoin worth of shares, CoinShares' chief strategy officer, Meltem Demirors, pointed out on Twitter.      After unlocking, investors have the option of liquidating their shareholdings in the secondary market. Analysts at JPMorgan foresee investors selling at least some of their shares, leading to ""downward pressure on GBTC prices and on bitcoin markets more generally.""      What's not clear is whether investors will reinvest proceeds back into Grayscale by rebuying bitcoin and transferring it over to the trust. If that happens, bitcoin will likely pick up a strong bid.      Until February, the shares consistently traded at a premium. That kept overall demand strong, with investors rotating money back into the trust after unlockings. ""Most of the capital was likely from investors doing a ""rinse-in repeat,"" Ben Lilly, a crypto economist at Jarvis Labs, noted in a SubStack post dated April 22.      Now, however, the incentive to reinvest is relatively low. The so-called Grayscale carry trade has lost its shine ever since GBTC began trading at a discount in February. As of Wednesday, the shares traded at a discount of 12.17% to the net asset value, according to data source Skew.      Nevertheless, some analysts say the discount offers retail investors an opportunity to buy bitcoin on the cheap. ""Investors looking for long-term passive bitcoin exposure are probably better off buying GBTC over spot bitcoin since you get paid to wait more via the discount than you pay in excess fees,” David Grider, a strategist at investment research firm FundStrat, wrote in an email in May.      Also read: Record ‘Grayscale Discount’ Might Mean Bargain Bitcoin for Retail Traders      Bitcoin is currently trading near $33,200, representing a 1.2% drop on the day.

According to a report by the Australian Financial Review on Thursday, Dominic Stevens said his exchange's distributed ledger technology-based (DLT) settlement system was set to handle more value than all public blockchains housing crypto.      “We are moving two to three trillion dollars of securities onto this system, and that is larger than the whole global crypto world is sitting on the blockchain,” said Stevens in relation to his exchange's intended private and permissioned chain.      The total market value of all cryptos peaked at around $2.6 trillion on May 14 this year and was hovering just above $1.35 trillion at press time.      Stevens, who was speaking on the third day at the Macquarie Technology Summit, said the ASX's strategy around handling data was less to do with customer-facing tasks and more about how the ""ecosystem interacts with itself.""      “We want to make that a more collaborative ecosystem of data,” said Stevens, according to the report.

In an interview with NextAdvisor, Orman said she used PayPal to purchase the crypto. This is the first time Orman has acknowledged owning bitcoin directly.      Orman’s positive outlook on crypto separates her from many other celebrity financial advisers, such as Dave Ramsey, who has maintained a negative opinion of cryptocurrencies for years.      Prior to discussing her purchase of bitcoin, Orman had spoken several times about her interest in crypto and her investment in MicroStrategy stock last June, which she used as a proxy for bitcoin. Orman told NextAdvisor she bought MicroStrategy stock because she found it to be simpler than buying crypto directly.      “Truthfully, I didn’t really know how to buy a large amount of bitcoin,” Orman said. “Coinbase was aggravating me. I bought a little of it and then I sold some. It was just too complicated for me – even though it’s not complicated at all.”    Read more: PayPal Pushes Crypto Further Mainstream With Planned Checkout Service for 29M Merchants    Orman also expressed her frustration with the technical aspects of buying and holding crypto, including how to create a crypto wallet. PayPal, Orman said, made purchasing bitcoin easy because it allows users to purchase crypto without creating an external crypto wallet.      But Orman’s interview with NextAdvisor wasn’t all looking through rose-colored glasses: The financial guru also said she is concerned about bitcoin due to the regulatory crackdowns happening in China and the looming specter of U.S. regulation, which Orman thinks will be driven by the recent uptick in ransomware attacks.    Read more: China’s Anti-Crypto Crackdown Is Different This Time    Orman also said volatility is to be expected, and that bitcoin could drop as low as $12,000-$15,000. She is also concerned about the power of unofficial figureheads like Tesla CEO Elon Musk to move the crypto markets with “comments.”      “Even with all that said, I still am a fan of bitcoin,” Orman said. “I don’t plan to sell even my little amount, no matter what.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/24/suze-orman-says-she-bought-5k-of-bitcoin-using-paypal-and-shes-a-hodler,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c453359de0329594701016f9f1bd63fc946f4bc-1400x934.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In mid-April, Africrypt’s investors were sent an email claiming the platform was shutting down and freezing all accounts following a hack that compromised client accounts, wallets and nodes. Investors were reportedly asked not to report the hack to law enforcement, which the founders claimed would slow the recovery process.      However, shortly after the so-called hack, Africrypt’s founders – 20-year-old Ameer Cajee and 17-year-old Raees Cajee – allegedly transferred the pooled investor funds from an account at Johannesburg-based First National Bank (FNB) and disappeared to the U.K.    Read more: Crypto Crime Siphoned Off Nearly $10.5B in 2020: Research    Since freezing the accounts, the Cajee brothers apparently shuttered Africrypt’s website and have not returned investors’ calls.

Crypto scams are nothing new, but Africrypt could rank as one of the largest crypto cons in history.      Hanekom Attorneys, the Cape Town-based law firm hired by some of AfriCrypt’s investors, told Bloomberg the funds were put through a variety of tumblers and mixers, making them virtually untraceable.
