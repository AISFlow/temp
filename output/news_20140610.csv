REEDS Jewelers is headquartered in Wilmington, North Carolina. It has 64 retail locations in the eastern US as well as an online presence.  The retailer, which has been in business since 1946, tapped Coinbase to serve as its payment processor and is allowing its customers to pay using bitcoin both in-person and online.  Mitch Cahn, marketing director for REEDS, told CoinDesk that his company's decision to accept bitcoin is all about embracing the growing community surrounding digital currencies, saying:  ""There are a lot of people out there that have bitcoin. And they are looking for ways to convert it into other things. We want to be able to provide that as a service.""  Embracing technology  Cahn says that although the jewelry business is relatively traditional in nature, REEDS is trying to keep up with new digital trends.  ""We’re a very old industry. Us as a company in particular, we’re not bleeding-edge. But we’ve tried to stay pretty current,"" he said.  The jeweler was one of the first to have a website, which it first established in 1998. Since then, online sales have become a big part of its business. Because of this, each physical location has at least three iPads that link to a system with online access to REEDS' entire inventory.  Moves by large companies like Overstock to accept bitcoin made the integration a strategic one for REEDS. With tablets already in place, software configuration was pretty easy for the company to begin accepting BTC compared to older point-of-sale systems.  According to Cahn:  ""We see a trend, obviously we’re not the only retailer to do this by far. It’s not extremely difficult to implement. It wasn’t a huge undertaking.""  Opportunity for investors  Precious gold and diamonds, according to Cahn, can be considered ""semi-commodities"". REEDS believes bitcoin investors may be interested in diversifying, purchasing gold and diamonds with digital currency.  Another aspect of the business is that many jewelers such as REEDS also buy precious metals and other valuables.  Cahn says that after the 2008 global economic crisis,"" gold buying and diamond buying became a big part of the jewelry industry. [And] we always do trade-ins and repairs. It’s been a big part of our business.""  When asked if REEDS pay out in bitcoin for trade-ins from its customers, Cahn replied that such a service is not on the immediate horizon, saying:  ""We’re pretty progressive, but I don’t have answer for you on that. I’ll never say no to anything because you never know, but as of right now that’s not in the forecast.""  The company is not planning to hold onto bitcoin right now, using Coinbase to turn BTC proceeds into dollars.  ""For what it’s worth, we’re not holding on to the bitcoin. We are converting [it to fiat],"" said Cahn.

Erik Finman took $1,000 he received as a gift from his grandmother and invested it in bitcoin back in 2012, according to a report by Mashable. After holding his BTC for one year, Finman sold his bitcoins for $100,000.  Finman ultimately decided to reinvest his earnings into Botangle.com, an online video tutoring service that ""allows students and tutors access to a diverse array of resources that just do not exist in a normal classroom setting"", according to its official website.  Notably, Finman pays his employees in bitcoin. He told Mashable that he enjoys ""sharing the wealth of bitcoin"", saying:  ""I have no doubt it will be huger [sic] than anyone can imagine right now. Bitcoin is like the Internet in the '90s.""  Early bitcoin supporter  During a question-and-answer session that he took part in last month on the Entrepreneur subreddit, Finman explained how he first came to learn about bitcoin, writing:  ""I owe a lot to my older brother. He told me about bitcoins and help[ed] me get set up with 0.2 bitcoins that he gave me. And my grandmother just out of the blue gave me a $1,000 check for Easter.""  He continued by saying that he accrued more bitcoins ""so I can trump my brother in how many bitcoins he had"", adding that he first learned about bitcoin in 2010.  Luckily for Finman, he sold his stash of bitcoins when the price hovered around $1,200 per bitcoin.  Though entrepreneurs may not be able to replicate Finman's success, they can learn from those who have entered the industry through more conventional in-roads.

42377372,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70OSd,1402430432,Why Bitcoin Businesses Struggle to Get Insurance,"As early as the 2nd century BCE, Babylonian traders insured goods from loss at sea by paying a premium on loans. If they paid a little extra when they borrowed, the debt would be forgiven if a freak wave swallowed their cargo en route to market, or if pirates attacked their ships.  The bitcoin economy is drastically different, but the need to insure against theft or accidental loss remains. Recovering lost bitcoin is as impossible today as raising ships from the floor of the Mediterranean would have been for the Babylonians thousands of years ago.  Fulfilling that need is a different story, as to date, insurance companies have been hesitant to establish relationships with bitcoin businesses.  Lack of understanding  As CoinDesk reported last week, Lloyd’s, which was the first insurance company to protect a bitcoin storage service, was involved with bitcoin for a matter of weeks before its relationship with Elliptic Vault ended for reasons that are still unclear.  ""Insurance companies do not understand [bitcoin], and even fear it,"" Xapo CEO Wences Casares told CoinDesk.  Xapo is one of the few insured bitcoin companies at moment, with coverage provided by Bermuda-based company Meridian Insurance. The California-based company's policy is ""much larger than $15m"", according to Xapo's senior vice president of business development Ted Rogers, and part of the reserve is held in bitcoin.  ""For many [insurers], the technical risks are difficult to assess and understand – much less price,"" said Casares.  The challenge for Xapo was to persuade the insurers that they had reduced the risk of loss by implementing strong security standards, said Casares, adding:  ""We could not have this insurance if we had not made the investment we have made in the deep cold storage, multi-signature [wallets] and physical vaults.""  Getting insured isn’t a walk in the park, agreed Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, who announced at the Bitcoin2014 conference that Circle’s accounts would be fully insured by an unnamed insurer which is ""top rated from an SMP ratings perspective"".  ""[Insurance is] another expense, it's another level of accountability and audit, it's a major undertaking,"" Allaire told CoinDesk:  ""My understanding is that there have been quite a few companies that have, through brokers and others, pitched and have been unsuccessful in getting underwriting. And so I think that the bar is very high on what underwriters will look for from companies.""  Sceptical climate  The difficulty bitcoin businesses face when obtaining insurance is just part of the industry's wider struggling to normalize its affairs despite an atmosphere of scepticism.  The industry has faced similar problems when it comes to building relationships with banks and regulators, with the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK, for example, refusing to issue any guidance on bitcoin.  Combined with a non-existent or immature system of auditing for bitcoin-holding businesses, and it’s easy to see why insurance companies have been less than forthcoming with the industry.  Looking ahead  According to Allaire, insurance companies, while hesitant, are testing the waters at the moment.  ""Given the perceived higher risk a lot of these firms are keeping the [bitcoin] client base to a very small number and what they perceive to be high-quality operations – they want to learn the market and they want to do that in a controlled manner.""  One example of this approach is Great American Insurance Group, which announced last week that it will begin courting bitcoin businesses, first with a more narrow product offering aimed at crime and theft. Alhough, it isn't difficult to foresee its offerings expanding.  As the bitcoin ecosystem matures and becomes less of an exotic market for insurance companies, insured bitcoin companies will be the standard, just like mainstream financial companies.  ""It is a matter of time,"" said Casares.  Until then, bitcoin largely remains the all-or-nothing investment it always has been. For die-hards, that might be part of the appeal. For mainstream customers, it is a big turnoff.

42377358,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70OCH,1402427420,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Launches First Bitcoin ATM,"The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is now home to a new Liberty Teller bitcoin ATM, located at the MIT Coop store in Kendall Square, Cambridge, in an installation that marks MIT’s first on-campus bitcoin ATM.  The ATM launch represents another step in the development of what observers have labelled the development of the world’s first ""bitcoin economy” at MIT. Other aspects of the initiative include the distribution of $100 in bitcoin to undergraduates this coming fall, as well as the MIT Bitcoin Expo conference held in May.  The MIT Coop is a member profit-sharing cooperative first founded in 1882. The new bitcoin ATM operates Monday through Saturday and is located just inside the entrance.  Liberty Teller  co-founder Chris Yim told CoinDesk that the store was a natural fit for the ATM operator given its community-oriented focus, saying:  ""Their model is very much in line with the value proposition bitcoin provides for merchants and consumers which is simple, transparent transactions with minimal processing fees.""  He added that the Coop is currently looking at accepting bitcoin as a form of payment.  Bitcoin emerges at MIT  Yim explained that the Liberty Teller launch at the Coop makes sense given the broader introduction of bitcoin currently taking place on campus. In addition to the bitcoin distribution, the MIT Bitcoin Project is sponsoring a summer-long app contest.  He said:  ""With the MIT Bitcoin Project taking place this fall, it made a lot of sense to have a bitcoin ATM right next to campus so people could familiarize themselves with or acquire bitcoin in advance of the distribution.""  Yim added that interest on the part of the MIT bitcoin community led to the Coop's decision to launch the bitcoin ATM. He added that Liberty Teller is working with the MIT Bitcoin Project on a number of plans, with the ATM installation at the Coop forming one part of the on-campus bitcoin expansion.  Bitcoin takes root in Cambridge  The Liberty Teller ATM at the Coop may the first on-campus machine, but it isn’t Liberty Teller’s first foray into the broader Boston community.  In May  , Liberty Teller celebrated the launch of an ATM at restaurant Moska in Cambridge. The pan-Asian tapas establishment is located just off campus, and is in prime position to offer services to a bitcoin-enhanced community.  Moska is one of several local businesses that have begun accepting bitcoin, making the Coop-based ATM the right move for the community, explained Liberty Teller co-founder Kyle Powers, who stated:  ""There are now local merchants directly accepting bitcoin for payment for everything from dumplings to cocktails to tax advice. We are still in the very early days, but momentum is strong.""  Liberty Teller has launched its ATMs elsewhere in Boston, including temporary installations in Harvard Station and South Station.  The Liberty Teller ATM at MIT joins a growing pantheon of machines worldwide, which can be found on CoinDesk’s global bitcoin ATM map.

42377354,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70O9l,1402423549,Italian Parliament to Host First Bitcoin Hearings this June,"Italy's House of Parliament is set to hold two hearings on the risks, promises and opportunities posed by bitcoin and other digital currency technologies this June as the government seeks to conduct broader fact-finding on the subject.  The events will bring together local lawmakers, academics and international representatives from the bitcoin industry. The first meeting is set to take place on 11th June, featuring participation from parliament member Stefano Quintarelli and Senate Vice President of Treasury and Finance Committee Francesco Molinari, among others.  Organised by digital payment advocacy group CashlessWay, the second event will take place on 26th June. Notable speakers will include Stefano Pepe, co-founder of independent local trade association Bitcoin Foundation Italy, parliament member Sergio Boccadutri and Robocoin CEO Jordan Kelley.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Boccadutri said that the events will mark the first time that the country's institutions, businesses and entrepreneurs will be able to discuss bitcoin and its potential impact on Italy's economy openly.  The lawmaker said:  ""My goal is to create, for the first time, a real and rational debate about cryptocurrencies, studying all the aspects of the new phenomenon: not only the business opportunities, but also the tax implications and the controls to avoid criminal activities.""  The news follows a January proposal authored by Boccadutri that sought to impose cash-like restrictions, including mandatory reporting requirements, on bitcoin transactions exceeding €1,000.  Technical overview  Sebastiano Scrofina, of local bitcoin consultancy and 11th June meeting organiser CoinCapital, indicates the first of two unaffiliated meetings will focus onhttp://www.coincapital.it/2014/06/10/i-bitcoin-entrano-a-montecitorio/ educating lawmakers, law enforcement agencies and members of Italy's traditional banking industry.  Scrofina expects around 15 representatives from parliament to attend what he called a ""high-level discussion"" on digital currency:  ""Oftentimes, in Italy, politicians just don't dig deeper into the topic. Our goal is to explain in detail the technology, the block chain, the difference between bitcoin and altcoins and block chain forensics in technical detail.""  The closed meetinghttp://www.coincapital.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Invito-Camera-Bitcoin-11-Giugno.pdf will run from 14:30 to 18:50 local time, and also feature an open question-and-answer session.  Eye toward regulation  In contrast to the 11th June meeting, the second event will be open to the public and will involve international participation in the form of Robocoin CEO Kelley, though the final speaker schedule has yet to be confirmed.  As yet, Boccadutri is the only member from the parliament attending, though he has been perhaps the most active lawmaker on the topic. Boccadutri eventually tabled his controversial January proposal, but has continued to advocate for the Italian government to learn more about digital currencies.  For example, on 5th June, Boccadutri called for the country's House Budget Committee to conduct an inquiry of the technology, arguing that the research is necessary so that Italy can keep pace with regulators in other nations such as Germany and the US that have been more active on the issue.  Boccadutri said:  ""A survey from the point of view of the legislature is necessary, from my point of view, to deepen the treatment of so-called 'transactions' that occur in digital currency in our country.""  The Palermo native further indicated that such findings would also be beneficial should the government decided to regulate such financial activity domestically.  Community debut  Members of the local bitcoin ecosystem said they will be ready to rise to the occasion this June in what will be the first presentations by the community to the government body.  Andrea Medri, a member of Bitcoin Foundation Italy and local digital currency trading platform The Rock Trading, will be attending the 11th June event as a spectator and the 26th June event as a speaker.  He indicated that he looks forward to the 26th June meeting, as it will provide the local ecosystem the opportunity to showcase a common strategy, as well as educate Boccadutri on the concerns of the community.  CoinCapital's Scrofina echoed this assessment, saying his organisation's event marks an important advancement in what he hopes will become an ongoing discussion in Italy:  ""This is a good first step, it means the legislators want to just learn more about the phenomenon.""

42377367,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70ONb,1402419619,How Cryptocurrency Mining Could Help Archive Society's Important Data,"We all know that bitcoin miners spend their time earning money by computing the huge number of sums that secure the bitcoin network. The problem is that this sizeable resource doesn’t have any other use. It also takes a lot of energy to run.  However, there are alternatives to this way of working, offering more intrinsic purpose to all that computational power. The latest one comes from a research team that wants to use a cryptocurrency network to store archival data. Say hello to permacoin.  What is proof of work?  Bitcoins are 'mined’ using computing power, in a process known as 'proof of work'. The idea is to balance the time it takes to produce new bitcoins, so that each of them is produced in equal time (that's currently set to 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes or so).  To do that, all of the miners on the bitcoin network try to solve a mathematical problem, and the difficulty of that problem varies depending on how many people are trying to crack it.  As more people try to mine bitcoins, the difficulty increases, meaning that it takes more computing power to solve the problem. The proof of work necessary to earn a bitcoin rises, taking more computing cycles for the same outcome. This cycle of increased consumption has been growing exponentially since late last year.  Using storage instead of computing power  The folks behind permacoin come from the University of Maryland, Cornell Tech and Microsoft Research. Led by Andrew Miller, a computer science PhD student at the University of Maryland, the team proposes that we use storage, rather than CPU cycles, to secure a cryptocurrency network – providing a useful way to back up our public data in the process.  Instead of burning through proof of work which has no intrinsic value beyond the network, Miller and his team want miners to store pieces of a large archive of data that society would like to see preserved – the Library of Congress, perhaps.  They suggest this can be achieved by having miners prove that they are storing those pieces of data, in the same way that the bitcoin network makes its miners prove that they have solved mathematical problems.  Miners still have to prove that they have solved a mathematical problem, but the problem needn't get more difficult as more miners joined the network.  Instead, the miners must refer to a piece of code stored locally on their computer to solve the puzzle. If they successfully solve the problem, then the algorithm can deduce that they are storing that data – at least for a short time. Thus, all miners must be storing a piece of the archived data to participate by mining permacoin.  There’s another smart aspect to permacoin known as 'erasure coding', which increases the size of a file slightly, padding it with extra data. Then, even if some sections have been erased, that extra data makes it possible to retrieve a file in its entirety, within limitations.  The case for a distributed archival network  This all sounds plausible, but why bother? Storage is cheap, after all, and in the permacoin academic paper, Miller’s team admits that the amount of storage theoretically available seems relatively low compared to conventional cloud-based storage.  Miller conservatively estimates that bitcoin miners have spent $80m on equipment. If they’d spent that on RAM instead, they could have bought around four petabytes (4 million gigabytes) of RAM storage capacity, he says.  That isn't how much the network would store, however. In the paper, Miller quarters the 4 PB figure, just to be on the safe side, concluding that bitcoin’s users could safely store a 200 TB file if everyone had bought storage instead of computing muscle power.  Two hundred terabytes is pretty small potatoes in the storage world (although estimates say it is sufficient to store the aforementioned Library of Congress print collection), and online archiving is already available, via services such as Amazon’s Glacier.  Decentralized archives  Miller insists that what permacoin lacks in storage capacity, it makes up for in risk mitigation and diversity.  ""The main advantage of permacoin isn't just the amount of data being stored, it's the diverse and decentralized way in which it's stored,"" he said.  ""Even the Amazon Glacier storage service, which offers replicated storage in multiple geographic locations, is confined to Amazon's administrative domain [ie: it's under their control],"" Miller continued. ""The goal of permacoin is to inherit the same kind decentralized security provided by bitcoin currently, with no central party responsible for the data.""  Miller’s approach is slightly different than other decentralized archival projects that have been around for a while, such as Stanford University’s LOCKSS (Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff Safe), for example. That has software which monitors participating computers to check that they’re still holding the files they’re listed as holding, thus ensuring that enough pieces of data are around at any one time to reconstruct a file.  While LOCKSS relies on altruistic participants within a special interest group, permacoin’s approach incentivises miners to store by enabling them to produce more permacoins.  Jeff Garzik  , one of bitcoin's core developers, is a big fan of Miller and said that the idea has potential:  ""Andrew Miller is a sharp guy. That bootstraps a lot of my personal trust into the system, sight unseen. Proof-of-storage can work.""  Who might use it?  Miller prefers to call it 'proof of retrievability', because the permacoin network can prove its ability to get archived files back. Whatever the underlying technology is called, it could be a good way to solve some of the more pressing problems facing organizations with large data stores – especially those who are operating on a non-profit basis.  Take the Internet Archive, for example, which aims to provide ""universal access to all knowledge"". That now has more than 10 petabytes spread across multiple data centres. Brewster Kahle, who founded the Archive in 1996, said that projects like permacoin have promise:  ""The public data in the World Wide Web and elsewhere is growing rapidly, and the cost of hard drives is not falling as fast, so the overall cost of archiving the published works is growing. While it is still manageable, it is something that sustained funding can help insure long lasting and up-to-date collections.""  ""The Internet Archive and the Wayback Machine could be well served with a distributed system,"" he added.  There are other alternative systems to CPU- or ASIC-intensive proof of work, such as solarcoin, which only uses miners to process the transaction of pre-mined coins on its network. The coins are exchanged for proven production of solar energy.  Primecoin  , produced by 'Sunny King', searches for a specific type of prime number, and has just achieved its fifth world record doing so. However, King admits that these numbers are primarily of theoretical relevance:  ""The main practical benefit is that it provides incentives to the development of primality testing related ASIC computing devices, which is a great benefit to cryptography and computing industry in general.""  Computational power can be used for other things, such as distributed protein folding and searching for patterns in extraterrestrial radio signals. The problem is that computing tasks like these aren’t the same types of task as solving the cryptography problems intrinsic to cryptocurrency production, and no one seems to have worked out a way to marry the two so far. This means curing cancer or AIDS, while also mining digital coins isn’t a reality.  However, storing data while mining digital coins is.  ""We designed our [scheme] to closely match the performance and security of bitcoin,"" concludes Miller. ""If the same amount of money were invested towards equipment and power in permacoin, it would have the same security as bitcoin does now.""  We don’t see anyone changing the core bitcoin proof of work in the near future, though, and permacoin hasn’t yet been implemented. Miller and his team have contributed the theory – will anyone take the next step?

The US bankruptcy court granted the company’s request on 7th June after it filed for bankruptcy protection two days earlier.  The move closes a turbulent chapter in HashFast’s history, nearly a month after laying off half of its workforce and publicly denying that it was filing for bankruptcy.  According to a 10th June blog post, the company is now in the process of reorganizing under Chapter 11. Most notably, CEO Eduardo DeCastro has resigned from his position as part of a broader reduction in HashFast’s operating team. Chief technology officer Simon Barber is now serving as interim president of HashFast, the company announced.  Additionally, HashFast has hired Chicago-based law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP to chart its path through bankruptcy.  In a statement, HashFast said that a Chapter 11 reorganization is good news for creditors as opposed to a Chapter 7 liquidation:  “Our focus is to reorganize the company in a way that provides added value to our creditors, versus a liquidation scenario that would be of less value.”  Rehabilitation ahead  By entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy, HashFast now has an opportunity to restructure its debt and operations while still functioning as a business.  Under Chapter 11, a bankruptcy trustee is appointed to oversee the reorganization. During this time, a company seeks to change the terms of its debt via counselling with creditors. In some cases, a successful restructuring allows for the repayment of loans, generally with a reduced interest rate or different principal amount.  In addition to hiring Hatten Muchin Rosenman, HashFast has tapped a new chief financial officer, Monica Hushen, to oversee “business operations and bankruptcy matters,” the company said in its statement.  HashFast added that more information is to come regarding its bankruptcy path, saying:  “We will be sharing more specific information regarding our reorganization efforts over the coming days.”  CoinDesk reached out to HashFast for comment but had not received a response at press time.  Narrowly avoided liquidation  Prior to being granted Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, HashFast came close to being forced into Chapter 7, a type of bankruptcy that results in asset liquidation.  One of the company’s creditors, LiquidBits, sought to persuade a US bankruptcy court in May to appoint a Chapter 7 trustee for HashFast. At the time, the firm said that HashFast failed to honor a $6m order.  An emergency hearing was held to hear both sides’ arguments, but ultimately, US Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali sided with HashFast and allowed it to continue operating in a limited capacity.

Designed to protect businesses and customers using digital currencies, the controls will also provide an environment that enables companies operating within the space to flourish.  Peter Greenhill, the department’s director of E-Business Development, said: ""The Isle of Man recognises both the risks and opportunities presented by digital and virtual currencies.""  He added:  ""The government has instructed the relevant departments and statutory bodies to ensure there is a regime that promotes both business opportunities but also applies appropriate anti-money laundering requirements.""  Greenhill said the Isle of Man's Financial Supervision Commission (FSC), the Department of Home Affairs and the industry will work together to ensure a fair policy is developed and implemented.  He went on to say the Isle of Man recognises that the digital currency market will ""develop and change rapidly,"" so any rules created will be kept under review and updated as and when it is appropriate.  The government is keen to state that it is not creating specific regulation for digital currencies, instead, it is intending to include them under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2008 and the Designated Business (Registration and Oversight) Bill 2014.  Excellent news  R Paul Davis, group general counsel for Counting House Services, labelled the move ""excellent"" news. According to Davis, the Isle of Man is saying ""welcome"" to bitcoin businesses, providing they are compliant and operate to best standards.  ""They cannot come here to launder money, defraud the public, or damage the island’s reputation. But they can pitch their tent here, do their business, build their software and offer their services,"" he added.  Davis said the most important factor to note is that currency businesses will be able to register with the FSC, adding:  ""The Isle of Man has stopped short of establishing a bespoke regulatory regime, because that needs more time. But banks, service providers, landlords and technology companies on the island can all be confident that digital currency development has full government support and the FSC is not going to penalize anyone for engaging in the sector.""  He highlighted that government grants and incentives will also be available to digital developers and entrepreneurs who want to call the island home.  Previous ruling  Back in March, Davis received a ruling from the island’s Financial Supervision Commission stating that bitcoin exchanges do not require licences to operate within the Isle of Man.  However, the ruling stated that the situation could change:  ""[...] it is possible that legislation could be amended in the future to bring the proposed activities within regulated activity and/or to make the activity subject to the AML Code and thus subject to the draft Designated Businesses (Registration and Oversight) Bill 2014.""  The Isle of Man is known for having a favourable tax regime, with residents being taxed at 20% on incomes up to £120,000 per year, businesses paying no corporate tax and banks only 10%.  Charlie Woolnough, chairman of the Manx Digital Currency Association, said these favourable limits, plus the government's new announcement, all help in the island's move towards becoming the domicile of choice for digital currency companies.  The Isle of Man government has explained its new stance on digital currencies clearly in a question and answer document.

42377376,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70OWP,1402401775,Robocoin 2.0 Arrives With Bank-Like Features and New Hardware,"Bitcoin ATM provider Robocoin enters a new phase of its growth today with the announcement of 'Robocoin 2.0’, featuring a totally new software platform, alongside improved hardware and extra features aimed at the global banking and remittance markets.      With the announcement, the Las Vegas-based manufacturer takes a big step toward towards its previously stated ambition to make bitcoin more user-friendly for mass-market consumers and its aim to provide financial services for the world's underbanked.    Bitcoin 'banking'    Repositioning itself more as a bank with 'branches' instead of ATMs, Robocoin is offering a variety of online accounts for merchants, brokers and general customers.      Allowing users access to the company's machines in all of the 13 countries it currently covers, Robocoin accounts also feature integral bitcoin wallets, removing the need to use wallet QR codes or addresses when depositing or withdrawing.      With public confidence in centralised bitcoin companies at a low following notable collapses like Mt. Gox, the company insists that customers’ bitcoins are ""securely stored"" in a Robocoin wallet ""built on industry leading multi-sig architecture with 100% provable reserves and offline cold storage"".      Another issue that has plagued users of both bitcoin ATMs and merchant point-of-sales systems is the potentially long wait while transactions are confirmed on the block chain. Robocoin now sidesteps this issue completely by taking transaction off-block chain, promising that ATM customers can access their accounts and ""get cash and bitcoin instantly"".    Global payments    The company's ATMs accept and dispense 12 national currencies worldwide and can now be used to send money to anyone using only their phone number or email address, even if they haven't signed up for a Robocoin account. Recipients need merely to visit the local 'branch' to pick up their cash.      With traditional remittance providers such as MoneyGram and Western Union currently reaping vast profits in transfer fees – estimated at around $500bn a year – such a service could see significant savings for workers sending money back home to families.      Even with the relatively low fees that will likely be offered, this is a lucrative market that Robocoin and bitcoin exchanges such as Bitex.la and Coincove hope to tap into.      ""Our goal is to make storing and sending money faster, friendlier, cheaper and easier than any other company in the world,"" said Jordan Kelley, Robocoin's CEO, adding:      ""Robocoin is expanding the bitcoin market by making it easier. No more downloading a digital wallet, storing a private key, or remembering public addresses. New technology and terminology mean secure deposits, instant withdraws, and the easiest way to send money worldwide.""            The hardware  Along with its announcement of its new platform, Robocoin has also announced a slashed price on its standard bitcoin ATM, plus two new machines with extra features to facilitate security and speedy transactions.  Having reached new scale milestones and improved its supply chain, the company has now dropped the base price for its Robocoin Classic unit from $20,000 to $15,000, while reassuring operators that its ATMs are still made with ""top-of-the line, bank-grade hardware"".  Robocoin  is also launching a range of 'recycling' ATMs, which feature the ability to dispense the cash they accept.  This, in turn, reduces the need for frequent restocking and the security risks involved with regularly handling cash in a public-facing premises. The new hardware handles notes more quickly, further speeding up customer transactions.  The company's $20,000 base model, the Robocoin Recycler, can accept two bills per second and can dispense at a rate of 1.6 notes per second. In addition, it can hold up to 1,900 notes, the company said.  Its premium counterpart, the Robocoin Recycler Max ($35,000) provides a 100-note batch acceptor and can accept and dispense at a ""market-leading"" rate of eight bills per second. It can hold 8,300 notes and recycles 6,000 with three different denominations, Robocoin claims, adding that this is the most premium bitcoin ATM in the world.  Robocoin ATMs employ biometric authentication technology, as well as phone and PIN authentication, to protect user accounts and where necessary comply with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations.  Competitor Lamassu promises bitcoin-to-fiat transactions in under 15 seconds, and currently accepts notes from 200 countries worldwide. The company recently introduced an optional ATM stand that allows two-way transactions.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/10/robocoin-20-arrives-with-bank-like-features-and-new-hardware,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/377b9a7f650bce4627d17544fd4a715dd965acd2-846x484.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377377,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70OV9,1402399936,Wealthico Launches Mint.com Alternative for Cryptocurrency Investors,"Prague's digital currency-centric financial management service Wealthico has officially launched, offering a free 30-day trial to select new customers.  The wealth tracking tool boasts support for more than 300 altcoins – including automated address tracking for 80 digital currencies, and offers users the ability to login through popular social media platforms such as Facebook, Google and LinkedIn.  With the unveiling, Wealthico enters a budding sector of the digital currency market already partly served by competitors including CryptFolio, CoinFinance and MyAltCoins. However, the service is aiming to differentiate itself with novel tweaks to the established model.  For example, Wealthico allows users to track the movements of traditional stocks alongside entries in their digital currency portfolios, a move that CEO and founder Karel Javurek thinks will position the company to attract a more mainstream audience, even as it hones in on a very specific market segment.  As a former day trader in cryptocurrency himself, Javurek believes a solution that caters to this underserved market is much needed. He told CoinDesk:  ""We see a lot of startups with wallets and exchanges, but nobody is focusing on the user [who wants] to see how much wealth they have. When you have a lot of altcoins, it's very difficult to track them all and you worry about how much you have.""  Service overview  Wealthico offers users a clean interface that tracks digital currency investments on their behalf. However, it's emphasis is on the real wealth that users accumulate with their holdings.  For example, for each digital currency user's track, Wealthico displays the amount of the currency, the value of this currency in US dollars and the total actual wealth that users have accumulated through that investment.  Movements can then be sorted by day, week or month.  To add a digital currency to their central dashboard, users create a new 'card' for the currency, which is filled out with their receiving address or addresses and the volume of the currency contained in these accounts.  Cards can then be pinned to a user's main screen. Free users are able to add three cards for digital currency tracking and three cards for stock tracking, but are unable to set alerts.  Premium accounts cost $4.99 in BTC, though users can save 35% with a 12-month subscription.  Sizing up the competition  Though a newcomer to the digital currency ecosystem, Javurek believes that Wealthico already has the edge on its competitors. He cites difficulties using other available market solutions, critiquing these offerings as having very basic features – if they work at all.  He also indicated that Wealthico will look to differentiate by providing a more stable service and seeking to integrate its service into other popular offerings, stating:  ""Right now, we are focusing on cryptocurrency, and we building a platform for that. Even in the Android app, we will add some support for another company like Coinbase, BitPay and so on, so we add some functionality for paying.""  The CEO says he plans to stop short of turning Wealthico into a full-fledged trading platform, however, noting: ""We don't need to be a trading platform, we want to be the one place where you look for financial statistics.""  Competing against Mint  While Javurek shies away from the comparison, he sees his service as analogous to Mint.com, the popular web-based personal financial management tool.  Though he acknowledges Wealthico faces a real threat should Mint.com ever add support for digital currencies, Javurek sees Wealthico having value by taking a different approach, one that doesn't require the centralization of user data on his company's computers.  ""Mint is the biggest competitor that can add cryptocurrencies, but we think we have a very nice and simple design with our cards. Mint is tracking whether you buy coffee or something like that, they are connected to the credit cards and so on.""  Going forward, Javurek foresees adding additional sections to Wealthico's dashboard over time, including new features that would allow users to track the wealth they have stored in assets like cars and properties that have been overlooked by more traditional competitors.  However, for now, his focus remains on building the existing product, securing new team members, and potentially, raising new funding.

42377396,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70OML,1402394834,Ripple Labs Joins Mainstream NACHA Financial Industry Alliance,"Ripple Labs announced yesterday it has joined the NACHA Payments Innovation Alliance – a move it says will increase its influence within the financial and payments industry, as well as help promote new technologies in the space.  NACHA  , previously the National Automated Clearing House Association, is a not-for-profit industry body of financial institutions that serves as trustee for the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, the backbone for electronic payments and movement of money and financial data in the US.  The ACH Network is similar to the SWIFT network that facilitates international money movements.  Although Ripple Labs is a software company rather than a financial institution per se, it provides an open-source base platform ""that resides at the bottom of the payment stack"" for others to build upon.  Ideally, the company sees itself as replacing some of the most basic infrastructure functions of the ACH network:  The company posted the following statement on its blog:  ""Our membership with the NACHA Alliance provides us with further opportunity to further our mission of working with everyone within the industry to help drive innovation around the movement of money.""  Enterprise focus  Ripple Labs has always claimed the Ripple protocol is perfectly suited for use by financial institutions and enterprise, saying its involvement has been a long-standing drive by the company.  Patrick Griffin, the company's EVP of Business Development, said:    ""Ripple is an Internet protocol that enables financial institutions to securely transfer funds in any currency in real time. Our enterprise focus is to help banks, money transmitters and clearing houses use Ripple for bilateral settlement and straight through processing.""      ""For developers, the protocol is free and open. Developers can build new payment services or tools to migrate legacy payment systems to Ripple. By empowering these different stakeholders, we can enable the world to move and exchange value like information is shared today.""    Increasing compliance  Recent announcements and improvements reflect this stance. On 4th June, the company announced it was working to add features to its protocol that would empower gateways to freeze non-XRP balances they have marked for further investigation if they suspect related accounts have been hijacked or are engaging in suspicious behaviour.  The new features are part of Ripple Labs' commitment to helping gateways with regulatory compliance and giving those gateways tools to better manage compromised and suspicious balances, according to the Ripple wikihttps://ripple.com/wiki/Freeze.  The protocol will soon gain new messaging and identity features, plus other tools to allow stakeholders to identify such suspicious activity and communicate it to other users who wish to avoid those accounts.  'Suspicious activity' would involve money laundering, fraud, or other attempts to manipulate digital currencies and their networks.  Stakeholders would still have the freedom to decide whether or not to implement the tools and enforce risk controls, but could highlight the increased compliance in advertising to potential new customers.  Ripple Labs says it is working on these improvements in order to be more regulation, compliance and law-enforcement friendly – words that will be reassuring to the traditional financial industry.  About NACHA  NACHA represents over 11,000 US financial institutions who fund the organization either directly or via regional associations. The ACH Network itself, which is separate, moves about 22 billion transactions and $39tn (yes, trillion) annually.  NACHA members cooperate to set private sector operating rules including risk management and security of the network, with a mission ""to facilitate the expansion and diversification of electronic payments on the ACH Network.""

42377371,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70ORN,1402372907,"Blockchain's SharedCoin Users Can Be Identified, Says Security Expert","Bitcoin users in need of serious transaction privacy should avoid popular services like Blockchain's SharedCoin and other CoinJoin implementations, according to a well-known security expert.  Consultant Kristov Atlas, author of the bookhttp://anonymousbitcoinbook.com/ Anonymous Bitcoin, published a security advisory today saying weaknesses in SharedCoin offered privacy only from ""unskilled examiners of the bitcoin blockchain"" – and even then, only until more sophisticated analysis tools were made user-friendly enough for the average user to deploy.  Blockchain CEO Nicolas Cary said he was satisfied with the research and the way it was handled:  ""We've been in close communications with Kristov and appreciate his diligence. He takes privacy seriously and so do we.""  CoinJoin Sudoku  Using a software tool he created himself called 'CoinJoin Sudoku', Atlas analyzed thousands of transactions identified as using SharedCoin and determined he could identify relationships between specific payments and payees.  Coinjoin Sudoku  works by searching for common ownership of the multiple transaction inputs and outputs that SharedCoin uses to obscure identity, grouping them where ingoing and outgoing amounts match.  Blockchain  has responded to the warning with a blog post reminding customers that SharedCoin and CoinJoin offer protection only against ""casual observers"".  ""They do not prevent a determined investigator from correlating transactions or an adversary with information about specific addresses from correlating them to specific payments and payees.""  How SharedCoin works  Blockchain.info's  SharedCoin service is an open-sourcehttps://github.com/blockchain/Sharedcoin implementation of the CoinJoin privacy protocol, and is often referred to as a 'mixer'.  While transactions on the bitcoin blockchain are open for all to see (at least at the public address level), SharedCoin will collect a group of users wishing to increase privacy and join their transactions into one 'master transaction' before broadcasting it to the network.  The transaction that then appears on the blockchain would have multiple outputs and inputs, supposedly making it worthless for analysis.  Customers may select the number of times to repeat the SharedCoin process, between two and ten.  While offering enhanced privacy to users, SharedCoin and mixing services hope to better protect all users by making the bitcoin blockchain overall a less dependable tool for connecting bitcoin addresses to individuals.  Need for privacy  Blockchain officially began offering SharedCoin as a free service to its users last November, around the time Matt Mellon's 'CoinValidation' and other services appeared, which promised to track specific bitcoins and addresses connected to suspicious or other investigation-worthy activity. It did not claim, however, to provide 100% protection from such services.  Older style mixing tools (also known as 'tumblers') would forward a payment around several different addresses to make the originator hard to find, usually on a private server, or 'off-chain'. Such systems, however, required trust from users that anonymous operators would not simply confiscate or steal the bitcoins before they emerged from the mixer.  SharedCoin, and the CoinJoin protocol itself, provided a system that required less trust in the operator, by taking advantage of a bitcoin transaction's ability to have multiple inputs and outputs.  Crunching through transactions  Atlas analyzed 20,000 transactions across 45 blocks on the bitcoin block chain and found around 2.6% fit the profile of a SharedCoin transaction.  CoinJoin Sudoku identified groups within a transaction with equal amounts (marked red and blue in the diagram below) then examined inputs and outputs one digit at a time to identify possible relationships.  Currently, he wrote, the new tool is still inefficient and required over 30 hours to complete the analysis on a single processor, even with testing limitations he introduced. More thorough de-anonymization would take much longer, though it remained possible.  ""Despite the limitation, the tool was able to group 69% of inputs and 53% of a single transaction’s outputs.""  Through this kind of grouping, he could identify a maximum of two users within that transaction.  Atlas recommended anyone using SharedCoin set the number of cycles to the maximum 10, while remembering that even this did not guarantee 100% privacy.  Taint  Blockchain provides a 'Taint Analysis' tool to test traceability of funds and is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of mixers. If it works, users should not be able to identify sending addresses in the list.  Atlas says the Taint Analysis is a ""poor measurement"" for this, identifying a 100% and 50% chance of relationship between an output and two inputs, where the Taint Analysis had claimed 4.2% and 4.5% respectively.  He plans to release CoinJoin Sudoku as an open-source project in two weeks. The delay, he said, was to provide SharedCoin users with adequate time to take the steps necessary to protect their privacy.  Blockchain response  Blockchain disclosed that it paid Atlas a bounty (via SharedCoin) for finding the vulnerability and had worked with him to coordinate a schedule to release the information:    ""Blockchain.info sincerely appreciates the thoughtful nature of this disclosure from community member Kristov Atlas. We look forward to working with Mr. Atlas and other security researchers, on future improvements and enhancements to SharedCoin.""      ""As always, Blockchain.info is committed to transparency, the community, and improving bitcoin services for everyone.""    The company invited everyone to visit its GitHub repository to review its many open-source projects.  ""If you want to truly hide transactions, SharedCoin and other implementations of CoinJoin are not for you, they are neither sufficient nor convenient. SharedCoin provides a basic level of enhanced privacy transaction but doesn’t guarantee anonymity nor was it intended to.""  Blockchain saw SharedCoin's primary user base as corporations wishing to protect privacy of payroll and bill payments, individuals wishing not to display records of salaries or tips, and political and charitable organizations protecting their donors.  SharedCoin, Blockchain says, is actually ""not a mixing service"" as it never controls or sends any funds on behalf of its users.  Repeating a warning often given to anyone who claims the bitcoin payment network is 'anonymous', the company said anyone with sufficient time, money, motivation and computing power could correlate transaction outputs and inputs.
