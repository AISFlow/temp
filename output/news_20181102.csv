42429931,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2BVh,1541194221,There's a New Plan to Build the Hardware for Ethereum 2.0,"The Ethereum Foundation is funding efforts to create specializing mining hardware in partnership with blockchain data storage network Filecoin.  Announced Thursday at Devcon, the annual gathering of developers in Prague, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake unveiled preliminary designs for application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, that will support an upcoming ethereum technology called the ""beacon chain.""  In essence, the beacon chain is a random number generator, and it's expected to form part of the next major iteration of the ethereum network – ethereum 2.0 – under an alternative, proof-of-stake consensus protocol (compared to the proof-of-work approach utilized today).  While the term ""ASIC"" in the cryptocurrency space is more commonly associated with the technology applied to mining, the proposed ethereum 2.0 hardware isn't engaging in that same, computationally-intensive process.  Instead, these ASIC devices will engage in a comparatively less costly operation known as the Verifiable Delay Function. This helps to shuffle the validators that are intended to replace miners in ethereum's proof-of-stake system. The idea is that the hardware will prevent any one individual or organization from coalescing enough power to overtake system operations.  All told, the project is estimated to cost between $20 million and $30 million, according to Drake. That includes $15 million to $25 million for research and development, as well as $5 million to build an estimated 5,000 machines.  At present, the Ethereum Foundation and Filecoin – which raised more than $250 million through an initial coin offering (ICO) last year – are currently splitting costs for a project viability study to the order of ""a few hundred thousand dollars,"" said Drake in email to CoinDesk.  Looking at the work ahead, Drake struck a positive tone – particularly the prospect of designing and implementing the plan in an open-source fashion.  ""Open-source ASICs haven't really been done before so it's all very exciting for me,"" Drake remarked.  Correction: Filecoin has not committed to funding full research and development expenditures for this project.

Coinbase announced Friday that it would begin accepting BAT deposits as of 20:00 UTC to its professional trading platform for at least 12 hours, at which point it will enable trading. The company is not yet adding the token to its retail trading platforms, including coinbase.com or its iOS and Android apps.  As with other launches, the token will be added in four stages: transfer-only, when customers can deposit, post-only, when customers can post limit orders, limit-only when customers can begin matching orders and full trading.  Customers in New York will not immediately be able to trade BAT.  As part of the integration process, the company stated:  ""Once sufficient liquidity is established, trading on the BAT/USDC order book will start. Users may convert their USD to USDC with one click within the Pro interface.""  Price movement  As can be seen in the above chart, BAT began to surge at 20:00 UTC on the dot. Its price quickly jumped 28 percent in less than five minutes to reach a three month high of $0.33 cents, according to data from the Binance exchange.  Further, over $15 million worth of BAT was traded in that 5-minute span on Binance alone – an amount greater than the entire previous day.  BAT is the latest token to be listed on the Coinbase platform, following the 0x Protocol token (ZRX) and the USD//Coin stablecoin (USDC), both of which were added last month.  The exchange already supports bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ethereum and ethereum classic.  Sam Ouimet contributed reporting.

42429912,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM277h,1541181906,Here's What 3 Lawyers Have to Say About That Cryptic Tether Letter,"UPDATE (19:10 UTC, Nov. 2, 2018): This article has been updated to include a comment from the chairman of Deltec, Jean Chalopin.      As with any communication from Tether these days, a letter from Bahamas-based Deltec Bank has seemingly been parsed as closely as a passage from holy writ.  Commentators on Twitter and elsewhere picked apart every one of its fewer-than-100 words, including the non-committal wisp of a signature – which inevitably became a meme and the subject of parody – and even the document's metadata.  In releasing the letter this week, the controversial stablecoin issuer was trying to allay concerns about its banking situation by confirming its previously rumored relationship with Deltec and showing proof that it has enough money to fully back the tether (USDT) tokens in circulation.  Specifically, the letter ""confirm[ed] that, at the close of business on October 31, 2018, the portfolio cash value of your account with our bank was US$1,831,322,828.""  That exceeds the circulating supply of tether, which is currently 1,776,421,736 USDT, according to CoinMarketCap, apparently indicating that the company is complying with its promise to hold one dollar for every tether in circulation.  But aspects of the letter attracted scrutiny from the crypto commentariat, some of whom have long harbored suspicions about Tether's claims to fully collateralize USDT. Not helping to clarify matters, when reached by CoinDesk Friday, a Deltec spokesperson would neither confirm nor deny the relationship or the authenticity of the letter, citing legal and regulatory restrictions.  However, later in the day, Deltec chairman Jean Chalopin messaged CoinDesk saying the following:  ""You contacted us a couple of weeks ago and asked a confirmation that we could not give you, as restricted by law. But Tether came public with an announcement and I wanted to make sure you saw it. Sorry we could not be more helpful before: As you know the banking sector is strongly regulated and we have to be careful in matter of communication.""  Chalopin included a link to Tether's announcement.  So CoinDesk spoke to several industry lawyers to find out what, if anything, can be drawn from Deltec's brief and cryptic missive.  'Without any liability'  This sentence from the letter in particular raised eyebrows:  ""This letter is provided without any liability, however arising, on the part of Deltec Bank & Trust Limited, its officers, directors, employees and shareholders, and is solely based on the information currently in our possession.""  Preston Byrne, a technology consultant with Tomram LLC (and author of the marmot parody cited above), said that the disclaimer calls back to Hedley Byrne & Co. Ltd. v. Heller & Partners Ltd., a U.K. legal case from the 1960s.  In the case, the House of Lords ruled that a bank which made a similar disclaimer could not be held responsible for actions taken as a result of a letter it sent.  ""The Bahamas is a common law jurisdiction,"" which means it may ""give persuasive weight to English precedent,"" Byrne explained, adding:  ""Hedley Byrne is an English case concerning the inadvertent assumption of liability by a bank to a third party as a result of public statements made by the bank to a third party, and the effectiveness of a disclaimer in discharging any obligations that bank might owe to that third party as a result of those statements.""  In other words, there is case law precedent for what one entity might owe another.  ""Is the case relevant? To an extent, but the bank does not have a fiduciary relationship with anyone but Tether,"" said Matthew Gertler, an attorney who recently joined Reserve, the issuer of a rival stablecoin.  While Tether's decision to publish the letter might indicate that it's for public consumption, then, readers should not assume they've been given any sort of legally meaningful guarantee of anything, since they're extraneous to the Deltec-Tether relationship.  Love, Anon  Speculation also centered on that fact that there is no person's name attached to the letter, and that the signature is just a curve.  But Gertler argued that the lack of a name or legible signature is not necessarily an issue.  ""Certain people at companies are able to write letters on behalf of the company,"" he continued. ""The signee is merely someone who has authority to write these letters on behalf of the bank. I do not see this as unusual,"" he explained.  The attorneys CoinDesk spoke to also stressed the importance, from a legal perspective, of the letter's intended audience, who likely did not require an individual's name.  ""The letter is written to Tether for Tether,"" Gertler said. ""The bank is basically saying that if it is wrong and Tether suffers a loss, Tether cannot sue the bank. I should note that anyone else who relies on the bank letter cannot go after the bank because the letter is for Tether and no one else.""  The language of the letter covers it ""in case there was a system or other error that caused the amount to be misstated,"" he said, adding,  ""This is lawyers doing what lawyers do.""  'Portfolio cash value'  Another focus of social media exegesis was the phrase ""portfolio cash value."" To some, that appeared to an artful way of saying that the firm is not strictly complying with the language in its white paper, which says:  ""Each tether unit issued into circulation is backed in a one­-to­-one ratio (i.e. one Tether USDT is one US dollar) by the corresponding fiat currency unit held in deposit by Hong Kong based Tether Limited.""  (It did not escape notice that the letter was addressed to an office in Taiwan, not Hong Kong.)  As one user pointed out, ""portfolio cash value"" potentially leaves room for assets that aren't U.S. dollars – perhaps even cryptocurrencies.  An attorney who spoke to CoinDesk on condition of anonymity, citing ""onslaughts of spam and other negative reactions"" suffered by those who criticize Tether publicly, addressed this point:  ""Regardless of whether I'm a purchaser or investor, who in their right mind would rely on this letter anyway? […] What people want to know when they buy tether is 'are there dollars on deposit,' and this doesn't say anything about that. It says it has $1.8 billion in its account but it doesn't have to be in cash. It says 'portfolio cash value.' I don't know what that means.""  The balance could even ""be money that was loaned to tether for a day,"" the attorney added.  Gertler proposed a more generous interpretation. ""More likely, the portfolio is of various fiat currencies or various different bank accounts,"" he said. ""If it is only USD, the bank letter is probably a form letter that contemplates various fiats and bank accounts.""  Caveat auditor  Stepping back, as the reigning stablecoin, USDT plays a critical role in the crypto ecosystem, allowing traders to quickly transfer value between exchanges without relying on the traditional banking system.  But Tether has not yet produced a full audit of its bank balances, despite language in the white paper saying, ""the corresponding total amount of USD held in our reserves is proved by publishing the bank balance and undergoing periodic audits by professionals.""  An analysis by Friedman LLP issued in September 2017 indicated that Tether had funds in at least U.S. dollars and euros at the time. Friedman was supposed to complete a full audit, but Tether said in January that its relationship with the firm had ""dissolved.""  Tether subsequently obtained a report from the law firm Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan, LLP, which said that USDT issuance was fully backed by bank deposits as of June 1, though like the Friedman report and the Deltec letter it was rife with qualifications.  From that time until Thursday – nearly five months – Tether provided no evidence that it held a dollar in bank deposits for every tether in circulation. During the month of October, the market capitalization of tether fell by nearly 40 percent to $1.74 billion, according to CoinMarketCap, reflecting a steep decline in total supply as Bitfinex – an exchange that shares common ownership and management with the company – sent hundreds of millions of tokens to a Tether-controlled wallet known as the ""treasury.""  The declining market cap also partially reflects a fall in tether's price, which has rarely reached its $1.00 target in the past month, and is currently at $0.97997, according to CoinMarketCap.  Whatever your interpretation of the Deltec letter, it clearly has not put doubts to rest.

42429906,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM26th,1541176220,Israeli Startups Raised $600 Million Through ICOs in 2018: Report,"Israeli startups have brought in more than $600 million in funding from initial coin offerings (ICOs) in the first three quarters of 2018, according to an industry report.  Crypto analytics and research firm One Alpha surveyed ICOs and blockchain projects globally, from the past year, aiming to provide an overview on the status of the blockchain and ICO ecosystem, with a particular focus on Israel.  One Alpha's survey counted 140 active blockchain-related companies in Israel, which, when combined with other forms of investment, have received $1.3 billion worth of investments. ""More than 60% of the companies and 88% of the funds are ICO-related,"" the report noted.  Further, the token sale figures surpass the funds raised for industry startups through traditional angel and seed venture capital investments for that period as well.  The $600 million figure represents an increase over 2017's numbers, in line with the overall jump in ICO growth seen this year. But it wasn't a huge leap for Israel-specific ICOs, with One Alpha finding that firms in the country raised $586 million in total during 2017 between less than 20 token sales.  Yaniv Feldman, CEO of One Alpha, told CoinDesk, said the figures speak to the strength of the blockchain ecosystem in Israel more broadly.  ""Israelis are less than 0.1 percent of global population while making 3 to 5 percent of global ICO fundraising amount is definitely something that shows that Israel is one of the most important in terms of blockchain innovation,"" he said.  As previously reported, 2018 saw Israeli regulators clarifying their positions on matters related to cryptocurrency in blockchain. For example, back in March, the Israel Securities Authority recommended regulations that sought to differentiate so-called utility tokens from crypto-assets that are considered securities, a move that came several months after officials released a draft plan for the taxation of ICOs in January.  Looking to the future, Feldman remarked that Israel isn't interested in being overly crypto-friendly, compared to jurisdictions like Malta or Gibraltar. He contended that Israel would rather regulate the industry in such a way that uplifts local businesses, adding that the nation is specifically looking to U.S. regulators as an example.

At least three of these sales reportedly raised more than a combined $68 million from investors before being shut down, the agency said in its annual report Friday.  To be sure, that's just a sliver of the more than $3.945 billion in disgorgement and penalties the SEC collected during fiscal 2018. But the increase in enforcement actions surrounding initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other crypto-related startups was significant.  ""Given the explosion of ICOs over the last year, we have tried to pursue cases that deliver broad messages and have market impact beyond their own four corners,"" the report stated.  In the report, the SEC Division of Enforcement noted that its new Cyber Unit, formed at the end of the 2017 fiscal year, has helped it expand its focus on cyber-related misconduct. As a result, ""the SEC's enforcement efforts impacted a number of areas where the federal securities laws intersect with cyber issues,"" this year.  To that end, ""the Commission brought 20 stand alone cases, including those cases involving ICOs and digital assets,"" it reported. By the end of the fiscal year, ""the Division had more than 225 cyber-related investigations ongoing.""  Nor are those the only cases the SEC brought this year. Further in the report, it added:  ""While many of these cases have involved allegations of fraud, the Division also has pursued enforcement actions to ensure compliance with the registration requirements of the federal securities laws. In the past year, the Division has opened dozens of investigations involving ICOs and digital assets, many of which were ongoing at the close of FY 2018.""

42429905,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM26rh,1541163683,Cboe's Head of Equity Options Just Joined a Blockchain Startup,"Blockchain startup AlphaPoint has hired a senior executive from Cboe Global Markets, the parent of the Chicago Board of Exchange.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Kapil Rathi joined AlphaPoint as global head of trading markets, a newly created position, and will be in charge of the company's trading and exchange business. He was previously Cboe's head of equity options, and earlier worked at the New York Stock Exchange, ISE (now a part of Nasdaq) and Bats Global Markets, which Cboe acquired in 2017.  Rathi told CoinDesk that he has been watching AlphaPoint for the last year and a half with interest and admired the progress it made helping institutions bring new products to market. At his new job, he will be looking to ""improve and bridge the collaboration between mainstream finance and the digital assets industry to build and grow the ecosystem,"" Rathi said by email.  Speaking to the state of such collaboration, Rathi added:  ""Digital assets and crypto are at an interesting crossroads. While the investor demand and appetite to participate in digital assets is exponentially increasing, the facilitators of capital markets like prime brokers, custodians, exchanges, and regulators are taking a slow and cautious approach.""  As such, he will draw on his experience building and running regulated exchanges ""to transform the digital assets industry into an established and viable alternative to other asset classes like equities, options, and fixed income,"" Rathi said. While developing new products, he will work with regulators and security exchanges and remain ""extremely cognizant of investors' protection and their rights.""  Igor Telyatnikov, AlphaPoint president and co-founder, said Rathi will be in good company, as the management team also includes veterans of such mainstream firms as Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, UBS, and Bloomberg.  ""It's also a true testament to how far we've come in the industry that a blockchain company like AlphaPoint can bring on someone like Kapil, who ran one of the largest equity options exchanges in the world – this is extremely notable,"" Telyatnikov told CoinDesk.  Crypto 'believer'  Indeed, Rathi has been vocally enthusiastic about crypto assets while working at Cboe.  In June he said during an interview with Options Insider: ""At Cboe, we are believers in the crypto space, we are not going to project whether bitcoin is going to be $20 or $200,00 dollars, but it's a tradable asset, and we are taking a holistic approach to that, whether it's adding new cryptocurrencies or crypto options — this is definitely something we at Cboe are looking at.""  Bitcoin futures trading at Cboe, launched in December 2017, reached a peak on April 26, when 18,210 contacts for the May futures were traded. The Chicago exchange has also been actively advocating for the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, writing a letter to SEC in March and meeting with new commissioner Elad Roisman to discuss the issue in October.  Rathi has a record of moving things forward with innovations at the places he worked for. He helped automate trading on the NYSE floor, oversaw the development of Bats' EDGX exchange after the launch and the integration of Bats' technology with Cboe's after the acquisition.  In May, AlphaPoint launched its Regulated Asset-Backed Token (RABT) framework at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference in New York City and said it had developed software that allows trading of the token while ensuring compliance with securities laws.  Over the summer, the startup raised $15 million through Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital and launched a decentralized exchange named DCEX that uses XRP as its main currency against which others are traded.

Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, imToken said on Friday that the firm has independently built what it calls a ""universal hardware solution"" that will link up with cold wallet devices made by Ledger and the Taiwan-based CoolBitX – a firm partially owned by Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings.  Ben He, founder and CEO of imToken, said the aim is to bridge the gap between software- and hardware-based wallet services and ultimately help enable wider adoption of cryptocurrencies.  Hardware wallets store crypo assets in an offline environment to keep them safe from hackers. Currently, in order to make transactions, hardware wallet users must generally access their digital assets using a desktop client connected over USB.  ""While cold wallets are the best option for maintaining private keys, they still have a low adoption rate. But we want to bring that hardware security to hot wallet users and ultimately change their perception about what's most secure in the crypto world, but at the same time allowing them to manage their assets with liquidity,"" he said.  For instance, He added, with the new imToken solution, Ledger and Coolwallet users could still maintain their private keys offline, but still directly initiate bitcoin, ethereum and EOS transactions for trading or participation in decentralized applications supported inside the mobile app.  However, the CEO said that compatibility between the wallets is achieved via Bluetooth. The integrations with CoolBitX's Coolwallet S and Ledger's Blue – both Bluetooth-enabled devices – are expected to formally go live by December this year, and in Q1 2019, respectively.  While that means the solution will not support Ledger's USB-only devices, like the Nano wallet, it would be able to integrate with future products if they add Bluetooth connectivity.  The news follows a recent report that Ledger is expanding to Asian markets with the appointment of capital market veteran Benjamin Soong. The company said 30 percent of its device sales now come from Asian markets.  When asked about the pending integration, Ledger told CoinDesk: ""Ledger supports this move like any integration done using our platform. We're an open platform and we'll publish anything that follows our app integration guidelines.""  ImToken, founded in 2016, has grown into one of the largest ethereum wallet services with around 7 million users – 75 percent of whom come from its home market, China. The startup claims it currently handles about 10 percent of all daily ethereum transactions.  In June, imToken raised $10 million in a Series A funding round fully backed by investment firm IDG Capital.  Also announced today, Beijing-based wallet hardware maker imKey – in which imToken's venture arm has a stake – is to roll out a new hardware wallet called imKey, with pre-orders to start by the end of this year.

42429896,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM26dh,1541158231,Winklevoss Brothers Sue Charlie Shrem Over $32 Million in Bitcoin,"Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are reportedly suing early bitcoin investor and entrepreneur Charlie Shrem over thousands of bitcoin they allege he owes them from a previous business deal.  According to a report from The New York Times on Thursday, Shrem – who previously spent a year in prison for money laundering and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business related to the BitInstant exchange that he founded – had helped the Winklevoss brothers invest in bitcoin back in 2012.  Acting as their first crypto adviser, Shrem had accepted $750,000 to buy bitcoin on their behalf, according to the NYT citing a lawsuit launched by the twins in September and unveiled today. Later, in September 2012, they gave him $250,000 for the same purpose, the lawsuit alleges, but later realized that Shrem had not given them the full value of the amount in bitcoin.  They now claiming to be short by roughly 5,000 bitcoin, worth almost $32 million at today's prices. At the time of the deal in 2012, one bitcoin was worth approximately $12.50.  The Winklevoss brothers claim they appealed to Shrem for the cryptocurrency they say they were due, but that it was not forthcoming. Specifically, the lawsuit claims that extravagant purchases Shrem has made since leaving jail two years ago – despite having previously said he had almost no money at the time of serving the sentence – including two Maserati sports cars, two powerboats and a $2 million property in Florida, are likely being funded by the alleged misappropriated cryptocurrency.  ""Either Shrem has been incredibly lucky and successful since leaving prison, or – more likely – he 'acquired' his six properties, two Maseratis, two powerboats and other holdings with the appreciated value of the 5,000 Bitcoin he stole ..."" the lawsuit states, according to the NYT.  Shrem has now had some assets frozen by the judge presiding in his previous trial, according to the court documents.  In a statement reported in the NYT, Shrem's lawyer, Brian Klein, said:  ""The lawsuit erroneously alleges that about six years ago Charlie essentially misappropriated thousands of Bitcoins. Nothing could be further from the truth. Charlie plans to vigorously defend himself and quickly clear his name.""  Shrem started his ordered two year prison term in March 2015, though ultimately only served one year.  The CEO of now-defunct bitcoin exchange BitInstant, Shrem had previously been found to have violated anti-money laundering rules by dealing with a customer who supplied $1 million in bitcoin to people buying drugs on the online marketplace Silk Road.  Shrem entered a plea bargain in court, agreeing to forfeit $950,000 to the U.S. government as a condition of compliance with the deal.  The latter agreement may come back to haunt Shrem, according to the NYT, which says that an affidavit filed in court indicates that Shrem did not pay the $950,000 to the government.

42429916,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM27Bh,1541156404,Bitcoin Sees New Price Support From 7-Year-Long Rising Trendline,"With the number of strong support levels increasing for bitcoin (BTC), the bitcoin bears are facing an uphill battle.  The latest addition to the list is the support of the trendline connecting the November 2011 and August 2016 lows, currently at $5,830. Up to Oct. 31, the two key support levels were the 21-month EMA and the trendline drawn between the June and August lows.  In particular, the 21-month EMA was the level to beat for the bears till last month, meaning a close below that support would likely have revived the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 seen last December.  While the 21-month EMA still remains a crucial support, the new make-or-break level is the seven-year-long rising trendline.  That's because the trendline support, which was located around $5,300 last month, has now moved closer to the current price and is seen rising above $6,300 in December. Hence, it may now be incorrect to call a break below the 21-month EMA a sign of a bear revival.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,330 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.5 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Monthly chart  On the monthly chart, a break below the trendline support of $5,830 would strengthen the bear grip and allow a drop to the psychological support of $5,000.  The bulls, however, would feel emboldened if the cryptocurrency produces a strong bounce off that key support.  As for the next 24 hours, investors should keep an eye on the symmetrical triangle seen in the chart below.  Daily Chart  The upper edge of the symmetrical triangle, currently at $6,400, is proving a tough nut to crack on the daily chart. A break above that level would put the bulls in a commanding position, opening the doors for a rally to $6,756 (Oct. 15 high).  View  The 7-year-long-rising trendline is the new level to beat for the bears.  A symmetrical triangle breakout, if confirmed, could yield a re-test of Oct. 15 highs above $6,750. On the other hand, a downside break would expose the Oct. 11 low of $6,055.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42421798,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXt8yT,1541145652,"The Incoming Wave of ICO Regulation (Yes, It's Coming)","Alex Sunnarborg is a Founder of Tetras Capital. Previously, he was a research analyst at CoinDesk and a founder of the crypto investing app Lawnmower.     As you may know, securities classification analysis in the U.S. today primarily revolves around the Securities Act of 1933 and the SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. Supreme Court case of 1946.  The Securities Act of 1933 was established to require issuers to disclose certain pieces of information to potential investors prior to any public securities offering. This law was enacted to reduce misrepresentation by issuers and to help protect investors, but applies only to the sale of ""securities.""  In 1946, SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. broadened the definition of securities by including any ""investment contract"", defined as: (1) an investment of money (2) into a common enterprise (3) with the expectation of profit (4) to come solely from the efforts of others.  This criteria has come to be known as the ""Howey Test,"" and has now been used to evaluate a wide variety of investment schemes. Howey's own securities sales involved selling real estate and service contracts for citrus groves he owned in Florida.  Combining these two pieces of regulation, the registration requirements defined by The Securities Act of 1933 must be satisfied prior to the sale of any investment contract as defined per the Howey Test of 1946.  71 years after the citrus groves, the SEC used the Howey Test to determine that the tokens sold in The DAO ICO were securities.  Participants in The DAO invested money: ETH (defined as a ""virtual currency"" like BTC)  into a common enterprise: The DAO  with an expectation of profit: DAO (tokens purchased in the ICO)  deriving from the efforts of management: Slock.it, the project's founders, and The DAO's curators.  Thus:  DAO tokens were securities.  The DAO ICO was an unregistered securities offering.  Instead of levying action against management, the SEC did not pursue charges.  The ICO boom  At the time of the SEC's DAO report in July 2017, global token sale fundraising had just crossed $2 billion. Rather than cool the market down, in the next 12 months ICOs boomed and issuers raised over $20 billion (over 10 times the all-time total in just one year).  Almost none of these ICOs were registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933.  Moving forward to today, not much has changed. ICOs have not stopped and large rounds continue to be raised both publicly and privately.  Aside from the uncertain regulatory risk, an ICO is nearly a no-brainer for capital hungry entrepreneurs. ICOs have long since trumped VC as the preferred method of raising capital. Why would you bother pitching a critical VC firm when you can collect capital directly from anyone in the world?  Who's still investing though? Despite many altcoin prices being down 90 percent or more this year, and much of retail feeling exhausted, many venture-style crypto funds were still raised in the last 12 months and thus are nearly forced to make large bets in new early stage deals.  The resulting pool of ICO risk  What's done is done at this point for the majority of ICOs. Assets that were created as a result of an ICO and those involved in the issuance process can not take that ICO back. Token sales now date back five-plus years and the money involved has now dissipated through the world.  Many of the largest ICOs and crypto assets presently hold substantial risk as the following questions remain unanswered:  Is the crypto asset a security now?  Was the crypto asset a security during the initial or any subsequent sale?  If not, did an exemption apply or was it an unregistered securities sale?  Is U.S. securities law even relevant?  The SEC highlighted three key parties at risk of future action:  Issuers of unregistered securities offerings.  Investors in unregistered deals.  Exchanges facilitating unregistered securities trading.  Regulatory action against any of these parties would likely result in selling and negative pressure on the underlying asset's price. An action against exchanges would also likely coincide with a decrease in liquidity. Not only could exchanges be liable for previously facilitating the exchange of securities without necessary licensing, but in the event the exchange was currently listing the asset for trading and needed to delist the asset, overall market liquidity could drop severely.  Many crypto assets trade on only one or very few exchanges and thus an exchange delisting can suffocate liquidity and price. In addition to bad PR, the diminished liquidity would likely make it more difficult for new capital to buy in the future due to decreased on-ramp options. Further, other exchanges without securities trading licenses may also immediately follow suit and delist the asset to reduce regulatory risk and scrutiny, further centralizing liquidity.  The DAO ICO illustrates a clear situation where:  An issuer sold unregistered securities to unaccredited investors in the U.S.  Both global retail and sophisticated institutional investors invested (many also leading the development of both The DAO and ethereum).  Several exchanges (with users including unaccredited investors in the U.S.) facilitated the unregistered exchange of unregistered securities.  In their conclusion that DAO tokens were securities, the SEC took no enforcement action against the ICO issuer. Similarly, no investors or exchanges have been charged.  Many relative high profile ICOs are in a similar situation.  In June 2018, SEC director William Hinman stated ""putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions (as with Bitcoin)"".  This statement. I believe, illustrates a few things:  Hinman does not believe bitcoin and ether are currently securities due to their ""decentralized structures"". (I would love to see more of his analysis.)  Hinman purposefully ""put aside"" ether's ICO and likely believes ether may have been a security at the time of the initial offer. (Presumably because he believes ether was more centralized at the time.)  Hinman likely believes that ether became decentralized enough to lose its securities classification at some point. Thus, he likely believes that the ether ICO was a securities offering and perhaps some exchanges were facilitating securities trading at some point in time. (I would love to see his analysis on when ether changed to decentralized.)  SEC staff can make relatively bold statements in public. Statements from SEC staff are not the same as official reports from the SEC. Hinman speaking at a public Yahoo Finance conference is not the same as a report from the full SEC (but many could perceive it as such).  If Hinman thinks like his colleagues though, ethereum's ICO may very likely be seen as an unregistered securities offering.  If ethereum's ICO was an unregistered securities offering, the list of ERC20 ICOs and tokens built upon its blockchain looks something like a minefield on top of a house of cards. Not only are the majority of these ICOs likely unregistered securities offerings, but many of them have likely not cleared the bar of becoming decentralized that Hinman believes ether did.  Thus these assets not only had unregistered securities offerings in the past, but they are also currently securities. These token projects are not only at risk of enforcement against the issuer, but also most heavily at risk of a sharp drop in liquidity due to action towards exchanges without securities trading licenses and the subsequent delistings.  If my conclusions are correct, the SEC's wrath has not yet passed. Rather, I believe the SEC is simply taking its time in organizing the facts and appropriate actions towards hundreds of ICO issuers, investors and exchanges.  The wave is building and I believe action is coming. The current list of enforcements in 2018 may be minuscule to what it will look like in a few years.  It is clear that many ICO issuers as well as the investors and exchanges that traded the tokens have taken some questionable actions. However to be fair to entrepreneurs, regulatory guidance has been extremely minimal and trying to navigate the industry generally feels like you're wearing a blindfold.  In the long term, more regulation should lead to a higher quality marketplace for entrepreneurs and investors, and a better reputation for the eventual end user and industry as a whole.  In the short and medium term, though, we should be in for an interesting ride of regulatory action around ICOs.  Investing and avoiding regulatory risk  Investing in the crypto asset class is obviously extremely risky. Diversification within the asset class is somewhat of a myth. Liquid crypto asset price movements are highly correlated and many early stage crypto investments share exposure to (1) risk around securities regulation and (2) ethereum as its base blockchain.  Bitcoin leads the crypto asset class in terms of market cap, liquidity, age and security. I thus believe bitcoin should be most long crypto investor's primary benchmark, and any alternative crypto investment should be analyzed as to the opportunity cost vs holding BTC. In modeling out various scenarios, one of the greatest weaknesses of many alternative crypto assets is the uncertainty around future liquidity.  If you invest in a very early stage deal, before even the ICO (in a pre-ICO, SAFT, or similar round), the journey to liquidity may entail:  Waiting for the team to build initial software.  Waiting for the team to decide on a public offering or token distribution strategy.  Waiting for the team to distribute you tokens after any vesting or lock-up period.  Waiting for an exchange or similar liquidity avenue to open a market you can sell on.  In addition to that daunting gauntlet of hurdles, at any point during this journey or after, regulatory risk can persist. The token can be deemed to have been a security when it was sold without proper registrations in the past, likely severely harming its liquidity.  When investing in any early stage deal, you need to be (1) very confident on your early stage deal's estimated timeline to liquidity, and/or (2) confident that it can outperform BTC on any time horizon (as BTC will be liquid on all timeframes).  A VC portfolio can have many strikeouts that one home run like ETH can make up for, but I do believe many (especially institutional) crypto investors make the mistake of over-allocating to illiquid positions.  On recent time scales the ROI of ICOs vs liquid asset alternatives just doesn't make sense unless you are extremely lucky or diligent and active with your ICO selection and trading. The lack of liquidity means that early stage investments that are going poorly are unable to be sold, leading to retaining underperforming regulatory risky and correlated positions. In my opinion, the benefits of the ability to actively re-balance a crypto asset portfolio cannot be overstated (2017–2018 alone should be proof of the advantages of liquidity alone).  Outside of early stage illiquid deals, I generally group liquid asset ICO regulation exposure in three buckets:  Least risky: asset has had no sales (no ICO, etc.) – e.g., BTC, XMR, DCR  More risky: asset had a private ICO or sales (restricted to institutions, accredited investors, etc. only) – e.g., FIL, ZEC, XRP  Most risky: asset had a public ICO (totally open to anyone in the world) – e.g., ETH, EOS, SNT  To minimize risk to future securities regulation, minimize overall exposure to early stage illiquid deals without clear registration and liquid assets in bucket 3.  The SEC has not forgotten or overlooked any deal, the wave of ICO regulatory action is coming.

42429899,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM26jh,1541132413,Apps for Kik's Crypto Are Beginning to Appear on Apple and Google Stores,"The number of mobile apps built around kin – the cryptocurrency created and launched by mobile messaging app Kik – is growing.  As of this writing, ten are already out, and more will become available as the Google Play and iOS stores move to approve them. All told, more than thirty apps are expected to debut in the coming weeks.  A quick summary: kin was created by the Canadian messaging app company Kik. To help bootstrap the project, Kik raised $98 million in one of 2017's biggest initial coin offerings (ICOs). And this summer, it announced it would support teams that are building apps that are designed to enable users to use – and earn – its token.  ""We're trying to build an ecosystem where you can earn kin in one application and spend it in another,"" Ayelet Laub, a product manager working on the Kin Ecosystem told CoinDesk.  Lots of the apps coming out fall in the classic categories with which mobile users will be most familiar. And while this offers the advantage of familiarity, it carries the disadvantage of having to compete in a market crowded by big incumbents.  Fortunately, these apps don't have to compete solely on cool factor and user experience like most do, as the new kin-enabled apps pay users directly for their participation. Put another way, think of kin as the means by which users are incentivized to fire up the apps and participate.  The following apps are currently live on Google Play: Reveald (dating), Kinguist (language learning), Nearby (networking), GoChallenge.me (social goals), AddMe (business networking), Find (travel networking), Vent (mental health) and Kinny (social tipping). Two apps are available so far on iOS so far: Blastchat (instant messaging) and Pause For (productivity).  All of these apps have straightforward ways to earn and spend kin, as required by the developer program.  Stepping back, more than 200 teams applied to join the program. Forty were ultimately chosen, and in the end, 32 made it far enough in the developer program to submit their apps to either the Google Play or iOS stores. Supporting them were development grants that included kin allocations to be used to attract would-be users.  Ted Livingston, Kik's founder, has repeatedly said he wants kin to become the most used cryptocurrency on earth where it's easy for internet users to both earn it and spend it. The theory here is that if very small amounts of money can be traded easily and freely online, many more people will spend much more money overall.  Kin was originally created for ethereum, but it has since ported most of its functionality over to a fork of the Stellar blockchain, because Kik wanted to be able to process loads of transactions for free. That way, kin could run in lots and lots of mobile apps at once.  A key component to come  All of the apps can be said to aim at a common goal: to see if cryptocurrencies can improve traditional mobile uses cases, whether it's a dating or task-tracking apps.  For example, BlastChat – the only app this reporter has thus far tested on the iOS platform (it's also available for Android) – is a social network that's less about accruing followers and more about making user-friendly broadcasts. Users can give one another kin for good posts, as well as earn kin for posting to the main channels that all users can see.  To promote participation, BlastChat hands users a little over 100 kin to start, setting them up to earn more. But at this stage, there aren't enough people using it yet to quickly give even 100 kin away at 1 kin per tip.  But there's a big update waiting to be made for all of these apps: it's currently not possible to deposit or withdraw kin.  ""The app needs to reveal the user's public wallet address. We need to figure out how to do it in the easiest way and most user-friendly way,"" Laub said.  Kin's developers are working on that. Once they have a solution they believe works, they'll then approach the mobile app teams and recommend its adoption.  What's more, the apps being built around kin have taken what could be called an atypical path compared to other decentralized apps seen on the market today, wherein most ask users to connect with their own wallets. So far, kin apps seem to be turning that approach on its head, with each app generating a fresh wallet for each user.  Laub said that Kin Ecosystem has tried not to be prescriptive – but it does have opinions on some points. For example, the KDP team encouraged apps to avoid in-app purchases in favor of person-to-person exchanges, but many of the teams participating want them.  This may explain why only five of the apps are leading with iOS launches. Apple has not been supportive of buying crypto.  What's more, startups need a revenue stream in order to thrive. Kin itself was built to provide that directly with daily payouts from the Kin Rewards Engine (KRE). Each day, the KRE would pay every kin-powered app based on its proportion of the day's economic activity.  That way, developers didn't need to directly earn crypto from users – but the KRE is not live yet.
