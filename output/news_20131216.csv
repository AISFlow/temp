42422953,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yuvh,1387220442,Merge Avoidance: Privacy Enhancing Techniques in the Bitcoin Protocol,"Mike Hearn is a software developer who works on the Bitcoin Core development team and also at Google. In this article, Mike discusses some bitcoin privacy leaks, and a new technique that does not currently have a name, but which he calls merge avoidance.  Introduction to bitcoin privacy  It's an unfortunate fact that, despite bitcoin’s reputation in the press, its users currently leak large amounts of personal information.  It is distressingly easy for someone to learn about your balance, trading history and more. Protecting this information is a basic function of any useful financial system.  Here are a handful of leaks that crop up in daily usage.  Address reuse  Many privacy problems in Bitcoin are caused by an adversary learning which outputs are owned by the same wallet. If you can calculate this, you can discover the wallets balance and possibly who it traded with.  The most common way this happens is when addresses are reused. This is easily understood because popular sites like blockchain.info index outputs and transactions by address, allowing you to quickly look up all the transactions that reference any given address.  Address reuse has many different root causes. Here are a sampling:  1. End-user wallet problems  The bitcoinj library always reuses addresses by policy, thus leaking a lot of private information. There are two reasons for this. One is that prior to the development of HD wallets, constantly using up keys would result in invalidation of old wallet backups.  Bitcoin-Qt has a “key pool” to try and address this, but it only puts the problem off: the key pool can be silently exhausted giving the same problem. Invalidating backups can cause people to lose money.  Once HD wallets are implemented (which is in progress) this problem will go away, leaving only the second problem of memory pressure on low end phones. Address re-use may still be required on such devices, but higher end phones and desktops/laptops shouldn’t encounter any issues.  2. Server wallet problems  There are no public, open-source wallet implementations that scale to wallets with very large numbers of keys. As far as I know, exchanges and major payment processors have all had to implement lots of custom code to work around the lack of scalability of Bitcoin-Qt (and bitcoinj).  This puts pressure on receivers to reuse addresses.  3. Social conventions  People putting static addresses into forum signatures, QR codes, etc.  Over time, we will need to make progress with all these issues to reduce address reuse. HD wallets and the payment protocol are important tools to help us achieve this.  Change outputs  One of the most irritating privacy leaks in Bitcoin is people learning lower bounds on your balance.  How this works can be understood intuitively via the analogy of cash. With paper money, if you hand over a 500 CHF note to pay for a drink costing only 5 CHF, the bar tender learns that your balance is at least 495 CHF. It may well be higher of course, but it’s at least not lower. Bitcoin has the same issue.  The root cause of this problem is a mismatch between the size of a payment you wish to make and the coins (outputs) available to you.  If the mismatch is in one direction, you have a lot of tiny outputs and making payments for any non-tiny amounts starts to cost a lot in fees, because the transactions you generate are huge.  If the mismatch is in the other direction then to pay for a small thing requires the usage of a big coin, and the change output leaks valuable data about how rich you are.  Network traffic  Bitcoin P2P connections are unencrypted. One reason is that most of the data flowing across the P2P network is public, thus encrypting it seems pointless.  Another reason is that by its very nature, when you connect to a P2P network your peers could be absolutely anyone and do absolutely anything – for instance they could be nodes run by the NSA.  And that’s not even a bad thing! Why shouldn't the NSA run nodes? If someone were to tell them not to, that would imply some kind of central authority who was dictating who gets to run Bitcoin and who doesn’t. We don’t want that.  So encrypting data is useful when you have a clear idea of who should see it and who shouldn’t. Encrypting public data to random people whom you know nothing about – not quite so useful.  Despite all that, there are still four reasons why it would help to encrypt connections.  The first reason is for Bloom filters.  These are compact representations of what’s relevant to your wallet: typically, what addresses/keys are in it. A filter is one way and can be noisy, that is, you can’t read out addresses directly from a filter, you can only apply it to the block chain and see what it matches.  Filters can have false positives, so a node can never be sure if an address is really yours or not. That’s pretty good, but even with a high false positive rate it still narrows down what coins you might own pretty massively.  Bloom filters are not public information, they’re just shared between a client and the node it connects to. So it would be good to hide those against passive eavesdroppers, like people sharing your wifi hotspot.  The second reason is that even though transactions are public, their origin IP address is not (or it’s not supposed to be).  But an adversary who can observe lots of internet links could fairly reliably decide where a transaction started by precisely recording the times when a transaction was first seen and examining the first moment it transited a fibre link.  It seems like some intelligence agencies could do this kind of analysis. Encrypting links doesn’t guarantee a fix for this because timing analysis may still be possible, but it certainly makes it harder.  The third reason is that if encryption was combined with “trust on first use” (TOFU) authentication, it would make it harder even for active MITMs to perform sybil attacks on wallets and feed them bad data.  This is more important for SPV clients than full nodes, but both could benefit.  The final reason is that properly implemented, using SSL for P2P connections would make them harder to identify and block using deep packet inspection devices.  CoinJoin  Of all the problems above, the solution to leaking data via change outputs is one of the most hotly debated (although a lot of people don’t realise they’re debating it).  The CoinJoin proposal has received a lot of attention and some initial implementations. Some people see this primarily as a privacy tool, and others as a way to try and break coin tracing.  When used for privacy, it can best be described as a way to try and delete information that has already been leaked.  However, CoinJoin has a number of serious problems that make an alternative desirable.  It is deeply complex to implement well, vulnerable to sybil/DoS attacks (they’re often the same thing in this context), legally questionable and it’s not clear that the obfuscation even works.  The Sheep Marketplace theft has seen someone claim to trace coins through tumblers and mixers, and apparently with a modicum of success. One of the tracer’s tools was sybil/DoS attacks on mixing services so those are not a theoretical concern.  Whilst toy implementations are not too hard to put together, robust real-world implementations with proper timeout handling, security checks, good wallet UI integration etc are a lot more effort.  So far only blockchain.info has managed to create one (at sharedcoin.com), and you just have to trust that it doesn’t keep logs. Otherwise anyone with the logs could unmix.  Perhaps the least-discussed issue is user experience.  A CoinJoin transaction requires other people to take part. The more people who take part, the better. However, Bitcoin only peaks currently at about one transaction per second.  Even if all transactions were CoinJoined, and all rendezvoused at a single point (ack, centralisation!), you would still have to wait 10-15 seconds to get a good set of participants to mix with.  That’s just to start the protocol. Then those participants would all have to retrieve the candidate transaction and sign. If any time out, the whole thing has to start again.  In poor conditions it could easily take a minute or more to complete this process, especially if some participants have flaky networks (ie phones) and are using Tor. Given that we’re trying to improve performance rather than reduce it, that seems like a big problem all by itself.  Whilst increasing traffic and usage would help reduce this issue, even if traffic doubled, splitting the single central rendezvous point would immediately put waiting times back to square one.  You might solve this problem by doing CoinJoins in the background, unrelated to an actual spend that’s taking place.  That solves the problem of waiting in line at the coffee shop, but then fees must be paid on those transactions, and it may be difficult to explain to people why their balance suddenly dropped overnight due to an unexpected privacy tax.  That sort of nasty surprise would make bitcoin rather unappealing to ordinary users. It also raises the question of when and how often it is done.  Merge avoidance  As a common root cause of privacy leaks is a mismatch in the sizes of available coins vs what is required, it seems we could approach the problem from another angle: by avoiding creating any information leaks that need to be erased in the first place.  Consider the case of Alice, a coffee shop worker who gets paid a salary.  Alice does a great job and her boss recognizes that with a higher-than-normal pay packet.  Her co-worker Bob suspects he doesn’t get paid as much as Alice and wants to know, so convinces Alice to make a small payment to him just after pay day (perhaps they make a bet and Bob wins).  With regular Bitcoin, Alice’s wallet will probably use her salary output and the change will reveal what she gets paid. Even if she made several payments already, Bob can follow the chain of transactions backwards until he finds a reasonably round looking number on the right date and conclude that’s most likely her salary payment.  Plain CoinJoin also doesn’t help her. She would put in one large input to the mix, and get back one large output.  She could request lots of smaller outputs, but the input will still be salary-sized and on the right date. Unless lots of people who earn coffee-shop-sized salaries all happen to share the same CoinJoin transaction, the leak hasn’t been fixed.  What she really needs is to avoid ever having such a large-single output in the first place. Let’s call this merge avoidance.  When she submits her BIP 70 payment request to her employer, she requests a nice mix of denominations, just like as if she was buying cash at a foreign exchange desk.  The request also specifies a unique address for each output. The payment protocol does not specify how a wallet should satisfy this request, but it does allow the possibility that the senders wallet submits multiple independent transactions in order to satisfy the desired outputs.  [post-quote]  If her employer uses an old wallet that doesn’t understand merge avoidance, it will generate and submit to her a single giant transaction that has many inputs (from all the coffees) and all her requested outputs.  It will look much like a CoinJoin transaction would, but it only has a single participant. However, there is no way to know this from simply looking at the block chain.  If her employer uses a newer wallet that does understand merge avoidance, then something better happens — she will receive a number of different, smaller transactions, each one of which creates one or two of the outputs she requested.  There is nothing to link any of them together. Because she trusts her employer not to double spend, she can spread out the broadcast so not even timing gives them away.  If the selection of outputs is chosen smartly, she will never be in a situation whereby she has outputs awkwardly large or small for a particular payment. Bob will simply see a small transaction that yields a small change output, and no matter how far he traces back he will never find any salary-sized output. Alice wins!  Change outputs can leak data in another way. Bob failed in his attempt to learn Alice’s salary by tracing backwards through the block chain, but he can still watch the change output of the payment he received to see what happens to it.  If the change is later combined with many others to create a huge payment, suddenly he knows that Alice must have owned at least that much money.  Here CoinJoin seems like it should work – if the change goes into a mix, who can say who owns the outputs? But it’s fragile. Even if the outputs are randomly sized, in the absence of merge avoidance they will be recombined again to make a large payment.  If Alice happens to mention in passing that she’s going on holiday with her boyfriend, Bob can look at the outputs of the mix her change went into and wait for some of the outputs to be recombined.  If 1/3 of the outputs sit there unspent, 1/3 are spent without being combined in any significant way, and another 1/3 get combined into a $5,000 payment the evening before Alice mentions her holiday, it’s a pretty good bet that the trip is costing her $5,000.  Implementation properties  This scheme has several things that make it nice to implement:  It can be written incrementally – a simple and not very smart algorithm can nevertheless still improve someone’s privacy. Later, a better algorithm can be developed and deployed, but it doesn’t require any complicated global upgrades. This is a good fit for the volunteer driven fits-and-spurts, competing-wallets development model that Bitcoin has.  It is very simple and has no moving parts or big state machines. You don’t have to worry about a random mobile phone the other side of the world driving into a tunnel at the wrong moment, or running a buggy reimplementation of the software.  There is no centralisation, not even any transient rendezvous servers.  There are no legal risks, because you’re not relying on any services that could be considered money laundering tools.  It is robust. Above, I gave examples of how CoinJoin can appear to work, but still leak in the presence of very little additional information. Merge avoidance doesn’t have that problem.  There are also some downsides:  How good your privacy is depends heavily on how smartly the people sending you money craft transactions. Thus, your privacy relies on people who may not have much incentive to do anything about it. Hopefully common wallet software would do the right thing by default.  It increases the number of transactions, although the overhead is not as high as you might think – a transaction is merely a list of inputs, outputs and a two-field header (version and lock time). Inputs and outputs are not really changed over a good CoinJoin implementation, and version/locktime could easily be compressed/varint encoded to save space. The difference would be on the order of bytes rather than kilobytes.  It relies on the payment protocol. But many things rely on that, and the payment protocol is critical to crackdown on address reuse, which is needed for all proposed privacy schemes to work anyway. It’s important that we make BIP70 as easy and widespread as possible.  Merge avoidance doesn’t interfere with coin tracing. Some people may wish to implement CoinJoin systems for that reason alone.  However, I can’t imagine that becoming widespread. If people’s privacy is being protected via other means, then CoinJoin becomes a “help thieves hide their stolen money” system which reduces incentive to take part, increases legal risk even further and would make people wonder why their wallet apps were asking them to pay fees simply in order to shield people whom they most likely think are bad.  Besides, the Sheep Marketplace incident shows that decentralised crime fighting as a technique is sometimes the only option: nobody is going to ask the police to help recover their stolen drug money, and no government would bother helping if they did.

42376808,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eGEl,1387216843,"China Bans Payment Companies from Working With Bitcoin Exchanges, Sources Claim","UPDATE: CoinDesk can confirm that the source mentioned in this piece is Bobby Lee, CEO of bitcoin exchange BTC China. Lee said he is now happy to go on the record.  -----------------------------------------  Sources close to China's Central Bank today reported that the institution has banned third-party payment companies from doing business with bitcoin exchanges.  A reputable source told CoinDesk that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) met with most of the top third-party payment companies this morning.  The source said the meeting topic was unrelated to bitcoin, but digital currency became an important part of the discussion.  ""PBOC, in no uncertain terms, directed third-party payment companies not to do business with bitcoin exchanges in China,"" they explained.  At the moment, these claims are still rumours, as neither the PBOC nor any payment company has issued a statement to confirm what was discussed and what the outcome was. However, our source revealed they got their information from various channels, including those people who were at the meeting.  ""The writing's on the wall,"" said our source, adding:  ""Going forward, from this day, third-party payment companies will most likely sever their ties with bitcoin exchanges.""  They went on to say that if and when this happens, people will still be able to withdraw their money from Chinese exchanges, they just won't be able to deposit new funds.  ""There's no need to panic and do a run on the bank. People will still be able to sell their bitcoins for local currency and then withdraw that currency,"" they concluded.  Back on 5th December, the PBOC issued a statement saying that bitcoin was not a currency and, therefore, banks and other financial institutions were not allowed to deal with the digital currency.  The PBOC also said that merchants could no longer price their goods and services in bitcoin and couldn't exchange their wares for bitcoin.  The statement did, however, leave a few doors open for bitcoin. It essentially said bitcoin exchanges are legal, people have the right to buy and sell bitcoins, and bitcoin companies should register with the ministry of information and industrial technology.  This was good news for bitcoin exchanges in China as they were not only given some degree of legitimacy, but they were exclusively allowed to deal with digital currency while banks and financial institutions weren't allowed to touch them.  Unfortunately, this didn't last long.  On a potentially related note, several Chinese bitcoin exchanges, including BTC China, have just reintroduced trading commissions. A statement on BTC China's site reads:  Dear BTC China valued customer: To stabilize the recent turbulent Bitcoin market and minimize potential market manipulation, BTC China will end the 0% trading fee promotion, effective immediately, and revert to the 0.3% trading fee. We deeply apologize for the sudden change. BTC China, December 16, 2013  CoinDesk has contacted PBOC and Chinese payment service provider Tenpay for comment, but no responses had been received at the time of publication.

42376768,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eGL3,1387210257,Cameron Winklevoss Thinks Bitcoin Price Will Hit $40k,"The Winklevoss twins have both been very vocal in their support of bitcoin, which is understandable – given the fact they missed the opportunity to cash in on tech giant Facebook.  The brothers are avid bitcoin advocates, and big investors – with an estimated $35m worth of bitcoin between them.  Over the weekend, Cameron Winklevoss discussed the future of bitcoin on reddit, making a few interesting announcements and predictions.  Cameron’s ‘conservative’ valuation estimate sounds anything but – he believes each bitcoin will pass $40,000, roughly 40 times what a bitcoin is worth today.  He described his ‘small bull’ scenario to a reddit user who wondered how bitcoin would remain a viable currency:  “Small bull case scenario for Bitcoin is a 400bn USD market cap, so 40,000 USD a coin, but I believe it could be much larger. When this will happen, if it happens, I don't know, but if it happens, it will probably happen much faster than anyone imagines.”  This is not a new announcement, as the twins said the bitcoin market cap could hit $400bn back in November.  Another user remarked that Winklevoss stands to gain handsomely if the prediction pans out, questioning the credibility of his prediction. He added:  “I have put my money where my mouth is. I stand to gain as well as lose depending on how the future unfolds. Having skin in the game is called accountability. Bitcoin is way too large for one single person to be able to manipulate it by talking their book.”  'Commodity money'  When asked whether he sees bitcoin as a currency or a speculative vehicle, Cameron says he views bitcoin as commodity money. The reply came under a lot of scrutiny from other redditers who argued that Cameron’s position is vague at best, as bitcoin does not fit into existing definitions of what a currency should be.  He added that he views bitcoin as an alternative to fiat currencies rather than a replacement. Winklevoss also revealed that he did not make any altcoin investments yet.  ""I don't believe that any of the 'problems' or issues that they address can't be addressed by bitcoin itself.""  He also admitted that he does not look at the bitcoin price every day, as he is in bitcoin for the long-haul, adding: “Spartans hold.”  Winklevoss did not discuss the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, which the pair are setting up to help manage their bitcoin investments and give more legitimacy to bitcoin as an alternative currency.  He said he could not discuss the matter due to gun-jumping rules.  The twins filed for a $20m IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission back in July. The trust is sponsored by another company created by the twins, dubbed Math-Based Asset Services LLC.  At the time the brothers told the New York Times that they had roughly 1% of all bitcoins in circulation.

42376763,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eGHH,1387207211,SecondMarket’s Bitcoin Investment Trust Amasses $61.1 Million in 3 Months,"Almost three months have passed since SecondMarket launched the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT). How is it performing? Perhaps unsurprisingly (given bitcoin’s recent good fortune) not badly at all.  The BIT, launched as a vehicle for institutional investors to get into bitcoin, stood at a $61.1m (67,300 BTC) net asset value on Friday.  Shares in the Trust edged along for around two weeks after its inception on 26th September. Following this, they began creeping up, before beginning their meteoric rise around 4th November.  The net asset value (NAV) per share peaked a month later, before falling back. In short, the NAV of the BIT has tracked bitcoin’s own price movements very closely.  Barry Silbert, CEO at SecondMarket, said that performance has exceeded his expectations. The company’s initial goal was to hit $10m in asset centre management by the end of the year.  Five phases  Silbert describes himself as part of bitcoin’s second phase. The virtual currency will go through five phases, he says.  The first two-year phase was driven by hobbyist hackers, while the second, starting in 2011, bought in early adopters and entrepreneurs.  Phase three has just started, and it is bringing venture capital companies to the table. “VCs are now supporting and investing in a lot of companies that are building infrastructure on top of the protocol, which the average person is not going to see, for the foreseeable future,” Silbert says.  So what’s to come in stage four? According to Silbert, Wall Street.  Wall Street has been largely disinterested in bitcoin to date, but a significant portion of his investors still come from there. They’re individual professionals who are piling money into the BIT on their own behalf. Silbert said:  “It’s not the funds yet, it's the people who work there. So it's the portfolio managers, the traders, it's the bank executives who are investing personally.”  Wall Street professionals are ahead of their companies for several reasons.  It’s fair to say that some institutions don’t yet feel well informed about virtual currency, but it’s also because in many cases they aren’t allowed to be.  Bitcoin is not yet defined as an asset, a commodity, or a currency, Silbert points out (indeed, it has characteristics of them all). “A lot of these institutions just don’t have the ability within their structure to invest in that.”  The other problem is that the auditors aren’t equipped to deal with it. And the reason for that is down to one of bitcoin’s fundamental characteristics: addresses are anonymous.  Like anyone, an auditor can see that a certain address holds inputs of a certain value. But it can’t prove that an investor owns them. “Access does not equal ownership, so you cannot prove title,” Silbert says.  Nevertheless, he believes that the funds will solve these problems over time. After all, SecondMarket did. It enlisted Ernst & Young as its auditor, showing that large accounting firms are prepared to get involved.  Tech entrepreneurs  Wall Street professionals join another group of people who are blazing a trail in bitcoin by investing ahead of their own companies: technology entrepreneurs.  They are a natural fit, because they have a natural affinity with and understanding of technology. They ‘get’ virtual currency, and believe in its potential.  Individuals in this category can take advantage of self-directed Investment Retirement Accounts (IRAs), which are retirement investment accounts, generally held by a qualified custodian, in which the account’s owner makes the investment decisions.  “In the US it's very common for investors to use self-directed IRAs to do [activities] like angel investing, early-stage investing,” Silbert says.  Several of these IRAs - PENSCO, EnTrust, Equity Institutional, and Millennium Trust, are now listing the BIT as an investment option. But apparently, Fidelity Investments isn’t. Last week, CNBC and Marketwatch reported that the investment firm was allowing certain IRA clients to invest in bitcoin, but it subsequently changed its mind. ”  SecondMarket said in a statement:  “The Bitcoin Investment Trust was previously approved by Fidelity as an eligible investment for accredited clients in their self-directed IRA accounts and investments began closing last week. We understand that Fidelity has decided to reevaluate this decision.”  The BIT is currently most popular among tech entrepreneurs, who invest smaller sums, but in greater numbers.  Family offices  Between all of these investment types, the median investment (where half of all investments are lower, and half are higher) is $30,000.  However, the average investment is around $222,000, pushed higher by some weighty investments. There is another group currently bringing the most money into the BIT: family offices.  These are teams appointed by families with a high net worth (typically $100m or more). Families at this level, which may have accumulated their money over many generations, will often use their own teams rather than outsourcing their investments to a fund manager.  Family offices, which serve single or multiple families, will handle a variety of personal services such as accounting, payroll, and wealth management.  “They're taking allocations from what we think to be one or two buckets, says Silbert: gold, and early stage funding. “Family offices tend to be very diversified,” he says. “They tend to have a very long-term investment time horizon.”  If a family office puts some of its gold into bitcoin (which recently exceeded the precious metal’s price) then it can increase that diversity, while treating bitcoin as an early stage startup can help such investors get in on the ground floor. With some analysts predicting a value of $98,500 per bitcoin, such allocation carries a lot of potential.  Phase five  Family offices may be the largest investors now, but if, as Silbert believes, institutional investors get involved, they will be the largest group.  “Phase four is going to be Wall Street, so Wall Street [will have] bitcoin as an investable asset class,” he says, adding that we should expect to see this in the coming year.  All of this heralds the fifth and final phase of bitcoin, which will be mass consumer adoption, according to Silbert. That will happen in 2015, he says.  That promises to revolutionise the way people deal with money, driving efficiencies into the process and potentially saving people money. But for that to happen, the first four stages are necessary to evolve the virtual currency and drive liquidity into the market.  We’re still at the start of phase three, and liquidity is still limited, he says. That means that consumer users will lose a significant percentage on any exchange. This stops consumers from saving much money when using it as a form of money transfer, he says, adding:  “The reason is there's just not enough liquidity at either end of the transfer. But if the monetary base of bitcoin grows to be $20bn, $50bn, $100bn, all of that becomes possible. So I believe that the monetary base needs to grow first before the promise of bitcoin can be fulfilled.”  That’s what SecondMarket is trying to do with the BIT, Silbert concludes: increase awareness, make it more investible as an asset class – and finally, to drive up price by reducing supply.  The Trust has been buying bitcoins from exchanges, merchants, individual users, and miners.  It will be a while before the BIT is publicly traded. But having accrued around 90 investors and just over half a % of all bitcoins mined to date, the Trust is off to a healthy start.

42376762,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eGG1,1387202402,Mt. Gox Bitcoin Price Volatility is up to 50% Higher Than Rival Exchanges,"Last week we looked at price fragmentation across the different exchanges which currently comprise the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index: Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, and BTC-e. Analysis confirmed the common perception that significant, persistent price variations exist across exchanges.  Furthermore, the average price on Mt. Gox was shown to be higher than Bitstamp and BTC-e by $21 and $34 respectively. This phenomenon has been referred to as the ‘Mt. Gox Premium’, which posits that restrictions on US dollar withdrawals have led to bitcoins trading at a higher price on Mt. Gox than the other exchanges.  The ‘Mt. Gox Premium’ is increasing  In last week’s article we looked at data from just over a three-month period, covering late August through to early December. Looking at a more recent one-month window of data, depicted in the chart below, we see a more than doubling of the average price difference between Gox and BTC-e of $70.  In short, the Mt. Gox premium has increased significantly in recent weeks.  Bitcoin volatility  Price variations are not the only way in which Mt. Gox stands out from other exchanges.  It is well known that bitcoin is volatile; the price of a bitcoin is prone to significant fluctuations over short periods of time. But how should bitcoin price volatility be expressed?  For securities like stock, volatility is often expressed by its beta coefficient (or ‘beta’). Beta is a measure of an individual stock’s price volatility against a broader market measure, which is typically an index like the S&P500.  Since the S&P500 is used as a proxy for the market then the S&P500 is assigned a beta value of 1. Thus, a stock with a beta of 1.2 has 20% greater price volatility than the S&P500 index.  Should we calculate beta for bitcoin?  To calculate a beta coefficient for bitcoin, a number of inputs and assumptions are required – such as a risk-free rate of return. In today’s Zero Lower Bound world, central banks have effectively set nominal interest rates as very close to nothing.  Thus, the risk free rate of return is arguably also zero, which presents methodological issues.  There is also the question of which index to measure bitcoin’s volatility against. Should the Dollar Index (DXY) be used? Or perhaps a basket of alternative assets?  In addition, over what time period should we measure bitcoin volatility? Bitcoin has gone through relatively lengthy stretches of flat price performance.  For example, the relative price lull between the March-April period and the recent October-November run-up, where volatility skyrocketed. Volatility measured during the May-September period will yield a very different picture than volatility during the November-early December timeframe.  In sum, calculating a beta for bitcoin at this point in time would appear to offer dubious value.  Some bitcoin exchanges are more volatile than others  Again utilizing data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, we can compare volatility across the three component exchanges (Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, and BTC-e).  One simple measure of exchange volatility is standard deviation. The standard deviation simply expresses the degree of price movement around the average price over a given period of time.  In short, the greater the standard deviation, the higher the price volatility on the exchange.    Table 1: Standard deviation of exchange prices, 27th August - 5th October 2013 (Source: CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index)     MtGoxBitstampBTC-eStandard Deviation$6.06$4.43$4.16    Looking at minute-by-minute price data for the period from 27th August through 5th October (a relatively steady state period when the price for a bitcoin was comparatively flat) we see that the standard deviation for Bitstamp and BTC-e are roughly inline at $4.43 and $4.16, respectively.  Mt. Gox’s standard deviation, however, is much greater at $6.06. This is close to $2 more (or 50% greater) than the standard deviation of BTC-e.  A volatility mystery at Mt. Gox?  But what explains the significantly greater bitcoin price volatility on Mt. Gox?  One of the first explanatory variables to examine on questions of volatility is trading volume. Specifically, lower relative volume could be one factor behind higher volatility, as deep, liquid markets will often bring together more buyers and sellers across a greater range of prices.  Mt. Gox, while not possessing the same dominant 80% share of bitcoin trading volume that it did earlier in the year, still reports total volume market share of 20%-30% of all bitcoins traded.  In other words, if the Gox market share estimates are correct then it would seem unlikely that volume data would explain the higher volatility.  What explains Mt. Gox’s greater volatility? Please share any thoughts you have on why Gox is more volatile than other exchanges in the comments.

42376761,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eGCF,1387198849,"Norwegian Tax Official: Bitcoins Cannot be Defined as ""Money""","Yet another government official has released a statement on bitcoin, and once again the news is mixed.  This time, Bloomberg reported that Norway’s director general of taxation said bitcoins “don’t fall under the usual definition of money or currency”.  The comments, made in an interview with Christian Holte, have been marked by some as yet another failure to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the authorities.  International statements  The comments echo a similar statement from the People’s Bank of China, which was followed by New Zealand and Australia. Although all these statements have carried the message that governments and central banks cannot view bitcoin as a currency, some have been official edicts and others simply offhand comments in interviews.  The bitcoin price has wavered between $785 and $991 on CoinDesk’s BPI for the past week, after recovering from a drop that occurred right after China's comments. The trend has been gradually downward since the $991 week high, standing at $828 at the time of writing.  Price uncertainty  The price in Norwegian krone fell, going from 6,086 to 5,164 NOK in the period since the statements were made.  It is possible these government comments (or at least the media's reaction to them) are responsible for the price uncertainty.  Bitcoin’s November surge to over $1,200 followed more favourable comments by US authorities.  Whether the negative comments should come as any great surprise, or even a ‘blow’ to bitcoin is debatable. Most central banks have a fairly narrow legal definition of ‘currency’ anyway, according to the same Bloomberg report.  Real-world power  Most, including the IMF (International Monetary Fund), recognize currency as something issued only by a nation-state, thus ruling out bitcoin automatically.  Even gold, which appears on some currency conversion charts (like bitcoin), is generally referred to as a commodity and is not accepted in day-to-day life.  As for the Norwegians, there is at least one resident who recognizes bitcoin as something with real-world purchasing power.  Kristoffer Koch made headlines in October when his forgotten stash of bitcoins suddenly reached over $800,000 in value, allowing him to cash out and buy an apartment.  He might now be wishing he’d held them for a few weeks longer.

42376774,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eGSb,1387195202,China's Statement on Bitcoin is Open to Interpretation,"Jack Wang is a co-founder of Dearcoin, a bitcoin startup based in Beijing and developer of Bitpass. He previously practiced technology law in Silicon Valley. He graduated from Stanford University with a degree in EE and received his JD from the University of Chicago.      On 5th December 2013, the Chinese government released their first official statement on bitcoin, declaring, among other things, that it is not a currency.      Many western media outlets have since reported that bitcoin has effectively been banned from real-world use, including its use as a method of exchanging goods and services. These declarations are premature.      The notice places a broad limitation on the types of corporations that can use bitcoin, but its ambiguity leaves much room for interpretation. The truth is that no one can definitively say what is and isn’t allowed at this point.      Nevertheless, in the two weeks since the announcement, bitcoin-related businesses have continued to operate, merchants continue to accept bitcoin, and, in fact, it appears that bitcoin continues to boom in China.    What the notice actually bans  The document titled: “Notice Concerning the Prevention of Risk Related to Bitcoin” which was issued by the People’s Bank of China in conjunction with four other government organizations (the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission), is more of a risk advisory than full-on regulation.  The only explicit ban in the document pertains to the engagement of financial institutions and payment companies in bitcoin-related businesses.  Further regulation will likely be promulgated as the bitcoin industry matures, but for now, the notice only has one explicit prohibition. Understanding the scope of this provision requires a definition of financial institutions and payment companies, as defined by Chinese law.  What are financial institutions?    Using Baidu Baike’s definition compiled from previous notices, there are four kinds of financial institutions:      1) The central bank, ie the People’s Bank of China.      2) Banks, ie commercial banks, policy-oriented banks (such as China Development Bank), and rural banks.      3) Non-banking financial institutions, ie insurance companies, securities companies, investment banks, credit unions, etc.      4) Foreign-owned, overseas Chinese-owned (including Hong Kong, Macao, etc.) and joint venture financial institutions operating in China.    What are payment companies?  Payment companies are a separate category of company authorized to process payments (other than financial institutions, which already have this ability).  These payment companies are a new concept in China. The first batch of licenses were granted on 18th May 2011 to a group of 27 companies (including Alipay, the largest payment processor in the world) and they now number around 100.  Besides a stringent list of qualifications that must be met (detailed here, such as requirements on profitability, management experience and years in business), the four types of business activities that define the scope of a payment company are the following:  1) Payments made over a network, including those made over the internet, mobile phones, fixed land lines, digital TVs, etc.  2) Issuance and acceptance of prepaid cards (any cards issued for the purpose of profit by a third-party other than the merchant whose goods or services can be redeemed with such a card).  3) Bank card acceptance (referring to the acceptance of bank-issued cards at point-of-sale).  4) Any other activity deemed to be 'payment' by the People’s Bank of China.  Presently, these are the only two types of businesses prohibited from participating in bitcoin-related businesses.  In fact, in the People’s Bank of China’s explanatory note (top half of this same link), immediately after noting that bitcoin is not a currency and cannot be recognized as such, recognises that:  “Trading bitcoin is tantamount to buying and selling goods on the Internet, and citizens have the freedom to engage in such activities, as long as it is under the premise that they are responsible for their own risk.”  Can merchants accept bitcoin?    Given the background provided above, we can understand why the Chinese bitcoin startup ecosystem, and particularly those companies who avoid directly converting bitcoin into and out of fiat, have breathed a collective sigh of relief.      The ban only applies to the involvement of financial institutions and payment companies, so any peer-to-peer transaction is allowed. Much of the community currently interprets this notice to mean that merchant sales accepting bitcoin for merchandise or services (a sort of bartering) falls under this type of peer-to-peer transaction and is not prohibited by the law.            Indeed, the notice has not prevented companies like yesbtc, founded by an ex-VP from Tencent ($111bn market cap), from operating a platform that allows users to post merchandise for sale to denominate and guarantee those transactions.  After the release of the notice, yesbtc’s CEO Xin Tang was quoted saying that all bartering services are legal. In addition, numerous independent merchants are adding or or continuing to accept bitcoin as a form of payment.  At the time of writing, there are 320 products listed on Taobao (China’s largest e-commerce platform with transaction volume exceeding $140bn USD annually) that can be purchased with bitcoin.  Typing in 'bitcoin payment' will trigger common search terms as suggested by the Taobao search engine of 'bitcoin payment sale', 'supports bitcoin payment' or 'Can [use] bitcoin to pay'. A search for ‘goods’ yields results ranging from wine to cell phone accessories, cosmetics, luxury bags and sex toys:  Clicking on the first product (above), a red dessert wine produced in China, shows the product description, and more clarification on the payment options available at the bottom of the page.    It specifically notes that:      “The entire store supports payment via bitcoin (BTC). [Orders] executed according to CHBTC (a leading Chinese bitcoin exchange) real-time prices. Order will be shipped after the bitcoin has been transferred to the store owner’s wallet. Can use screenshot as proof of transaction. Trust is of primary importance.”    The mainstream media weighs in    The Chinese media has had a decidedly different tone to its western counterpart. According to a Xinhuanet article (the official press of China) from 8th December, industry insiders note that while bitcoin has not been deemed a currency, two points gave them confidence with respect to the currency’s future development in China.      Firstly, recognizing bitcoin as a type of “Internet good” opens the door for transactions trading bitcoin to be freely conducted. Secondly, the notice did not impose onerous compliance regulations for bitcoin companies, like the regulations previously imposed on issuers of virtual currencies.    Why did Baidu stop taking bitcoin?    A Baidu subsidiary named Jiasule (which provided cloud-based protection services for websites such as DDOS protection) had announced that it would take bitcoin for its services back on 15th October, garnering significant international attention. However, after a notice issued on 6th December, Baidu announced it would stop taking bitcoin.      This was treated by many outside of China as an indication of the government’s so-called “ban” on using bitcoin to trade for goods and services. However, the announcement actually specifies an entirely different reason.    “Dear Jiasule User: Because the price of bitcoin has been fluctuating quite substantially in recent days, and the consumer’s interests cannot be protected, so as to comply with the nation’s spirit of controlling for the risk of bitcoin, Baidu Jiasule has decided to temporarily suspend the acceptance of bitcoin for Jiasule services.”    There is no reference to the legality of accepting bitcoin, but instead the fluctuation in price is specifically cited to be the key reason. So while Jiasule’s decision may have been influenced by the notice, their announcement did not specify that they had been banned from accepting bitcoin.      Indeed, the notice highlighted the need to educate the general public about bitcoin. This corresponds with point 5, as made by the government, which called for the public to increase its awareness of and education regarding currencies and investments and their inherent risks.      Additionally, as part of the second-to-last paragraph of the advisory note, the PBOC included cautionary language with regards to responsibility on the part of financial institutions and payment companies in:      “Preventing the use of bitcoin and such virtual goods as a virtual currency concept to excessively promote, and therefore have detrimental effect on the public’s welfare and the status of the renminbi as legal tender.”              Of course, while the PBOC only oversees financial institutions and payment companies, the spirit of the notice is very much against the “excessive promotion” of bitcoin.      There are examples of companies who may have been using bitcoin for promotional purposes without any sort of accompanying educational literature. For example, Jiangsu Telecom (a provincial branch of China Telecom) offered to accept bitcoin for reserving a new model of a Samsung smartphone, an offer which is no longer available.      Meanwhile, ostensibly to comply with the spirit of the notice, Baidu’s subsidiary hao123.com now has its own bitcoin portal, as do Sina and ifeng, both major news portals and publicly listed Chinese companies.      It is noticeably more balanced than previous coverage, with both the bears and bulls getting a fair hearing. The front pages, moreover, include introductory primers to Bitcoin, full of information targeted at beginners.    Commentary from the Chinese community  The Chinese bitcoin community have been actively debating the meaning of the notice. For a more balanced viewpoint, I asked some of the more influential thought leaders for their opinions.    Changjia, founder of bitcoin news site 8btc and a frequently cited authority on bitcoin in China, said Chinese citizens purchasing goods and services using bitcoin is “presumably allowed,” as it should be viewed as a form of bartering.      Bitcrab, another early bitcoiner and frequently quoted influential community member, also agreed that there is no language in the regulation that prohibited merchants from accepting the cryptocurrency in exchange for goods or services provided.      However, both acknowledge that further information from the government is needed to explain how such transactions would be regulated. Until then, both agree that there is “room to play” for bitcoin merchants.      RS, a Shanghai-based Chinese lawyer and bitcoin enthusiast, provided slightly more colour:      “Trading bitcoins for goods or services is treated as barter, which is free of regulatory restrictions so far. Bitcoin is regarded as a tradable commodity in China, so it is legally permissible to trade bitcoins for goods, services or even currency.”              However, he warns that bitcoin exchanges may soon be subject to tougher regulatory enforcement, as the exchange is acting as a financial intermediary.      “For example, one can’t set up an exchange trading ordinary commodities such as metals, even if the metals are lawful commodities.” He explained that exchanges only provide information and match transactions that they are operating within the legal boundaries currently outlined by the government.      Others I spoke to were somewhat more bullish. Prince, another major bitcoin authority, believes that the regulations are overall very positive for the industry, the details of which I cited in an earlier article.      S, one of the owners of Yibite, a bitcoin media operated by a few of the top bitcoin miners and holders in China, was very surprised to hear that there was coverage in the West on the banning of the trading of goods and services using bitcoin.      Not only does the government explicitly recognize the currency as an Internet good and allow for the free trading of it as such between citizens, there is no reason at this early stage in the industry’s development to have any further specific prohibitions.      “The new government’s policy is to let the market decide, and will only put in broad restrictions from a very macro-level, not blindly try to regulate a market in its infancy.”              However, he did go on to say that other government entities such as those overseeing commerce or taxation may come out with their own regulations, which may or may not be detrimental to bitcoin in China.      The most bullish interpretation is on China’s version of Quora, Zhihu. The top-voted answer (since republished by 8btc, no registration required) to the question: “What are the practical implications of the Notice by the Chinese government on Bitcoin?” was by a bitcoiner named Patrick Luo who believed that any private enterprise that facilitated trades of bitcoin between private individuals, or even trades between bitcoin and RMB, is legal.      “Payment services that recharge RMB for exchanges, or allow for cash withdrawal, is still conducting RMB-related business instead of bitcoin business, and should also be legal.”    Meanwhile, business is booming    Despite the drop in price that followed the government’s announcement, Chinese exchanges have not suffered from loss of business.      At the time of writing, here are some of the larger exchanges and their 24-hour volumes, per Hao123.com. There are already six exchanges (BTC China, OKcoin, FXBTC, BTCTrade, Huobi, CHBTC) with 24-hour volume (last column) regularly exceeding 20,000 BTC and CHBTC only 15% less than market leader BTC China.    What now?    So in the aftermath of the Chinese government’s notice, we must take any definitive pronouncements with a pinch of salt.      The only conclusion we can realistically draw at this point is that no one knows what will be the ultimate scope of China’s regulatory stance on bitcoin. Meanwhile, while the notice seems to have reined in some of the fervor, the bitcoin ecosystem in China continues to push forward enthusiastically.

42422960,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yv9h,1387188638,Radeon GPUs in Demand as Litecoin Mining Difficulty Increases,"Bitcoin mining on a standard GPU is a thing of the past. Put simply: it's no longer economically viable, given the power consumption of discrete graphics cards and their relatively high price.  ASICs are a no-brainer when it comes to bitcoin, however litecoin is a different story.  Unlike its counterpart, litecoin can still be mined using off-the-shelf hardware, namely via AMD Radeon graphics cards. There aren’t that many alternatives, either. There are still no ASIC products for scrypt, litecoin's algorithm, and this will not change for the next few months at least.  It is rumoured that litecoin ASIC systems are being developed by Alpha Technologies, but it will be a few months before they hit the market.  Furthermore, scrypt is a very different beast, as it requires a lot more memory and different ASIC designs. This means that scrypt ASICs could become significantly more expensive than the existing ASIC-based bitcoin mining solutions.  Are litecoin miners causing a Radeon shortage?  In any case, Radeons are currently the weapon choice for litecoin miners and earlier this week several tech sites reported that litecoin miners are causing a shortage of Radeon graphics cards.  While it is true that some cards in some markets are in short supply, it is very difficult to attribute this to litecoin miners without any concrete data from AMD, its add-in-board (AIB) partners and distributors.  Therefore, it is probably convenient to make such claims, as they cannot be easily disproven.  Litecoin mining is booming, that is a fact. Over the last month or so, the litecoin hash rate has doubled, along with difficulty. It was practically flat in September and October.  However, the rate currently stands at about 90GH/s, up from about 20GH/s in June.  People are clearly buying Radeon cards and using them to mine litecoin, but this isn’t necessarily creating a shortage.  According to Jon Peddie Research, the discrete graphics card market is about 14.5 million units per quarter, and AMD’s share is roughly 35%, so AMD partners sell about five million Radeon cards each quarter.  The numbers simply don’t add up, given the hash performance of AMD’s mid-range and high-end cards. In other words, litecoin miners aren’t even close to making much of an impact on AMD’s overall shipments.  There could be some isolated cases though, namely in the US, but it should also be noted that AMD introduced new flagship graphics cards two months ago.  The company also rebranded previous generation cards and it is offering various game bundles to avoid inventory issues and transition to R9- and R7-series products, many of which are simply rebrands of older HD 7000 series cards. There are no Radeon shortages in Europe.  GPUs still have potential for litecoin mining  Since litecoin uses different hashing algorithms than bitcoin, with more access to cache memory and memory in general, existing bitcoin ASICs do not tend to offer good results with litecoin.  Unlike SHA-256, scrypt is memory-hungry and this was an intentional effort on the part of litecoin developers to prevent the use of ASIC and FPGA specialised hardware for litecoin mining.  FPGAs could be used, but at this point it isn't clear whether the performance gain would justify the added cost, especially as difficulty and litecoin value increases.  For the time being, Radeon cards are a relatively good choice for hobby litecoin mining. The biggest problem is power consumption.  A single Radeon R9 290X, based on AMD’s new Hawaii silicon, can draw up to 250W of power under load, but miners claim it is capable of around 860 KH/s to 900KH/s, depending on the GPU clock and other factors. It costs €499 in Europe, or $549 in the US.  Older cards, based on the Tahiti core, can deliver even an even better price/performance ratio and the same is true of the €399 R9 290.  The most popular mining Radeons are the HD 7950, HD 7970 and R9 280, all of which are based on the old Tahiti core and they are now considered mid-range products.  FPGAs should offer superior performance per watt, but then again they are not as readily available as graphics cards. In fact, litecoin specific FPGAs and ASICs are still not available at all.  Furthermore, it is still unclear how much they will cost once they do appear, as hardware requirements for litecoin and bitcoin mining differ greatly.  However, it is difficult to talk about profitability at this point, since litecoin value is going up, along with hash difficulty. Since the price is constantly changing, it is up to individual miners to decide whether GPU-based platforms are viable in the long run. At the moment, the answer is yes, but this could change in a matter of weeks.  Reusing old hardware is another option  Many bitcoin miners who used GPUs are now stuck with old mining rigs, provided they haven't already sold them.  While it is possible to argue that the spike in the litecoin hash rate was caused by miners buying Radeons, it is just as possible that some veteran bitcoin miners have simply found a new use for their old hardware, which has already paid for itself several times over.  It is highly unlikely that all of the miners sold their rigs and are now buying entirely new ones to mine bitcoin.  Oddly enough, some hardware makers are trying to cash in. Last month, ASRock launched two motherboards, designed specifically for mining.  The company's blurb focused on bitcoin, claiming that the boards could help users “make a fortune.”  Needless to say, anyone mining bitcoin with a standard x86 processor and a few Radeons on a cheap motherboard would only stand to gain a whopping electricity bill.  However, the motherboards could be interesting for litecoin miners, as they are relatively cheap and can take up to six graphics cards, although five of them will have to use PCIe 2.0 x1 slots.  So why are prices of Radeon cards going up exactly?  Litecoin mining is definitely a factor, but it is also a temporary spike.  To avoid inventory issues, AMD and AMD AIBs don’t have a habit of stocking up, hence they are probably unable to cope with the sudden spike in demand.  Graphics cards are shipped in batches on a regular basis, not produced overnight.  AMD orders the silicon from TSMC in Taiwan, PCBs and memory chips come from Taiwan, China and Korea, along with coolers, VRMs and other components, so making sure the supply chain works efficiently is a delicate balancing act.  For many people willing to try litecoin mining, Radeons are the equivalent of a gold shovel in mid-19th century California.  AMD’s supply chain is not designed to cope with a sudden influx of new customers who do not care about upcoming games, custom cooled cards or other stuff that are vital to gamers, AMD’s target audience.  Since they feel like they are selling gold shovels, retailers and resellers are acting accordingly, by engaging in price gouging.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | LTC | MARKET | MINING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/16/radeon-gpus-in-demand-as-litecoin-mining-difficulty-increases,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f90ef1f1e6660ba954a7a7a82ae6703adc6e1432-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
