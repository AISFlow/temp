42430778,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxrJh,1564527619,Coinbase Pro to Enable Tezos Trading,"Coinbase Pro announced the coming addition of the proof-of-stake and democratically-governed Tezos blockchain to its institutional trading platform.  Tezos  (XTZ), a multi-million dollar blockchain that officially launched in September 2018, offers the opportunity for its stakeholders to vote on-chain on proposed upgrades. When Tezos was added to another Coinbase affiliate, Coinbase Custody, in March, the move was contested by those who opposed the extension of voting rights to custodial token holders.  It is unclear whether Coinbase Pro will offer “self-amending” duties to users of its platform.  Before trading is activated, Coinbase Pro must build reserves of the coins in trading pairs with BTC and USD. Beginning on Monday, August 5, the firm will accept inbound transfers of XTZ 12 hours in advance of launch, according to a company blog post.  “Once sufficient supply of XTZ is established on the platform, trading on the XTZ/USD, and XTZ/BTC order books will start in phases, beginning with post-only mode and proceeding to full trading should our metrics for a healthy market be met,” the company states.  Similar to onboarding other digital assets to the trading platform, Coinbase expects to move through four stages before tezos functionality is fully operational.  The first is “Transfer-only,"" when orderbooks will only support incoming coins. Once a reserve is established, the platform will enter into the minute-long “Post only” phase, where users will be able to post limit orders that will remain unfulfilled. Third is “Limit-only” in which “limit orders will start matching but customers are unable to submit market orders.”  After these embryonic stages, full trading will be enabled. Importantly, Tezos will not be available on Coinbase itself. Tezos held a $232 million initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017, one of the largest funding events at the time.  Last month, Coinbase Pro added trading Chainlink, the company expects to roll out additional digital assets.

42430772,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxqvh,1564523398,"$500K, 60 Lawyers: Filing Reveals Costs of Bitfinex's Fight With NY Regulators","Bitfinex and Tether have spent half a million dollars just on finding documents for the New York Attorney General's (NYAG) office, a new letter by its lawyers says.  In the letter filed with the New York Supreme Court Tuesday, attorneys Jason Weinstein and Charles Michael of Steptoe and Johnson LLP, and David Miller and Zoe Phillips of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, urged Judge Joel M. Cohen to rule against immediately compelling the crypto exchange and stablecoin issuer to produce all the documents the NYAG demanded.  Cohen previously ruled that Bitfinex and Tether would need to preserve and turn over a subset of those documents, staying the rest of the NYAG's injunction.  ""The Respondents have already spent well over $500,000 responding to just those portions of the document demands that were carved out from the stay,"" the letter says. ""The companies and their personnel use more than 10 different communications platforms – several of which are encrypted and pose substantial collection and review challenges.""  It goes on to add:  ""As a result, the process of responding to the carve-out from the stay involved one of the largest, most complex document collection and review effort in which undersigned counsel have ever participated, involving over 60 lawyers.""  Immediate appeal  The parties argued in court on Monday, with Bitfinex and Tether claiming that the NYAG's office did not have the jurisdiction to compel the production of documents about a loan Tether made to Bitfinex, while the state's attorneys claimed that the documents were necessary for them to continue their investigation.  Cohen did not make a ruling, though he promised to make one ""promptly"" at the end of proceedings. He indicated that if he ruled in favor of the NYAG's office, a preliminary injunction preventing Tether from continuing to loan Bitfinex funds would be probably extended for 90 days, while if he ruled against, the injunction would be dismissed entirely.  If the judge does rule in favor of the NYAG's office, Bitfinex and Tether plan to immediately appeal and would seek a stay pending the final result, the letter states.  The attorneys argued that there are ""significant and challenging legal issues,"" which would mean an appeal ""would unquestionably have merit""; a ruling in favor of the NYAG's office would harm the respondents but a ruling the opposite way would have a ""minimal, if any, impact"" on the NYAG; a ruling in the respondents' favor would not necessarily delay the NYAG; and that it would serve the public interest.  The letter also argues that the line of credit Tether extended to Bitfinex, which is ""at the heart of [the] injunction,"" is already being paid down. This month, Bitfinex announced it had paid $100 million back to Tether through a wire transfer.  Cover-up claims  The NYAG announced in April that it was investigating Bitfinex and Tether due to an alleged $850 million cover-up. The NYAG revealed that Bitfinex could not access the funds, which were being held by its payment processor Crypto Capital, and borrowed from stablecoin issuer Tether's reserves to ensure exchange customers could receive their funds.  However, the NYAG's office did not file a legal complaint, just an injunction that would compel Bitfinex and Tether to produce documents about the matter.  The ongoing legal battle is not preventing the NYAG's office from conducting its investigation, the letter states. Rather, the authorities have continued to look into Bitfinex and Tether's affairs, even while the legal battle played out in court. The letter added:  ""If the OAG believes it has enough information to decide to file an action, as it represented to Justice James, and wants to move forward and file such an action without further delay, then it is of course free to do so. ""  The letter also claimed that there are no victims of Bitfinex or Tether's actions. Tether customers who own USDT can continue to redeem them for U.S. dollars ""on a one-to-one basis,"" the lawyers said.  In a statement, a spokesperson for the NYAG's office said ""We are pleased with yesterday's hearing and look forward to hearing from the judge on the matters in question.""

In this interview with Coindesk’s Leigh Cuen he discusses how his firm’s native utility token gained Reg A+ regulatory approval and what that means for the industry.  “This is the first time ever that a crypto asset got qualification from the SEC that it's okay to distribute this to the general public. I do think that potentially this can help mature the industry and a lot of other projects can benefit from the work that we have we have done,” Ali said.  While earning a PhD in dissipated systems and studying securities regulation Ali said he had an “Ah-Ha moment” when he “realized that technology can adapt faster to regulations then regulations can adapt to the technology.” It’s for that reason Ali is weary that future use of the Blockstack network may “be impacted by the initial framework used to distribute the token.”  That being said, though the SEC has placed regulatory constraints and compliance requirements on the token, the filing is still beneficial as it “reduces information asymmetry between project insiders like myself and the general public.”  ""I think in general I am obviously very optimistic about the coming years. Just like our SEC qualification went through... I remain very confident that the same would happen for exchanges as well,"" he said. ""So we will actually have more accountability [and] more transparency. ... I look at it as an industry that is maturing, right. You're already doing so many innovative things you can reuse lessons from past decades for why it's a good thing to have discipline and why it's a good thing to be transparent... all regulations are not bad.""

Other high-ranking engineering staffers are leaving too, CoinDesk has learned.  Wagner, Coinbase’s vice president of engineering, will be departing in the next two weeks, a Coinbase spokesperson confirmed. The departure will leave a vacancy on the company’s leadership team.  Previously, Wagner served more than six years at Amazon Web Services, making him one of the most senior alums of big tech to join the cryptocurrency industry. Wagner joined shortly after Coinbase acquired Earn.com and made Balaji Srinivasan its chief technology officer.  Wagner is another example of a senior member of the team departing the company in recent months. In May, Coinbase lost both CTO Srinivasan and COO Asiff Hirji. A recent report by The Information exposed tensions between the two men that caused turmoil in the company's executive ranks.  More changes  CoinDesk was also able to confirm three other notable departures at the company outside of the leadership team.  Wagner’s departure follows that of Namrata Ganatra, Coinbase’s now-former senior director of engineering. Ganatra announced yesterday that she’d be joining Lambda School as the education startup’s new CTO.  Coinbase veteran and current engineering director Varun Srinivasan is also leaving, the company confirmed to CoinDesk. After nearly four and a half years at Coinbase, Srinivasan’s departure is in the works but has yet to be finalized.  Facebook alum and Coinbase’s former director of design, Connie Yang, left the company some months ago. She did not respond to a request for comment as of press time.  Coinbase employs roughly 700 people across multiple offices.  Nick Tomaino, an early Coinbase employee who now runs investment firm 1confirmation, says turnover at San Francisco’s crypto unicorn is no big deal.  ""Coinbase is a utility for the industry and its success as a company is solely dependent on the success of the cryptocurrency industry as a whole,"" Tomaino wrote in a message to CoinDesk.

With the issuance, the bank also conducted the first blockchain-based transaction by a Filipino bank.  The PHX stablecoin is pegged to the Philipino peso and backed by UnionBank reserves.  “PHX is a stable store of value, medium of exchange and is a programmable token with self-executing logic. It enables transparent and automatic execution of payments,” said UnionBank Senior Vice President Arvie de Vera.  UnionBank’s blockchain transaction occurred on its i2i payment system which connects islands, institutions and individuals, per PhilStar. Three rural banks took part in the inaugural transfer.  PHX is available to all UnionBank account holders and purchasable through debits to account holders. In the long run, UnionBank plans on making PHX and i2i interoperable platforms across wallets and platforms in the Philippines and abroad.  The stablecoin and i2i system are hardly baby steps for UnionBank which has maintained a growing interest in digital assets. In February 2019, the bank launched the first two-way virtual currency ATM, largely to address remittance service demand.  Remittance services continue to set the pace for bank development of digital assets. Financial giant J.P. Morgan launched its own payment rail, JPM Coin, on its Quorum blockchain earlier this year. Global settlement network SWIFT has also upped settlement time recently in a bid to counter alternative services like Ripple.  Some 10 million Filipinos live abroad creating a large demand for remittance services. In April, Coins.ph inked a deal with Western Union for direct settlement into Coin.ph wallets.

Described as a ‘black box’ for your gun, the company's signature device captures visual, audio, and other data for events requiring lethal force. Sensing sudden environmental changes, Justifire records dangerous encounters with the intention of protecting the right to self-defense in both the legal and public sphere.  According to the patent, the 3 inch by 3 inch by 1.5-inch device will incorporate blockchain technology for end-to-end data integrity. Through blockchain, the Justifire attachment will send data to a network of nodes for encryption and storage. The patent hints at possibly tokenizing the data to incentivize node participation:  ""Nodes of the blockchain network may include client devices, servers, and firearm environmental recording apparatuses, and tokens of a cryptocurrency may be provided to nodes for performing data transactions in the blockchain database.""  Currently, the system uses two mounted SD cards to store encrypted data. Inventor and Justifire CEO Jason Palazzolo argues pairing Justifire with blockchain breathes integrity into sticky legal situations:  ""Justifire uses a combination of autonomous sensors to capture every aspect of any given situation. In case of self-defence, this data can be used to recreate the actions and events leading up to and after discharge of a firearm,"" he said.  The firm is seeking additional funding to continue development of its product including new tools like ultrasonics, thermal, and laser imaging radar. With the patent, Justifire is pivoting toward blockchain development and implementation.

At least, that was the drift of a U.S. Senate hearing Tuesday on cryptocurrency regulation, where lawmakers and witnesses scrutinized the oft-repeated claim that the technology will spur financial inclusion.  During the Senate Banking Committee hearing, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) questioned Jeremy Allaire, CEO of crypto exchange Circle Internet Financial, on the matter.  ""What it sounds like to me is tech people wanting to wave a wand and skip a bunch of steps and avoid the tough politics of doing things for people and say, 'We've got a new tech that will solve all this stuff,'"" Schatz told Allaire. ""Do you really think that in a society in which only 81 percent of the public currently has a smartphone, we're anywhere close to democratizing the use of these products?""  It may well be that blockchain becomes a widely-used tool, but this does not mean it will solve the problem of banking the financially excluded, Schatz said, telling Allaire:  ""I don't doubt the potential for this tech, I just don't think it's going to bank low income communities and I don't think you've persuaded anyone here that it's going to do that.""  Allaire agreed that the problem of financial inclusion is complex.  ""These are human issues and real policy issues and the risks we have to address in the financial system ... those exist significantly. This technology actually does provide an avenue to improve upon those but there's no silver bullet here,"" he said.  Not a tech problem  Another witness on the panel, University of California law professor Mehrsa Baradaran noted that roughly a quarter of the entire U.S. population does not have access to the nation's financial system, and spend ""billions"" paying alternative service providers to quickly access cash. However, this is not a technological issue, but rather one of public policy, she contended.  Baradaran believes that unbanked individuals need a point of access, and while blockchain is one technology that can help, ""there are many easier ways"" of providing this access.  ""The problems of low-income and underbanked customers is not that they're unsatisfied by existing tech, the problem is they live in a banking desert ... there is no place to [use a card] because banks are no longer interested in serving those customers,"" she said.  Schatz clarified that he doesn't think blockchain is a useless technology, but that in his view, adoption requires a number of intermediary steps that are not being addressed.  ""I don't doubt the importance of the technology or that we'll probably all be using it in two decades but I think that's a different assertion than 'oh, by the way, it's going to solve all these societal ills,'"" Schatz said.  He concluded:  ""The important thing here is to understand what this tech does and what it doesn't do, because if we're going to establish a regulatory framework for this we need to not be so triumphant about all the problems that it's going to solve but we also need to be clear-eyed about the problems it may create but also the potential for it.""  Following the hearing, Coinbase chief legal officer Brian Brooks noted on Twitter that ""Even those that are skeptical of the promise of cryptocurrencies often recognize the shortcomings of the current financial system and the effects of excluding large segments of the population from traditional banking services.""  However, he indicated that blockchain, as the ""latest breakthroughs in peer-to-peer technology,"" is likely to be necessary to improving the current financial system.

The Curzio Equity Owners’s (CEO) token represents an equity stake in the financial publishing analytics firm Curzio Research’s newsletter business. The token presents a path to invest in a “scalable, high-margin industry that is normally difficult for outsiders to access,” according to a statement.  The Coinbase-backed firm previously tokenized assets in collaboration with Cityblock Capital, Protos, and Lottery.com, among others, to provide ownership opportunities ""that people can purchase instead of using traditional non-digital methods,"" according to a Securitize spokesperson. Investments can be placed in either fiat or cryptocurrencies, while dividends can be paid in Circle and Coinbase’s USDC stable coin.  To date, Securitize's Ethereum-based protocol holds nearly $200 million spread over 9 on-chain tokenized securities, with an average of 150 investors per asset. Five of these assets trade on regulated markets like Open Finance Network, Sharespost, and tZero's alternative trading system (ATS).  The costs involved in tokenizing an asset include “securing legal advice, issuance and management platform fees, broker-dealer fees - if a broker-dealer is required for fundraising - and listing fees - if a listing takes place,” according to a Securitize representative. In April, the firm launched the Securitize Ready Program, an advisory network including Coinbase Custody and OpenFinance to assist in issuance, management, and compliance of securities.  In this instance, “Curzio did all the definition and legal work, whilst Securitize did all the technical work to support the process of investor onboarding, as well as issuance and management of the security token, and the preparation of all smart contracts for the digital security,"" according the representative.  ""I’m excited to be an early adopter of digital securities, an industry that's disrupting the traditional high-fee investment banking business model,” Curzio CEO Frank Curzio said in a statement.  Curzio is not alone. In the past quarter Securitize signed on 17 companies bringing a total of 43 companies using Securitize services. Additionally, the company has forged partnerships with industry-leading names like BitGo, Coinbase, and tZero to help the companies meet compliance requirements for the management of digital securities.

42430763,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxqnh,1564495224,"Former Mt Gox CEO Karpeles Must Face US Class Action, Judge Rules","Mark Karpeles, former CEO of the early bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, must face a class action lawsuit brought in Philadelphia over the firm's collapse in 2014.  According to a Reuters report on Monday, District Judge Robert Kelly has refused Karpeles' request to dismiss the suit, which alleges that the former CEO had concealed issues at the exchange from its users.  A court document on the ruling indicates that the case has been brought by a former customer of Mt. Gox, Gregory Pearce on his own behalf and others affected by the failure of the exchange. He alleges that Karpeles, who was the ""sole controlling force"" of the Tokyo-based exchange, knew there were ""security bugs in the system but did not make these defects known to the public.""  Karpeles had argued that the Philadelphia court did not have jurisdiction in the case and sought a dismissal, however Judge Kelly rejected his argument on Friday, according to the report.  The court document cites Pearce's claim that he had ordered a physical security key from Mt. Gox and that he had requested that it be sent to his Philadelphia address.  The suit was originally brought in 2018 against Karpeles and Mihuzo Bank, but the court found it did not have jurisdiction over the bank. Pearce is claiming one count of negligence and one count of fraud against Karpeles.  Karpeles has been the subject of numerous lawsuits over his role in Mt. Gox's failure. In 2016, a similar class action in Canada was dismissed.  He's also been found innocent of most charges in a more recent Tokyo criminal trial in which he was charged with embezzlement, breach of trust and manipulating data on the exchange. Karpeles was found guilty only on the data charge, one he said he'd appeal in March.

The institutionally-weighted, and independently-funded custodial wing of Coinbase will provide cold storage as well as a wallet for holders of Props. The tokens were designed by YouNow developers as a way to reward users of the platform and its content creators.  Furthermore, the Coinbase wallet will act as the default wallet offered by YouNow to users.  ""This wallet has a tighter integration with the YouNow app, which makes for a smooth UX when using Props,"" according to a company statement. YouNow has a 47 million user base.  Currently available on YouNow, with three additional applications announced, Props’ unique Reg A+ investment structure, and regulatory status, acts as an incentive for users to build upon and disseminate the platforms on which the tokens operate by giving holders a vested interest in the platforms' success.  Indeed, Yonatan Sela, Co-founder of Props, told CoinDesk that since launching earlier this month, more than 230,000 individuals have acquired Props through engaging with either YouNow.  Additionally, while he couldn’t disclose hard figures, Sela said YouNow has seen “content creation increase by double digit figures [since the introduction of the Props rewards incentive], which is huge for a platform all about content creation.”  As part of the regulatory arrangement, which took approximately a year to sort out, Props are fully transferable between participating wallets and platforms, but cannot be exchanged for fiat currency. In this sense, Props function as a utility token, bound to its specific purpose.  However, through the Coinbase Custody listing, the institutional investors and major content creators that hold Props will be able to shield their funds with an industry-recognized custodian. All digital assets with Coinbase Custody are segregated and covered by the company’s insurance policies. Sam McIngvale, CEO of Coinbase Custody, said in a statement:  ""No other platform can offer the safety and protection of our technology and comprehensive insurance. But more than that, for projects like Props where network participation and validators are critical to the chain’s operation, Coinbase Custody offers the only option that allows for both the secure cold storage of assets and the ability to interact with the network.”  Sela noted in 2017, Props pre-sold $21.5 million tokens to such investors, who “have received the tokens, and have meaningfully exposure.” He said these holders include Union Square Ventures, Comcast, and Coinfund.  Though the token has attracted a number of institutional investors, Sela also stressed the amount of holders who first came to cryptocurrencies through being rewarded with Props.  Sela said:  “It’s an experiment to see what happens when putting a crypto token in hands of real world people that are attracted by its utility.”  YouNow screenshots courtesy of YouNow",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/30/coinbase-custody-to-list-younows-props-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e178395daefa18df49148aa4814623b0b882db55-951x508.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced by Pundi X in a blog post on Monday, the firms have entered a symbiotic relationship regarding their wallet tech, with Pundi X integrating with Samsung's Blockchain Wallet and making its XWallet available to the Galaxy S10 phone's blockchain app options.  ""This presents a unique opportunity to push blockchain technology and blockchain-based digital assets into the mainstream, reaching the millions of Samsung smartphone users around the world,"" firm says in the post.  Pundi X claims the news makes it the first fintech app in the S10's blockchain ecosystem.  S10 users adding XWallet to the Samsung Blockchain Wallet will be able to move cryptocurrencies between the two apps. Pundi X suggests that users can use Samsung's wallet to store cryptos securely, ""like a savings account,"" and moving them to the XWallet ""checking account"" for use in payments.  Pundi X added that, with XWallet recently becoming available via XPOS – the firm's blockchain point-of-sale device – more payment options will be on offer for S10 users as a result. XWallet is also connected with XPASS, Pundi X's NFC-enabled crypto payment card product.  The firm said:  ""The XWallet’s integration with the Samsung Blockchain Wallet thus makes Pundi X payment ecosystem available to a much wider audience, allowing the Samsung Galaxy smartphone users to not only store their ETH securely but also transfer to XWallet and spend it in a variety of shops, opening their doors to the new generation and their preferred cryptocurrencies.""  Samsung launched its S10 flagship phone back in March, revealing a bold blockchain play that saw it offer the crypto wallet alongside decentralized apps (dapps), merchant payments and other features such as blockchain signing.  Details of Pundi X's device were aired at the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona in February and a launch is expected later this year. The prototype XPhone is said to be able to make calls over a blockchain.

42430767,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxr1h,1564485826,Multicoin Leads $20 Million Round for Speed-Focused Solana Blockchain,"Promising Layer 2 speeds on a Layer 1 platform, Solana has raised a $20 million Series A to build a blockchain meant to operate on the mass scale of the world wide web.  The company announced Tuesday that Multicoin Capital, the Austin, Texas-based investment firm, had led the round. Distributed Global, Blocktower Capital, Foundation Capital, Blockchange VC, Slow Ventures, NEO Global Capital, Passport Capital and Rockaway Ventures also participated. The firms received SOL tokens in exchange for their investment, not equity in Solana, Inc., according to a spokesman.  In a statement to CoinDesk, Multicoin co-founder Kyle Samani said:  ""Solana is the only chain that scales at Layer 1 while preserving architectural and political decentralization, ensuring that smart contracts retain the key properties of being composable and modular.""  The Solana founding team comes primarily from telecom hardware giant Qualcomm. After publishing a white paper in late 2017, the company raised a seed round in 2018 and has built a private testnet. Solana says it will push its Series A funding toward engineering and project management as it nears a mainnet launch in the coming months.  Along with the funding round, the company is also announcing the launch of its public devnet. Solana recently announced an incentivized testnet event similar to Cosmos’ “Game of Stakes.” Solana's “Tour de SOL” begins in August.  “We’ve seen the challenges that developers are facing with Layer 2 and sharding solutions, and we’re excited to give them an incredibly simple alternative that doesn’t sacrifice performance,” Solana co-founder and CEO Anatoly Yakovenko said in a statement. “Other than Solana, all blockchains are single-threaded processors. That is, they can only make one state update at a time. This is the single greatest challenge holding back the industry today.”  Solana claims its multi-threaded solution can support 50,000 transactions per second (TPS) on a global network of 200 nodes. For comparison, the fastest of the major blockchains, Tron and Ripple, say they can handle 2,000 TPS and 1,500 TPS, respectively. The network of payments giant Visa, meanwhile, can process 65,000 TPS, according to the company’s latest annual report.

Blockchain’s head of retail products, TD Ameritrade alum Nicole Sherrod, told CoinDesk the custodial exchange, called The PIT, can connect to non-custodial Blockchain wallets for nearly instant transfers. Registration opens today, with the ability to trade up to 26 assets rolling out over the next two weeks.  Sherrod said that with nearly 40 million wallets already created – and an exchange matching-engine set up in London’s Equinix LD4 data center – PIT could be posed to attract more liquidity than competitors.  “That’s what market makers are looking for,” Sherrod said. “They want to co-locate [data center servers] with you, they want to directly connect to your matching engine. It’s the way it’s done on Wall Street.”  Indeed, Tom Haller, previously the chief software architect for trading systems at the New York Stock Exchange, contributed to the development of PIT’s matching engine.  Sherrod added the exchange will measure speed in “microseconds,” like traditional asset exchanges. However, an anonymous industry expert was skeptical about whether that theoretical speed with remain constant under real pressures. The source said many infrastructure dependencies are “almost impossible to model out,” so the system will only prove itself when tested by “real-world trading volumes.”  Either way, Blockchain is prioritizing diverse token offerings over margin trading options and the bitcoin software update SegWit, both of which are also on the road map.  “Beyond the 26 [assets] we already know what our phase two asset listings are going to be, as well as phase three,” Sherrod said, declining to name any assets beyond what the wallet already supports.  It remains to be seen how PIT will compete with mainstream exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, which also offer a plethora of crypto assets. Coinbase was also a wallet provider and brokerage, before it became Silicon Valley’s iconic unicorn exchange.  “We’re looking to compete on the overall client experience,” Sherrod said, adding that a new customer support team has become the second-largest division of the company as part of a broader shift to exchange services.  Mainstream exchanges are generally slow to respond to retail users when market activity spikes, so Sherrod argued that beyond speed this is another area where PIT could rival incumbents.  Only time will tell if the new revenue flows Blockchain users generate through transaction fees will justify this expansion into the heavily saturated exchange space, with fierce competition for market makers and heavily regulatory costs.  Blockchain is applying for new licenses in various jurisdictions, Sherrod said, but failed to specify which ones. In the meantime, the exchange won’t operate in any jurisdiction that requires a license, a spokesperson added.

42382439,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9re2X,1564480802,Golden Cross Provides Glimmer of Hope for Bitcoin Price Revival,"View  Bitcoin's three-day chart is reporting a golden cross, a long-term bull market indicator, for the first time since February 2016. A similar crossover seen six months ahead of the August 2016 mining reward halving paved way for a mega bull run.  History may repeat itself with mining reward halving due in less than 12 months.  BTC may rise back to $10,000 in the next 24 hours or so with short duration charts signaling seller exhaustion.  A UTC close above $11,120 is needed to revive the bullish view. On the downside, key support is seen at $9,049 (July 17 low).      Bitcoin's (BTC) bulls have reason to be optimistic despite the recent 33 percent price drop, as a long-term technical indicator has turned bullish.  The 50-candle price average has crossed above the 200-candle average on the three-day chart, confirming a golden cross – a bull market indicator. That is the first such crossover on the three-day chart since Feb. 3, 2016, according to Bitstamp data.  That long-term moving average crossovers are lagging indicators and have limited predictive powers at best is widely known. So, seasoned traders may consider the latest cross as a product of BTC's rally from December's low of $3,122 to June's high of $13,880. After all, MAs follow price and, the longer the time-frame of the MA, the bigger the lag.  Even so, the bulls can take heart from the golden cross, which has proved its mettle as a reliable indicator in the past, as discussed earlier this month.  Golden crosses 2016 and 2019        Bitcoin witnessed a golden cross in the three days to Feb. 3, 2016 – six months ahead of the mining reward halving – following which the cryptocurrency charted its way to a record high of $20,000 by December 2017.  With another reward halving (effectively, a supply cut) due in less than 12 months, history may just repeat itself.  As of writing , BTC is changing hands at $9,500 on Bitstamp, down 31.55 percent from June's high of $13,880. The cryptocurrency could rise to $10,000 in the next 24 hours, according to the short-duration technical charts.  4-hour chart  The long-tailed doji seen on the 4-hour chart reflects the fact that sellers failed to keep prices at lows near $9,100 on July 28, with buyers pushing prices all the way back to $9,500.  The candle widely considered a sign of seller exhaustion, more so since it has appeared following a more than 30-percent decline from June's high of $13,880.  Daily chart  A bearish lower-highs pattern, as represented by the falling trendline, is intact. The 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are also trending south.  The 14-day relative strength index is reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 print. The indicator, however, is now flatlining, indicating a weakening of bearish momentum.  More importantly, dips to or below $9,400 have been consistently short-lived since July 16, also a sign of seller exhaustion.  As a result, a rise back to $10,000 in the next 24 hours cannot be ruled out. That said, a bull revival would require a UTC close above the bearish lower high of $11,120 created on July 20.

BitFlyer Europe announced the news on Tuesday, saying the new trading platform targets people wanting ""a simple way to buy and sell bitcoin, from total beginners to experienced traders."" Until now, the firm offered only a pro-trader service, dubbed Lightning, as its euro-bitcoin marketplace.  Available via the bitFlyer Europe website, the ""bitFlyer Buy/Sell"" service allows users to exchange bitcoin for euros, with a maximum of 20 BTC per transaction.  According to its website, the service is not an order book exchange and users will pay no fees on sales or purchases of bitcoin. Presumably, in that case, bitFlyer is making its money on the spread between its own buying and selling prices.  Indeed, while the global average price for bitcoin displayed on crypto data service CoinMarketCap is €8,526 at time of writing, bitFlyer is offering sales at €8,727.  On sign-up, new users are expected to check a box indicating they are not residents of the U.S. Standard know-your-customer procedures request personal details such as address and phone number, as well as an identity documents like a passport or driving license.  The firm describes itself as the ""only"" crypto exchange to be licensed in Japan, the U.S. and the EU.  Andy Bryant, co-lead and COO of bitFlyer Europe, said:  “bitFlyer Buy/Sell is a virtual currency exchange for everyone – with simple two-click buy and sell capability.

In a frank disclosure in the firm's latest quarterly report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the firm said that the many barriers it will face regarding regulating a new technology with unclear rules in the U.S. and other nations of the world, mean ""there can be no assurance that Libra or our associated products and services will be made available in a timely manner, or at all.""  ""Our participation in the Libra Association will subject us to significant regulatory scrutiny and other risks that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results,"" Facebook says.  And not only is Libra ""based on relatively new and unproven technology,"" the laws and regulations around digital currency are ""uncertain and evolving.""  ""Libra has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue,"" the SEC filing states.  As the firm says, the Libra project – which could potentially bring about crypto adoption to the billions of Facebook users – has caused something of an uproar in regulatory circles.  Central banks, government ministers and watchdog chiefs have been lining up to demand more information on the project over fears it could pose a threat to central bank money and financial stability, and provide a global avenue for money laundering and fraud.  The G7 nations formed a task force to look into issues around cryptocurrencies, but with a steely focus on Libra. It concluded earlier in July that regulations of the ""highest standard"" would be needed to govern the project.  Some, including the head of the House Financial Services Committee, have even called for the project to be halted while such concerns are addressed.  Facebook further says in the filing:  ""These laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations, may delay or impede the launch of the Libra currency as well as the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business.""  The firm's own doubts about the viability of its project are not all down to regulation, either. It cited the uncertainty of Libra taking off as a popular product as another potentially confounding factor, as well as it's own lack of ""significant prior experience with digital currency or blockchain technology.""  This may ""adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and services.""  Facebook also seems a but worried about how much it's splashing out on this potential white elephant project. It concludes in the filing:  ""We will also incur increased costs in connection with our participation in the Libra Association and the development and marketing of associated products and services, and our investments may not be successful.

Initially, the exchange will offer BTC and ETH, each of which can trade against the fiat currencies CHF, EUR, GBP and USD.  Smart Valor CEO Olga Feldmeier told CoinDesk in an email:  ""Today, Switzerland is the largest global wealth destination, home to a quarter of all global offshore wealth. For over 200 years this place stands for data privacy, safety and security, with an impeccable reputation and high-quality banking services. The same is true for Liechtenstein.

Smart Valor is changing this, giving the privilege of stable, safe-haven jurisdiction not only to the rich, but to all.""  Smart Valor was approved as a regulated financial intermediary in Switzerland late last year. Venture Incubator is a joint initiative of ETH Zurich and consulting firm McKinsey & Company, and has backing from 10 of Switzerland's most significant companies.  With the basic exchange now live, more tokens will be added monthly, with the goal of making it a leading exchange for security tokens backed by real-world assets, the company said in a press release.  “While hundreds of exchanges were created during the last several years, today there are just about a dozen which are legal, compliant, licensed and safe,” Smart Valor investor David Johnston said in a statement. ""Switzerland, being at the top of the hierarchy of financially savvy but crypto-friendly jurisdictions, needs its own Coinbase.""  The exchange's launch is accompanied by a campaign that gives initial users fee-free trading and brokerage services during the first three months. Not surprisingly, the full capacity of the early access program has been taken up by 5,000 users registered on the platform prior to today’s launch.

42382438,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9re01,1564459219,"Millions in Crypto Is Crossing the Russia-China Border Daily. There, Tether Is King","The Takeaway  Chinese importers in Russia are buying up to $30 million a day of tether (USDT) from Moscow’s over-the-counter trading desks.  They use the cryptocurrency to send large sums back to their home country, which has strict capital controls.  Previously the merchants used bitcoin for this, but when the market crashed in 2018 they switched to tether, which is designed to maintain parity with the U.S. dollar.  Despite longstanding questions about USDT’s collateral, in this market “nobody actually cares if tether is backed or not,” says one Moscow trader.      Vrrrrrrrrrrrrr.....  The cash-counting machines were softly buzzing in an office with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Moscow's landmarks.  “Hear that sound?” asked the head of an over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency trading desk — let’s call him 'Oleg' — who requested his real name and company be withheld. “You can hear it 24/7 in here.”  Business is brisk thanks to a constant flow of Chinese merchants who come in daily with heavy bags of cash. Oleg said his OTC desk sells about $3 million worth of crypto every day. Most of it usually goes to China. But what's perhaps most surprising is which crypto.  Only 20 percent of Oleg's sales are in bitcoin, the oldest cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization. The other 80 percent is in the dollar-pegged token known as tether, or USDT.  Tether's best-known application is allowing crypto traders to move money between exchanges quickly to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. But according to several Moscow OTC traders, it has at least one real-world use case – as the go-to remittance service for local Chinese importers.  The total volume of USDT purchased by Chinese businesses can reach $10 million to $30 million daily, these traders said.  “They accumulate a lot of cash in Moscow and need tether to transfer it to China,” said Maya Shakhnazarova, head of OTC trading at Huobi Russia, the Moscow office serving high-roller clients of Singapore-based exchange Huobi Global.  It's a simple process.  “A client comes with cash, we register the price at exchanges, when we agree on a price, we make a deal,” Shakhnazarova told CoinDesk. “The client hands over cash and a wallet address, the seller sends USDT to the wallet.”  Why tether? It has the usual advantages of crypto – no limits on how much money can be sent or where – without the volatility that makes most coins infeasible for moving millions across the border daily.  Despite longstanding questions about USDT's purported dollar backing, exacerbated by the New York State Attorney General (NYAG) court case against the issuing company Tether, the stablecoin usually trades around $1.  The tether-for-rubles purchases often take place in offices like Huobi's in the steel-and-glass skyscraper district of Moscow City.  “There are a lot of OTCs here in Moscow City, a bunch of offices in every building, and the volumes for them all can reach several dozens of millions of dollars a day. It’s all paid for in cash,” Shakhnazarova said.  Tether’s killer app  Chinese grey-market importers used to rely on bitcoin before the 2018 bear market, another OTC dealer, Roman Dobrynin, told CoinDesk. As the price was ever-growing, merchants and the intermediaries helping them buy crypto could make some extra money along the way.  But since the beginning of 2018, hoping that your bitcoin will still be worth the same or more at the end of the transfer became too risky.  “As the price was going down, tether became much more convenient to use,” said Dobrynin. “China is totally reliant on USDT, they trust in it a lot, plus it’s very liquid.” His own clients are mostly Chinese, and they usually find him by word of mouth, connecting via Telegram.  To buy or sell USDT for dollars from Tether itself, a trader must be verified through the company's know-your-customer (KYC) process. However, since the token runs on top of public blockchain networks (bitcoin, ethereum and tron), anyone can receive or send it, and secondary trades are unrestricted.  Tether did not respond to requests for comment by press time.  Back in China, the merchants can exchange USDT for fiat easily, even though the People’s Bank of China banned fiat-to-crypto spot trading in September 2017, forcing the exchanges to move out of the country and limiting trading to crypto-to-crypto pairs.  Chinese traders who need to liquidate crypto assets into Chinese yuan can still go to an OTC market maker, such as those registered on exchanges like Huobi and OKEx, to get matched with buyers and send them crypto after receiving a wire transfer via a bank, AliPay or WeChat Pay.  Critics of Tether have long questioned whether the stablecoin was fully backed 1:1 with dollars, as the company long insisted. The NYAG case revealed that Tether had loaned a big chunk of its capital reserves to Bitfinex, an exchange with overlapping management and owners, leaving the coin only 74 percent collateralized by cash and equivalents.  None of this seems to faze the Moscow traders or their Chinese clients.  “Nobody actually cares if tether is backed or not,” says Konstantin Plavnik, chief operating officer of Moscow-based crypto derivatives exchange Xena. Confidence in Tether’s solvency relies on long-time habit and convenience: this market needs tether, so tether is trusted.  OTC traders also point out that USDT's daily volume exceeds its supply in circulation several times over, which indicates that people turn the token around multiple times during the day. For example, according to CoinMarketCap, on July 29, the 24-hour volume of USDT was recorded at $17.5 billion, while the total supply was just around $4 billion.  The turnaround of tether is fast, so for the merchants using the token for remittances, whether it’s worth something or not matters only within one day. Large batches of USDT get transferred to China overnight and then exchanged for yuan, crypto entrepreneurs in Moscow told CoinDesk.  “USDT will stay propped by the power of habit and trust of its users,” said Vladislav Bulochnikov, the head of product at crypto wallet app provider Chatex. “Even if it loses half of its backing — it’ll still be out there.”  Skirting capital controls  Stepping back, the Chinese government maintains strict capital controls, limiting the amount of foreign currency anyone can buy or sell to $50,000 a year. People can apply for an additional quota, but still the amount of currency they can buy and sell will be limited. In this situation, some Chinese have opted to use crypto to move money across the border, Bloomberg reported in 2017.  The fact that Chinese merchants bringing cheap goods to Moscow’s shopping malls use crypto to move money around was all but officially recognized by the Russian authorities last year.  Several large malls in the city account for around $9.5 billion of unregulated cash flow monthly, and most of the merchants are from China, said Yuri Polupanov, the Bank of Russia's head of financial monitoring and currency control, during an event hosted by Thomson Reuters in Moscow in April 2018.  These malls, located inside huge warehouses on the outskirts of Moscow, host multiple retail stands, selling mostly clothing, usually for cheap and for cash. They are shopping Meccas for people who can’t afford to spend much on their wardrobes and avoid even mass-market chain stores.  “We see most of the revenue turned into cryptocurrency, which is not reported in any way at the moment,"" Polupanov said at the Thomson Reuters event, according to the RBK news agency. ""We see simultaneous transfers of that cryptocurrency via email to the homeland of those merchants and producers, and the following exchange of it for the local currency there.”  According to a March 2019 report in the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, cash would be received at places like a hotel called “Druzhba” (“Friendship” in Russian), located next to the shopping mall named “Moscow.” Then this cash would be swapped for crypto and sent to Hong Kong.  The wholesale trade offices at Druzhba could be turning around $10 million to $12 million daily, Novaya Gazeta's sources estimated.  The operations were ceased for a short time after police raided the hotel, along with the malls mentioned by the Bank of Russia, in March of this year.  Small crypto desks are still functioning at those malls, OTC trader Dobrynin believes, though they likely don’t provide the volumes merchants need.  Outside traders are often afraid to go to those areas to make deals as things can get dangerous there, he said, explaining:  “The personnel working there can sell somebody information about how much money you have, and some armed people can meet you on your way back. People go there only with armed bodyguards.”  Wolfie Zhao contributed reporting.

42382434,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rdwF,1564448404,Prime Trust Launches Instant Settlement Network for Crypto-Fiat Trades,"The Nevada-based financial institution Prime Trust has launched a real-time settlement network for asset transfers among its clients, competing with similar services offered by crypto-friendly U.S. banks Silvergate and Signature.  Announced Monday, the new service, known as PrimeX, gives Prime Trust's clients immediate access to funds when they trade cryptocurrency or fiat with each other. The trust company will not charge for the new service, either. It is available 24/7 and has no limit on transfer amounts, according to the announcement.  The network is already used by “industry-leading exchanges, OTC desks, market makers, stablecoins, and traders,” the company said, without identifying any of these clients. Accordingly, all counterparties are known on the network and must agree to send or receive funds to or from one another before transactions can take place.  Prime Trust, despite its small size, has played an outside role in the crypto industry. It handles custody of fiat for a number of dollar-backed stablecoins, offers cold-storage custody for crypto assets, and provides fiat deposit and withdrawal services for Huobi's U.S. exchange, HBUS.  Kevin Lehtiniitty, Chief Product Officer at Prime Trust, said in a statement:  “Leveraging Prime Trust’s ability to custody a wide variety of assets, the Prime Exchange Network is the world’s first platform for 24/7 settlement of multiple FIAT currencies, as well as digital assets, all in one qualified custodian.”  Earlier this year, Prime Trust's New York-based competitor Signature Bank introduced the Signet system, which as of early February had more than 100 clients transferring millions of dollars a day to each other. Likewise, Silvergate Bank has on-boarded a number of major crypto exchanges, hedge funds, and miners that use the California institution's settlements platform to send millions of dollars between network participants.
