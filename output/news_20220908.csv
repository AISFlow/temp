42394813,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVeKW,1662680495,Crypto Influencer Cooper Turley Creates $10M ‘Coop Records’ Music Startup Fund,"Cryptocurrency influencer and non-fungible token (NFT) song collector Cooper Turley is spinning up a $10 million fund to invest in artists and startup founders bringing crypto and music together.  His so-called Coop Records – backed by crypto culture influence brokers from Audius to OpenSea – will seek to solve what Turley sees as a big problem in the modern music industry: Labels and streaming services hold all the power and artists lack autonomy over their creative work.  Turley’s trying to change that with non-fungible tokens.  “The biggest word I think of when it comes to Web3 is ownership. So, if you create value for a network, you should be able to capture that value in the form of a token or some sort of NFT,” Turley told CoinDesk in a phone call.  Coop Records will take that notion of ownership and apply it across the music development stack. In a blog post announcing the fund, Turley wrote of a future where artists can raise money and profit off their work without selling their songs to a record label – perhaps by instead selling ownership of their music-creating company in tokenized form.  In a Twitter thread Thursday, Turley said that his fund will act as an incubator, venture capital firm and record label all in one, supporting artists in making profitable Web3 technologies of their work. Its “Artist Seed Rounds” will help artists find funders who believe in their work.  His vision for the future of Web3 and music is one where artists can create viable fan communities around their careers.  “There's never really been a way for me to see collective ownership over that artist's success,” said Turley, speaking of “a way for me to kind of have that sort of proof-of-fandom asset that represents some exposure to that artist's career.”  The fund launch is the latest turn by a man deeply embedded in crypto’s cultural scene. In addition to being a prolific investor in crypto music startups, Turley was a co-founder and key promoter of the online social club Friends With Benefits DAO. He was removed from the organization in January after racist tweets from years earlier surfaced.

A new filing registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday listed Yang and his former presidential campaign manager, Zach Graumann, among the directors and executive officers for a company called Samarity Inc.  A trademark filing reveals that Samarity will, in part, promote “the charities of others by means of the issuance, custody and settlement of cryptocurrency to volunteers in exchange for participation in charitable service.”  According to the SEC filing, Samarity had sold $1 million in an equity offering with a $1.5 million target. The offering also covers options, warrants or other rights to acquire another security. Sales for the offering began on Aug. 25 and the capital raised to date has come from one investor. Graumann is listed as the chief executive officer of Samarity.  Yang did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Graumann declined to comment.  Yang ran as a Democratic presidential nominee during the 2020 election and also made an unsuccessful bid for New York City mayor last year. Graumann was formerly the client philanthropy director at UBS Wealth Management before serving as Yang’s presidential campaign manager.  The two men met when Yang served as an adviser for SuitUp, a Graumann-founded nonprofit that connects corporations with schools for volunteer opportunities.  A person named Adam Sloan was listed as the third executive officer and director of Samarity.  Earlier this year, Yang launched Lobby3, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that advocates for Web3 policies in Washington, D.C.

Celsius filed for bankruptcy earlier this summer, but has laid out a proposal by which a still-being-built mining enterprise will allow it to generate enough revenue to continue operations. However, the U.S. Trustee's office – a Department of Justice entity tasked with monitoring bankruptcies – filed last month to appoint an independent examiner to investigate the company, saying its leadership had not been transparent about the actual financials.  While some of Celsius' borrowers have opposed the move, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors and attorneys for Celsius said in separate filings Thursday that they had agreed to the appointment, so long as the examiner's scope was narrowed to limit the cost and time of the investigation. The U.S. Trustee's office has agreed to these limitations as well, the committee's filing said.  A proposed order filed alongside the parties' statements suggests the scope should be limited to examining Celsius' crypto holdings, where the crypto holdings are stored, ""whether different types of accounts are commingled""; examining why Celsius changed account offerings from Earn to Custody or ""Withhold Account""; examining Celsius' procedures for paying various taxes and whether it's compliant with certain laws; examining the mining business; and any other relevant tasks.  The proposed order also suggests that any examiner create a budget and proposal that would be subject to court approval.  ""The Agreed Proposed Order does not resolve all matters related to the appointment of an examiner. For example, the Agreed Proposed Order does not specify the identity of the examiner, whom the Committee expects the U.S. Trustee to select in consultation with and following input from the Committee,"" the committee's filing said.

42394816,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVeNT,1662670457,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Up Slightly Despite Fed Chairman's Hawkish Comments,"Price Action  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) rose in Thursday trading along with traditional risky assets after hawkish comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell mixed with better-than-expected jobs data increased the probability of tighter monetary policy.  During a question-and-answer session held by the Cato Institute on Thursday, Powell reiterated the Fed’s commitment to stemming inflation, which increased expectations for a 75 basis points rate hike in September.  Bitcoin rose 0.4% despite Powell’s hawkish comments. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap traded lower the hour prior to Powell’s comments, but reversed course in the hours following. BTC’s daily trading volume was slightly below average when compared to its 20-day moving average of volume.  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was 0.94% higher on the day, on above-average volume. ETH also fell before Powell’s comments and rose after them. ETH’s 30-day correlation to BTC remains strong, at 0.9.  A White House report on Thursday stated that the environmental impact of mining digital assets like bitcoin “could impede U.S. efforts to combat climate change.” The report appears to be a precursor to additional studies on the impact of crypto mining on the environment.  BTC traded down slightly following the release of the report, as did ETH, despite the upcoming Merge, the Ethereum blockchain’s shift from a proof-of-work method of maintaining its network to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake way.  Economic Calendar: Initial jobless claims for the week ended Sept. 3 were 222,000, versus expectations of 230,000. This marks the fourth consecutive week of declines and brings initial claims to their lowest level since May. The positive jobs data provides the Federal Reserve with more reason to increase interest rates.  U.S. Equities: Traditional financial markets closed higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite increasing 0.6%, 0.7%, and 0.6% respectively.  Commodities: Crude oil futures increased 1.1%, and natural gas futures rose 1.6%. The price of gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, declined 0.54%  Currencies: The dollar index (DXY) rose 0.10%.  Altcoins rose, as polkadot (DOT), solana (SOL) and AAVE increased 2.6%, 2.7% and 0.8%, respectively.  Latest Prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $19,373 +0.9%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,647 +1.0%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,006.18 +0.7%      ●Gold: $1,719 per troy ounce +0.2%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.29% +0.03      Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  BTC and ETH Trade at Different Technical Levels  Although BTC and ETH prices have moved largely in sync, they possess different levels of support and resistance.  According to the volume profile visible range (VPVR), BTC is trading below resistance, while ETH appears to be trading above support. VPVR displays trading activity across various price levels over a specific period of time. In the chart below, prices were viewed as of Jan 1.  The price point where the highest levels of volume occur is the point of control and represents areas of substantial activity and agreement on price.  Assets that trade below their point of control will often find resistance as they approach the higher price point. Conversely, assets trading above their point of control will often find support at the lower price point.  CoinDesk’s chart highlights BTC trading at an approximately 10% discount to its $21,400 point of control, while ETH is trading at a 42% premium to its point of control of $1,147. ETH also appears to be generating strong volume at its current price point, signaling a move higher in ETH support.  The divergence implies a distinction in the narrative between the two largest cryptocurrencies. While BTC appears to be the more undervalued of the two, the connection to macroeconomic hurdles has placed a short-term lid on its price.  Wednesday’s Market Wrap highlighted the inverse relationship between U.S. dollar strength and the price of bitcoin. As that relationship continues, actions that push the value of USD higher are likely to have a negative impact on bitcoin's price.  ETH, meanwhile, appears to be benefiting from the upcoming Merge. Investors appear to be viewing the software update as a catalyst that at least partly overcomes hurdles related to inflation and economic growth.  The ETH/BTC currency pair is up 60% since July, highlighting the difference in performance between the two assets.

42411742,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfXrc,1662668965,What Is Sudoswap? How to Use the NFT Marketplace,"Trading NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, on centralized marketplaces like OpenSea or Rarible can be painfully slow and unpredictable. When you want to sell an NFT, there may be no buyers. When you want to buy an NFT, the one you want may not be listed for sale or the offer you place on it may elicit no interest. This is unlike trading fungible decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, where you can always buy and sell crypto.  Sudoswap, a decentralized NFT marketplace, aims to bring that familiar Uniswap experience to NFTs. It offers a platform where users can create and trade through liquidity pools, which are smart contract containers that consist of NFTs and ether (ETH).  But the whole idea may sound counter-intuitive; after all, each NFT is unique, making them – as the name suggests – non-fungible. How can you throw them all into a liquidity pool, as if they were fungible shiba inu tokens? Well, that’s left up to users to decide whether they want to trade NFTs that way – its popularity so far bodes well for the platform.  What is Sudoswap?  Sudoswap is a decentralized NFT marketplace on the Ethereum network, and it operates in a radically different way compared to other NFT marketplaces.  On OpenSea you trade NFTs with other people through an off-chain order book model. But on Sudoswap you buy and sell NFTs through liquidity pools, which are pieces of code on the blockchain that contain tokens. Users can deposit NFTs or ETH into Sudoswap’s pools and earn fees from trades that take place through these pools.  Read more: What Are Liquidity Pools?  The main advantage of Sudoswap is that there’s always liquidity if there’s a pool for your NFT collection, so you can immediately sell your NFT into a pool and receive ETH. That said, you may not always get the price you’d like, so it may not be an ideal option for super-rare, high-priced NFTs.  The reason behind this is because the price of NFTs changes in proportion to how many NFTs are left in the pool – basically, it’s simple supply and demand calculations. For users experienced with decentralized exchanges, these mechanics should feel familiar, but it is a very different experience for those who are used to NFT marketplaces like OpenSea where you can set the sale price.  Each NFT collection on Sudoswap may have multiple pools with different specifications – all created by users. One specification is “bonding curve,” which is essentially a mathematical formula that determines how the price of NFTs in that pool will change after each sell or buy.  Let’s unpack these mechanics further.  How do Sudoswap’s pools and bonding curves work?  Three types of liquidity pools on Sudoswap:  Buy-only pools  Sell-only pools  Buy-and-sell pools  And these pools may have either of the following bonding curves:  Linear curve: the price increases or decreases linearly as buys and sells happen  Exponential curve: the price increases or decreases by X% as buys and sells happen  A buy-only pool structured linearly may buy its first NFT for 3 ETH, then 2 ETH, then 1 ETH  A sell-only pool structured exponentially will sell its NFTs at a certain percentage increase. The example below shows a pool where the price increases exponentially by 7% after each sale.  A pool will look like this, with all specifications indicated:  Sudoswap fees are generally low. There's a 0.5% fee on trades unlike OpenSea’s 2.5%. But pool creators can set swap fees that will be paid to them (as in the example above).  Controversially, Sudoswap bypasses project royalties, which are fees paid to NFT creators on other marketplaces for secondary sales and beyond. For example, on OpenSea the original creator or artist of an NFT might get 5% of any resales in perpetuity. This allows the original creators to benefit from their work growing in value, unlike in the traditional art market. Sudoswap removes this creator benefit to the gain of the owners and traders.  How do you buy an NFT on Sudowap?  To buy or sell an NFT on Sudoswap, simply go to sudoswap.xyz and click “connect” on the top right to connect your crypto wallet.  Then scroll down and click “view all collections.”  Select the NFT collection you want to trade, and you’ll be taken to the collection’s page:  There are two ways to buy. The simplest way is just to buy directly at listed prices. Let’s cover that one first.  Click “view item” for the NFT you like, and it’ll take you to the individual NFT page.     Just click to “buy now” and confirm the transaction on the MetaMask pop-up that will appear. That's the whole easy process.  Alternatively, you can make a collection offer, which would require you to create a pool with the specifications you indicate, as seen below. Click “make collection offer” on the main collection page.  With a collection offer, you can buy multiple NFTs and indicate by what percentage your price should indicate after someone sells you an NFT.  How do you create a liquidity pool on SudoSwap?  More experienced DeFi users may want to create a liquidity pool on Sudoswap and earn trading fees, similar to liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges like Sushiswap.  Click “your pools” on the top right of the screen. You will have three options, as explained earlier.  After you select the pool you want to create, Sudoswap will walk you through the process, asking you to indicate how much ETH and how many NFTs you want to deposit.  In the next screen, you’ll select a bonding curve – exponential or linear – and indicate what you’re depositing to set up the pool, for example 6 ETH and two Pudgy Penguin NFTs.  The SUDO token  Sudoswap has plans to decentralize governance through tokenization. In December 2021, project co-founder 0xmons confirmed Sudoswap would have a token called SUDO, and in September 2022 the project announced it would release its token via airdrop, primarily to holders of XMON, which is the native token behind the 0xmon NFT collection that was also created by the founders of Sudoswap.  The project’s document states the token would be non-transferable until the launch of on-chain governance.",NEUTRAL,ETH,ETH | MINING | SHIB | TRADING | ZRX,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-sudoswap-how-to-use-the-nft-marketplace,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60415bf95b2d6ea1907d5a333191ad3fbc7b3128-679x413.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394810,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVeGa,1662667350,US Treasury to Recommend Issuing Digital Dollar if in National Interest: Source,"The U.S. Treasury Department will advise the federal government to press forward on work to issue a digital dollar, though it should only take the final step if there’s sign-off that the government-created tokens are in the “national interest,” according to a person familiar with a report emerging soon.  The question of national interest will depend on further approval of the Biden administration and – potentially – action by Congress, said the person, who requested anonymity because the Treasury’s “Future of Money” report hasn’t yet been released. This national-interest decision is made murkier by the question of whether U.S. legislators need to pass a law to authorize the Federal Reserve to create a central bank digital currency (CBDC) – a question that may be answered soon in a separate analysis.  President Joe Biden’s executive order this past March called for crypto recommendations from several corners of the federal government, and many of those reports have come due. The Treasury’s document on how to handle the question of a digital dollar – expected to be released in the coming days – is among the most eagerly awaited, because issuing such a token could upend the digital assets industry and have major implications for consumers’ relationships with traditional banks.  A spokesman with the Treasury Department declined to comment on the report.  Still, the final decision on issuing a CBDC belongs with the Fed board, and Chair Jerome Powell – along with other senior Fed officials – has repeatedly stated the central bank won’t move without support from the administration and Congress. So far, the Fed has been reticent to clarify what congressional approval needs to look like, despite Republicans’ best efforts to dig out a response.  The Department of Justice may soon answer whether the project requires the backing of a new law when it issues its own crypto report. If Justice says the president is the only one who needs to decide whether a CBDC is in the country’s best interest, Powell and the board will have a choice to make: What signal of support do they need from Congress?  While the “Future of Money” report won’t explicitly provide an administration endorsement for the digital dollar, it will suggest potential ideas for how it could be designed, the person said. It will also highlight work being done on a government real-time payments system expected to begin next year, which may take some pressure off the CBDC decision.  Long-term project  Though other nations – such as China – have moved ahead with CBDCs, President Biden hasn’t yet made his view known on whether he’d favor issuing a government token.  Even if Biden, Congress and the Fed eventually decide to put out a digital dollar, it could take as much as five years to design and launch one, according to Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard. That would give the crypto industry a long time to establish private stablecoins as an alternative for users. Fed officials have said they believe there would be room for the private sector to operate dollar-pegged cryptos alongside a public token.  The industry inadvertently shoveled some fuel into the CBDC fire this year when one of the largest stablecoins – algorithmic terraUSD (UST) – imploded and sent damaging shockwaves through the rest of the crypto infrastructure. Since then, regulators and lawmakers have been wary of stablecoins, which are meant to be the steadiest part of the crypto market because of their ties to underlying assets such as the dollar.  CBDCs have also been praised as a possible solution for widening financial access to consumers who don’t, or can’t, use banks.  “Unlike private digital assets, a CBDC issued by the Federal Reserve would be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, like the dollar bills in our wallets,” said Rep. Maxine Waters, (D-Calif.), the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, in a statement earlier this year. She said a digital dollar could “hold the promise of deepening financial inclusion for underserved communities as more economic activity moves online.”  Fed officials have assured the wider financial industry that it would still have the role of managing customers’ digital dollars, and that the central bank wouldn’t have direct digital accounts for consumers.  To date, Biden’s executive order has produced three reports – including one on Thursday that focused on crypto’s environmental record. That document made a splash because it called for environmental standards for the industry and suggested that a failure to improve could lead to recommendations that crypto’s proof-of-work mining be limited or even banned.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/08/us-treasury-to-recommend-issuing-digital-dollar-if-in-national-interest-source,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dfdca5a952e4f0ee61f207382f30d5dad70cb93b-3043x2369.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411372,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNQCg,1662667155,It’s Time to End Maximalism in Crypto,"“You’ve got a bunch of s**tcoins listed in your bio, why should anyone listen to you?” the self-proclaimed “Bitcoin maxi” once said to me. I muted my microphone and sat back stunned as I listened to the rest of his tirade.  Up until that point, I had been engaged in a constructive conversation on Twitter spaces with a number of bitcoin (BTC) investors and about 300 people listening on how to solve problems such as price volatility and privacy.  As a BTC holder myself, the conversation had been civil to start but quickly turned hostile when I brought up another blockchain project.  Alex Valaitis is the strategic advisor for the DeSo Foundation and author of the Web3 Pills newsletter.  What I experienced on Twitter spaces that night is an example of a concerning trend in the wider Web3 space known as “maximalism.” Crypto is composed of both technological and investable opportunities, a combination that breeds fanaticism.  The term “maximalism” was originally used to describe “Bitcoin maximalists” i.e., individuals who believe that bitcoin is the only blockchain-based digital asset that will be needed in the future (while also believing that all other alternatives are useless).  Read more: You Can Be a Bitcoin Maximalist and Like Ethereum, Too / Opinion  As new layer 1 blockchains have popped up, we’ve seen the concept of maximalism shift to include individuals that believe their prefered chain (and only their chain) is the future of digital finance or web infrastructure. This includes niche maximalists such as smart contract or EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) maximalists, as well as more specific maximalists, such as Ethereum or Cardano maximalists.  While it is not only acceptable but also important to have strong convictions when operating in an emerging industry, many participants cross the line in their attacks on other projects, often at the expense of the entire space.  The perils of maximalism  Advocates for maximalism will argue they are defending non-negotiable principles that exist in one chain or community but not another. This includes debates around decentralization, security and privacy.  However, what many of these folks fail to recognize is that technical solutions are often a question of trade-offs. What makes one blockchain excel on one dimension is precisely what makes it falter on another.  Bitcoin is extremely secure and decentralized. However, its settlement layer is fundamentally constrained in terms of the types of use cases and volume of transactions that it can support.  Solana is extremely fast and cheap but has been subject to network outages (something that Bitcoin has never had) and questions around centralization at the consensus level.  Read more: Bitcoin Maximalist Michael Saylor Makes the Case Against Ethereum  It would serve in the best interest of builders to explore all options and relentlessly build towards the path they have the most conviction in. Ultimately, it should be up to social consensus, i.e., the billions of people on the internet, to decide which models will win.  However, there’s recently been a war on new ideas and nuanced approaches in the Web3 space. Whether it’s well-known BTC maximalist Michael Saylor openly calling ether (ETH) a security or a lawyer bragging about suing competitor crypto projects while secretly being recorded, individuals are resorting to below-the-belt tactics to ensure their blockchain of choice wins.  The end result of this behavior is that many outsiders begin to view the wider crypto space as toxic and unwelcoming. More concerning, it can open the door for regulators to come in and overstep. Today it’s your competitor being shut down, tomorrow it very well might be you.  A better path forward  Despite some of the negative trends around maximalism, there has been a positive countertrend. Many participants are actively supporting multiple different blockchain projects who are taking radically different approaches.  This group of people believe in a “multi-chain future” or a future in which a large volume of transactions will be settled on a number of different blockchains as opposed to just one.  In fact, many of the people leading this charge are crypto projects themselves such as Cosmos with its Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC) or Chainlink with the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).  Even non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces are deciding to get in on the cross-chain action. Renowned NFT marketplace Magic Eden made waves when it recently announced that it would be expanding beyond Solana to Ethereum.  Gone are the days in which NFT collectors only buy NFTs on one blockchain.  Read more: NFT Exchange Magic Eden Expands to Ethereum  Raising all ships  It’s understandable that people get defensive about their blockchain project, considering many have not only put in time and energy but also money. The crypto space is still largely speculative, so there are perverse incentives for investors to “shill their bags.”  However, it doesn’t have to be this way. If we can collectively change our mindset to a “raise all ships” model, it will end up benefiting everyone in the long term.  Today, crypto and Web3 are still in their infancy. Only 300 million people have used cryptocurrency and the top dapps (decentralized applications) on Ethereum almost all have less than 10,000 daily active users.  Contrast this with the billions of people who use social media and the internet daily, and it’s clear how much room this industry has to grow.

42411084,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC02W,1662666552,Crypto Fantasy Football Is Here,"If you spend enough time in crypto, you’re bound to hear a well-worn cliche: “The space is so young, it’s like we’re in the early 1990s' internet.” Back then, according to this logic, the average person couldn’t see past the clunky interface of TCP/IP, and only a few bold dreamers could envision a world of e-commerce, global interconnectivity and stupid cat videos.  Allow me to introduce a fresher analogy: Crypto is now in the early ‘90s' version of fantasy football. I know because I was there. When I was a high school nerd in 1992, pre-internet, I read a magazine about this strange new concept and I convinced my friends to try it. No one else understood what we were doing. We were ahead of the Dork Curve. I used actual newspapers – they once came in print – to manually tabulate scores. My friends and I were obsessed, and I had a hunch that the world would eventually catch up.  Read more: NFL All Day 101: How to Buy, Sell and Trade NFL NFTs  Flash forward 30 years. The dorky fringe became the mainstream, and fantasy sports is now a $22 billion market. It turns out that fantasy football was sneaky-good at more than just enriching the National Football League experience: It helped build communities. Friends gathered for drafts. They talked trash. They punished each other with 15-hour trips to the Waffle House.  The point is that crypto and fantasy football are more alike than you would think – goofy-sounding interests that some find enthralling and others find off-putting. (And they’re both, of course, packed with bros.) So it felt like only a matter of time until a merger of crypto and fantasy football. That already started with the more global version of football, soccer, as I learned when reporting on the thriving ecosystem of Sorare. An NFL version seemed like a lock.  Keeping it simple  Enter DraftKings (the sports fantasy and gambling behemoth), and enter The Owners Club, a crypto fantasy football game co-founded by Justin Herzig, who had previously launched an NBA Top Shot analytics project called Own the Moment.  “This was built by fantasy players for fantasy players, with a ‘normie’-focused approach,” says Herzig, who adds that the goal was to minimize the appearance of blockchain technology, because “you had to make it simple, and you had to make it fun.”  The Owners Club (TOC) launched in 2021 for its beta season, and this week, it's kicking off Year 2. Here’s how it works. You buy a pack of five cards, and each card has a city and a “position group.” So your card might be “Tampa Bay Quarterbacks” or “Dallas Cowboys Running Backs.” This is an almost shockingly different format from traditional fantasy football, where you simply draft Tom Brady, not “Tampa Bay Quarterbacks.”  Herzig wanted to keep it simple. “There are no concerns about injuries. No concerns about your running back getting vultured,” Herzig says. “We found this is a far more fun gameplay. It’s less of a grind.”  Crypto is now in the early ‘90s version of fantasy football  There are five position groups: quarterbacks, running backs, wide receivers, tight ends and defense. (The kickers have been booted.) Each week, you submit a five-card lineup into a weekly contest. The better your lineup does, the more prize money you can win. (Two thousand players entered TOC’s inaugural season, Herzig said, winning a combined $1.5 million.)  The odds are that when you open your first pack, you’re probably going to be happy with only one or two of your cards. You might get a dud. So you can upgrade your squad by buying and selling these NFTs in the marketplace, and the value of these non-fungible tokens can (and likely will) change over time.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - The Degens' Sports Club  “It’s a liquid market,” explains Mark Poskarbiewicz, a 36-year-old corporate finance analyst who played in TOC’s first season. “The market is pretty abundant with options.”  The concept of “market liquidity’ might sound weedy and arcane, but for those who have played in the same fantasy football league for years, this can be a big deal. I’s one of the features that makes me bullish on the long-term potential of crypto fantasy football.  In my own fantasy football league, for example, we rarely do any actual trading. It just doesn’t happen. (I blame the behavioral economics theory of “loss aversion,” where people are irrationally reluctant to part with their assets and get embarrassed in front of their friends.)  True, you can improve your team on the margins on the waiver wire, but once you draft your team you’re more or less stuck. True shake-ups are rare. The wheeling and dealing of TOC’s NFT marketplace, in contrast, lets players like Poskarbiewicz stay more engaged and feel like frisky general managers.  Poskarbiewicz ended up winning Week 1 in 2021, and he was later flown by TOC (along with other winners) to Miami for the final weekly battle of the season at the FTX Arena (of course) . He hauled in around $5,000 over the season, but the main perk was less about the money and more about the ease and enjoyment of play.  “One of my first complaints of daily fantasy sports is that you need a stats degree,” Poskarbiewicz says.  Not cheap  Poskarbiewicz is disenchanted by the spreadsheets and data science required for leagues like FanDuel and DraftKings, where the “whales” can dominate. He thinks TOC brought the game back to fantasy football basics, and felt like more of an “everyman’s league.”  That last point is debatable. In 2021, the starting five-pack cost $200, and Herzig says the average player spent $1,000 when factoring in their upgrades. That’s an order of magnitude above the typical fantasy football buy-in of $100 to $200. (This year the price of a five-pack drops to $100, and a separate game called “Best Ball” has packs for $10; it’s unclear if that cheaper game will hold the same appeal.)  And TOC will now face competition. This year a new project called “League DAO” is launching its own version of crypto fantasy football, where “on-chain scoring is based on real-world stats.” Meanwhile, one of the juggernauts of the traditional fantasy football space, DraftKings, is quietly rolling out NFT-injected fantasy football, called Reignmakers.  Unlike TOC, DraftKings has a licensing agreement in place with NFL players, which allows for an NFT marketplace of player cards. (Here you can get a Tom Brady card.) Similar to the TOC model, you can buy packs of cards (each card is an NFT) and enter contests throughout the season.  You can get a starter pack for free, and then upgrade your roster with $9.99 or $19.99 packs, or splurge on packs that cost $2,000. DraftKings plans to dole out over $30 million in prizes to these NFT games, according to Matt Kalish, co-founder and president of DraftKings North America.  This could mean mass adoption. Even in the game’s infancy, Kalish says there are more than 10,000 transactions per day in the NFT marketplace. That’s only a tiny slice of DraftKings’ 4 million users, but the slice will almost certainly grow.  “This could be hundreds of thousands or millions of users,” says Kalish, who notes that “we don’t have any products that don’t have millions of users.”  Herzig is aware of the stiff competition, and he’s a fan. “I think it’s a great variation of NFT fantasy football,” says Herzig, who sees it as an accelerant to wider adoption. “Our hope is that they’re going to build a great product that’s going to introduce a ton of fantasy football fans into this space.”  I don’t have any insight or predictions about whether The Owners Club, League DAO, DraftKings, Sorare or some other project will emerge as the leading platform for crypto fantasy football. But as a fantasy football nerd who has morphed into a crypto nerd, the marriage feels inevitable. After all, we’re only in the early 1990s.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/08/crypto-fantasy-football-is-here,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/918130028c6cf33550429f936ececac3ab4c8cba-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Joshua David Nicholas, 28, was the “head trader” for EmpiresX, which was launched in late 2020 and was advertised to hopeful investors as a legitimate cryptocurrency trading and investment platform.  Nicholas and EmpiresX’s founders, Emerson Sousa Pires and Flavio Mendes Goncalves, both 33, promised investors that their proprietary artificial intelligence-powered “trading bot” guaranteed returns of up to 1% a day.  However, the bot did not exist, and Nicholas’ manual trading “resulted in significant losses,” according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed civil fraud charges against the group in June. Customers were instead paid with money fed into the scam by later investors. The rest of the money was used to “lease a Lamborghini, shop at Tiffany & Co., make a payment on a second home and more,” the SEC said.  Potential investors were further persuaded by promises that EmpiresX was registered with the SEC as a hedge fund, which the SEC said was untrue.  When the scheme began to collapse earlier this year, Pires and Goncalves allegedly halted customer withdrawals and fled the country for Brazil. Both are Brazilian citizens.  Nicholas pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.  Pires and Goncalves have both been charged with one count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count each of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. They face up to 45 years in prison.

Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio Breached 90% Right Before The Price Dip As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the whale activity on exchanges has been raised recently. The &apos;exchange whale ratio&apos; is an indicator that measures the ratio between the top ten inflow transactions to exchanges and the total exchange inflows. The ten biggest transfers are assumed to be from the whales, so that the metric tells us what part of the total number of coins moving into exchanges is coming from these humungous holders. When the value of this indicator is high, it means a large part of the inflows is coming from whales right now. Such a trend can be a sign of dumping from this cohort and can therefore be bearish for the price. On the other hand, low values of the ratio can suggest whales are making up a healthy part of the transactions to exchanges at the moment.

Is The Composite Man Behind Bitcoin Mark Down? Wyckoff theory is based on the idea that retail traders are regularly outsmarted by large operators he referred to as the Composite Man.

In a complaint filed on Monday, True Names Ltd., the company behind the Web3 domain name service, alleged that GoDaddy not only falsely announced to eth.link users the domain registration had expired, but it also sold the domain off before it was supposed to return to the registry and be available for re-purchase.  Eth.link helped ensure users trying to get to .eth addresses actually could. MetaMask and other Web3-enabled browsers can get to .eth sites without trouble, but traditional browsers cannot. Eth.link provided a bridge. (While old-school browsers can't directly get to, as a hypothetical example, CoinDesk.eth, they could via CoinDesk.eth.link.)  Domain registration renewals are typically straightforward, but in this case the person with the authority to renew the registration for eth.link, Virgil Griffith, is currently serving a 63-month prison sentence for instructing North Koreans on how to use crypto as a way to evade sanctions.  The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, alleges the registration was set to expire on July 26, 2023, but in August GoDaddy falsely announced it had expired on July 26, 2022. According to the filing, GoDaddy had said the domain name would be available for purchase again on Sept. 5, 2022, but it had sold eth.link to a third party, crypto start-up Manifold Finance, on Sept. 3.  ""In so doing, GoDaddy has deprived Plaintiff True Names Ltd. of its livelihood. The sale will disable a valuable cryptocurrency network and recklessly risk making it available to scores of malicious actors,"" the complaint said.  Plaintiffs True Names and Griffith are seeking damages worth at least $75,000 excluding legal costs, and are calling for a temporary restraining order against defendants GoDaddy, Inc., GoDaddy.com LLC and any employees or entities that directly or indirectly allowed eth.link to expire and be available for purchase by third parties.  ENS had two million domain name registrations as of Aug. 17.  The eth.link landing page currently displays a message from new owner Manifold Finance that says services will be restored in the upcoming week. Domain Name Wire reported that Manifold paid $851,919.30 for eth.link.  GoDaddy declined to comment on ongoing litigation.

But the crypto market crash has made some Cardano investors bearish. Tamadoge is a new NFT game that investors are bullish on because of its utility and rewards. Can Cardano Drop Lower? Crypto bear markets can be brutal, and Cardano (ADA) investors watched the coin lose 87% of its value after reaching an all-time high of $3 in August 2021. But many investors are wondering, can ADA go lower? Cardano Rallies ADA has provided investors with 7,000% returns because of a rally that started at the end of 2017 and lasted until the beginning of 2018. And just recently, Cardano had another rally at the beginning of 2021, climbing up just over 1,600%. If that wasn&apos;t enough, ADA retraced and then went for another run to reach its all-time high. Since then, ADA buyers have run out of steam and the crypto bears have taken over. Although ADA has lost 87% of its value, it&apos;s possible that it can lose more. After Ethereum and Bitcoin topped out during the 2018 rally, both of these top cryptocurrencies lost just over 90% of their value in the subsequent years. So it&apos;s possible that ADA can dip lower before it starts climbing up again. Bearish Market Sentiment It&apos;s not easy for investors to watch several red candles a few weeks in a row.

We&apos;ve identified 5 cryptos that could explode as a result of this upgrade to the blockchain. 5 Cryptos Exploding After the ETH Merge 1. Tamadoge Ethereum&apos;s network has been used by many NFT projects, and that&apos;s one of the reasons that Tamadoge could directly benefit. Tamadoge is an NFT game, enabling players to earn rewards while grooming their digital pets. Pet owners that look after their pets the most climb the leaderboard and get rewarded with TAMA tokens. Another benefit of owning the TAMA coin is that it&apos;s a deflationary token, so the developers burn 5% of all coins spent on the platform. It&apos;s already shown to be an exploding crypto during its presale, having raised more than $4 million in a few weeks since the launch. But even more good news for the Tamadoge cryptocurrency is that it will be listed on LBank soon. A Uniswap listing for the TAMA coin is also in the pipeline. The exposure that it will get from being listed on centralized and decentralized exchanges will increase its demand and make it one of the cryptos with the most potential.

42411373,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNQFz,1662657308,Why DeFi Protocols Are Limiting ETH Borrowing Ahead of Ethereum’s Merge,"The upcoming Merge – when Ethereum will undergo the most complicated upgrade in blockchain history – is already creating opportunities for those predicting it could have a positive impact on ether’s (ETH) price. ETH, at around $1,600, is setting fresh yearly highs ahead of the event scheduled for next week.  ETH is trading at its highest price relative to bitcoin (BTC) this year, and also sucking the oxygen from other layer 1 blockchains. At least part of the reason, analysts said, are the many proposed tokens to be airdropped to ETH holders after the transition is completed – a free subsidy that people can either choose to hold or sell.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Several decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are now setting limits around ETH lending, as speculators load up on the asset in anticipation of a potential windfall. Compound users, for instance, today passed a vote to set a borrow cap of 100,000 ETH and increased interest rates for large borrowers.  “The upcoming [Merge] has the potential to cause disruption to ETH lending markets due to the possibility of receiving airdrops of ETH fork tokens. This may incentivize excessive borrowing from ETH lending pools, which leads to negative user experience for depositors who cannot withdraw funds,” the proposal read.  This comes a week after Aave, another “blue chip” DeFi lender, voted to temporarily ban ETH lending after users predicted the Merge could cause a surge in demand that would severely interfere with the protocol’s programmatic trading protections.  See also: Aave Companies Seeks $16M From DAO to Fund Development  The risks for both protocols, Compound and Aave, and perhaps other DeFi lenders, are similar: Airdrop speculators could suction up ETH deposits thereby creating liquidity constraints for other users. Indeed, other DeFi protocols are seeing users swap out ETH-derivatives, like Lido’s staked ETH (stETH), which won’t receive airdrops and is now trading at a significant discount, for ETH, which will.  In Compound’s proposal, users note that “the vast majority of non-ETH assets are likely to become worthless on fork chains” – perhaps including the airdrop with the most eyes on it, ETHPOW – because there is such a high degree of consensus that switching to PoS is beneficial. But the short-term trade is attractive for many, and these alternative ETH varieties could still retain value.  For some, such limits placed around “open finance” seem antithetical to aims of DeFi – an example of a group of people overriding the code meant to create fairer trading conditions for all. This is especially true considering how concentrated DeFi voting is among large token holders today.  See also: Market for Compound Ether Token 'Frozen' After Code Bug  But these precautionary moves might also prove the value and viability of distributed protocol governance, protecting the long-term health of DeFi against shortsighted, individually-motivated traders.

42393791,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAzip,1662657178,Air Gap? Hardware Wallet? Multisig? Bitcoin Self-Storage Means Hard Choices,"Bitcoin (BTC) security is hard to get right: Any form of offline, or “cold” storage available today has trade-offs. Which one is the most secure is still a matter of debate between bitcoin software developers and wallet makers.  Self-sovereign money comes with responsibility. Experienced bitcoiners would tell you: It’s not enough to just buy bitcoin – to really start your trip to financial autonomy, you need to be in full control of your cryptographic private keys, meaning your bitcoin should sit on your own device.  However, choosing a device to store your bitcoin is an endeavor on its own. Over recent years, companies working in this field came up with a variety of options, all of which have pros and cons.  The easiest thing to start with is to download a software wallet, or an app generating keys for your bitcoin on your phone or laptop. But phones and computers get stolen or lost, they break and can be infected by malware. The young hardware wallet industry offers a different solution: a small device that is designed to hold bitcoin keys in its memory and sign transactions, with no other features and no persistent internet connection.  However, what the best solution is for an average bitcoiner is still debatable. Some of those arguments came up during a panel at the bitcoin-only Baltic Honeybadger conference in Riga, Latvia, this past weekend.  Below are some highlights.  Tricky hardware  Pavol Rusnak, CEO of hardware wallet maker Trezor, argued a product like the one his company makes is the most secure way to store bitcoin because it has a “limited attack surface.”  “It’s a less-complex hardware, and the software is not as complex as Windows or MacOS or Android. And it’s offline most of the time,” Rusnak told CoinDesk, adding that “most of the attacks are remote attacks using malware, and that’s what the hardware wallet protects you from.”  Speaking on a panel on bitcoin security, cryptography consultant Peter Todd disagreed with this approach, saying he does not use hardware wallets: “I’d rather use a laptop, as it’s unlikely it would be specifically targeted, and put [the laptop] in a safe box.”  Hardware wallets, which you usually order via the internet and get shipped to your home, might put a target on your back as a bitcoin holder. Using a laptop, people might never know, Todd explained talking to CoinDesk off-stage.  Also, the factories manufacturing hardware wallets might become the target of a supply chain attack, he added. Someone could tamper with the devices and redesign them to steal bitcoin from users.  Therefore, “My advice to a lot of people is get a phone, get your hardware wallet on it and don’t use it for anything else. Your phone isn’t a target. The supply chain of your phone is not a target,” Todd said.  An ideal setup would be using a multi-signature wallet, when you use several devices in your possession to sign every transaction spending your bitcoin, Todd said. However, at the moment “the software stack for multisig technology isn’t very good and not easy to use.”  Ultimately, there is no way for a regular person to check whether the device being used is working as claimed, Todd said on stage. “Have I personally ever bothered getting my Trezor, which I don’t use for various reasons, and actually doing all the work to verify that it works the way it claims? No, it’s a whole bunch of work, and chances are it doesn’t work,” he said.  It gets worse, he added: If a wallet uses open-source software – meaning, its code is published on the internet – you might be able to verify that code, but then there are compilers – another type of software that turns high-level code into machine language that a regular computer can understand – which is even harder to verify.  “These systems are so insanely complex,” Todd said, adding that these compilers are like “gigantic factories” of code, very difficult to go through and usually not all parts of the compilers’ code are open source.  To air-gap or not to air-gap  Another controversial question is how the hardware wallets should talk to other devices.  To receive information about a transaction it’s about to sign, a hardware wallet must at some point be connected to an internet-connected device, a laptop or mobile phone. They can connect via a wire with a USB port, a microSD memory card or communicate via QR codes that a wallet generates for a phone camera to read.  Some hardware wallet manufacturers make a point of avoiding a wire connection between a wallet and a computer, so they have an air gap – a security feature where a device is never connected to the internet.  “Transferring electronic information physically, such as through a MicroSD card, rather than through a computer network, will greatly reduce the possibility of synchronous attacks,” said Rodolfo Novak, co-founder and CEO of Coinkite, manufacturer of the Coldcard hardware wallet, in an email to CoinDesk. (Coinkite did not present at the Riga conference.).  “With USB, attackers have direct access to hardware, making remote attacks easier. The fact that the computer's operating system has to pick the correct driver for USB devices based on their serial numbers creates an anonymity problem for devices like Trezor whose data clearly includes a serial number at boot,” Novak explained, adding that “any malicious actors who may have penetrated your computer's internet connection may have access to your keys if you are connected by USB.”  By exposing the wallet’s existence and unique serial number on the internet, a USB connection makes it vulnerable, Novak said. With a micro-SD card, on the contrary, no crucial information is being compromised when a live internet connection is involved, he added.  However, the participants of the Baltic Honeybadger panel disagreed that an SD card is safer than a USB cord.  “The wire between your wallet and your computer isn’t necessarily a bad thing,” Todd said onstage. “The question is how you design that wire, how much current, how many electrons, literally, per second, are flowing through that wire and how fast can that number change.”  He added that modern SD cards used for air-gapped versions of wallets are not such simple devices as they seem: an SD card is “an entire 32-bit microprocessor.”  Rusnak, of Trezor, echoed the idea. “SD cards these days use more computing power than my first computer,” he said. “I’m more afraid this SD card might exfiltrate some data from my computer.”  Novak disagrees. “A MicroSD attack is harder to accomplish compared to a USB attack by a factor of several orders of magnitude,” he told CoinDesk, adding that the microSD cards Coldcard provides with its wallets use “a much reduced amount of code,” compared to the USB, “which makes it easy to audit for exploitable bugs.”  Ultimately, anything can be hacked.  “The job of a hardware wallet manufacturer is to make it not worth the attacker’s time, too costly in terms of time or money,” said Douglas Bakkum, the founder of a hardware wallet firm BitBox.  There are several levels at which hardware wallets can be attacked, Bakkum explained in his presentation, which repeated points made in a company blog post from October: Attacks on the communication layer (meaning, the protocol connecting a wallet to a laptop, be it USB port, QR code or SD card, is compromised), the logic layer (malicious software is injected) and physical layer (attacker breaks open the device, attach probes and tampers with it).  A supply-chain attack threat can hit both for USB-connected devices and SD cards, said Rusnak.  “If there is an attacker that wants to attack you through USB they might as well give you an SD card that is somehow malicious. If your attacker is a regular thief that’s not an issue, and if the attacker is the FBI or some other federal agency, even an SD card won’t help you,” he told CoinDesk.  “You need to draw a line in the sand somewhere when you go down the rabbit hole where you can not trust anything,” Rusnak said.  Bigger picture  When securing your bitcoin, it’s important not to make things too complex for yourself, Rusnak said. People who choose to design a complex security setup for their bitcoin storage, for example, writing their seed phrase (a key to recovering a lost wallet) in the wrong order, might “shoot themselves in a foot” if they either forget the correct order or their heirs aren’t able to reconstruct it.  “Your setup should be usable even in 10 years time, in 15 years time,” Rusnak said onstage, recommending that users always document their security building processes for the future.  “Just don’t trust your brain,” Bakkum echoed.  Rigel Walshe, former police officer in New Zealand and now a developer at Swan Bitcoin, a California-based company that helps clients save in bitcoin, reminded the audience that no matter what technical solution is used, it’s important to take care of your physical safety – meaning, don’t let people know where you (and your bitcoins) are located.  For example, you can use a post office box or even an LLC company for a mailing address to shield your actual location; even your utility bills can be sent to an address other than where you actually are, Walshe said. In this case, even if people find your personal information on the internet, they still won’t be able to get you (and your bitcoin).  “Assume that your information will be doxxed and it will be out there,” Walshe said.  Talking to CoinDesk, Todd mentioned another possible security factor, taking a shot at the Ethereum blockchain, which hardcore bitcoiners consider a worse technology.  “Because ecosystems like Ethereum exist, where security is terrible, bitcoiners aren’t actually that much at risk as they could be,” Todd said. “If you’re a bad guy and know how to crack stuff, what would you focus on? You’re going to focus on stealing from [decentralized finance], which is easier than stealing bitcoin. It keeps hackers away from us.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/08/air-gap-hardware-wallet-multisig-bitcoin-self-storage-means-hard-choices,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92d3859d23fe26de12725ddf8a4ec492d39725a5-1056x772.gif?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

LUNC gained 22% in the past 24 hours, and doubled its price in a week, according to data by crypto intelligence platform Messari. Still, the token is changing hands at a fraction of a cent ($0.00052 to be precise) and it is down more than 99.99% since the start of the year.  A “tax burn” regime that aims to reduce the token’s hyperinflated supply is likely fueling the rally.  The community approved a proposal that introduces a 1.2% tax rate on every transaction on the blockchain. According to the proposal, the “tax” will automatically be sent to a wallet to destroy (burn) the tokens to bring down gradually LUNC’s bloated circulating supply. The fee rate is expected to take effect on Sept. 20, according to a statement from Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume.  The rate cannot be enforced on trading the token on centralized exchanges, as a member of the Terra governance forum pointed out, but some exchanges such as MEXC will voluntarily adopt the fee.  Binance also announced Thursday that it will add LUNC trading against Tether's USDT to its trading pair list, starting Friday.  However, the price rise may prove to be short-lived as the new fee parameter is unlikely to attract new investors to the blockchain, according to Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “It still remains a tough period for crypto in general and investors still have a bad Terra taste in their mouth from the collapse earlier in the year,” he told CoinDesk.  Howard Greenberg, cryptocurrency educator at Prosper Trading Academy, said that “this is a total speculation play and basically turns LUNC into a meme coin at this point.”  “It will be a very volatile trade, and if someone chooses to enter the trade I would make sure you have an exit plan for both downside and upside.”  The Terra blockchain’s multibillion-dollar implosion in May was the epicenter of the current crypto crisis and led to the insolvency of multiple crypto lenders and investment firms. The network’s algorithmic stablecoin, terraUSD (formerly UST), lost its peg to the dollar, and sent LUNC (formerly LUNA), which was supposed to stabilize the stablecoin, into hyperinflation. The current supply of LUNC is nearly 7 trillion tokens, and even taking into account the new burn it won’t significantly change the coin’s fundamentals.  Most developers and investors have left the network. Those who decided to stay created a duplicate of the Terra blockchain as part of an attempt to have a fresh start for the ecosystem. The old blockchain still remained functional and was rebranded to Terra Classic, hosting the stablecoin USTC and its sister token LUNC.

""It is very much our view, and my view, that we need to act now, forthrightly, strongly, as we have been doing,"" Powell said during a question and answer session at the Washington, D.C.-based Cato Institute.  His remarks were made Thursday, the same day the European Central Bank (ECB) hiked its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points – the largest such move in its history.  Amid all the news, bitcoin (BTC) remains near multi-year lows, currently trading at $19,200.  In the U.S. “the clock is ticking” on inflation, forcing the Fed to act quickly, Powell said. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed's rate-setting body, next meets Sept. 20-21 and – following a string of hawkish remarks over the past couple of weeks – is widely expected to lift its benchmark Fed funds rate by another 75 basis points.  “The longer inflation remains well above target, the greater the risk the public does begin to see higher inflation as the norm,” Powell said.  As with his speech at the Fed’s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, last week, Powell took note of the “several failed attempts” by the 1970s Fed to cool inflation. Then-Chairman Paul Volcker finally took action to push for a rise in interest rates to extreme levels, thus pushing the U.S. into a difficult recession. Powell said it’s his hope today’s Fed can calm inflation without causing that kind of social cost.  Similar to remarks on Wednesday by Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard, Powell stressed that restoring price stability will take time and cause some pain to the labor market and to households. It’s important, he said, not to claim victory over prices too soon.  “History cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy,” said Powell. “I can assure you that my colleagues and I are strongly committed to this project and we will keep at it until the job is done.”  While most of the questions asked by Cato President Peter Goettler focused on monetary policymaking, Goettler also challenged the Fed chair on cryptocurrency issues, specifically stablecoins.  Read more: Crypto Doesn't Need More Guidance, SEC Chair Gensler Says  Powell appeared to take a dim view of unbacked crypto assets, noting they’re not a great store of value and the public has little interest in using them for payments. As for stablecoins, Powell stressed the need for proper regulation if these are to have the properties of money such as clarity, transparency and full reserves.  “I don't think you want to take money and make it into just another consumer product where sometimes it fails and sometimes it's good,” he said.  Powell’s comments on crypto were closely in line with remarks made Wednesday by Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr in which he stressed the importance of greater regulatory oversight for crypto activities.

42411376,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNQPu,1662653927,Why Traditional Investors May Not Love DAOs,"While venture capital’s interest in crypto continues despite the bear market, it might well be undergoing a critical test. Episodes such as the sanctioning of Tornado Cash throw light on the friction between the law of the land and the law of decentralization. While this has caused great debate in the crypto community, it has steadily created deeper concerns among venture investors, albeit quietly. A watershed event occurred (and passed without much fanfare) amidst the contagion, which exemplified these cracks.  Tanvi Ratna is the CEO of Policy 4.0, a research and advisory body working on policy approaches for digital assets.  On June 9 of this year, the community of Merit Circle DAO voted out Yield Guild Games (YGG) as their seed investor. By doing so, the community canceled the SAFT agreement binding Merit Circle Ltd., its parent entity, and its investor, YGG. This vote was the first incident where decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance overturned a legal agreement, and in its aftermath sent shockwaves across the investor ranks.  YGG gets booted out of Merit Circle  The simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT) is the de facto legal agreement used in financial deals for early stage crypto projects. Interestingly, this practice has its roots in the initial coin offering boom of 2017 as a way to avoid security regulations. When a project raises funds through a SAFT, it is accepting money from that investor without selling, offering or exchanging a coin or token. However, SAFTs are non-debt financial instruments and investors who purchase a SAFT may lose their money and have no recourse if the venture fails.  YGG entered into a SAFT agreement with Merit Circle Limited in September 2021 for a 175,000 USDC seed investment into Merit Circle DAO. Ahead of the vesting schedule, in April 2022, Merit Circle posted a new initiative on their forum asking seed investors to highlight their contributions to the Merit Circle DAO.  Several investors expressed deep concern over the incident.  Many members of the community believed that YGG did not add value to the DAO. A member of the DAO created a proposal for canceling YGG’s SAFT by refunding their initial investment and buying back the tokens. This proposal received a majority vote and support from the DAO community.  This was an extremely worrying development for the founding team, which had to move into damage control mode. They highlighted the contributions of YGG to the community, even warned the community about the moral and legal ramifications of canceling the agreement. More importantly, they requested the owner of the proposal to put forward an alternate proposal to find middle ground with YGG. A counterproposal was finally passed wherein the DAO bought out YGG’s 5 million MC tokens at 32 cents each for a total of $1,750,000. While this gave YGG a substantial 10x return on its investment, it was left with no governance rights or any future involvement in the growth of the project.  The law of the land vs. the law of the DAO  Publicly, both YGG and Merit Circle DAO issued statements signaling an amicable settlement. But, speaking to CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity, several investors expressed deep concern over the incident.  The inability to publicly express concern over such an incident is already an odd compulsion for investors in the space. From a legal perspective, YGG did have grounds to enforce the terms of the SAFT and win back its governance rights and capital gains as accrued over the five-year period in the agreement. But most VCs admitted that they would not have taken such action either and would have reached a settlement like YGG did. Reputation is the most sacrosanct currency for investors in the space and any indication of them being unfriendly towards community decisions could severely impact their deal flow. As one investor put it, “In this space everything is dictated by narratives, whether or not the facts support it. We cannot risk a narrative building against our fund.”  Even if legal recourse existed, the incident showed how starkly underdeveloped legal protections are for investors in the space. Despite a SAFT being in place, it provided no protection when pitted against a community vote. Legal action was also overruled by investors due to the absence of legal precedent for situations like this, which could result in long drawn and fruitless legal battles for them.  Read more: The Novel Legal Strategy Bringing This ICO-Backed ‘Micro-Mobility’ Startup to Court  As VC attitudes towards DAO investments get more cautious, this will “definitely shift the structuring of SAFTs going forward,” says Romit Mehta of Lightspeed Capital India. SAFT agreements may become more watertight with respect to the vesting schedule, obligations of the investor and the internal power structure of the DAO. The metrics for the value add of an investor may also be properly defined in future SAFT agreements. Investors might also confer additional requirements in terms of business structure such as for registering the DAO as a Wyoming DAO LLC, a brand new legal designation.  Can communities judge fairly?  On the one hand, this case shows the power of communities in holding freeloading investors accountable. On the other hand, given the often-intangible benefits of investors, it also raises real questions about whether communities can accurately gauge the value addition provided by investors. The perception of value provided by the investor can be different for founders, the core team and the community. The credibility brought by an investor to the project through early-stage funding is difficult to attribute quantitatively.  Additionally, in the early stages, investors and founders often have private discussions that might be very valuable for the project. Above all, there can be information asymmetry between the founders and the community once the project is sufficiently decentralized. Even in the case of Merit Circle, we saw that the founding team were in support of YGG and had a different opinion about their value add as compared to the community.  Nitin Sharma, General Partner and Global Web 3 lead of VC firm Antler Global, believes that value-add to crypto projects can either come from global institutional investors or investors with specialized knowledge in crypto. While crypto specialists bring in domain expertise for product development, global investors bring in new relationships, advisors, and employees from all over the world. Their experience in investing serves as a network effect and can be valuable for the early growth of the project. However, this is a value that is difficult for a community to evaluate.  Read more: Gaming DAO Merit Circle, YGG ‘Terminate Relationship’  In the case of YGG and Merit Circle DAO, YGG clarified in its official statement that the SAFT did not confer any obligation to provide any “value-add” services to the DAO. This raises the question of the criteria using which the community could dishonor a legal agreement and expel an investor.  Going forward, we will see more deliberations on whether the DAO community should have its say on all the matters of the DAO. The open system of governance might empower any community member to have their influence on all important matters concerning the DAO. But they could disregard legal commitments to investors.  At the same time, communities are the cornerstone for the success of a DAO. Founders have to strike a difficult balance between decentralization and having their voice and may decide to not pass on all the governance decisions to the community. Investors are themselves likely to engage in secondary due diligence and will look more deeply into the voting structure and expectations of the community.  This incident has set a landmark precedent in the investment boom into DAOs. Given the overall increase in regulation of crypto, and the bear market, we will see shifts in the way VCs legally structure their investments in future DAOs",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | ZRX | TOKEN SALE,Tanvi Ratna,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/08/why-traditional-investors-may-not-love-daos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1ac9f7154fe08f770d0d445eda724bd9859b6f3-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  Brazil topped 1 million registered crypto users in July for the first time, the South American country's tax authority, Receita Federal, reported this week.  Receita Federal said 1.33 million Brazilians made crypto purchases in July, 68% more than in June.  The report included crypto purchases made on Brazilian exchanges only, because foreign platforms are not obligated to comply with local regulation 1888, which, in 2019, required crypto companies to report Brazilian users’ transactions to the authority.  One of the points of a crypto bill currently being considered by the Brazilian Congress is the requirement for foreign exchanges to have an Employer Identification Number (EIN) in order to apply for a local license, which would force them to report transactions as well.  The Brazilian tax authority also included reports made by individual investors or companies, both of which are obliged to disclose monthly amounts above 30,000 Brazilian reais ($5,740).  According to a survey released by the Brazilian Association of Financial and Capital Market Entities (Anbima), the total number of crypto investors in the country exceeded 4.2 million people in June, representing 2% of the population.  July's growth coincides with the entry into crypto of Nubank, the country’s largest digital bank by market value, which in July said it reached 1 million crypto users after starting its crypto platform in May.  In July, Brazilians transacted 13.7 billion reais of crypto, 11% less than in June and 28% less than in May, Receita Federal added.

42373865,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVqfn,1662651664,DeFi Lending Protocol Notional to Offer New Leveraged Product,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Notional Finance will soon offer ""leveraged vaults,"" a new kind of DeFi lending product, to its users, according to a Wednesday blog post on the company’s website.  Notional will offer three leveraged vaults, which are slated to go live in October. The leveraged vaults will allow Notional’s protocol to generate more revenue from transaction fees and reduce its dependence on liquidity incentives, with users gaining access to higher interest rates as borrowing demand increases, Notional co-founder Teddy Woodward told CoinDesk.  “Leveraged vaults are a big step forward to increasing capital efficiency for DeFi users and for the DeFi space as a whole,” Woodward said.  Leveraged vaults are a form of crypto lending and borrowing via on-chain liquidity pools that allow users to borrow cryptocurrencies at a fixed rate. That crypto is then deposited into a whitelisted smart contract designed to execute a specific yield strategy.  The amount of currency the user puts up determines the amount of currency that the user can borrow from the protocol, with Notional’s three leveraged vault options allowing users to trade up to 10 or 20 times their initial capital. The minimum amount of capital a user can put up hasn't been set yet, but it will “vary depending on the vault,” Woodward said.  By using lending vaults, a user who puts up 100,000 USDC could net 36% annual percentage yield (APY) on his initial investment over a three-month term, according to the blog.  But with greater potential for reward also comes greater potential risks.  “The more leverage the user takes on, the greater their potential upside and downside,” the blog read.  Notional’s leveraged vault launch comes as the lender continues to increase its DeFi presence. Last fall, the lending protocol launched its V2 upgrade following a $10 million Series A funding round led by Pantera Capital. Notional launched in beta on the Ethereum blockchain in October 2020 after 10 months in stealth mode.

42373876,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVqsN,1662650971,House Republicans Want Answers From Fed on Digital Dollar,"U.S. Republican lawmakers are demanding answers from a top Federal Reserve official on how the central bank views its powers to issue a digital dollar.  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the senior Republican on the House Financial Services Committee – and potentially its next chairman, sent a letter alongside other committee Republicans asking Fed Vice Chairwoman Lael Brainard to explain her view on the central bank’s authority. Specifically, they want to know exactly what can trigger a Fed decision on creating a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC).  The letter focuses on several points from Brainard’s testimony before the panel in May, which was her first after being sworn in as vice chairwoman of the Fed board. At that hearing, she said the Fed wouldn’t act on issuing a CBDC without “strong support” from the White House and Congress, adding that the agency had no intention of serving consumers directly.  The letter, dated Wednesday, called for Brainard to clarify what she meant by support that would justify the Fed’s move – whether that could be in the form of non-binding communications, like letters or executive orders.  “Is it your view the Federal Reserve may not establish an intermediated CBDC model without direct authorization from Congress?” the letter asked. It also requested more information about the Fed’s position on whether it could directly manage digital accounts for individuals, a key point for Republicans who insist that the financial industry maintain a central role.  Fed officials, Chairman Jerome Powell among them, have repeatedly raised this topic, including in remarks this week. On Wednesday, Powell said that the Fed’s leaders “haven't made any decisions at all about whether we should have a CBDC.”  Powell also addressed the Republican lawmakers’ chief concern: “We do not intend to proceed with issuance of a CBDC without clear support from both the executive branch and Congress, ideally in the form of a specific authorization,” he said.  That position, which has become a chief talking point for Fed officials, had also been echoed the day before by Michael Barr, the board’s new vice chairman for supervision. Barr also said he didn’t feel a Fed decision on a digital dollar is urgent, and he said that if one is eventually issued, he leans toward a model that would see financial firms handling people’s digital-dollar accounts.  Republicans remain in a strong position to take control of the U.S. House of Representatives after November’s midterm elections. If that happens, their party would decide the committee’s agenda and its legislative priorities.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/08/republicans-want-answers-from-fed-on-what-itll-take-to-justify-digital-dollar,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ecc4fceff8fea8450a2b38cc16b4e3297e07dc6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Market Moves: Ethereum's upcoming Merge will likely be a near-term catalyst for greater adoption of staking on Coinbase’s platform, Goldman Sachs said in a report.  Chart of the Day: Bitcoin supply per whale (large investor) has dropped to its lowest level since December 2020.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) was back trading above $19,000 Thursday, appearing to stabilize at a lower level after its 10-day stretch at around the $20,000 mark came to an end earlier this week. Bitcoin, which is the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, was up 2.4% over the last 24 hours, while ether (ETH), the second largest, was up 6%.  In traditional markets, stock futures were wavering after major U.S. stock indexes finished the day higher on Wednesday. The European Central Bank raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage point, its biggest single hike since it began setting monetary policy in 1999.  Winners among the altcoin market were NEAR, the token of the Near Protocol, which recently rose 10%, and FLOW, which traded up 9%. Last week, Ticketmaster announced a partnership with Dapper Labs – the company behind the Flow blockchain. The partnership will enable event organizers to issue non-fungible tokens (NFTs) before, during and after live events.  HNT, the token of the Helium decentralized open wireless network, surged 20% on the day after the network submitted a proposal to migrate to the Solana blockchain from its standalone blockchain last week.  In the news, crypto exchange Binance announced it is seeking to accelerate transaction times and reduce fees for its BNB blockchain, becoming one of the largest players yet to embrace a technology known as a zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup.  Aave Cos., a development lab overseeing crypto lending protocol Aave, is seeking over $16 million from the Aave community to pay for development work on the platform.  Also, a group of Celsius Network borrowers wants a bankruptcy court to appoint an independent examiner to investigate the crypto lender’s financials, but not one working for the U.S. Trustee office.

Coinbase has continued to expand its staking offering and recently announced support for institutional clients, adding staking for cardano (ADA) and solana (SOL), and will eventually support ether (ETH) after the Merge, Goldman analysts led by Will Nance wrote.  The Merge, or the switch from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, is the first of five planned upgrades for the Ethereum blockchain and is expected to happen next week.  Goldman sees Coinbase generating $250 million to $600 million in additional staking revenue from ether staking, assuming that around 20% to 40% of the ETH on its platform is staked.

Chart of The Day  Bitcoin Supply Per Whale Drops to Lowest Since December 2020  By Omkar Godbole  Supply per whale, calculated as dividing the total supply owned by addresses holding 100 BTC to 10,000 BTC by the address count, has declined to 554.65 BTC, its lowest level since December 2020.  The continued decline suggests a low probability of a bull revival in the near term.  The metric increases when whales are boosting their aggregate holdings and decreases during distribution events.

42373869,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVqjZ,1662646276,White House Calls for Crypto Mining Standards to Minimize Environmental Impact,"The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy called for the U.S. to conduct further research on the energy impact of crypto mining in order to set standards for the industry, in a new report published Thursday.  In the report, among the first publicly available responses to U.S. President Joe Biden's executive order on cryptocurrencies, the office detailed its approach to the question of what sort of impact crypto mining has on the environment, including what is the scale of the impact and how different cryptocurrencies differ in their energy needs.  The report calls on federal agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy to work with states and local officials to develop standards for the industry’s impact on the environment; the intensity and source of energy that goes into it, noise pollution, water usage as well as how to build carbon-free energy to balance out crypto mining’s consumption.  ""Should these measures prove ineffective at reducing impacts, the Administration should explore executive actions, and Congress might consider legislation, to limit or eliminate the use of high energy intensity consensus mechanisms for crypto-asset mining,"" the report said.  Read more: Inside the Environmentalist Campaign to Change Bitcoin’s Code  The report said that crypto mining, particularly bitcoin (BTC) mining, uses a lot of electricity, which undermines U.S. sustainability goals.  ""Global electricity generation for the crypto assets with the largest market capitalizations resulted in a combined 140 ± 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year (Mt CO2/y), or about 0.3% of global annual GHG emissions,"" the report said.  Protecting the grid  The Biden administration also wants energy regulators and grid operators to ensure that crypto mining doesn’t jeopardize the stability of electricity grids and drive up prices for consumers. Bitcoin miners, on the other hand, argue they can contribute to the reliability of electricity grids because they can act as a base load consumer that can power off at times of peak demand, as happened this summer during heatwaves throughout the U.S. and particularly in Texas.  To this argument, the White House said: “While reducing this peak during a grid emergency is valuable, the increased peak is often why demand response is necessary, establishing misaligned incentives between crypto-asset miners and grid operators. Full transparency of demand response participation and payments by crypto-asset miners and other demand response participants are essential.”  At the same time, the White House is asking for better data on the use of clean energy by the industry, pointing out that miners that don’t use carbon-emitting energy do not contribute to emissions. “Uncertainty” around how much clean energy the industry uses has to be dispelled with better data, the report said.  Read more: Can Crypto Miners Make the World Greener?  On the bright side  Interestingly, the White House report did cautiously express support for crypto miners that use flared and vented methane to operate their machines. This method has gained popularity in the past couple of years, with mining firms deploying data centers at natural gas extraction sites.  “While the EPA and the Department of the Interior have proposed new rules to reduce methane for oil and natural gas operations, crypto-asset mining operations that capture vented methane to produce electricity can yield positive results for the climate, by converting the potent methane to [carbon dioxide] during combustion,” the report said. “Mining operations, though, could potentially be more reliable and more efficient at converting methane to CO2.”  Using vapor capture technologies may be more effective at reducing methane emissions, however, the report added.  The report concluded that while net-zero emissions would have zero methane venting or flaring, “Crypto-asset mining that installs equipment to use vented methane to generate electricity for operations is more likely to help rather than hinder U.S. climate objectives.”  The White House did lay out which miners lead to zero direct emissions; those who buy or build new renewable energy capacity, and those that consume renewable energy that would otherwise be wasted, of which there is plenty in the U.S.  “To help U.S. climate objectives, industries could volunteer or be required to build zero-carbon energy capacity that produces more electricity than the crypto-asset miner requires, selling excess clean energy back to the grid,” the report said.  Though the environmental report represents one of the more controversial issues, two previous reports had emerged from the executive order. One, from the Treasury Department, was a fact sheet issued in July outlining how the U.S. could work with foreign regulators to address the cryptocurrency sector. The other came from the Justice Department and suggested the U.S. should share more information about crimes tied to cryptocurrency and help build up its overseas partnerships to help combat them.

42373874,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVqr7,1662645992,Crypto Startup Slide Raises $12.3M to Connect New Users to Web3 Apps,"Slide, a startup that provides user experience infrastructure for decentralized applications (dapps), has raised $12.3 million in a seed funding round that was co-led by crypto-focused investment firms Polychain Capital and Framework Ventures. The funding will help Slide continue to hire more staff, build out its infrastructure and distribute its product to dapps.  A new user who wants to interact with a Web3 application often has to find third-party sources for buying crypto and holding the assets in order to spend the crypto in the app. Slide offers an all-in-one tool that keeps users within the app with features that include non-fungible token (NFT) purchases via credit card and a non-custodial wallet that’s set up with an email address rather than a browser extension.  “We’re enabling any user, regardless of their background or experience, to be able to use Web3,” Slide CEO and co-founder Teymour Farman-Farmaian told CoinDesk in an interview. “It’s really hard right now for the average user to use dapps, and it’s hard for the incremental dapp to gain any kind of exposure to normal users. Both sides are having trouble reaching each other.”  Read more: What Is a Dapp? Decentralized Apps Explained  New York-based Slide was founded earlier this year by Farman-Farmaian, a former product lead at crypto exchange Coinbase, and Sam Hatem, who previously worked as a blockchain developer at event-betting platform Polymarket.

The company expects to have a full, open launch by the end of the year, Farman-Farmaian said.  The venture capital arm of Coinbase, USDC issuer Circle and investment firm Outlander Ventures also participated in the funding round. Individual investors included former Coinbase Chief Technology Officer Balaji Srinivasan, Dragonfly Capital partner Ani Pai and Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan.  Lead investor Framework Ventures started a $400 million fund in April to back Web3 gaming and decentralized finance.  “Under the right circumstances, we think billions of people could come on-chain over the next decade, and we think UX (user experience) infrastructure projects like Slide will play a key role in that migration,” Framework Ventures investor Rajiv Patel-O'Connor told CoinDesk in an emailed statement.",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | USDC,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/08/slide-raises-123m-to-connect-new-crypto-users-to-web3-apps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ab21da7f1e911105ccbde8eeee354e7b9246862-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373883,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVr2R,1662645606,Chicago Bulls to Release NFT Artwork Reimagining Its Iconic Logo,"The Chicago Bulls are releasing a new NFT collection later this month featuring ""1-of-1"" artworks designed by several well-known artists tasked with reimagining the National Basketball Association team's iconic logo.  The logo – a red charging bull's face with black and white accents – is unique in that it hasn't changed significantly since the team was founded in 1966. The logo was created by commercial designer Dean Wessel, who was offered free tickets to a game in exchange for the now-synonymous image. The non-fungible token works won't replace the logo but are the first official invitation from the organization to envision a different branding.  The team has worked with 23 artists across the NFT landscape to reinterpret the logo across artistic mediums. Chicago-based artists like Michael Salisbury and NoPattern pay homage to their city alongside global designers like Bobby Hundreds, Blake Jamieson, Gxng Yxng of Ghxsts, Maliha Abidi, Betty and Psych from the NFT project Deadfellaz, Varvara Alay and more.  ""As a '90s kid, I grew up watching Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman play,"" said Claire Salvo, who reinterpreted the logo using a ballpoint pen on paper. ""It was an era when pro athletes were also becoming pop culture icons. The team, the players and the era are all so nostalgic for me.""  Each piece of art will be minted as a single 1-of-1 NFT on the Ethereum blockchain exclusively through Coinbase's NFT platform. The collection, titled ""The Aurochs,"" will be auctioned off on Sept. 22 with a starting price of 0.2 ETH, or roughly $320.  ""I am a fan of simple yet impactful bold imagery,"" said artist Zoe Rain on what drew her to the project. ""The power and stature of the Bull is something appreciated and revered by all cultures.""  Proceeds from the collection will be split, with 40% going to artists and 40% going to the Bulls. The NBA will pocket 10% and the final 10% will go to After School Matters, a Chicago-based nonprofit aimed at providing educational opportunities to Chicago's youth.  The Bulls previously released a Legacy NFT Collection in July 2021, consisting of several images representing the team's six World Championship rings. The collection offered exclusive benefits for owners of multiple NFTs, including a ""Bull for a Day"" VIP meet-and-greet experience and courtside seats.

42373880,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVqxP,1662644879,International Regulators Struggle With How to Oversee DeFi,"International financial regulators are trying sink their teeth into decentralized finance (DeFi), but they are split on whether they can do so simply by extending current norms.  Standard setters see DeFi, which uses software to replicate traditional financial services like lending, as the next step in crypto markets. But in a series of articles published this week by financial lobby group Eurofi, regulators say they aren’t sure how they can curb the risks associated with DeFi like money laundering, cyberattacks and scams.  “DeFi needs to instill more trust,” Morten Bech, head of the Swiss Innovation Hub, wrote in one article. The Swiss Innovation Hub is run by the Bank for International Settlements, an association of the world’s central banks.  “Today crypto insiders are exploiting users’ lack of experience,” Bech wrote, citing scams such as front-running, where traders anticipate sales to manipulate prices.  His views were echoed by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (Iosco), a group of national regulators such as the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, which is looking to develop policies for DeFi.  “If DeFi can replicate financial products, it can also replicate other features of financial markets, in particular, their capacity to develop inter-connections that can threaten system-wide stability,” said Martin Moloney, Iosco’s secretary general, citing the recent failure of the Anchor Protocol built on the Terra blockchain.  “Our ambition is to lay out a basic, internationally applicable framework based on our principles and recommendations to govern crypto and digital asset activities that mimic financial products,” Moloney said.  So far, crypto regulation has often involved taking existing rules that apply to, say, banks, and applying them to the nearest Web3 equivalents, such as crypto trading platforms or wallet providers.  But that approach is already creating problems, like when people store their own crypto rather than using a regulated provider. And it’s slowly dawning on regulators that it won’t always work.  Fernando Restoy, chairman of the Financial Stability Institute, said that crypto has issues – like software bugs or over-pledged collateral – that don’t exist on the same scale in traditional finance.  Read more: Securities Regulators Cast Doubt on DeFi's Decentralization Claims  “It is not sensible to simply rely on the slogan ‘same activity, same regulation’,” said Restoy, whose organization operates as a kind of think tank attached to the BIS, citing a motto often used by lawmakers looking to extend existing norms to new sectors. “It would be a mistake to conclude that DeFi requires authorities only to adjust the regulatory perimeter of different financial activities.”  Traditional anti-money laundering obligations “could be ineffective in a decentralized setting,” Restoy said, especially with cross-border transactions. “A major task should be to identify the parties benefiting from the DeFi business and assess whether and how they could be made responsible for regulatory compliance.”  In recent months, policymakers such as German central banker Joachim Wuermeling have called for bank-style international regulators to address the growing DeFi “casino.” Others are dabbling with ideas on how to achieve that in practice, such as “embedded supervision,” in which computer code gives regulators a privileged perch to oversee financial activities.  For Bech, regulators should still try to get as far as they can using traditional methods.  “Oversight could then look like traditional infrastructure oversight: Those responsible are held to standards and censured if they fall short,” Bech said. “The focus is on the participants and the overall system.”  While it’s hard to enforce rules without a central operator, he suggests the public nature of blockchain data could help supervisors assess risks, and they could also require intermediaries to use only infrastructure that is deemed to be safe.  In any case, regulators witnessing the crypto market's turbulence are keen to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial market crisis that they worry could stem from an underregulated sector.  “The brave new species that developed on the crypto island will need to prove its competitiveness if released back into the mainland and will be at least as in need of regulation,” Moloney said. “What has been will be again.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/08/international-regulators-struggle-with-how-to-oversee-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5ae8ba3490f64cfb5910e4afec5a9fd70786a80-3776x2832.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411087,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC0Fk,1662643427,Why Crypto Isn't a Tool for Protest in Argentina,"I was in Buenos Aires on Argentina’s Independence Day, and so I went out for a piping hot bowl of ""freedom soup."" Called locro, this hearty stew of corn, beans and chorizo was invented centuries ago by the indigenous peoples of the Andes mountain ranges at the time of Incan empire.  These days, Argentines eat it on all their major patriotic holidays, celebrating the revival of their own culture after they kicked their Spanish colonizers to the curb in the 1810 revolution. The perfect comfort food on a (crypto) winter’s day, I sat inside a cozy local restaurant, savoring the taste of sovereignty while sipping a spectacular glass of Malbec.  But outside, national tensions were boiling over. Thousands of people had emerged from their homes and convened on the streets for a ""cacerolazo."" Derived from the Spanish word, cacerola, literally meaning stew pot, a cacerolazo is a nonviolent form of demonstration where protestors bang on pots and pans. I felt drawn to join them in the chilly July air, and together, we chanted in metronome to the clang of a thousand saucepan lids:  Ar-gen-tina, tee- tee- teena! Ar-gen-tina, tee- tee- teena!  Ar-gen-tina, tee- tee- teena! Ar-gen-tina, tee- tee- teena!  For decades, Argentines have been banging on about political dysfunction and instability, widespread corruption, constant boom-and-bust cycles and raging inflation. And historically, they have made enough noise to score rights, rewrite laws and cause governments to collapse. Like in 2001, when the government froze the bank accounts of 18 million Argentines, a cacerolazo ousted four presidents in three weeks. Or in 2012, another cacerolazo prevented then-President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner from changing the country’s constitution so that she could run for re-election.  Despite those stopgap victories, Argentina is still a dog’s breakfast politically and economically. Inflation is out of control. The country narrowly avoided default on a ginormous International Monetary Fund debt, which would have been the 10th time in history it had failed to pay its debts. The economic minister has since thrown in the towel. And Fernandez, who has been vice president since 2019, just survived an assassination attempt.  Amid all this, I’ve seen many articles romanticizing crypto’s role in alleviating Argentina’s agony. They say it is a tool for freedom. They say it's bringing economic independence. They imply that these stablecoin-HODLing Argentines are economic dissidents using crypto as a weapon to fight for a new financial paradigm. Which is probably to be expected. After all, encoded in Bitcoin’s genesis block was a poignant reference to the banks being bailed out amid the 2008 global financial crisis, and as such, the crypto community has always loved to tout its technology as a tool of dissent. But Argentina’s craving for stablecoins is no indicator of revolution.  Hyper-inflation  To put this into perspective: Yes, inflation is bad everywhere right now. But in Argentina, it’s running over 70% and will likely go triple digits by year’s end – which sounds insane, but isn’t unheard of. Between 1975 and 1990, Argentina averaged 300% inflation as the government printed pesos and sprinkled them over the economy amid a debt crisis. While I was there, I heard that Argentines had become so used to their money losing value, that as long as wages were increasing in tandem with prices, many would quit pot-banging and go back to eating celebratory soup.  “Pretty much the whole Argentine people knows that the currency is bad; we’ve kind of been raised with dollars in our mind because it's a much harder currency than ours,” said Mariano Di Pietrantonio, who heads strategy at Maker Growth, a core unit of MakerDAO, the lending platform that powers the DAI decentralized stablecoin. DAI is much loved by Argentines, and Di Pietrantonio pointed to the country’s currency controls, or El Cepo, as the reason why.  Argentina’s craving for stablecoins is no indicator of revolution  Amid persistent market uncertainty, Argentina’s appetite for the stability of USD had become so large that it began to drain the central bank’s own reserves. In response, the government set a price for dollars – a price that made the peso appear to be stronger than it was – and put a lid on how much the people could buy. In 2011, it was $10,000 a month. Today, it’s $200 a month, and the “white dollar,” as it’s known, also slaps buyers with a 65% tax. It’s an attempt to stabilize the economy, but all it has done is create a big black market.  Go for a stroll in downtown Buenos Aires and you get these creepy dudes approaching you from the shadows. For a fee, they chaperone tourists (and locals) into little stalls where the “blue dollar” can be bought and sold outside of the formal channels at a price that isn’t enforced by the banks, meaning it’s closer to what the market is actually willing to pay for pesos. It’s one of many options on a color-coded price list for people buying USD in Argentina.  Trading USD outside of the formal channels is illegal, but everybody does it. And if Argentines can’t change their pesos into USD, they buy something else. They stock up on groceries, or pay bills, or buy furniture, or grab a Mother’s Day gift for next year. They will buy anything that lets them lock in the price of goods today in fear that it will be unaffordable by next week.  Stablecoin premium  You needn’t be a crypto maxi to see how crypto is an attractive alternative in an economic landscape as nightmarish as this. First, there’s no limit on how much you can buy. But also, crypto never sleeps, and so it can be acquired any time, unlike dollars that are accessible only during business hours. It’s no surprise then, that, after their economic minister called it quits on a Saturday, Argentines bought three times the volume of stablecoins they normally would on a weekend. Rather than sit on their hands, they paid a premium to buy stables. Staring down yet another political crisis, they knew that no amount of pot-banging will prevent their savings from going poof after market uncertainty kicks into overdrive.  That was the weekend before I landed in Buenos Aires in early July, and since then, Argentines have withdrawn over $1 billion in dollar deposits from the banking system. Where those dollars end up is hard to follow. Most of it is probably stashed under mattresses, but at least some of it got converted to crypto through centralized exchanges like Ripio, which reported the pump in stablecoins. Argentina requires crypto traders to link and verify their bank account. So for those without one, or who wish to trade outside of the formal system, they go to peer-to-peer (P2P) via grassroots groups that have flourished on WhatsApp and Facebook. It’s impossible to measure but I suspect the P2P sector dwarfs the regulated market.  You can see this as a sort of passive protest. And if cryptos like DAI are adopted widely enough via decentralized communities that exist outside of the formal systems, this makes it tougher for the government to introduce anti-crypto regulation without incurring a political cost. But this rhetoric assumes that the holders of stablecoins do so with intent to change or dismantle something, when really, they are probably just sick and tired of protesting. Stablecoins are the closest they can get to what they truly want, that is, USD. Or better, a peso that doesn’t keep them awake at night.  Every day that crypto is not regulated in a third-world country, it will be difficult for the regulators to do it without a political cost  When Di Pietrantonio led the introduction of DAI to Argentina in 2018, before USDC existed and Tether was still running on the Omni protocol, he saw that crypto exchanges like Binance and Bitfinex were occupied by speculators buying volatile assets like bitcoin. Instead, he wanted to reach the “sheltering people” who didn’t desire crypto because it might increase in value, but because it might not become worthless. His strategy proved successful: Argentina is now in the world’s top 10 for crypto adoption.  Even so, he says there’s no local DAI community in the sense that Gary Vee would evangelize it. “They’re not DAI-hards,” he told me, admitting that stablecoins are just a commodity for Argentines. As long as it will hold its value, they’ll go with DAI, USDC, USDT, whatever is the most liquid. “There's not much differentiation, to be honest,” he said.  Additionally, in a country starving for stability, where nearly 40% live below the poverty line, the holders of DAI probably didn’t mint it, since people who mint an over-collateralized algorithmic stablecoin tend to have … a lot of collateral. According to Di Pietrantonio, the average mint via the MakerDAO protocol is around 100,000 DAI. Of course, it’s a trustless protocol, and so there’s no way to know who those people are, but they likely don't fit the profile of an Argentine ""HODLer."" Mariano said the average local transaction is more like $200 to $700.  From this, I also assumed that Argentines were active consumers of DAI, but not investors in MakerDAO who were concerned with running the protocol and thus holding the MKR token in order to participate in governance.  “No,” said Di Pietrantonio when I asked for his thoughts on it. “Governance and DAOs are another monster.”  No protest  In any case, crypto has certainly caught the government’s attention. Case in point: The Buenos Aires government announced this year that it would allow residents to pay their taxes in crypto. The move was applauded by blockchain evangelists across the world, but when I asked locals about it, they rolled their eyes and said no Argentine was dumb enough to fall for a Trojan Horse. Aside from the idiocy of linking their wallet address with their government-issued identity, the initiative totally missed the appeal of holding stablecoins amid an inflationary environment.  “We use the hard currency for savings, not for payments,” Di Pietrantonio said, pointing to Gresham's Law. Following the theory that people will use bad money over good money to pay for stuff, he posited: If you had a DAI, a dollar and a peso, which would you use to purchase a hamburger?  Read: Argentines Take Refuge in Stablecoins After Economy Minister Resignation  If you answered pesos, you would be correct, because no one wants Argentine pesos.  As for the political signaling, Fernandez, the vice president, has said she’s open to Argentina adopting bitcoin. But Di Pietrantonio warned that this shouldn't be confused as a sign that the government wants to empower its people.  “They don't care if it is good for the people, they only care what is good for them,” he said, rattling off some of party lines that politicians love to cite, like, ""We won’t clamp down on crypto,"" or ""We won’t stifle innovation, blah blah.""  ""It is just a pitch for the popular vote, especially among upper-middle-class voters who hold crypto purely because they have some level of wealth to protect. Every day that crypto is not regulated in a third-world country, it will be difficult for the regulators to do it without a political cost,” Di Pietrantonio said.  The crypto community loves to hype adoption stories like Argentina’s, but sometimes a slice of humble pie is in order. There’s a difference between an active, politically charged protest that demands real change versus the coping measures we adopt out of necessity in order to survive amid the kind of adversity that is largely outside of our control. Crypto is a safe haven, a bomb shelter, peace of mind and a store of value for people trapped in a place where “value” is fleeting. And it does an excellent job at that.  But it doesn’t prevent the prices from going up, or quell political tensions, or stop corruption, or settle a country’s IMF debt any sooner. When I was there, lost inside the cacerolazo alongside all the old ladies and their pots and their pans, I felt a sense of patriotism. Argentines hold a lot of DAI, but they hold even more hope for a better Argentina.

42373870,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVqkp,1662643034,"Crypto Engineers, Investors Sue US Treasury Over Tornado Cash Sanctions","Six crypto users are suing the U.S. Treasury Department for blacklisting Tornado Cash last month, claiming the department’s sanctions watchdog overstepped its authority in prohibiting all American persons from interacting with the privacy tool.  According to the suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) didn't have the legal right to designate Tornado Cash, which the suit refers to as “a decentralized, open-source software project that restores some privacy for Ethereum users,” as a sanctioned entity because it isn't an entity, person or organization.  OFAC added Tornado Cash’s wallet addresses, including smart wallet addresses, to its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list last month, saying the privacy mixer was a key tool for North Korean hackers, who used it to launder crypto stolen from projects like Axie Infinity. The SDN list is made up of blacklisted individuals or companies that are owned by, or are acting on behalf of, countries targeted by OFAC.  The plaintiffs are Coinbase employees Tyler Almeida and Nate Welch, Prysmatic Labs co-founder Preston Van Loon, GridPlus engineer Kevin Vitale, Ethereum proponent and angel investor Alex Fisher and former Amazon engineer Joseph Van Loon. Crypto exchange Coinbase is funding the effort.  Each of the plaintiffs has some ether (ETH) locked in Tornado Cash that he or she used for various legal purposes – including donating to Ukraine and protecting their private wallets from being traceable to their public online identities – but can no longer access because of the OFAC’s sanctions, the suit claims.  Alongside Treasury, the plaintiffs are suing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and OFAC Director Andrea Gacki.  The plaintiffs are claiming OFAC violated the Administrative Procedures Act, which dictates how federal agencies must develop and issue regulations, because Tornado Cash isn't property or a foreign national or country, and therefore the sanctions watchdog exceeded its authority.  The filing also claims a violation of the plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights to “engage in important, socially valuable speech.”  Preston Van Loon, Almeida and Welch are also claiming a violation of their Fifth Amendment rights, which protect against self-incrimination, as they didn't receive a notice or any other form of prior process before their ETH was frozen.  As a result, the plaintiffs are calling on the court to “declare that defendants’ designation is null, void, and with no force and effect; declare that defendants’ designation is not in accordance with law; … vacate the designation; permanently enjoin defendants’ and their officers, employees and agents from enforcing, implementing, applying or taking any action whatsoever under, or in reliance on, the designation,” and litigation costs.  Read more: Issues Crypto Should Watch For in the Tornado Cash Sanctions  Controversial designation  OFAC’s designation of Tornado Cash and its smart wallet addresses has been controversial since it was announced last month.  Crypto think tank Coin Center said in a blog post that this was the first time software, rather than an individual or entity, was added to the SDN list, a point the plaintiffs jumped on.  “Historically, defendants have used their delegated authority to designate individuals, corporations and other entities on the SDN list. For instance, on February 25, 2022, OFAC added Vladimir Putin to the SDN list,” the filing said, referring to the Russian president. “Defendants have also designated Blender.io, a virtual currency mixer … Unlike Tornado Cash, Blender.io is operated under centralized control. Also unlike Tornado Cash, users of Blender.io do not retain custody of particular crypto asset at all times and instead receive randomly ‘mixed’ crypto assets.”  Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, told CoinDesk that while the exchange has “the utmost respect for Treasury and OFAC … the recent designations of the Tornado Cash smart contracts gave us serious pause.”  The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

42373886,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVqzv,1662642214,"Ethereum Merge May Not Be Immediately Deflationary, Crypto Trading Firm QCP Says","Ethereum's long-awaited technological overhaul, the Merge, is just a week away and holders of the blockchain's native token ether (ETH) may be feeling giddy because the upgrade is widely projected to establish ETH as a deflationary cryptocurrency – one with a depreciating supply – and bring more buyers to the market.  The supposedly bullish pivot, however, may remain elusive for some time, according to Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital.  ""The uber-bullish thesis is that ETH 2.0 will immediately herald a new era of deflationary supply for ETH,"" strategists at QCP wrote in a recently published report. ""This is not entirely true. For now, at least.""  The QCP strategists, led by co-founder and Chief Investment Officer Darius Sit, said low network usage could delay ether's transformation into a deflationary cryptocurrency.  ""Where the bullish kicker will come is in the burn rate – which in the midst of [crypto] winter is not looking so bullish right now,"" QCP strategists noted.  The burn rate – the number of ether tokens taken out of circulation daily due to the protocol burning of a portion of transaction fees paid in the cryptocurrency – is essentially tied to the network usage, which has cooled this year because of the bear market.  Explaining the Merge and the burn rate  The Merge will combine ether's current proof-of-work (PoW) chain with the proof-of-stake (PoS) Beacon Chain that went live in December 2020.  That will mark the world's biggest smart contract blockchain's transition to a PoS consensus mechanism, which requires market participants to hold a minimum number of coins to validate transactions – contrasted with the current PoW setup, where miners solve computational problems to verify transactions in return for rewards paid in ETH.  The transition to PoS from PoW will take out a significant amount of miner supply.  According to QCP, miners now receive 5 million ETH annually ($8.1 billion). After the transition, that figure is expected to drop to 1 million ETH per year in rewards paid to stakers on PoS. (The amount of rewards paid depends on the number of stakers, which, in turn, is tied to staking yields.)  While that would significantly weaken supply-side pressures, ETH's net issuance would probably dive lower only if an uptick in the burn rate accompanies the decline in rewards paid to validators.  The average daily burn recently declined to a record low of 1,206 ETH per day. That's barely 9% of the record daily burn of 13,269 ETH registered in January. Meanwhile, 13.6 million ETH, amounting to 12% of the circulating supply of 120 million ETH, are locked in the Beacon Chain, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  Assuming the burn rate remains weak and the amount of ether staked doubles after the Merge, ether would still be an inflationary currency.  ""At the current burn rate and assuming 25% of the ETH 120 million ETH supply is staked – we will have an inflation supply of ~1%/year, compared to a deflationary supply of ~2% per year if we just revert to the all-time high burn,"" QCP strategists said.  Will the burn rate bounce?  Ethereum's burn rate is tied to network usage across various segments, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Surging activity in the NFT market was one of the major catalysts for the record burn rate reached in January. Early this year, NFT marketplace OpenSea, consistently represented more than 15% of all ETH destroyed daily.  So only a dramatic increase in the activity on DeFi platforms and NFT would lift the burn rate.  According to QCP, however, that's unlikely in the foreseeable future because DeFi yields are at ""rock bottom"" and NFT profile picture hype is ""flattening.""",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/08/ethereum-merge-may-not-be-immediately-deflationary-crypto-trading-firm-qcp-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f01318735bb76688e864ed023b40464d623a6ac-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411385,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNQwy,1662642000,"DeFi vs CeFi Lending: Before Choosing, Understand the Challenges and Risks","Crypto lending has become a very popular way for crypto investors to generate additional income on their crypto portfolios.  Before crypto lending was offered to investors, individuals typically had two methods to capitalize on their investments: one, long-term holding of coins and tokens; and two, short-term trading in and out of volatile markets.  As the crypto market matured, additional services were built and offered additional opportunities to investors. As decentralized finance (DeFi) grew, more traditional services like banking were brought to the crypto market.  Smart-contract enabled cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, allowed businesses to offer these banking services to crypto users globally. One of the most popular use cases of DeFi is to offer lending and borrowing services to crypto holders.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  Much like a bank that offers a yield to cash depositors, DeFi banking services offer yield to crypto holders. Users are able to deposit crypto tokens into a smart-contract and earn interest on their money, usually paid to them in the form of cryptocurrency.  These smart contract lending protocols typically offer a yield higher than traditional banks, which has attracted the attention of many crypto investors. DeFi banking services eliminate the need for a central party to facilitate the lending and borrowing functions, efficiently reducing fees and increasing yields to the participants.  DeFi lending uses the power of smart contracts to offer these services through blockchain technology.  DeFi benefits and drawbacks  Some of the benefits to using a DeFi lending protocol over a traditional bank include:  Anonymity  Decentralization  Over-collateralization of borrowing  Global accessibility  As the service grew in popularity, more businesses began offering DeFi-powered lending and borrowing services to the market. Platforms such as Aave, MakerDAO, Compound and Solend grew in popularity. There is currently $65 billion locked in DeFi lending platforms.  When a user wishes to participate in the DeFi banking system, they must interact with the protocol directly. This includes sending their crypto to the smart contract and managing the investment directly.  Crypto developers have been focusing on improving the user experience when interacting with this technology, but it still presents a unique challenge for investors. Many people who want to earn yield on their crypto positions are repelled because they cannot use a third-party service when interacting with a DeFi protocol.  Read more: Understanding DeFi and Its Importance in the Crypto Economy  CeFi as bridge between DeFi and TradFi  Because of these technological barriers, entrepreneurs saw the opportunity to create a “middleman.” Popular platforms such as BlockFi, Celsius, Voyager, among others, began offering “DeFi as a service,” or platforms that would only require users to deposit their coins with a central entity in order to generate yield.  These companies, often called “CeFi” (centralized finance) by the market, grew very rapidly because of their ease of use and a much simpler experience for novice users. They began marketing their services and quickly grew their assets under management.  The user experience in CeFi is much simpler, requiring one account for users, in order to start earning a yield on their crypto positions. These crypto companies would then lend out the money directly to borrowers, handling the crypto transfers, underwriting, etc. The users of the CeFi platforms would simply deposit their funds and then receive their income on a monthly basis.  An important difference between DeFi and CeFi is that when a user interacts with DeFi, they simply have to trust that the smart contract is written in a secure way. DeFi is peer-to-peer lending and does not require the same amount of trust as interacting with a CeFi company.  When a user deposits funds to a CeFi platform, many of the traditional banking risks exist, such as:  Solvency of the CeFi platform  Adequate underwriting standards  Meeting collateralization standards  Trusting the CeFi platform’s discretion when lending  When a user decides to use a DeFi platform directly, there is a higher level of technological knowledge that is required. The investor is required to be much more hands-on managing their own investments. DeFi is trustless and decentralized, which creates more confidence in the banking services because of the ability to audit the underlying smart contract code.  CeFi platforms essentially outsource the technological obstacles from the depositor to the institution, yet require the depositor to trust a central party and their lending practices.  CeFi warning signs erupt  CeFi platforms saw tremendous growth in 2020 and 2021. “DeFi as a service” grew in popularity and many of the CeFi platforms were managing billions of dollars on their customers' behalf.  In the summer of 2022, popular CeFi platforms Celsius Network and Voyager Digital froze customer funds. The lending standards of these platforms were not up to par and the companies lost many of their customers' funds.  This was due, in part, to extreme market conditions (the market cap of crypto has fallen nearly 60% from the high) and lack of proper risk prevention measures. Celsius and Voyager have since declared bankruptcy, causing depositors to have their accounts frozen and their ability to withdraw their money from the platforms restricted.  Read more: Behind Voyager’s Fall: Crypto Broker Acted Like a Bank, Went Bankrupt  Regulatory concerns are also impacting these centralized lending platforms. The popular platform BlockFi was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and fined because it failed to register appropriately with the SEC. BlockFi agreed to pay $100 million in penalties and are no longer able to offer yield to new customers. It is currently applying for the correct licenses and hopeful to offer the yield to customers with SEC approval in the future.  DeFi platforms, however, have been operating without issue. Aave and MakerDAO, among others, did not have the same struggles as the CeFi platforms, and are currently available to users.  DeFi or CeFi: Which should advisors and clients choose?  Investors are faced with a difficult situation: learn the technological knowledge required to interact with DeFi platforms individually or trust a CeFi platform with their funds.  The open-source smart contracts that DeFi platforms use may have a learning curve larger than simply using a CeFi platform. However, during difficult market conditions, the permissionless and trustless systems DeFi utilizes have proven to be a sustainable method for investors to generate income on their crypto positions.  Read more: Why DeFi Might Be Safer Than Traditional Finance  As an advisor, you must understand the risks associated with both DeFi and CeFi and the various services offered around the technologies.  Clients may express interest in generating a yield on their crypto positions, and it is important that advisors understand the risks and concerns associated with both ends of the spectrum – interacting individually with a DeFi platform and trusting a CeFi platform.  Perhaps CeFi platforms will soon be regulated businesses with investor protections and satisfactory risk management practices. But until proper protections are in place, learning to interact with DeFi platforms directly presents a unique and more transparent way to access these banking services.

42411076,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBzfN,1662641100,"Crypto Doesn't Need More Guidance, SEC Chair Gensler Says","The crypto industry does not need any specific rulemaking for projects issuing tokens, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler said in a speech Thursday.  Framing the issue as one of investor protection, Gensler said the rules and regulations that crypto issuers and service providers must abide by have been clear for years.  “Nothing about the crypto markets is incompatible with the securities laws,” Gensler said in his prepared remarks to the Practicing Law Institute. ""Investor protection is just as relevant, regardless of underlying technologies.”  His remarks are perhaps the clearest indication yet that the SEC intends to continue applying existing rules and regulations to the crypto industry, contrary to investors' and entrepreneurs' hopes that the agency will create some sort of carve-out that will let startups issue tokens without having to register as a securities platform.  Gensler also reiterated his view that “most crypto tokens are investment contracts” in his speech, and pointed to past SEC publications such as the DAO report and the Munchee order as guides that developers and entrepreneurs can and should follow.  “Some in the crypto industry have called for greater ‘guidance’ with respect to crypto tokens. For the past five years, though, the commission has spoken with a pretty clear voice here,” Gensler said. “Chairman [Jay] Clayton often spoke to the applicability of the securities laws in the crypto space.”  “Not liking the message isn’t the same thing as not receiving it.”  Gensler echoed these remarks in an interview with CoinDesk previewing Thursday’s speech.  There are more than 10,000 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap, with differing amounts of liquidity and value but all seeing similar approaches from the investing public, he said.  “[The public is] investing for a better future, based upon the efforts of others,” Gensler said. “There's websites you go to, there's Medium posts that you read, there's Crypto Twitter, there's Reddit forums and places you can look for information. And it's about that common enterprise and that entrepreneurial effort, which is the hallmark of investment contracts, which are securities.”  ‘Intermediaries’  Later in his speech, Gensler took aim at intermediaries in crypto, looking at both centralized and decentralized platforms.  “Crypto intermediaries – whether they call themselves centralized or decentralized (e.g., DeFi) – often are an amalgam of services that typically are separated from each other in the rest of the securities markets: exchange functions, broker-dealer functions, custodial and clearing functions and lending functions,” he said in the speech.  These trading platforms should abide by rules that protect their users, Gensler said, noting that they operate order books and facilitate transacting in cryptos, which may be securities. This last aspect “makes them brokers.”  Gensler pointed to attorneys hired to represent crypto entities as another example of how these projects may be in line with traditional securities platforms.  Read more: As SEC Leans on Enforcement to Regulate, Crypto Lawyers Study Every Word  “I’m going to guess that you had a client. I’m going to guess that you did not take on the work on behalf of a dispersed, unidentified group of individuals in an ‘ecosystem,’” Gensler said in his speech.  Asked whether the SEC would bring enforcement actions against trading platforms that refused to voluntarily register with the agency, Gensler pointed to the agency’s past enforcement actions, which have largely focused on token issuers.  “We are a cop on the beat,” he said. “That’s what Congress set up in the 1930s, but we work with market participants and … quoting Joe Kennedy, the first chair of the SEC, ‘no honest business need fear the SEC.’”  Bankruptcy concerns  In his speech, Gensler only briefly mentioned lending companies, saying they fall under his agency’s jurisdiction if they are offering securities.  He emphasized the possible dangers to investors in his conversation with CoinDesk, noting that several have filed for bankruptcy and frozen customers’ access to their funds.  Even companies that haven’t filed for bankruptcy have still frozen user access to their funds, he said.  “There’s basic protections in our securities laws that guard against that,” he said. “If you're investing in any one of these, these service providers, platforms, you're not getting those basic protections insuring against fraud, manipulation, what's called front-running.”  Gensler pointed to the SEC’s settlement with crypto lender BlockFi as an example of how companies could register with the agency, though he declined to speak about any other specific companies (noting he could speak about BlockFi as that is a settled matter).  Read more: Grayscale, Disclosing SEC Queries, Says Cryptos XLM, ZEC, ZEN May Be Securities  The SEC is still sorting through the rest of the crypto lending space, he said, but in his view it’s “unambiguous” that lending platforms have to register with the agency.  “It doesn't matter what you hand over to a platform, if you hand over gold, if you hand over bitcoin [BTC] or you hand over any one of 1,000 plus alternative coins, frankly, if you hand over chinchillas. That the platform is taking those funds of value and doing something with it – they might be operating a hedge fund, they might be lending it out, they might be operating other investment schemes – but that platform is under the securities laws book because of how they've taken that money from you,” Gensler said.  Stablecoins  Gensler’s chief message – that crypto activities are already covered by existing regulations and do not need new laws or rules of their own – was repeated throughout his speech.  Stablecoins – cryptocurrencies whose values are pegged to that of a real-world asset, such as the U.S. dollar – exemplified this, and are another area where investor protections are important, Gensler said in his speech.  Stablecoins may be securities, depending on how their peg is maintained, whether they pay interest and how they’re sold, Gensler said.  “This is by no means an exhaustive list. The point is, it is important to look at the facts and circumstances of a product, not its label, to determine whether it is a crypto security token, a crypto non-security token, or another instrument,” Gensler said in his speech.  Read more: Biden Administration to Congress: Put Stablecoins Under Federal Supervision – Or We Will  He told CoinDesk that he intended to work with the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury Department on this issue.  More broadly, he said he intends to work with companies and service providers but reiterated that he saw the SEC’s role as being “a vigorous cop” overseeing the crypto sector.  “If we're successful, there'll be more trust in these markets and investors will get to decide and entrepreneurs will decide and projects will win or lose or fail based on their inherent risk,” he said. “...

Coinbase has continued to expand its staking offering and recently announced support for institutional clients, adding staking for cardano (ADA) and solana (SOL), and will eventually support ether (ETH) after the Merge, Goldman analysts led by Will Nance wrote.  The Merge, or the switch from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, is the first of five planned upgrades for the Ethereum blockchain and is expected to happen next week.  Read more: Crypto Exchange Coinbase to Offer Liquid Staking Token Before Ethereum Merge  Goldman sees Coinbase generating $250 million to $600 million in additional staking revenue from ether staking, assuming that around 20% to 40% of the ETH on its platform is staked.  The bank joins a JPMorgan analyst, who said last month that Coinbase is in a position to be a “meaningful” beneficiary of the Merge as the exchange’s staking offering will drive revenue for the company.  Goldman also expects upside from higher interest rates from USD coin (USDC), and it noted that as the sole retail issuer of USDC, Coinbase gets a share of the interest income generated from the USDC reserves. Given that interest rates are expected to reach over 3.5% over the next few quarters, the market is underestimating the roughly $400 million to $680 million worth of “boost to subscription and services revenues and ultimately adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).”  Despite these positive catalysts, the bank maintained its sell rating on Coinbase shares and its price target of $51, citing weakness in the core business.  “We remain sell rated as we believe the profitability profile is likely to remain weak given the depressed trading environment and the company’s target for roughly break-even margins over the intermediate term,” the bank’s analysts wrote.  The shares of the crypto exchange have fallen more than 70%, while bitcoin lost about 60% of its value this year, according to TradingView data.  Coinbase's stock was recently trading at $69.24.

Bitcoin (BTC) prices were stable on the announcement, which follows a 0.5 percentage point rise announced in July as Europe faces up to significant inflation and energy shortages in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.  The decision takes the interest rate on the main refinancing operations, which provide the bulk of liquidity to the banking system, to 1.25%.  In general, crypto markets are less affected by decisions taken by the ECB and its U.K. counterpart, the Bank of England, because it’s the Federal Reserve’s decisions on the U.S. dollar that have a greater impact, analysts have previously told CoinDesk.  The announcement may also have been priced-in by markets after ECB executive board member Isabel Schnabel said in an August speech that she favored “robust” action that could head off greater economic damage later on.  As such, the ECB's latest move demonstrates that global liquidity tightening is in full swing, which weakens the case for bullish revival in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

Binance Labs, Coinbase Ventures, Circle Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners and the crypto wing of Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) were among the participants, Mysten announced Thursday.  The size of the fundraise demonstrates that appetite for investment in crypto and blockchain projects has not been greatly diminished despite the crash in the crypto market in recent months. Talks of the latest funding round were reported in July, when sources for The Information said that investors had committed $140 million.  Mysten Labs will use the funding to build out its Sui blockchain and expand into Asia-Pacific.  The startup was founded by veterans of Novi Research, the crypto research division of Facebook parent company Meta (META). CEO Evan Cheng was head of research and development for Meta's crypto wallet initiative.  Mysten Labs raised $36 million in Series A funding led by a16z last December.

The product is an over-the-counter (OTC) dark pool that services institutional clients, and will include know-your-customer (KYC) protocol. The platform currently supports trading of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), Avalanche’s AVAX, and Circle’s USD coin (USDC), with more to be added.  “This is the first truly cryptographically provable, fair, and neutral marketplace,” Enclave CEO David Wells told CoinDesk. As exchange operators, explained Wells, Enclave has no visibility into customer order flow prior to it hitting the order book. The platform also doesn’t doesn’t contain internal market makers or preferential access, he added.  Thanks to being a stablecoin-based product (as opposed to fiat), Enclave Cross can operate in several jurisdictions without licensing, though the company is in the process of applying for licenses in instances where it’s needed.  Enclave wants to use technology to solve the aforementioned trading issues, said Wells, and the growth of institutional interest in crypto has opened doors for this type of platform.  “Since all assets and trades are being held and executed off-chain, others in the marketplace will see only when funds are withdrawn from the platform, reducing the impact of a time mismatch of buyers and sellers,” Wells said in a statement Thursday.

It plans to use the funds to expand its team and bolster its stablecoin through developing the protocol.  Hubble aims to create a Solana-based equivalent of MakerDAO: a DeFi protocol with a U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin. Whereas MakerDAO is an early Ethereum-based DeFi protocol that allows users to trade its native stablecoin, DAI, Hubble users can borrow and mint USDH, Hubble’s native stablecoin.  In its plans to expand, Hubble co-founder Marius Ciubotariu told CoinDesk it will hire Solana developers to help build out the protocol. It’s also planning to incorporate Kamino Finance, a Solana-based product that “bootstrap[s] liquidity” by helping users transact with USDH.  The latest funding round follows a $10 million dollar raise in January led by Three Arrows Capital, DeFiance Capital and Digital Currency Group. Digital Currency Group is the parent company of CoinDesk.  Ciubotariu told CoinDesk that Hubble aims to support DeFi lending in the Solana ecosystem amidst a climate of uncertainty surrounding stablecoins and DeFi protocol security. After Terra’s native stablecoin UST's death spiral in May and the hack of DeFi protocol Acala last month caused the native stablecoin to fall 99%, Hubble is hopeful that it can learn lessons from the past several months to develop a secure protocol with a truly stable coin.  “A stablecoin itself has a time tested mechanism. There have been many attempts to design stablecoins and we've seen how they have failed or they didn't manage to scale,” said Ciubotariu. “The game we need to win is network effects and trust. So we have to do it by showing good risk management practices.”",POSITIVE,DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | LUNA | MKR | SOL | DAI,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/08/hubble-protocol-raises-5m-to-expand-solana-based-defi-protocol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5bbb14e49e19de745cae21f4ef9dd147f97ba1e8-2115x1586.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a court filing obtained by CoinDesk, users were able to siphon off the bitcoin with Canadian dollars that were en route but not yet received by Coinberry, following a bug in Coinberry’s Interac e-transfer software update.  “On April 13, 2020, Coinberry implemented a software update to the Coinberry Platform. Unfortunately, the said update contained a vulnerability whereby Coinberry’s system was notified of e-transfers of CAD despite the fact that the moneys had not actually been received by Coinberry,” the lawsuit read.  The lawsuit filed by Coinberry, which was acquired by crypto marketplace WonderFi (WNDR) in July, also names the Binance crypto exchange, as it was a venue several customers used to transfer approximately 9.48 of the misappropriated BTC.  Initially over 500 customers exploited the vulnerability, with 37 bitcoins being returned following a request from Coinberry.  “Coinberry contacted all of the said 546 affected registered users by email and demanded return of the misappropriated bitcoins,” the lawsuit read. “Coinberry also immediately contacted Binance.”  The lost funds raises questions over the risks firms take when handling irreversible assets like cryptocurrencies. Last week, a Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol lost $660,000 worth of crypto when it made a programming blunder.  On Aug. 25, Coinberry's parent company, WonderFi, applied to start trading on the Nasdaq. It currently trades on the Toronto Stock exchange.  Coinberry did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  The Financial Post initially reported on news of the filing.

42422365,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0kcXh,1662631577,"Celsius Crypto Borrowers Call for Bankruptcy Trustee, Oppose US DOJ Move to Appoint Examiner","A group of Celsius Network borrowers wants a bankruptcy court to appoint an independent examiner to investigate the crypto-lender’s financials, but not one working for the U.S. Trustee office.  Celsius filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this summer. Its attorneys maintain that the company can recover with the aid of a still-being-built mining operation. The U.S. Trustee’s office, a division within the Department of Justice, petitioned the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York last month to let it appoint an independent examiner, saying the company is not being transparent about its financial situation.  Four Celsius borrowers – Zaryn Dentzel, Gregory Kieser, Joseph Eduardo and Michael Conlan – said in a Wednesday court filing that while an independent examiner should be appointed, this person should not come from the Trustee’s office.  “The borrowers are concerned that the wide scope of the examination proposed by the U.S. Trustee will significantly delay the resolution of this case. Given the current monthly cash burn in this case, this delay will cost the estate tens of millions of dollars,” the filing said.  The borrowers also said they would like the examiner’s focus to be on maximizing the funds recovered, rather than Celsius’ past behavior. To that end, the borrowers asked the court to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee.  “It is painfully apparent that the Debtors [Celsius, the associated entities and its leadership] do not believe in transparency,” the filing said.  The Trustee’s effort to appoint an examiner, however, received support from state regulators probing Celsius.  Vermont’s Department for Financial Regulation (DFR) boosted the Trustee’s claims Wednesday, announcing in a filing that Celsius’ liabilities may have exceeded its assets for as long as three years, excluding the company’s CEL token holdings – which DFR alleged Celsius manipulated to bolster its balance sheet.  The regulator went so far as to imply that Celsius operated like a Ponzi scheme, saying the company’s admission that it did not generate enough revenue to support its yield product “shows a high level of financial mismanagement and also suggests that, at least at some points in time, yields to existing investors were probably being paid with the assets of new investors.”  Read more: Celsius Resembled Ponzi Scheme at Times, Vermont Regulator Says",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/08/celsius-crypto-borrowers-call-for-bankruptcy-trustee-oppose-us-doj-move-to-appoint-examiner,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4e6c7003f9c899b7392b04aedbbc2316e1ca1454-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Hits $18,000 There are several reasons for Bitcoin&apos;s bearish run, but most refer back to the Federal Reserve&apos;s aggressive approach to inflation. Rising Bond Yields: the US 10-year bond yield has risen 3.25% since June, as sell-offs continue to increase. Investors are playing it safe as a result.

Per statistics, fan tokens like $LAZIO, the fan token of Lazio football club in Italy, and $PSG of the Ligue 1 giant Paris Saint Germain, are defying gravity and have been posting double-digit gains in the last few trading sessions. Notably, $LAZIO dominates the leaderboard, surging approximately 50 percent in the previous trading week alone. Considering fundamental factors and rising confidence by market analysts that the crypto winter might be coming to an end after nine grueling months, the fan token rally could just be getting started. The pump in fan tokens&apos; valuation coincides with the resumption of the 2022/23 session in most top European leagues. These coins are purposefully designed to strengthen the ties between fans and the team. Partnering clubs are permitted to mint them on the dedicated Proof-of-Authority (POA) Chiliz network.

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) like Aave rely on community votes and proposals to determine their path. Decisions are made by token holders, who vote on issues, new developments, growth plans and other issues proposed by their communities.  “We propose that the Aave DAO retribute a total of $16.28M in retroactive funding to Aave Companies for the development of Aave Protocol [version 3],” Aave Companies wrote in a proposal to the Aave’s governance forum.  While the proposal isn't scheduled to end until early U.S. hours Thursday, it has already reached quorum, with nearly 100% of votes supporting the funding. Community discussions on the governance forum were generally positive and supported the proposal.  The total includes $15 million for work performed directly by the team over the course of more than a year, with the rest required for costs paid to third-party audit services. Some 60% of the compensation would go to engineering-based roles, and 40% to non-engineering roles, such as design and product management.  The funding will consist of $5.4 million spread over stablecoins DAI, USDT and USDC, $1.1 million in other unspecified stablecoins, $3.3 million in “more volatile crypto assets” and $6.2 million in Aave’s native AAVE tokens.  Contributors to the Aave protocol included development firms BGD Labs, Certora, SigmaPrime, Llama, Gauntlet and Aave Companies, the proposal noted.  The v3 upgrade went live in March. It introduced cross-chain “portals,” isolated markets, a “high efficiency” mode and other features for a better user experience to compete with rival decentralized finance (DeFi) products in the crypto market, as reported.  Portals, one of the biggest improvements, allow users to swap assets from any blockchain on which Aave is deployed. Users can create “aTokens” – which represent deposits into Aave – on one chain and burn them on another. This feature opened up the possibilities of on-chain trading strategies, such as yield arbitrage, or taking advantage of the varying yields offered by the protocol on different blockchains.",POSITIVE,AAVE | DAI,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | DAI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/08/aave-companies-seeks-16m-from-dao-funds-to-pay-crypto-developers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b63dea5f1777a825569ecd1e4695fac2b2a11f6e-1456x1092.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cryptos Rally Late Wednesday  By James Rubin  Cryptocurrencies found a late spark Wednesday to regain ground lost in a plunge little more than 24 hours earlier.  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $19,300, up more than 2% for this period after falling to $18,558 on Tuesday, its lowest level in two months. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now struggling to maintain support above $19,000 as investors shrink from the same Federal Reserve monetary hawkishness and macroeconomic uncertainty that have plagued riskier assets for months.  ""There was probably a lot of period of time for bitcoin where the macro factors probably didn't matter, but to the extent that the goal is to be more mainstream, the more mainstream it becomes, the more it's affected by mainstream things,"" Noah Hamman, CEO of investment management company AdvisorShares, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program.  Ether continued its recent trend of outperforming bitcoin, rising nearly 6% to trade over $1,630 as crypto markets recovered some of their excitement for the Merge, which shifts the Ethereum blockchain from proof-of-work to more energy-efficient proof-of-stake. On Tuesday, the second largest crypto in value had plummeted below $1,500 for the first time in more than a week.  Among other major altcoins, ALGO, the token of proof-of-stake, carbon-negative blockchain network Algorand, recently rose more than 6% after the company announced a protocol upgrade. YGG and CRV jumped more than 12% and 11%, respectively.  Equity markets  Equity markets closed higher amid at least a temporary lull in risk-averse sentiment with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 both spiking about 2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) climbing nearly 1.5%. On Wednesday, markets received fresh signals that the Federal Reserve Reserve will approve a third consecutive 75 basis point interest rate hike with several Fed officials in separate speeches reiterating the bank's commitment to tame inflation. The Fed has boosted interest rates at its fastest pace in about four decades.  “We are in this for as long as it takes to get inflation down,” Fed Vice Chairwoman Lael Brainard said Wednesday in a speech at a banking conference in New York.  In her remarks, Brainard also said the cryptocurrency market bears similar risks to traditional finance, but will need new regulations for situations not covered by existing laws. Given the unique characteristics of crypto, there's a need for “creating clear regulatory guardrails,"" she said.  Brainard also restated her position about the risk of stablecoins. “Stablecoins is one of those areas that I think has the most potential for risk if not properly regulated and of course those risks can easily spill into the main core financial system because of the runnable nature of stablecoins,” she said.

Insights  Why DeFi Companies Are Targeting Institutional Investors  By Shaurya Malwa  SEOUL, South Korea – Decentralized finance (DeFi) companies are increasingly targeting a sector they once looked to usurp: traditional finance players and institutional investors.  The shift is interestingly consistent. Ethereum lending projects Aave and Compound started offering institutional versions of their products in 2021, while Maker brought an SME loans platform called Monetalis into the Maker fold, with Maker as the sole backer – despite token holders’ opposition.  The offerings are not lowball efforts arising from a bear market either. A cohort of “institutional DeFi” (decentralized finance) is growing at a significant pace as well, as per reports. Some research firms even peg the niche sector to attract over $1 trillion in capital from investors over the next five years.  Such moves are a shift from the past ethos of DeFi, which formed in the deep bear market of 2019 as an antidote to TradFi, or traditional finance. A then-sparsely populated Telegram group – just called “DeFi” – had budding protocol builders and users discuss and envision a world where smart contracts wholly govern the supply of finance to users, one where TradFi had no reach.  The Telegram group counted among its many participants the-then unknown developers and investors such as Synthetix's Kain Warwick, Yearn's Artem K, DeFiance Capital's Arthur Cheong and Compound's Robert Leshner, among several others, who have since evolved into DeFi superstars. But developments of today are a near 180-degree shift from that TradFi-free world.  Going 'where the growth is'  What changed? As per Maker developer Nik Kunkel, it's all about “where the growth is.”  “If you go to an institution, they're gonna borrow $100 million. We have people who want to borrow a billion (dollars) from us,” Kunkel said during August’s BuildAsia conference in Seoul. “Trying to get that critical mass of retail users that you need to get $500 million in total loans is really difficult, right?”  Kunkel added that the cost of user acquisition for a retail participant remains high, as opposed to marketing products to institutions that provide a “better bang for your buck” in terms of where a project spends its resources.  The sentiment was seconded by Doo Wan Nam, founder of governance-focused crypto fund StableNode. “Many DeFi ecosystems have been aware that user base as well as liquidity can be greatly enhanced via working with TradFi,” Doo told CoinDesk.  The likes of Doo say DeFi is not that far off from its promise either. “I would also add that a lot of DeFi ethos was also about educating and revolutionizing the current financial system – which is still applicable,” he said over a Telegram message.  Still, Maker’s Kunkel says the recent push for institutional catering doesn’t mean that the project isn’t about retail anymore.  “There's different initiatives to serve different purposes. So I think on the growth side we're looking more towards institutions, but when it comes to “banking the unbanked,” and that's where layer two comes in,” Kunkel said.  It's too expensive to use the Ethereum blockchain for transactions, he said, adding, “You can't tell someone in Africa or someone in Paraguay that they need to spend $20 on gas costs. That's not feasible.”  “That's where the push for layer two [companion blockchain] comes in,” Kunkel noted, adding that fees on such systems were “less than $1 right now” and that future simulations run by the team show that transaction costs gradually “become insignificant.”  Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1, or base, blockchains. This software bundles multiple off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, which helps reduce the data load, leading to faster network transactions at lower costs.
