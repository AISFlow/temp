42403582,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgLzn,1574809210,US Judge Refuses to Quash IRS Summons for Bitstamp Exchange Records,"A federal judge denied a Washington state resident’s petition to stop the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from gathering data about his bitcoin holdings from the Bitstamp exchange.      In a ruling Monday, Judge John Coughenour of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington instead ordered the IRS to narrow the scope of a summons it had issued to Bitstamp.      The ruling is notable because the judge rejected two arguments likely to resonate with cryptocurrency users, especially cypherpunk early adopters: that the petitioner had a constitutional right to financial privacy, and that third parties (in this case, the tax collector) cannot be trusted to safeguard sensitive personal information.      According to the order, William Zietzke filed the petition to quash the IRS summons on Bitstamp, after the agency began an audit of his cryptocurrency holdings and transactions following the filing of an amended tax return.      Zietzke filed a $104,482 capital gain for 2016, with two bitcoin transactions apparently making up the bulk of the funds. However, he realized in 2017 that the transactions did not occur in 2016, and filed an amended return showing a capital gain of only $410 and requesting a refund of taxes he'd paid.      In response, the IRS began auditing his cryptocurrency transactions, identifying the various services he used, including Bitstamp, whom the agency issued a summons to determine how many transactions and how much bitcoin Zietzke sent through the exchange since opening his account.      The judge agreed with Zietzke’s argument that the summons was overly broad, but rejected his other arguments, which included that the IRS’s summons were issued in bad faith; that the IRS already has the information it needs; that the IRS “failed to follow the administrative steps” required by law; that the summons violated his Fourth Amendment rights to a reasonable expectation of privacy; and that the government cannot ensure it secures any data it collects from Bitstamp.      The judge threw out several of Zietzke’s arguments on technical grounds, noting that the IRS is conducting an audit of his holdings and transactions, which satisfies legal requirements for showing a legitimate purpose, and writing that there is no evidence to suggest the IRS is acting in bad faith or taking too long to audit him.      The judge’s order told the IRS to narrow its request to only those transactions conducted in 2016.    Fourth amendment    Dismissing Zietzke’s argument that he had a right to privacy preventing the IRS from gaining access to his public keys or addresses, the judge cited the landmark 1976 ruling in United States v. Miller.      In that case, “the Supreme Court held that a person lacks a reasonable expectation of privacy in a bank's records pertaining to the person,” Judge Coughenour wrote.      While another case (Carpenter v. United States, 2017) also addressed privacy and seemingly conflicted with Miller, the Carpenter case was primarily about surveillance, and therefore the Miller precedent stands, he wrote.      As for the argument that the IRS “is unable to adequately secure such highly sensitive information,” Judge Coughenour was candid and direct.      “This is, to put it bluntly, not a legal argument,” he wrote.      The IRS now has two weeks to file an amended summons to Bistamp, with Zietzke getting a week after that to respond.      Neither Bitstamp nor Zietzke immediately responded to a request for comment. IRS spokesperson Dean Patterson declined to comment, saying, “federal law prohibits the IRS from discussing specific taxpayers.”      Despite Zietzke’s efforts, the judge’s ruling suggests that the IRS will collect the information it is looking for eventually, to conclude its audit on the Washington resident.      “As with many things in life, cryptocurrency transactions have tax consequences,” the judge wrote.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/26/us-judge-refuses-to-quash-irs-summons-for-bitstamp-exchange-records,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f028a889cacc3d9b4a8d14ae3da1f34769572061-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking at the Caixin Hengqin Forum in Zhuhai, former head of the People’s Bank of China Xiaochuan Zhou said the country will stress the retail use of digital payment for the digital yuan, according to a media report from Caixin.      “There are two goals for international digital currencies,” Zhou said. “The first one, which is also what China envisions is to develop digital payment and its use for retail system in the country, while the other goal is to cross-border payment for international financial institutions.”      According to Zhou, these two goals will require different technical designs for the digital yuan, and China might expand its capabilities once it implements the digital payment function in retail.      Zhou said China is a difficult environment to test out the new digital currency, and a country with a smaller population could be better since the cycle for currency circulation is shorter.      “In case there is something wrong, it will be easier to steer the boat into a different direction,” he said.      Though Zhou is no longer working as the head of the Chinese central bank, his speech could be a meaningful message from the authorities in terms of how the bank will launch the digital currency DCEP (Digital Currency, Electronic Payment).      The Chinese government has traditionally sent soft signals from former senior officials before making formal announcements, said Mable Jiang, a partner at Nirvana Capital, a Beijing-based venture capital firm specialized in financial technologies.      “I think this is an important signal that China would start pushing retail use of DECP hard in some economies that fit Zhou's description about smaller population and good internet infrastructure,” Jiang said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/26/chinas-digital-yuan-will-target-retail-payments-first-ex-central-banker-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/141f97d7439c1472942dc9ea429b6c04ce5a7a2b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403575,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgLvr,1574789408,How to Earn and Spend Bitcoin on Black Friday 2019,"The holiday shopping season is upon us, and bitcoin users now have more opportunities than ever before to spend and earn their digital loot.      Many cryptocurrency exchanges slash rates and trading fees over the long Thanksgiving weekend in the U.S. Plus, Binance US CEO Catherine Coley said the exchange’s referral program, for traders helping friends sign up, will double rewards to $30 per sign-up during the period.      It’s also a prime time to shop for hardware products. The crypto wallet-maker Ledger has a 30 percent off sale for all products sold through its website. The node issuer Casa is also offering $100 off lightning network nodes with a gold membership, roughly a 25 percent discount.      Yet there are still ways to earn and use bitcoin even when shopping for the nocoiners on your Christmas list – even beyond tech companies like Microsoft, which accept bitcoin directly.      Here are a few ways to shop like a bitcoiner:    1. Support small businesses    Several lingerie retailers, like Kala, and boutique butchers, like Primal Pastures, accept bitcoin payments and ship nationwide.      The London-based book publisher Kiosk accepts bitcoin payments and runs its own full node via BTCPay. Since the publisher started accepting bitcoin in May 2019, roughly 15 customers have paid with crypto, said Kiosk founder Nick Greenbank.      “It has definitely helped expand my knowledge of Bitcoin, and my technical knowledge more generally,” Greenbank said of using BTCPay. “I know from personal experience that they are a very friendly bunch and are always more than happy to help you out if you get stuck with anything along the way.”    2. Shop with crypto using wallet apps    Thanks to a variety of crypto startups, it’s now relatively easy to spend bitcoin at mainstream retailers that don’t transact directly in digital currency.      Mobile apps like Fold and Flexa allow users to spend digital assets in brick-and-mortar stores. The latter supports zcash, ether, litecoin and Gemini’s stablecoin GUSD as well, for shopping at retailers like Nordstrom, Barnes & Noble, Express, GameStop, Office Depot and Whole Foods.    3. Earn bitcoin while shopping with fiat    As for Fold, the payments startup offers credit card and bitcoin payment options, both of which earn shoppers modest bitcoin rewards. Of those purchases made so far, conducted by a few thousand users, roughly 30 percent paid with the app’s Lightning Network option. Fold can be used for purchases at Amazon, Starbucks and Target, among other brands, both in-person and online.      The invite-only beta app processed nearly $250,000 worth of payments since it started in October 2019, out of which 60 percent paid in fiat, Fold CEO Will Reeves said. The public mobile app launched on Monday.      Beyond Fold, there are also several other ways to earn cryptocurrency while spending fiat.      The in-browser Lolli app offers bitcoin rewards from brands like Sephora, Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s. By Cyber Monday (the first business day after Thanksgiving, when retailers encourage online shopping) the new rival Chrome extension StormShop will offer cash-back rewards in the form of ethereum-based stablecoin DAI. Simon Yu, CEO of StormX, the company behind StormShop, told CoinDesk that 5,000 people signed up for the app's beta mailing list. Users will be able to cash out rewards in bitcoin, ether, DAI, or StormX's native token.      As a bitcoiner who has worked in the industry since 2014, Yu said this year the market is ripe for cryptocurrency fans to earn or spend digital assets during the holiday shopping season. MakerDAO donated $10,000 in DAI to StormX so that Yu's startup can distribute an extra $5 worth of rewards to the first 2,000 users who cash out in DAI.      “You’re seeing a lot of the brands shifting away from the in-store deals with people standing in line...to an online presence,"" Yu said.

According to a report from Tech Crunch, a company spokesperson said: ""We’ll be winding down operations at Omni and closing the platform by the end of this year."" Omni has made no announcement on Twitter, however, and its blog site is not operational at press time.      It was reported in October that Coinbase was in talks to acquire Omni's engineering team to further development of its educational project Coinbase Earn. That news came as Omni was reportedly laying off staff as it struggled to make profits after selling its physical storage business in May, TechCrunch says.      Coinbase has now taken on the dev team, according to the report, with a spokesperson saying:    ""Coinbase has reached an agreement with Omni to hire members of its engineering team. We’re always looking for top-tier engineering talent and look forward to welcoming these new team members to Coinbase.”    Last year, Omni raised $25 million in a funding round led by Ripple executives Stefan Thomas and Chris Larsen, who invested directly with the XRP cryptocurrency. The firm has reportedly raised $35 million all told.      The company had started off as a kind of Uber for personal storage, collecting items from users' residences and holding them in a warehouse until needed again. Its low fees proved to be too low for a viable business, though, the report says.      It then moved on to offering a platform for users to rent out items they were not using, before morphing the service again into a similar rental service for stores, but those too failed to bring in sufficient revenue, according to TechCrunch.",NEGATIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | XRP,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/26/ripple-backed-rental-firm-omni-shutting-down-with-coinbase-snapping-up-dev-team-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/32bdcc1974cb1fb15d2fcf27d896d4adbbdc1e18-1500x895.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a document signed by District Judge P. Kevin Castel at the New York Southern District Court on Monday, Durov's deposition should take place on Jan. 7 or 8, 2020, at a location ""agreed upon by the parties."" That would be a little more than a month before Telegram is scheduled to meet the SEC in court to dispute the legal status of the gram token, which the SEC considers an unregistered security.  Telegram vice president Ilya Perekopsky, who was reportedly responsible for communications with investors during Telegram's $1.7 billion token pre-sales last year, should also be questioned on Dec. 16 in London, the order states.  The third person listed to provide pre-trial testimony is Shyam Parekh, a Telegram employee who's name was on Telegram's letters to investors that were leaked after the SEC sued the company, one of the investors told CoinDesk. Parekh's deposition will be held on Dec. 10, also in London.  The SEC sued Telegram in October, demanding that the messaging app company's blockchain project TON be halted and the tokens allocated to the project's investors not be distributed. The regulator said that Telegram woul flood the U.S. market with unregistered securities and make them available to retail investors.  Telegram disagreed with the SEC, arguing that it properly registered the token sale under Regulation D, and the token itself, once issued, ""will merely be a currency or commodity,"" not a security. It has recently asked the court to drop the SEC action, rejecting all the allegations by the agency.  However, the company agreed to postpone the project's launch, previously scheduled for the end of October, until April, 2020, so the SEC case can be resolved. TON investors approved the delay, refusing an offer of a partial refund.  The project has been still been progressing in the background, however, releasing the code for the TON blockchain nodes in early September and instructing the investors to generate their public keys and send them to the company for the scheduled gram token distribution. The team has also released a desktop wallet app for grams, running so far on its test network.  Several exchanges have previously signaled their readiness to list grams, including Coinbase. According to court filings, a major custody provider for grams, Gram Vault, has also filed paperwork for listing the token on Poloniex.  Binance CEO Chanpeng Zhao (CZ) recently told CoinDesk he believed projects like Libra and TON cannot be stopped by regulatory actions.

42403571,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgLtt,1574770800,Another Crypto Exchange Is Dropping Privacy Coin Monero Over Compliance Risk,"A Northern European digital assets exchange is to delist the privacy-focused monero cryptocurrency to align with international anti-money-laundering standards.      Estonia-based BitBay announced Monday that monero (XML) will no longer be tradeable from Feb. 19, 2020. However, the crypto exchange is to cease deposits of XML as of this Friday, Nov. 29, and will block withdrawals temporarily from Friday to Dec. 5 around the time of a planned monero hard fork.      All users must withdraw any remaining XML by 20 May, 2020, according to the notice.      Explaining the move, BitBay said monero is being delisted due to its privacy features. The cryptocurrency uses tech called ring signatures that jumble up small groups of transactions to obfuscate individuals' identities.      ""The decision was made to block the possibility of money laundering and inflow from external networks,"" the firm said, adding that other crypto exchanges have dropped monero over the same concern.      ""As a licenced exchange, BitBay has to follow the market standards. Compliance with market standards and regulations allows us to provide our clients with legal security and convenience of using the exchange, with the participation of a friendly banking system and the availability of payment operators,"" BitBay said.      As mentioned, monero's privacy protections have led to other trading platforms halting support in recent months. For example, OKEx Korea dropped XML, as well as horizen (ZEN) and super bitcoin (SBTC), in October. It said at the time it was reviewing a decision to delist zcash and dash as well.      Other privacy coins have been seen as too risky by some exchanges too. Coinbase dropped zcash from its U.K. platform in August. The move was likely a compliance push related to building a new banking relationship after being dropped by Barclays.

42403558,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgLj4,1574768100,Ripple Finalizes $50 Million MoneyGram Investment,"Payments startup Ripple has completed the acquisition of its $50 million stake in remittance platform MoneyGram, the companies announced Monday.      According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple, in its final payment, bought $20 million of MoneyGram equity at a price of $4.10 per share, more than a dollar per share over the stock’s current price of around $3.00. Monday’s investment completes a deal first begun in June 2019.      With the completion of the deal, Ripple owns just under 10 percent of MoneyGram’s outstanding common stock, “and approximately 15 percent on a fully-diluted basis including non-voting warrants held by Ripple,” the filing said.      Under the original deal, Ripple made an initial $30 million investment, while MoneyGram in turn agreed to utilize Ripple’s products for cross-border settlements.      According to the filing, MoneyGram intends to use this capital inflow to support its operations, in particular as it expands its use of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity product, the renamed xRapid payment system that utilizes the XRP cryptocurrency.      Since June, MoneyGram has begun using XRP to conduct transactions in Europe, Australia and the Philippines, and currently transacts roughly 10 percent of its Mexican peso foreign exchange trading volume, the filing said.      In a statement, MoneyGram chairman and CEO Alex Holmes said the partnership was “transformative,” noting that the company could settle transactions “in seconds.”      “This initial success encourages us to expedite expanding our use of On-Demand Liquidity,” he said. “I anticipate furthering our growth into new corridors and exploring new products and services.”      Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, added that his firm would support MoneyGram’s “further expansion” into the European and Australian payment corridors.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/26/ripple-finalizes-50-million-moneygram-investment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6aa9dbc01928378ee3333b1c3327423af17ad11-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403570,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgLrv,1574766256,"As Bitcoin Bounces Back Above $7K, Popular Analysts Say Monthly Close Is Pivotal","Bitcoin has charted a relief rally in the last 24 hours, yet it still needs to rise by more than $1,000 in the next three days to invalidate bearish pressures, according to prominent analysts.      The recovery from six-month lows around $6,500 had been expected, with key indicators reporting extreme oversold conditions and intraday charts flashing signs of seller exhaustion.      While the bounce is encouraging, a bullish reversal is likely still a way off.      ""Bitcoin needs to close above $8,300 by the end of the month or we'll likely have a bearish December to test new lows,"" popular market analyst and Adaptive Fund partner, Willy Woo, tweeted during the Asian trading hours.            The top cryptocurrency is currently changing hands at $7,200 on Bitstamp, representing a 10.5 percent rise from the six-month low of $6,515 registered on Monday.      Essentially, bitcoin needs to rally more than 15 percent and print a UTC close above $8,300 on Nov. 30, or a bearish engulfing candle will be created on the monthly chart.      A bearish engulfing pattern consists of a green candlestick, representing a price gain, followed by a large down (black or red) candlestick that eclipses or ""engulfs"" the previous candle, as seen in the chart below.            On the monthly scale, BTC opened at $8,300 on Oct. 1 and closed at $9,150 on Oct. 31, forming a green candle. The follow-through has been dismal this month. Prices opened at $9,158 on Nov. 1 and are currently trading near $7,200.      Essentially, November's price drop has engulfed the October candle's body – the spread between open and close.      The bearish setup will be confirmed if bitcoin ends November below $8,300 (October's opening price). That would imply a resumption of the sell-off from the June high of $13,880 and could invite stronger selling pressure, possibly yielding a deeper drop below $6,000.      That said, bearish engulfing patterns have trapped sellers in the past, according to Woo. So, sellers should observe caution even if the bearish pattern is confirmed – more so, as BTC has already dropped by more than 50 percent in the last five months and could recover some ground ahead of the miners reward halving, due in May 2020.      While Woo is citing $8,300 as the level to beat for the bulls, Michael Novogratz, the billionaire CEO of Galaxy Digital, feels bitcoin needs to break above $7,500 to avoid being stuck in the less pleasant $6,000–$7,400 range.            A move above $7,500 in the next couple of days could be seen and may yield rise to $8,000. The outlook, however, will remain bearish as long as the cryptocurrency is trapped in a five-month falling trendline seen below.    Weekly chart          A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above the upper edge of the falling channel, currently at $8,990, is needed to confirm a bullish breakout, which, if confirmed, would mean a resumption of the bull market from lows near $4,100 seen in early April.      Realistically, bitcoin is more likely to form a bearish engulfing candle, as prices usually consolidate near lows for some time after a notable sell-off. This is because investor confidence tanks during a bear market and takes time to recover.      All-in-all, the crypto is likely to trade in the range of $7,500 to $6,500 over the next few days. Any gains above the descending 10-day moving average, currently at $7,628, will likely be short-lived.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/26/as-bitcoin-bounces-back-above-7k-popular-analysts-say-monthly-close-is-pivotal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b811384eab502693a8bc811a9139b74030bb7f1c-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

C Labs has recruited Jai Ramaswamy to bring his extensive anti-money-laundering (AML) and financial crime detection experience to the firm, the company announced today.      Ramaswamy was most recently the head of enterprise risk management at Capital One, where he focused on the bank’s international risk exposure. Before that, he was managing director and global head of AML compliance risk management at Bank of America.      “I’m interested in helping [C Labs] understand its overall risk profile,” Ramaswamy said.      Prior to his stint in the private sector, Ramaswamy was the chief of asset forfeiture and money laundering at the U.S. Department of Justice, where he led the prosecution of financial institutions for money laundering and sanctions violations.      He represented the DOJ on illicit financial issues affecting national security, including engagement with the U.S. Treasury Department, law enforcement, the intelligence community and financial regulators.      He also led the DOJ's efforts to monitor virtual currency use by transnational criminal organizations and to prosecute the facilitation of criminal activity by exchanges.      This experience gives C Labs the advantage of being able to understand not only the DOJ but also the many different U.S. financial regulators that work with the DOJ to tackle financial crime, Ramaswamy said.      “The industry is trying to figure out how to deal with this technology in ways that traditional regulation has potentially not thought about or where principles have to be extended in areas that are somewhat novel,” he said.

42403574,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgLus,1574758800,Tokenized Real Estate Falters as Another Hyped Deal Falls Apart,"The Takeaway:    Removing the friction from real estate deals with tokens was expected to instantly attract institutional money and liquidity, but things are moving slowly.  A high-profile joint venture between technology startup Fluidity and broker-dealer Propellr was quietly shelved in the summer. Both are now working on separate tokenized loan projects involving multi-collateral Dai.  A $20 million tokenized real estate deal derailed earlier this year, was down to the issuer, trading giant DRW Holdings, not seeking permission from the senior debtholder to transfer ownership.  The SEC closely reviewed Factor 805, a tokenization of Brooklyn condos which incorporated MakerDAO’s stablecoin Dai, and later gave the project the all-clear.    Here’s a reality check – or realty check, as it were – for tokenization evangelists.      The idea of combining blockchain tokens and U.S. real estate was peaking at the start of this year, with college dorms, ski resorts and swanky Manhattan apartment blocks lined up to redefine the commercial mortgage market.      Following 2017’s initial coin offering (ICO) circus, a second wave of grown-up investors would raise capital and issue loans using blockchain-based tokens, and in the process disintermediate an army of middlemen and bankers.      A regulated approach, offering so-called security tokens to select groups of investors, would breathe frictionless liquidity into real estate’s legacy system of finance.      Such high expectations (and hype) were epitomized in a joint venture between technology providers Fluidity (backed by Consensys chief Joe Lubin and Galaxy Digital’s Michael Novogratz) and digital asset-focused broker-dealer Propellr.      Extensive media coverage at its launch included a video on Bloomberg featuring celebrity real estate broker Ryan Serhant (star of the cable television show “Sell It Like Serhant”) discussing the fresh pastures tokenization might bring.      However, the seismic disruption of the multi-trillion dollar real estate market so hotly anticipated hasn’t happened.      Underscoring the disappointment, the Fluidity and Propellr project was quietly shelved earlier this year. The joint venture was never officially consummated and the firms have since gone their separate ways.      Neither side would discuss the specifics of the venture’s cancelation. But both agree that the tokenized market wasn’t ready for the real estate use case.      “The market was just too young at the time,” said Sam Tabar, a co-founder at Fluidity. “It didn't have sufficient institutional appetite.”      He described the Propellr partnering as “a contemplated joint venture” in which Fluidity was to be a minor shareholder.    Adverse selection    As it stands, trading of private placements and structured transactions in assets like real estate is infrequent and the price is typically lower than net asset value.      Tokenization was seen as a way to remove friction around the transfer of ownership and stimulate liquidity in secondary markets.      Security token offerings (STOs), which are regulated financial instruments, are a workable fit for the tokenization of real-world assets such as real estate - at least on paper.      Making use of an exemption in U.S. securities law called Regulation D, STOs operate like private placements, typically allowing smaller companies to raise capital by selling equity or debt securities to select investors without going through the arduous registration process.      The only thing missing from this brave new token economy was institutional capital to come piling in.      “Tokenized real estate came with an embellished promise,” said Todd Lippiatt, CEO at Propellr. “It came from a place where people were actually mixing verbiage. From my personal perspective, what they were claiming as liquidity, is really market access.”      Institutions want to see liquidity before they will go ahead and re-engineer their entire back office. Meanwhile, issuers have to get tokens into the market to prove their thesis, leading to a chicken-and-egg problem.      Instead of institutional participation, the hype led to a kind of “adverse selection” phenomena, said Lippiatt, attracting people who didn’t have a better option to raise funds, or who had spent a lot of money building blockchain token infrastructure and wanted to follow through with one of their own projects.      “I think at one point we had $3 billion worth of interest in tokenization,” Lippiatt said. “But once you started to sift through it all, there was a bunch of people who wanted to raise money for really bad deals.”    Harbor’s hiccup    Fluidity and Propellr are in good company when it comes to hiccups and rethinks.      Also earlier this year, a deal to tokenize $20 million worth of student housing put together by blockchain startup Harbor and the real estate arm of Chicago-based trading firm DRW Holdings fell apart, as was first reported by the Block.      According to one person familiar with the situation who spoke to CoinDesk, a basic goof derailed the deal.      The parties overlooked a no-transfer clause that was written into the mortgage on the property, and the holder of the senior debt, Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank, did not grant permission to transfer ownership.      A spokesman for Harbor, which has since pivoted from crowdfunding to a pure technology provider role, confirmed that “the lender would not assent to transfer of the loan,” but added that “the issue was not related to tokenization.”      Neither DRW, the would-be token issuer in the deal, nor U.S. Bank, the lender, replied to requests for comment by press time.      (In April, Evan Lapiska, a spokesman for the bank, told CoinDesk it no longer had “a current or active interest” in the property, known as the Hub at Columbia in South Carolina.)      Depending on how you look at it, enthusiastically charging out into the market armed with a subscription book and some blockchain technology, speaks to the immaturity of this new investment paradigm and the ongoing clash between the old ways and the new.    OK boomer    Since turning its attention away from tokenizing apartment blocks, Fluidity has shifted its focus to other areas where traction is happening, Tabar said.      It has been working on a Tokenized Asset Portfolio, exploring decentralized loans using the MakerDAO multi-collateral Dai system and pledging U.S. Treasuries as collateral. A new Fluidity product is expected to come out next month.      In the end, Tabar’s prognosis on the calcified nature of the real estate market comes down to a broad generational impasse.      “Baby boomers who are still in the seats of power don't want change at this point in their careers. They just want the system to remain the same so they can extract as much value out of it and have a nice retirement,” he said.      During the time their firms worked together, Lippiatt and Fluidity co-founder Michael Oved co-authored a white paper analyzing the problem tokenization was trying to solve around private placements, and a possible solution, dubbed the Two Token Waterfall.      The proposal involved two separate tokens: one senior in priority of payments replicating debt and the other junior in priority of payments replicating equity. The idea was to bring a complete accounting of a transaction to the token layer so that a security could really be valued.      “It's not just equity in real estate,” said Lippiatt. “You own the real estate minus whatever debt is owed plus whatever cash flow comes in, the history of payment and so forth. All of this goes into how one might want to evaluate something.”      Looking back, this close attention to detail (plus having compliance requirements encoded into smart contracts), availed the firms when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) came knocking.      Lippiatt recalls the tokenization of a loan on a Brooklyn-based apartment block called FACTOR-805, which was the first real-world asset to incorporate Dai, the MakerDAO stablecoin.      Accepting Dai as well as fiat and distributing Dai as interest payments, attracted the attention of the SEC, which visited Propellr (a registered broker-dealer) and spent several hours interviewing the team and reviewing the transaction.      “Middle of August we had another interview with them [SEC] and they said, ‘we take no exception in the way that you did this deal.’ In other words, ‘we approve.’ So hopefully we helped create policy,” said Lippiatt.    Hope springs eternal    Looking ahead, Propellr remains focused on MakerDAO and the potential of multi-collateral Dai, working on a tokenized mortgage pilot with Berlin-based Centrifuge (“the sort of blockchain partner I was looking for,” said Lippiatt).      “I think we are at the end of Act 1. Act 2 will bring better protocol layers; it will solve some of the privacy issues that people are concerned with, especially in the mortgage landscape,” Lippiatt said. “It’s a long play and hopefully it won’t turn out to be a tragedy.”      There are still a number of interesting projects chipping away at real estate, including the likes of Securitize, AssetBlock, Fundament, Smartlands, Bits of Property to name just a few.      Having evolved from its earlier crowdfunding model, San Francisco-based Harbor has recently helped tokenize $100 million worth of real estate funds in conjunction with the manager of those funds, iCap Equity.      “There is stuff in production,” said Harbor CEO Josh Stein. “We have clients with tokenized securities and there have been some trades in real estate. Is it flying off the shelves? The answer is no.”      Stein acknowledged there might be some disappointment when compared to all the hype, but said the situation is not actually bad at all and rather resembles the look of normal technology adoption.      “We’ve moved on from where people could just yell the word ‘token’ and investors would throw money at it,” he said.

42403573,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgLsu,1574730059,BNY Mellon Aims to Go Live 'ASAP' on Trade Finance Blockchain Marco Polo,"Bank of New York Mellon has joined the Marco Polo trade finance consortium running on R3’s Corda, becoming the 28th bank to do so.       The $373-billion asset bank is evaluating Marco Polo’s technology with the intention of onboarding clients if the network’s capabilities fit clients’ interests, said Joon Kim, global head of trade finance at BNY Mellon.       “Our hope is that the business requirements of our clients will meet with what Marco Polo has to offer, and our intention is to move into live production A-S-A-P,"" Kim said, meaning ""as soon as possible.""       Kim wouldn’t reveal how many corporate and bank clients are receiving trade services from the bank, but said that BNY Mellon works with 1,400 financial institutions in total.       For banks around the globe that want to create their own trade operations but don’t want the hassle of developing a new division, BNY Mellon offers white-labeled trading services. In September of this year, the bank announced at the annual Sibos conference that it had expanded its trade services with KeyBank, a U.S. regional bank with $416 billion in assets.       Trade finance is a “critical” part of BNY Mellon’s transaction banking business, which also consists of payments and liquidity products, Kim said.       BNY Mellon chose Marco Polo because the blockchain works well for open account financing, which makes up around 85 percent of trade finance, and works well for large corporates, Kim said. (In open account transactions, the goods are shipped and delivered before payment is due; with letter-of-credit financing, the bank guarantees a buyer’s payment ahead of time).       Among the other blockchain trade finance consortiums that Kim said BNY looked at but didn’t serve the bank’s needs, Voltron is designed around letters of credit, and we.Trade serves small to medium enterprises.       Founded by blockchain companies R3 and TradeIX, Marco Polo aims to create real-time settlements and transparency in trading relationships. In September, Bank of America and Mastercard joined the network. The network executed its first Russia-Germany transactions in October of this year.       BNY Mellon has interacted with R3’s Corda in other contexts. In October 2017, the bank participated in a marketplace with four other banks that uses Corda as a hub for administering syndicated loans.       The bank is also dipping a toe in the crypto space. In April, BNY Mellon began digital asset safekeeping (different than digital asset custody) by providing private key storage for bitcoin futures exchange Bakkt.       BNY Mellon has also been tapped to be the administrator and transfer agent for shares of the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust being sold to institutions as well as Bitwise’s proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/26/bny-mellon-aims-to-go-live-asap-on-trade-finance-blockchain-marco-polo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b4b15fef4a5087c5f0e57eb948a865d2f732571-1448x819.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
