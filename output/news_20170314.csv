42399662,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNmi,1489527322,Code Bug Exploit Sends Bitcoin Unlimited Nodes Offline,"Nearly 70% of nodes running Bitcoin Unlimited went offline today as word emerged of a bug in the software's code.  The bug opened a vulnerability through which a certain kind of message sent to nodes could cause them to be taken offline. Nodes are responsible for validating the transactions on a blockchain, maintaining a copy of the transaction history's entire record and essentially enforcing the rules of the network through the code.  The issue was originally flagged on GitHub by BU developer Peter Tschipper. Details then spread on social media, sparking widespread commentary from both supporters and critics of the project.  That discussion – and highlighting of the bug – was followed by an apparent exploit that sent the node count plunging. BU developers have since moved to release a patch for the bug.  During the attack, the BU node count slipped to as low as 252, according to cryptocurrency data site Coin.Dance, while data site Bitnodes showed roughly 265 nodes online at the time.  In total, as many as 780 BU nodes were online prior to the drop, data from Coin.Dance shows, and as of press time, 240 BU nodes are online. To get a sense of the scale, roughly 6,100 nodes make up the bitcoin network's global ecosystem, according to Bitnodes.  BU is an alternative implementation of the bitcoin software, which among other changes seeks to put in place a user-configured transaction block size as a means to scale the network. The software project emerged amidst the wider debate over ways to scale the transaction capacity of the network.  BU has drawn both strong supporters and sharp critics, with some arguing that it provides a path to scale the network while others have criticized its approach to expanding the block size.

42399651,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNYw,1489515718,Nasdaq is Helping Build a Blockchain Market for Ad Contracts,"Exchange operator Nasdaq is helping to launch a new blockchain-based market for advertising contracts.  The New York Interactive Advertising Exchange, or NYIAX, has positioned the forthcoming exchange release as a transparent means for buyers and sellers to trade digital media, the company said in an announcement released today. Nasdaq is providing the technology that will power the exchange.  Though it didn't get into specifics, the firm indicated that it will utilize proprietary technology, deployed in the cloud, using blockchain as the ""core ledger"" for transactions in the market. And while no full launch date has been revealed, NYIAX said that it aims to complete a pilot program by late 2017.  The goal, the company said, is to seek to streamline the $32bn market for media advertising by securitizing advertising contracts.  Richard Bush, NYIAX's chief product and technology officer, said in a statement:  ""Trading, a vital part of other market sectors, has now come to media. With the ability to trade guaranteed media contracts, advertisers and publishers can now be efficient and rid themselves of unnecessary costs and risks. NYIAX is leveraging our Nasdaq Financial Framework architecture, which draws on cutting-edge technology, including the integration of blockchain technology as our core ledger, as well as cloud-enabled trading and clearing capabilities.""  The launch comes months after Nasdaq began offering blockchain-based services to its exchange clients. It's also been testing blockchain-based voting in Estonia, the early results of which Nasdaq has said seem promising from an operational standpoint. In 2015, Nasdaq launched Linq, a private market powered by the tech.  The exchange operator is also one of a number of firms worldwide to seek patents related to blockchain. Last year, Nasdaq filed a patent application for ""systems and methods of blockchain transaction recordation"" as a means to streamline the post-trade archiving process.

The digital currency's price has remained above this level in spite of notable headwinds, specifically the rejection of the bitcoin ETF proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and the ongoing debate over how best to address the digital currency's perceived technical limitations.  Bitcoin prices first crossed the $1,000 mark roughly halfway through 14th February, and reached one month above this level at approximately mid-day today, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  During this month-long period, bitcoin primarily followed a steady, upward trend, making numerous attempts at breaking $1,300, BPI data shows.  Shortly after the SEC announced its decision, the currency plunged, falling nearly 30% from roughly $1,290 to $1,022.68, its low on the BPI, though single exchanges may have seen sharper declines.  At the time of report, bitcoin is trading at $1,249.64, roughly 25% above the $1,000 mark, BPI figures show.

42399655,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNfp,1489507210,EU Law Enforcement: Digital Currency is Impeding Investigations,"Law enforcement agencies in the European Union are alleging that the growing use of digital currencies is impairing their efforts.  Europol, the EU's top police agency, and Eurojust, an agency focused on cross-border judicial matters, released a joint paper on 13th March that outlines a series of cybercrime challenges they face. According to the paper, 2016 was a year that saw a rise in the number of investigations involving the tech, though the agencies didn't provide specific figures.  Yet that usage is having a material impact, according to Europol and Eurojust.  The agencies state in the paper:  ""...the widening criminal use of decentralised virtual currencies and the increased use of tumbler/mixer services, effectively prevent law enforcement to ‘follow the money’ and significantly complicate the possibilities for asset recovery and the prevention of fraudulent transactions.""  It's a significant admission from the Europol perspective, as the agency regularly partners with others on education and training efforts. (It inked a cooperative deal with blockchain analytics startup Chainalysis in early 2016.)  The paper also comes as lawmakers in the economic bloc are advancing legislation that could lead to the creation of a central database retaining information about digital currency users.  The two agencies later outline how a lack of cohesive legislation about digital currencies – and an absence of case law – further hamper law enforcement efforts.  ""Case law (jurisprudence) can be a valuable tool to compensate for a lack of specific legislation, but unfortunately little case law exists with regard to new developments (eg virtual currencies, anonymization tools and various technology-driven criminal modi operandi),"" the paper concludes.

In a new blog post, the startup said that it would now look to prioritize MassPay, a service launched in 2015 that uses the bitcoin blockchain as a payment rail.  According to Snapcard, the shutdown will begin next week, during which time it will push for its users to move funds off-site.

42399649,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNau,1489496467,How the 'Dole Stock Crisis' is Reigniting the Push for Blockchain,"Earlier this year, a rare window opened into the way the stock market currently operates when a class action lawsuit revealed that there were recently 12 million more shares of Dole Foods than the company thought existed.  The events that led up to the publication of a judge's opinion on the matter last month, it turns out, were in many ways a symptom of the way the system was designed to operate. Via a series of rare circumstances, the lawsuit exposed its weakness in the starkest of terms.  What exactly happened, and why, still remains largely unclear. Even the presiding judge stated in his official statement that it wasn't his problem, opting to leave the final division of the class action award up to the counterparties in the agreement.  But he did something else that was kind of extraordinary.  In the memorandum opinion dated 15th February, Delaware Chancery Court vice chancellor J Travis Laster offered a potential solution in a footnote at the bottom of the ninth page of the 16-page document: blockchain.  Specifically, Laster mentioned the US state of Delaware's Blockchain Initiative, describing how the solution still being developed might have prevented the massive discrepancy.  Also an advocate of blockchain voting, the chancellor's diagnosis that blockchain tech could provide ""a single and comprehensive stock ownership ledger"" coincides with the rapidly growing movement of many financial infrastructure providers to embrace the technology.  One of the first entrants into this burgeoning field working to move stocks to a blockchain was Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who in 2004 first encountered the so-called 'slop' in the financial system resulting from two main issues: 1) it takes three days for a trade to settle, and 2) the beneficiary of a stock rarely ever actually owns the stock, but rather an IOU.  What makes the Dole case unique, however, is that the lawsuit peeled back the metaphorical curtain that typically obscures this process, and by revealing the disorder, reignited a push by blockchain startups to bring order to the system.  Byrne describes the Dole discrepancies as an ""expression"" of the way the current system is ""architected"", adding that without a certainty of how many stocks actually exist at any time, the price people are paying is little more than a guess at the actual value.  Blockchains, Byrne argues, both clarify who actually owns the stock, and make the time between when a stock is sold, and cleared, nearly instant.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Byrne said:  ""To the extent shares get turned into blockchain shares, none of that Dole stuff can happen.""  Phantom shares  Which brings us to Dole.  In 2013, the then-publicly listed Dole Foods was taken private by its CEO, David Murdock, at a rate of $13.50 per share to be paid out to stock owners. However, in response to a class action suit by those same stockholders (who alleged that the shares were actually worth more), the Delaware Chancery Court ordered Murdock to pay an additional $2.74 a share, with interest.  The problem was that, even after a review process revealed that some of the claims filed were false, there were about 49 million 'facially valid' stocks appearing to qualify for the additional funds. Dole only had a record of about 37 million shares.  One explanation for the discrepancy is the so-called 'chill' period instituted by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which is the actual owner of record for most of the stocks traded in the US, even while others benefit from the dividends (as is nicely explained by Matt Levine for Bloomberg).  During a transition from a public to a private company, trades under the terms of a chill are allowed to continue, but for accounting purposes, the DTCC ignores them, possibly helping explain in the discrepancy.  Another possible explanation, in the opinion memorandum proffered by Laster, is the practice of short-selling, when stocks owned by one party are loaned to another, perhaps without their knowledge.  One of the results of such short-selling is the appearance of two legitimate owners of the stock at any given time, otherwise known as 'phantom shares'. Careful manipulation of these shares can be very lucrative to those who know how.  Byrne said:  ""Those forces are going to fight because they want the slop to stay, because that’s their profit.""  In fact, when Byrne launched his own blockchain solution, called tØ, in October 2014, he argued that one of the main reasons for building the platform was to ensure that the actual owner of the stock benefited from any interest generated through its lending.  After years of development, the tØ platform executed its first blockchain-based stock transactions on 16th December, 2016, using a portion of Overstock’s own preferred stock options to demonstrate its functionality  But no other company has so far offered stocks on the blockchain platform and the shares currently being traded represent such light volume that, on some days, it appears that almost nothing has changed hands.  Official option  That could all change, though, if the project mentioned in Laster's opinion letter gains traction.  Underpinned by blockchain startup Symbiont's enterprise-grade Assembly blockchain, the Delaware Blockchain Initiative has a plan to standardize the ability for companies going public to do so on a blockchain.  Symbiont’s president and chairman of the board, Caitlin Long, described the project to CoinDesk as one that will ""give the option, not the requirement"" for publicly traded companies to offer their stocks on a blockchain.  ""As companies register via the ledger, that means that their share issuance will happen automatically with their corporate registration,"" said Long. ""You will never have a separation between the beneficial owner and the record owner of securities.""  Unlike Byrne (whose own struggle against short-selling and other versions of slop in the system is widely documented), Long, a former pension fiduciary, argues that the looseness of the current financial system isn’t necessarily intended to deceive.  She explained that prior to digitization, investors for pension funds and other investment vehicles were required to allow audits that proved they owned what they said they owned.  But, as the process moved increasingly online, the speed of transactions made such audits impractical. What remains today, she argues, is simply an old system created by the DTCC to make the market more efficient.  Long described the Dole discrepancy:  ""There wasn’t anything nefarious, per se, it’s just that’s the way the market works. The securities trade three days after the trade occurs and when you’re closing a merger you can’t settle today’s trades with shares that come in tomorrow.""  Unintended consequences  Exactly how much is wasted as a result of such slop is hard to quantify, in part because most of this type of confusion is resolved outside of the courts.  What distinguishes the Dole case is that only a few disputes ""bubble up to the nature of this one where there’s public disclosure and litigation,"" Long said. But that doesn’t mean the private costs of litigation don't still take their toll on the system.  ""It creates a lot of unintended consequences,"" she said. ""Aside from just the operational issues that I’m alluding to, where the system doesn’t keep perfect track.""  In addition to the armies of middle- and back-office employees that are employed by Wall Street and buy-side firms to help clean up such messes, there's other waste in the system too.  For example, the SEC's 'Regulation AB' requires that trustees must be given access to a list of stock beneficiaries, in order to ask them questions and perform other due diligence.  But such a list is almost impossible to provide as a result of the divorce between the owner of record and the actual beneficiary. As a result, cases like Dole ""scare the heck out of long-only investors"" with fiduciary responsibility, who can be held personally accountable to such ""settlement failures"", Long said.  As part of her own personal and professional mission to help prevent similar discrepancies from occurring in the future, Long indicated she has taken two recent meetings with insurance commissioners, and that Symbiont is preparing to reveal a related project, adding:  ""This is very much personally, philosophically, a problem that I would like to fix.""  'Nefarious' manipulation  While Symbiont and the State of Delaware prepare their own solution, Overstock's is already live. But traction, so far, is far from promising.  Three months after Overstock kicked off the era of blockchain-traded stocks by raising $10.9m with a stock issuance on Medici’s tØ platform, not a single other company has followed suit.  Because the transactions are logged on a public blockchain, we can see that a particularly busy day in February saw a meager eight transactions processed.  Considering that fewer shares were offered on the blockchain when compared to those offered on Nasdaq, Medici president Jonathan Johnson said the volume is ""about the level we expected.""  But he’s not shy about why he thinks the transition might be slow going. ""Those that figure out how to make bad things happen, whether they’re illegal, or legal — titularly legal — they like confusion and dark places.""  Johnson called the official explanation of why the extra Dole shares existed ""fishy"", and added that, if not for the legal dispute, the discrepancy would likely have continued to be exploited.  ""People that had been acting nefariously in manipulating the stock, didn’t expect the sunshine of this class action suit and settlement to be put on it,"" said Johnson.  ""And when the lights came on, they were caught with their pants down.""  Change from within  Since Patrick Byrne first announced his intentions to build the tØ blockchain solution, however, a lot has changed.  In addition to parting ways with members of Counterparty (the team that later spawned Symbiont), the same kind of financial infrastructure providers that generated Overstock's ire have become leaders in the space.  In particular, the DTCC, which emerged in the early 1970s to help solve the paper crisis around the increase of stock trading frequency, has proved it is still interested in evolving, and in January, announced it would move records for $11tn-worth of derivatives to a blockchain.  Similarly, US stock exchange Nasdaq and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) are both also in advanced stages of their own blockchain efforts, just to name few.  However, when Johnson read the Dole decision last month, he told CoinDesk it was a ""clarion alarm bell"" alerting him to a renewed sense of urgency.  ""We kind of feel like Jonas Salk,"" said Johnson. ""We've injected ourselves with the polio vaccine and it worked. Bad things did not happen.""  He concluded:  ""Now, the key is getting others to see the benefits of that polio vaccine. It doesn’t have a downside, and once there’s greater adoption, then I think it becomes easier and easier for more people to join.""

42399652,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNbt,1489492822,CoinDesk Explainer: The Bitcoin Unlimited Debate,"Depending on who you ask, Bitcoin Unlimited is either the future of bitcoin or a broken implementation of the software.  One thing's for certain, though, the controversial alternative to Bitcoin Core (the technology's standard software implementation) has drifted to the heart of bitcoin's raging scaling debate over the past year.  To summarize an admittedly complex debate, each side wants to increase capacity of the network, but they want to do so by different methods.  In today's climate, running or supporting Bitcoin Unlimited is basically synonymous with desiring one such method: a tweak to bitcoin's block size parameter, set at 1MB today.  What is Bitcoin Unlimited?  Bitcoin's code is public for anyone to read or copy ('fork') for their own project. As such, it's possible for different versions of bitcoin to run side by side on the network.  Bitcoin Unlimited  differs from Bitcoin Core in that the block size parameter is not hard-coded – nodes and miners flag support for the size that they want. Then, it relies on an idea called 'emergent consensus'.  ""An emergent consensus will thus arise based on free-market economics as the nodes/miners converge on consensus focal points, creating in the process a living, breathing entity that responds to changing real-world conditions in a free and decentralized manner,"" the website reads.  In the case of the block size, the idea is that via the free market, miners will come to agreement on a block size. Though, users can 'vote' on other parameters as well.  Who’s involved?  While a larger community has cropped up around Bitcoin Unlimited, there are a few key players.  Investor Roger Ver has been one particularly eager supporter, even launching a small mining pool, Bitcoin.com, around the effort.  Other bitcoin mining pools, such as ViaBTC and Antpool, operated by mining giant Bitmain, are also now signaling support.  As far as the technical community goes, Bitcoin Unlimited chief scientist Peter Rizun is possibly one of the better-known individuals to generate ideas for the Core alternative. From outside the community, others, such as former Bitcoin Core maintainer, Gavin Andresen, have said positive things about it too.  What's the debate?  There are many in the technical community who feel the Bitcoin Unlimited might not be a safe replacement for Bitcoin Core.  Some developers, such as Luke Dashjr and David Vorick, argue that the approach doesn't work at a technical level.  One reason they give is that the software hands miners too much control over protocol decisions. (Some even argue that this is a key reason that some big mining pools back the effort.)  Another, is that many developers think that 'emergent consensus', in practice, would lead to blockchain forks (the creation of different and competing versions of the network).  Meanwhile, there has been at least one problem with the software. A month back, one buggy Bitcoin Unlimited upgrade led Ver's pool Bitcoin.com to lose 13 bitcoins when it created a block that was not accepted by the network.  What's next?  Antpool is the latest of several bitcoin mining pools to signal for Bitcoin Unlimited, but its support (while not new) is all that significant.  Bitmain, its operator, has an outsized position in China's bitcoin mining scene (it's one of the only major manufacturers of hardware in the region), meaning its support is likely to carry through its business partners as well.  Currently, approximately 2.5% of users are now running a Bitcoin Unlimited node, but some think Bitmain may have the power to influence this figure.  Right now, this method of voting isn't active. There isn't a activation date or hashrate threshold put in place yet, but if users and miners begin using the new Bitcoin Unlimited rules, it could split off into another coin and begin living by these new rules.  Some in the ecosystem fear that such a fork – if implemented poorly – could create two bitcoin blockchains, and two publicly traded bitcoins operating on blockchains with different rule sets.  Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated Bitcoin Unlimited's activation threshold. This has been corrected.

42399656,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNcs,1489489205,Another Bitcoin ETF Deadline is Already Approaching,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to make another bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) decision later this month.  New York-based startup SolidX revealed last July that it was filing to list a bitcoin ETF on the New York Stock Exchange, seeking to sell as much as $1m worth of shares. The firm raised $3m in late 2014 in a bid to sell financial products tied to the digital currency.  Yet the SEC delayed a decision on that proposed offering in September, punting forward a determination until 30th March.  As the agency said at the time:  ""The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change.""  According to the SEC website, its public comment period will last through 16th March. (The proposal hasn't garnered any input since 3rd March.)  The deadline is notable given the SEC’s rejection last week of a proposed rule change that would have cleared the way for a bitcoin ETF backed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. That effort, too, faced delays as the SEC sought to collect insight from potential stakeholders.  The rejection of the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF – and the agency’s justification for doing so (a lack of market surveillance and broader concerns about regulation in the bitcoin space) – could potentially threaten the chances of a positive decision for SolidX ETF, as suggested by some commentators in the wake of that event.

42399648,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNZv,1489483803,Dubai Government Taps IBM For City-Wide Blockchain Pilot Push,"The city of Dubai has unveiled new strategic partnerships as part of its bid to become the world's first ""blockchain-powered government"".  At a press conference at Emirates Towers Hotel today, Smart Dubai, the city's innovation arm, announced that IBM has officially joined as its ""blockchain strategic partner"", while Brooklyn-based ethereum startup ConsenSys, in turn, will be its blockchain city advisor.  As part of the unveiling, Smart Dubai revealed how it intends to oversee the migration of Dubai's government processes to blockchain systems, a move that will find agencies as diverse as Dubai Tourism, the Dubai Health Authority and the Dubai Police leveraging the technology as part of a city-wide push to modernize and digitize by 2020.  In interview, Zeina El Kaissi, head of business development at Smart Dubai, discussed the strategy for the ambitious plan, comparing its complexity to ""driving a car and building the car at the same time"".  Still, El Kaissi is optimistic Dubai's government agencies could leverage operational blockchain pilots by next year, though she stressed the emphasis of the trials is the benefits this would bring to city residents.  El Kaissi told CoinDesk:  ""If we can address 10 to 15 experiences, not small services, and transform them via blockchain over the next two to three years, that would be huge.""  Also notable about the project is the governance and support Smart Dubai will provide to participating startups and blockchain service providers.  Whereas startups have often struggled to operate in the face of confusing and still-opaque global regulation, Smart Dubai revealed it will help shape details like the legal deliverables and cost assumptions of those participating as part of the program.  Given this support, El Kaissi expressed a confidence that pilots could be running hundreds of thousands of transactions by next year. She cited Dubai's small market size and willingness to embrace innovation as key enablers that could set it apart from other jurisdictions.  ""There’s no bureaucracy. We meet and we move,"" she continued.  The announcement follows a period of heavy activity for Dubai's blockchain ecosystem, which last week played host to a tech conference on the topic. There, leaders from government agencies and major banks discussed the state of the ecosystem, unveiled new proofs-of-concept and detailed roadmaps for new trials and tests.  Tapered rollout  At the event, Smart Dubai also revealed a go-forward strategy that will divide its plan of action over this year and next.  In the first phase, taking place from March to April of this year, the city's government intends to analyze challenges and determine issues that currently make life difficult for citizens. (Smart Dubai's overall mandate is to use technology to help make the city the ""happiest"" on earth).  Here, the government will provide hands-on guidance and support.  ""We'll design the architecture and the business case, and define the expected impact financially on the city and on the time and number of steps for users,"" El Kaissi explained.  From there, Smart Dubai said it will work on scoping request for proposals (RFPs) for its blockchain startup partners, with the first pilots expected to launched in August. Beginning in 2018, Smart Dubai envisions the launch of a blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that would enable startups to deliver services more effectively across the city.  The full migration would then seek to be completed by 2020, a vision first detailed by Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Crown Prince of Dubai, last October.  Technology play  Yet, the announcement also places Dubai's work in a larger, global context.  As competition heats up for blockchain infrastructure, many startups and incumbents have been embracing a 'multi-blockchain business model, one that finds them leveraging a mix of protocols to deliver services.  In this way, El Kaissi said the announcement of both IBM and ConsenSys as partners shows that Dubai intends to stay ""open minded"" about the technology and its various designs.  For example, while IBM routinely builds on its Fabric distributed ledger, overseen by the Linux-led Hyperledger group, ConsenSys is working on a private implementation based on the ethereum blockchain.  Here, El Kaissi stated that Dubai intends to be vendor neutral, noting the ""technicalities"" of both offerings.  She concluded:  ""There are going to be different types of use cases.""
