Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  Spanish banking multinational Santander (SAN) plans to offer crypto trading to its clients in Brazil in the coming months, Santander Brazil CEO Mario Leao said on Thursday.  The bank plans to launch crypto-related services and could provide further news about the initiative in the company's next earnings release, in mid-October, Folha de S. Paulo newspaper reported.  “We recognize that it is a market that is here to stay, and it is not necessarily a reaction to competitors positioning themselves. It is simply a vision that our client has demand for this type of asset, so we have to find the most correct and most educational way to do it,” Leao said.

42411434,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNl6o,1659049110,Building a Sports DAO: 4 Lessons From LinksDAO,"To say the momentum was electric would be an understatement. Just two weeks from conceiving the idea, we would sell 9,090 membership non-fungible tokens (NFT) at a total gross revenue of more than $10 million and build a community of more than 40,000 across all social channels. Collectively, we all have the same goals of building the world’s greatest modern golf and leisure club, buying one of the best golf courses in the world and fundamentally changing the game by making it more fun, democratic, inclusive and accessible.  Jim Daily is founder and CEO of LinksDAO, former advertising executive, co-founder of Teads and obsessive golfer. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's ""Sports Week.""  The LinksDAO project shows the speed and scale of Web3 technologies and applications and the power of people organizing behind common goals. I have learned a lot since starting this project with my friend Mike Dudas (co-founder of 6th Man Ventures and The Block) and our incredible family of founding members. I hope to share a few of these learnings with you all today.  Before we get started …  So we are all on the same page, I am going to simply define decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) as communities that are focused on common goals, with each member having aligned incentives and receiving governance rights that are recorded on-chain. They come in many shapes including exchanges (Uniswap), investment (Flamingo)and sports (LinksDAO, WAGMI United), and utilize the collective intelligence and productivity of a large group to achieve their aim.  Now that we have that out of the way, a bit of what I learned in the first seven months of LinksDAO.  Read more: For the Fans: How DAOs Could Change Sports  Community is everything  To have a successful project, you must keep this as your central philosophy. If you stay true to your mission and tap into the power of your community, your project will move quickly.  Our community at LinksDAO is self-organized into various PODs that tackle a number of subjects such as: engineering, marketing, partnerships, wen course, design and architects, events and so on. These PODs produce incredible things and drive the direction of the project (i.e., our engineering POD created proshop.linksdao.io, one of the first token-gated e-commerce sites on the internet).  In Web2, things are built by a group of employees, hired for specific jobs. In Web3, goals are achieved by 1,000s of builders that can choose their level of involvement and are compensated accordingly. This is an extremely powerful evolution of the work and productivity model and one that all DAO-based projects should consider.  Deliver, deliver, deliver  Huge ideas are exciting (“We are going to buy an NFL team!”) but delivering value for members sets the great projects apart from the pack and keeps everyone excited and engaged. The LinksDAO membership already receives major discounts, access and benefits from the likes of Callaway (ELI), Top Golf, 5i, Holderness & Bourne, William Murray, Ship Sticks, DraftKings and plenty more partners just for being part of the community. These benefits have made the LinksDAO membership more valuable than any digital golf subscription in existence and the project is only seven months old. Find your focus, build community and excitement, organize and deliver VALUE. Also, make sure that you know how your project is going to thrive past its formation. If you’re going to form a ski club DAO and buy a ski mountain, you better know how you’ll make money and keep it open for many years to come.  Transparency and over-communication  If you are in Web3 and your project is community-based, you are going to be doing most of your building wide out in the open. For the core team of any project, this can be daunting and difficult at times but you need to embrace it. Make sure that your core team is being transparent about what is being built, what is going well, what has been challenging and what the community can do to help the project move forward. Then over-communicate!  A perception of many DAO-based projects is that most folks in the community are online, in Discord and engaged every day. The reality is that everyone in the community has different levels of engagement. If there is a big vote, large piece of news or major development in your project, you will need to mention it more than 10 times across Discord, Twitter, Instagram, Podiums, Spaces, newsletters and carrier pigeons before most of your community sees it. Great moderators and mod bots really help on this point.  Doxxed founders and community meet-ups  If you want to create a meaningful project in this space, dox yourself. In my opinion, trust is key and trust can’t be anonymous. For the community, anonymity can be an attractive element of Web3 but plenty of your members will be thrilled to get together in person. We have already seen 1,000s of LinksDAO members coming together for big events in New York City and Austin, Texas, rounds of golf across the globe and self-organized regional meetups. The power of building real-world bonds within an amazing like-minded community is pretty extraordinary and helps any project keep its community really engaged.  Lastly, remember that (almost) no one has done this before. You are in a brand new space, creating brand new things with a group of future-minded folks. It’s wildly exciting but will be littered with speed bumps along the way.  There is no playbook for success. You are creating the playbook for your project and the projects that come after yours. Make sure that you remind yourself and your community of this along the way and you’ll have a lot more fun with a lot less FUD.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | UNI,Jim Daily,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/07/28/building-a-sports-dao-4-lessons-from-linksdao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0062c3c38eb14915a877526839fab1fea15b5cdd-3548x2661.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374135,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXx47,1659048529,What Is the Definition of ‘Recession?’ And Does Bitcoin Care?,"Recession – or the ""R word"" as politicians call it – pops up in everybody’s conversations these days, and with good reason.  Today’s gross domestic product report showed the U.S. economy shrank for a second consecutive quarter, and if you paid close attention in macroeconomics class, you’ll likely start panicking.  Many students of the economy learn at some point that “two straight quarters of declines” is tantamount to the definition of a recession. But it depends on who’s being asked. And these days, if you listen to policy makers, they’re pointing to an altogether different standard.  The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), which most analysts and U.S. officials defer to when determining the timing of economic cycles, says that a recession is defined by more than just GDP.  A recession is “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months,” according to the NBER. The inherent subjectivity gives policy makers, including the Federal Reserve, much-needed wiggle room – very different from the easy-to-classify “two quarters” definition.  “It was simple to understand, it was black and white,” said David Wessel, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution and former Wall Street Journal economics editor. “The NBER definition is kind of mushy, for good reason, because there are lots of factors.”  The NBER was created in 1978, and going back in history “two consecutive quarters of GDP decline” was the only definition that existed, Wessel said.  GDP could indicate how the economy is doing, but numbers often get revised, with the average revision over time being 1.5%. This is why the NBER’s approach could provide a more useful assessment even though, most of the time, the “two quarters” standard still works.  “The discrepancy between the output side and the income side is particularly wide in the first quarter of this year, and that leads some people to think that GDP is likely to be revised and may not actually be negative in the first quarter,” Wessel said.  Two assistant secretaries for the U.S. Treasury Department wrote a lengthy web post this week laying out what they described as “considerable evidence” that the “economy is not currently in a recession,” even if GDP contracted for two straight quarters.  A Fox News correspondent asked a White House spokesperson this week why President Joe Biden’s administration was “trying to redefine ‘recession’” when “we all understand a recession to be two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.” (“That’s not the definition,” the spokesperson said.)  Similarly, at a press conference this week a reporter asked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell if he would consider the U.S. economy to be in a recession if GDP declined in the second quarter.  “The Fed doesn’t make a judgment on that,” Powell said. “Though, if you think about what a recession really is, it’s a broad-based decline across many industries that sustain for more than a couple of months and there are a bunch of specific tests in it. And this just doesn't seem like that.”  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reiterated Powell’s point on Thursday, saying that a “semantic battle” about whether the country is in a recession should be “avoided,” and that a recession is a “broad-based weakening of the economy,” and “that is not what we’re seeing right now.”  What does this mean for bitcoin?  For traders of cryptocurrencies, and specifically bitcoin (BTC), the question is: Does it even matter at this point if the U.S. is in a recession?  The answer is most likely no.  “We're slowly learning that bitcoin is not a ’store of value’ but rather a ‘store of excess value,’"" said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at the digital-asset manager Arca Funds. “Whether or not we are in a recession is irrelevant.”  Negative wealth fueled by declining business confidence and spending, as well as business revenues results in less demand for bitcoin, Dorman said, but from a structural standpoint, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap is unaffected.  “Bitcoin is nothing more than a call option on a future where bitcoin is used as an actual currency in the face of declining confidence in fiat,” he said. ”As a result, bitcoin's price is simply a reflection of whether or not that probability increases or decreases, and from that standpoint, a recession could in theory increase the probability of investors looking for an alternative to government fiat.” Fiat is a term many crypto analysts use to describe government-issued cash that’s not backed by any physical commodities like gold.  Given that most markets, including the cryptocurrency markets, have already suffered major losses this year due to macroeconomic uncertainty, it remains to be seen whether calling this period a “recession” or leaving it without a label would matter.  “I don’t care for a recession,” said Bob Iacchino, chief strategist at Path Trading Partners and co-portfolio manager at Stock Think Tank. “You're just naming a period and naming an economic period, but I don't care if you name it. People are either hurting or not.”  Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies have rallied since Powell’s dovish press conference on Wednesday and Thursday’s GDP number. Bitcoin was changing hands above $24,000 late Thursday, up 8% over the past 24 hours.  “The risk markets rally may be prematurely pricing in a potential slowdown in rate increases in reaction to the negative GDP print,” said Paul Eisma, head of trading at XBTO Group.  “We are in a data-driven environment, so any economic numbers that hint at a slowdown in demand and growth, or easing of inflation, inflation expectations will be supportive of risk assets-including bitcoin, crypto.”  Compared with all that, the “R” word might just be a distraction.

42411442,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNlXG,1659046656,Why NBA Athletes Are Turning to Web3 to Build Generational Wealth,"Roughly 60% of former NBA players are broke within five years of hanging up their sneakers, according to a 2009 Sports Illustrated report. These financial problems aren't exclusive to the league. A reported 78% of former NFL players also go bankrupt or are under financial pressure only two years after retirement. Given the generally accepted reality that many of these athletes are from majority black and brown communities, and acknowledging that these communities tend to be disproportionately underresourced, it’s a serious issue that the people best positioned financially to invest in these communities – the ones who have “made it” – struggle, by and large, to retain and grow their wealth.  Now, as Web3 emerges as a technology with financial benefit, pro athletes have a chance to change this sad pattern of life in retirement. After all, NBA players in general are quick to adopt new tech and often lead the masses to adopt emerging tech. Think about the product marketing boom Beats by Dre experienced at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games when LeBron James outfitted the entire U.S men’s Olympic basketball team with the signature headphones. James, viewed by many as just an athlete at the time, was making quiet early investments in an emerging transformative product that delivered him an outsized financial impact to the tune of $700 million.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week. Marcus Bläsche is CEO and co-founder of Rumble Kong League, a competitive 3-vs.-3 basketball sports league in the metaverse for players, fans and brands.  “Buy low, sell high” has been a guiding principle for the stock market since before most of us can remember. James modeled this well with his early investment in Beats by Dre in 2008. Today, Web3, the metaverse and the crypto industry are still taking shape, which means most investors are still quite early, and a growing group of NBA players are among them.  Many NBA players who start charitable organizations within their first few years of turning pro are gearing up to utilize their platforms to prolong their high-earning years and feed into community enrichment initiatives. Take Terance Mann, the Los Angeles Clippers fourth-year swingman, who has partnered with Chibi Dinos, a sold-out 10,000 non-fungible token (NFT) collection turned Web3 gaming company. He's leveraging his emerging platform in an established NBA market to push into an emerging Web3 gaming market to build his brand and benefit the communities he cares for, as expressed in a recent Boardroom interview alongside his business partner Julian Aiken, founder and CEO W3 Sports.  Read More: How the Golden State Warriors Gamified Fandom With NFTs  LeBron James has also entered the Web3 fray via a Crypto.com partnership with his charitable organization. “Blockchain technology is revolutionizing our economy, sports and entertainment, the art world, and how we engage with one another,"" James said in a statement. ""I want to ensure that communities like the one I come from are not left behind."" James’ “I Promise” school will expose students to this emerging market, teaching them the fundamentals of blockchain technology as part of a long-term strategy for evening the odds in the lives of these disadvantaged youth.  While our own project, Rumble Kong League, is early, we’re also looking at other established players who have begun pushing into the space as waymakers that indicate a sustainable future worth investing in. Take DraftKings, for example, which openly believes “sports will be a main driver for blockchain adoption, and digital collectibles are an important part of that process.” Another great example is how Nike activated in the Roblox metaverse with the help of James as a brand validator.  Clearly, Web3 technology is valuable for brands, athletes and the communities they care for. The Kevin Durant Charity Foundation (KDCF), part of Durant’s Thirty Five Ventures, is also the parent company of Boardroom TV, an outlet that shares in-depth stories from the athlete’s perspective at the intersections of sport, business and culture. The KDCF partnered with Coinbase this past May to give 50 minority students eager to learn about the growing blockchain and Web3 industries an opportunity to do so at ”Crypto University.” Ventures like these feed back into the several community empowerment activities that Durant manages through KDCF, and these initiatives are as much about financial empowerment as they are about recognition.  Forty years ago, music industry kingmaker Jimmy Iovine correctly identified black culture as a rich source of commerce-driving-influence. Iovine invested his time and money into unearthing and anointing many black, brown and or underresourced musical artists through Interscope records. A top list of them includes the late Tupac Shakur, Dr. Dre, Mary J. Blige, The Black Eyed Peas, 50 Cent and Eminem, to name a few. While Iovine’s work is widely appreciated and revered, the Web3 economy can utilize blockchain, the ultimate open application programming interface (API), to enable athletes and artists to earn directly from their NFT collections and other contributions, eliminating the need for middlemen and the like.  Read More: NBA Top Shot 101  Through the power of blockchain technology, NFT music is being touted as the breakthrough application to bridge the gap between early adoption and mainstream uptake due to music’s transcendent popularity. Art is also one area where long-standing institutions see value and opportunity for buyers and creators in NFT and Web3 art. The creator economy is primed for a shot in the arm, financially speaking. The age-old issue of the starving artist never seeing the financial windfall of their work can be corrected quickly. Through smart contracts, artists can set sell-on clauses to automatically kick back a cut of any future transaction made. Imagine I sell a PFP NFT of my Kong for .05 ETH, or $69.60 (which I would never do). Say Sotheby's buys it off me and sells it for 800 ETH ($1.1 million) in a bull market next year. If I have a 15% kickback clause in my contract I'll receive instant notification that I've just received $167,037 with no negotiation or fuss.  Black culture is inarguably popular and drives commerce, making many corporations billions in revenue yearly while somehow leaving the source of brand identity inspiration out of the loop. Web3 technology is creating an avenue to close that gap through the empowerment of visible black culture leaders as bridges between underserved communities, underpaid industries and this emerging tech market. This vision, though specific, doesn't just benefit black and brown communities, it benefits everyone touched by these industries, including artists; collectors; K-12 students in the cities of Akron, Ohio; Lowell, Massachusetts; the borough of Brooklyn, New York; and many more urban neighborhoods where underserved black and brown people live. We feel we’re all on the same team, and we’re ready to empower NBA athletes and our own community through the metaverse basketball league we’re building at Rumble Kong League. Let’s see if we’re right in 10 years time.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Marcus Bläsche,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/07/28/why-nba-athletes-are-turning-to-web3-to-build-generational-wealth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d5aee834bed60f2348b3664b399bf56eb8723c9d-4250x3188.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411441,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNlTx,1659045599,How Is Being in Crypto Like Playing a Sport?,"Editor's note: As part of CoinDesk’s “Sports Week,” we asked a number of engineers, executives and experts to weigh in on the substantial issues raised by the crypto industry. In this roundtable discussion, they answer the question of how crypto is like a sport.  Crypto, like fencing  I was a nationally ranked epéeist, recruited by the best NCAA Division I Fencing programs. This achievement followed 12 years of hard work, often seemingly divorced from the thrill of a well-executed attack. But to play a dangerous, physical game of chess against an armed opponent and win required instincts, forbearance, stamina and agility.  This meant preparation.  My footwork needed to be swift and sure. My fingers needed dexterity to direct the point of a blade with a flick. I cultivated instincts: How long or short to lunge; which parry to use for different attacks; when and how to riposte (to righties and lefties) and when to trust intuition. Coaches taught me self-possession and patience. I learned to read opponents and develop strategies to win fast five-point bouts and more grueling 15 point bouts. Conditions and opponents were unknown. The skills needed to succeed in fencing are the same as in the ever-transforming crypto landscape.  Crypto requires swift and sure software development, dextrous cryptography, strategic game theory, advanced mathematics, intuitive automation, elegant economics and instincts for navigating the unknown. The industry evolves before internal and external conditions are fully understood. What started with [bitcoin] grew into [initial coin offerings], [decentralized finance] and [non-fungible tokens]. New markets, services, regulatory bodies, professions, skills, products and infrastructure have emerged. What made a successful ecosystem in [proof-of-work] will shift with the Merge. Who will survive? Who will win? Crypto is not for the cautious nor, despite what some would have you believe, for instant gratification.  – Portia Roberts, growth marketing at Blocknative  Stack sats  “You miss 100% of the sats you don’t stack.”  – Will Reeves, CEO of Fold  Personalities and teams  Like the world of sports, notable personalities dominate in crypto. People root for specific players and teams to win or lose, depending on their affiliation. I see the Web3 sector as one big sports league. And every team just fumbled.  Just as we see when sports teams have a considerable loss, there's been a recommitment to winning in the crypto space. We’re building back and coming out stronger than before by making better plays and getting more fans on our side.  – Chris Laurent, co-founder of VHS Lab and Human Park  Meritocratic field  Crypto is the truest free-for-all competition – that is, the truest free market – the world has yet seen. In crypto, projects develop protocols that compete for usership and capital. But unlike in the arena of professional sports, competition in crypto operates on a completely level playing field, where every user must be not only earned, but retained. In sports, players are largely owned by the teams that they represent in competition; whereas in crypto, community members act as collective owners of the networks and protocols in which they participate.  See also: Crypto Is Coming to Esports: The Games and Economics of Tomorrow  Crypto has raised a radical and innovative paradigm to the mainstream: an empirically meritocratic environment for competition.  – Alex Shipp, CSO of Offshift  How the money game is played  Crypto requires the mental fortitude of an athlete by being disciplined and focused in your strategies and conviction. Blockchain is an emerging technology that isn’t just a fun widget you can buy, it’s shaking up the foundation of how the money game is played. Being in the crypto space is like being an elite athlete, you have to see the trends, study the tape and take chances when necessary in order to win.""  – Ben Armstrong, founder of BitBoy Crypto  The crypto generation  Both sports and crypto require a high level of determination. In the eyes of the status quo, you’re betting against the odds if you take up either of these paths, making your inner conviction all the more important to your success.  Like in boxing, crypto makes you roll with the punches sometimes. Your first couple of down markets as an investor can certainly feel like heavy blows. Whether you’re trading punches in the boxing ring or trading crypto, it’s your skillset, finesse and persistence that will carry you through to a win.  In both crypto and sports, there is always an element of being in the right place at the right time. The advancements in crypto happening now are unlocking countless possibilities for people around the world – financially, creatively and organizationally. When football was first broadcast on TV, think about how many kids that inspired to take to the field. We’re now seeing a similar phenomenon emerge with a crypto-native generation.  – Simon Jones, CEO of Voltz Labs  Last pick  I don’t know if you’ve ever been picked last for [a team in] gym class, but I have. I was reminded of the feeling the first time I purchased crypto at its all-time high. It’s a regrettable situation, but at least I got in the game. This is crypto, regardless of how often we fluctuate or dip, we’ll reorganize and learn. We continue to do this due to the love of the “game.” At the end of the day, regardless of which team emerges victorious, the league will still continue to grow. And what’s clearly apparent is that we’re barely halfway into the first quarter.  – Simon Yu, CEO of StormX  Best of the best  When playing a sport you must always try and predict the next move of the other players. You have to stay vigilant to anticipate what’s coming and be able to react quickly. It’s vitally important for you to understand the game on a micro and macro level, and to build a talented, dedicated team to ensure you’re playing at your best. You have to keep your head in the game no matter what the conditions, and always rally when things look grim. Playing with the best of the best pushes you to do better, and in our industry, we’re constantly inspired by our peers.  See also: 10 Crypto Sports All-Stars  This is crypto in a nutshell – a challenging, dynamic sport, full of healthy competition and collaboration that keeps us striving to perform at the next level. We just need to keep our eye on the ball, pace ourselves accordingly (it's a marathon, not a sprint!), and let our love of the game lead us.  – JP Bedoya, chief product officer of Civic  High-order thinking  Similar to sports, crypto requires a person to be aware of their environment, motivated enough to endure setbacks and to think both granularly and at a high level. Even with all of the rapid growth and increased adoption being seen in the industry recently, crypto at large is still in its formative stages. In such a stage, those involved must be able to look around and determine true signals from noise. As an industry that is not exempt to volatility, someone in crypto should be able to appreciate wins and losses alike. With all of the daily activity surrounding popular tokens, exchanges and memes, it pays to be able to focus on the fine details as well as the overarching trends.  – Ryan Berkun, CEO of Teller",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/07/28/how-is-being-in-crypto-like-playing-a-sport,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba05dc23cd5601bd81779159f3cc0bdf0c988027-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374123,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXwvJ,1659044654,Crypto Lender Voyager Ordered by US Regulators to Stop Misleading Customers,"Crypto lender Voyager Digital has been ordered by U.S. banking regulators to stop making incorrect claims that the company was insured by the government.  The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ordered Voyager to cease any representations that its customers' funds would be protected in case of the company's failure, according to a statement published Thursday.  ""Voyager has made various representations online, including its website, mobile app, and social media accounts, stating or suggesting that: (1) Voyager itself is FDIC-insured; (2) customers who invested with the Voyager cryptocurrency platform would receive FDIC insurance coverage for all funds provided to, held by, on, or with Voyager; and (3) the FDIC would insure customers against the failure of Voyager itself,"" the letter said. ""These representations are false and misleading and, based on the information we have to date, it appears that the representations likely misled and were relied upon by customers who placed their funds with Voyager and do not have immediate access to their funds.""  “It appears that these representations likely misled and were relied upon by customers who placed their funds with Voyager and do not have immediate access to their funds,” the agencies said in their joint press release. The Toronto-based crypto lender collapsed earlier this month, filing for bankruptcy protection.  The regulators ""demanded"" that Voyager ""immediately remove"" any statements or references suggesting the company is FDIC-insured and send a letter to the Fed and FDIC confirming not only the removal of said references, but also what steps Voyager took to do so.  ""If you believe that any statement you have made related to FDIC deposit insurance is true and accurate, please provide: (1) such written confirmation within two (2) business days from the receipt of this letter, and (2) a full listing of all such statements regarding deposit insurance on any medium or platform, together with information and documentation supporting the accuracy of all such statements, not later than ten (10) days from the date of this correspondence,"" the letter said.  The Fed and FDIC warned that they may still take further action if needed, without suggesting what that might look like.  The FDIC previously confirmed it was looking into claims that Voyager's customers' funds were FDIC-insured in the event the lender collapsed. In reality, only Voyager's own omnibus account at its New York bank was covered.  The government letter, sent to CEO Stephen Ehrlich, comes too late to protect the money customers entrusted to Voyager. At this stage, they're watching the bankruptcy courts and any further intervention from other firms, such as FTX.  Sam Bankman-Fried's trading platform made an early liquidity offer to Voyager customers, though lawyers for Voyager criticized it as a ""low-ball bid dressed up as a white knight rescue"" that only benefits FTX.  Bankruptcy court Judge Michael Wiles has already been hearing from customers such as Lisa Dagnoli of Massachusetts, who asked the presiding judge in a letter to ""please hear the truth about their marketing, their spending, their fiscal activities, and the amount of money they have from people all over that are crushed financially because we trusted Voyager.""

42374144,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXxHx,1659042388,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Pushes Higher Despite Negative GDP Report,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price continued its ascent in Thursday trading, rising 4% despite a negative U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) report.  The quarterly growth rate declined 0.9% relative to estimates for a 0.5% increase. The decrease marks the second consecutive quarter for negative GDP growth, which historically has signaled an economic recession.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Officially the National Bureau of Economic Research determines when the U.S. has entered recession, dependent on a range of factors.  Following the Thursday report, yields of U.S. Treasury notes declined, with the yield on 10-year notes surpassing yields on two-year notes. Bond yields have an inverse relationship with prices, meaning when one rises the other falls. When Treasury bond yields fall, it implies the notes are being purchased. Investors often purchase the safer Treasury bonds (rather than stocks or crypto) when they doubt the strength of the overall economy.  In traditional equity markets, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively.  Ether’s (ETH) price increased as well on Thursday, rising by another 9% following Wednesday’s 16% jump.  Altcoins were in positive territory, too, with Cosmos’ ATOM token jumping by 8% while Polkadot’s DOT rose by 9%.     Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $23,900 +4.4%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,742 +7.8%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,072.43 +1.2%      ●Gold: $1,774 per troy ounce +3.2%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.68% −0.05       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Does Potential Trouble for the US Economy Signal Higher Asset Prices?  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Bitcoin continued to move higher on Thursday, pushing past $23,000, despite a GDP report that showed second-quarter decline rather than growth. The negative 0.9% reading follows last quarter’s 1.6% decline and missed projections for a 0.5% increase in growth. Still, asset classes across the board responded favorably, with prices in both traditional finance and cryptocurrencies moving higher as investors saw evidence the economy is slowing at a slower, more desirable rate instead of plunging into recession.  Bond markets were more skeptical, with the yields for the two-year Treasury note surpassing yields for the 10-year Treasury note, resulting in an inverted yield curve. An inverted yield curve is an interest rate environment in which long-term debt instruments have a lower yield than short-term debt instruments of the same credit quality. The purchase of Treasury notes is essentially a loan to the U.S. government with the expectation the loan will be paid back with interest (i.e., the yield rate).  When the yield for a two-year loan is higher than the yield for a 10-year loan, bond markets require a higher rate of interest for a short-term loan than they would for a longer-term loan.  Historically in the U.S., such scenarios have been a precursor to recession. The below image shows the spread between yields on the 10-year and two-year Treasury notes, and how the spread has been in decline since March of 2021. Shaded regions indicate areas of recession, which have historically occurred 12-18 months following inversion.     The higher asset prices in the aftermath of negative economic data suggest that markets expect the Federal Reserve to take a milder approach to reducing inflation, and may put policies in effect that are favorable to asset prices.  Meanwhile, a Commitment of Traders (COT) report is showing signs that speculators are adding to long bitcoin positions. The report provides a weekly snapshot of positions held by traders in futures markets and is published by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The positions of small speculators are denoted in blue (see below), while the positions of “large speculators” (i.e., asset managers) are denoted in green. Beginning around July 11, the COT report shows that small speculators are net long BTC because they’ve breached the center line (0.0), thereby moving into positive territory.  In the past, small and large speculators have often been opposite each other (i.e., October 2021), with institutions likely to be short BTC when retail investors are long.  Options markets have been giving bullish BTC signs as well, for the moment. When looking at BTC by strike price there is a large concentration of call option volume, and open interest at the $25,000 price level. For context, a call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy BTC at a specific price level (the strike price). The existence of significant volume at a strike price above the current price can be viewed as an indication of bullish sentiment.

42421138,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZWKD,1659041728,"Apple Is Stifling the Metaverse, Tech Expert Says","Apple may be stifling development of the metaverse, according to Matthew Ball, managing partner of the venture capital firm Epyllion Co. and author of “The Metaverse and How It Will Revolutionize Everything.”  While Apple appears to be in a position to “thrive in the next era” of more immersive computing, its control over distribution may be crimping the industry, Ball said.  “Apple does not allow for crypto-based virtual worlds,” Ball said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” show on Thursday. “They're successfully stymieing a specific type of disruptive innovation and category.”  By steering clear of complex virtual worlds, the tech giant is exerting undue influence over “what is available and what isn’t,” Ball said.  The metaverse is an emerging category of computing, which some see as the next frontier of the internet. According to a Pew Research Center study, over 50% of tech innovators and developers predict the metaverse will be further integrated into people’s daily lives by 2040.  Ball said that the iPhone maker sells more smartphones in the U.S. than it does globally and earns a significant portion of its profits from controlling software on its platforms through its control over APIs, or application programming interfaces, which serve as a bridge between two apps. Applications on Apple’s iOS interface require Apple’s approval and must pay a fee to Apple.  The metaverse is not the only sector Apple has seemingly crowded out of its influential app marketplace. It has taken a conservative stance toward crypto and porn, for instance, Ball said.  “If you consider most of the crypto games today, they’re either not available on the iOS app, or they are, but they’re relatively rudimentary,” Ball said. He noted, however, that some of those programs not allowed through the App Store are still available as a “browser experience.”  Apple is in a unique position to shape the future of entire industries, Ball said. And its choices aren’t always entirely consistent. Axie Infinity, Sandbox 3D and CryptoKitties are among the estimated 30 crypto-based games in its app store.  That could in part be due to a “clampdown on business models [and] cloud gaming,” Ball said. “We see them taxing user-generated contributions.”  Apple charges a 30% fee on sales generated on its App Store.  Read more: What Epic vs. Apple Means for Crypto  Next frontier  Ball said Apple users should have more freedom over how they use their devices, citing the identification systems used on iOS devices, which are limited to proprietary options like Apple ID.  Apple limits what users can do and access in favor of curated experiences and with iPhone’s huge market share, that is likely stifling innovation, Ball said.  “No one can capture your identity, your social graph, your data, your virtual assets, and then use that to preclude competition,” he said.  Few now know what the metaverse is, and no one can say what it will develop into. In fact, Ball doesn’t think that term will even be used years from now.  “You'll find in the years to come that we're often inside a 3D simulation” perhaps without even knowing it, Ball said.” That is, if Apple doesn’t stifle the metaverse today, he said.

42411749,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfgOe,1659040031,Are Dapps the Future of the Creator Economy?,"These days, it seems everything is fair game for monetizable content.  The creator economy is, simply put, the era of decentralized media. Similar to traditional media corporations, individual creators can now earn money through a wide variety of methods — including affiliate links, sponsorships, ad revenue, digital sales and more. That means all the cat videos, hair tutorials and TikTok recipes we share with friends and family could be someone’s meal ticket.  Many creators are earning consistently enough from content to leave their full-time jobs. But the current model forces creators to give control – and a huge percentage of their revenue – to platforms like YouTube and Spotify that host their content and build their audiences. Now, thanks to crypto, artists and creators in this new creator economy, we can explore new tools that can help them maintain ownership of their content and intellectual property, or even share ownership with their fans if they want to.  The applications making this new reality possible are called dapps – short for decentralized applications. Let’s have a look at what dapps are and how creators are using them.  What is a dapp?  Dapps are blockchain-based applications that run code for a specific function or use case. They are just like any app on your smartphone or desktop, with a front-end interface allowing users to easily perform functions like clicking, scrolling, typing into text fields and submitting data or content to be used for a particular purpose. From a user perspective, dapps are the same as a normal application like Instagram except for one key difference: They utilize blockchain technology on the back end to record data linked to users’ crypto wallets.  There are dapps for all uses, including financial purposes — such as DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols that let users swap one currency for another — and creative ones, such as marketplaces for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Dapps utilize smart contracts to plan, execute and settle transactions automatically. This somewhat eliminates the need for a centralized corporation like Meta to act as the mediator, though companies that build dapps still put forth user agreements and policies.  Why do creators need dapps?  Hopeful Web3 developers and creators argue we have an opportunity to use dapp technology wisely and learn from some of the mistakes we made with Web2 platforms, such as data breaches and centralized profit-sharing models that siphon revenue and royalties away from the creators themselves.  If Web3 works the way early adopters want it to, dapps will unlock higher earning potential and greater transparency for artists and creators who traditionally get the short end of the revenue stick on traditional platforms.  Take Spotify, for instance. Regarding artist payouts, it's one of the most forthcoming of the Web2 streaming platforms. Spotify publishes its earnings data for the artists who contribute every year. Just 1,040 artists broke $1 million in streaming proceeds on Spotify last year, and only 16,500 artists made more than $50,000 – barely a middle-class salary in the U.S. The success stories represent a fraction of the 8 million contributing artists on Spotify (though only 2.6 million contributed more than 10 songs).  The frustrations we saw in Web2’s paradigm are not entirely Spotify’s fault: Traditional publishing and/or streaming platforms of any kind must answer to big-time stakeholders in their respective industries. This is how traditional revenue models have always worked. Spotify paid out more than $1 billion to holders of music publishing rights last year, and the record industry made $4 billion from streaming alone, according to the service provider.  So, how could dapps change things for artists? Let’s have a look.  How will dapps help creators?  The creator economy is now 50 million people strong and could provide an “incredibly welcome change” from the traditional day-job model, said Calaxy co-founder Solo Ceesay in a recent Rolling Stone article.  According to a tweet from leading crypto venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Web3 platforms paid out $174,000 per creator in 2021. In comparison, Meta paid out 10 cents per user, and YouTube paid out $2.47 per channel, amounting to a $15 billion total.  There are, of course, fewer users currently creating on decentralized platforms than on traditional Web2 platforms. But according to a ConsenSys representative, MetaMask, the leading Ethereum self-custody wallet, now has 30 million active monthly users, many of whom opened their wallets during the NFT hype of 2021. Now that so many supporters, fans, collectors and investors have onboarded to crypto and Web3, those in the industry see a reason to keep building and refining products with creator empowerment in mind.  “We saw a very specific bubble form around the PFP [profile picture] NFTs,” says MetaMask global product lead Taylor Monahan. “But I think the old-school desire to empower people is still there.”  According to Monahan, a prominent conversation among the MetaMask team is about how to serve musicians, artists and creators. “How do we give creatives the ability to disintermediate all the people who currently stand in their way, preventing them from accessing the value that ultimately they're creating?” she asks.  However, until today’s emerging dapps are as widely tested and commonplace as Facebook, pioneering Web3 creators will likely experience some trial and error as developers experiment and innovate.  Examples of dapps  Dapp development is a burgeoning industry, and demand is only going up.  Creators need tools that help them “very simply leverage Web3 technology to be able to showcase their artwork,” says Nayana Singh, global product lead for Infura, an Ethereum software company.  In the meantime, there are some trends and forecasts to keep an eye on:  NFT marketplaces  NFT marketplaces are perhaps the most important type of dapp that creators should know about, says music industry executive, former YouTube curator and P00LS community lead Melanie McClain.  For instance, a creator can upload a video to the Ethereum-based NFT marketplace Rarible and code smart contracts to distribute a certain percentage of royalties from all secondary marketplace sales into wallets chosen by the creator. If you have a team of collaborators, such as graphic designers, producers, editors, etc., you can add their wallets to the smart contract and share the royalties from future sales.  Read more: Minting Your First NFT  OpenSea is the most popular NFT marketplace, but McClain argues that creators should consider making their own. It’s totally possible (and worth the investment, argues McClain) to assemble a development team and build a marketplace with website-like functionality.  “Everything goes back to the idea of having a place where you can tell your story,” McClain says. “OpenSea is great,” she says, but its popularity has attracted some collectors more interested in the floor price than the artist.  Making your own NFT marketplace is not a requirement, but it’s a lot more accessible than you’d think thanks to resources like GitHub, an open-source code library, and Zora, an NFT marketplace protocol that offers developer toolkits for people who don’t know coding language. This won’t be quite as simple (not yet, anyway) as building a Squarespace website, but McClain forecasts that proprietary marketplaces will be standard for creators going forward.  This approach lets you control the narrative and mint on the blockchain and/or metaverse worlds you like best. It also lets you become better acquainted with the users who come to your site, McClain says: “It’s literally like having daily active users in the same way that we look at a social media platform. Marketplaces are the first step in making that happen.”  Case in point: LimeWire is back – just not in the way we think of it. The old-school peer-to-peer music-sharing network’s return from the dead is well-timed for Web3 because it resurrected itself in the form of a music-based NFT platform.  Streaming platforms  Audius is perhaps the most talked-about Web3 music-streaming platform. It runs on social tokens, specifically audio token rewards. Users earn tokens for uploading music, listening to other artists’ songs and sharing their favorites with friends and the broader community. The audio token is also a governance token, meaning audio holders have a say in certain changes to Audius and can vote on proposals that are submitted on the blockchain.  Audius has more than 5 million active users, according to its website. Users can stake their tokens to secure the network, thereby earning DeFi rewards of 7%.  See also: What Are Music NFTs?  Social platforms  Similar to streaming platforms, creator-centric social platforms let fans earn tokens for engaging with and sharing content. For example, P00LS releases regular music drops and lets artists release their own token so that fans can hold it in their wallets.  This distinction between earning tokens and buying them matters, says McClain: “When it comes to our marketplace, people earn tokens. They don't buy tokens with ETH. They don't buy with a credit card.”  Fans earn through engagement with the P00LS marketplace and their favorite creators’ content. There are options to read about the artist and take quizzes to get rewarded.  “People know these things that they care about and they want to learn more about, then get rewarded for it – I think there needs to be way more of that,” says McClain.  Social platforms that reward fans are particularly advantageous for loyal followers, curators and trendsetters. Thought leaders and tastemakers who forecast up-and-coming artists on TikTok, for example, rarely (if ever) see monetary rewards when their predictions come true. In Web3, McClain says, people should be rewarded for being a fan from the early days of an artist's career or for influencing industry-level decision makers about what’s hot. Having great taste should make someone a known subject matter expert in Web3 and open up better processes for compensating those who influence top industry decision makers.  “What are ways, in Web3, that we cannot leave them behind and not just give them brownie points, but really give them tokens, give them equity, give them something that can really have value?” asks McClain.  Bottom line  Support for dapps and a fully decentralized creator economy is steadily growing, especially in light of Meta announcing sky-high creator fees, up to 47%. Creators want a way to prevent excessive fees, determine their own royalty structures and maintain agency over their intellectual property and fan base.  For new artists, acquiring a Web3 skill set may feel like a lot of pressure, but developers and industry experts predict the creator economy will ultimately make things better – and more fun – for artists and fans alike.

42422628,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0nqXh,1659039491,"Janet Yellen Sees No Recession, Calls US Economy ‘Exceptionally Strong’","The U.S. economy is not in a recession because it has not met the complex criteria that would define such an economic downturn, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Thursday during a press conference. She spoke following the release of gross domestic product (GDP) data showing declining growth for a second consecutive quarter.  Yellen’s interpretation differs from those who define a recession as occurring when GDP shrinks for two straight quarters. However, there are some economic observers who have said the factors behind a recession are more complex than previously thought.  U.S. GDP fell by an unexpectedly high 0.9% for the second quarter after dropping over a percentage point for the previous three months.  Yellen said the real definition of a recession is a “broad-based weakening of the economy,” and “that is not what we’re seeing right now.”  She also said a “semantic battle” about whether the country is in a recession should be “avoided.”  “What we can constructively do is talk about what is the state of the economy,” she said, highlighting that the labor market remains “exceptionally strong.”  Inflation remains the Biden Administration’s main priority, and there’s a possibility the Federal Reserve can tame inflation without causing the labor market to suffer, Yellen said, reiterating a previous talking point.  “There’s a path to bring down inflation while maintaining a strong labor market,” Yellen said. “It’s not a certainty that that can be done, but I believe there is a path to accomplishing that.”  Inflation is still running at a four-decade high of 9.1%, causing American households to think twice, be it about everyday things like groceries or investing in risky assets such as cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) has plunged about 50% in value since the start of the year, and ether (ETH) and other major alternative coins have suffered steep declines as well.  But U.S. employers added 372,000 jobs in June, suggesting there is still enough capital in the economy for expanding businesses. Yellen said that in past periods of recession, the labor market lost a significant number of jobs, which currently is not the case.  To be sure, she said, the economy is seeing “significant slowdown in growth” but there are “great strengths,” too.  In the end, Yellen said, the ""official arbiter of what is a recession is going to be the [nonpartisan] National Bureau of Economic Research. They'll decide it some time in the future.""",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/28/janet-yellen-sees-no-recession-calls-us-economy-exceptionally-strong,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99d74f57ab8679cd068b869f4595da2b9c9c91fb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411433,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNl0C,1659038782,Is Solana Leading Crypto Into Retail or Trailing Apple?,"The Solana blockchain is opening an embassy in New York City. Not like a United Nations embassy with ambassadors and diplomats and flags, but a storefront that seemingly doesn’t plan to sell much of anything.  Solana Spaces, located in the high-end Hudson Yards real estate development on Manhattan’s West Side, is a “culture center.” It’s a place where the Solana Foundation imagines people will go to hang out and get educated about crypto.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “Inside, you’ll learn how Solana works, what Web3 is. We’ll set you up with a wallet and your first [non-fungible tokens] and guide you through your first on-chain transactions,” reads a promo from the Solana Spaces Twitter account.  The Space is clearly modeled on the sleek, modern design of Apple Stores – those sales-cum-tech centers that radically transformed Apple (AAPL) into a retail powerhouse when they opened in 2001.  There’s incredibly bright track lighting, white walls, white benches, a white ceiling. Every angle is clean and every curve soft.  Steve Jobs once said the minimalism of Apple Stores was meant to demonstrate his singular focus on design. He wanted his products to look good and be intuitive to use. It’s not a stretch of the imagination to say Solana is taking cues from that tech legend.  See also: Is Sam Bankman-Fried a Modern-Day Robber Baron? | Opinion  Last month, there was news of a “Solana Phone.” Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana and a former Qualcomm engineer, said the network’s smartphone (officially called Solana Saga) was a way to bring crypto into the world of mobile computing. And maybe, just as the iPhone rapidly expanded internet use, a SOL Phone could bring people into crypto.  The SOL Phone would essentially function as a hardware crypto wallet. It would also have a developer’s stack that would make it easier to build, deploy and download crypto apps. This is essential, considering the roadblocks Apple has put in place for blockchain projects to access its App Store.  “All the stuff that is magical about crypto … all depends on self custody,” Yakovenko said in an interview on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program. But there’s a major catch. The “user experience around self custody is horrible,” he said. He’s right.  Solana is staking out interesting ground in attempting to be a retail-friendly tech stack. It’s following a route that worked for at least one conglomerate, but at which countless others have tried and failed.  It’d be easy to criticize the Solana Foundation for striking out in flailing directions, while its core product – the actual crypto network – routinely suffers outages. But if they have money to burn (considering Manhattan rents), both a phone and an ""embassy” are worth betting on.  Solana, invented as an Ethereum killer, is still trailing that blockchain by most metrics. It has fewer node operators, fewer holders, a smaller market cap. And so if it hasn’t differentiated itself on software (at a time when Ethereum is rebuilding itself to be more user friendly) maybe it can with hardware and a physical footprint.  Some Ethereum stans said the Solana Space was a sign of the network’s centralization. Like other blockchains launched after Bitcoin, Solana took venture capital funding and started a non-profit entity that largely directs the chain’s development.  These efforts actually seem in line with the “brand” that Solana’s founders are attempting to sell. Solana distinguished itself on the idea of scalability and affordability. For a while, they rejected the term “blockchain” in part because of the clunky and expensive associations that term carried.  Although there’s a difference between the entity building Solana and the network itself, I’m curious what Gary Gensler, top cop at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, would say about the “expected profit” from the “common effort” of building and marketing phones and a retail footprint.  It’s also worth wondering what the long-term plan is, and what it would mean for the crypto industry if other network’s got into the retail game. Would the Algorand people hang its shingle across the mall like Microsoft (MSFT) trailing Apple?  Not to be pessimistic, but it’s hard to see how the world would be meaningfully different if, say, every other person carried a SOL Phone in their pocket.  See also: An Ape Ain't Free: In Defense of Ethereum's Fees | Opinion  In interviews, Yakovenko often brought up the idea of how the SOL Phone, with Solana Pay built in, would make it easier to “buy a cup of coffee” with crypto. Are we actually heading towards a world where everyone uses one or dozens or hundreds of private, algorithmic currencies? Maybe if the U.S. dollar actually implodes.  Payments were bitcoin’s first failed use case. Beyond the tech that made transactions slow and expensive, few people wanted to pay capital gains as well as sales tax. There have been improvements to the tech and the law can change. Maybe micropayments will catch on. People today do use Lightning and Phantom, and perhaps it’d be nice to have the option – but Apple Pay works fine.  Yakovenko, like many of his peers, discusses crypto as a platform for open innovation. The Solana Phone is an advancement because it would be ungated. This is the founding story of the crypto industry, and too nebulous a claim to defend or debunk.  But you could take a look at the type of innovation happening on Solana by peaking into the store, (officially not open). There's merch with NFT characters and meme slogans. A limited run of Blanksoles sneakers. And also an interactive art exhibit, and tutorials for some of its most popular apps.  Apple’s story in the history of computing followed the trend towards smaller and more powerful computers. Its success in the 1980s was betting on the legitimacy of personal computing – at a time when building-sized mainframes were fresh memories. Then came the iPhone.

42422629,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0nqZh,1659037077,Ex-CFTC Chairman Sees Europe’s MiCA Bill as Threat to US Crypto Industry,"NEW YORK – Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chief Chris Giancarlo is worried that the European Union's fast-moving Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill could lead to the global export of European-style crypto regulation, hurting U.S. regulators’ ability to effectively create rules of their own.  The landmark legal framework, which hasn't been made law yet, aims to provide regulatory clarity to the growing crypto industry in Europe.  “I’m very concerned with the rapidity of MiCA’s evolution,” Giancarlo said at Solidus Labs’ annual DACOM summit in New York on Thursday. “It’s got some very expansive provisions that would, in a sense, export its approach to crypto assets to the United States.”  As the U.S. struggles to provide regulatory clarity to the domestic crypto industry, global regulatory frameworks like MiCA could fill the gap. CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham, who recently relaunched the CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory Committee, told attendees on Thursday that market structures, once set, are extremely difficult to change.  “Once those market structures change and shift and harden and all that enormous money and investment of capital comes into those new market structures, it’s very hard to change it back,” Pham said.  Several crypto bills have been introduced in Congress, but efforts to establish a regulatory framework have been slow.  “Congress does need to continue its momentum,” Giancarlo said. “We need to get our own framework out there, and our framework needs to make clear that for U.S. activities there will be U.S. regulation, not regulation coming out of Europe. I have great respect for Europe, but their markets are very different.”  Pham said, “It’s so important that we are rule makers, not rule takers.""

The 24-hour trading volume of Ravencoin is $71.55 Million, indicating a hike of 522%.

42422620,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0nqJh,1659031250,Dick Durbin Joins US Senators Criticizing Fidelity’s Plan to Include Bitcoin in 401(k) Plans,"U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) has joined the Labor Department and fellow senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Tina Smith (D-Minn.) in flagging concerns over Fidelity Investment's plan to offer bitcoin (BTC) as an investment option for its 401(k) managed accounts.  The letter, addressed to Fidelity Investments CEO Abigail Johnson, criticizes the firm’s decision to offer workers the option to invest in an “untested, highly volatile asset like bitcoin.”  In April the U.S.-based financial services firm announced it would allow investors to put bitcoin (BTC) into 401(k) retirement plans later this year, capping bitcoin holdings at 20% of an account’s value.  In May, Warren cosigned a similar letter with Smith asking Fidelity about the “appropriateness” of its plans.  Both letters echo concerns raised by the Labor Department about the appropriateness of the token as a store of value. “We have grave concerns with what Fidelity has done,” Ali Khawar, acting assistant secretary of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, told the Wall Street Journal in April.  When reached for comment, a company spokesperson said Fidelity is ""proud of the Digital Assets Account as a responsible solution to meet the demands of mainstream interest"" and is on track to launch its first plans this fall. The spokesperson added that Fidelity is continuing to work directly with policymakers to answer their questions.  Fidelity’s retirement accounts constitute a significant share of the retirement fund market. In 2020, the firm’s accounts held an estimated $2.4 trillion in 401(k) assets, or more than a third of the market at the time, according to research firm Cerulli Associates.  The letter comes at a time when Congress is paying more attention to cryptocurrencies than ever before. On July 27, the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee held three separate hearings on various aspects of the crypto industry.  Durbin previously implored U.S. regulators to “learn the truth” about the crypto industry as he criticized crypto-mining initiatives in a mid-July tweet. “Families and businesses in America will pay the price for crypto’s mining ventures,” he wrote.

The back-to-back negative readings are commonly referenced as a &apos;technical recession.&apos; While recessions are not a desirable outcome, bad news is good news in this case as speculators&apos; expectations of future interest-rate increases ease given looming recession fears. Nevertheless, Powell emphasized during his press conference Wednesday that &apos;I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession,&apos; as the economy is still adding jobs. Specifically, markets are pricing in 74.0% chance that the Fed will lift its target rate by 50 basis points at its Sept. 20-21 meeting, according to CME&apos;s FedWatch tool. That would be a slower move than the Fed&apos;s most recent hike of 75 bps to bring down inflation.

Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), the ranking Republican on the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, is talking to Democrats to make his stablecoin oversight bill a bipartisan effort. Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) confirmed Thursday he’s been involved in the discussions.  ""The first place where we should be able to find common ground, and I actually think in many cases are close, is to chart a path forward for clear and sensible regulations on stablecoins,"" Toomey said at a Thursday committee hearing, mentioning his own push for oversight of the tokens.  ""I'm in discussion with several members to make this proposal a bipartisan one,"" said Toomey, who called his proposal a “starting point.”  Brown spoke briefly Thursday after Toomey’s mention of the stablecoin proposal.  “Senator Toomey and I have talked about this,” Brown said, noting that the two have “a different view generally” over the intensity of regulation needed for stablecoins. However, he added that “we want to get to that. We want the regulators to go as far as they can go.”  Stablecoins are designed to maintain steady value thanks to being pegged to an assets such as the U.S. dollar. The largest stablecoins – Tether’s USDT and Circle Internet Financial’s USDC, both backed by U.S. dollars – allow investors to reliably trade in and out of more volatile digital assets.  Toomey’s proposal pushes for full disclosure of the reserves that back stablecoins. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would regulate stablecoin issuers.  Bipartisan negotiation in the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee about a similar stablecoin regulation bill has been delayed until after the August congressional recess.  Also at the Thursday hearing, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said she's poised to release a bill ""to regulate the crypto market and stamp out the worst scams.""

The newly announced backers included the venture capital arm of crypto exchange Coinbase, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea, Crypto.com Capital, crypto market-maker Wintermute, decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Gnosis and the Polygon blockchain. The round was led by crypto investment firm Polychain.  Nomad lets applications send data between blockchains and rollups, which are blockchain scalability solutions, with a focus on security. Security issues in cross-chain bridges have led to notable and expensive exploits, including the $625 million attack on Axie Infinity’s Ronin network in March. Nomad utilizes optimistic verification, which gives anyone watching a blockchain a short window to challenge questionable on-chain messages.  Use cases for Nomad include users bridging tokens across chains, asset issuers deploying tokens, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) executing cross-chain governance, and developers building cross-chain applications, according to the protocol’s website.  Nomad is currently live on the Ethereum mainnet and the Moonbeam, Evmos and Avalanche blockchains. The funding round will in part help Nomad expand to additional chains.  “Because Nomad provides a trust-minimized protocol for cross-chain messaging, there are potential applications that go well beyond just token bridging,” said Polygon co-founder Anurag Arjun in the press release. “We look forward to seeing some of those exciting new use cases come to life on-chain.”",POSITIVE,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MATIC | SPONSORED,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/28/cross-chain-bridge-nomad-reveals-crypto-heavyweight-backers-for-224m-funding-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/255edc4f7b2fceee2a279bceb4ca6615c0594a81-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411097,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC8ZY,1659021544,How the Golden State Warriors Gamified Fandom With NFTs,"The history of sports collectibles includes a $10,000 piece of Bazooka gum, a signed urinal and boxing legend Joe Frazier’s jockstrap – all used. So for some fans, shelling out $500 for a digital collectible that might go down the tubes with their team’s record might not be out of the question.  Digital sports collectibles on the blockchain are a relatively new phenomenon, but the impulse behind them is well established. Traditional sports collectibles support an entire industry. At the end of July, 80,000-90,000 people are expected to attend the 42nd annual National Sports Collectors Convention in Atlantic City, N.J., to peruse a sea of sports-curios. NFT (non-fungible token) projects' dreams of that kind of community.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Sports Week.""  NFTs, a way to establish ownership of digital media using a blockchain, served as an important catalyst for crypto adoption in the recent crypto bull market. During the 2021 crypto bull run, sports-themed NFTs drove significant interest with NBA Top Shot leading the way. As with traditional collectibles, buyers included a mix of enthusiasts and pure speculators.  Seeing a growing market, the Golden State Warriors, the championship-winning National Basketball Association team, became the first professional sports team to try its hand at marketing NFTs. The team released its first collection in April 2021 and has been innovating ever since.  “You almost think of it as a Venn diagram, where the circle on the left is Warriors fans and on the right is the NFT community and then they overlap,” Warriors Chief Operating Officer Brandon Schneider said in an interview. “As time goes on, [that overlap] has grown and will continue to grow.”  Located near Silicon Valley, the Golden State Warriors are the tech world’s NBA team. Several characters in the orbit of the team have ties to crypto. Chamath Palihapitiya, who until this month held a minority stake in the team, has publicly advocated for and invested in crypto assets.  Although, in a commercial for crypto exchange FTX, superstar Warriors' guard Stephen Curry flouted his lack of crypto knowledge and a made-for-TV trading account balance of $15,084.93, several of his teammates have been experimenting with digital assets. Longtime Warriors Klay Thompson and Andre Iguadala take a portion of their salary in bitcoin.  The very existence of the Warriors’ first NFT collection was innovative. It was a collection to commemorate the team’s six NBA championships and other moments in franchise history, and marked the first time an NBA team rather than an individual athlete experimented with NFTs.  But other teams quickly followed, and now that iconic collection of static JPEGs of digital championship rings and tickets seem to be standard fare. On the second go-round, the Warriors felt they needed to do something that would separate their collection from the competition.  “I think our fans are not only receptive to new ideas tied to technology, but actually expect it,” Schneider said.  In April, the Warriors released a new collection of NFTs with an innovative twist. The collection programmatically responded to the team’s on-court performance, rewarding holders as the Warriors advanced through the NBA playoffs.  The finance of fandom  Fans and speculators could purchase one of 3,000 NFTs and celebrate the team's wins with wins of their own. The main collection sold pieces for $499.99 each, (higher than the price to buy a ticket to most NBA games). But depending on the rarity of the NFT and the playoff round, holders could win courtside tickets to the finals or other prizes such as merchandise or additional NFTs. All were promised a digital championship ring NFT if the Warriors won the championship.  Perhaps because of a lingering aversion to gambling and its proxies, NBA teams don't typically tie fan rewards to the outcomes of games. Of course, there are small stakes promotions that spice up in-arena action. At Philadelphia 76ers' home games, for example, fans get a free Wendy’s Frosty if an opponent misses consecutive free throws in the second half of a game. Comparatively, the Warriors were dangling free tickets to Game 1 of the NBA Finals to NFT holders, with an average ticket price of $873.  The Warriors NFT gamified fandom, turning a spectator to a speculator invested in the team’s success. While giveaways and other holder benefits are common in the NFT world, the Warriors were the first pro team to tie the benefits explicitly to their success and market that feature as such. But it’s not clear if this model will be the future of NFTs in sports.  See also: How Sports Leagues Can Use Crypto to Engage Fans | Opinion  Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban told CoinDesk over email, “I think it’s one of the worst ideas ever.” In Cuban’s mind, this model could create undesirable speculation and potential losses could lead to disgruntled fans. Not very maverick of this Maverick.  The Warriors' collection didn’t sell out – perhaps due to poor timing or limited interest – but the Warriors did win their fourth championship since 2015 this year. The tokens are now a part of both NFT and NBA history – and perhaps mark the beginning of a new game being played in crypto and sports.  Sports memorabilia and speculation: A long history  Depending on your orientation, sports collectibles and NFTs might be an investment, entertainment, a gamble or a waste of time. But an appetite for sports collectibles is time tested.  Dave Amerman, auction director at Goldin Auctions and longtime collector himself, has seen the sports collectibles market grow over the years. What started out as a cottage industry where people bought and sold playing cards or memorabilia has rapidly become professional.  “It's become a whole lot more than just a love for the passion,” Amerman said. There were people who saw the potential early and invested “tens of thousands of dollars a couple of decades ago” and who have come into “life-changing money,” he said.  Collectors can now open a $5 pack of cards in the hopes of finding a rarity worth $100,000. As the money has grown, the field has attracted an entirely new breed of buyer.  “There's plenty of, we'll call it newer money in the hobby, where there's people that come in purely on spec, big business guys, people that run hedge funds, all sorts of those types of investors,” Amerman said.  Alt, an alternative investment group, recently purchased a stake in a Steph Curry trading card for a then-record $5.9 million valuation  A similar dynamic played out in the crypto bull market during the coronavirus pandemic. NFTs, once a niche market of the already niche digital asset industry, exploded, with sports-related platforms like Top Shot seeing a notable surge in interest.  Both fandom and speculation contribute to the market price for collectibles. Typically, buyers speculate on the existence of a future market for a particular collectible. The Warriors collection of so-called ""responsive"" NFTs mixed that up by an asset's value to material rewards based on the team's performance. You weren't just betting the NFTs could be sold in the distant future, but whether the Warriors would win an upcoming game.  It’s a ploy with sound reasoning. For as big as the sports collectibles market is (estimated $26.1 billion), the market for sports gambling market (estimated $76.5 billion) dwarfs it. And indirect wagering games like fantasy sports remain hugely popular.  Potential drawbacks  It can be a thorny proposition for a multibillion-dollar sports franchise to attach its brand to an NFT project. And not just because you could make any committed fan angry if they lose money.  There are legitimate concerns that some NFTs that generate profits could be deemed securities, no matter how tightly lawyered the mint was. By specifically marketing the series on wins and losses, NFTs responsive to team success might warrant increased scrutiny.  “There are plenty of ways to gamble"" on sports, Cuban said. Sports and NFTs are a natural fit, he said, but it becomes ethically dubious if a team is promoting financial speculation. NFTs can have utility for sports fans: They can be used as mementos, can provide people with backstage access and can record highlight moments from games, for instance.  ""We use the NFTS as a free reward for scanning in to a Mavs game. That’s the behavior we want to reward. Coming to games,” Cuban wrote.  That idea is sometimes referred to as ""proof-of-attendance"" tokens. It's perhaps the digital equivalent of when stadiums hand out commemorative cups or T-shirts as a badge of physical world fandom. Proof-of-attendance tokens are still financial assets that can be traded on secondary marketplaces, but so far, the emphasis has been engaging with teams in a way that’s fan-first, finance-second.  Schneider, the Warriors' COO, discounted the idea of attendance tokens, given the increasingly global nature of sports fandoms. Most people will never be able to mint their proof-of-attendance, even if they are a Warriors die-hard fan.  See also: NBA Top Shot 101  “The reality is 99% of our fans will never go to a game at Chase Center, because they live all around the world,” he said, referring to the Warriors' home arena in San Francisco.  These are the kinds of concerns franchises must consider when diving into NFTs, he said. Although there is a market for autographs, many people are content simply with the sentimental value. Digital collectible can operate in the same way – simply as a meaningful fan experiences. Or they can become vehicles for speculation.  Aligning expectations  The culture of NFTs is the culture of crypto, and therefore filled with hustlers. Investors in NFTs are often buying the idea of a future project or company that has yet to be built. It’s become common parlance on Twitter and Discord for buyers to say “devs do something,” when prices begin to fall.  One buyer of the Warriors playoff collection, Twitter user @jd84722, told CoinDesk he was disappointed in the lack of advertising for the team's NFTs. “They lacked marketing [for] this project big time!"" he said.  But for colossus sports franchises, unlike pure-play NFT projects, there is less of an incentive to pull levers to inflate prices. In fact, that may be opening the doors to controversy, regulatory scrutiny and public backlash.  “We would like them to have strong value over time, for sure, because we want people to feel good about the purchase that they made,” Schneider said. But the Warriors don’t want to create an atmosphere where “people think that they can buy and flip them and make money,” he added.  Teams face a similar dilemma with the resale of game tickets, and have developed mechanisms to reduce ticket scalping – especially online. Franchises may one day sell tickets as NFTs, which could help track bad actors, or complicate the matter with crypto’s hyper-capitalist markets.  It’s unlikely that teams will be able to create blockchain bubbles that isolate fans from these flippers and profit seekers. The future of successful and high-value team NFTs may depend on how well teams weed out or tolerate buyers looking to make an easy dollar.  Where now?  There is no playbook on how an NBA brand should execute its NFT strategy. Schneider pushed for the Warriors’ first NFT collection after a staffer texted him about NBA Top Shot. Though the team has been pleased with its early experiments, the business line is a work in progress, he said.  “Will we do another responsive NFT? I don’t know, probably,” Schneider said. “Will we continue to create NFTs that have different utilities? I think so, I think that’s kind of where things have gone and probably where they’ll continue to head.”  In some sense, the team is taking cues from the recent legalization of sports betting in some states. Like crypto, gambling presents an opportunity for fans to engage with sports in a more active way. It also causes concern.  Following a series of scandals, the NBA has pushed for a set of laws that would legalize gambling while ensuring the integrity of the game and secure a portion of the profits for the league.  See also: Tribalism, Meritocracy, Money: What Sports and Crypto Fans Have in Common | Opinion  NFTs and crypto in general are controversial. Many organizations are criticized for simply exploring pilot programs, because of the crypto industry's notable environmental footprint and rampant scams. But Web3 also presents a path to remunerate participants in traditionally profitless activities and to build communities.  Fans built sports franchises into behemoths through emotional and financial investments in their teams. If NFTs present a path for franchises to give back some of that investment, interest would become only stronger. If there’s dignity in fandom rooted in emotional affiliation, money at stake won’t necessarily dilute that.  At the very least, given the appropriate consumer protections, investable entertainment can be a win-win for fans and teams.

Senators don’t have the technological know-how to confront topics like the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation recently agreed upon by the European Union – or on the related topic of how to tax the sector, Goulet said.  “I’m not sure that today there are 10 senators who are capable of understanding” crypto policy issues, said Goulet, who sits on the Centrist Union political grouping, which is the Senate’s third-largest.  Read more: France's Presidential Candidates Ignore Crypto Issues  The text of the motion formally requesting a new committee, published Friday, is heavy on the negatives of the technology. The document says blockchain may support crime because it “permits anonymity and favors opaque trading,” and compares the market to the subprime mortgages that caused the 2008 financial crisis.  Goulet’s concerns arise from her own background in countering terrorist financing – a topic on which she recently penned a book – as well as warnings given by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde.  But despite her skepticism, Goulet told CoinDesk that she is keeping an open mind about innovations with which she and many of her colleagues are largely unfamiliar.  “If it presents a risk to the economy, one must say so,” she said. “If it has an added value to the economy, one must say so, too. But in any case, we can’t stay in the dark on a subject like this.”  Read more: Outgoing French Lawmaker Calls for Fossil-Based Crypto Mining Ban, DAO Legal Status  Politicians in France are showing rising interest in the crypto world. The country recently awarded regulatory recognition to Binance as part of the country’s wider strategy to set the country up as a crypto hub.  In June, Pierre Person, at the time a lawmaker in France’s National Assembly, penned a report that called for legal recognition of the decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that underpin innovative finance, alongside a ban on mining that uses fossil fuel power.  Setting up the proposed new committee – which would take evidence from the crypto and banking industry at a series of hearings – is not yet a done deal, and in any case wouldn’t happen until recess is over in October.  In the meantime, Goulet said she will try to persuade her colleagues to take an interest, even though they’re currently focused on more pressing issues like rising consumer prices.  Otherwise, she said, “the legislator will have to make decisions on subjects that it hasn’t mastered. It’s not at all reasonable.”  Editor’s note: Statements in this article have been translated from French.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | BNB,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/28/french-lawmaker-calls-for-crypto-committee-as-legal-questions-loom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a66c096255ee8cf46358bcd040500a41af6273e-4191x3143.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Step Finance is a Solana analytics platform with 110,000 monthly active users. Step, which won a Solana Hackathon in March 2021, started as a customer of SolanaFloor. Step is looking to expand its platform to encompass NFTs, and its acquisition of SolanaFloor will take the company one step further in that direction.  Co-founder of Step Finance George Harrap told CoinDesk that there are many new users entering the Solana ecosystem from different angles.  “There are some users who don't really know about DeFi and likewise, a lot of DeFi people who don't really know about NFTs, so the sum is greater than two parts,” Harrap said.  SolanaFloor also won a Solana Hackathon and currently has 23,000 monthly active users. Wazza (a pseudonym), the founder of the platform, said that taking its data to Step will improve the data surrounding the Solana ecosystem.  “Step is pretty much the home for DeFi and we're pretty much the home for NFTs on Solana, so this makes perfect sense,” Wazza said.  Step Finance has been steadily building since its launch last year. Following its success at the hackathon, it raised $2 million from Alameda Research, which is owned by crypto exchange FTX's CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.  Step and SolanaFloor aren’t the only companies breaking into the Solana data insights market. In June, blockchain analytics firm Nansen said it would begin tracking the chain’s data amid its growing NFT minting volume.  Harrap said Step Finance and SolanaFloor plan to implement a blue chip index for NFTs to give broader insights into the Solana ecosystem.

Another crypto exchange succumbs to this year's contagion, as Zipmex files for bankruptcy protection in Singapore.  Just In: The U.S. gross domestic product declined at an annualized pace of 0.9% in the second quarter, marking two consecutive quarters of economic contraction, Helene Braun reports. One widely used definition for a recession is when GDP contracts over two consecutive quarters. However, many economists – and even Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at a press conference on Wednesday – have refrained from calling a recession.  Market Moves: The crypto options market is abuzz as traders scramble to place bets ahead of Ethereum's upcoming ""Merge,"" with open interest in the contracts now at a record.  Chart of The Day: Ether has crossed above the Ichimoku Cloud for the first time since April in an early sign of bullish revival.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was mostly holding steady early Thursday amid a classic risk-off move in traditional markets after data reported by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis showed the world's largest economy contracted in the second quarter.  While bitcoin declined from $23,200 to $22,600 in a knee-jerk reaction to the data, the cryptocurrency was still up 7% on a 24-hour basis and was back over $23,000 by press time.  In traditional markets, the U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, fell 0.3% to 106.60, and the 10-year Treasury yield slipped by five basis points (0.05 percentage point) to 2.74%.  Ether (ETH) traded near $1,360, representing an 11% gain. According to data from Coinalyze, bearish futures positions worth $200 million have been liquidated in the past 24 hours. The forced closure may have added to the increase in ether's price.  Meanwhile, the number of open positions in ether options market rose to a lifetime high of nearly 4 million as traders piled into call options or bullish bets on optimism the impending “Merge” would bring the bitcoin-like store-of-value appeal to the second-largest cryptocurrency. (Read more on this below in Market Moves.)  Zipmex files for bankruptcy  The troubled crypto exchange Zipmex filed applications in Singapore seeking bankruptcy protections amid the threat of legal actions from creditors. Such filings in Singapore grant relief for 30 days or until the Singapore Court makes a decision on the application. Last week, the Singapore-based exchange blocked users from taking direct custody of their coins, sparking fears of an eventual bankruptcy.  Nirvana Finance, a Solana-based yield protocol, suffered a $3.5 million exploit, with attackers using flash loans to drain its liquidity pools. Nirvana’s native token crashed on the news and its NIRV stablecoin lost the dollar peg, falling to 8 cents.  Bipartisan legislation that could establish U.S. regulations for stablecoins has formally been delayed until after the August congressional break. The Treasury Department won’t endorse the bill unless it also ensures the industry exchanges keep their money separate from the companies’ assets, which would protect them if the firms fail, CoinDesk reported.  A study published by the European Central Bank early Thursday said the central bank could set a limit on the number of digital euros in circulation to prevent outflows from traditional banks. Economists put an estimate of optimum amount of digital euros in circulation between 15% and 45% of the gross domestic product.  Elsewhere, the Law Commission of England and Wales – a statutory independent body tasked with reviewing and updating the law – said it wants to apply personal property rules to crypto and non-fungible tokens. That would make it easier for crypto investors to sue in case of losses suffered due to hacks or scams.

Market Moves  Ether options market abuzz ahead as 'Merge' Optimism Drives Demand  The number of open positions in ether's options market has reached a record high as an updated timeline for Ethereum's long-awaited supposedly bullish software update known as the Merge has spurred demand for call options.  Open interest, or the number of options contracts traded but not squared off with an offsetting position, stood at a new lifetime peak of nearly 4 million, according to data from major exchanges, including Deribit, tracked by Swiss-based derivatives analytics firm Laevitas. The previous peak of around 3.5 million was registered in the second quarter.  ""The desk has traded an incredible amount of ETH calls this week, over 250,000 ETH notional,"" Singapore-based options trading giant QCP Capital noted in a Telegram chat.  ""A few hedge fund names have been large buyers of the ETH calls and the overwhelming demand has brought September volumes up to 100%,"" the trading firm said, adding, ""We expect this demand to continue as we approach the Merge in September.""

The funding will be used to accelerate the app’s move into the Web3 space, and with native token SWEAT, users can begin earning crypto for their daily activity.  “There is a huge amount of opportunity to create the economy of movement by creating this token,” Sweat Economy co-founder Oleg Fomenko told CoinDesk.  Founded in 2015 as Sweatcoin – recently rebranded Sweat Economy – aims to inspire users to improve their health through staying active. In doing so, they earn in-app tokens that can be redeemed for products, services and donations.  After seven years of seeking the transition to Web3, Sweat Economy is teaming with Near Protocol to support the app in its token generation. SWEAT will become the new currency for the app that users can earn through daily movement.  Fomenko said a number of chains were considered, but Near was chosen for its vision on bringing Web3 to the world, its team members and its eco-friendly and speedy transactions.  Move-to-earn games have gained popularity in the past year, despite barriers to entry. Stepn, a popular game that motivates users to run to earn crypto, requires players to purchase non-fungible token (NFT) sneakers to play. According to data from Magic Eden, its current floor price is 1.04 SOL, or $44.  Sweat, however, is completely free to play.  Sweat Economy users – which currently number 35 million – will have the opportunity to create an in-app Near wallet following the token generation event (TGE) scheduled for Sept. 12. Once completed, they can then start earning, with 1,000 steps enough to garner one SWEAT token.  “Our mission is to make the world more physically active,” said Fomenko. “Anything we do with our project is there to bring in more motivation for people to put one foot in front of another.”  For now, users will only be able to hold their SWEAT within the app. The tokens will eventually be able to be taken outside the app and used for saving, staking and purchasing NFTs.

42422621,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0nqPh,1659013200,Decentralized Data Platform Space and Time Raises $10M,"Space and Time, a decentralized data warehouse for blockchain applications, raised $10 million in a seed funding round that was led by crypto investment firm Framework Ventures.  The funds will primarily go toward hiring engineers and building out the platform, Space and Time co-founder and CEO Nate Holiday told CoinDesk in an interview.  Space and Time is developing a novel cryptographic protocol called proof-of-SQL, referring to the structured query language programming used to manage and interact with databases. The protocol would allow blockchain applications to rapidly generate analytical insights in a decentralized, low-cost and secure way.  How it works  Space and Time, which started as part of a Chainlink Labs program that supports the development of Web3 startups, uses Chainlink and other sources to pull data from blockchains, decentralized applications and off-chain systems. It’s database processes the data off-chain, avoiding high transaction or gas fees and slow throughput, and then transmits the data to a validation layer to be verified. The validated data is sent back on-chain to smart contracts, which is where the blockchain application that requested the data can see the results.  ""A key issue with decentralized applications is having to work with centralized databases that have the ability to tamper with data,"" Holiday said. ""Users can see data coming in but cannot tell if anyone has added information to that data, which could be done in a malicious way. The proof-of-SQL model would show users evidence of any tampering, such as if someone changed the query results in the middle of the query,"" he added.  Can the end user see the sources of the data in the Space and Time databases?  “We allow the operators of the data to determine what should be encrypted and what shouldn’t,” Holiday explained, using sensitive financial information as an example. ”We’re going to incentivize projects to share their data and to have an open data policy. Whether they have an open data policy or not, we can cryptographically guarantee that the data isn’t tampered with.”  Road map  Apart from Framework, which has $1.4 billion in assets under management, other participants in the round included CoinDesk's parent company Digital Currency Group, Stratos, Samsung Next, IOSG Ventures, Alliance Ventures and others.  Space and Time plans to release the test version of its platform (or testnet) around April 2023 with plans for the mainnet to follow in September of next year. The platform will be connected to major blockchains, including Ethereum, Binance and Polygon.  Holiday noted that games would probably be the first use of the technology, but future Web3 use cases could include social networks, communications or enterprise resource planning. The off-chain processing would ease the currently “untenable” costs of fully on-chain operations.  “If it costs $5 to put out a tweet on a decentralized Twitter application, no one’s going to use it,” Framework co-founder Michael Anderson said. “But if you have the ability to store it securely and very cheaply, that’s something that does enable this new application category.”  Bear market  Venture capital investments in crypto companies were down 26% year-over-year in the first half of 2022 as the bear market emerged.  Asked if Framework has changed its investment strategy because of the bear market, Anderson noted that the firm was started in 2019, which was “sort of the depths of the bear market in that cycle.”  “We feel like we thrive in bear markets because we get to hone in on the core use cases and the best builders,” he said. “Our thesis really hasn’t changed at all. We just now have more time to focus on the things that matter.”  Read more: Framework Ventures Launches $400M Fund to Back Web 3 Gaming, DeFi",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | LINK | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/28/decentralized-data-platform-space-and-time-raises-10m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a42031db22c69d46ab3b1f7ac8ac574c3b9e271-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Foundry is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of CoinDesk.  The new service, Foundry Logistics, is a dedicated supply-chain management service that is able to cut down total transit time for shipments significantly as well as add visibility to various expenses related to shipments, Foundry’s senior vice president of Infrastructure, MK Sathya, told CoinDesk. Such services will not just lower the transit time, but also make internal accounting much easier, Sathya added.  Through Foundry Logistics, miners will also have access to end-to-end tracking that the buyers of Foundry do.  “Through worldwide offices and a network of dedicated on-the-ground contacts for every order, Foundry Logistics ensures cost-effective and streamlined deliveries, providing clients with customs clearance, insurance guidance, ocean shipment solutions, national warehouse solutions and other domestic surface logistics,” the statement added.  Read more: Crypto Mining and Staking Firm Foundry Starts Training Program for Miners  In recent years, supply-chain issues have been plaguing industries across the globe, and bitcoin mining is no different. Due to the capital-intensive nature of the mining industry, miners can't afford to have delays in mining rigs, because they mean extra costs.  “Transit time and efficiency are of great significance in the cryptocurrency-mining industry, where machines’ profitability is dependent on a wide variety of factors, such as bitcoin price and the network’s mining difficulty,” Foundry said in its statement. “This makes the timely delivery of ordered hardware critical to the operation of mining companies.”  Bitcoin-mining computers often don't have a way to regularly track the progress of the ordered equipment in transit, making the process even less transparent and manageable, Foundry said.  Last year, Foundry launched FoundryX, a new marketplace for buying and selling bitcoin-mining machines. Customers using this service will have access to the new supply-chain management system, which will be tailored to each client’s operational needs, according to the statement.

42411449,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNlr6,1659012600,"Advisors, Don’t Let Crypto Optimism Override Practical Thinking","Learning to talk crypto to clients is one thing – figuring out how to rationally discuss an incredibly volatile asset class undergoing a major swoon is yet another.  Journalists and investors focus a lot on crypto prices because, well, they’re easy numbers to understand, and they’re everywhere. We can’t ignore that bitcoin (BTC) and alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) lost 60% or more of their value this year.  “We’re definitely in a down cycle,” said Michael O’Rourke, CEO of Pocket Network. Pocket is a protocol that coordinates infrastructure for blockchain developers and end users around the world. At the same time, he’s optimistic: “Even with the down cycle, I’ve never seen more opportunities and more potential for growth given how many developers are actually coming in.”  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  O’Rourke, whose role at Pocket allows him to track new developers and participants in blockchain ecosystems firsthand, is able to paint an optimistic picture of the course of crypto and decentralized finance projects.  “The number of participants is growing. More blockchains are being launched,” he said. “If anything, the actual growth of crypto and blockchain has actually accelerated, and the best part is that markets like these bring in people who build things the right way and for the right reasons.”  O’Rourke speaks about blockchain technology’s future as a major human coordination mechanism on the level of government, religion and corporations – thus his outlook for the space is incredibly optimistic.  But that messaging clashes with what investors – and your clients – are seeing with their own eyes: the failure of some projects, bankruptcies among some exchanges and falling portfolio values.  What should advisors do?  Err on the side of caution  The first step is to help the client secure their assets, according to Brad Roth, chief investment officer at Thor Financial Technologies, a digital turnkey asset manager.  “Advisors need to educate themselves and partner with the right people to help clients get their crypto assets into a safe place – that has to be first,” Roth said. “Ideally, that means off of exchanges and into cold storage, because what makes me most nervous is clients using random exchanges to try to be day traders of crypto.”  Assets are vulnerable on digital exchanges, which lack liability protection. But cold storage requires that investors take assets out of their hot wallet and move them offline completely. There they cannot be hacked or lost.  Read more: Ledger Nano S Plus Review: Good for Beginners  However, cold storage also means that clients literally hold the digital keys to their own crypto – so if an advisor’s aging client has difficulty keeping track of things like passwords or physical keys, advisors should suggest other options.  The good news is that investors can still gain many of the benefits of owning crypto through alternatives that don’t require holding assets in cold storage.  One alternative is for clients to have their crypto assets secured and held in institutional-grade cold storage.  “Advisors can look into getting [clients] with institutionalized custody,” Roth said. “At Thor, we have custody arrangements with Eaglebrook and others. They really give you safer access to crypto than you would get from trusting some website and hoping you can get to your crypto when you go to do a withdrawal.”  Other options for advisors can be found in certain private placement products like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is traded publicly on the OTCQX, an over-the-counter market. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  GBTC is a bitcoin investment product that clients can buy and hold within their regular brokerage accounts. Although it does not allow them to own bitcoin directly, it mirrors the performance of bitcoin and can allow them to derive similar financial returns.  Encourage investing, not trading  One drawback to having clients invested in crypto is the tendency to treat the asset class the way early investors treated it – as a high-growth speculative play.  “People really have to think through this asset class,” said CK Zheng, co-founder at ZX Squared, a crypto hedge fund. “If they, like me, believe this asset class is long-term investible, they need a long-term plan. They can’t day trade or just look at the next six months or the next three months.”  Frequently trading crypto makes it difficult to find places to safely store crypto and maintain custody, according to Zheng. It also increases the likelihood that the investor locks in losses. Advisors should instead encourage clients to become long-term investors, or “HODLers,” of crypto.  Read more: 6 Ways Advisors Can Help Crypto Investors Avoid Large Losses  Roth says that advisors need to do more to encourage their clients to vent about their crypto holdings: “Advisors also need to talk to clients. Investors are very emotional. In a volatile asset class like bitcoin or ethereum, investors need to be able to keep their emotions in check to succeed.”  Recommend a consistent strategy  Roth and Zheng admit their investing products won’t necessarily be embraced by every investor curious about crypto.  Instead, most investors will choose a self-directed investing approach that enables them to buy and hold crypto assets directly.  In fact, one of the biggest draws of digital assets is that they proliferated first in the self-directed space as innovations created by technologists, not major financial institutions.  Having a simple, repeatable process for investing in crypto can help control emotions and avoid poor decisions, according to Roth.  “I think people need a process for investing into crypto,” he said. “It could be as simple as dollar-cost-averaging and buying-and-holding. Whatever it is, it will help take emotion out of investing in these.”  Provide reasons for optimism  Futurists love blockchain and crypto, and enthusiasts love to proselytize their ideas on how it will continue to be applied to more areas of life, culture and society. However, advisors speaking to skeptical investors will need to offer more conventional, concrete answers.  Advisors could share three such reasons for optimism about the future of crypto, though.  First, crypto will likely be part of a long-term digitization trend in which most financial processes will involve blockchain technology. Eventually, almost any financial asset may be tokenized. This should help increase the long-term value of crypto.  Second, regulation could help, not hinder, the prospects of crypto. “Thus far, we don’t have many regulations in place,” Zheng said. “We’re nowhere near finalized and people can’t really see where we can go in terms of regulation. This bear market has exposed so many of the issues in the space, which will clearly play into future regulation. More certainty in regulation will be bullish for the industry.”  Third, crypto and blockchain adoption is really just in the very early stages, despite the number of people you know that have already heard about it.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/07/28/advisors-dont-let-crypto-optimism-override-practical-thinking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7dfdf21f7ae35c2c0aaa1d4db87177018c2f6beb-6410x4808.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42422633,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0nqfh,1659012362,"GDP Falls Further in Q2, Fueling Talk of a Recession","Gross domestic product declined at an annualized pace of 0.9% in the second quarter, marking two consecutive quarters of economic contraction.  While the report on Thursday morning was worse than economists' forecasts of a 0.5% contraction, it was slightly better than ""whisper"" expectations for a decline of 1% or more. The Federal Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow tracker, for instance, predicted a 1.2% decline in GDP in the second quarter.  Bitcoin (BTC), which had risen sharply in the wake of Wednesday's downgrade of the economy by the U.S. Federal Reserve, slipped $200 following the release of the GDP figure and was recently trading at $22,800.  Th GDP report cited ""decreases in private inventory investment, residential fixed investment, federal government spending, state and local government spending and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by increases in exports and personal consumption expenditures"" as the main drivers for the decline.  The contraction follows an unexpected decline in economic activity of 1.6% in the first quarter, which fueled fears of recession. One widely used definition for a recession is when GDP contracts in two consecutive quarters.  However, many economists – and even Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at a press conference on Wednesday – have refrained from calling a recession because other factors like the labor market show signs of a strong economy. Both the government and the Fed defer to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) to declare a recession, which takes into account employment, personal income and industrial production, in addition to GDP.  “I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession and the reason is there are too many areas of the economy that are performing too well,” Powell said during a press conference on Wednesday. “You tend to take first GDP reports with a grain of salt.""  Central bankers on Wednesday raised the federal-funds rate by 0.75 percentage point, or 75 basis points, in an effort to slow the economy and curb four-decade high inflation. Traders interpreted the statement by the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee as dovish, with stocks jumping after the announcement.  Bitcoin saw its biggest single-day gain in six weeks, surging 8% on Wednesday to $23,416. Ethereum (ETH) rose almost 12% to slightly above $1,600.  Even if the economy isn’t in a recession, raising interest rates for the fourth consecutive month could certainly lead to one, and Powell has repeatedly said that a recession is “a possibility.”  “The Fed can't say, we're trying to push the economy into a recession, but in my opinion they are, because that's the only thing that's going to slow down prices,” Bob Iaccino, chief strategist at Path Trading Partners and co-portfolio manager at Stock Think Tank, said.  “They have no control over Russia, which is part of the inflation problem. They have no control over the supply chain, which is part of the inflation problem. The only thing they can try and do is slow demand,” he said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/28/gdp-falls-further-in-q2-fueling-recession-discussions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7555ed87e99a03983dafa5913174f1259eea29a7-1184x580.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The stablecoin issuer claims that Tether has significantly reduced its exposure to commercial paper over time, from $30 billion at the beginning of the month to $3.7 billion. Reserve For Commercial Paper Of Tether The short-term unsecured debt regularly issued by any corporation is known as commercial papers. The crypto firms decide the commercial paper&apos;s holding value. Other stablecoins are under investigation for their long-term appropriateness following the failure of the Terra UST stablecoins. Tether now faces the challenge of dispelling allegations that its reserves are highly reliant on Chinese commercial paper. Tether hasn&apos;t, however, officially refuted the claim that it lacks reserves for commercial paper. However, the main argument used by detractors to criticize Tether is its 50% reserve of commercial paper. Critics draw attention to the massive exposure of Chinese commercial paper at 50%.

U.K.-based Zodia Markets is a sister company of Zodia Custody, the digital assets safekeeping platform, and both firms share the same majority shareholder in SC Ventures, the venture arm of Standard Chartered.  Zodia Markets is also working closely with Hong Kong-based BC Technology Group, the owner of crypto trader OSL, the companies said on Thursday.  The firm, which has been granted Financial Conduct Authority approval, has gone live with spot trading of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), Zodia Markets CEO Usman Ahmad said.  “What most large financial institutions have done for now is entered crypto via the custody space, as has Standard Chartered with Zodia Custody,” Ahmad said in an interview. “We looked around and saw a gap in the market when it comes to a crypto trading firm with the backing of a bank.”  Major banks have been exploring crypto custody with a number of deals announced in recent months.  Crypto trading is readily available in the Far East and the U.S., a situation that informed Zodia Markets' decision to focus elsewhere, Ahmad said.  “We want to focus on the U.K., Europe, Middle East and Africa as a starting point,” he said. “We looked across this time zone, and this jurisdiction feels, relatively speaking, underserved.”  UPDATE (Aug. 11, 2022, 9:30 UTC): Updates Zodia Markets’ backers",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ASIA | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/28/stanchart-backed-crypto-trading-firm-zodia-markets-goes-live-in-uk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d8661acae598f99ba2b910cfdf1580d186057cd-2928x2196.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422640,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0nqvh,1659008478,Solana DeFi Protocol Nirvana Drained of Liquidity After Flash Loan Exploit,"Nirvana Finance, a Solana-based yield protocol, suffered a $3.5 million exploit utilizing flash loans to manipulate and drain its liquidity pools, blockchain data shows.  The price of the protocol’s native ANA token fell over 80% in the past few hours, while its NIRV stablecoin lost its peg to the U.S. dollar and dropped to 8 cents at writing time, CoinGecko data shows.  Nirvana allowed users to earn annual yields of over 100% on their locked assets by creating and destroying tokens based on user demand as the ANA tokens were bought from and sold to the protocol. Over $3.5 million worth of ANA was locked on the protocol before the attack on Thursday.  Flash loans are a popular way for attackers to gain the funds to conduct exploits on decentralized finance (DeFi) systems. In April, the Beanstalk stablecoin protocol was drained of $182 million, and last month more than $1.2 million was taken from Inverse Finance.  The loans allow traders to borrow unsecured funds from lenders using smart contracts instead of third parties. They do not require any collateral because the contract considers the transaction complete only when the borrower repays the lender. This means a borrower defaulting on a flash loan would cause the smart contract to cancel the transaction and the money would be returned to the lender.  Data from blockchain explorers shows the attack used over 10 million USDC sourced from lending tool Solend in a flash loan. At that point over $10 million worth of ANA was minted, or created, and the entire amount swapped to receive $3.5 million worth of tether (USDT) from Nirvana’s treasury wallet.  This was possible because the treasury considered the 10 million USDC infusion to be genuine. However, it wasn't, and the protocol was hence tricked into releasing its treasury's liquidity.  The total value locked (TVL) on Nirvana fell to 7 cents in European morning hours following the attack. Its entire liquidity pool was effectively drained, data from DeFi Llama shows.  The 10 million USDC was returned to Solend after the exploit. The stolen funds were transferred to the Ethereum network using Wormhole, a blockchain tool that connects Solana to other networks, and converted to DAI, an Ethereum-based stablecoin, blockchain data shows.  The attacker address – 0xB9AE2624Ab08661F010185d72Dd506E199E67C09 – currently holds over $3.5 million worth of DAI, blockchain data shows.  Nirvana’s trading functions were suspended by developers following the attack, as per messages by admins on the protocol’s Telegram channel.

Open interest – the number of options contracts traded but not squared off with an offsetting position – stood at a new lifetime peak of nearly 4 million, according to data from major exchanges, including Deribit, tracked by Swiss-based derivatives analytics firm Laevitas. The previous peak of around 3.5 million was registered in the second quarter.  ""The desk has traded an incredible amount of ETH calls this week, over 250,000 ETH notional,"" the Singapore-based options trading giant QCP Capital noted in a Telegram chat.  ""A few hedge fund names have been large buyers of the ETH calls and the overwhelming demand has brought September volumes up to 100%,"" the trading firm said, adding, ""We expect this demand to continue as we approach the merge in September.""  Martin Cheung, an options trader from Pulsar Trading Capital, said, ""There are big players in September and December expiry, betting on an upside in ether.""  Recently, the spread between prices paid for puts relative to calls has narrowed sharply, indicating renewed demand for calls.  A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market. A put option represents a bearish bet.  The optimism has returned to the ether market ever since Ethereum developer Tim Beiko announced Sept. 19 as a tentative date for the completion of the merge.  As the name suggests, the upgrade will merge Ethereum's current proof-of-work blockchain with a proof-of-stake blockchain called the Beacon Chain, which has been running since 2020. The transition is considered bullish for ether.  ""We’re big fans of Ethereum as an asset. Lately we’re bullish on the idea that the merge will create a wave of price appreciation after creating strong deflationary pressure (in the form of structural demand),"" Jack Niewold, founder of the Crypto Pragmatist newsletter, wrote in Wednesday's edition.  ""While inflation in global economies remains at high levels, ETH will likely become the largest deflationary currency [after the merge],"" Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, said in a research report published on July 23. ""The amount of ether issued will drop by approximately 90% as it will no longer be needed to incentivize miners.""

The findings support a suggestion by ECB’s Fabio Panetta that accounts for the central bank digital currency (CBDC) would be limited to 3,000 euros (US$3,048) per person, to ensure there’s still enough money in conventional finance to support lending.  Inspired by the success of bitcoin (BTC) and private initiatives, like the now-aborted Facebook-backed libra, many central banks around the world are mulling whether to issue a digital fiat currency alongside banknotes and coins. However, cautious European Union officials want to figure out the impact of CBDCs before they take any final decision.  Read more:9 Out of 10 Central Banks Exploring Digital Currency, BIS Says  “Advanced economies have no experience with CBDCs and, hence, there is no available data on which empirical analysis can be performed,” the study said, offering “novel empirical evidence on the impact of digital euro news on bank stock prices and bank lending behavior.”  The team of economists, including ECB Director-General Frank Smets, looked at the impact different kinds of digital euro might have on lending – based, in part, on how previous public statements about the CBDC design affected bank stocks.  The optimum amount of digital euros to have in circulation would be between 15% and 45% of quarterly real gross domestic product (GDP), the economists found. Because the eurozone's quarterly GDP is about 3 trillion euros, Panetta’s suggestion of a 3,000 euro cap would sit pretty much in the middle of that range, at 34%.  Read more: Europe's CBDC Designers Wrestle With Privacy Issues  If left unchecked, a digital euro could prove too popular, the authors warned. “Under no quantity limits and no remuneration, the amount of CBDC in circulation would be larger (i.e., of roughly 65% of quarterly real GDP) and the steady state effects on banks’ valuations and lending would be comparatively more sizable,” the study said.  Panetta, a member of the ECB’s executive board, has suggested that a digital euro could be issued within four years – but first policymakers must grapple with issues like how to assure user privacy.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/28/digital-euro-needs-curbs-to-halt-lending-crunch-ecb-study-finds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/08c5398722299bc54a6a02423243c0eda7edc99c-6549x4912.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Past Performance of AR As teased in our previous article, the AR prices break about the 50-day SMA to challenge the overhead resistance of the 100-day SMA close to $17.50. However, the buyers failed to exceed the opposing SMA resulting in a price fall to the $12 mark. Currently, the prices consolidate within the SMAs after the bullish reversal last night, accounting for a price jump of 17%. Source - Tradingview AR Technical Analysis The recent bullish attempt to exceed the 100-day SMA fails as the prices take a bearish turnaround from the $15 mark.

Bitcoin (BTC) jumped 10% at one point following the Fed announcement, while ether (ETH) soared as much as 16%.  Total market capitalization increased 6.4%, one of the biggest gains in recent weeks as risk appetite returned among investors as they priced in lower rate hikes ahead. Ether led gains among majors, with Solana’s SOL, BNB, and Cardano’s ADA up 6.4% in the past 24 hours. Elsewhere, Uniswap’s UNI and bitcoin cash (BCH) added as much as 21%.  The upward movement caused over $200 million in liquidations on short trades and some $175 million on long trades. Over 72% of all liquidated traders were short positions, meaning a short squeeze may have contributed to some of the price gains among major cryptos in the past 24 hours.  A short squeeze refers to a sharp rise in the price of an asset that forces traders who previously sold short to close out their positions, usually leading to an increase in prices.  Crypto exchange OKX saw over $128 million in liquidations, the most among counterparts, with over 88% of traders betting on lower prices on the exchange.  Shorts are positions betting on market declines, while longs refer to bets on rising prices. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Ether futures saw over $165 million in liquidations across shorts and longs. Data from Coinalyze shows trading volumes on ether has risen in the past weeks and crossed those of bitcoin - which led futures markets volumes.  A catalyst for higher ether volumes is the network’s upcoming Merge in September, which will shift Ethereum away from its current validation mechanism to a proof-of-stake network.",POSITIVE,ADA | BCH | ETH,ADA | BCH | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/28/ether-dominates-futures-trading-as-shorts-see-200m-in-liquidations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d64fd1b7a77e1d19beb84e671e6018b4bd1c701-2475x1856.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374162,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvY4uz,1658999550,Bitcoin Market Awaits US GDP After Biggest Single-Day Gain in 6 Weeks,"The bitcoin market awaits the release of U.S. data that's expected to show the world's largest economy narrowly avoided entering a recession in the second quarter, having drawn relief from Federal Reserve messaging on Wednesday.  The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis' initial reading of second-quarter gross domestic product, due at 12:30 UTC (08:30 a.m. ET), is expected to show the economy grew at a 0.5% annualized rate, rebounding from the first quarter's 1.6% contraction, according to FXStreet.  The data is pivotal as it would reveal the damage caused by inflation being at a 40-year high and could inject volatility into markets. Big data releases on GDP and inflation have moved markets more than ever, with the U.S. central bank ditching forward guidance on Wednesday and making future policy moves ultimately more dependent on data.  The Fed defines forward guidance as ""a tool that central banks use to provide communication to the public about the likely future course of monetary policy.""  Risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC), could rally if GDP unexpectedly contracts for a second straight quarter, confirming a technical recession. A recession would bolster investors' expectations of slower interest-rate increases and eventual easing of constraints on money supply.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell ""keeps saying 'data dependent,' which is a sign that they are worrying about recession and if one prints, they may back off hikes or QT [quantitative tightening or balance sheet runoff],"" VBL, a pseudonymous trader and author of the popular ""GoldFix & Bitcoin"" newsletter and podcast, wrote in the Fed review published Wednesday.  ""GDP is out this week. If that comes in negative or just very weak, stocks could really, really rally. This will signal a recession, the Fed will not talk as much and stocks may ramp higher until the Fed does talk,"" VBL said. Bitcoin is currently moving in tandem with stocks.  GDP estimates could be underestimating the second-quarter growth rate, however, because the survey was conducted before Wednesday data that showed a narrower goods-trade deficit and an increase in the core capital goods orders in June. Both the trade deficit and core capital goods are components of GDP.  At press time, markets seem convinced that the Fed will opt for slower rate increases in the coming months. ""The immediate priority is getting a grip on inflation, but we think the Fed will switch to 50 [basis point] hikes at the September and November [Federal Open Market Committee] meetings with a final 25bp hike in December,"" analysts at ING noted in comments posted after the Fed decision.  Risk assets surged on Monday after Powell said the central bank would likely need to slow the rate increases at some point. The policy statement acknowledged the recent softening in consumer spending and production. Powell's comments overshadowed the second-consecutive 75 basis point rate hike.  Bitcoin jumped 8% Wednesday, its biggest single-day percentage gain since June 19. The move appears to have opened doors for continued bullish action.  ""Nice uptick on bitcoin after the FOMC raise rates by 75 bps, meeting expectations,"" Secure Digital Markets, a Toronto-based digital assets brokerage, said in a Telegram-based research channel. ""Technically, we are seeing a very clean breakout to the upside, which started ahead of the data, seeing institutions taking heavy positions on the back of a more dovish FED stance.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/28/bitcoin-awaits-us-gdp-after-biggest-single-day-gain-in-6-weeks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/44413f5d6472a458a80ae91d3501af0abc8b00b6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The commission avoids cryptocurrencies that serve only as payment methods in the consultation document, which solicits opinions from legal and technological experts. Instead, it concentrates on digital assets that can be traded, utilized as stores of value, or represented by other assets. The document also makes the case that because digital assets differ from traditional physical assets in &apos;many diverse elements&apos; and &apos;unique traits,&apos; the U.K.&apos;s current property rules cannot adequately account for them.

Broader market weakness has also contributed to Ethereum&apos;s current price action. Bitcoin had fallen to the $20,000 price mark and altcoins depicted similar price movements. Ethereum over the last 24 hours depicted some minor appreciation on the chart. The altcoin&apos;s technical outlook remained bearish. Buying strength had fallen over the past two days and at press time the coin &apos;s movement was dominated by sellers. Continued selling pressure can pull ETH to the $1,100 price level before it starts to pick up momentum again. In case the bulls find their way back into the market, ETH might continue to consolidate on its chart and then try to rise. Buying strength also has to recover significantly for Ethereum to invalidate the bearish thesis. Over the last week, Ethereum lost 4% of its market value. Ethereum Price Analysis: Four Hour Chart ETH was exchanging hands at $1472 at the time of writing. After Ethereum witnessed a sharp fall, it tried to recover slowly but bearish pressure was still strong in the market. Overhead resistance for the altcoin was at $1,542 and a current fall in price will drag ETH to $1,260.
