42431862,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN76th,1588711601,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Volatility Higher Than S&P 500 Again but Lower Than Oil,"In the ever-curiouser markets of 2020, bitcoin is only slightly more volatile than the S&P 500 and nowhere close to the bumpy ride oil has been on.       In early trading at 00:00 UTC, the world’s oldest cryptocurrency was in $8,800 territory before jumping as high as $9,125 on spot exchanges like Coinbase.      After that quick run-up, bitcoin quickly sold off back to $8,800 levels at 11:00 UTC (7 a.m. EDT). With 10-day and 50-day technical indicator moving averages signaling tepid sentiment Tuesday, bitcoin is experiencing little trading action, staying at the $8,800 price range. At press time bitcoin (BTC) was trading up less than a percent over 24 hours at $8,945.      The sideways action, also known as “consolidation,” is a pattern of predictable behavior during which traders like Jack Tan, founding partner at Taiwan-based crypto trading firm Kronos Research, seek various price levels in which to trade in and out.      “We are still in a consolidation phase as the next level is $14,000, I believe,” said Tan. “I think $8,400-ish should hold on the daily chart. If not, then it invalidates the bullish thesis.”      Read more: Bitcoin Briefly Hits $9K, Investors Remain Bullish      For a crypto trader to call a range between $8,400 to $14,000 is a pretty wide guess and a sign volatility could be the name of the game for the next week or two. After a brief period in which the S&P 500 was more volatile than bitcoin, the latter regained its status as the rockier asset last week, though only slightly so. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 index of U.S. stocks was up less than a percent.      Bitcoin volatility rising a bit since late April is likely making it harder for traders to figure out what’s going to happen before and after the network’s once-in-four-year reward halving from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC, set for approximately May 12.      Pascal Gauthier, CEO of cryptocurrency hardware wallet maker Ledger, said his company has been doing brisk sales of devices and solutions for investors to store crypto ahead of the 2020 halving. It’s something he witnessed four years ago, in July 2016, when the bitcoin reward dropped from 25 to 12.5 BTC.      Read more: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Nears All-Time High in Before Halving      “Despite external pressure on the stock market, we had our best April ever.” said Gauthier. ”The crypto market continues to climb, in a trend very similar to what we saw pre-halving in 2016.”      Despite the cryptocurrency’s reputation as a risky, volatile asset, in these unprecedented and often unpredictable times oil is actually much more volatile than either the S&P 500 or bitcoin - by a large margin.      The massive spike in oil volatility arrived in April following a historic tumble in price for a barrel of crude to as low as $2 on the open market. Oil is having another double-digit price gain Tuesday, up 12.8% and priced at $26.54 as of 20:20 UTC (4:20 p.m. EDT). Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst for online trading at investments provider IG, doesn’t expect oil’s volatility to subside anytime soon, either.      Read more: Amid Economic Meltdown, Bitcoin Winning as ‘No Value’ Buffett Eats Crow      “Everyone was clearly too bearish down at $10 and lower,” Beauchamp said. “But with the price up almost three-fold from its April low, the polar opposite risk now looms. Storage constraints and oversupply problems have not disappeared, while demand is only set to recover modestly.”    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board were mixed Tuesday. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), lost less than a percent in 24 hours as of 20:20 UTC (4:20 p.m. EDT).      Winners include iota (IOTA) up 1% and lisk (LSK) in the green less than a percent. Cryptocurrency losers include tron (TRX) in the red 1.6% and ethereum classic (ETC) down less than a percent. All price changes were as of 20:20 UTC (4:20 p.m. EDT) Tuesday.      Read more: As Tether Supply Hits Record Highs, It Moves Away From Original Home      Gold is trading up less than a percent and closed the New York trading session at $1,708.      U.S. Treasury bonds were mixed. Yields, which move in the opposite direction as price, were down most on the two-year, coming into the red at 3.9%.      The FTSE Eurotop 100 index of the largest European companies was up 2.1% on optimism in the energy sector, despite oil’s volatility.      The Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo was closed for holiday.

A respected researcher thinks he’s found the reason: BitMEX.      If the crypto derivatives exchange used more efficient technologies when broadcasting transactions, users could save as much as roughly 1.7 bitcoin (worth more than $15,000 at press time) in fees every day, or about 7 percent of total daily fees paid, argues pseudonymous bitcoin engineer 0xb10c.      ""The daily broadcast has a significant impact on the Bitcoin network and user fees,"" 0xb10c wrote in a recent report.      Nearly every time a user sends a bitcoin transaction, they tack on a (usually) small fee along with it. Fees fluctuate all the time, depending on how much congestion is in the network. That's because there is limited space for transactions to go through. If there are too many transactions sent at the same time, miners will prioritize ushering through those with higher fees. Those with smaller fees will have to wait.      Read more: Bitcoin’s Crash Triggers Over $700M in Liquidations on BitMEX      Because BitMEX broadcasts thousands of transactions at once at the same time every day, it leads to a fee increase every day, 0xb10c contends.       ""Every day at around 13:08 UTC (9:08 a.m. ET), multiple megabytes of optimized transactions, mostly user withdrawals, are broadcast by BitMEX. The effect is immediately noticeable as a spike in the fee rates, which estimators recommend and users pay,"" 0xb10c told CoinDesk. His research indicates that this has been going on since at least September.      BitMEX, which is based in Seychelles, argued that the startup has had other more pressing priorities.      “Our starting point will always be the safety and security of our users’ trading experience. BitMEX has never lost funds due to a hack or any form of intrusion. We have a world-class security team and are committed to the continuous improvement of our systems and processes,"" a BitMEX spokesperson told CoinDesk.      0xb10c has been writing a series of posts about insights he gleaned as he built the Bitcoin Transaction Monitor, a data tool for exploring transactions on the network in detail.    Fee pressure    Most bitcoin wallets have fee estimators built in that estimate what fee a user should add to a transaction to ensure it is accepted in a timely fashion. If the network is handling too many transactions at once and the fee is too small, it could take longer for the transaction to go through.       Because of BitMEX's many transactions going on at once, clogging the blockchain, the estimators move the fee up and many users pay them.     BitMEX broadcasts thousands of bitcoin transactions at once at the same time every day, leading to a fee increase every day.    While users obviously prefer lower fees, higher fees strengthen the network’s security, especially when block rewards (miners’ main source of income right now) decrease every four years, 0xb10c added. The third halving of mining rewards is expected to take place next week and has only highlighted long-term worries about network security.      That said, developers and other bitcoin enthusiasts have long been trying to push big exchanges and wallet providers (far beyond just BitMEX) to adopt scaling technologies that could cut fees and make the network run more efficiently. These include Segregated Witness, or SegWit, a scaling upgrade that became available in 2017.      ""It’s a bit strange to realize that fees would be close to 0 if exchanges used better practices. Their profligacy helps maintain the fee pressure,"" tweeted Nic Carter, co-founder of crypto data provider CoinMetrics, in response to 0xb10c’s research.      BitMEX agreed on this point, saying that new upgrades are important for the health of the network and that implementing them is important to the company.      ""We recognize the importance of improving the efficiency of our interaction with the Bitcoin network and are working on implementing new systems, including SegWit. Looking more broadly, we are also donating to and partnering with selected developers and institutions to advance the software capability and future stability of the Bitcoin network. This will also help to reduce transaction fees,” the spokesperson said.      Illustrating the problem, on March 12, the day bitcoin’s price crashed in tandem with the equity markets as the coronavirus pandemic shook the world’s economies, the usage of SegWit-updated nodes dropped 5%.       Binance, the world’s largest exchange, saw outsized volume on March 11-12 – over $1 billion and $945 million respectively instead of the seven-day rolling average across January and February of $637 million, according to CryptoCompare – but hadn’t yet moved to SegWit wallets. Binance spokesperson Jessica Jung said the exchange has not updated to SegWit, “but it's in the pipeline.”      Read more: BitMEX Restricts Access to Japanese Residents, Citing Changes to Local Law      Beyond SegWit, 0xb10c recommended BitMEX use ""output batching,"" a years-old technique of cramming many transactions into one to save on transaction space. He also mentioned Schnorr/Taproot, a Bitcoin upgrade that's been in the pipeline for years that some developers estimate will finally be deployed over the next year.      ""By utilizing scaling techniques, some of which have been industry standards for multiple years, the impact could be reduced. BitMEX is stepping in the right direction by planning to switch to nested SegWit. They, however, shouldn’t stop there,"" 0xb10c wrote.      William Foxley contributed reporting.

42431856,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN76fh,1588705957,"As Pandemic Decimates Startups, Privacy Industry Holds Strong","Buoyed by scandals including Facebook and Cambridge Analytica and the perennial reports of breaches at companies including Equifax and Marriott, the data privacy industry has expanded significantly over the last few years.      The information privacy and security industry was worth an estimated $124 billion in 2019, according to Gartner. The increased demand for privacy-guarding products is driven partly by new laws such as Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, the research group says.      Before coronavirus, polls showed Americans becoming increasingly wary of Big Tech. But more recent surveys show people developing a rosier view. Strong majorities support Google and Apple leading contact tracing efforts, and believe tech firms can “accelerate positive trends on the other side of the curve,” according to the National Research Group market research firm.      Yet, at the same time startups in the U.S., including tech startups, have laid off over 30,000 people. This raises the question: Can privacy and security startups survive the financial upheavals of COVID-19?      Rather than a devastating blow, some startups and venture capital firms see this as an opportunity.      Wei Shi Khai, chief operating officer at LongHash Ventures, a global blockchain accelerator and investor, expects interest in privacy-related tech to increase. As factors, he pointed to the rising importance of digital identities in the age of contact tracing, the ever-shifting balance between surveillance and privacy, and the possibility of digital currency to streamline welfare programs.      Of course, some weak companies will fail during this crisis, but not necessarily privacy-related ones, said Pierre Valade, the CEO of Jumbo, a privacy startup that brings together the tracking settings on various sites across the internet into one app where you can manage them more easily.      See also: For Contact Tracing to Work, Americans Will Have to Trust Google and Apple      He says people will continue to want privacy products because they still play such an important role in the world, given how much of our world is lived online.      “There are privacy debates right now about contact tracing, and Bluetooth versus location tracking,” said Valade. “And I think there is a false question we ask people about whether they want to be tracked or want to have value from the services in their lives, and the reality is you can have both.”      To Valade, solutions like Jumbo let you continue to use social media while maintaining control over what information you’re giving out. He says the desire for such services will be sustainable, especially at a time when so much of our interaction is online.      Anne Fauvre-Willis, head of marketing at Oasis Labs, which offers private data sharing services on blockchain, said issues like contact tracing have allowed people to appreciate the tradeoffs at play between privacy on the one hand and the need to use tech for health monitoring purposes.      “It’s clear that contact tracing is critical for the stop of COVID-19, but only if we can find a way to reduce data fragmentation and give consumers assurances that their data will remain confidential,” said Fauvre-Willis. Using a distributed blockchain network could ensure confidentiality and user autonomy, she said.      Ed Yu, CEO of StrongSalt, which offers an encryption platform as a service, says the privacy industry is fundamentally in wait-and-see mode – not much different from other industries right now.      “Everyone needs to weather the slowdown and the downturn,” said Yu in an email. “However, overall, I believe the privacy industry might see a resurgence because as working remotely potentially becomes a normal option after the crisis passes, being able to offer better privacy for remote employees will see a bigger demand.”    VCs aren’t tipping their hand    Startups are often quick to tout their staying power, regardless of the circumstances.      Getting an accurate read on the state of an industry in normal times can be tricky, to say nothing of the extreme circumstances that arise during a pandemic. Multiple venture capital firms declined to be interviewed for this article, but by speaking to analysts firms and startup founders who have been through the venture capital ringer a few times, you can begin to get a sense of the situation.      “Our niche is in fundraising at the early stage, and there has been a growing shift in investor sentiment, particularly towards later stage deals that typically show more traction,” said Wei. “For now, most startups have cut costs, tightening their focus on revenue generating activities or building their product so that they are prepared for future growth once the situation improves.”    It’s clear contact tracing is critical for the stop of COVID-19, but only if we can find a way to reduce data fragmentation and give consumers assurances their data will remain confidential.    Wei said that within the industry the startup and VC sectors have rallied together in a positive manner. Most recently, he said, a number of prominent Southeast Asian venture capital firms came together to consolidate their hiring efforts for laid-off employees affected by the pandemic. Support is also being offered to startups in other ways, including hackathons that create a nurturing environment for projects to experiment and build ideas from the ground up.      Krisha Anne is the CEO and co-founder of Jitsuin, a company that leverages blockchain and other tools to ensure secure and reliable data from industrial internet of things devices, such as smart factories or smart cities.      “Privacy and security are here to stay,” said Anne. “It’s an issue everywhere and this is a huge opportunity for private permissioned blockchains. I'm not an expert in cryptocurrency, but private permissioned blockchains for enterprise use is something we’re seeing people be very receptive to right now.”      Anne, who previously helped launch and then sell another startup, thinks about the venture capital perspective in a few ways. If you’re trying to start raising capital, or were just about to over the last few months, you may just be out of luck. He said it’s unlikely firms would be looking to help launch companies in this environment. Looking at the startups around him, it really depends on what stage of the company you’re in, Anne said.      “The VCs are trying to keep their own portfolio of companies afloat and aren’t looking at starting on new investments,” said Anne.      Duncan Greatwood, the CEO of Xage Security, which provides a decentralized platform for protecting the industrial internet of things, said getting startup funding in this landscape is certainly challenging. While Xage saw a pause in demand as customers tried to sort out their own businesses, Greatwood said his company has a comfortable runway. In this remote environment, he said, companies are seeing information and data security as key to their continued operations.      See also: COVID-19 Tracing Apps Have to Go Viral to Work. That’s a Big Ask      Greatwood doesn’t think venture capital firms have stopped thinking of new deals, just fewer of them. “So if you’ve already got a lot of momentum, as we do, then that can actually put you in a stronger position,” he said.      The remote environment is also forcing companies to think differently.      According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), which analyzes tech markets, a recent survey about the impact of COVID-19 has revealed that while many companies are thinking of decreasing IT budgets, the vast majority see security spending staying the same or increasing.      “The move to remote working and widespread use of shadow IT devices has multiplied cybersecurity risks,” creating a huge opportunity for security-focused companies, said Radoslav Dragov, the Blockchain Lead for Europe at IDC. “Phishing campaigns are also more likely to be successful in the current environment of uncertainty and anxiety. It's likely that security spending of enterprises will focus less on hardware solutions and more on outsourcing services to properly secure a remote workforce.”    Will the behemoths win out?    As startup layoffs continue, and with U.S. unemployment at historic highs, it’s fair to wonder who will be left standing when life returns to some semblance of normal.      As people are consigned to rarely venturing beyond the walls of their homes, their reliance on digital tools for socializing, buying goods and working have exponentially increased.      And the same companies that spurred the backlash against Big Tech — and in turn helped give rise to many privacy and security-oriented startups — might be the ones left standing.      Amazon’s business is surging, and it’s hiring thousands of people to meet the demand. Facebook is also seeing rising traffic, and the company said it will be looking to hire 10,000 people across its product and engineering teams ahead of the 2020 elections.      The people who end up at these companies may well be those who previously wanted the creativity and innovation that a startup had to offer, only to see those opportunities crumble under the weight of economic duress.      See also: Road to Consensus: Harry Halpin Talks Holistic Privacy, Mixnets and COVID-19 (of Course)      Roger Lee, a startup executive who has been tracking layoffs, said this dynamic could lead to the tech giants improving their position at the expense of smaller startups.      “In an economic downturn, employees might even prefer the safety of tech giants versus the risk of a startup,” said Lee. “That’s really important to employees when they’re looking at their next role. So between the cash position of these companies, the need for others to do layoffs, and the talent fight between these groups, this could potentially enrich the tech giants at the expense of small startups.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/05/as-pandemic-decimates-startups-privacy-industry-holds-strong,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5784c768bdd8f9e2ec5d00aa6ecd39d9587ae7b8-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) is moving to quickly enforce enhanced Dutch anti-money laundering (AML) laws, which passed the Dutch Parliament last month to comply with the European Union’s AML directives and standards set by the Financial Action Task Force.      DNB’s speedy regulatory flex – the Dutch Upper House passed its “amended” Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD4) laws on April 21 – threatens firms that convert crypto and fiat or offer crypto custody services with immediate cease-and-desist orders if they do not register by the deadline. Crypto-to-crypto companies do not need to register.      The deadline comes as Dutch crypto firms level heavy criticism at a law they call burdensome to the industry at large.

Firms that fail to register “must therefore cease your existing activities” on May 18 and face fines and “enforcement action,” DNB wrote in its press release. The release noted a draft application was sufficient to fulfill the registration needs for the mid-May date.      The call to action appears to formalize a similar registration notice sent in September 2019, months after the EU released its fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive but before the Dutch Parliament agreed on its version. AMLD5 gave EU member states until Jan. 10 to implement the directive.      But the Dutch Parliament did not strengthen its AML laws until April 21.

42431863,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN76vh,1588699527,"Blockchain Bites: Hyperledger Makes Inroads, Bitcoin Gets 'Harder' and Buffett's Not 'Halving' It","There's a lot of action happening in enterprise-grade blockchains.      Big Blue's preferred chain, Hyperledger, is being tapped by three energy grid operators, a new consortium to establish digital identities for public and private organizations and has been shown to perform better than expected in a medical supply chain pilot.      You're reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they're significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here.      Elsewhere in the crypto-verse, Bitcoin's difficulty setting is increasing while Ethereum is seeing a burst in transactions. Though both may soon face a stiff competition following the launch of NEAR. Here's the story:    Top Shelf    Big Blue Goes Green With Blockchain IBM has created a new blockchain consortium with three of Europe’s electricity grid operators to help smooth the transition to renewable sources of energy. The Equigy platform will use Hyperledger Fabric to share charging data between consumers, aggregators and three energy providers in Northern and Southern Europe.      Digital Identities on Hyperledger The ToIP Foundation is building a solution to the problem of digital identity and how to maintain trust between various counterparties. A vast ecosystem of public bodies and private companies, including Mastercard, IBM and the Canadian Province of British Columbia, are working on establishing decentralized digital trust, which will live within the Linux Foundation.      Drug Blockchain Better Than Expected IBM, Merck, Walmart and KPMG’s drug-tracing blockchain pilot on Hyperledger Fabric has exceeded the benchmarks outlined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the group announced Monday. In their final report to the FDA, the partners said, ""This technology might be able to address the foundational requirement of track and trace for [the Drug Supply Chain Security Act] in addition to establishing trust between trading partners.""      Reweighing Gram Returns Telegram won’t repay its investors in gram tokens after all. After twice delaying the launch of its TON blockchain, the company is contractually obligated to pay investors back 72% of their investments immediately, but has offered to pay investors 110% of their investment in equity or gram tokens if they wait a year for the network to go live. Lawyers advised the firm ""not to pursue an option involving grams or another cryptocurrency due to its uncertain reception from the relevant regulators.""      'It's Gravy,' Turkish Authorities Said iMiner, a Turkey-based company, has been granted a license to operate up to 6,000 mining rigs. The mining company has so far spent 311 billion rials ($7.3 million) on setting up the biggest mining operation in the country to date.      Getting Harder Bitcoin mining difficulty – a measure of how hard it is to compete for block rewards – has neared an all-time high in the network’s last adjustment before the halving event, roughly seven days away. This adjustment is the second time mining difficulty has topped the 16 trillion threshold and follows the second-largest decline in the network’s history in late-March.      Ethereum Killer? NEAR, a blockchain project that aims to compete with Ethereum, closed a $21.6 million token sale led by Andreessen Horowitz and joined by some 40 other investment firms including Pantera Capital, Libertus, Blockchange and Animal Ventures. The proof-of-stake blockchain launched on April 22.      Busy Days Meanwhile, Ethereum’s network is experiencing its busiest days in 10 months amid increased issuance of stablecoins and the runup to Ethereum 2.0. The seven-day moving average of the total number of confirmed transactions on Ethereum’s blockchain rose to 845,400 on April 30 to hit the highest level since July 1 , 2019, according to the data source Coin Metrics.      Milestone Block Ethereum has mined 10 million blocks in five years of existence. Ethereum’s protocol prints a new block every 20 seconds, compared to Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism, which usually will create a new block of transactions every 10 minutes. (Decrypt)      New Suit Puerto Rico-based Bitcoin Manipulation Abatement filed a lawsuit against Ripple and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, alleging they had violated securities laws when hosting its $1.1 billion XRP sale. Incorporated last year, BMA accuses Ripple of publicly promoting the sale to investors to drive up demand and maximize profits, without registering the sale with the relevant regulator.      Ongoing Suit The long and tumultuous lawsuit between Craig Wright and the brother of his former business partner has a tentative trial date, July 6. The Kleiman estate is suing the self-declared inventor of Bitcoin for half of the suspected one million bitcoin trove Wright had mined with Dave Kleiman. (Decrypt)      Trade Function Trading messaging platform Paradigm will launch a trading feature that makes it easier to execute derivatives trades. (The Block)      Salty Hackers A hacking group has installed crypto mining malware into a company server through a weakness in Salt, a popular infrastructure tool used by the likes of IBM, LinkedIn and eBay. ""The mining attempt spiked CPUs and quickly overloaded most of our systems, which alerted us to the issue immediately,” an incident report reads.      The Long Read Fintech guru David Birch wrote ""The Currency Cold War: Cash and Cryptography, Hash Rates and Hegemony,"" a book that seemingly foresaw the future. What was once a niche theory, that digital dollars could displace the sovereignty of money, is now front of mind for central bankers, regulators and the builders of new monetary systems. The world, it appears, is heading to a Cold War between a competing set of programmatic currencies, all with their own designs and purposes. Birch sits down with Jeff Wilser to discuss the coming state of the world where we will have to choose between “between the Federal Reserve and Microsoft (between dollar bills and Bill’s dollars)? Between Facebook’s Libra and China’s Digital Currency/Electronic Payment (DCEP) system? Between spendable drawing rights (SDRs) and Kardashian kash?”    CoinDesk Live: Lockdown Edition    CoinDesk Live: Lockdown Edition continues its popular twice-weekly virtual chats via Zoom and Twitter, giving you a preview of what’s to come at Consensus: Distributed, our first fully virtual – and fully free – big-tent conference May 11-15.

Still, on-chain data suggests spiking investor interest. The seven-day average of the number of unique addresses active on the network rose to the highest level since June 29, 2019. “We have observed a significant increase in ‘new money’ entering the ecosystem,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack.      Not for Buffett Billionaire investor Warren Buffett says he's having a hard time finding attractive investments as the coronavirus ravages the global economy. Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency the 89-year-old Buffett described in February as having ""no value,"" is up 23% this year to about $8,870. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, which Buffett routinely endorses for amateur investors, is down 12%. CoinDesk's First Mover team reports, shares of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett's insurance-to-utilities conglomerate, are down 21% in 2020.

42404618,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdj4u7,1588689313,"As Tether Supply Hits Record Highs, It Moves Away From Original Home","Tether growth is hitting new all-time highs across multiple blockchains, but the first protocol to support Tether is being left behind.      Omni Layer, built on Bitcoin, has suffered negative growth in Tether transactions for the last 12 consecutive months. Tether supply on Omni Layer has also fallen more than 50% over the same period, according to Coin Metrics.      Omni Layer’s Tether supply peaked in mid-2018 at just over $3 billion. Tether tokens first launched on Omni Layer in October 2014. While fluctuations in stablecoin supply and transaction counts happen regularly, it’s unusual for there to be a contraction in supply for months at a time, especially for Tether.      Omni Layer was the only one to support Tether for over three years until the stablecoin launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum in November 2017. In less than two years, Ethereum’s share of Tether’s total circulating supply eclipsed Omni Layer’s.      Disparate Tether growth across different protocols probably is due to “current demand on each chain,” said Sean Gilligan, developer at Omni Layer. Tether can move unused tethers on Omni Layer to another chain with higher demand by issuing a simple “revoke” transaction, Gilligan explained.    'Crazy expensive' reason for the move    Performance concerns across Tether-supported protocols seem to be driving demand on platforms like Ethereum and away from Omni Layer.      “I think it mostly comes down to Ethereum being much better payment rails for something like Tether and other stablecoins,” said Anthony Sassano, adviser to mStable, a stablecoin unification protocol.      Transaction fees and confirmation times were the primary reasons Tether decided to evolve its stablecoin into a cross-chain asset supported by multiple protocols, according to Paolo Ardoino, CTO at Tether.    At Tether, we truly care for Omni, since it was the first protocol that made Tether possible, and it also relies on Bitcoin security. But we had to give traders what they were asking for.    Traders were routinely worried about sudden spikes in Bitcoin transaction fees that caused arbitrage trades to become “crazy expensive,” said Ardoino. The other concern, confirmation times, resulted from some exchanges waiting for three Bitcoin blocks to credit Omni Layer transactions, which could mean “losing the moment in the market.”      “Omni on Bitcoin provides users with multisig and a level of robustness that other chains may lack, while some chains may have lower transaction fees or faster blocks,” said Craig Sellars, co-founder of Tether and chief technologist of Omni. “It’s all about the users’ preference as to which capabilities they want to imbue their digital dollars.”      See also: Bitfinex, Tether Seek Subpoenas Across US in Hunt for Missing $800M      Multisignature (multisig) security means more than one digital signature is required to execute a transaction.      Ethereum currently holds the lion’s share of Tether’s supply, with nearly 3.5 billion tokens issued on Ethereum since February. Tron, a protocol similarly optimized for token issuance, holds nearly as many tokens as Omni Layer, at the time of publication.      “At Tether, we truly care for Omni, since it was the first protocol that made Tether possible, and it also relies on Bitcoin security. But we had to give traders what they were asking for,” said Ardoino.      “A faster, cheaper ledger with more granular levels of control is much more useful to [Tether],” said Eric Wall, chief investment officer at Arcane Assets. “USDT, by virtue of being a centralized asset, does not benefit much from Bitcoin's expensive state-attacker-grade censorship-resistance.”      Censorship resistance to coordinated attacks from state governments is a primary feature of established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. For stablecoins, however, the benefits of this high-level security may be limited.    One stablecoin for different blockchains    To date, Tether has tested eight different protocols: Omni Layer, Ethereum, Litecoin, Tron, EOS, Algorand, Liquid Network and Bitcoin Cash. All of them currently support Tether except Litecoin.      In fact, Tether’s cross-chain evolution is a dominant competitive strategy for the stablecoin. Tether quickly seized on the simple growth strategy of providing each blockchain community with access to the cryptocurrency industry’s oldest and most liquid stablecoin.      See also: Tether Stablecoin Launches on Its Seventh Blockchain      “Each of these blockchains need a stablecoin in order to implement DEXes, DeFi projects and many other projects,” said Ardoino. “It's astonishing that till today our competition did not realize that yet,” he said.      “I think that USDT will continue to be a multi-blockchain asset,” said Sassano, adding that the status quo rate of Ethereum use and development makes him think most of Tether’s supply will “live on Ethereum for the long term.”      Regardless of what the future holds for Tether’s continued growth, the Omni Layer will always consider itself to be a special place for Tether. “Omni Layer on Bitcoin is [Tether’s] home, but it has other places to go when it wants to go skiing or skydiving,” said Sellars.

42404603,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdj4hK,1588688819,4 Ways COVID-19 Will Bring Banks and Regulators to Crypto,"Ajit Tripathi, a CoinDesk columnist, is an executive director at Binance and the crypto co-host of the Breaking Banks Europe podcast. Previously, he served as a Fintech Partner at ConsenSys and a co-founder of PwC’s U.K. Blockchain Practice. The opinions expressed here are his personal views.     1. Increasing policy influence    The crypto community was remarkably prescient in its prognosis of how coronavirus was going to impact the global economy and society. Through the long months when political leaders and the World Health Organization (WHO) were reluctant to declare a global pandemic and take firm action, many well-known voices on Crypto Twitter, including @balajis, @naval, @twobitidiot and others, were predicting a repeat of Wuhan across the world.       The WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic almost three months after Crypto Twitter exploded in concern about Wuhan going into a full lockdown. In the U.K., where I live, Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested Britain should take a different approach from the rest of the world and seek “herd immunity.” Crypto Twitter and Reddit challenged his claims vigorously. Such a stark difference between the dangerous nonchalance of the fiat world and the accurate prognosis of the crypto community says something about the mental makeup of people who’re drawn to crypto – curious, not satisfied with the status quo and more interested in possibility than in the current reality.       See also: Money Reimagined: As Tech, Politics and COVID-19 Collide, a Global Reset Looms      Historically, the journey of the crypto community through policy circles has not been easy. There has been a huge generation gap between the fearful Boomers that design markets and economies today, and often equally irrational bitcoin maximalists who dominate debate in the crypto community. In my own personal experience interacting with regulators around the world. Now, on-point, insightful voices like Chamath Palihapitiya and Balaji Srinivasan are finally being noticed in policy circles as providing a valuable perspective to challenge conventional wisdom and that simple shift will fundamentally change the discourse around crypto going forward.     2. Banks will finally hold bitcoin    Historically regulators around the world have been extremely cautious in allowing banks to touch cryptocurrencies. Even in Switzerland, where crypto banks like SEBA and Sygnum have seen some traction, and in Germany, where more than 40 banks have sought crypto custodian licenses, Basel capital requirements for holding cryptocurrencies have been prohibitive. There’s been a presumption the post-Basel III (i.e. post-2009) banking system is functioning well and the issues of the last financial crisis have been addressed. That means banks must avoid unfamiliar and volatile asset classes like cryptocurrencies.       Now the COVID-19 bailout, and the repo crisis that preceded COVID-19, have shown that Basel III and IV did little more than shift systemic risk from the banking system to the shadow banking system. Everyone from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to macro investing legends like Ray Dalio have been humbled by this entirely white swan event. This newfound humility will lead to a reexamining of our reliance on complex mathematics to hide mountains of debt and the magic word “scarcity” will be back in fashion again. When banks go looking for scarce assets for the sake of long term stability of their balance sheets, most will choose gold but a significant number will choose digital gold – i.e. bitcoin.     3. OECD central banks will launch digital currencies    In March, a month before the U.K. economy locked down, the Bank of England released an exceptionally well crafted paper on the potential benefits of retail CBDC. As I wrote previously, retail CBDCs can have this “little guy bailout” feature of electronic payments systems built into them. Shortly thereafter, as if on a cue, several U.S. lawmakers tried hurriedly to include a digital dollar in the bailout bill. That measure, and others since, have failed, but suddenly a “digital dollar” is very much on the policy agenda.     COVID-19, as unfortunate as the pandemic is, might have this one big positive, digital side effect.    Historically, one of the strongest policy arguments against a retail CBDC has been that banks are the primary instrument of credit and monetary policy. A CBDC available to households might undermine banks in a time of crisis. However, this crisis has shown the brick and mortar banking system is rather ineffective in serving its social purpose – which is to maintain financial stability and thus promote broader economic welfare.       U.K. Chancellor (finance minister) Rishi Sunak has struggled to deliver a bailout targeted at the little guy mainly because banks have failed to deliver the funds to the intended recipients. As the Guardian reported recently, only one in five U.K. businesses that have formally applied for government-backed loans have been granted emergency funding during the COVID-19 lockdown. Tragically, it appears the program may be too slow in getting money out fast enough to support struggling firms.       As we emerge from this lockdown in the next three to six months, it will be interesting to see if this inability of banks to bail out the little guy (or girl) will impose a direct political cost on politicians like Mr. Sunak and Mr. Johnson. If it does, one hopes that even opponents of retail CBDCs will give the idea strong consideration. Retail CBDCs always made sense and now the COVID crisis and the need to get people money quickly and directly has proved the case.     4. Market infrastructure will integrate magic money    Historically, cryptocurrency regulation around the world has been characterized by an inconsistent patchwork of reactive, state by state and country by country rules. For an industry built around an asset class that is designed for instant, global, internet-based transfer, this has been a minefield to navigate. In Western Europe, where most nations are now transposing the fifth money laundering directive (5MLD) into law, licensing and registration requirements are coming into force in a country-by-country manner. For example, Spain doesn’t yet formally regulate cryptocurrencies, whereas Germany now formally characterizes cryptocurrencies as a financial instrument indicating the European Union’s MiFID rules might govern cryptocurrency markets sooner rather than later.       See also: Ajit Tripathi - 4 Reasons Central Banks Should Launch Retail Digital Currencies      Then there are a number of minor and major country by country variations that require at least a PhD in Twitter law to navigate fully. This lack of regulatory harmonization might create interesting opportunities for some but it hurts the crypto industry as a whole by making it nearly impossible for innovators to scale crypto businesses globally. By bringing bitcoin and crypto assets firmly and positively into the policy and regulatory discourse, COVID-19 will sharply accelerate this drip feed of inconsistent regulation towards harmonized and integrated fiat and crypto markets.       Some experts like Caitlin Long, who has led the charge in Wyoming to create a favorable environment for the crypto industry, believe such a shift will bring more institutional money into crypto. I feel that while an institutional wall of money will benefit our industry, what’s more important is that the road to cross-border, peer-to-peer electronic money might now have become shorter. And COVID-19, as unfortunate as the pandemic is, might have this one big positive, digital side effect.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Ajit Tripathi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/05/4-ways-covid-19-will-bring-banks-and-regulators-to-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8a563cbc3a4697311ee63c64013ba6c80a1ae7e-1256x1024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404605,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdj4jI,1588681943,Mysterious Company Files New Lawsuit Over Ripple's $1.1B XRP Sale,"A little-known Puerto Rico-based company has gone after Ripple in court, accusing the blockchain firm of running an unregistered securities sale of the XRP cryptocurrency.      The company, Bitcoin Manipulation Abatement (BMA), filed a lawsuit Friday in San Francisco, alleging both Ripple and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, had violated federal and Californian laws on seven counts when hosting its $1.1 billion XRP sale.      BMA accuses Ripple of publicly promoted the sale to investors to drive up demand and maximize profits, without registering the sale with the relevant regulator. It also claims the company purposefully misled investors with false announcements to ""artificially inflate the price at which they can sell XRP.""      The plaintiff adds that XRP had no utility at the time of the first sale in 2013, with its sole value coming from being a speculative investment, and that the $1.1 billion Ripple made from the token sale was more than the rest of the company's combined revenue and cash flow.      See also: Ripple Engineers Publish Design for Private Transactions on XRP Ledger      Very little is known about BMA. The company was incorporated in Puerto Rico in March 2019 and has one sole director, Pavel Pogodin, named on the corporation registry. It first made headlines after filing a suit against FTX in November, accusing the derivatives exchange of manipulating the price of bitcoin. The case was thrown out in mid-December.      BMA appears to represent Pogodin. The filing says he had purchased XRP from Ripple but lost money from relying on Ripple's ""misrepresentations"" that the ""adoption of XRP by financial institutions and banks would drive demand for XRP.""      As well as requesting Ripple return all money made in the illegal sale, BMA is also asking the court to award ""compensatory damages.""      CoinDesk reached out to Ripple for comment but had not received a reply by press time.

42404621,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdj4w5,1588678926,"First Mover: Amid Economic Meltdown, Bitcoin Is Winning as 'No Value' Buffett Eats Crow","Billionaire investor Warren Buffett says he's having a hard time finding attractive investments as the coronavirus ravages the global economy.      Maybe he should take advice from professional crypto investors like Pantera Capital's Dan Morehead – and reconsider bitcoin.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency the 89-year-old Buffett described in February as having ""no value,"" is up 23% this year to about $8,870. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, which Buffett routinely endorses for amateur investors, is down 12%. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett's insurance-to-utilities conglomerate and investment vehicle, are down 21% in 2020.      Morehead, a former Goldman Sachs mortgage-bond trader who later oversaw foreign-exchange options at Deutsche Bank in London and headed macro trading at the renowned hedge fund Tiger Management, started Pantera in 2013 as a bitcoin investment firm.      In a monthly letter last week, he echoed Buffett's sentiment that there's little visibility right now on the global outlook: ""This is a really distressing, massively confusing time,"" Morehead wrote.      What's clear already, according to Morehead, is the pandemic's devastating toll on the economy and the likelihood things won't get much better anytime soon. That means big government deficits are coming, accompanied by unbounded money printing.      All that bodes well for bitcoin, according to Morehead – especially with the additional kicker coming next week from its underlying blockchain's quadrennial ""halving,"" where the pace of new supply gets cut in half. Bitcoin is seen by many crypto investors as a bulwark against inflation.      ""Like hydrostatic pressure, that flood of new money will float all boats,"" Morehead wrote. ""I strongly believe it’s close to inevitable that this will be very positive for cryptocurrency prices.""      The economic gloom is pretty stark. According to The Wall Street Journal, a report due Friday from the U.S. government could show the unemployment rate rose to 16% in April, which would represent a record high in data going back to 1948. According to Politico, some estimates put the jobless rate rising to 22%, approaching the Great Depression high of 24.9%.      The U.S. Treasury Department said Monday it will borrow a record $3 trillion this quarter, a six-fold increase over first-quarter levels, to help fund coronavirus-related emergency spending.      Even Buffett warned, at his company's annual shareholder meeting on Saturday, of the potential ""extreme consequences"" of the Federal Reserve's moves to prop up corporate debt, according to CNBC.      “We’re doing things that we really don’t know the ultimate outcome to,” Buffett said.      According to The New York Times, Buffett is neither optimistic nor pessimistic, but ""realistic.""      These days, though, it's the crypto investors who seem more in touch with reality: ""Record monetary and fiscal stimulus"" are now driving the economy and markets, as Arca Funds, a cryptocurrency-focused investment firm, put it Monday in a newsletter. So far in 2020, the markets are on their side.      ""If your entire investment thesis for owning stocks and bonds requires this much intervention just to survive, shouldn't every debt and equity investor at least be willing to listen to alternative thought processes?"" Arca wrote.      To be fair, Buffett says he's looking to spend $30 billion to $50 billion on a special investment, so it might be hard to put that much into bitcoin without driving the price a lot higher; after all, the cryptocurrency's entire outstanding market value currently stands at about $163 billion.      Buffett told CNBC interviewer Becky Quick in February that he didn't own any cryptocurrency and ""never will.""      He might be missing the boat: There's a growing body of investors who see bitcoin as a promising investment for such depressing times. According to The Block, the Wall Street firm Jefferies recommended last week that investors buy bitcoin. And a newsletter sent Monday by the London-based crypto investment firm ID Theory included a chart showing how dramatically money managers turned last week in their bets on bitcoin futures:      Pantera's Morehead wrote in his letter last week that bitcoin prices could climb as high $115,000 by next year, a 13-fold increase over current levels. Buffett's shareholders might drool over such returns.      ""If you can find something that goes up in the biggest crisis in a century, you should have some of that in your portfolio,"" Morehead wrote. ""I think this is only the beginning.""      At the meeting on Saturday, Buffett ""left investors with a sliver of hope,"" according to The New York Times.      “The American miracle, the American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again,” he said.      Based on the prognostications of crypto investors who this year have proven more oracular than Buffett, that magic might come from entrepreneurs working to develop alternatives to the current financial and monetary system – and their inventions, including bitcoin.    Tweet of the Day  Bitcoin watch    Price: $8,885 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,112 | 24-Hr Low: $8,616      Trend: Bitcoin has again failed to keep gains above $9,000 and remains stuck in a six-day narrowing price range. The cryptocurrency is trading near $8,880 at press time, down 0.07% on the day, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      The analyst community remains optimistic about prospects of prices rising to $10,000 ahead of next Tuesday's mining reward halving.      However, the weekly MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend reversals, has crossed above zero, confirming a bullish reversal. That indicator, it's worth noting, is based on moving averages and tends to lag prices.      Bitcoin has already rallied by over 35% in the last two weeks. Further, it is up nearly 130% from the low of $3,867 reached on March 13. Such strong bullish moves are usually followed by corrections. The multiple rejections above $9,000 are indicative of buyer exhaustion.      As a result, a range breakdown on the 4-hour chart looks likely. That will likely cause some buyers to exit the market, leading to a deeper drop, perhaps to the 200-day average at $8,000.      If the range is breached to the higher side, it would imply a continuation of the rally from lows near $6,500 observed on April 16. Stronger evidence of bullish revival would be a violation of resistance around $9,250 – a trendline falling from the June 2019 and February 2020 highs. Bitcoin failed to absorb selling pressure around that resistance last week.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/05/first-mover-amid-economic-meltdown-bitcoin-is-winning-as-no-value-buffett-eats-crow,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fbc254f17062bce867a5bab531ca13ca528ab388-1500x1116.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404617,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdj4s9,1588677457,"Bitcoin Briefly Hits $9K, Investors Remain Bullish","Bitcoin (BTC) failed to plant a flag above $9,000 early on Tuesday, even as on-chain data suggests spiking investor interest in the top cryptocurrency by market value.      Prices rose to a high of $9,112 at 05:05 UTC, extending a recovery from Monday’s low of $8,528. At press time, the cryptocurrency had dropped back to near $8,850 on major exchanges, representing a 1.9% decline on the day, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      While the cryptocurrency found dip demand on Monday, the seven-day average of the number of unique addresses active on the network, as sender or receiver, rose to 932,274 – the highest level since June 29, 2019, according to the data provided by blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.      The non-price metric has risen by nearly 40% from lows observed in March and likely represents an influx of bitcoin investors, according to analysts.      “There is more media [attention] around the halving, which is causing more account openings; we're seeing that on the retail side too,” Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, told CoinDesk.      Bitcoin is set to undergo its third mining reward halving next Tuesday, following which the rewards per block mined will drop to 6.25 BTC from the current 12.5 BTC. The impending supply cut has been hailed as a long-term bullish development by many analysts.      See also: Bitcoin’s Halving Is Irrelevant for Some Large Traders      The hype surrounding the halving, coupled with the drop below $4,000 seen in mid-March, may have enticed existing investors to add more coins to their wallets and new investors to dip a toe in the cryptocurrency space. This is evidenced by the fact that unique active addresses began rising in the second half of March.      “We have observed a significant increase in ‘new money’ entering the ecosystem. Several exchanges and retail platforms are reporting a surge in Bitcoin deposits, new signups, and credit card purchases since the low that took place on March 13,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.      While the ecosystem looks to be expanding, each unique active address does not necessarily represent a single investor or user. A single person or an exchange can hold multiple addresses. Large investors, popularly known as whales, could buy, say, 10,000 bitcoins and hold them in many addresses.      Looking ahead, observers expect the number of active addresses to continue rising post-halving. “We'll see higher account openings at the end of May if we go through $10,000,” said Thomas.      If history is a guide, though, the cryptocurrency has potential to see a price pullback post-halving. It fell nearly 30% in the four weeks following its second halving on June 9, 2016.      Meanwhile, Dibb expects active addresses to reach levels seen during the height of the previous bull market in December 2017 on the back of continued retail demand and adoption by new entrants. The seven-day average of active addresses clocked a record high of 1,190,302 on Dec. 18, 2017, the day the cryptocurrency clocked a lifetime high of $20,000.      As far as the cryptocurrency’s price is concerned, volatility is expected to rise as we head into the halving.      “The push above $9,000 seen this morning is positive and could be the first indication that we have now started the run into the halving. Parts of Asia (Japan and China) were off today, but when they return tomorrow we will be just a week away from the halving so we can expect to see an increase in volatility,” said Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of the cryptocurrency platform Luno, earlier on Tuesday.

42404602,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdj4iJ,1588672800,"IBM, Mastercard Join Digital Identity Project Building 'Ecosystems of Trust'","The highly specialized world of digital identity is opening itself to a wider audience.      Announced Tuesday, the Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation is backed by governments, nonprofits and private-sector firms. Key players include Mastercard, IBM and the Canadian Province of British Columbia.      A vast ecosystem of public bodies and private companies, large and small, are working on establishing decentralized digital trust, using an array of technologies. The ToIP Foundation, which will live within the Linux Foundation, is a move to rein together core issues that matter to all of them, as well as creating appropriate technologies.      Read more: COVID-19 ‘Immunity Passport’ Unites 60 Firms on Self-Sovereign ID Project      Drummond Reed, chief trust officer at digital identity startup Evernym, said the ToIP Foundation is about defining something as fundamental as the transport layers of the internet itself. But in this case, the technology stack is specifically for establishing trust between people and organizations rather than just between machines, as is the case with internet protocol (IP).      “ToIP is able to address problems of establishing and maintaining trust between any two parties of any kind anywhere on the internet,” said Reed.      John Jordan, executive director of British Columbia’s digital transformation arm, coined the term “Trust over IP” – a play on the “Voice over IP” technology that powers modern-day telecommunications.      Jordan, who has been working closely with the Hyperledger blockchain arm of the Linux Foundation, says the story of ToIP “isn’t really a technology story.”      “This is a story about how we help organizations, governments and people make good decisions about using technology to establish and build trustworthy relationships over the internet,” he said in an interview.      Founding Steering members include Accenture, BrightHive, Cloudocracy, Continuum Loop, CULedger, Dhiway, esatus, Evernym, Finicity, Futurewei Technologies, IBM Security, IdRamp, Lumedic, Mastercard, MITRE, the Province of British Columbia and SICPA. Contributing members include DIDx, GLEIF, The Human Colossus Foundation, iRespond, kiva.org, Marist College, Northern Block, R3, Secours.io, TNO and University of Arkansas.    Key issues    For Jordan, the two core governance concerns of ToIP will be ensuring a privacy-enhancing and peer-to-peer architecture.      “Not client-server,” he said. “P2P is a respectful equal footing for both sides of the equation. As soon as we have an intermediary, our ability to evaluate the overall trust of that relationship is confounded. We also want to see that those interactions can be done in a way that is private.”      Read more: Vinay Gupta’s Big Idea: An Identity Layer for Your Things      While governments like British Columbia can offer a natural cornerstone of trust to issue so-called “verifiable credentials,” the ToIP Foundation includes many trust-issuing starting points across finance, healthcare and education, said Reed.      “There has been a lot of interest regarding COVID-19-related situations, both health and back to work,” he said. “There are also several universities involved, looking at digital credentials in education which is just a huge area; it’s a whole industry.”    Giant partners    Mastercard has been deeply involved in work on digital identity, approaching it with a wide lens, not just on financial services, but also looking toward the delivery of digital health, education and government services.      Mastercard’s approach to digital identity is predicated upon a user-centric, distributed model, said Charles Walton, Mastercard’s senior vice president of digital identity. ""Personal information sits with its rightful owner, you. It boils down to: I own my identity and I control my identity data,"" he said.      This cannot be accomplished in isolation, Walton added; Mastercard' s participation within the Trust over IP Foundation builds atop the groundwork currently in place to ensure industry standards.      Mastercard envisions a “collaborative digital ecosystem,” where “trust providers” can be organizations such as a bank, mobile network operator, university, or postal service that has a preexisting, trusted relationship with the user.      “Trust providers connect users to the ID service, enabling them to sign up, use, and manage their digital identity,” said Walton. “For financial institutions, by providing digital identity access with ID, they can extend and build an even deeper relationship in new ways. Also, if ID is embedded into a bank’s mobile application, they become a part of each interaction the user has with their digital identity. Across all areas of life -- financial, travel, health, education -- the bank’s brand can be a part of it, delivering even greater value and recognition.”      Read more: Money Reimagined: A World Where Privacy and Saving Lives Can Coexist      The need for standards was echoed by fellow ToIP member IBM.      “There is no ‘recipe book’ for the exchange of trusted data across multiple vendor solutions,” said Dan Gisolfi, CTO of the decentralized identity arm of IBM Security. “The new Trust over IP Foundation marks an evolutionary step which goes beyond standards, specs and code, with the goal of creating a community-driven playbook for establishing ‘ecosystems of trust.’”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/05/ibm-mastercard-join-digital-identity-project-building-ecosystems-of-trust,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4e0540c70e0d6e869fbc903d808372bda80dc929-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404611,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdj4oD,1588669200,IBM Teams With 3 European Power Grids to Build Green Energy Blockchain Platform,"IBM has created a blockchain consortium with three of Europe’s electricity grid operators to help smooth the transition to renewable sources of energy.      It’s an important step in the direction of decentralizing and democratizing the way power is consumed, which is essential if nations are to reach 2050 carbon-reduction goals.      The new Equigy platform is backed by TenneT, a grid provider covering Netherlands and part of Germany; Terna covering Italy; and Swissgrid covering Switzerland. Blockchain tech is employed as an accounting system so that consumers charging their electric vehicles (EV) or using home batteries can interact with the three transmission system operators (TSOs).      Read more: Why Tech-Minded Climate Groups See COVID-19 as a Trial Run for Massive Change      Stepping back, one of the challenges with renewable energy sources like wind or solar is that power production is no longer as predictable as it is with coal- or gas-fired plants, which can be ramped up at will.      The problem of green energy fluctuation can be addressed by consumers, many of whom are steadily shifting their transportation needs onto the electricity grid (oil is becoming a stranded asset in front of our very eyes). By opting to temporarily stop charging an EV, for instance, the efforts of individual users aggregated together can spare the grid megawatts of power.      A blockchain, in this case the Linux-affiliated Hyperledger Fabric protocol favored by Big Blue, operates as a trusted backbone to share charging data between consumers, aggregators and TSOs, which Equigy officials say will help create a unified system across borders.      “We can make the cause of the problem, which are all these renewable assets and people using EVs, also the solution,” said Leo Dijkstra of IBM’s Energy, Environment & Utilities unit. “If they can scale together then it’s possible to participate in the market for flexible power.”      Incremental change    For example, 100 EVs charging at 10 kilowatts equals a megawatt of flexible power, which is typically the smallest increment traded on flexible power markets, said Dijkstra. By aggregating the steadily growing number of EVs on the road, it becomes possible to equal the impact of big players in that market.      “The flexible power market is typically where large companies play, either with power plants or large industrial installations, not somewhere you and I can participate with our own assets,” said Dijkstra. “But we saw the blockchain as a means to make the system trusted and democratized, so that domestic appliances can participate and be trusted by the TSO.”      Read more: Hyperledger Conference Shows Where Blockchain Can Fight Global Warming      Irene Adamski, co-chair of the energy working group at the International Association of Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA), said the Equigy initiative showed lots of “promising signs,” and that something like this proposal has been brewing in the energy space for the past three years.      Having powerhouses such as TenneT, Swissgrid and Terna is sensible when seeking to solve energy transition challenges for all of Europe, said Adamski, formerly of the Energy Web Foundation and currently a blockchain adviser to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).      “Should the Equigy pilot project succeed, the heavily integrated area of Netherlands-Germany-Switzerland-Italy is an excellent jump-off point to expand across the continent,” she said. “The possible addition of Denmark, one of the countries with the largest amount of renewable energy in the mix, would make the entire thing rock solid.”    Electric cars    Electric-car makers are especially interested, said IBM’s Dijkstra, because consumers, by participating in such schemes, could see the total cost of EV ownership reduced.    Looking ahead, the next step is to enable EVs to discharge power into the grid. This will require cars and connection points to be enabled, but it's all on the roadmap, said Dijkstra, pointing to Equigy case studies involving BMWhttps://equigy.com/case/bmw-unlocks-renewable-energy-through-mobility/ and Nissanhttps://equigy.com/case/nissan-helps-empower-ev-owners-by-driving-v2g-efforts/.    Read more: GM, BMW Back Blockchain Data Sharing for Self-Driving Cars      Francisco Carranza, managing director of Nissan Energy, said he was pleased to see this platform rapidly scaling across Europe through the TSO collaboration of TenneT, Swissgrid and Terna.      “Most importantly, the system ensures that the electric vehicle owners are in full control and manage their energy storage or utilization. This enables balance of the grid efficiently and in the most profitable way,” he said in a statement.      The Equigy pilot, which is the fruit of a number of proofs-of-concept, will run until the end of the year.      Dijkstra explained that since TSOs are responsible for facilitating regulated processes, the consortium is initiated by Terna, Swissgrid and TenneT, whereas other firms such as carmakers cooperate as project partners.    Not so fast    The big challenge with all this is getting pioneering technology to integrate with legacy systems and architecture, as opposed to merely showcasing standalone proofs-of-concept, said Adamski.      In her role as co-chair of INATBA’s energy group, Adamski says incremental changes via sandboxes and blockchain projects are better suited to addressing the problem than a single, heavily funded attempt at an overhaul.      “From the DLT ecosystem perspective, it will also be interesting to see what technological approach they [Equigy] intend to take and which code base they plan to use,” she said.      Another essential piece of the puzzle is getting regulators to collaborate in the decentralization of the existing system.      “A lot of the proposed market roles, data exchange mechanisms and liability questions are so new that the existing legal frameworks do not cover them sufficiently,” Adamski said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/05/ibm-teams-with-3-european-power-grids-to-build-green-energy-blockchain-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1791a9e75b70d23c137feb9565b465257ce38c75-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The mining company has so far spent 311 billion rials ($7.3 million) on setting up the biggest mining operation in the country to date.      The ministry has also allowed the firm to begin offering cryptocurrency trading and custody from within the country, as per the report.      According to iMiner's website, the company is the ""first and largest bitcoin mining and extraction system in Iran"" currently with 2,000 mining machines already hosted on its local site, with additional operations in Russia, Canada, Turkey and the U.S.      See also: Bitcoin in Emerging Markets: The Middle East      It comes at a time when interest for bitcoin mining is building and low subsidized Iranian power rates attract investment from countries like China and France as well as an increasing price in bitcoin's market value.      Up until mid-2019, the state sought to crack down on mining operations out of fear of cryptocurrency's potential ability to undermine the national fiat currency, even threatening jail time for infractions.      However, Iran's cabinet had a change of heart last July and introduced legislation making crypto mining an official industrial activity. Since then, the mining ministry has been actively regulating the space, reportedly issuing around 1,000 licenses to local operations in January.      See also: How Bitcoin’s Price Slump Is Changing the Geography of Mining      The expansion of crypto mining operations can also be viewed as an attempt to circumvent U.S. sanctions that have been hurting the country's economy since long before U.S. President Donald Trump came to power.

42404599,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdj4fM,1588653589,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Nears All-Time High in Final Adjustment Before Halving,"Bitcoin mining difficulty – a measure of how hard it is to compete for block rewards – has neared an all-time high in the network’s last adjustment before the halving happens in roughly seven days.      The world’s largest blockchain network by market capitalization just adjusted its mining difficulty to 16.10 trillion (T) at 4:05 UTC on Tuesday, close to the network’s all-time high of 16.55T recorded in March.      Tuesday’s upward surge follows the second-largest decline in the network’s history in late March.      Read more: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Posts Second-Biggest Percentage Drop in Its History      Today’s adjustment, which is the second time mining difficulty has topped the 16T threshold, is also the final rate change before bitcoin’s halving – one of the most anticipated events in 2020.      Following the halving, which will reduce newly mined bitcoin in a day from 1,800 to 900 units, it is expected that the computing power connected to the Bitcoin network will subsequently drop.      Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Bitcoin’s mining difficulty is designed to adjust itself every 2016 blocks, or about two weeks, based on the competition in each adjustment cycle.      If there are more people participating in the game, the difficulty will go up in the next adjustment. If there’s less computing power, the difficulty will drop.      The difficulty adjustment follows a somewhat unusual bounty of bitcoin blocks mined late last week, when miners recorded 16 blocks in roughly an hour. As CoinDesk reported at the time, such rapid block production could have been a sign of the current difficulty level being too low.      Read more: Bitcoin Miners Usually Create 6 Blocks per Hour. They Just Banged Out 16      According to data from the mining pool PoolIn, the average hashing power connected to the Bitcoin network over the last seven days has jumped to over 119 exahashes per second (EH/s), with the last three-day average at an event higher point around 125 EH/s.      Meanwhile, the average computing power over the past two weeks is at 115 EH/s, just 1.4% higher than the previous cycle.      That would suggest the strong increase of the network’s computing power over the past week has helped the mining difficulty to post a growth, which would otherwise record a negative adjustment.      The computing power growth over the last week follows bitcoin’s price jump from $7,500 to around $9,000 in two days starting on April 29. The price rebound proved to be a savior for older mining rigs.      Read more: Older Mining Machines Turn Profitable Again as Bitcoin Rises Ahead of Halving      Following bitcoin’s dramatic sell-off on March 12, the network’s difficulty and hashing power both posted a 16% decline.
