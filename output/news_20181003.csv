42429742,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1ALh,1538596810,Abra Is Launching a Crypto Token Tied to an Investment Fund,"Crypto wallet provider Abra is launching a new token in a bid to offer investors more exposure to the cryptocurrency market.  The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Token (Bit10), developed with Bitwise Asset Management, tracks the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and is rebalanced monthly. Investors can purchase the token, which is built on bitcoin, to essentially invest in all 10 cryptocurrencies at once, according to a press release.  This grants retail investors access to ""nearly 80 percent of the cryptocurrency market"" at once, the release stated.  Abra CEO Bill Barhydt told CoinDesk that at present, the fund invests in bitcoin, ethereum, XRP, bitcoin cash, EOS, stellar, litecoin, dash, monero and zcash.  Users can deposit bitcoin, litecoin, bitcoin cash or a fiat currency into their Abra wallets and convert funds to the Bit10 token, he added.  The token itself is not a fund, he explained, adding:  ""The Bit10 token is 100 percent bitcoin based. It is a single bitcoin collateralized multi-sig wallet. The amount of bitcoin the consumer is holding in the Bit10 token's wallet is automatically adjusted to reflect the USD value of the Bit10 index. Abra is the counterparty to the contract and hedges away counterparty risk on all of its contracts. This is exactly how all of the other synthetic assets in Abra function.""  The token works by using smart contracts to peg a user's cryptocurrency or fiat currency holdings to Bit10. Bit10's price will, in turn, move with the performance of those coins.  While the token is built on Bitwise's index fund, it is not an exchange-traded fund (ETF), an Abra representative said. However, the token is similar to an ETF in its ability to grant investors exposure to an index.  That being said, Bitwise does intend to offer an ETF based on its cryptocurrency index fund, as previously reported. At the time, the company said it was looking for approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Because the Bit10 token is not an actual ETF, it does not require approval through the SEC, the Abra spokesperson told CoinDesk.  Barhydt explained that ""the Abra BIT10 token uses the same synthetic asset model as all of the other Abra tokens available in our app. The tokens are held in fully collateralized bitcoin multi sig wallets with the user holding their own keys. As such the BIT10 token is not a security.""

By using an immutable blockchain technology, the agency aims to verify the authenticity and provenance of messages, as well as avert fraud by preventing communications from being altered.  The ISA is quoted as saying that the integration provides an extra layer ""ensuring the credibility of the information relayed to the supervised bodies.""  Going forward, the ISA also aims to integrate blockchain in two other systems – an online shareholder voting platform developed by the ISA and a regulatory document archive called Magna.  Natan Hershkovitz, director of the agency's Information Systems Department, said:  ""Implementing blockchain technology in the ISA's information systems makes it one of the global leading authorities in securing the information provided to the public.""  While the regulator – like similar entities worldwide – is obviously sold on the benefits of blockchain, it has been more cautious when it comes to cryptocurrencies.  Back in March, the ISA banned companies that primarily hold, invest in or mine cryptocurrencies from listing on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Citing high volatility in the markets, the agency said it was protecting passive investors with the move, since their portfolios track the bourse's indices.  With Israel becoming something of a hotbed for crypto and blockchain startups, however, the regulator has seen fit to release guidance on what tokens it would class as securities.  Also announced in March, the ISA said at the time it would evaluate new tokens on a case-by-case basis, and that it would allow use cases such as utility and payments to be classified outside the securities box.

42381330,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94ZrD,1538581535,Bitcoin's Price Is Testing a Month-Long Trend Line,"Bitcoin bears have been emboldened by repeated rejection from a key moving average hurdle, but they may take a breather over the next 24 hours as the price heads for another key trend line of support.  The world's premier cryptocurrency is lacking a strong bullish or bearish bias in the near-term given that its price action has largely traded sideways since the beginning of September. That said, the repeated failure to find sustained acceptance above the 50-day moving average and $6,850 resistance gives the upper hand to bears, as it indicates that the path of least resistance is still to the downside.  Bulls might be ready to fight back, however, after bouncing off of a month-long ascending support trend line that has allowed prices to form a series of higher-lows.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,506 on Bitfinex, after having bounced off of the support trend line at $6,424 earlier today.  Daily chart  As seen above in the daily chart, any bullish momentum for BTC has been halted by the 50-day moving average and $6,850 resistance zone. It's worth noting the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is also nearing a bearish cross which may hint at more downside action to come.  However, the bearish MACD cross has yet to be confirmed. On top of that, bulls may be able to put up a fight by finding support on the ascending trend line that has been in effect since Sept 8th. Bitcoin's price has been able to form a higher low on the trend line three times in the past, so making a fourth is not out of the question.  Also of note: the compressing relative strength index (RSI) and narrowest Bollinger Band width since Dec. 2016 suggest price is overdue for volatility.  4-hour chart  Having failed to find acceptance above the 200 EMA on the 4-hour chart, again, confirms the path to the upside remains filled with obstacles.  That said, it is evident that bears have not yet gained full control since a near oversold 4-hr RSI – when combined with the ascending support – has allowed the price to form a series of higher lows.  Currently, in a stalemate, bears will look to extend losses to the previous higher low of $6,328 if price finds acceptance below the rising support.  View  Forming another higher low could return scope for the 50-day EMA located near $6,640  Daily acceptance below the rising support would set scope for a move to the previous higher-low of $6,328, which if violated would open the door for a move to next support of $6,100  A daily UTC close above $6,840 would put the bulls back in the driver's seat.

The question of crypto asset adoption was certainly on many of the attendees' minds, especially since Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the previous day that xRapid, the company's product the leverages the XRP cryptocurrency for ""on-demand liquidity"" in cross-border payments, is now being used in commercial payments by three companies.  At the time of the event, the combined value of all XRP in circulation was worth roughly $21 billion, with each asset trading for around $0.50. XRP previously traded at above $3.50 earlier in the year (at a $130 billion market capitalization) and at around $0.20 at the time of its inaugural Swell conference last year.  Representatives of two of the companies in question were on the panel: Brad Ganey, COO of Catalyst Corporate Federal Credit Union, and Nicolas Palacios, CFO of Cuallix. (The third company using xRapid commercially is MercuryFX.)  They were joined by Kwon Park, head of business development at Bittrex, a cryptocurrency exchange that has partnered with Ripple to facilitate the fiat-to-XRP transactions at the center of xRapid; and Alfredo O'Hagan, SVP of payment services at IDT, a telecoms firm that provides international payment services and has trialed xRapid in the past.  As might be expected from a group that uses cryptocurrencies in their businesses, the panelists were mostly enthusiastic about the adoption of digital, cryptographic assets in cross-border payments.  ""There's a big difference"" between xRapid and traditional systems such as SWIFT, said Palacios, in terms of ""cost efficiency, time efficiency, transparency"" and customer experience.  ""We see a lot of competitive advantage to this moving forward,"" Ganey said of xRapid, given that sending international wires is costly, time-consuming and ""not the cleanest process."" Rather than thinking of the service as a totally new or alien technology, he added, it may be better to describe it as ""a digital wire. It's a faster wire.""  Garlinghouse perhaps captured the unsatisfactory nature of the incumbent payment infrastructure on the first day of the conference, when he said that the fastest way to move money from Kuwait to San Francisco was to put cash in a suitcase and fly it there.  Replacing this system with crypto solutions isn't without its hurdles, however, as O'Hagan pointed out:  ""We are regulated entities so we have to make sure all the pieces are in place.""  The process of ""education"" – an oft-repeated word on the panel – doesn't only involve regulators, however, but internal risk management and compliance personnel, as well as banking partners.  ""The corporate risk committee had to be convinced,"" said O'Hagan, continuing, ""The first time we mentioned, cryptocurrency we got this"" (he imitated a loud, exasperated sigh). IDT, he said, has seen up to a quarter of its international payment flows completed in cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, litecoin and ""whatever is best in that particular market"" in terms of the exchange rate.  Ganey, however, said that as far as regulators are concerned, ""to this point we've met with no resistance.""  An earlier panel provided some cause for optimism on the regulatory front. Michael Didiuk, partner at the Seattle-based law firm Perkins Coie, said that he did not believe the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – where he spent eight years – would consider XRP a security.  ""I think it's a currency,"" he said, though he added that a surprise decision to the contrary (for any cryptocurrency that the market is currently treating like a currency) ""is going to have ripple effects – no pun intended.""  Regulatory uncertainty and internal pushback are not the only barriers to mass cryptocurrency adoption in international payments, however. O'Hagan said: ""If you look at xRapid as a hub, you need the spokes, you need the entities that will enable that last mile […] The more companies that join in, the better we all are.""  In other words, part of what's holding back adoption is lack of adoption.  Ganey, however, did not appear to be worried about that, quipping in reference to other financial institutions:  ""I would be perfectly in favor of them staying on the sideline for a while.""

Representatives Doris Matsui and Brett Guthrie – both members of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittees on Communications and Technology and Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection – submitted the legislation Monday.  If passed and signed into law, bill H.R. 6913, dubbed the Blockchain Promotion Act of 2018, would create a working group to study the technology and create a common definition for the purposes of government.  Moreover, the group would go as far as proposing possible recommendations for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Federal Communications Commission to study how blockchain can be used by the administration.  Saying ""blockchain technology could transform the global digital economy,"" Matsui commented:  ""Opportunities to deploy blockchain technology ranges from greatly increased transparency, efficiencies and security in supply chains to more-opportunistically managing access to spectrum. This bipartisan bill will bring a broad group of stakeholders together to develop a common definition of blockchain, and, perhaps even more importantly, recommend opportunities to leverage the technology to promote new innovations.""  Her co-sponsor, Guthrie, added that blockchain ""can be a great resource for innovation and technology,"" noting, however, that the government first needs to establish how best to leverage the tech.  Like Matsui, he noted that it may play a role in an increasingly digital economy.  The two join other lawmakers in introducing legislation to promote blockchain. Last month, Congressman Tom Emmer introduced three bills of his own aimed at supporting development of the technology, though they focus more specifically on cryptocurrencies.

42381322,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Zjf,1538568055,"Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work Can Be Made More Efficient, IBM Research Claims","Proof-of-work (PoW), the consensus mechanism that secures bitcoin and numerous other cryptocurrency blockchains, has given the technology a reputation for hogging energy.  Indeed, a commonly advanced argument is that an army of specialized computers all racing to solve some arbitrary math problem can wind up using as much electricity as a small country.  However, scientists from IBM Research, the tech giant's R&D arm, claim to have found a way to reshape and combine blockchain architectures including PoW, arriving at what they call in a paper a ""sweet spot"" for energy efficiency, scalability and security.  Announced Wednesday, their discovery stems from applying PoW to a very different use case, the internet of things (IoT), and would run blockchain nodes inside the connected devices.  The problem they faced is that, unlike specialized PoW mining hardware for cryptocurrencies such as ASICs and GPUs, IoT devices vary widely in their computational power and energy resources. After all, IoT is a broad category that includes everything from pocket-sized temperature sensors to internet-connected automobiles.  As such, all or some of the devices in an IoT network might not be able to solve very complex PoW puzzles. Hence the impetus to make PoW energy-efficient, according to the IBM researchers' paper:  ""Efficiency in IoT can be defined as an optimal utilization of hardware resources and energy. Therefore, in order to achieve that, the IoT devices on the blockchain should optimally utilize resources and energy to maintain and progress the blockchain.""  Their proposed solution takes advantage of the fact that not all nodes on a network have to engage in mining. (Many dedicated bitcoin users, for example, simply run full nodes to check miners' work and keep them honest.)  Working on a testnet, or simulated blockchain environment, the IBM researchers have been dividing the nodes into small groups of 250 to 1,000 and then allowing an algorithm to decide what proportion of each group should be doing the mining work, depending on the amount of power used by each node and the security required. This, they say, gains optimum results in terms of conserving power while preserving security.  ""At the moment we look at blockchains like totally flat peer-to-peer systems, in which all the nodes have to do the same things, compete against each other to get that mining reward, for instance,"" Dr. Emanuele Ragnoli, technical lead at the IBM Research - Ireland, told CoinDesk. ""But you don't need everybody to do the same type of job.""  Ragnoli said he wanted to create a ""layered ecosystem"" in which different peers can do different things, thanks to clever algorithms which cluster nodes according to their capability and assign specific duties to them.  ""Some of the nodes do the full PoW, like you have in bitcoin,"" said Ragnoli. ""They do that because of the analytics behind the blockchain, which can actually see whether a device can do that kind of job, and place that device accordingly into a cluster of other devices that will be assigned a certain type of consensus.""  The ""sub-blockchains"" maintained by these node groups are then connected using interoperability technologies such as Cosmos and Polkadot. In a nod to this patchwork, the IBM Research team has dubbed its lab project ""Hybrid IoT Blockchain.""  Machine economy  Stepping back, the IBM Research work is part of a broader push to create a future machine-to-machine economy, in which devices would have their own blockchain wallets and trade with each other (picture one self-driving car paying another for the right of way).  But Ragnoli is realistic about the scale of the IoT challenge for blockchains, saying this world is still a ""huge set of leaps"" away.  Attempting to take on a bite-sized chunk, his team investigated how a machine-to-machine ecosystem might work in an industrial setting, connecting cutting-edge manufacturing activities between a number of factories in the Netherlands. (IBM wouldn't identify the enterprises involved but said there is a consortium on the horizon.)  ""Nowadays in industry 4.0, or manufacturing, you have many different factories that collaborate with each other to create a single product,"" Ragnoli said. ""So you have sensors, machines, even algorithms and analytics operating in the different factories, and inside the same factory, that the need to interoperate with each other.""  From linking these factory devices together with the hybrid model, IBM found that arranging nodes in clusters of about 250, with 7% of those sub-blockchains doing PoW, achieved the best in terms of scaling, without sacrificing the hard-won security associated with PoW.  ""We are taking common consensus algorithms like PoW, the vision of Cosmos, etc., and we are altering ways of putting them together. The way we are designing this is like small Lego blocks, driven by the AI layer,"" said Ragnoli.  AI and blockchain  The IBM Research project is notable because it suggests that the deterministic requirements of blockchains can be combined with the black box of AI, allowing machine learning algorithms to alter the shape of blockchains to adapt to power or latency limitations, without compromising security.  As such, this would seem to open the door to a whole new design space.  ""Why not augment the blockchain with analytics and AI algorithms that can actually shape the blockchain in a way that it helps it to overcome some of the limitations that are out there now?"" said Ragnoli.  In the case of IoT, the way this works is the AI receives as an input the IoT devices that are on the system and the available resources of those devices. It also assesses the overall security requirements of the system and decides which and how many devices are mining, the PoW difficulty, the block generation rate, the block size and tries to balance between required security and scalability.  Therefore, IoT devices can still perform their application-specific tasks, such as data processing, and concurrently continue to mine blocks.  So how could this work impact the world of cryptocurrencies? Merely saying that PoW just needs to be better organized is like saying the free market could be more efficient.  Ragnoli said there could be a possibility to alter the way trading systems work in a dynamic way with different currencies, adding,  ""I've not gone as deep as actually altering the cryptographic consensus within – although that is actually a very interesting direction to explore.""

42381325,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Zoh,1538564407,Coinbase Rolls Out System to Free Up Stuck Bitcoin Payments,"With transaction fees ""volatile and unpredictable,"" sending cryptocurrencies can sometimes be frustrating.  So says U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase in a new blog post that sets out the issues rising from shifting miner fees, and exactly what it has been doing to address the problem.  As most who have sent or received bitcoin will know, the primary problem is that the fee variations can mean significant changes in the amount of time it takes for transactions to be confirmed. Coinbase says this wastes company time in pointless support requests and provides users with a ""frustrating experience.""  The reason fees rise and fall so readily is that rather than clawing back transaction costs via a percentage – as card firms like Visa and Mastercard do – bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies pay miners a fee to confirm transactions. And that's based on a model not dissimilar to bidding at an auction.  At times when the bitcoin network is busiest, miners have a queue of transactions to process and these are prioritized by dealing with the transactions offering the highest fee first.  But the method can cause lengthy delays before transactions are confirmed and the funds have ""arrived."" It can also cause spiking fees at the busiest times, as was seen in late 2017 when the price shot up to an all-time high of around $20,000.  To address the issue, Coinbase says it has turned to a procedure which uses economic incentives built into the bitcoin protocol for improving confirmation time of transactions.  ""Child Pays for Parent"" (CPFP), as it is called, has been rolled out at across the company' systems in the last few months.  CPFP works by following up a stalled bitcoin transaction (with a fee too low for the current market to want to process immediately) with a so called ""child"" transaction – a later transaction linked to the original ""parent"" transaction, and in this case, set to offer a higher fee.  Since bitcoin mining clients will often batch a group of transactions, adding a better-rewarding child transaction can cause the parent to be processed sooner, the post indicates.  Coinbase says that the process kicks in after a payment has been stuck for ""at least 4 blocks"" and has at times been used to automatically ""rescue thousands of transactions in a single day.""  The exchange adds that CPFP is carried out without the need for interaction from the customer and the results have been ""really positive"" so far.

42381324,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94ZnR,1538557245,IBM Wins Patent for Blockchain-Based Network Security System,"A new patent awarded to tech giant IBM highlights how blockchain tech might play a role in monitoring security breaches within computer networks.  First filed in September 2017 and awarded Tuesday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the patent outlines how a network of monitors connected to a blockchain platform can log events on the network, including potential intrusions. While attackers may try to hide signs of their work on one monitor, having multiple backups of that information will help ensure that such events are still logged, according to IBM.  ""On a computer system or network, data may be monitored for many different purposes. Data monitoring may identify problems, observe conditions or track metrics by logging the events of a given computer system or network,"" the patent states. Securing such data is critical for a company.  To that end, Big Blue notes that companies may set up a system of devices to monitor attempted intrusions on the distributed network, using node consensus to flag any irregularities.  The patent explains:  ""Having synchronized monitors set up in a blockchain configuration ensures consensus among the monitors. Since one monitor alone cannot alter the event log in the past or cannot fake the event log in the future, if one monitor is hacked, then there may be no consensus among the synchronized monitors and the event may not get written into the log.""  The sensors allow consensus by passing the same information to more than one monitor. When monitors are validating information, if data for an event or transaction does not match, then one monitor may have been compromised.  In such an event, this ""may alert the monitor security program of inconsistent data,"" which in turn warns the system administrators that there is an issue.  Using blockchain technology to highlight irregularities in this way, would therefore ""create a less vulnerable network"" according to IBM.

42381312,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94ZVp,1538553617,"Bitmain Is Going Public, But What Type of Investment Is It Anyway?","Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a newsletter for the institutional market, with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.      Last week, CoinDesk was first to give its readers a glimpse at the application documents of the much-anticipated initial public offering (IPO) of Bitmain, a mining chip manufacturer and one of the cryptocurrency sector's largest companies in terms of revenue.  What does this have to do with investing in cryptocurrencies, you may ask?  It signals the emergence of a new type of crypto investment – actual (*gasp*) shares in a listed company. Yes, a bet on the financials, operating strength and macro outlook of a business. But with a difference.  The difference is the exposure to cryptocurrencies. And here is where things get complicated.  Pure play?  Bitmain's cryptocurrency holdings account for 28 percent of its total assets. Does that make it effectively a soon-to-be-listed crypto fund, as some have suggested?  No. While cryptocurrencies have significant weight in the health of the business, the other assets (largely physical inventory and financial instruments) offer different types of risk and diversification.  What's more, the cryptocurrencies are valued at cost. They will not be revalued if the cryptocurrency price increases, so a bull market will not have a direct impact on the balance sheet. (It will, obviously, have a positive impact on sales of mining equipment and on profit from cryptocurrency sales.)  Nor will they necessarily be written down if the price falls. As the draft prospectus states, ""if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of cryptocurrencies may not be recoverable, an impairment loss may be recognized"" (my emphasis).  It's not clear how that carrying amount breaks down - the prospectus says that it's calculated using the weighted average of cost. Since over $700 million-worth of crypto entered the balance sheet in the second half of 2017, we can presume that the bulk of that was at prices higher than today's.  In the first half of 2018, Bitmain logged an ""impairment loss"" of over $100 million. Given that a large chunk of the crypto holdings is apparently in bitcoin cash, it's notable that the write-down wasn't larger.  There could well be more coming in the second half of the year, which will have a negative effect on the bottom line. But it's worth noting that, under the accounting principles Bitmain is using, an impairment loss can be reversed if market conditions change.  It's also worth noting that, in spite of the weak markets so far this year, Bitmain earned over $180 million of profit on cryptocurrency sales in the first half.  So, while the cryptocurrency markets largely determine the health of its business, Bitmain is not a pure cryptocurrency play. And, on top of market volatility, we have to add the additional risks of operational error, declining margins, supplier concentration, technology obsolescence, increasing competition and financial mismanagement.  Not to mention security – in 2017, Bitmain suffered the theft of almost $27 million-worth of cryptocurrencies. No details are given in the draft prospectus of its custody arrangements.  Something different  So what type of investment is Bitmain? A manufacturing company? A mining stock?  Just as we struggle to fit cryptocurrencies into the pre-established categories of financial instruments, it is hard to label Bitmain as well.  It is a business that makes a physical product. It also produces a virtual asset, and offers a service to others in the sector. Then, there's its exposure – direct and indirect – to the cryptocurrency markets. As the application recognizes: ""Our business and financial condition correlate closely with the market price of cryptocurrencies.""  Will its share price move in line with the price of bitcoin or bitcoin cash? We don't know.  That makes it not just a new type of crypto investment, but a new type of investment, period.  Values  Does this make Bitmain a good investment?  It does have a staggering historical revenue growth, and a dominant position in its sector. What's more, it is diversifying into artificial intelligence chip design, and spreading its geographical concentration.  But whether or not it is a good opportunity depends 1) on your market view, 2) your opinion of the management and assessment of the risks, and 3), even more important, on the IPO price. Fundamentals are crucial, obviously – but the key metric is perceived value.  As Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital Management put it: ""It's not what you buy, it's what you pay.""  Looking forward, the Bitmain IPO is especially encouraging in that it sets a benchmark for others to follow. It's not the only one in the pipeline – two more (Canaan and Ebang) have publicly expressed their intention to file for a listing, and we eagerly await a chance to see their financials. Others will no doubt follow, and not just from the mining segment.  This does much more than present investors with a wider range of crypto-focused assets to choose from. It also brings in even more participants from traditional finance (investors, analysts, investment bankers, even more lawyers), which, while possibly betraying crypto's ""alternative"" origins, narrows the gap between the two concepts and bestows even greater legitimacy on cryptocurrencies as a product.  Perhaps even more important is that both investors and entrepreneurs will be armed with a deeper well of information. Greater transparency and a better understanding of how the sector works should contribute to a more resilient infrastructure, which in turn will generate a greater variety of investment and financing opportunities. Whatever happens to the cryptocurrency markets, surely there is value in that.

42381326,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94ZmB,1538539246,"With Rambling Clinton Keynote, Ripple Is Sending a Clear Message","Former U.S. President Bill Clinton didn't have to say much when he delivered the keynote at Ripple's Swell conference in San Francisco. And indeed, he barely said anything relevant to the blockchain industry.  The 42nd commander in chief has long been recognized for his rhetorical prowess, but there was little pressure on him to rouse or inspire the audience at Ripple's event. He was sending a message on Ripple's behalf simply by appearing on stage.  Specifically, the company was saying: Ripple is the kind of company that can book Clinton to speak.  While Clinton and his wife – former U.S. Senator, Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton – have given talks at any number of venues over their decades of public service, the ""Paid Clinton Speech"" became something of a meme in 2016.  During the campaign, critics on the left and right balked at the $22 million Hillary had earned giving speeches to employees of big banks and other establishment boogeymen. The content of these speeches – she refused to release transcripts – became something of a national obsession. To some, they epitomized what was perceived as overly cozy relations between DC and Wall Street.  For a company like Ripple, then, there is powerful subtext in booking a Clinton to speak. To understand why, consider the ambiguity of the company's position.  Schrodinger's Ripple  Ripple is a Schrodinger's cat.  In one outcome, we open the box and a thriving fintech company emerges, one that provides a long-overdue efficiency boost to the financial services sector by introducing new, disruptive technologies: blockchain and digital assets.  In the other outcome, we open the box and Ripple is just another cryptocurrency company looking for a use case: the company sells tens of millions of dollars worth of the cryptocurrency XRP every quarter through a subsidiary, but as of today, just a few firms are making commercial use of the Ripple product that leverages XRP.  Meanwhile, Ripple has been taken to court by small-time investors who allege that its sales of XRP constitute an unregistered securities offering. Perhaps not coincidentally, Ripple has begun to assert that it did not create XRP – indeed, its ownership of the majority of the XRP tokens in existence is down to a ""gift"" from its creators.  Ripple is playing a high-stakes game, in other words, and it has clearly embarked on a campaign to cultivate the right relationships, project the right image and distance itself from the wrong sorts of crypto companies.  Making the right friends  The push is evident on multiple fronts.  Just a few days ago, it was reported that Ripple and others had created the Securing America's Internet of Value Coalition (SAIV), an advocacy group that will pay its DC lobbying firm partly in XRP.  Ripple's board, meanwhile, includes a former co-president of Morgan Stanley; a former superintendent of financial services for the state of New York, who created the state's cryptocurrency regulation; a former State Department official, who now runs a D.C.-Silicon Valley consulting firm with two former cabinet members and a former White House adviser; and an official who served in the Clinton and Obama administrations.  Former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke headlined last year's Swell conference, and day one of this year's conference included four current or former central bank officials – one of whom, Dilip Rao, is now Ripple's head of infrastructure innovation.  All of these associations with the rarified establishment of Wall Street and K Street are well and good. They reinforce what Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said onstage at Swell: for Ripple, ""it wasn't about replacing banks … there's an opportunity to be a builder and partner with the industry.""  Ripple's choice to book Bill Clinton to speak is entirely consistent with its lobbying efforts, its taste in board members and all the other ways in which it aims to project an image of respectability.  Not that kind of crypto  Still, the Clinton speech stands out as a particularly potent gesture.  Not only does it seemingly vault Ripple into a small circle of establishment firms that book Clintons: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank. It simultaneously distances Ripple even more emphatically from the world of fly-by-night ICOs, dark web markets, Ponzi schemes, tokens, sectarian hard forks and meat-only diets – the ""crypto"" scene that Ripple clearly wants nothing to do with.  Part of the 2016 saga, after all, was Wikileaks, an organization that began accepting bitcoin in 2011 and has generally been popular among cryptocurrency's more ideological devotees for its extreme anti-establishment and anti-censorship position.  The site published damaging excerpts of Hillary Clinton's speeches to banks in October 2016, just a month before the election.  In this context, the symbolism of a paying for a Clinton speech is clear: this organization has nothing to do with the sorts of cypherpunks and anarchocapitalists who donate bitcoin to Wikileaks.  Say anything  As for the content of Clinton's speech itself, that was unrelated to the real message.  As if to drive that point home, Clinton rambled: migrant children being separated from their parents, the lapsed assault weapons ban, the positives and negatives of identity politics, the Rwandan genocide, the movie ""Black Panther,"" the Israel-Palestine conflict and his new novel all got as much play as blockchain technology.  When Clinton did touch on the topic of the conference, it was only to say that money laundering was a risk, but that over-regulation risked stifling innovation. He also warned that toxic identity politics was a risk to blockchain somehow – as a last-minute, semi-coherent segue from the project of Hutu-Tutsi reconciliation following the horrific violence of 1994.  Ten years after the financial crisis and the publication of the bitcoin white paper, much of the bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency world is moving away from its anti-establishment roots.  But no one is doing it with quite as much panache as Ripple.
