42381422,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95jNt,1545345016,Bitcoin's Tick Problem (Getting Screwed on Crypto Exchanges),"Dan Cawrey is the CEO of Pactum Capital, a financial services firm focused on managing risk with cryptocurrency derivatives.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  Published writers say it. Powerful businesspeople say it. Elite athletes say it. Investors with a track record of smart decision-making say it; ""Consistency is the key to success.""  In cryptocurrency, many investors say bitcoin is a store of value, a digital version of gold. But bitcoin doesn’t behave like gold – offering a stable way to hold value long-term. Bitcoin often seems like a pretty inconsistent and manipulated market. For example, why does bitcoin trade at a penny tick size on most major cryptocurrency exchanges?  'Tick size' is a term meant to refer to the minimum quoting and trading amount available on an exchange. When bitcoin was worth a few dollars, a penny tick size made sense. When bitcoin was worth $100, penny ticks were reasonable.  At over $1,000, it creates problems. It disincentivizes standing orders while incentivizing volatility.  Imagine this scenario: Bitcoin is trading at $3,500.03. A human trader puts in a limit order to buy at $3,500.00. An automated trading system then “penny jumps” the human trader by putting in a small buy order at $3,500.01.  The systemized trader’s order will get filled first.  Automated cryptocurrency trading systems take comfort in these scenarios. This is because the orders of human traders need to get filled before they lose money. Therefore, systemized trades will always be one step ahead of any human with such small spreads. This happens constantly on cryptocurrency exchanges.  High-volume bitcoin traders are using systemization algorithms. The average trader is using manual or simple bot orders. These are not as easily adjustable on the fly to the whims of low tick sizes.  Bitcoin behaves unlike any other financial asset many have ever traded.  Most people buying financial assets try to get the highest quantity for the lowest price possible. Bitcoin is often the opposite, however. Traders try to buy the least amount possible at a higher price.  This is especially true with one penny ticks because of a combination of small order sizes and tiny spreads.  This Has Been Studied Before  In the foreign exchange market and equities markets, there is some precedent to changing tick sizes.  Forex markets, for example, decided to do an experiment: Lower overall tick size for currencies from what’s called a pip (0.0001) to decimal pip (0.00001).  The result? More high frequency traders with computerized algorithms “jumping” regular traders. This created uneven pricing, as basic bots and human traders simply don’t account for more decimals.  The SEC also did a review of this. They performed a tick size pilot involving small cap stocks. Results show increased depth, but decreased price quality. In addition, the depth increase appears to be related to large market orders. Crypto doesn’t entail millions of dollars in trades very often – that is executed in over-the-counter, not the spot market.  Imagine, for instance, that tick sizes for crypto were even lower than a penny. This would mean more opportunity for advanced HFT and less for retail traders. Conversely, having higher tick sizes would mean better trading advantages to average investors.  The larger the tick, the better for trading – which is obtaining highest quantity for the lowest price, as mentioned about. The smaller the tick, the worse pricing average traders/investors get.  A Call to Crypto Exchanges  Exchanges should take heed as changing tick sizes clearly isn’t a crazy idea. In fact, it’s something that should be experimented with given the nature of crypto as a new era in finance. Indeed, having a larger tick size in crypto isn’t unprecedented. CME, for example, lists bitcoin futures with a $5 tick size.  Adding inefficiencies to the market, sounds like existing banking, doesn’t it? Some may argue increased spreads are bad because it creates profit for middlemen who don’t actually do anything.  Actually, spreads in markets do serve a purpose. There is no specific rule on this per se. (Only the wisdom that optimal spreads should be as tight as possible). This means bids and asks should be close together while still attracting enough liquidity on either side of it to transact.  Still, it's clear that right now, one penny spreads in bitcoin do not attract enough liquidity to transact at the best bid and offer. There’s just a bunch of jumping going on, with orders placed and removed all the time. This is why small tick sizes are really hard to understand from a trading point of view.  Increasing bitcoin’s tick size from one penny to $0.50 or $1 would go a long way in leveling the playing field for human traders. It would also increase the cost for traders currently penny jumping and manipulating the overall price.  Pactum Capital focuses on cryptocurrency trading and market making. Our firm is sometimes several percentage points of daily volume on regulated U.S. exchanges. But, bitcoin’s tick sizes are continually perplexing to us.  So, why does bitcoin still trade with a penny tick size on most major exchanges?  It's a question we'd like to see answered in 2019.

42381404,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95j51,1545338016,US Lawmakers File Bill to Exempt Cryptocurrencies from Securities Laws,"Two members of the U.S. House of Representatives are seeking to exempt cryptocurrencies and certain other digital assets from federal securities laws.  The ""Token Taxonomy Act"" was introduced Thursday by Reps. Warren Davidson and Darren Soto, a move that comes months after a roundtable in Washington, D.C. that sought input about regulatory measures for the industry. According to the text, the bill – among other items – seeks to exclude ""digital tokens"" from being defined as securities, amending both the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  That definition has several components, all of which center around a degree of decentralization in which no one person or entity has control over an asset's development or operation. This ostensibly would clear the way for cryptocurrencies that don't have a central controller to be spared a securities designation.  The bill defines ""digital tokens"" as ""digital units created... in response to the verification or collection of proposed transactions"" (mining, basically) or ""as an initial allocation of digital units that will otherwise be created"" (as in a pre-mine). These tokens must be governed by ""rules for the digital unit's creation and supply that cannot be altered by a single person or group of persons under common control.""  Going deeper, a ""digital token,"" according to the text:  ""...has a transaction history that...is recorded in a distributed, digital ledger or digital data structure in which consensus is achieved through a mathematically verifiable process; and...after consensus is reached, cannot be materially altered by a single person or group of persons under common control;...is capable of being traded or transferred between persons without an intermediate custodian...""  And, perhaps most notably, under the bill's definition, a digital token ""is not a representation of a financial interest in a company, including an ownership or debt interest or revenue share.""  “This bill provides the certainty American markets need to compete with Singapore, Switzerland, and others who are aggressively growing their blockchain economies,"" Davidson said in a statement. ""To be certain, there will be other regulatory initiatives at some point, but this legislation is an essential first step to keeping this market alive in the United States.""  Other elements  The bill includes other crypto-friendly measures as well, including parts that focus on the tax implications of buying, selling or using cryptocurrencies.  For example, it mirrors language in a bill introduced in September 2017 that sought to create a de minimis exemption for purchases made with cryptocurrency. As noted at the time, because the U.S. Internal Revenue Service treats cryptocurrencies as a kind of property, transactions involving bitcoin, for example, trigger a capital-gains taxable event when spent, even in trivial amounts.  ""The amount of gain excluded from gross income under subsection (a) with respect to a sale or exchange of virtual currency shall not exceed $600,"" the new bill states.  Similarly, the bill seeks to make exchanges of one cryptocurrency for another tax-exempt and to create an additional exemption for individual retirement accounts (IRAs) alongside those that exist for gold bullion and other precious metal coins.  The Washington, D.C. industry advocacy group Coin Center celebrated the bill in a blog post on Thursday. ""We are happy to see continued action from Congress to implement common-sense clarifications and adjustments to the regulatory treatment of cryptocurrencies,"" wrote senior research fellow James Foust.  Looking ahead  The bill's submission caps an active year on Capitol Hill for discussion of cryptocurrencies, having seen a series of hearings in both chambers of Congress.  Thursday's proposals aside, the lawmakers suggested in statements that the bill seeks to lay the groundwork for further regulatory measures.  “While this legislation is a great first step, we are looking for feedback. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has a history of policing web services, while the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has authority over commodity derivatives,"" Rep. Soto said.  ""To what extent does the jurisdiction of the FTC apply to digital tokens?"" he continued. ""Can we address this issue in this legislation or will we need subsequent legislation to effectively regulate this emerging sector?""

McIngvale continued:  ""When performed in a way that's compliant with local law, these token offerings can help companies that are perhaps too mature for seed or crowd funding, but not quite ready to move into the VC world or look at an IPO, raise capital to get their projects moving. Working with Tokensoft it's our goal to give these teams a one-stop-shop - from compliance to audits, to storage and distribution.""  Coinbase launched Custody in May of this year, offering a crypto asset storage service for high net-worth investors or institutions with over $10 million in deposits. Coinbase Custody operates as a regulated trust company in New York State, offering compliant storage of digital assets.  Coinbase has also announced that it is expanding its coverage to six new European jurisdictions: Andorra, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Iceland, the Isle of Man and Lithuania.  Customers in those markets will have full access to Coinbase's retail service via its website and mobile apps for trading cryptocurrencies, the exchange said. It also plans to launch the Coinbase Pro and Prime services in those regions in the future.

42381403,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95j3l,1545327620,More Staff Cuts Are Coming at Ethereum Studio ConsenSys,"Ethereum venture studio ConsenSys is spinning out or cutting off funding for a number of its portfolio startups, or ""spokes"" in company parlance, three sources with knowledge of the situation tell CoinDesk.  According to a report published Thursday by The Verge, roughly 50 percent of ConsenSys’ 1,200-person workforce could be let go as a result of the move. CoinDesk was not able to independently confirm that figure, but multiple sources have said additional staff cuts are impending.  Thursday's news follows the announcement earlier this month of roughly 150 layoffs, or 13 percent of the company's staff. CoinDesk reported last week that more cuts were likely, citing current and former employees.  One source told CoinDesk that ConsenSys is presenting some of its spokes with an option to discontinue work with a severance package or seek outside investment. The company has declined to answer questions about how the spokes will be jettisoned, but following the publication of this article provided the following statement to CoinDesk:  ""As part of the evaluation promised with our transition to ConsenSys 2.0, our Labs team is engaging in ongoing conversations with every project, and in some instances, has provided options for them to determine their path forward. Next steps differ, with spokes having autonomy to decide about their own staffing.""  It's perhaps the most dramatic development at ConsenSys since founder Joe Lubin first announced his updated vision for the company late last month.  Whereas previously “it was good enough to do cool projects,” Lubin told CoinDesk earlier this month, ConsenSys 2.0 will be different: “We are going to focus much more rigorously across the different business lines on accountability, that includes financial sustainability.""  The decentralized company has grown rapidly, with a major hub in Brooklyn and outposts spanning the globe. A recent profile published by Forbes estimated the company’s annual burn rate at over $100 million.  ""At best this is just ordinary course fat trimming given the company grew its workforce by at least 300% in the past year to 1,200 people,"" said investor Jeanna Liu in a comment published by Quartz. ""At worst this could indicate internal disorg and poor currency risk hedging (ie not converting sufficient ether to fiat). Let’s hope it’s the former.""  Updated with comments from ConsenSys.

42381415,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95jHb,1545321621,Token Startup Templum Seeks SEC Clarity on Post-Trade Activities,"Regulated token trader Templum wants to clarify how digital assets tracked or tokenized on a blockchain might fit within U.S. securities regulations.  To that end, the company filed a rulemaking petition to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week, in which the firm outlined how crypto assets and blockchain technology may be leveraged in certain forms of securities transactions.  The company is asking for clarity on how these nascent technologies fit into current regulatory schemes, said Templum co-founder and CEO Vince Molinari. ""It doesn't really exist in its current framework, at least in our opinion,"" he told CoinDesk.  The petition largely looks at the market infrastructure for digital assets, some of which may be unregistered securities.  ""We encourage the SEC to provide needed guidance related to post-trade activities in the digital asset space,"" the petition reads.  Specifically, Templum is looking to the SEC to explain when a blockchain platform must register as a clearing corporation or how a clearing corporation might use blockchain, and when a blockchain platform must register as a transfer agent or tell digital asset issuers when they must use a transfer agent. It also seeks to know when the SEC might modernize existing custody and customer protection rules to allow for blockchains used to track securities transactions.  Further clarity is needed around the different types of information stored on a blockchain. Digital assets might simply be recorded on the ledger, or they may be tokenized, Molinari said. Other questions relate to custody rules, and how they may apply.  Templum's petition was submitted as a part of the company's advocacy work in the blockchain space, Molinari added. In particular, he sees digital assets moving to blockchain platforms, and soon, saying:  ""I don’t think this is a five-year off strategy, I think as 2018 became the [year] of the security tokens, I think 2019 is going to surprise a lot of folks in the acceptance and [use] of digital assets.""  The migration of securities – particularly unregistered ones – to digital securities platforms could happen over the next six to 18 months, he predicted.  ""We're not creating an entirely new industry, it exists today. We recognize that these are securities, [and now] we're talking about the private placement marketplace,"" he explained.

The firm announced Tuesday that Substrate is now available as a beta version, adding that the open-source tech was designed to be ""as generic as possible"" to allow flexibility when designing blockchains. The included API also lets users create their own consensus mechanism or they can utilize ""most"" existing algorithms.  Substrate is integrated with the firm’s blockchain interoperability protocol Polkadot and is written in the programming language Rust, while a JavaScript implementation can run in web browsers.  Ethereum co-founder and Parity Technologies founder Gavin Wood said:  “Substrate takes all of our lessons learned in building Ethereum and Polkadot and distills that down into a stack of tooling that allows you to get all of those same rewards.”  Substrate is currently licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPLv3), Parity said, but it is planning to move to the Apache 2.0 open-source license for “maximum developer freedom.” Apache 2.0's ""widely permissive nature"" will also encourage Fortune 500 companies to adopt the technology, the firm said.  With Substrate, said Wood, ""you don’t have to know everything, you don’t have to do everything to develop your whole new blockchain, but you can do just enough that you do have a domain-specific chain, that has its own parameterization, and its own features that allow you to get a particular job done.""  Parity first revealed the pending release of Substrate back in October at the Web3 Summit in Berlin. The firm also added an early version of ethereum’s Casper code change to Substrate in the same month. The code contains a mechanism to transition to the “Shasper” upgrade, which combines ethereum’s in-house scaling solution, sharding, alongside its proof-of-stake consensus switch, Casper.

Other investors in the round include Digital Currency Group, institutional investor Jeffrey Tarrant and more.  Layer1 is a crypto investment and engineering infrastructure platform. However, it also acts as a kind of tech-focused fund in that it backs “promising” blockchain protocols and then builds technology to support their growth. The firm takes a particular focus on ""programmable money and store-of-value applications,"" which it sees as having the most potential for value creation.  Layer1’s co-founder Alexander Liegl said:  “Cryptocurrencies, as open-source protocols, offer the unprecedented opportunity for companies ... to meaningfully add value. This is fundamentally different from the possibilities available in traditional asset classes.""  Currently, the firm said it's ""deeply involved"" with a privacy-focused cryptocurrency called grin, which is scheduled to launch on Jan. 15, 2019. According to an activehttps://jobs.lever.co/layer1/7924c33a-c641-4b88-839d-b3b2c2e3e741 job post, Layer1 may also be planning to mine grin and other cryptos.

42381402,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95j1F,1545310538,Tensions Emerge Between Hyperledger Blockchain Group's Biggest Supporters,"When the governing board of Hyperledger approved a new supply chain project earlier this month, it marked a significant departure for the open-source blockchain consortium.  Sawtooth Supply Chain, as the project is provisionally called, breaks new ground because it’s arguably the consortium's first to really inhabit the application layer of the software stack. It's built on top of the Sawtooth framework, which Intel contributed to Hyperledger.  Prior to this, Hyperledger confined its work to the lower layers and eschewed the custom-design of blockchain application code with industry players in mind. That job was left to vendors to carry out in a proprietary manner – as IBM has been doing in its now-live food-tracking supply chain platform with the likes of Walmart.  Nevertheless, nine of the 11 Technical Steering Committee (TSC) members voted in favor of the new project on December 6. The approval of Sawtooth Supply Chain as a high-level project massively heightens its profile and means it enters Hyperledger’s formal project lifecycle and receives the support which goes along with that (community outreach, marketing, security review, etc.).  This happened over the objections of the other two members of the TSC, who questioned whether the project belonged within the scope of Hyperledger, CoinDesk has learned. Notably, both of them work at IBM: Arnaud Le Hors, who was absent from the vote, and Chris Ferris, the former TSC chair, who was present but abstained.  From the sidelines of the enterprise blockchain world, it looks like a tug-of-war has broken out, with IBM and its favored Hyperledger implementation, known as Fabric, on the one side, and the Intel-backed Sawtooth on the other. The latter team also has a budding champion in the form of newly appointed TSC chair, and Sawtooth lead maintainer, Dan Middleton of Intel.  As well as doing engineering further up the stack at the application layer, Sawtooth Supply Chain is the first project sponsored by a non-tech company, U.S. food giant Cargill. As such, the supply chain project, which has yet to be given a permanent name, will likely speed toward faster deployment than its Hyperledger peers. And given Cargill's involvement, it is a prospective rival to IBM's Food Trust.  However, the stakes are higher than a potential competition between supply chain-focused platforms coming out of Hyperledger, as the tensions point to bigger questions around governance.  While IBM argues that putting Hyperledger's imprimatur on an app-level project could undermine the consortium's position as a neutral player, others characterized the tech giant's resistance to the proposal as an attempt to stifle competition.  “This is fundamentally a discussion about what is open source software,” said James Mitchell, CEO of Bitwise, which wrote the bulk of Sawtooth 1.0 code and is contributing to the supply chain project. “And is the structure of an organization like Hyperledger ultimately to be protectionist around a set of commercial interests, or does it have a different set of goals?”  'Paying rent'  One way to look at the tensions over the supply chain project is as a sign of Hyperledger growing past its origins as an IBM-dominated organization.  Choosing his words carefully, TSC chair Middleton told CoinDesk that part of his job is to ensure diversity within Hyperledger and to retain those strengths from which blockchain gains its preeminence.  He acknowledged that IBM has been a big contributor to Hyperledger and to the open source effort, as have Intel and a lot of other organizations.  “I think it's important that no one of those organizations undermines the legitimacy of having an open source organization where we are all developing code transparently. We just want to make sure that we have a good balance among all the contributors,” said Middleton.  Mitchell of Bitwise was less diplomatic, claiming that IBM, with its early proliferation of Fabric, has used Hyperledger (and the consortium's affiliation with the Linux Foundation) as a way to market its services to enterprises – what he called “open-source washing.""  “You want to be able to tell a story about how you are building open source solutions. But where it matters, which is the bulk of the application code, you want to be able to retain proprietary ownership of intellectual property and be able to monetize the solution at that level,” Mitchell said of IBM’s blockchain strategy to date.  “I think people are savvy to this; they realize they don’t want to be paying rent to a large technology provider for the next two decades on these solutions,” he added.  Michell warned that blockchain may represent an even more aggressive form of lock-in than previous enterprise software licensing, once an industry adopts a particular lingua franca of how business is transacted.  “Based on conversations we have had with industry partners we are working with, like Cargill and others, we strongly believe industry needs to own those solutions,” rather than the vendors, said Mitchell.  This could take the form of closed-source, shared ownership amongst those parties, he said, or, better yet, open source software that those industries are building, contributing to and sharing.  Real or fabricated?  In expressing his concerns about widening the scope of Hyperledger to promote the Sawtooth supply chain project, IBM’s Ferris said this was his personal view and not an IBM-related matter.  He told CoinDesk:  “When we set up Hyperledger initially, we said we would not go into the application space. And we did that for a reason, because we want people to take the frameworks we are building and leverage them. We didn't want to be perceived somehow as competition to someone who is legitimately trying to build a solution around supply chain.”  Ferris added that the components being built in the new supply chain project are “pretty specific” to Sawtooth right now. That concerned him because, according to Hyperledger Governing Board guidance, top-level tools projects also need to be seen to support multiple frameworks rather than being overly focused on one.  Rather than be elevated to a top-level project, Sawtooth Supply Chain, in his opinion, should have been placed in Hyperledger Labs. This is where projects deemed too early for TSC approval for incubation, such as sample code from hackathons or research projects, are placed. If a Labs project wants to enter incubation and become a formal project, a project proposal must be submitted for TSC consideration.  Regarding Middleton's point about the need for greater diversity within Hyperledger, Ferris said this has been addressed, particularly over the last year or so, as many developers from a range of organizations have joined the community. IBM now accounts for maybe 30 percent of the total contributions, he said.  “In Fabric, we are about 40 percent of that total. I mean, it used to be 100 percent. So the number is constantly coming down. Yes, IBM is very committed to the success of Hyperledger. But by the same token, we are also trying not to be overbearing in that investment, “ said Ferris.  Gari Singh, a distinguished engineer and blockchain CTO at IBM, added that while it can be flattering to hear how much IBM has done with Fabric, the lack of contributions from other big industry players is frustrating.  “So you look at Oracle running Fabric; Amazon and their new managed blockchain service actually takes the Fabric samples and uses it, but no contributions back. There are contributions coming but they are coming from the start-ups – we would actually like to see it from the big guys,” said Singh.  True Blue  Elsewhere at last week’s Hyperledger Forum in Basel, Switzerland, some important members of the community took the opportunity to show their respect to IBM.  Casey Kuhlman, CEO of Monax, said the fact that the Sawtooth Supply Chain project has been brought under the auspices of Hyperledger speaks for itself; despite misgivings, IBM ultimately did not stand in the project's way, he said, adding that in his opinion Big Blue has behaved like a “very reasonable member of the community.”  “Their actions have been, in my opinion, very reasonably self-serving,"" Kuhlman said. ""Because at the end of the day we are all businesses and we are all trying to make money. We are all self-interested. We should be.”  Hyperledger director Brian Behlendorf said that while evolution is happening within the organization, the focus is still going to be on things that can be generally applicable.  “It’s not going to be just to solving Cargill's needs for a reusable body of code or template or recipe or whatever for a large number of use cases,” said Behlendorf.  Speaking to the success of the first Hyperledger Global Forum, which saw hundreds of firms from across a wide range of industries descend on Basel for four days of talks and workshops, Behlendorf also wanted to pay due respect to IBM, concluding,  “We would absolutely not be here if it were not for them.”  Intel's Dan Middleton at the Hyperledger Global Forum image via Ian Allison for CoinDesk  Editor's Note: The headline for this story has been updated for clarity.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/20/tensions-emerge-between-hyperledger-blockchain-groups-biggest-supporters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a590bd8d3701ab87b21593fc927407973e0c503-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381413,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95jF5,1545307232,Bitcoin's Path to $5K Faces a Major Hurdle,"Bitcoin’s ongoing recovery rally faces a major obstacle that could impede progress towards $5,000, according to the technical charts.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped to a two-week high of $4,108 earlier today, validating the short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change confirmed earlier this week.  Notably, the break above the psychological hurdle of $4,000 looks sustainable, as 24-hour trading volume has jumped to one-month highs above $8 billion.  As a result, more bargain hunters could join the party, creating further upward pressure on prices. Even so, the rally may stall near $4,400 for some time, as the area around that psychological level is packed with key technical lines.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $4,040 on Bitstamp, representing an 8 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Daily Chart  The above chart shows:  The 50-day exponential moving average is located at $4,402.  The bearish lower price high of Nov. 29 is seen at $4,410.  $4,430 is the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from the Nov. 7 high to Dec. 15 low.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the hourly and 4-hour charts is now reporting overbought conditions, too.  All this combined, BTC will likely have a tough time scaling the stiff resistance zone of $4,400-$4,430 in a single attempt.  Moreover, a consolidation or a minor pullback from the current level of $4,040 will allow the RSI on the hourly and 4-hour chart to roll over from the overbought territory and realign in favor of the bulls. That, if confirmed, could ease BTC's progress across the resistance zone.  As a result, the move past that crucial resistance could yield a quick rally to the next psychological barrier of 5,000  View  Bitcoin may find it hard to beat the resistance zone of $4,400-$4,430 in short-term.  A high-volume daily close above $4,430 could be followed by a quick move higher to $5,000.  The prospects of a rally to $4,400 would drop if BTC falls back below Wednesday's high of $3,924.  A daily close below $3,633 would invalidate the bullish setup.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

A separate release giving specific numbers showed that the number of malicious crypto-miners grew nearly 55 percent in Q3 of 2018, with total malware growing 4,467 percent in the last four quarters.  “Many ransomware actors [are] switching to a more lucrative business model: cryptomining,” the report states.  In a growing trend, cybercriminals have begun focusing on leveraging internet of things (IoT) devices for crypto mining, McAfee said. New malware targeting these devices saw a 72 percent increase and total IoT-targeting malware grew by 203 percent in the last four quarters.  Remco Verhoef, security researcher at McAfee, said:  “We would not usually think of using routers or IoT devices such as IP cameras or videorecorders as cryptominers because their CPUs are not as powerful as those in desktop and laptop computers. However, due to the lack of proper security controls, cybercriminals can benefit from volume over CPU speed. If they can control thousands of devices that mine for a long time, they can still make money.”  Verhoef also said that McAfee discovered a Mac OS threat named OSX.Dummy, which is being distributed on cryptomining chat groups. The malware, posted online, suggests that users download software to fix ""crypto problems,"" after which it injects its malicious code. This way, users essentially infected their own devices, he explained.  Back in July, over a million computers in China were hacked to mine more than $2 million-worth of cryptocurrencies over two years. Another survey by software company Citrix showed that almost 60 percent U.K. businesses had been hit by cryptocurrency mining malware in August.

The cryptocurrency rose to a high of $4,067 at 09:06 UTC – a level last seen on Dec. 4 – according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Its market capitalization also hit a two-week high of $70 billion.  At press time, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $4,000 – up 28 percent from the 15-month low of $3,122 reached earlier this week.  The recovery rally was overdue as BTC had been looking extremely oversold as its value dropped by 50 percent over the last four weeks.  The bounce in the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is again boding well for the broader markets.  As of writing, names like ether, XRP, stellar and litecoin are all reporting 2 percent gains, as per CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin cash (ABC/SV combined) is up 30 percent and lesser-known cryptocurrencies like stratis and Chainlink have gained 45 percent and 27 percent, respectively, in the last 24 hours.  Meanwhile, the list of cryptos posting losses today includes maker and linkey, both of which are down 5 percent.  Bitcoin's move above $4,000 validates the bullish setup seen in the short-term technical charts. As a result, the focus now is on the next major resistance lined up at $4,400 (Dec. 29 high).

42381418,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95jLN,1545282013,A Middle Way Forward for Blockchain,"Henrik Hjelte is the co-founder and CEO of ChromaWay, a company focused on implementing blockchain solutions.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  Here in Stockholm, we've entered the long months of winter. In the next few weeks, the sun won’t rise until 9:00 a.m. and it will set just four hours later. Perhaps it’s some combination of our location and temperate climate which makes Swedes both innovative and practical.  We have a track record here on commercializing technologies (Stockholm is second only to Silicon Valley when it comes to the number of “unicorns” that it produces per capita). Companies like Spotify and Skype have combined cutting-edge technology with a practical approach to addressing consumer and business needs.  This in mind, there’s a Swedish concept called “Lagom,” which roughly translates into “Not too little. Not too much. Just right.”  Viewing blockchain through this Swedish lens, I see a useful design logic for how this technology can evolve to address many of the well-documented limitations of existing platforms and open up new (currently hard to predict) paths to solve pressing business and social challenges.  The internet ushered in a new era of businesses made possible only through networked technology. The leading companies in the world today, Google, Facebook, and Amazon, would not be possible without internet-based information exchange. The blockchain, some refer to it as Web 3.0, introduces a new layer that enables internet-based value exchange.  But, this leap forward is not a conversion exercise where enterprises simply re-write their code and move to an internet of value exchange. It’s more complicated than that, and success will require us to determine the best technology and business trade-offs to facilitate adoption and scalability without compromising security and trust.  As we are about to cross over into 2019, I offer these lagom-inspired approaches to resolving some of the thorniest problems facing greater blockchain adoption.  1. Function Versus Form  Dapps, applications that run on distributed blockchain data networks, have a number of problems currently.  User interfaces are quite crude and not easily navigable. Performance lags, no doubt due to the time it takes to validate transactions on the blockchain (a prospective passenger waiting in the rain on a New York street corner might have to wait at least 10 minutes for the transaction to be initiated on a bitcoin-based ride sharing dapp).  In addition, cryptographic keys will have to be managed by users who will likely view this as an unnecessary burden.  One impulse is to “wrap’ the dapp in a slick user interfaces thus hiding all of the decentralized, unique and value-adding aspects of blockchain. A better approach would be to introduce much improved design elements, but preserve features which make the blockchain most powerful. For example, instead of a pure custody model (See: Coinbase) for maintaining keys, utilize a multi-signature approach.  Instead of centralizing all of the client application operations (e.g., the algorithm which generates unique CryptoKitties), allow application logic to run on the blockchain. These are just a few, of the many, ideas to achieve better design balance for dapps.  2. Data Loaned Versus Data Owned  When I log onto LinkedIn, I am providing data that the company (actually Microsoft) now owns in exchange for my use of the application. Dapps offer a radically different data ownership model. The dapp user controls data access (through cryptographic signing), not the dapp developer.  This presents certain challenges and advantages for all parties. Developers have the complication of having to architect applications that utilize data validated by nodes operated by independent service providers.  Users will have to adjust to thinking of data as an asset they own and decide to “lend” to app developers. On the other hand, dapp developers can charge for use of the application and users are benefiting by paying for value-added features and functions and not to have their data sold to vendors.  3. Zero-Sum Versus Shared Benefits  The rage in the app economy is software-as-a-service pricing. Whether one is using a CRM tool like Salesforce or renting time on Amazon Web Services (AWS), it’s generally a zero-sum game for users. Unless I own shares (which have a separate set of costs) of AWS, the total economic benefit for usage flows to the application owner.  Blockchain can moderate that imbalance.  Dapps utilize native tokens which allow users to purchase services and – if the service is popular – benefit from the increasing value of the token. In a public blockchain, tokens can be used to purchases a variety of services (e.g., storing data, playing a game, etc.). Token holders will be able to buy more services as the value of their purchased token go up.  Tokens also can be fungible and can be used across dapps in exchange for other types of services.  4. Proprietary Networks Versus Blockchain Open Source  Open-source technology projects have resulted in enormous improvements by providing bug-free software, raising tech performance, facilitating interoperability and reducing the total ownership cost of technology development.  Leading companies might have Apache servers running on a Linux operating system and utilizing databases that use PostgreSQL (which our relational blockchain platform, Postchain, utilizes). At the same time, few businesses have truly thrived on 100 percent open-source platforms. But, blockchain presents developers a potentially lower cost, resilient, highly-available platform more likely to achieve success.  Blockchain isn’t enterprise software by a different name. The technical architecture, data ownership model, and economics are fundamentally different.  Similar to emergence of the internet economy, the transition to an internet of value will not be a straight line. Success will come for those not reliant on some perfect ideal of the blockchain, but those who are able to design into systems the right sets of trade-offs which balance the needs of users, developers, and service providers.
