42381659,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nrjf,1551482379,$100 Million Short: QuadrigaCX Audit Can't Account for 26K Missing Bitcoin,"Ernst and Young (EY), the court-appointed monitor for QuadrigaCX, has finally provided blockchain addresses for the ailing crypto exchange's cold, or offline, bitcoin wallets.  And aside from $400,000 worth of bitcoin that was accidentally sent to the cold wallets in early February, they are empty, meaning $100 million of the cryptocurrency is still missing.  EY released its third report on Quadriga late Friday, outlining the progress it has made since first being appointed monitor at the beginning of February. While certain details in the report were already public, such as EY's progress getting third-party payment processors to transfer fiat holdings back to Quadriga, until now the audit firm had steadfastly refused to provide much information about its search for the exchange's missing cryptocurrencies.  To recap, Quadriga announced at the end of January that it owed its customers nearly $200 million in both cryptocurrencies and fiat, with crypto making up the bulk at around $137 million. These cryptocurrencies were inaccessible, the company said, as deceased founder and CEO Gerald Cotten reportedly kept the bulk of the exchange's holdings in cold storage, and only he controlled the private keys to its accounts.  Before Friday, neither Quadriga nor EY released the cold wallet addresses, prompting speculation that perhaps they do not exist.  Now, for the first time, EY has officially identified six bitcoin cold wallet addresses that it says Quadriga used. Five were previously identified by independent researchers after the exchange automatically transferred 103 BTC in what was termed a ""platform setting error."" On Friday afternoon, the total balance of these five wallets was 104 bitcoin, or about $400,000.  The sixth  address EY released contains no bitcoin holdings, though 31 BTC ($118,000) were transferred out from the wallet on Dec. 3, just days before Cotten's death.  That means 26,350 bitcoin (worth about $100 million) owed to customers was not in these cold wallets. According to the report:  ""The Monitor has made inquiries of the Applicants as to the reason for the lack of cryptocurrency reserves in the Identified Bitcoin Cold Wallets since April 2018. To date, the Applicants have been unable to identify a reason why Quadriga may have stopped using the Identified Bitcoin Cold Wallets for deposits in April 2018, however, the Monitor and Management will continue to review the Quadriga database to obtain further information.""  EY did not indicate if there might be other bitcoin cold storage wallets aside from the six published Friday. Nor did it identify the cold wallets holding ether, litecoin, bitcoin gold or any of the other coins the exchange listed.  Cold wallets aside, some $21,000 CAD ($16,000 USD) have been deposited in the form of various cryptocurrencies to Quadriga's hot, or, online, wallets since its initial filing on Jan. 31. EY is working with Quadriga to determine who has been depositing funds to the exchange's hot wallets, and a recommendation as to what to do about the situation will be presented later.  Exchanges  QuadrigaCX may have held accounts on at least 14 different crypto exchanges, the report said.  EY has reached out to these exchanges, and to date, four have responded. At least some of these exchanges confirmed that Cotten or Quadriga held accounts, and one has transferred a ""minimal"" amount of cryptocurrency to EY.  The report did not specify which exchanges these were.  Some of the cryptocurrencies previously held at the identified bitcoin cold wallets were provably sent to exchanges, EY said. While ""it is not possible to ascertain with absolute certainty from public information who the owner of an address is,"" existing tools can confirm that certain exchanges own specific addresses.  That being said, EY added that ""its investigation into the exchange accounts is at a preliminary stage,"" adding:  ""At this point, the Monitor has not been able to determine the source of the deposits into any of the exchange accounts or where the cryptocurrency was transferred to. Efforts are underway to attempt to preserve and recover any Quadriga cryptocurrency, if any, located at other exchanges.""  AWS accounts  Cotten appears to have set up an account with Amazon Web Services to store Quadriga data on, as did Jose Reyes, the owner and operator of two of the payment processors Quadriga used. According to the report, AWS told EY that it could not provide any further information as Cotten used a personal account for the platform.  As such, EY is asking for a court order to compel AWS to provide access to both it and Quadriga.  In particular, the monitor is looking for accounting records or some sort of ledger which can verify the accounts and balances that Quadriga controlled. So far, the company has gained access to some user account balances and transaction information.  ""The Monitor believes it is imperative that a copy of the Quadriga Platform Data is backed up and secured with the Monitor as soon as possible. The Platform Data will assist the Monitor’s ongoing investigation into Quadriga’s business, affairs and potential assets that may be recoverable for the benefit of the Applicants’ stakeholders,"" the report said.  Other notes  EY will support Quadriga's push to appoint a chief restructuring officer, which Jennifer Robertson – Cotten's widow and the executor of his estate – requested in a previous court filing. Robertson said she does not have the necessary experience to assist EY with its crypto investigations and that she has been disparaged in ""online commentary.""  Further, EY also agrees that extending the stay of proceedings implemented to protect Quadriga from investor lawsuits by 45 or 60 days ""is appropriate.""  On the other hand, Miller Thomson and Cox & Palmer, the two Canadian law firms appointed as representative counsel to represent the exchange's creditors, are requesting that only a 30-day extension be granted, as well as the right to amend or vary the initial order.  EY believes that granting one of the requests would be proper.  Miller Thomson separately issued a notice to affected users which included a call for applicants to serve on the committee of affected users ""which will provide information to and instruct representative counsel"" during the proceedings.  Interested creditors must apply by March 8.  Creditors who do not wish to be represented by the two law firms must opt out by April 29 by filing a separate form.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BTG,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/01/100-million-short-quadrigacx-audit-cant-account-for-26k-missing-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ed9eae23e39b33ac663078c2aadf3dd5a909cc2-1497x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announcing the news on Twitter on Friday, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said:  ""To test the hell out of @Binance_DEX, we are giving away roughly $100,000 USD equivalent, in REAL $BNB, as reward for our testnet trading competition.""  The initiative, he said, would help the exchange launch the mainnet, or live version, of Binance DEX more quickly.  According to Binance's website, the funds will be made available as prizes in a simulated trading competition kicking off next Thursday.  Exchange users who hold at least one Binance Coin token (BNB) in their account will be eligible to participate in the event. Each account can register up to 20 Binance Chain addresses and will receive 200 virtual BNB tokens for each address to use as starting funds for the competition.  The firm noted that the Binance Chain testnet will be reset before 08:00 UTC on March 7, clearing all existing asset balances. Once complete, trading for the competition will commence.  Two contests  Binance is dividing the competition into two different events, with prizes in BNB for each.  Firstly, there's the ""Token Competition for Healthy Price Volatility,"" which will see users compete to issue and list tokens on the testnet.  ""The addresses that own tokens will be ranked in terms of the sum of each token price’s volatility over every five-minute interval on the 'Token'/BNB trading pair during the competition period,"" the exchange says.  There are three prizes up for grabs, ranging from 1,000–3,000 BNB.  Secondly, there an ""Absolute Return Competition"" event that will be ranked according to the absolute returns users achieve with their trading strategies on specific tokens. This one offers 20 prizes ranging from 50–1,000 BNB.  The BNB token is trading at just over $11 at press time, according to CoinMarketCap data.  Binance announced on Feb. 20 that the DEX was open for public testing, allowing users to create wallets and interact with the trading platform’s interface. At the same time, it revealed a blockchain explorer for the testnet of its Binance Chain network, which supports the DEX.

42402631,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbpfi,1551472252,Ripple Scores Minor Victory in US Securities Class Action,"A judge has ruled that an ongoing class action lawsuit against Ripple must remain in federal court, potentially giving the payments firm a slight advantage going forward.  U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton, of the Northern District of California, ruled Thursday that a class action lawsuit filed against Ripple and affiliated subsidiaries and individuals would not be shifted back to lower courts after lawyers for the company first moved to district court last year.  This is a ""minor but meaningful victory"" for the firm, said Kobre Kim attorney Jake Chervinsky on Twitter.  Stephen Palley, a partner at Anderson Kill, previously told CoinDesk that typically, corporate defendants in cases feel more comfortable with federal courts as lower court juries and judges are locally selected and thus could be more sympathetic to plaintiffs.  Chervinsky agreed, noting that ""Ripple fought hard"" to keep the case at the federal court level.  The case centers around XRP. The plaintiffs in the case allege that Ripple issued the cryptocurrency as an unregistered securities offering, a claim Ripple has frequently denied.  Ripple Labs, its subsidiary XRP II, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and a number of other individuals have been named as defendants in the case.  Long term  Despite Ripple's win on the jurisdictional question, ""the case won’t go to trial for years, if it goes to trial at all,"" Chervinsky told CoinDesk via email. The lawsuit will have to move past several other stages, starting with a likely motion to dismiss.  ""Ripple will argue that the complaint fails to state a legally cognizable claim as a matter of law, even assuming all the allegations in the complaint are true,"" he said.  If a judge rules against such a motion, or if Ripple decides not to file one, the plaintiffs can then file for class certification. Right now, Chervinsky explained, ""the lawsuit is styled as a class action but technically does not become one until and unless the Court grants a motion for class certification.""  Only then can the discovery process begin, which would include plaintiffs and defendants exchanging documents, answering questions and conducting depositions.  The case would still have to sort through motions for summary judgment before the judge can determine whether a trial is necessary.  Possible settlements?  It is entirely possible the case may end prior to this, however. Ripple and the plaintiffs may choose to settle the case, though Chervinsky does not believe this can happen in the immediate future due to procedural roadblocks.  In particular, any settlement prior to class certification would result in individual payouts to the plaintiffs currently attached to the lawsuit. This would not prevent any future lawsuits from being filed against Ripple, and the investors suing the firm would likely not recover much of the funds.  Should the parties settle after class certification, members of the class would waive their rights to another lawsuit, which the company would likely prefer.  ""As a result, there isn’t much incentive for Ripple or the plaintiffs to settle the case before the class certification stage,"" Chervinsky said.  He noted that while this case has been before the court system since May 2018, very litigation has actually occurred. ""Ripple still hasn’t had to file a substantive response to any of the plaintiffs’ complaints,""Chervinsky said, adding:  ""This demonstrates a few points: (1) Ripple’s litigation team seems comfortable delaying the case as long as possible; (2) assuming Ripple’s strategy is to delay, they are so far executing that strategy with great success; and (3) it will probably be a very long time – on the order of months or years – before this dispute is finally resolved.""  According to Thursday's ruling, the parties now have two weeks to meet and determine how they might want to proceed. The plaintiffs have 30 days to file an amended consolidated complaint, while Ripple has 30 days to file a motion to dismiss or notify the court that it does not intend to do so.

42402632,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbpdk,1551468610,Angry Bitcoin Fans Delete Coinbase Accounts to Protest Neutrino Acquisition,"The battle cry #DeleteCoinbase is resounding across crypto Twitter as bitcoin users close their accounts to protest a controversial acquisition by the exchange.  These users are upset with Coinbase for acquiring Neutrino because that blockchain analytics outfit’s executive suite – CEO Giancarlo Russo, CTO Alberto Ornaghi, and CRO Marco Valleri – previously spearheaded projects for the startup Hacking Team, which sold spyware to several governments known for human rights abuses.  For example, the Washington Post reported Hacking Team worked directly with the Saudi Arabian government, including the enforcement group that allegedly murdered dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The startup’s website touted a “hacking suite for governmental interception,” describing its wares as “offensive technology.” This spyware also aided surveillance and arrests of journalists in Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates, Motherboard reported.  To be sure, it’s unclear how widespread the backlash is. The #deletecoinbase hashtag produces more than 500 results on a Google search, but not all of those are unique, nor are all of them necessarily from before the acquisition was announced. Further, even 500 would amount to a sliver of Coinbase’s 13 million accounts.  Nevertheless, for many influential figures in the blockchain world, the transaction was a deal-breaker.  Meltem Demirors, founder of Shiny Pony Ventures and chief strategy officer at the asset manager CoinShares, told CoinDesk she will no longer use Coinbase after this incident.  “There are so many other services out there that do [blockchain analysis] that don’t have these reputational issues, and frankly the ethical issues that some of these Neutrino founders have,” Demirors said. “This example, to me, clashes with all the messages [Coinbase] are trying to put out there about creating an open financial system, a more inclusive financial system.”  Simply put, she said:  “This acquisition of Neutrino supports the idea of using bitcoin for surveillance capitalism.”  Coinbase declined to comment by time of publication about the number of vocal users now leaving the platform. We will update the article if we hear back.  Risk vs. reward  Last month, Coinbase’s director of engineering and product, Varun Srinivasan, told CoinDesk that Neutrino would allow Coinbase to expand cryptocurrency listings quickly while retaining data analysis services in-house. In a statement to The Block, a Coinbase spokesperson said the company was aware of the Neutrino team’s past but felt the significance of this business opportunity outweighed that consideration.  Indeed, the reputational risks were not hidden. In 2013, the nonprofit Reporters Without Borders even called Hacking Team one of the top five corporate “Enemies of the Internet” for its role in helping various government's crackdown on critics, including precarious situations in Sudan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Mexico, just to name a few. Then in 2017, Italy’s Ministry of Economic Developmenthttps://www.mise.gov.it/index.php/it/per-i-media/notizie/comunicati-stampa/2035887-gia-sospesa-autorizzazione-a-area-per-esportazione-in-egitto-sistema-monitoraggio-comunicazioni stated that Hacking Team’s exports of surveillance technologies to countries like Egypt posed a clear risk to human rights abroad.  Yet among those offended by Coinbase’s affiliation with the Hacking Team veterans, many users are posting complaints on social media about difficulty closing their accounts.  This is partially because an account needs to be completely empty in order to close it and most users retain tiny fractions of bitcoin, called “dust,” left over after a transaction due to transaction fees and fluctuating prices. These fractions can sometimes be too small to easily send on their own to empty the account.  It remains to be seen whether the controversy will make any meaningful dent in Coinbase’s user base, given the platform’s convenience for entry-level users and the hassle associated with switching providers – a source of customer inertia in financial services since long before cryptocurrency was invented.  “People vote with their feet. Look at what happened to Facebook. A lot of users left Facebook because they didn’t like what was happening. The best jury is what people are looking to use,” Demirors said.

42402636,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbpgh,1551461452,Ethereum Developers Start Search for New Hard Fork Coordinator,"Developers in the ethereum community are seeking a new specialist to help coordinate major software upgrades.  Following the departure of core developer Afri Schoedon from the open-source project in late February, ethereum developers discussed the issue of who would take his place in coordinating hard forks, or system-wide software upgrades, in a meeting Friday. Schoeden left just last week after favorable remarks he made about another blockchain project sparked social media outcry.  The role as highlighted by Ethereum Foundation community relations manager Hudson Jameson would consist of “[deciding] on hard dates for submitting [Ethereum Improvement Proposals] for consideration, deciding on those EIPs, implementation and testing and then finally what day the hard fork would be.”  “Of course, they wouldn’t be a dictator in this regard, but they would be the one to come up with suggestions or different options to bring to the table,” added Jameson during the call.  Rather than delegating the role to a single individual, ethereum core developers agreed that the role of hard fork coordination could be split between two to three individuals.  Highlighting that a number of candidates have already stepped up to offer their support, Jameson concluded that the task of assessing applicants would be delegated to a group of ethereum volunteers called the ""Ethereum Cat Herders.""  The group was initially started back in January by developer Lane Rettig, Jameson and Schoedon “for the broader purpose of coordination and project management” within the ethereum ecosystem.  Coordinating the 'ProgPow' Audits  Having successfully implemented two hard forks yesterday, ethereum core developers are now preparing for the next system-wide upgrade called Istanbul, as well as a possible upgrade to a new mining algorithm known as ProgPoW.  On the latter subject, Jameson gave an update explaining that blockchain testing platform WhiteBlock would be responsible for conducting benchmarking experiments comparing the performance of various ethereum mining devices on ProgPoW. A second audit is also in the works to test whether specialized mining hardware can be built and deployed to take advantage of the proposed mining algorithm.  At this time, the Cat Herders have not finalized a company to proceed with the second audit.  Jameson also noted during today’s call that over half of the miners in the ethereum ecosystem – 55 percent to be exact – are in favor of ProgPoW according to stats from an ongoing “hashvote” using blockchain analytics site, EtherChainhttps://www.etherchain.org/charts/progpow.  As Jameson explained, hashvotes are specifically targeted at ethereum miners in the ecosystem who by leveraging an extra data field during their operations can indicate whether or not they favor the proposal.  However, as pointed out by core developer Alexey Akhunov, these results may depict a somewhat skewed interpretation of miner signaling, saying:  “There is another interpretation which could be useful of this 55 percent number...Essentially if those 55 percent who turned out all voted in favor that gives you essentially a lower bound on how many GPUs are currently mining in the network.”  The comments show that discussion on implementation of the proposal are still ongoing.

42402649,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbprW,1551459617,Blockstream Releases Lightning Upgrade With New 'Plugin' Functionality,"New improvements to an existing code repository are set to make it easier for developers to build their own features into bitcoin's lightning network, the in-progress tech layer many see as the cryptocurrency's best hope for its use in payments.  Announced Thursday, Blockstream is making the largest upgrade to its c-lightning software in eight months, releasing a new version that features a batch of upgrades. Notable among them is a feature called ""plugins"" that the company hopes will make it easier for coders to build features into the payment system, even for those who don't consider themselves coders.  Already, developers are already proving eager to build lightning network apps – as examples, a seven-year-old built a zombie hunting game that takes bitcoin lightning payments, and as of last week, it's even possible to order pizza courtesy of a crafty custom website.  Blockstream's new code release provides an interface that makes it easier for developers to build their own features into the c-lightning code, supporting plugins written in C, Go, and Python.  This could be a whole range of things, like monitoring tools or extra channel features. This customizability is one way c-lightning is different than other lightning network implementations, like LND and Eclair.  ""It goes back to an early decision we made. We thought, we could tell people what they can do and can't do or we could decide to give people the tools and a sanctioned way to go on and build the functionality they want,"" said Blockstream engineer Christian Decker, who pioneered the plugin idea.  The Blockstream engineering team chose the latter route, he said, adding:  ""By extending it on their own and adding their own favorite feature, this allows users to sort of make it their own lightning node, so to speak.""  Hello, World  Still, even those behind the release aren't exactly sure what hobbyists and businesses will end up building with the code they've just released.  Blockstream engineer Rusty Russell told CoinDesk: ""This opens up infinite possibilities."" That said, Decker has already written a few tools to show what devs can build with it.  This includes a small ""monitoring"" tool that runs alongside a node ""checking if it's alive and kicking,"" as well as a ""probing"" plugin that pings other random lightning nodes on the network to see how well other nodes react, helping developers determine which parts of the network are still rickety.  Decker has also kicked off a list of plugins that he'll add to as developers come up with new creations.  The hope is this new ability to make plugins will make life easier for developers. Many developers contribute to open-source lightning projects like c-lightning as hobbies in their spare time.  ""It's also a stealth recruitment drive. We hope people will get suckered in after using these plugins. C-lightning will get free labor. That's what open source is,"" Russell joked.  But, ideally, it could also be used by people who only know a little coding.  ""If you can write 'hello world,' you can write a plugin for c-lightning,"" Decker said, referring to the first program newbie coders typically create when learning the ropes.  Things to wince at  Plug-ins are the main feature in c-lightning, but there are others too, including a variety of bug fixes.  Russell was excited about a feature he called ""route boost"" that will help to make payments more reliable -- one of the key problems with making payments on the network so far.  With this release, they also will support ""reproducible builds"" for the first time, making completely sure the software works across multiple operating systems (like Windows and Mac) with the help of mathematical proofs. It's an important part of many open-source infrastructure projects, including the most-used bitcoin software, Bitcoin Core, and popular privacy browser Tor.  Beyond 0.7, the developers have lots of other ideas for improving the technology down the road, including getting a start on the new lightning 1.1 spec dreamed up at a developer summit in Adelaide, Australia, and outlining new features that will make payments more user-friendly.  These features are really needed to make lightning easier to use.  Russell pointed to the lightning torch, a popular grassroots game where users (even Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman) have been passing around a lightning payment, adding a little to it each time it's passed. As a sort of unintended side-effect, it's shown some of the problems lightning has so far.  As the payment has snowballed into one worth roughly $200 in bitcoin, the payment has gotten too big to be easy to send. It makes it hard to find a route to send a payment to someone else.  ""We look at these things and we wince,"" Russell said.  Yet, he's been really impressed by how people have been coming up with ways to send the payment anyway, such as splitting up payments. ""It shows how much people really want this,"" he said.

42422905,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qyxh,1551455420,$404 Million to $100 Million: GSR to Cut Overstock tZERO Investment 75%,"A long-awaited capital infusion for Overstock and its tZERO security token platform has been delayed again – and significantly downsized.  GSR Capital, a Hong Kong-based private equity firm, was supposed to close the $404 million investment on Feb. 28. But on Friday, Overstock said the deal had not closed, and the parties are now in talks for a much smaller amount – $100 million – to be completed in mid-April.  What's more, an additional investor has been brought in, Makara Capital of Singapore, which Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne described in a press release as a ""key partner of GSR Capital.""  GSR and Makara have signed an memorandum of understanding (MOU) with tZERO to set the terms for a future transaction in which ""Makara and GSR would co-lead an investment of up to $100 million in tZERO common stock and close the transaction in April subject to due diligence, negotiation of binding contracts and regulatory approval,"" Byrne said.  According to the MOU, published today by Overstock, after investing $100 million in tZERO, GSR and Makara will obtain a right to issue their security tokens on the platform. If tZERO in the future issue more tokens, the investors can ""participate in such offerings and nominate additional investors.""  The new deal gives tZERO $1.5 billion valuation — the same that was stated in the previous one. The MOU does not spell out how large the investors' stake would be, but it is likely smaller than the originally agreed-upon 18% given the smaller amount of money being invested and the valuation being held constant.  GSR's and Makara's representatives and agents will get ""full access to tZERO's management, consultants, accountants, advisors and all other representatives, and to all properties, operating and financial data, records, agreements and other information"" related to the deal, except non-public information. The two firms will also help tZERO with its expansion in Asia and other parts of the world and connect the U.S. startup to the companies they invested in before, including a ""digital bank into which Makara is actively leading an investment,"" the document says.  ""Following the recent successful launch of tZERO’s new security token trading technology, we are excited by the emerging partnerships and business opportunities in front of us,"" Byrne said. ""More information on Overstock’s retail and blockchain properties will be shared within our upcoming 2018 FY Earnings reporting. I urge you to join us for that discussion of our business at a time and date to be announced soon.""  'Disheartening'  The deal was originally supposed to close on Dec. 15, but in December GSR asked for an extension to the end of February.  In the earlier agreement, GSR was to invest up to $404 million in Overstock and tZERO, including the purchase of $30 million worth of TZEROP tokens at the price of $6.67 per token and $104.5 million worth of Overstock shares at $33.72 per share. But both assets have fallen sharply in value since then.  At the moment, TZEROP is traded on tZERO's alternative trading system (ATS) at $3.50 per token (just over a third of tZERO's security token offering price of $10), and Overstock's shares now are traded at $19.16 per share.  Traders who invested in tZERO have been waiting for news about the deal for several months, expecting it to boost the falling price of the token. Friday's announcement left many disappointed.  “The news is disheartening,” the trader Sean LaFlamme told CoinDesk. “It’s another extension in a long list of them. ... If I am not sure tZERO is adequately funded, I won’t be putting further investment in it.”  UPDATE (March 1, 5:34 UTC): This article was updated with additional information published in a new SEC filing by Overstock.

First, the purpose of a token should be for a ""consumptive purpose"" and “only be exchangeable for, or provided for the receipt of, goods, services or content, including rights of access to goods, services or content.”  Secondly, developers or sellers of a token should not sell it to the initial buyer as a financial investment, they said, adding:  “If the token does not have a consumptive purpose available at the time of sale, the initial buyer of the token is prevented from reselling the token until the token is available for use for a consumptive purpose.”  Further, the proposed legislation says that individuals who facilitate the exchange of open blockchain tokens should not be treated as brokers-dealers or those who deal in securities, provided they “electronically file a notice of intent with the secretary of state” in advance.  The bill defines open blockchain token as a digital unit which is created, recorded in a digital ledger, and is ""capable of being traded or transferred between persons without an intermediary or custodian of value.""  Over in Colorado, a similar bill was passed by state senators on Wednesday and is now awaiting a signature from the state governor before it becomes law.  Senate bill 23 – dubbed the “Colorado Digital Token Act” – was filed last month, proposing that digital tokens with a “primarily consumptive” purpose should be exempted from securities laws provided they are not marketed for “speculative or investment” purposes.

42402626,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbpbm,1551441608,Mark Karpeles Fails to Halt US Court Case Over Mt Gox Losses,"Mark Karpeles, the former CEO of bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, has been refused a motion to stay a U.S. court case brought by former investors.  Earlier this week, Karpeles had filed the motion to stay in ""light of ongoing civil rehabilitation proceedings in Japan that are likely to provide full recovery"" to the plaintiffs, Gregory Greene and Anthony Motto. The plaintiffs brought the case saying that they hold Karpeles ""personally liable"" for any losses they occurred from their investments in bitcoin made through Mt. Gox.  At the court for the Northern District of Illinois, judge Gary Feinerman ruled Thursday, however, that Karpeles’s motion is denied.  Mt. Gox officially filed for liquidation in April 2014 after claiming to have been hacked for 850,000 bitcoins, although some was later found in a ""forgotten"" wallet.  In his motion, Karpeles said that “through a series of events, notably the recovery of a significant amount of lost bitcoins and the rise in the value of bitcoins, the likelihood that Plaintiffs and others will obtain a full recovery in Mt. Gox’s Japanese legal proceedings is high.”  He continued:  “In light of the status of the Japanese proceedings, this case should be stayed in order to conserve judicial resources and to preclude unnecessary legal expenses.”  Following the judge's denial, a status hearing will now be held on May 1.  Karpeles is also facing a court case in Japan, where prosecutors are seeking a 10-year sentence for embezzlement over claims he used about $3 million of customers’ funds for his own personal use, among other allegations. In his closing arguments in a Tokyo court in December 2018, Karpeles restated his innocence in the case.  Earlier last year, he apologized for the company’s bankruptcy, saying, “I never imagined things would end this way and I am forever sorry for everything that’s taken place and all the effect it had on everyone involved.”  The defunct exchange first opened up the claims process for creditors last August, after the Japanese bankruptcy court overseeing the proceedings shifted the case to one of civil rehabilitation. That ruling meant creditors could file for their original cryptocurrency holdings, rather than a fiat equivalent based on crypto prices in 2014. The deadline for claims has now passed.

42402654,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbptU,1551438008,Bitcoin Awaits Decisive Price Move as Trading Range Tightens,"View  Bitcoin's retreat from highs near $3,900 seen yesterday has poured cold water over the bull mood generated by Wednesday's quick recovery from lows near $3,650. Therefore, the immediate outlook is neutral.  A UTC close above $3,897 (previous day's high) would validate Wednesday's long-tailed candle and open the doors to re-test of the last week's high of $4,190. This looks likely as early signs of bullish reversal have emerged on longer duration charts.  A break below $3,658 (Wednesday's low) would strengthen the bearish view put forward by last Sunday's high-volume sell-off and could yield a drop to $3,400.  Bitcoin has witnessed indecisive trading in the last 48 hours and would turn bullish again if prices rise above $3,897.  The crypto market leader jumped to a high of $3,897 yesterday, according to Bistamp data, having shown strength with a ""V-shaped"" recovery from lows near $3,650 on Wednesday.  That bullish follow-through, however, was short-lived with prices closing (UTC) largely unchanged on the day at $3,791.  So, with buyers and sellers battling it out in the range of $3,650-$3,900, the immediate outlook is neutral.  The probability of bulls coming out victorious with a move above $3,900 is high, as the dip demand witnessed on Wednesday reinforced the high-volume bullish triangle breakout, confirmed on Feb. 19. Also, so far, the follow-through to the pullback from yesterday's high of $3,897 has been anything but bearish.  BTC is currently trading at $3,810 on Bitstamp, having snapped the record six-month losing streak with double-digit gains in February.  Daily chart  BTC created a candle with a long upper shadow yesterday, establishing $3,897 is a level to beat for the bulls in the short-term. A UTC close above that level would validate the ""buy the dip"" mentality signaled by Wednesday’s long-tailed doji and open the doors to $4,190 (last week’s high).  A bull breakout, however, may remain elusive, if prices find acceptance below $3,658 (Wednesday’s low). That would put the focus back on the big bearish outside reversal candle carved out on Feb. 24 and possibly yield a deeper drop toward $3,400.  4-hour chart  As seen above, the ascending 100-candle moving average (MA) has been limiting the downside since Feb. 24. The average is also holding above the 200-candle MA, meaning the trend is bullish.  The bullish case, however, would weaken if the 100-candle MA, currently at $3,778, is convincingly breached.  However, with the longer duration charts flashing early signs of a bullish reversal, as discussed earlier this week, the odds of BTC suffering deeper losses toward $3,400 appear low.

The country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued rules last July, mandating that any entity seeking to conduct a token sale must first file for an application for its approval. At the time, the SEC said that only Thailand's national currency, the baht, and seven cryptocurrencies can be used to invest in ICOs: bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH), ether classic (ETC), litecoin (LTC), XRP and stellar (XLM).  In an announcement Thursday, the SEC said it has now removed bitcoin cash, ether classic and litecoin from the list of eligible cryptocurrencies. As a result, only the remaining four cryptocurrencies are permitted it said, with a reminder that the list is “not a certification of their legal tender status.”  The watchdog did not provide any detail as to why the list has been reduced, though it said it takes into account different factors such as news and other developments related to tokens.  ""In any case, the list update has no impact on investors or digital asset businesses because so far no ICO has been launched and the operating digital asset exchanges have never used BCH, ETC or LTC as base trading pairs,” the SEC said.  The regulator added that it provides the list of eligible cryptocurrencies in compliance with the Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses B.E. 2561 (2018).  Last week, the country's National Legislative Assembly approved an amendment to the Securities and Exchange Act legalizing the issuance of tokenized securities such as stocks and bonds.

The Fed's board of governors on Thursday announced amendments to a policy statement on the scenario design framework for stress testing, saying that ""the collapse of the bitcoin market” may be considered as one of the ""salient"" market risks.  According to the document, the crypto amendment was recommended to the board by a commenter who proposed it should be seen as one of several “extraordinary shocks,” such as a war with North Korea and major losses caused by trader misconduct.  The board said it aims to make supervisory stress tests “sufficiently dynamic” by including salient market risks in the scenario design framework. Such risks have been included since the inception of supervisory stress tests, with recent additions being oil price shocks and a severe recession in the euro area, among others.  “Where appropriate, the Board intends to continue augmenting the scenarios with risks it considers to be salient,” it explained.  Supervisory stress tests of eligible firms are conducted annually by the Board pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and the Board's stress test rules.  The Fed board also explains the reasons for the tests, saying:  ""Together, the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests are intended to provide company management and boards of directors, the public, and supervisors with forward-looking information to help gauge the potential effect of stressful conditions on the ability of these large banking organizations to absorb losses, while meeting obligations to creditors and other counterparties and continuing to lend.""  The board has developed three stress-test scenarios – ""baseline,"" ""adverse"" and ""severely adverse"" – and projects a firm's balance sheet, risk-weighted assets (RWA), net income, resulting post-stress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios, among other factors under each one.  Any of Thursday's amendments to the stress-test policy that are adopted will come into effect on April 1.  Also likely to be included are amendments adding a change in the unemployment rate of less than 4 percent under certain economic conditions, and a decline in the nominal house price index – both under the ""severely adverse"" scenario.  The amendments follow the recent comments from the new chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Randal K. Quarles, who also serves as the vice chair for supervision at the Fed board of governors.  Quarles said last month: “This will not be easy – developments like the emergence of crypto-assets may challenge any framework – but that makes the goal of a robust framework all the more important.”  Federal Reserve image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/01/federal-reserve-may-add-bitcoin-crash-to-stress-test-scenarios,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9fb49f98b85979cba937d31a74d8ddbfc7825fa6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Michael Haley quietly left his job as product manager at digital securities platform AlphaPoint in November to join the crypto custody provider Casa, CoinDesk has learned.  A long-time bitcoiner who began attending community meetups and participating in online discussions in 2014, he said now is the perfect time “to get back into good old bitcoin.”  Citing among other encouraging trends the blossoming of the lighting network for small bitcoin payments, Haley told CoinDesk:  “In the bear market, it’s an exciting time to get back into bitcoin. It’s never been as exciting, especially with Lightning — it’s a totally different culture, a very developer-centered culture, and a very special time.""  At Casa, Haley is a product experience lead who takes care of onboarding new clients, “making sure that the product meets their needs,” he said.  As the Casa wallet is designed to store large amounts of bitcoin, the clients need to be properly instructed and assisted to make their experience smooth and safe.  “It’s not a daily wallet where money is going in and out every day,"" Haley said. ""It’s a system designed to store hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin, if not millions, for long-term savings and planning. And because the stakes are so high it’s extremely important that the clients feel comfortable.”  'Original sin'  At AlphaPoint, which he joined in 2015, Haley helped launch customers' trading platforms, designed product features and led partnerships with CME Group and the U.K. Royal Mint.  Although he loves the AlphaPoint's team, Haley said, he was happy to get his hands on a product dealing with a public blockchain.  The security token space, where much (though not all) of the work utilizes private blockchains, has been getting a lot of attention for the last year. But Haley said he believes that the most exciting innovations are going to happen first on the public blockchains and only after that get applied to the regulated markets.  ""We think it’s an industry-wide problem, and one of the original sins of the crypto companies was that they were building the services where the end users didn’t control their keys,"" Haley said.  AlphaPoint declined to comment on Haley's departure but noted that his position had been filled by Asha Dakshinamoorthy, who joined in February from ethereum design studio ConsenSys and earlier worked as a tech strategy and blockchain consultant at Deloitte.

42402655,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbpuT,1551416428,Crypto Winter Thaws As February Proves Month of Market Gains,"With February's crypto market activity now etched in the record books, signs are emerging that a long crypto winter may be close to an end.  The total market value of all cryptocurrencies jumped 14.14 percent over the 28-day period – the first monthly gain since July, according to CoinMarketCap, largely due to signs of life in bitcoin. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, BTC appreciated by 12.1 percent to end February by breaking its record six-month losing streak.  But while BTC lifted the broader market, lesser-known names like Maker (MKR), Theta Token (THETA), Enjin (ENJ) and Metronome (MET) outshined with double-digit gains.  Of the four, MKR was the month's best performing large-cap cryptocurrency, defined as one with a market capitalization above $500 million. THETA was the outperformer from the mid-cap group, while ENJ and Metronome (MET) were the top entries from the small- and micro-cap groups, respectively.  The data and analytics website Messari segments cryptocurrencies on the basis of their market cap as follows: large caps (>$500 million), medium caps ($100 million -$500 million), small caps (<$100 million) and micro caps (<$10 million).  Let us now dive into their individual performance details:  MAKER (large cap)  Monthly performance: 83.6 percentAll-time high: $1,763.64Closing price February 28: $675Market capitalization February 28: $668.1 million  Maker (MKR) topped the large-cap segment with an 83.6percent gain over the course of February and was able to reach $773 on February 24 – its highest price since early October.  As it stands, MKR is the second most expensive cryptocurrency in the entire market after the world's largest, bitcoin. MKR is one of two separate digital assets operating within the MakerDAO ecosystem along with its subsidiary stablecoin Dai (DAI).  MKR tokens are created or destroyed depending upon certain price fluctuations of DAI in order to keep the stablecoin pegged to the USD.  CoinDesk recently reported a substantial increase in Maker’s Collateralized Debt Positions, with the total amount of ether locked up in MakerDAO loans now having crossed above 2 million, a notable feat amid the crypto winter.  The monthly price chart indeed reflects the degree of bullishness that took place. As can be seen above, the monthly candlestick has engulfed the three prior months and closed above its 14-month long falling channel - both of which suggest more bullish price action will be seen in MKR’s near future.  THETA (mid-cap)  Monthly performance: +167 percent  All-time high: $0.31  Closing price February 28: $0.1414  Market capitalization February 28: $123.8 million  Theta token dominated the mid-cap segment this month, boasting a 167 percent rise to close out February as one of the top performing cryptocurrencies in the entire market.  The nearest mid-cap contender to Theta’s impressive showing was Ontology (ONT) which stood at 64.1 percent over the 28-day period.  Theta is an open-source protocol that enables a decentralized streaming network which, in partnership with SLIVER.tv, offer esports entertainment, peer-to-peer streaming and allows for decentralized apps (dapps) to be built on top of the platform.  It could be speculated that the majority of Theta’s bullish momentum is attributed to positive project developments within the Theta ecosystem.  For instance, It’s likely investors have been and still are pricing in Theta’s airdrop of Theta Fuel tokens set to occur on March 12 and its upcoming mainnet launch on March 15.  While Theta’s recent technical price developments are undoubtedly bullish, including its breaking of a 9-month downtrend and printing its first positive value on the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) since June, investors may want to proceed with caution as the price is now overextended on the smaller time frames and is at risk of witnessing a “sell the news” reaction.  ENJIN (small-cap)  Monthly performance: +180 percent  All-time high: $0.49  Closing price February 28: $0.08201  Market capitalization February 28: $62.5 million  Enjin Coin (ENJ), the cryptocurrency for virtual goods powered by Enjin, saw a 180 percent increase in February’s to conclude the month atop the list of the best performances by small-cap coins.  Not only that, ENJ was able to record its most trading volume in a single month of 244 million, which is a total roughly four times than its entire market capitalization.  The reason for ENJ’s significant price boost is easier to pinpoint than the other cryptocurrencies, largely due to the fact ENJ surged over 190 percent from Feb. 25 to Feb. 26 on the back of a rumored partnership with tech giant Samsung.  While the partnership is not yet confirmed, ENJ’s price chart has indeed broken its bearish trend on the high time frames. As can be seen above, February monthly candlestick has set a higher price high above multi-month resistance levels, effectively shifting the trend from bearish to bullish favor.  Price will now look to close on a monthly basis above the next significant resistance level of $0.10 in order to provide confirmation of more upside.  Metronome (micro-cap)  Monthly performance: +43 percent  All-time high: $4.56  Closing price on February 28: $0.89  Market capitalization February 28: $8.49 million  Metronome (MET) outperformed all cryptocurrencies with a market cap below $10 million in February, boasting a 44.38 percent price increase. The next best performer in the micro-capp segment, Numariarire (NMR) came a close second with a 41 percent increase on the month of Feb.  MET didn’t set any notable trading volume records or witness any outlier single day performances as its price increase was gradual throughout the entire month, but was able to break its weekly bearish trend by setting a high above the previous swing high of roughly $0.97.  There is reason for caution, however, since there was no increase in volume upon the change in trend. This could be seen as a false breakout without proper validation from an increase in trading volumes.
