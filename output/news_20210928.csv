Berkovitz had previously announced his intention to leave the derivatives market regulator as of Oct. 1.  The move places Berkovitz, who recently warned that many DeFi derivatives may violate federal law, in a key court-facing role at one of the U.S.‚Äôs top investment regulators. The Office of the General Counsel manages much of the SEC‚Äôs litigation and makes recommendations on enforcement actions, rule making and inter-agency activity.  That broad mandate could clash with crypto in any number of ways. The SEC‚Äôs top brass has adopted a hardline tone against bad actors in the crypto space, and Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly emphasized consumer protection, prompting calls of overreach by many participants in the crypto space.  Berkovitz voiced a similar, pro-oversight tone toward crypto while at the CFTC:  ‚ÄúBlockchains, smart contracts, and other new technologies have the potential to improve the transparency and efficiency of our derivatives markets. However, for innovation to be responsible and competition to be fair, it must comply with the [Commodity Exchange Act] and our regulations,‚Äù he said when the CFTC fined BitMEX $100 million.

Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) that ‚Äúbroad consultation and, ultimately, authorizing legislation from Congress‚Äù would be ‚Äúideal.‚Äù  A two-and-a-half hour committee hearing intended to discuss the CARES Act ‚Äì the $2.2 trillion economic stimulus package signed into law by then-President Donald Trump in March 2020 ‚Äì became heated as committee members debated the upcoming vote to raise the debt ceiling, which Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said had to be done by Oct. 18 for the U.S. government to avoid a default on its existing legal obligations, including Social Security benefits and military salaries.  Powell endorsed Congress passing legislation that would authorize a digital dollar, responding to a question from Toomey about whether such legislation was needed.  Toomey was the only lawmaker to ask cryptocurrency-related questions, telling the Fed chair the U.S. central bank may not be well-suited to becoming a retail bank, and advocating for a combination of privately issued digital currencies and a true central bank digital currency.  ‚ÄúThe privacy of Americans has to be respected,‚Äù Toomey said. ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt design a central bank digital dollar that allows the government to spy on Americans every transaction.‚Äù  Broader regulation  Though the debt ceiling standoff was the main topic of conversation, issues of financial privacy were also featured during Tuesday‚Äôs hearing.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) took a different stance on financial regulation, calling Powell a ‚Äúdangerous man‚Äù for his history of ‚Äúderegulatory actions.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYour record gives me grave concern,‚Äù Warren told Powell. ‚ÄúOver and over, you have acted to make our banking system less safe ‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs why I will oppose your renomination‚Äù as head of the U.S. central bank when his term ends in 2022.

42376122,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwETrp,1632862113,Market Wrap: Traders Seek Protection as Crypto and Stocks Dip on US Debt Ceiling Impasse,"Cryptocurrencies were mostly lower on Tuesday, tracking losses in equities after the U.S. Senate failed to act to extend the debt ceiling and avoid a partial federal government shutdown as soon as Oct.15.  The 10-year Treasury bond yield rose to 1.50%, the highest level since June, accompanied by a rally in the dollar as investors position themselves for a potential government default. When bond yields go up the bond price falls, and vice versa.  ‚ÄúIn equities, we are about to enter the most dangerous month of the year ‚Äì October has been the month where crashes and major corrections take place,‚Äù Charlie Silver, CEO of Permission.io, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  ‚ÄúCrypto is vacillating between resistance and support, waiting for regulatory clarity in the U.S. and central bank moves around the Chinese debt crisis,‚Äù Silver wrote, referring to the turmoil over real estate developer Evergrande.  Bitcoin was trading around $41,000 at press time and is down nearly 3% over the past 24 hours, compared to a loss of over 3% in ether over the same period.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC), $41,814, -2.5%  Ether (ETH), $2,871, -3.4%  S&P 500: -2.0%  Gold: $1,734, -0.9%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.548%  Ether option expirations  Ether, the world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, dipped below $3,000 this week, causing some traders to seek ways of cutting their losses.  The trading volume of ETH put options expiring on Oct. 8 has soared, according to data from Deribit, a crypto futures and options exchange. A large number of put options is seen around the $2,700 price level, which, if breached, can trigger long liquidations. A put option is a contract giving the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell, or sell short, a specified amount of an underlying security at a pre-determined price within a specified time frame.  For now, technical charts show initial support for ether at the 100-day moving average, currently around $2,760, although upside momentum has significantly slowed.  ‚ÄúThe market aggressively paid for over 13,000x contracts of Oct. 8 ETH puts since Asia morning, and front-end risk reversal skewed heavily toward puts once again,‚Äù crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram announcement.  ‚ÄúWe remain wary of ETH downside for any near-term potential leg down,‚Äù QCP wrote.  Uniswap peak growth  Uniswap, an automated decentralized finance (DeFi) exchange, transacted a total of 67.5 million trades since the release of the first version of the protocol in 2018, according to data compiled Coin Metrics.  However, daily trades peaked around 271,0000 during the May 2021 crypto sell-off. Since May, trades on Uniswap have fallen to around 100,000 per day.  ‚ÄúRecently, there have been ~30,000 unique addresses transacting daily, and to date Uniswap has been one of the most popular dapps on Ethereum,‚Äù Coin Metrics wrote in a Tuesday newsletter.  Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported that regulators are investigating Uniswap Labs after U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler stated that DeFi projects are not immune to regulations.  Despite regulatory risk and the decline in trading activity over the past few months, some analysts see long-term potential for DeFi exchanges (DEXs).  ‚ÄúPowered by the proliferation of new tokens, composable DeFi protocols, and an ever-increasing user base, DEXs are gaining a formidable share of total crypto asset trading volume,‚Äù Coin Metrics wrote.  Altcoin roundup  Aave proposal enlists Fireblocks to aid DeFi protocol‚Äôs mainstream finance push: In a proposal on Aave‚Äôs decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance forum on Monday morning, user ‚Äúsalmanblocks‚Äù called for adding Fireblocks as the first whitelister on the compliant implementation of Aave, reported CoinDesk‚Äôs Andrew Thurman. Rob Salman, the head of business development for Fireblocks, submitted the proposal on behalf of the company, a spokesperson told CoinDesk. Whitelisters would ensure that users of these permissioned lending pools comply with relevant laws depending on the user‚Äôs jurisdiction. Until now, the permissionless nature of DeFi, where lenders do not know to whom they‚Äôre lending , has been a key blocker for corporate legal teams.  Stablecoin pegged to Peru‚Äôs currency, the sol, launches on Stellar: Latin American digital token issuer Anclap launched the stablecoin, which is 100% backed by local currency, reported CoinDesk‚Äôs Jamie Crawley.

42376110,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwETYx,1632861647,Kraken to Pay $1.25M Fine After Settling Charges With CFTC,"Kraken will pay $1.25 million to settle charges with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that it offered illegal margined digital asset transaction services and did not register as a futures commodity merchant (FCM) with the regulatory agency.  The CFTC found Kraken violated the Commodities Exchange Act by offering margined crypto products between June 2020 and June 2021 without registering as either a Designated Contract Market (DCM) or FCM. Entities hoping to list or trade futures products must register as an FCM, while a DCM license is needed to offer futures products.  Kraken maintained sole custody of the margined assets, according to a CFTC press release.  ‚ÄúDuring the relevant period, Kraken offered potential and existing U.S. customers the ability to enter into margined retail commodity transactions on its exchange,‚Äù an order issued by the CFTC said. ‚ÄúMargined trading was available to any U.S. person who Kraken approved for a user account.‚Äù  The exchange offered margin ratios of up to 5:1, according to the order.  Under the terms of the settlement, Kraken will pay the $1.25 million fine within 30 days and cease offering this type of margin to U.S. persons. The exchange is also waiving its right to any hearings or court review.  CFTC Commissioner Dawn Stump announced in a concurring statement that it may be difficult for Kraken to comply with the law given the current guidance around issues like ‚Äúactual delivery‚Äù of digital assets.  Stump said it was unclear how Kraken could be regulated as an FCM, noting that it would be ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù for a company to be registered as a DCM and FCM at once. Kraken is not registered as either, according to the NFA database.  ‚ÄúHow Kraken would be regulated as an FCM is not entirely clear, because many of the Commission‚Äôs rules governing its regulation of traditional FCMs do not fit Kraken‚Äôs role as an exchange,‚Äù she said.  The Commissioner proposed opening up a rule-making procedure to provide clear ‚Äúrules of the road‚Äù for exchanges and other crypto entities to abide by.  In a statement, a Kraken spokesperson said, ‚ÄúWe appreciate that today‚Äôs settlement acknowledges our cooperation and engagement on the issue. We are committed to working with regulators to try to ensure the rules governing digital assets create a level playing field globally ‚Äì one that allows the crypto space in the U.S. to flourish, while protecting the interests of individuals and the integrity of the industry.‚Äù  Kraken ‚Äúsought clarity‚Äù around the CFTC‚Äôs margin trading guidance and began proactively limiting its margin products in June 2021, the statement said.  ‚ÄúAs Commissioner Stump recognizes in her concurrence, this enforcement action comes in the absence of a clearly articulated path to offering margin spot products to retail investors. We believe that such a path would benefit the U.S. digital asset industry and U.S. investors writ large. Kraken looks forward to engaging productively on these issues in the future,‚Äù the statement said.  Zack Seward contributed reporting.

CleanSpark has added 1 exahash per second (EH/s) of computing power, generated by 10,000 of the latest-generation bitcoin mining machines, to the Foundry USA Pool. The company plans to continue with machine deployments to reach its goal of 2 EH/s by the end of 2021 and 3 EH/s by fall 2022.  The USA Pool of Foundry, a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group (DCG), focuses on institutional mining businesses and integrates with cryptocurrency prime broker Genesis, another DCG-owned company, to provide treasury management services. Foundry USA is the first North American pool to offer the Full Pay Per Share (FPPS) payout method without relying on an external party. FPPS pays miners the expected block reward from bitcoin plus the associated transaction fees. In return, the pool operator is paid a small fee. Foundry USA‚Äôs major customers include Bit Digital, Hive, Greenidge Generation Holdings and Foundry itself.  ‚ÄúMining pools historically have not been as transparent in the way they calculate their miners‚Äô earnings,‚Äù said Bernardo Schucman, senior vice president of mining for CleanSpark, in a press release. ‚ÄúFoundry USA Pool is an exception, however.

Gro was launched by Graah in 2020 and received $7.1 million in seed funding from Galaxy Digital, Framework Ventures and Northzone. The firm runs protocols aiming to give users a simple DeFi experience.  The firm has also appointed Jake Chervinsky the general counsel at Compound Labs, as a strategic adviser at Gro.  Graah told CoinDesk the xGRO governance token will be used for on-chain voting ahead of its liquidity mining program for users of the protocol‚Äôs two main products ‚Äì the Gro PWRD and Vault.  Graah said the xGRO token was distributed to members of the Gro decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which includes early users and the Gro team, and early-seed investors. DAOs, whose decisions are carried out by software rather than human managers, and governance tokens play an important role in the execution of DeFi.  Two million GRO tokens (2% of the total) will be distributed as community incentives during the first month. Liquidity mining, where users earn an additional token on top of the regularly expected yield just for putting assets into a funding pool, will be starting Friday with four incentivized staking pools.  ‚ÄúUsing two tokens allowed the community itself to launch the DAO,‚Äù said Graah. ‚ÄúNeither VCs nor team took part in the DAO establishment votes, so it was really driven by the community.‚Äù  Read more: Users Celebrate Massive DYDX Token Airdrop as Transfer Restrictions Lift",POSITIVE,DYDX,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | DYDX | AIRDROP,Tanzeel Akhtar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/28/ex-revolut-exec-launches-governance-token-with-backing-from-galaxy-digital,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c15498d763e037e7dc1ccbf5407766e790b52f64-1024x711.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Monday morning, reports emerged that decentralized finance (DeFi) trading platform DeversiFi had somehow ‚Äúfat-fingered‚Äù $23 million by spending an unusually high transaction fee on a simple ERC-20 token swap that should have cost $5.  While initial reports pointed to Bitfinex as the victim, DeversiFi claimed the error as its own.  ‚ÄúIn transactions such as these, the fees are shouldered by third-party integrations with Bitfinex. This has also been confirmed by DeversiFi in their recent tweet,‚Äù Bitfinex wrote in a statement to CoinDesk.  In a surprise twist, however, on Monday night DeversiFi said in a tweet that the miner who received the unusual transaction fee had returned the majority of the funds ‚Äì an unusually altruistic move, given that due to the nature of the blockchain the miner could have kept the funds, and it‚Äôs unlikely any legal proceedings could have compelled them to return them.  In a post-mortem blog post on Tuesday, DeversiFi said that the funds were sent in an error caused by a fee calculation flub in how the EthereumJS library processes decimals.  The team also said it worked with hardware wallet provider Ledger on a bug patch, and that the bug could only apply to large wallets such as theirs.  How to retrieve $23 million  While working on discovering the cause, the DeversiFi team said it reached out to Binance. The miner‚Äôs address continually routes funds to the centralized exchange, presumably to sell mined ETH.  Binance agreed to give the miner DeversiFi‚Äôs contact information, and the miner agreed to return the funds ‚Äúafter a few emails back and forth.‚Äù  DeversiFi pushed for the miner to keep 50 ETH, or $140,000 at the time of writing, as a reward.  The team also wrote that DeversiFi has implemented ‚Äúadditional safety and sanity checks‚Äù to ‚Äúensure gas fees associated with transactions could not exceed unrealistic thresholds.‚Äù The new checks aim to ‚Äúprotect against user error, extreme network fee spikes‚Äù and serve as ‚Äúan additional layer of protection against any future coding error.‚Äù",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/28/an-update-on-the-erroneously-high-gas-fee-that-temporarily-cost-deversifi-237m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a0c2ade586cdac67c2f84adab5faefc41cda8c38-4928x3264.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Whales Have Started Selling Their Coins As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, the Bitcoin whale ratio has started going up above the 0.50 level. This signal has usually meant a bearish outlook for the crypto in the short term. The BTC all exchanges whale ratio is an indicator that gives an estimation of how many whales are sending their coins to exchanges. The metric does so by taking the sum of the top 10 transactions to each exchange and dividing it with the total inflow on all exchanges. Exchange Whale Ratio= Sum of Top 10 Exchange Inflow TXs (BTC) √∑ Total Exchange Inflows in BTC‚Äã The &apos;inflow&apos; is another indicator, it gives the total amount of Bitcoin entering into exchange wallets from personal ones. When the whale ratio rises, it means the top 10 transactions to exchanges are taking up a larger part of the total BTC going into these exchanges. This means more whales have started sending their coins to exchanges, either for withdrawing to fiat or stablecoins, or for purchasing altcoins. On the other hand, when the value moves down, it means the general small transactions make up the majority of the inflows to exchanges, and that Bitcoin whales aren&apos;t moving their coins around at this time.

These upward cryptographic movements would explain why over 16 percent of international transfers in the United States have disappeared. The country has established a mark on these crypto transactions, sending at least 76,000 each year. Research on crypto remittances The PYMNTS organization has investigated crypto remittances on the rise within countries like the United States and Nigeria. Based on the data collected, over 50 percent of the people who use these global transfers store cryptocurrencies. This is a huge figure compared to the 12 percent of people in North America who have no ties to cryptos. The researchers also verified that crypto remittances rose after the Covid 19 pandemic arrived. This occurs because crypto transactions have cheaper fees compared to fiat currency transfers. But cryptocurrencies are being accepted as a payment method in several countries worldwide without being questioned.

Immense pressure from Chinese central banks following the latest iteration of the China crypto ban has seen exchanges suspending operations in the region. In light of this, large amounts of crypto are being moved from exchange wallets to presumably safer wallets. The transactions are thought to be going to cold wallet storage. Crypto crackdowns in the country caused a surge in USDT sell-offs against the Yuan as users tried to get rid of their crypto holdings before the ban takes full effect.

Two sources are responsible for buying machines at major mining pools, while a third source has worked extensively with Chinese miners. They all asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to discuss the move publicly.  The privately owned Bitmain will also move the majority of its production out of Shenzhen in southern China and into other countries to comply with the latest mandates on crypto issued by the country‚Äôs central bank last week, all three sources said.  Bitmain did not respond to multiple requests for comment before press time.  The People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC) toughened its stance on crypto trading last week, making all crypto-related transactions illegal. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which has been a popular marketplace for the sale of mining machines, announced it was suspending all such sales starting on Oct. 8.  Chinese Ethereum mining pool operator SparkPool, which is the second-largest contributor to Ethereum‚Äôs entire network, said on Monday it will shut off all its services at home and abroad by the end of this month. And at least 18 platforms providing services related to crypto have either announced they are exiting the market in China or are now inaccessible, Chinese media reported Tuesday.  Founded in 2013, Bitmain was one of the earliest manufacturing companies to make an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), which is a powerful, specialized machine for bitcoin mining. ASICs have enabled miners to scale up their mining operations and increased mining difficulty exponentially.  Bitmain has secured Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) as its supplier of advanced computer chips, which is a major bottleneck for crypto mining-hardware manufacturers looking to make machines.  The company completed its year-long process in July to spin off its mining pool services unit Antpool and prepare for an initial public offering.

42394421,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdDth,1632847290,"You Can Be a Bitcoin Maximalist and Like Ethereum, Too","Toxic bitcoin maximalism has been in the spotlight. For the past few days noted bitcoin booster Udi Wertheimer has been kicking the cyber hornet‚Äôs nest, challenging a non-dominant opinion in some of the online spaces bitcoiners congregate that bitcoin is the one, true crypto asset.  ‚Äú[K]nowingly pushing people away from bitcoin [in] the short term is, in udiverse‚Äôs opinion, highly immoral. gatekeeping is not a virtue,‚Äù Wertheimer said on Twitter, referring to himself as udiverse. He‚Äôs been on a tear, questioning the immune-like response bitcoiners activate when anyone denigrates ‚Äúthe coin‚Äù or mentions other cool crypto things happening on other chains. Everything ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù ‚Äì that is non-bitcoin ‚Äì is a scam; everyone who sees value elsewhere is a scammer.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk‚Äôs daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Not to call anyone out in particular, but here‚Äôs a good example of a bitcoin influencer turning on Nayib Bukele, the ‚ÄúTrojan horse‚Äù presidente of El Salvador who pushed through legislation putting BTC on equal footing with the U.S. dollar, for experimenting with TRON. ‚ÄúIdiot!‚Äù  Bitcoin toxicity may seem like a trivial issue. That this battle is being taken up by someone who talks in the third person as some sort of cartoon platypus speaks to the absurdity. The internet is not ‚Äúreal life.‚Äù Twitter‚Äôs infinite scroll is infinitely dumb. But at the same time, udiverse ‚Äì the troll of trolls ‚Äì has a point.  Many a public figure has been chastised for stating views counter to the bitcoin mindset ‚Äì sometimes pushing them out of the fold. Best-selling author Nassim Taleb has been savaged (though he may have been asking for it), as have figures like the lovable Neeraj Agrawal. Some folks, like Bloomberg editor Joe Weisenthal, playfully engage the beast. But for many, being dogpiled by ‚Äúmaximalists‚Äù is an unnerving experience.  As bitcoin continues to gain prominence in the global economy and activity on the internet, it has also become central to some people‚Äôs sense of identity. Bitcoin is not just an asset to hold but a movement in which you participate. Extreme fanaticism conflates perceived attacks on the Bitcoin network to one‚Äôs sense of self. It also allows no quarter to people who haven‚Äôt yet ‚Äúgrokked‚Äù bitcoin, or may be troubled by its effects on the world.  Read more: The Node: I Don‚Äôt Understand Bitcoin Maximalism | The Node  As Wertheimer argues, the case for coin tribalism is wearing thin. In his reading, maximalism as we know it today took root in 2017, when the bitcoin community was divided over the question of block size. This was a mostly technical debate about changing a few narrow parameters of the Bitcoin source code, but it was at heart an argument about what Bitcoin is. Should developers pursue a ‚Äúdigital cash‚Äù system, or is bitcoin ‚Äúdigital gold?‚Äù  Those who took the former position and wanted more transactions per second, making BTC more usable money, they reckoned, were deemed bad actors. (There were legitimate concerns about increasing the block size: Bigger blocks would diminish the fee economy; true scalability would likely require layer 2 systems regardless of block size; perhaps most importantly, bigger blocks would make it harder to run a node, thereby diminishing Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralization.) Many former insiders were cast aside.  I‚Äôm a subscriber to the idea that Bitcoin is something of a ‚ÄúProtestant reformation‚Äù in the history of money ‚Äì stripping financial control from technocrats and empowering individuals to pursue their own path ‚Äì and think ‚Äúbitcoin maximalism‚Äù could justifiably be described as a puritanical turn. Bitcoin became a mind colony. Ideas about bitcoin hardened, the scope of acceptable debates shrunk and everyone slightly heterodox was now a heathen. Leaving aside the heavenly visions of hyperbitcoinization, much of this unfolded in good faith.  ‚Äú[S]eparatism used to be a fitting response, e.g., in 2017, when actual bad actors tried to hurt the movement,‚Äù Wertheimer said. ‚Äú[H]owever, 2021 is different, the new crowds aren‚Äôt trying to hurt anyone, and separatism doesn‚Äôt achieve the stated goal of ‚Äòeducating‚Äô anyone.‚Äù (Wertheimer did not respond to a request for comment.)  Wertheimer isn‚Äôt the only hardcore bitcoiner to soften his views. Eric Wall, a researcher and chief investor for Arcane Assets, has also recently begun striking out against toxic maximalism. Wall and I spoke earlier this month about how identities form in the crypto industry, what value they provide and the possibility of changing your mind. His is a story of personal transformation, but it‚Äôs not about any single individual‚Äôs beliefs ‚Äì not Wertheimer‚Äôs or Wall‚Äôs ‚Äì but about community orientation. It applies also to other forms of blockchain maximalism.  The strongest case for bitcoin supremacy is made by those who want bitcoin to succeed in becoming a universally accepted scarce asset.  ‚ÄúIn order for bitcoin to compete as this store of value, we need to make sure that it stays the number one asset. If Bitcoin gets replaced by Ethereum, and then Ethereum gets replaced by Solana [and that] gets replaced by whatever the next smart contract platform or cryptocurrency is, then it‚Äôs going to be very hard to make the case that we‚Äôve actually invented digital gold,‚Äù Wall said over Zoom.  That‚Äôs a position Wall will fight for ‚Äúuntil my last dying breath.‚Äù But creating an ‚Äúalternative to the fiat money we have‚Äù does not preclude the success of other blockchain-based applications or tools.  Wall is a thorough if sometimes uncouth researcher. By his own account, he has made enemies of every coin camp ‚Äì being labeled a Cardano, Ethereum and Bitcoin maximalist ‚Äì for asking tough questions about each chain. For years, he had been skeptical of Ethereum and believed that in time, through scaling solutions, Bitcoin could achieve the same functionality as the so-called ‚Äúworld computer.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI used to believe that Bitcoin should be the base layer of everything and we should just build layer 2 solutions on top ‚Ä¶ to add flexibility,‚Äù Wall said. Looking a little closer, however, Wall discovered that these add-ons failed to live up to their expectations. All, excluding the Lightning Network, reintroduced the problem of ‚Äútrust‚Äù that Bitcoin had solved (allowing parties to interact without an intermediary).  Read more: Why Hardnosed Bitcoiners Can Learn to Love DeFi | Matt Luongo  That wasn‚Äôt the case for Ethereum, which has suffered from its own expansion issues but found ‚Äúflexible,‚Äù ‚Äúfeature rich‚Äù and ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù solutions like rollups. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something that made me start to change my position on whether or not bitcoin was the only asset that had a role to play in the cryptocurrency ecosystem,‚Äù Wall said. Blockchains can be complementary systems, he said.  This position, both financial and ideological, put him ‚Äúat odds‚Äù with some bitcoiners. When asked why that is, Wall said that sometimes when people invest in a blockchain‚Äôs promises, ‚Äúthey feel as if they have no way of backing out or changing their mind in light of new information or evidence.‚Äù  But crypto markets are open 24/7, and markets account for all available information.  ‚ÄúWhen I realized this, the only thing that I had to do was to buy some ether [the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain] to be in alignment with my beliefs,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm not afraid of ether becoming successful.‚Äù",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/28/you-can-be-a-bitcoin-maximalist-and-like-ethereum-too,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf981c4a82df14d05a411616c26deea73234ecb6-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But the company said it is also taking into account the ‚Äúinstability of laws and regulations‚Äù on crypto around the world.  Alibaba will shut down two categories: ‚ÄúBlockchain Miner Accessories‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlockchain Miners.‚Äù  The e-commerce giant said that in addition to a ban on mining rigs and related accessories, it is also pursuing a prohibition on the sale of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, litecoin, beaocoin, quarkcoin, and ether.  Any merchants that list such products on its platforms after Oct. 15 will face penalties.  Alibaba operates several platforms in China, including Taobao and used goods marketplace Xianyu. But it is also the group behind international online shopping platforms including Aliexpress and Southeast Asia‚Äôs Lazada.  China‚Äôs crackdown on crypto mining and trading started in May after a State Council statement, but it was mostly left up to provincial and city authorities, with no publicly available comprehensive policy plan. Friday‚Äôs policy guidelines leave no room for interpretation, outlawing all crypto transactions and clarifying that mining is to be eliminated.

42394431,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdEtF,1632844395,"Crypto Regulation, Ransomware and OFAC‚Äôs Rise","The U.S. government sanctioned a crypto exchange for the first time last week, escalating its fight against ransomware and proclaiming that crypto regulation will not be free of enforcement actions.  The other major storyline last week came from China, which once again announced it was taking on crypto activities, this time banning transactions and raising the possibility of criminal penalties. My colleague Muyao Shen explores this issue and what the broader lessons may be for the crypto regulation landscape.  You‚Äôre reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  OFAC ramps up crypto regulation  The narrative  The Treasury Department‚Äôs Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) is taking on the ransomware fight, sanctioning a crypto exchange for the first time.  Why it matters  OFAC‚Äôs role in the ransomware fight is interesting. It‚Äôs a sanctions enforcer, not a cyber watchdog. While it makes sense that the agency has a role in trying to mitigate the ransomware crisis, the fact it‚Äôs involved in the most public action against ransomware to date may actually reinforce one of the core ideas within the crypto sector: that intermediaries are points of failure.  Breaking it down  Last week, the OFAC blacklisted a crypto exchange for the first time on allegations it facilitated bitcoin transactions for ransomware actors. Suex, an exchange that claims to operate out of the Czech Republic but with offices in a handful of Russian cities, became the latest crypto entity to join the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list on Tuesday.  It‚Äôs the first formal action the U.S. government has taken in its fight against ransomware under the current administration, though Treasury has sanctioned people for facilitating cryptocurrency transactions on behalf of ransomware attackers in the past.  It‚Äôs also the first time a crypto exchange has landed in OFAC‚Äôs crosshairs.  Treasury officials did not respond to a set of questions about the action or the exchange.  ‚ÄúTreasury is announcing that we will now also be taking steps to obstruct and deter these criminals by going after their financial enablers,‚Äù Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a press call previewing the action. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs action is a signal of our intention to expose and disrupt the illicit infrastructure used in these attacks.‚Äù  Suex was a nested exchange, Adeyemo said, which blog posts from TRM Labs and Chainalysis described as an exchange that doesn‚Äôt operate its own custody service but uses a larger exchange to tap into its liquidity and market-making abilities.  In this case, Binance appears to be one of these larger exchanges. CEO Changpeng Zhao said Suex accounts were ‚Äúde-platformed‚Äù based on analysis of the 25 crypto addresses included in last week‚Äôs action.  There are a number of details about this action that really stood out to me. First, while the TRM and Chainalysis blog posts identified a handful of Suex‚Äôs employees and described their operations, OFAC did not add any of these individuals to its SDN list.  In contrast, when OFAC sanctioned alleged North Korean hackers, alleged Chinese drug traffickers or alleged Iranian crypto transmitters, the enforcer named the specific individuals involved in the illicit activities.  That hasn‚Äôt stopped Suex founder Egor Petukhovsky from saying he‚Äôll take on the U.S. government in court. He wrote on Facebook that none of his business entities engaged in illegal activity.  Still, regardless of whether Petukhovsky or the rest of the Suex team knew what transactions they were facilitating, the fact that reportedly around 40% of Suex‚Äôs transactions went to known addresses tied to malicious actors may be enough for the U.S. government.  It‚Äôs also interesting to me that OFAC swung what appears to be one of the first offensive blows against ransomware attackers. We‚Äôve known for a while that actions against crypto exchanges were on the table ‚Äì officials have been warning about this for months now ‚Äì but I wasn‚Äôt able to find a comparable action by the Department of Homeland Security, for example.  Past precedent?  The closest I could find are rumors the U.S. government may have been involved in the REvil ransomware group going offline, but nothing definitive.  While I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs activity that isn‚Äôt publicized, the lesson seems to be that financial intermediaries may be among the easiest targets for regulators tamping down on illicit behavior.  This is obvious to those of you who have spent any length of time in the crypto industry, but it‚Äôs worth re-examining this through the lens of OFAC‚Äôs action and ransomware attacks more broadly.  OFAC didn‚Äôt sanction the final recipients of these transactions (yet), just like it doesn‚Äôt seem to have sanctioned the final recipients in its first crypto action in 2018. The names on the SDN list belong to those charged with facilitating crypto transfers for ransomware attackers.  Of course, OFAC did sanction the individuals who received (or took) crypto in some of its other actions, including the aforementioned drug runners and hackers.  Griffith‚Äôs plea  Another major headline hit the wires yesterday after Virgil Griffith, the one-time Ethereum Foundation developer arrested in 2019 on one count of conspiracy to violate the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA), pleaded guilty in an agreement that could see him face around five to seven years in prison, rather than the 20-year maximum sentence prosecutors mentioned in press releases.  Once again, this was an OFAC story: Griffith allegedly explained how to use cryptocurrencies to a North Korean audience and may have even attempted to transfer money between North Korea and another nation (which a member of the ACJR Telegram group says was rumored to be one gwei, i.e., a tiny fraction of one ETH).  Looking ahead, Adeyemo mentioned crypto mixers three times in the press call last week. No specific details were provided at the time, but there are ongoing cases against bitcoin mixing service providers, which may ultimately serve as precedents.  Not just another Chinese crypto ban  Guest essay by CoinDesk markets reporter Muyao Shen.  Rumors were circulating for weeks before the latest crypto trading ban in China finally arrived last Friday.  For a glass-half-full crypto investor in China, the good news is the message, co-signed by 10 agencies, did not indicate that the possession of crypto is illegal.  But that may also be the only positive takeaway from the ban.  The Sept. 24 notice was more than just another piece of ‚ÄúChina FUD‚Äù because it addressed many crypto-related activities that were previously in the gray zone of regulation.  Multi-agency efforts  China‚Äôs determination to ban crypto trading activity is unparalleled this time: The notice was co-signed by 10 agencies including the three main bodies of China‚Äôs judicial system: the Supreme People‚Äôs Court (SPC), Supreme People‚Äôs Procuratorate (SPP) and Public Security Bureau (PSB).  Crypto trading activity involves ‚Äúlegal risks‚Äù and ‚Äúany legal person, unincorporated organization or natural person‚Äù who is investing in virtual currency and related derivatives violates ‚Äúpublic order and good customs,‚Äù according to the notice.  Not just bitcoin  For the first time, the ban made it clear that China forbids transactions from one crypto to another. Previously, China only banned banks and other financial institutions from offering services related to crypto transactions of fiat to crypto. The ban also first named cryptocurrencies outside bitcoin.  ‚ÄúBitcoin, ether, tether and other virtual currencies have the main characteristics of being issued by non-monetary authorities, using encryption technology, distributed accounts or other similar technologies, and exist in digital forms,‚Äù the notice said. ‚ÄúThey are not legal, and should not and cannot be circulated as currency on the market.‚Äù  Ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, just behind bitcoin. Tether, the dollar-pegged stablecoin, is one of the most popular stablecoins among Chinese traders, who routinely use the stablecoin as an on-ramp to crypto markets because fiat-to-crypto trading was already banned.  It is worth noting that after months of rumors, Tether Ltd., the company behind the tether stablecoin, denied it holds any commercial paper or other debt or securities issued by Chinese property giant Evergrande Group, which is facing a deepening liquidity crisis.  With the latest ban, there is also new speculation that as the East Asian country injects capital into the market to save the troubled real estate developer, it has also elevated bans on crypto trading to curtail potential capital flights via crypto.  Offshore exchanges and other crypto platforms  The notice also warned those who live in China but work for off-shore crypto exchanges facilitating crypto-related trades are subject to legal prosecution, a clarification in one of the most significant parts of the gray area of crypto in China.  Since 2017‚Ä≤s ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs), many Chinese crypto exchanges, including Binance, Huobi and OKEx, moved out or claimed to have moved out of the country amid crackdowns, yet many have remained popular among Chinese users, who rely on virtual private networks (VPNs) to participate in crypto-related activities.  Within the latest crackdown, many crypto firms have already started taking action: Huobi, for example, has halted new customer registrations in China and will retire all its mainland Chinese users by Dec. 31, 2021.  ‚ÄúWe believe that this latest announcement jointly issued by the People‚Äôs Bank of China and other Chinese regulatory authorities should be observed and their requirements should also be strictly implemented,‚Äù Du Jun, co-founder of Huobi Group, said in an email response to CoinDesk.  ‚ÄúDue to historical reasons, we do have a certain proportion of our user base in mainland China,‚Äù he added, acknowledging that Huobi‚Äôs decision to retire all users from China will ‚Äúhave a certain impact on the company‚Äôs revenue in the short term.‚Äù  Both Binance and OKEx, however, sent out similar responses, which denied their business operations in China, according to Chinese crypto media Blockchain News Daily and influencer Colin Wu on Twitter.  Biden‚Äôs rule  Changing of the guard  U.S. President Joe Biden has nominated Cornell University Law Professor Saule Omarova to be the next Comptroller of the Currency. And, as I noted last week, once again we have a nominee who is familiar with crypto, to the point where she‚Äôs written papers about the subject.  Elsewhere:  Ethereum Developer Virgil Griffith Pleads Guilty to Conspiracy Charge in North Korea Sanctions Case: Virgil Griffith, who was arrested in 2019 on one count of conspiracy to violate the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, pleaded guilty on Monday. CoinDesk‚Äôs Cheyenne Ligon reports that he could face between 63 and 78 months in prison under an agreement with prosecutors.  SEC Hints at Tether Probe in Records Request Denial: This could be nothing, but somewhere between February and September 2021 the Securities and Exchange Commission began probing Tether. Worth noting: Chair Gary Gensler first said in July that some stablecoins may be securities in the SEC‚Äôs view.  Leaked Slides Show How Chainalysis Flags Crypto Suspects for Cops: Crypto forensics firm Chainalysis set up a block explorer to essentially act as a honeypot ‚Äì it scrapes the explorer‚Äôs users‚Äô IP addresses ‚Äì according to a set of slides leaked online.  Revolut to Launch Crypto Token: Sources: CoinDesk scoopmeister Ian Allison reports that fintech startup Revolut is looking into launching its own native token.  Beyond CoinDesk:  (Associated Press) Far-right nationalists are using crypto to fundraise, and squirrel these funds away from governments and legal judgments, the AP reports. I‚Äôm guessing this investigation has its origins in crypto‚Äôs use during the January insurrection attempt at the U.S. Capitol ‚Äì crypto by extremists was a major talking point, and likely a solid jumping-off point for further investigations. This report is worth a look.  (The Washington Post) SEC Chair Gary Gensler spoke to the Washington Post last week about cryptocurrency issues, and the Post was kind enough to publish the full transcript. The most interesting line, to me, was when Gensler said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think technologies long last outside of a social and public policy framework‚Äù in the context of bitcoin and fintech.  (Canadian Securities Administrators) A joint notice by the Canadian Securities Administrators and Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada details how these regulators view marketing activities by crypto exchanges. Canadian regulators have learned a lot since QuadrigaCX, and preemptive action seems to be the new modus operandi.

42376104,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwETVB,1632844230,Ethereum Developer Virgil Griffith Pleads Guilty to Conspiracy Charge in North Korea Sanctions Case,"Virgil Griffith, the Ethereum developer charged with violating U.S. sanctions law, has pleaded guilty in an agreement with federal prosecutors.  Griffith pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act on Monday in a New York courthouse. The plea deal could see him serve between 63 and 78 months in prison. He will be sentenced in January 2022.  Brian Klein, Griffith‚Äôs attorney, said in a statement, ‚ÄúVirgil is deeply remorseful. Setting aside what happened, he has made important contributions to society that we will raise with the court. He also has many wonderful qualities, and no one should define him by this mistake.‚Äù  The developer was arrested in November 2019 after giving a presentation on cryptocurrency and blockchain at a North Korean cryptocurrency conference in April that yearHe also agreed to a forfeiture clause, though details were not released at press time. A 2019 charging document calls for the forfeiture of any proceeds Griffith earned from giving the presentation.  While Griffith was originally released on bail in 2020, he is currently in jail on allegations of trying to violate his bail conditions. Griffith tried to access his Coinbase holdings to pay his attorneys earlier this summer, which prosecutors said violated the terms of his agreement.  After entering a guilty plea, Griffith‚Äôs lawyers requested he be moved from Metropolitan Correctional Center to Essex County Correctional Facility in Newark, N.J., citing ‚Äúvery difficult‚Äù conditions at MCC, which is known for being dilapidated and dangerous for inmates.  Griffith, known for his normally bright and gregarious personality, was somber and emotional in court. When asked by the judge how he was feeling, Griffith said he had been doing daily ‚Äúmeditational training‚Äù and and was ‚Äúacutely aware of how awful [he was] feeling.‚Äù  IEEPA charge  He was charged with violating a pair of executive orders that prohibit some types of transactions and activities in North Korea, including exporting services by U.S. persons. As a U.S. citizen, Griffith qualifies as a U.S. person, though his primary residence was in Singapore before his arrest.  At the center of the allegations was a presentation Griffith gave to the North Korean conference. While the specifics of the presentation have not been released, attorneys who commented on the case noted that much of the material may have already been public.  However, that may not have mattered for the prosecution.  Monday‚Äôs agreement caps off nearly two years of legal back-and-forth between attorneys for the prosecution and Griffith. Defense attorneys repeatedly requested clarity about the charges being brought, according to public filings.  Griffith‚Äôs plea deal came as a surprise, as both prosecutors and Griffith‚Äôs defense team have been preparing for a trial. A jury was finalized Monday morning.  Documents filed in the case indicate that the decision to reach a plea agreement was reached over the weekend.  UPDATE (Sept. 27, 2021, 15:30 UTC): Updated with additional context.

42376117,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwETlX,1632843424,Connext Launches NXTP Protocol to Improve Liquidity,"Connext, a platform based on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to conduct transactions across different Ethereum-compatible networks, announced the launch of NXTP, a tool that allows communication between different blockchains and their offshoots, known as layer 2 systems and sidechains.  The launch comes two months after Connext raised $12 million in a funding round.  Ethereum‚Äôs capacity, or scalability, issues have prompted software developers to move their applications to layer 2 networks from the main Ethereum network, which is known as a mainnet, or a layer 1 system. The result is that users are interacting more with a mix of layer 2 networks that are built on top of Ethereum, sidechains and layer 1 networks that are compatible with Ethereum.  The Connext network consists of a set of ‚Äúnodes,‚Äù or people with routers who support the network and provide liquidity to it. The nodes pass data between the systems, earning fees in the process. The company launched its Vector protocol early this year, but that had difficulty handling transactions because of the complicated accounting those transactions required. NXTP was rolled out to fix those issues and boost the liquidity that‚Äôs needed to attract developers to the platform.  The growing field of ‚Äúcross-chain interoperability‚Äù networks also includes Hermez, Loopring and StarkEx. Connext says one big advantage of NXTP is that it doesn‚Äôt introduce third-party validators to control user funds, which can pose a security risk.  Founded in 2017, Connext has now completed over $500 million in transactions across its network, according to the company. The $12 million funding round in July was co-led by investment firm 1kx and blockchain technology company ConsenSys and included more than 80 additional investors.  ‚ÄúOur vision for NXTP is that it will become the internet protocol of the Ethereum multi-chain ecosystem,‚Äù Connext founder Arjun Bhuptani said in a press release, ‚ÄúNow that it‚Äôs live, our focus will be on growing liquidity within the system, rapidly adding support for new chains/L2s, and transitioning the protocol to becoming entirely owned and operated by the community.‚Äù  In an interview with CoinDesk, Bhuptani laid out the company‚Äôs plans to increase liquidity. Bhuptani noted that the funding round in July included blockchain infrastructure providers like Stakefish that are capable of providing liquidity and have ‚Äúgreat reputations in that space.‚Äù  Connext also has a pipeline of about 260 more people who have signed up to operate routers.  ‚ÄúThe goal is to head towards making it as passive as possible to provide liquidity to the system,‚Äù Bhuptani said.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LRC | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/28/connext-launches-nxtp-protocol-to-improve-liquidity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9333f4ed31f32c0c9c3bbe661a4fa1eb9d9ba2c4-1500x1500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Also included in the seed round, announced Tuesday, were Fabric VC, Wintermute, Divergence Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Alven, Julien Bouteloup and Fr√©d√©ric Montagnon.  Angle‚Äôs euro stablecoin, which is underpinned by crypto-generating perpetual swaps, satisfies a pressing need across the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) universe, says Angle Labs core contributor Pablo Veyrat.  Because of the U.S. dollar‚Äôs depreciation in 2020, people from Europe have to make at least a 10% return on their USD-pegged stablecoins to make a profit in euros, Veyrat pointed out.  ‚ÄúI started working on the project in January while at Stanford and having fun with Compound getting some yield on USDC. But I‚Äôm based in France, and I realized that I was subject to [exchange] risk with my USDC,‚Äù said Veyrat in an interview.  The project‚Äôs agEUR stablecoin on Ethereum is currently on testnet, or being tested, while the mainnet code is being audited and is expected to go live by the end of next month.  The plan is also to launch a USD stablecoin using the protocol, and then to offer fiat stablecoins for other regions heavily involved in DeFi but underserved in terms of stablecoins, including the Swiss franc, the British pound, the Japanese yen or the Korean won.  Stablecoin race  A new generation of stablecoin developers are exploring alternatives to U.S. dollar-pegged coins that rely on dollars held one-to-one in a bank account, or capital-inefficient ‚Äúalgocoins‚Äù that require over-collateralization.  Stablecoins are emerging backed using derivatives techniques like perpetual swaps and delta-neutral positions (a hedging strategy that balances the degree to which an option is exposed to shifts in the price of the underlying asset). A recent example is the Solana-based UXD stablecoin protocol.  Read more: UXD Raises $3M to Bring Algorithmic Stablecoins to Solana  ‚ÄúWe have an insurance fund because the protocol accumulates some surplus,‚Äù Veyrat said. ‚ÄúBut we also have the people who lend money to us, to whom we can offer a higher yield. These people are our insurance fund. So from a stablecoin point of view, we are like UXD on steroids.‚Äù  Veyrat acknowledged that the size of a euro stablecoin market is a mere fraction of the billions worth of transactions denominated in USD stablecoins. But he expects further depreciation of the dollar going forward.  ‚ÄúIt looks like the Biden administration is spending a lot of money,‚Äù Veyrat said. ‚ÄúSo there‚Äôs going to be a lot of inflation in USD in the coming years, I feel.‚Äù  Being able to tackle the exchange risk between currencies raises the question of how such a protocol could help people in countries dogged by unstable currencies and hyperinflation.  ‚ÄúObviously there‚Äôs a huge motivation to give financial access to people who are deprived of stable currencies, like in Zimbabwe or Venezuela,‚Äù said Veyrat, adding:  ‚ÄúBut when it comes to people playing with DeFi, you need to talk to degens. When you‚Äôre launching your protocol, there is no success otherwise; DeFi only exists within itself for the moment.‚Äù",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | USDC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/28/andreessen-horowitz-leads-5m-bet-on-euro-stablecoin-startup-angle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/231595d99de414c51af437e9cf3387f262003a40-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Zoracles has developed an on-chain solution called the Zora Score to calculate the creditworthiness of an Ethereum wallet based on factors such as the age of the wallet, DeFi activity, and loan repayment. Credit scores are standard in traditional finance and are necessary for making and issuing loans. Zoracles has developed an API for Zora Score that allows decentralized crypto lending platforms to not require collateral due to their algorithmic scoring. This was the first in cryptocurrency projects and protocols. The Zoracles product team will implement the Zora Score in an NFT marketplace to serve as a data point for buyer and seller reputation. Hacks are common in DeFi, and this metric protects market participants from transacting with people with a bad DeFi reputation or in connection with banned wallets. Zora Score was very different from the typical scoring system of a rating agency. Consumers have the opportunity to enhance their traditional creditworthiness with complementary products and services from companies like Credit Karma and credit partners like banks.

The project is armed with $8 million in funding from the ConsenSys alums at DARMA Capital, Aligned Capital and Delta Fund.  Layer 2 networks that run on top of Ethereum make payments faster and cheaper but are nowhere near a level where traditional financial institutions can use them, according to Nahmii CEO Jacobo Toll-Messia.  ‚ÄúYou need a product that is institution-ready, and that means not only TPS [transactions per second], but also instant finality, no latency, predictable fees,‚Äù said Toll-Messia in an interview.

42376126,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwEd4z,1632834000,Solana-Based Prediction Market Uses DeFi Yields to Finance ‚ÄòNo Loss‚Äô Betting,"Hedgehog Markets, a fledgling blockchain-based prediction market platform, is testing a novel type of wager where bettors have nothing to lose, at least in theory.  Known as ‚Äúno-loss markets,‚Äù these bets combine prediction markets with several big cryptocurrency trends: decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins and ‚Äúplay-to-earn‚Äù gaming.  To participate, bettors must put up either $100 or $1,000 worth of USDC, a stablecoin designed to hold its value against the U.S. dollar. In return, bettors receive game tokens, which they can wager in a no-loss market.  Gibraltar-based Hedgehog invests the staked USDC with Port Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol, where the stablecoins earn interest, like a crypto version of a savings account or certificate of deposit (CD). (Hedgehog and Port both run on the Solana blockchain.)  As in normal prediction markets, participants bet on the outcomes of real-world events, in this case soccer and American football games or cryptocurrency price movements. But whereas in the regular markets those who bet wrong lose money, in the no-loss variant losing bettors recover as much USDC as they put in, when the principal on the DeFi deposit is repaid.  Those who bet correctly, meanwhile, win additional game tokens and are ranked by their return on investment (ROI). The yield earned in the DeFi pool will be paid out as prize money split among those who finish at the top of the competition‚Äôs ‚ÄúROI leaderboard.‚Äù Hedgehog is dangling $5,000 to be divided up among the top bettors at the $100 level and $30,000 for distribution to the champions of the $1,000 tier.  Making it ‚Äòfun‚Äô  Hedgehog‚Äôs gamified approach follows the success of Axie Infinity, a game running on the Ethereum blockchain that amassed nearly half a million daily active users in its first year.  Gamification ‚Äúattracts a larger audience than just large-scale traders,‚Äù Hedgehog founder George Yu, a former Google software engineer, told CoinDesk. One thing Hedgehog considered was ‚Äúhow do you make it fun for people who aren‚Äôt necessarily degens‚Äù ‚Äì DeFi slang for high rollers.  If the yield from the DeFi pools falls short of the prize amounts, Hedgehog will make up the difference, said Ariana Fariab, who handles growth for Hedgehog. ‚ÄúIf the yield ends up being more, [then that‚Äôs] great, the prize pools will be larger ‚Äì all yield goes back to users in the form of prize pools.‚Äù  To be clear: The principal protection on bettors‚Äô deposits will rely on the security of the smart contracts, or the software running on the blockchain.  ‚ÄúDepending on the bug or exploit, it is possible for a nefarious actor to take some or all of the funds stored in Hedgehog‚Äôs smart contracts,‚Äù notes a disclaimer on Hedgehog‚Äôs website.  To mitigate this risk, Hedgehog has hired auditing firm Quantstamp to review the code. However, unlike a traditional bank account, the staked USDC will have nothing like FDIC insurance backing it.  ‚ÄúWe are not liable for any theft or loss of your cryptographic tokens or property resulting from your use of the services or participation in any markets,‚Äù warns Hedgehog‚Äôs terms of service.  Betting on beliefs  Prediction markets are designed to incentivize people with expertise on a topic to tell the world what they really think is going to happen by betting on consequential things like elections or tropical storms or COVID-19 case counts.  Since bettors have money on the line, they will bet on what they truly believe, and if there is money to be made, bona fide experts will have a strong motivation to participate, the thinking goes.  So far, however, this has remained a niche market, due partly to regulatory constraints.  PredictIt, probably the most popular prediction market, is allowed to operate by a no-action letter from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on the rationale that it is run for academic research purposes, and it lets traders bet up to only $850 on any one market. Kalshi, another centralized prediction market, has a full-fledged CFTC license and must notify the agency any time it creates a new market.  Hedgehog, whose official legal name is Futarchy Research Limited, raised $3.5 million in July from investors, including the Solana Foundation and crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs Alameda Research.  It is one of several crypto-based prediction markets that have sprouted up with the goal of replacing centralized intermediaries with smart contracts. Others include Polymarket, Augur and Gnosis.  Hedgehog Markets is not to be confused with Hedgehog Technologies, a startup that lets traders sync various crypto wallets and exchange accounts to get a bird‚Äôs-eye view of their portfolios, and recently raised its own seed round.",POSITIVE,USDC,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | USDC,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/28/solana-based-prediction-market-uses-defi-yields-to-finance-no-loss-betting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c10b911c35d50b825e7565268c91a9ff0ce35f99-1440x1029.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376142,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwEdRd,1632822969,"Bitcoin, Gold Under Pressure as Dollar Tracks US Treasury Yields Higher","Bitcoin is reversing the weekend‚Äôs price bounce alongside weakness in gold as the prospects of a tighter monetary policy in the U.S. push Treasury yields and the dollar higher.  The crypto market leader is trading near $41,800 at press time, down 2% for the week, after it bounced from $41,000 to $44,000 over the weekend. Gold is nursing a 0.5% loss at $1,740 per ounce, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback‚Äôs value against other major fiat currencies, has jumped to a month-and-a-half highs above 93.00. The 10-year Treasury yield is at three-month highs near 1.5%, and the two-year yield is hovering at an 18-month high of 0.28%, according to data provided by TradingView.  European bond yields are also increasing, with the oil rally bolstering expectations for a faster scaling back of stimulus by central banks.  An increase in yields is said to dilute the appeal of perceived safe-haven assets or inflation hedges like gold and bitcoin. Bitcoin, however, may remain relatively resilient, according to analysts.  ‚ÄúWhat matters for gold is real (inflation-adjusted) yields, not nominal. And, yes, real yields are rising, so I would imagine that gold will remain on the back foot,‚Äù Ilan Solot, global market strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúThis could have some marginal impact on BTC as well, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a major driver.‚Äù  Treasury data shows that the U.S. 10-year real yield has risen by 20 basis points this month but remains deep in negative territory at -0.87%. A continued ascent in real yields may hurt gold and bring moderate selling pressure for bitcoin from those who have adopted the cryptocurrency as an inflation hedge.  Institutional participation in bitcoin has increased since the March 2020 crash, making it sensitive to traditional markets. Correlations, however, are very tenuous in the crypto market, and the likes of software company MicroStrategy have added bitcoin to their balance sheet for the long haul. These big players may not sell in response to gyrations in bond yields.  Moreover, real yields are likely to stay low as the rally could bring more inflation and boost demand for inflation hedges.  ‚ÄúIf investors are looking at crypto, they‚Äôre on the hunt for the deepest yield ‚Äì yield that they struggle to get more and more from traditional markets. That coupled with the poor macro backdrop and continued soaring inflation means that crypto yield is really only just getting started,‚Äù said Ben Sebley, chief growth officer at BCB Group, a business-to-business provider of banking rails to crypto companies. ‚ÄúOnce TradFi (traditional finance) overcomes all the initial barriers to entry, I think this will be the thing that takes the [crypto] industry to the next level of global adoption.‚Äù  Past data shows bitcoin thrives in an environment of rising nominal yields.  ‚ÄúAbout 87% of bitcoin‚Äôs performance was delivered while the U.S. 10-year bond yield has been rising,‚Äù ByteTree Chief Investment Officer Charlie Morris noted in a blog post.  Lastly, according to Brown Brothers Harriman‚Äôs Solot, the connection between monetary policy and gold and bitcoin becomes more pronounced during periods of extremes, which doesn‚Äôt appear to be the case right now.  ‚ÄúThe reason the yield curve is steepening [10-year yield rising faster than the two-year yield] is in part because of earlier expectations for tapering (less QE buying bonds). It‚Äôs also, to some extent higher inflation (energy shortage, bottlenecks, microchip shortage, right labor market, etc.),‚Äù Solot told CoinDesk, referring to quantitative easing, a central bank‚Äôs stimulus program.  ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not the type of hyper-inflation tail risk some argued could happen when the Fed and U.S. government started super stimulating the economy in the early stages of the pandemic. These are supply-side inflation problems,‚Äù Solot added.  That said, bitcoin may take a hit if rising yields or China property market turmoil weighs over the global equity markets. The futures tied to the S&P 500 are trading 0.35% lower on the day. The cryptocurrency fell sharply last week along with stocks as fears about Chinese property developer Evergrande Group gripped markets. ‚ÄúAlmost every bitcoin correction in 2021 has correlated with an S&P 500 correction of -2% or more,‚Äù Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, tweeted.

About $100 billion was liquidated amid the red market. The drop in crypto assets came after the recent sell-offs in global stock markets. Fears for a new wave of Covid cases and a grim economic outlook prompted investors to stay away from risk assets. We are no doubt at a crossroads now - bitcoin is ready to make a break or head all the way down to $24k. But despite the fear, hodlers hold strong, as they always do in times of volatility and bear markets. In a poll conducted by Gabor Gurbacs, VanEck&apos;s Director of Digital Assets Strategy, more than 65% of survey participants said they would still hold bitcoin if a new price crash comes. Besides simply holding bitcoin, many investors use bitcoin to grow their wealth by staking or depositing cryptos in interest wallets. &apos;We understand that investing in Bitcoin could be risky and lately many people start to lose confidence with bitcoin continuing to drop.

42376131,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwEdF3,1632790800,Clearpool Raises $3M to Build Decentralized Capital Markets on Ethereum,"Clearpool, a decentralized capital markets ecosystem, has received $3 million in funding from a number of prominent crypto investors to further its decentralized finance (DeFi) ambitions of enabling institutions to borrow uncollateralized assets.  The project is being incubated by digital asset custodian Hex Trust, which will provide custody and compliance services such as know-your-customer (KYC) checks and transaction monitoring of Clearpool‚Äôs borrowers, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk on Tuesday.  The fresh injection of capital will go toward furthering the project‚Äôs protocol while launching additional features such as decentralized credit derivatives.  Funding has come via major players Arrington Capital, GBV Capital, HashKey Capital, Hex Trust, Sequoia Capital India, Sino Global Capital and Wintermute. Ascendex, BCW Group, FBG Capital, Folkvang, Huobi Ventures and Kenetic Capital also participated.  Clearpool allows institutions to borrow uncollateralized assets, while the lenders receive rewards and various risk management solutions.  Unlike traditional finance, DeFi lenders lack access to credit scores and risk profiles. Clearpool aims to enable lenders with the ability to better determine borrowers‚Äô creditworthiness by providing access to key information via a real-time credit scoring mechanism, according to the release.  ‚ÄúClearpool introduces several new concepts to DeFi, including single borrower liquidity pools and a system of tokenized credit,‚Äù said Clearpool CEO Robert Alcorn, adding:  ‚ÄúThese new concepts allow institutional borrowers to access uncollateralized liquidity directly from the DeFi ecosystem and provide lenders with sophisticated risk management and hedging solutions.‚Äù",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SPONSORED,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/28/clearpool-raises-3m-to-build-decentralized-capital-markets-ecosystem-on-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c6e6da28938c561e9ae87723547134a82e218afe-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376145,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwEdSt,1632787564,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Traders Cautious After China Crypto Ban, DeFi Outperforms","Bitcoin was slightly lower on Monday as traders remained cautious about regulatory crackdowns from China and elsewhere.  The cryptocurrency was trading at about $43,000 at press time and is roughly flat over the past 24 hours. Analysts are monitoring blockchain data for signs of buyer accumulation, although it may be too early to tell if sellers have fully capitulated.  For now, it appears that some buyers have shifted their focus away from bitcoin and moved into decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens in the wake of China‚Äôs crackdown on cryptocurrency activities. For example, Messari data shows the PERP token initially spiked about 55% toward $17 on Monday, although the price settled at about $15 at press time. PERP is the utility token facilitating and incentivizing the decentralized governance of the Perpetual Protocol.  Analysts expect China‚Äôs crypto industry to phase out given the recent ban.  ‚ÄúI think OTC platforms that are operated from the big exchanges will close down,‚Äù said Bobby Lee, founder and CEO of the Ballet wallet service and former head of BTCC, once one of the biggest bitcoin exchanges in China in an interview with CoinDesk. ‚ÄúOTC‚Äù refers to over-the-counter trading, or off-exchange.  And on Monday, Ethereum mining pool SparkPool said it plans to suspend services for all its users by Sept. 30.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC), $43,075, -0.4%  Ether (ETH), $2,999, -1.8%  S&P 500: -0.3%  Gold: $1,751, +0.0%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.487%  Bitcoin fund inflows  Investors pumped $95 million into digital asset products last week, more than double the prior week‚Äôs pace, according to a CoinShares weekly report.  With the headwinds that digital assets have faced recently, such as China‚Äôs ban, the inflows suggest that price declines may have been seen as buying opportunities, CoinDesk‚Äôs Lyllah Ledesma reported.  Flows into all crypto funds during the week ended Sept. 24 were the most since the $98 million in the week through Sept. 3, and brought total inflows over the last six weeks to $320 million.  Bitcoin saw the largest inflows of any crypto investment product with a total of $50 million, also the most in three weeks.  Test of buyer conviction  Analysts are questioning whether bitcoin holders can sustain enough buying power to support further price increases into the fourth quarter. Prices are now back near the cost basis for most short-term holders, similar to September 2020, which preceded a price rally.  This time, however, ‚Äúthe 50%+ correction in May resulted in a flushing out of many retail traders and investors, and thus interest in the [Bitcoin] protocol has waned since early 2021,‚Äù Glassnode wrote in a blog post.  About 58% of short-term holders are already experiencing losses (current BTC price below the acquired price), according to Glassnode data. The holders who entered over the past two months could decide to sell their BTC at a loss, which could drive prices lower, or accumulate more BTC in hopes of turning a profit.  The chart below shows the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio, which measures BTC‚Äôs market capitalization relative to its realized market value. The current MVRV suggests that BTC is trading at roughly its fair value after the May sell-off.  Altcoin roundup  DeFi tokens PERP, DYDX lead crypto market higher: Native tokens of decentralized trading platforms such as Perpetual Protocol and dYdx are surging as China‚Äôs crypto crackdown saw centralized exchanges scramble to comply with new regulations. Perpetual Protocol‚Äôs PERP token surged 55% in the past 24 hours, reaching $17 a token, CoinDesk‚Äôs Omar Godble reported. Derivatives DEX dYdx registered a trading volume of more than $4.3 billion in the past 24 hours, surpassing the Nasdaq-listed centralized crypto exchange Coinbase‚Äôs $3.7 billion.  Immutable X token sales raise over $12.5 million in under an hour: Ethereum scaling product Immutable X‚Äôs token sale on CoinList sold out in less than one hour and raised $12.5 million for the project, CoinDesk‚Äôs Jamie Crawley reported. Of the 720,000 accounts that registered to participate in the sale, only about 25,000 (3.6%) were able to make purchases due to the high demand, Immutable announced Monday. The company said it is aiming for the IMX token to be Ethereum‚Äôs ‚ÄúStripe for NFTs,‚Äù offering gas-free non-fungible token minting and trading, referring to payments company Stripe.  Cardano‚Äôs commercial arm to invest $100 million in DeFi, NFTs and blockchain education: Emurgo, the commercial and venture arm of Cardano, is investing $100 million to ‚Äúaccelerate the development of the Cardano ecosystem,‚Äù Emurgo CEO Ken Kodama announced at the Cardano Summit 2021 on Sunday. Emurgo also said it would be pouring additional funding into African artificial intelligence, blockchain and smart technologies firm Adanian Labs.
