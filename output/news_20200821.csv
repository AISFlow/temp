Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,674 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 1.4% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,605-$11,892.  BTC below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Read More: Bitcoin Options Open Interest Nears All Time High      After holding around $11,800 Thursday into Friday, bitcoin started to slide downward around 08:00 UTC (4 a.m. ET), dropping to a 24-hour low of $11,605. Spot volumes were lower to cap off the workweek. It was $138 million on major spot USD/BTC exchange Coinbase, lower than its $179 million average over the past month.      Over-the-counter crypto trader Henrik Kugelberg expects a bullish, if not record, fourth quarter ahead for bitcoin, even if the number of sluggish market days pile up. “I expect a slower curve but would not be surprised if we reach a $15,000 BTC in October and somewhere around $18,000-$20,000 at year end.”      Kugelberg points to the uncertain economy as giving people reason to swap fiat for crypto investments. “There’s the falling value of the dollar to be priced in; we have not seen the end of the dollar’s fall that is for sure,” he added. Indeed, while the U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the greenback’s strength versus a basket of other fiat currencies, is up 0.52% Friday, it’s still at lows not seen since June 2018.      In the bitcoin options market, Neil Van Huis, director of sales and institutional trading at liquidity provider Blockfills, noted volatility decreased this week. Bitcoin’s at-the-money implied volatility, which is a metric to forecast movement in prices, has dropped from 71% Monday to 59% Friday. “Looks like some normalization of volatile trading as of late,” Van Huis said.      Opportunities in Ethereum-powered DeFi are taking some traders’ focus away from the bitcoin market, Kugelbrg told CoinDesk. “The crypto community is in a total FOMO to DeFi-related altcoins,” said Kugelberg. “I believe the run-up for bitcoin may be slower than expected and fueled by retail sales to newcomers wanting a somewhat steadier haven.”      Read More: Barstool’s Dave Portnoy Is Bad at Trading Cryptocurrency    Ether options market bearish    Ether (ETH) was down Friday, trading around $399 and slipping 3.8% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Despite the probabilities, Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner for Tellurian Capital, which has been investing in crypto projects since 2014, is still bullish on ether. He doesn’t see Ethereum’s fundamental issues, such as fees constraining the network, as anything but a speed bump on the fast-moving DeFi highway. “Structurally, no,” said Bonnefous. “But short term, ether needs a new trigger to go higher.”      Read More: INX Crypto Exchange to Launch $117M IPO Next Week    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Friday.

Besides leading to a sizable bitcoin purchase, Portnoy’s meeting with the Winklevoss brothers also resulted in a $50,000 purchase of chainlink (LINK).  As of Friday, and after losing $25,000, however, Portnoy told his Twitter followers, “I currently own zero bitcoins.”  The bellwether cryptocurrency actually gained more than 7% in the days following Portnoy’s broadcasted purchase. At last check, BTC is still up 1% from the daily open on the day of Portnoy’s meeting.  LINK, however, dumped 30% since Portnoy signaled his bullishness for the coin, tweeting, “LINK to the moon.”  Another alternative cryptocurrency, orchid (OXT), also dropped 28% since Portnoy tweeted about his position.  Trading cryptocurrency just isn’t easy, explained Anil Lulla, former analyst at Bloomberg and co-founder of cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital. “The market is a bit more sophisticated than it was in 2017. You've seen a shift where capital has been flowing to projects with some fundamentals instead of just good marketing and buzzwords.”  Dismissing his losses, Portnoy responded to a fake Tyler Winklevoss account that expressed disappointment in the celebrity trader’s decision to sell LINK by saying, “I make six figures a day like clockwork in the real stock market. No need to sit around losing money waiting for Elon [Musk] to mine gold from outer space.”  The possibility of mining gold on asteroids was a value proposition for investing in BTC pitched to Portnoy by the Winklevoss twins.  ""Having a long-term fundamental view helps deal with the short-term volatility,"" said Ryan Watkins, bitcoin analyst at Messari and former investment banking analyst at Moelis & Co., referring to trading cryptocurrencies in a private message with CoinDesk.  Because everyone looks like a genius in a bull market, though, Lulla said he wouldn’t be surprised to see Portnoy eventually “have some fun and post some headline-grabbing gains.”",NEGATIVE,BTC | LINK,BTC | FIAT | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/21/barstools-dave-portnoy-is-bad-at-trading-cryptocurrency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c730cfd947fe9e32b57f2c3ea10ddccda92ba9b8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384489,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXcgv,1598027074,"Bitcoin Mining Facility With Room for 50,000 Rigs Set to Launch in Kazakhstan","One of the largest mining facilities in the world – with output to rival a small power station – is set to open for business in the mining-friendly country of Kazakhstan in September.    Mining facility operator Enegix told CoinDesk Friday it will be ready to open its 180 megawatt (MW) data center to mining pools at the start of September.  Based in Ekibastuz, near the Russian border, the facility can host up to 50,000 mining rigs, according to sales director Dmitriy Ivanov.  Assuming full capacity with Bitmain's AntMiner S19 series or MicroBT’s WhatsMiner M30, that would represent mining power of about 5-6 EH/s – approximately 4% of bitcoin's current hashrate.  Enegix already operates two mining facilities but the Ekibastuz site is its largest – it will employ upwards of 160 people, including engineers, electricians and security personnel.  The facility would handle as much electricity as needed to power 180,000 U.S. homes.  Construction on the facility began in August 2019 and has reportedly cost $23 million, according to a series of slides shared with CoinDesk.  The center will get its electricity straight from the Kazakhstani grid, which itself will source the power from a local coal-fired station. Ivanov said it was the cheapest source of power available.  Electricity in Kazakstan is cheap and plentiful, with much of the country's surplus currently exported to neighboring countries.  This makes the country well-placed to become a global center for mining facilities, said Ivanov. National power stations rarely operate at full capacity so there's room for facilities to expand, and more to come online to use the power.  Unlike China, where electricity prices change depending on the season, costs at the Ekibastuz facility will stay much the same year-round.  Keen to attract business and foreign investment, the government has created a taxation framework to help further legitimize cryptocurrency mining in the country.  Indeed, Cambridge University's Bitcoin Mining Map shows Kazakhstan now ranks fourth in the world for hashrate distribution – up from sixth in Q3 2019.  Although clients will be free to mine any cryptocurrencies they wish, Enegix anticipates – as with their existing data centers – that most will mine bitcoin.  Representatives from mining companies ViaBTC, BTC.com, Canaan, and Innosilicon have already visited the site, Ivanov said.    See also: Top Bitcoin Mining Pools See 15% Hashrate Drop Amid Continuous Rainstorms in China      UPDATE (Aug.22, 10:35 UTC): A previous version of this article stated that the power came from Russia, that Dmitriy Ivanov was a director and that F2Pool had visited the site.

In light of the vulnerability, Ethereum Classic Labs, self-described as “stewards” of the blockchain, detailed a plan to protect and revitalize the fledgling network in a blog post published Wednesday.    Ethereum Classic’s current hashrate of roughly 3.2 terahash per second is down 74% from Jan. 1 and down 84% from its all-time high of 20.4 terahash per second set in late January, according to Coin Metrics. The downward trend continued after back-to-back 51% attacks during the first week in August.  The first attack occurring on Aug. 1 was mistakenly dismissed as a miner software malfunction. Five days later, another 51% attack was launched. Both attacks reorganized more than 3,000 blocks on the Ethereum Classic chain.  As part of its “immediate attack prevention” measures, ETC Labs plans to implement a “defensive mining” strategy “through cooperation with miners and mining pools,” according to the post, with one of the stated goals being to “maintain a more consistent hash rate.”  “We are determined to protect the integrity of the ecosystem,” the post read.  CoinDesk was unable to learn details about the so-called defensive mining. “The details about the defensive mining strategy are confidential for now,” said Terry Culver, CEO of Ethereum Classic Labs, in an email correspondence.  Regardless of how the defensive mining is implemented, however, protecting the Ethereum Classic ecosystem appears to be an uphill battle after the Coinbase exchange extended ethereum classic (ETC) confirmation times to roughly two weeks after the attacks and OKEx publicly said it will consider delisting the cryptocurrency.  In addition, the defensive mining strategy will almost certainly be forced to compete against ether (ETH) mining profitability, said Thomas Heller, previously director at leading cryptocurrency mining company F2Pool.  “Profitability is the only angle miners care about,” he added, noting that whether Ethereum Classic Labs has the funds to sustain the profitability of defensive mining is an important question. Miners would simply choose to mine ether if it’s more profitable than defensive mining for ethereum classic, Heller said.  Since the attacks, the price of ethereum classic has barely moved, trading at $6.83 at last check, little more than 3% below its price on the day of the second attack.",NEGATIVE,ETC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/21/ethereum-classic-labs-plans-defensive-mining-strategy-as-hashrate-plummets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01932f717887d30d2b1f56099e676e9b2e1180c7-1097x725.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency and security token exchange signaled plans to go public in January 2018, aiming to become the first Securities and Exchange Commission-compliant security token offering, open to mom-and-pop investors. INX will price 130 million tokens at $0.90 each, totaling $117 million in gross proceeds. These tokens will have utility on the company’s exchange and entitle investors to a share in profits.      Auto complete? Three Swiss crypto companies have completed the first automated bitcoin transaction that meets anti-money laundering (AML) standards. Zug-based Crypto Finance AG and 21 Analytics, and Geneva's Mt Pelerin announced Friday 21 CHF worth of bitcoin (~$23) had been sent in a live demonstration of a new transaction using the Travel Rule Protocol, an automated way to comply with standards set by the Financial Action Task Force’s “Travel Rule.” Since being adopted, intermediaries have had to do Travel Rule compliance manually.

In the short term, ETC Labs will attempt to stabilize the chain’s plummeting hashrate, increase network monitoring, coordinate closely with exchanges and deploy a finality arbitration system. Longer term could see a change in ETC’s proof-of-work mining algorithm, the introduction of a treasury system and adding 51% attack-resistant features.

It also pumps up Ethereum's reserves, where well over half of the nearly $13 billion circulating USDT already reside. Ethereum is a hotbed for decentralized finance projects and as such a popular spot for USDT.

Excerpted below, you can read the full story here.      Bitcoin has lost its way Like the ancient Irish poets, the filí, programmers have the ability to alter reality with an utterance. Code is an incantation, an act of summoning ideas and inclinations into material reality. It is a conduit between the sphere of ideation and that of politics and sociality.      But technology isn’t merely the product of ideas – it actively shapes belief systems, reconfiguring the world in which it is applied.      Programmers know this: When a user’s behavior is influenced by code, it’s called opinionated software. When a user is manipulated for corporate interests, it is known as a dark pattern.      Software also has unintended consequences. Released into the wild, code propagates ideology in unpredictable and chaotic ways. Inevitably, it backfires, and innovation flows through human society, irrespective of, and indifferent to, political difference.      To what extent technology is informed by and produces belief systems has haunted me throughout my adult life.      It has caused me nightmares: dark conclusions on the nature of technology, prophecies of machine takeover and terrifying visions of the future of war.      It has also given me dreams. I believe it is within humanity’s power to reshape the narrative by which technology is formed. In doing so, it becomes possible to take back the reins of runaway technological innovation and re-orientate human destiny.      Crypto is at the front line of this struggle.    Market intel    Open and shut? Open positions in bitcoin (BTC) options are at near-record levels, increasing to $2.1 billion Thursday. The number of bearish puts relative to bullish calls has recovered from -10.3% to -3% in the past four days, indicating traders are offloading much of their call options onto the market. This suggests bullish speculation is beginning to ease – a sign of investors anticipating consolidation or price drop, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole said.    Tech pod    Going wumbo LND, a Lightning Network implementation from startup Lightning Labs, has adopted support for wumbo channels. This SpongeBob Squarepants-themed standard removes a limit to the amount of bitcoin that can be held in a Lightning channel (currently 0.16777215 BTC) as well as limits on how large an individual payment (previously 0.04294967 BTC) can be, CoinDesk contributor Alyssa Hertig reports. Caps were placed to prevent catastrophic losses on this experimental protocol. ACINQ’s eclair and Blockstream’s c-lightning both adopted a form of wumbo earlier this year.      Not a spoof A little-discussed type of SIM card is causing havoc for unsuspecting victims. “White SIMs make it extremely easy to conduct outgoing spoofed calls,” said Hartej Sawhney, Principal at cybersecurity agency Zokyo. “They are illegal basically everywhere.” These cards offer the ability to spoof any number, can be encrypted and in some cases allows the user’s voice to be altered and cloaked. Such SIM cards are favored by criminals, and they can make social engineering attacks like those that struck Twitter last month easier to execute, CoinDesk privacy reporter Ben Powers said.

42384497,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXcnD,1598025646,Money Reimagined: DeFi-ing History,"To foretell the future of decentralized finance (DeFi), the exploding new field in which decentralized governance protocols set and execute the terms for lending, borrowing and stablecoin issuance, one should look to the past.      Specifically, look to Wall Street’s past.      By some measures, DeFi is nothing new. It extends a four-decade cycle of ever-more sophisticated financial engineering – from junk bond financing to collateralized debt obligations to algorithmic trading. These waves of technological evolution have delivered spectacular profits to some, giant losses to others and lasting change to Wall Street, albeit while strengthening its large financial institutions’ dominance of our economy.      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      DeFi will face the same pattern: engineering, hype, speculation, bust and consolidation. (Yes, folks, the boom in “yield farming” and in the tokens loved by “degens” will end in tears.) Yet, it, too, will have a lasting impact, in ways we don’t know at present.      In eschewing the need for intermediation, the DeFi innovation wave lies, for now, outside of the traditional banking system. It’s a separation that should allow DeFi pioneers to experiment without grave risk to the wider population, enabling rich, real-world learning. Regardless of how much money investors win or lose, this iterative process will, hopefully, deliver more structural change than the financial engineering that’s come before.      DeFi definitely won’t free us of volatility. But it could free us from Wall Street’s version of volatility, in which powerful banking intermediaries, backed by regulatory privilege, perpetually co-opt technologies to cement their stranglehold over our economy.    Four decades, four innovation bubbles    Looking at four past financial engineering waves in traditional markets, it’s worth noting they did not necessarily involve digital technology. Periods of change are as much about new ideas in legal structures and risk management as they are about the software that often enables them.      That history also shows how enthusiasm over innovation often feeds a fatal flaw in investors’ mindsets: the idea the new system has removed or significantly reduced risk, the ultimate moderator of market excess. That mistaken belief fuels bubbles, whose effect is often felt in unexpected segments of the market.      Yet, despite that failure, the innovation often still delivers lasting value beyond the bubble.      Let’s look at four past such moments:      The 1980s: Junk bonds and leveraged buyouts      In the eighties, corporate managers and private equity firms conspired to make quick profits with LBOs. These takeovers were funded by the novel strategy of issuing high-yield (junk) bonds that were backed by the assets of the target companies – before those assets were acquired.      A self-reinforcing cycle of high-yielding bond returns, rising stock prices and corporate raider opportunism meant the junk bond market swelled by 20 times over the decade. Then, in 1989, the party stopped as savings and loan institutions that had invested in junk bonds went belly up. “Junk bond king” Michael Milken went to jail for securities fraud, his firm Drexel Burnham Lambert collapsed and the savings and loan (S&L) crisis helped push the U.S. into recession two years later.      Both junk bonds and LBOs remain fixtures of American capitalism.      The 1990s: Long-Term Capital Management      The Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund grew exponentially in the mid-nineties, fueled by an innovative convergence and arbitrage strategy. With a system informed by the Black-Scholes options pricing model – two of that model’s three Nobel Prize-winning creators were LTCM founders – the fund analyzed masses of past and present data to determine when prices of securities representing the same underlying legal risk diverged from their historical mean. Buying one and short-selling the other would, in theory, deliver a convergence gain once markets reverted to the mean.      This worked very well for a time as LTCM put on similar bets across the entire market with numerous counterparties. But when the 1998 Russian debt crisis sparked a global panic and investors dumped all but the world’s most liquid assets, rather than converge LTCM’s bets diverged – and in unison. The aggregate loss was so big and their counterparty obligations so wide that the Federal Reserve engineered a bailout to prevent markets from seizing up.      The fund’s new owners wound it down. But LTCM-like analytics and arbitrage strategies are arguably even more widespread now in the age of algorithmic trading (see below).    The 2000s: CDOs, CDS and the housing bubble    The mother of all financial crises is often blamed on homebuyers borrowing beyond their means. But that was just the front-office element of a back-office machine that drove banks’ hunger for mortgage loans they’d bundle into complex new debt instruments known as collateralized debt obligations (CDO).      Along with credit default swaps – a legal innovation allowing bondholders to buy a promise from a third-party to pay them if a lender defaults on their bonds – CDOs fueled the misguided idea that high-risk loans could be transformed into AAA-rated debt. The myth that the risk bogey had been slain was incredibly destructive because it fueled a bubble whose bursting precipitated the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.      A decade later, CDOs are back. It’s just they’re now described as CLOs, for collateralized loan obligations, and they apply to corporate loans, not home loans. In an economy hobbled by COVID-19, they have people worried.    2010: The Flash Crash    The 2000s also saw the rise of “quants.” Armed with new low-latency, high-speed lines, these math whizzes programmed computers to move hedge funds’ money in and out of positions within milliseconds to capitalize on anomalous price discrepancies that humans eyes and hands could never keep up with. Some worried about an unfair competitive advantage, but markets generally welcomed these automated buying-and-selling machines for the liquidity they provided. They filled a gap left by Wall Street bankers, who’d become less willing to act as market-makers in the more regulated aftermath of the financial crisis.      Then, at 2:32 p.m. ET on May 6, 2010, something unprecedented happened. For no immediately apparent reason, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 9% over a 15-minute period, only to recover almost all those losses before 3:07 p.m. Five years later, charges were brought against Navinder Singh Sarao, a British financial trader accused of using spoofing algorithms to trick trading machines into executing the wild sell-off.    It will be a volatile ride, but much will be learned.    Many believe blaming a single trader was wrong and that the crash was a function of an over-dependence on automated liquidity, which worked fine when the machines were on but provoked disaster when, for whatever reason, they were turned off. New rules now try to offset flash crash risks, but there has been no stopping the quants, whose algorithms are now entrenched as the system’s market-makers.    Lessons for DeFi    The parallels with DeFi should be clear.      As with those prior periods in which innovation proved overwhelmingly alluring, developers will continue to be drawn to this booming movement of financial innovation. Just as math geniuses snubbed civil engineering jobs in the 2000s to grab seven-figure salaries at hedge funds, similar graduates at MIT, Stanford and elsewhere are drawn to the crypto space now. DeFi will accelerate that process.      Investors will continue to be drawn as well. Betting on a fast buck never feels more justified than when you believe you’re investing in a world-changing technology.      The losses will come too. But, mercifully, the impact will be limited to the still relatively small number of souls engaged in this particular form of speculation.  I appreciate the warnings of systemic risk from people like Maya Zehavi, who used DeFi’s first “flash loan” attack in February to argue the system is vulnerable to cascading losses that could be more extreme than in regulated markets. I see something that could look like the meltdown of 2008.      But if it looks like 2008, it won’t be nearly of the same magnitude. That’s because DeFi is not Wall Street.      DeFi doesn’t attract the masses, precisely because the same legal protections that regulated financial institutions are supposed to afford their investors don’t exist there. Ironically, the relatively weak regulatory framework for crypto means the harm it can do is small.      Yes, folks will get hurt, but we can take heart knowing the wider financial system will be mostly untouched.      The good news is, its relatively small size allows DeFi to continue fostering real-world experiments with minimal risk to society at large. It will be a volatile ride, but much will be learned.      Thankfully, that will keep alive the dream of a financial system that’s not controlled by powerful intermediaries.    New York: A COVID conundrum or a clue?    For all the financial charts we’ve presented in this section each week, none are as important as the chart type we present today. It’s the one that defines our time: the ubiquitous COVID-19 curve flattener chart.      These curves tell us of society’s progress, or otherwise, in managing the pandemic and therefore what kind of path to reopening we might face. By extension, they tell a tale of the Fed’s likely monetary stimulus, the market’s behavioral response to that stimulus, and the risks that it generates long-run inflation as trust in fiat money wanes. It also tells us about the potential for people to find appeal in gold or its “digital gold” competitor, bitcoin.      So, I gotta say, comparing New York’s curve to, say, California’s is striking. It’s almost baffling. By the standards of the U.S’s’s abominable overall performance, New York has looked relatively calm throughout the summer, with an infection rate that continues to hold below 1 percent of tests. Yes, the state has been generally more aggressive than others in imposing quarantine rules and adopting mask-wearing, perhaps because New York City learned harsh lessons during those dark days of death in April. But although international travel has been limited, NYC continues to be the most transient community in the country, if not the world, and it’s the most densely populated piece of land. It surprises me that the alarming surge of new cases elsewhere in the U.S. hasn’t transplanted back into my home state. Touch wood.      Here’s California’s chart:      And New York's:      These are both Democrat-led states that are supportive of the medical community’s warnings on safety precautions. Leaders in California have at times been praised for their response, while New York’s have been criticized, especially early on in the crisis. What to make of this? Why has California been dragged into the summer rebound in COVID-19 seen across many U.S. states while New York has, for all intents and purposes, flattened the curve? What can we learn from this comparison?      I’d like to think it’s because New York was aggressive about data, about both gathering information and sharing it – via, for example, Governor Andrew Cuomo’s daily press conferences. Information is the most powerful tool we have in the fight against COVID-19, which is why CoinDesk’s Benjamin Powers has written extensively about the blockchain-based projects building privacy-preserving contact tracing apps that aim to obtain medical information while protecting civil liberties.      It’s not easy to measure the causal factors here. That few lessons can be taken at this stage speaks volumes about the uncertainty associated with how this disease will impact us going forward. And that’s why there’s so much uncertainty in markets and concern over the future of the dollar.    Global town hall    SUBWAY MANAGER OF LAST RESORT. Still with New York, here’s a Not-The-Onion story for you. When New York’s Metropolitan Transport Authority needed to raise $451 million to keep the trains running on time, it didn’t go to a bank or a municipal bond investor, it issued notes to the Federal Reserve. This is all above-board. In fact, the MTA is the second municipal transit agency to use funds from the central bank, as part of a new COVID-19 stimulus response $500 billion facility that the Fed set up for towns and cities. But it highlights concerns people have about the Fed’s monetization efforts and how that might undermine its independence, if not now, then in the future.      It’s no secret the MTA is severely underfunded, and with New York City’s subway suffering enormously from the city’s pandemic shutdown, who’s to say it will be able to service its bonds in the future? What happens if it defaults? Even though the U.S. Treasury has invested $35 billion in presumably loss-absorbing equity in the Fed’s facility, it’s not clear that will be enough if the MTA or other municipal entities get into trouble. If the Fed does face losses on its notes, would it seriously take ownership and control of the subway and commuter rail assets? How would it deal with political pressure from politicians that it forgive or restructure the debt?      Central banks fought hard in the post-Bretton Woods era to maintain their independence. It was considered an important facet of their relative success at fighting inflation, at least in developed countries. There’s a real concern that these kinds of arrangements will undermine that independence. In my opinion, that’s what will put economies at risk of future inflation – not necessarily the large amounts of currency they’ve issued to satisfy crisis-era demand for money. If you’re looking for an excuse to own bitcoin as a hedge against the politicization and debasement of money, this is the kind of thing to watch.      THE ROAD TO DEFI UTOPIA, PAVED WITH SPECULATORS. And… back to DeFi. (It’s hard to avoid at the moment.) In a smart Twitter thread this week, 0x Senior Counsel Jason Somensatto waxed lyrical on the state of DeFi protocols, arguing the present moment will see winners that don’t really offer much real economic value. In other words, DeFi is, for now, purely a speculators’ playground.      But he makes a strong case for why that shouldn’t matter so long as development continues. In the early stages of trying to build out an alternative financial system that delivers widely felt economic value, how these speculators experiment with governance for decentralized communities will be important. Somensatto writes that “most of the high profile successful DeFi projects in the near future will probably not be relevant for what they create but may teach lessons for the creation of future communities on how to successfully incentivize ownership and governance over a public good.” He then focuses on a bunch of useful lessons people are learning: the advantages of a single wallet for all your financial transactions, the proper management of smart contract risk, and the radical idea that a governance token is the “antithesis” of a security. (Unlike the traditional idea of a security, where the holder is promised returns for passively investing in a project that someone else runs, Somensatto says money is made from tokens when investors proactively coordinate with other members of the token-holding community.) DeFi might be a casino right now, but as the players figure out how to play the game society benefits.      $2 TRILLION. That’s now Apple’s market valuation. The mainstream U.S. mindset would see this remarkable milestone as a reward for the ingenuity and business acumen of Steve Jobs’ company. And by extension it would see it as a measure of American capitalism’s success. But I have a contrarian view.      While Apple is clearly a master at combining technology with design to generate almost cult-like demand for its products, a number as big as that, particularly at a time of economic stress, speaks more loudly about the failure of this particular era of capitalism than it does of its success. That kind of crazy money is only possible in this digital age if your business model is built upon a centralized, monopolistic position that serves your interests but not those of the market.      Apple is primarily a device maker, but much like Google, Facebook, Amazon and other centralized Internet behemoths it builds value by acting as a gatekeeping platform. Whether by constantly changing the connection standards for its devices to prevent people from shifting to third-party alternatives, or by setting the rules by which products get App Store approval (see Epic Games v Apple), Apple’s dominance exploits a kind of God-like position that lets it, essentially, print money.      Note: This is not a socialist argument. Innovators should be encouraged to try to make as much money as they can. But as a society we need to be asking tough questions about whether centralized rule-setters, be they governments or corporate platforms, hinder newcomers from taking their own shot at the top.    Relevant reads    Bitcoin DeFi May Be Unstoppable, What Does It Look Like?Given that Bitcoin was the inspiration for Ethereum, it was interesting to learn from CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen of frenetic efforts to apply concepts developed in the Ethereum ecosystem to those of Bitcoin. If it works, if developers can, for example, use the Lightning Network to execute off-chain smart contracts in a truly decentralized fashion, they may turn Bitcoin into a more efficient platform for financial experimentation than Ethereum, whose DeFi-driven congestion is now suffering from sky-high transaction costs.      The OCC’s Crypto Custody Letter Was Years in the Making. When the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency made the groundbreaking announcement that it would allow federally chartered banks to provide custody services for cryptocurrencies, it was assumed by many that this big move was the mastermind of the OCC’s new acting chief, Brian Brooks. After all, Brooks’ previous job was as chief legal officer for cryptocurrency exchange and wallet Coinbase. But in a report based on a detailed interview with Jonathan Gould, the senior deputy comptroller and chief counsel, Nikhilesh De explains the announcement was actually years in the making.      The Bitcoiners Who Live 'Permanently Not There'. It’s not unusual for people of wealth to seek out domiciles where the tax burden isn’t so heavy.

42384469,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXZ4z,1598017515,0x Price Hits Two-Year High on Hopes Falling Ethereum Fees Will Spur DEX Trading,"Hopes the bottleneck on the Ethereum blockchain might now ease have sent tokens associated with decentralized exchanges – known as DEX tokens – soaring, with the token of the 0x exchange (ZRX) rallying to a two-year high on Friday.    CoinDesk data shows ZRX surged 40% from $0.61 to $0.97 – the highest level since October 2018 – in early morning trading.  The rise comes just days after stablecoin provider Tether made plans to launch its USDT token on layer-2 scaling solution OMG Network and take some of the load off Ethereum.  As most decentralized exchanges run on Ethereum, this is good news for the exchanges and their tokens.  For example, analysts hope Tether's move will bring down average transaction fees, which recently reached a record high of $6 last week.  Ethereum-based DEXs like 0x and also Kyber Network (KNC) are vulnerable to network congestion on Ethereum as high fees reduce trading activity.  “Any reduction in ETH transaction costs due to tether’s migration on the OMG network is a huge win for DEX trading,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research for crypto prime broker Bequant, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  While KNC is only up by 3% it has also surged 900% year to date. Other prominent DEX coins such as Aave's LEND have gained 3,000%, while ZRX has increased by 300% YTD.  ZRX may, therefore, be catching up with its peers as it still has plenty of ground to cover, Vinokourov said.  Glassnode data shows that as of Thursday, the mean fee per Ethereum transaction was $3.17 – significantly higher than the $0.55 seen in July.    See also: DEX Aggregator 1inch Raises $2.8M From Binance Labs, Galaxy Digital and More    It remains to be seen whether Ethereum fees will fall back to July levels – this uncertainty may help explain why the ZRX price has pulled back to $0.75 just as CoinDesk was going to press.

42384471,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXZ8l,1598014958,First Mover: Wacky Bitcoin-to-DeFi Crypto Markets Might Be New Home of Capitalism,"Price Point    Bitcoin was slightly lower early Friday, leaving the cryptocurrency on track for its first weekly price decline since mid-July.      The largest cryptocurrency broke above $12,000 earlier in the week and failed to hold the gains, though John Willock, CEO of crypto asset manager Tritum, told CoinDesk Thursday that “maybe we’ve got $13,500 in the next phase up in the coming days.”      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      European stocks were up and the euro was down early Friday as investors continued to bet on technology shares and a vaccine breakthrough while shrugging off fresh signs that the economic recovery is faltering. The dollar was headed for its first weekly gain since mid-June.      ""It does almost seem as if the entire crypto market is taking its cues from the U.S. dollar,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, told subscribers in an email.    Market moves    Even after growing 100-fold in the past five years, the entirety of the cryptocurrency asset class, which has a total market valuation of $372 billion, is just fraction of the $35 trillion U.S. stock market.      What's surprising is that still-fledgling digital-asset markets might be more rational and functional these days than Wall Street: The various ups and downs of token prices are sending out bona fide market signals that point to projects and opportunities where capital is warranted, and investors are responding.      Mainstream investment analysts and Wall Street Journal columnists now assert matter-of-factly that the stock market is merely propped up by this year's $3 trillion of money-printing by the Federal Reserve.      Sure, bitcoin has benefited from the perception that the largest cryptocurrency might benefit from inflation, since many investors see it as a hedge against currency debasement, similar to gold.      Far more fascinating are the capital flows into the semi-autonomous lending and trading systems being built atop the Ethereum and other blockchains under the rubric of ""decentralized finance,"" or DeFi.    A real market?    Soaring token prices for projects like Aave, Chainlink, Compound and Curve, not to mention good-luck-explaining-this-to-your-friends outliers like Yam and Spaghetti, have indeed attracted capital, at least for stretches. According to DeFi pulse, total value socked away into the platforms has jumped 10-fold this year to $7 billion.      It might all just be speculative hype, but that might actually be preferable to global foreign exchange markets that are heavily influenced if not controlled by central bank officials.      Within the digital-asset ecosystem, investors have figured out how to quickly allocate and reallocate capital whenever new opportunities arise.      CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey reported on Thursday that juicy returns in the DeFi market are making some investors shift away, at least temporarily, from putting their money into options contracts on bitcoin.      “Every derivatives trader that was looking for incremental yield and levered returns has been besotted by the magnitude of moves in DeFi,” Viashl Shah, founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, told Cawrey. “So, naturally, cost of capital dictates at least some attention that way.”      Traders are even are putting their bitcoins into DeFi platforms to take advantage of the higher yields in the fast-growing arena.      Since the start of the year, the number of bitcoin locked in DeFi has grown 34-fold to about 49,000.      It might be a bubble, but at least it's not a game of trying to anticipate the Fed's next move. In fact there's even room for investors to take bets on which projects might become dominant players in the future, without struggling so much to understand what exactly is happening, as often seems to be the case these days in so many traditional markets.      “DeFi long term will revolutionize finance, but this short-term bubble is bound to pop eventually, in my opinion,” Michael Gord, co-founder of trading firm Global Digital Assets, told Cawrey. At that point, the locked-up bitcoins might flow back out of DeFi, and more money might flow back into bitcoin options.      Almost like a real market.    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin has pulled back more than 5% from the 13-month high above $12,400 reached on Monday.    Unless buying action comes quick, downwards momentum could push prices down to $11,000, the cryptocurrency trading firm QCP noted earlier this week.  Open interest in bitcoin options has risen back to near record high levels seen in July.  However, that is not necessarily a bullish development, as investors have recently sold call options. That is evident from the recent recovery in the one-month put-call skew from -10% to -3%.  Investors typically sell call options when they expect prices to consolidate or drop.

The Binance initiative aims to tap into this year’s booming DeFi market by offering users the ability to earn ""staking rewards,"" similar to interest on a bank deposit.

42384472,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXZ7V,1598014800,An AWS Virtual Machine Is Infected With Mining Malware. There Could Be Others,"A cybersecurity firm has unearthed a monero mining script embedded in a public instance of an Amazon Web Service (AWS) virtual machine. Now the firm is raising the question: How many other community Amazon Machine Instances (AMIs) are infected with the same malware?      Researchers at Mitiga revealed in a blog post Friday an AWS AMI for a Windows 2008 virtual server hosted by an unverified vendor is infected with a Monero mining script. The malware would have infected any device running the AMI with the purpose of using the device’s processing power to mine the privacy coin monero in the background – a malware attack that has become all too common in crypto’s digital wild west.      “Mitiga’s security research team has identified an AWS Community AMI containing malicious code running an unidentified crypto (Monero) miner. We have concerns this may be a phenomenon, rather than an isolated occurrence,” the blog post reads.    Monero meets AMI    Businesses and other entities use Amazon Web Services to spin up what are called “EC2” instances of popular programs and services. Also known as virtual machines, these EC2s are developed by third parties and are deployed under the Amazon Machine Instance framework, and businesses leverage these services to lower the costs of compute power for their business operations. AWS users can source these services from Amazon Marketplace AMIs, which are Amazon-verified vendors, or Community AMIs, which are unverified.      Read more: BlackBerry and Intel Tackle Cryptojacking Malware With New Detection Tool      Mitiga discovered this monero script in a Community AMI for a Windows 2008 Server while conducting a security audit for a financial services company. In its analysis, Mititga concluded that the AMI was created with the sole purpose of infecting devices with the mining malware, as the script was included in the AMI’s code from day one.      Outside of the financial services company that hired Mitiga to review the AMI, the cybersecurity firm is unaware of how many other entities and devices may be infected with the malware.      “As to how Amazon allows this to happen, well, this is the biggest question that arises from this discovery, but it's a question that should also be directed to AWS’s (sic) Comms team,” the team told CoinDesk over email.      CoinDesk reached out to Amazon Web Services to learn more about its approach to handling unverified AMI publishers but a representative declined to comment. Amazon Web Service's documentation includes the caveat that users choose to use Community AMIs ""at [their] own risk"" and that Amazon ""can't vouch for the integrity or security of [these] AMIs.""    One-off event or one of many?    Mitiga’s principal concern is that this malware could be one of several bugs worming around in unverified AMIs. The fact that Amazon does not provide transparent data regarding AWS use exacerbates this worry, the firm told CoinDesk.      “As AWS customer usage is obfuscated, we can’t know how far and wide this phenomenon stretches without AWS’s own investigation. We do however believe that the potential risk is high enough to issue a security advisory to all AWS customers using Community AMIs.”      Read more: North Korea Is Expanding Its Monero Mining Operations, Says Report      Mitiga recommends that any entity running a community AMI should terminate it immediately and search for a replacement from a trusted vendor. At the very least, businesses that rely on AWS should painstakingly review the code before integrating unverified AMIs into their business logic.      Mining malware could actually be the most innocuous form of infection a business may experience, the firm continued in the post. The worst-case scenario includes an AMI installing a backdoor on a business’ computer or ransomware that would encrypt the company’s files with the aim of extorting it for money to regain access.      The attack is the latest in a trend of so-called “crypto-jacking” attacks. Monero is the coin of choice among attackers thanks to its mining algorithm, which can be run easily using a computer’s CPU and GPU. When attackers infect enough computers and pool their resources, the collective hashpower is enough to merit a pretty payday.

42384465,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXYyh,1598007603,These Illicit SIM Cards Are Making Hacks Like Twitter's Easier,"Next time your phone rings and the caller ID says it’s your bank, telecom company or employer's IT department, it might be someone else.      That’s because little-discussed types of SIM cards offer the ability to spoof any number, can be encrypted and in some cases allows the user’s voice to be altered and cloaked. Such SIM cards are favored by criminals, and they can make social engineering attacks like those that struck Twitter last month easier to execute.      A SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card is essentially what stores information about a phone's user, including country, service provider and a unique idea that matches it to its owner.      While spoofing a phone number is an old trick, these SIMs offer a streamlined way to do it. They underscore the wide array of vulnerabilities companies and individuals face when trying to protect against social engineering attacks.      Twitter was the victim of a phone spear-phishing attack, in which a person posing as a company insider (often supposedly from the IT department) calls a real employee to extract information. That attack, which led to the takeover of 130 accounts, including high-profile ones such as Elon Musk and Kanye West, to scam their followers out of $120,000 worth of bitcoin, has brought increased attention to the practice. Tools like these SIMs are one way for attackers to try and stay ahead of suspecting companies.      See also: 'Crypto Instagram' Is Becoming a Thing, Scams and All      “Other companies might be a softer target for these same techniques,” said Allison Nixon, chief research officer at Unit221B, a cybersecurity firm. “And they're just not going to be prepared in the same way that battle-scarred telecommunications companies have been.”      Indeed, since the Twitter hack, there has reportedly been a rise in spear-phishing attacks across companies, individuals, and cryptocurrency exchanges.    White SIMs    The cards are known as White SIMs, owing to their color and lack of branding.      “White SIMs make it extremely easy to conduct outgoing spoofed calls,” said Hartej Sawhney, Principal at cybersecurity agency Zokyo. “They are illegal basically everywhere.”      Given the wide array of services SIMs such as these offer, they make social engineering just a little easier, and sometimes that's all an attacker needs. SIMS can generally be bought on the Dark Web or related sites, using bitcoin.      Social engineering often relies on an attacker tricking someone into doing something he or she shouldn’t. It can look as simple as a phishing attack, but can also involve more elaborate means such as SIM swapping, voice spoofing or extensive phone conversations, all to gain access to someone’s information or data.      See also: Student Gets 10-Year Jail Term for SIM-Swap Crypto Thefts Worth $7.5 Million      For years the cryptocurrency community has been the target of SIM swaps, a subset of social engineering. It involves an attacker fooling a telecommunications company employee into porting the victim’s number to the attacker’s device, which lets them bypass two-factor authentication protections to an exchange account or social media profile.      “Spoof calling is a flaw at the protocol layer and is not something that can be fixed overnight. It requires essentially rewriting the internet,” said Sawhney. “What's interesting to note is that 99% of telecom employees have access to all customer accounts, meaning you only need to social engineer one of them.”      These SIMs present challenges for those working to protect against social engineering, including banks and other financial institutions.    A business like any other    Social engineering attackers pick their targets by weighing the money, time and effort required to dupe them against the payoff, said Paul Walsh, CEO of the cybersecurity company MetaCert.      “It's easier, cheaper and faster to compromise a person through social engineering than it is to try and take advantage of a computer or computer network,” said Walsh. “So any tools or processes like these that make that job quicker and easier for them is obviously good, in their eyes.”      The ability to mimic a specific phone number is what makes these SIMs dangerous. For example, spam callers often spoof their number to make it seem they’re calling from a number in the recipient's local area. But these SIM cards allow an attacker to spoof a specific number, making it more likely someone will answer the phone.      See also: A New Ultrasonic Hack Can Exploit Your Siri      A person with a number-spoofing SIM could easily imitate the number of Bank of America, for example, said Walsh, making it more likely people would give out sensitive personal information. If the number comes up as Bank of America, why would you have reason to immediately think otherwise?      Walsh also said a lot of systems will automatically detect the number you're calling from, and use that as a piece of information verifying your identity.      “So you call your bank and if you can confirm with your phone number and maybe one other piece of information, you gain access to all kinds of information like your bank balance and last transaction,” said Walsh. “That information alone might be useful in the context of social engineering by calling the bank without additional information you need to target someone, and acquiring it through the bank.”    Voice-mimicking tech on the way    What concerns Haseeb Awan, CEO of Efani, a company that specifically works to protect against SIM hacks, is the way these SIMs might be used with other tech, such as voice spoofing. Technology that can be used to recreate someone’s voice is readily available online, and people’s voices can be reconstructed from just a few snippets of speech.      “If you’re able to replicate anyone’s voice, and couple that with their phone number, that’s what starts to worry me the most,” said Awan. “A lot of companies are now using your voice as an authentication method, so this is where the risk of fraud is going to get really high.”      See also: North Korean Hackers Ramp Up Efforts to Steal Crypto Amid Coronavirus Pandemic      And while most people might think they’d be able to tell if someone's voice was altered, or sounded off, Awan, who was born in Pakistan but lives in the U.S., is quick to point out the tech has gotten so good he’s seen it able to replicate his accent. In fact, one study found our brains fare poorly at differentiating a fake voice from a real one, even when we’re told it is going to be fake.      Unlike the near-universally illegal White SIMs, encrypted anonymous SIMs that also alter your voice in real time can be easily purchased in the open. For example, the U.K. company Secure Sims, which did not respond to a request for comment by press time, offers one for sale that disables your location and encrypts data, among a variety of other features.      It’s listed for sale for £600-£1,000 ($794-$1,322).",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/21/these-illicit-sim-cards-are-making-hacks-like-twitters-easier,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e69fd5141a146514be0df475587f7299c9c24eb6-2560x2017.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384460,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXYtf,1598004053,Bitcoin in Cuba: A Local YouTube Influencer Explains How It Works,"It’s hard to participate in the influencer economy from Cuba, but YouTuber Erich García Cruz is making it work.      “We do not have access to Visa cards or Mastercard products because of the [U.S. trade] embargo,” Cruz explained. “We are monetized through YouTube.”      Bitcoin is one of many tools he uses to turn those dollar earnings, in foreign bank accounts, into rent and grocery money in Cuba. Most of the freelancers around the world using bitcoin as borderless money appear to be programmers or other types of technical workers. However, Cruz is among the slowly growing number of content creators relying on bitcoin as well.      Cruz monetized his tech-centric YouTube channel back in November 2019 and started working with bitcoin around July 2020, inspired by tales from local friends. It’s harder to move around and do business outside these days, in Cuba as it is everywhere. Meanwhile, Cruz said more people in the local tech community are learning about bitcoin.      “Thousands of Cubans buy cards at Bitrefill to consume those digital services by paying with cryptocurrencies. There is no other way,” Cruz said.    Bitcoin in Cuba    It’s impossible to say definitively how many people in Cuba use bitcoin. Brazil-based Cuban expat Claudia Rodriguez said her exchange served nearly 7,000 Cuban user accounts by November 2019. As of August 2020, she said, the exchange’s operations there stopped for legal reasons, including a lack of regulatory clarity from the Central Bank of Cuba.      Read more: Cuba Eyes Cryptocurrency as Solution to Sanctions, Financial Woes      “Due to the economic crisis caused by the pandemic and the new restrictions in Cuba, cryptocurrencies can be an efficient solution,” Rodriguez said. “It is a shame that we cannot continue to support the community at this time.”      Regardless, Cruz estimated there are now roughly 50,000 Cuban bitcoin users in this socialist nation of roughly 11.3 million people. He, like many Cubans sanctioned by the U.S., doesn't acquire bitcoin through exchanges. Instead, Cruz earns his money abroad, with the help of a relative. The relative may send Cruz bitcoin as remittances or other forms of money as well.      “The money earned in Cuba is exchanged in the informal market to later buy [goods] in state-run or private stores,” Cruz said. “There [are] Cubans even making money with [both crypto and fiat] trading.”    Influencer economy    Cruz said his reliance on bitcoin swiftly went from 10% of his earnings to now a third of his household income.      Looking for products and services to manage his newfound crypto showed him there’s an opportunity for his YouTube channel to monetize Spanish-language crypto content.      Read more: Bitcoin in Emerging Markets: Latin America      “I realized that all these [crypto] platforms are simply pyramid schemes and scams that take advantage of ignorance,” Cruz said. “That is why I considered addressing those issues on [my] Bachecubano channel, to offer our correct point of view on how to use them.”      Cruz is now one of a small and widely dispersed group of Latin American influencers who use bitcoin for their daily work.      Read more: ‘Crypto Instagram’ Is Becoming a Thing, Scams and All      Fabiano Dias, vice president of business development at the startup Bitwage, said a couple of Latin American YouTubers use bitcoin as an international payments tool.      “We also serve YouTube streamers, which are few in numbers but large in volumes. It’s up to $20,000 a month for some of them,” Dias said, adding they are a minority among hundreds of monthly users from the tech industry.      Overall, Dias said Bitwage facilitated $2 million worth of transactions in July 2020, including work with companies like Paxful, half of which was in bitcoin. Dozens of YouTubers rely on Bitwage for fiat money management, especially in Argentina and Brazil. A couple of them use it for acquiring bitcoin as well. To be clear: Bitwage does not service Cuba or other countries sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

Geneva's Mt Pelerin and Zug-based Crypto Finance AG and 21 Analytics announced Friday that 21 CHF worth of bitcoin (~$23) had been sent in a live demonstration of a new transaction that automatically complied with the AML requirements set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and Swiss markets regulators.  The transaction took place late Thursday.  FATF holds virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to the same standards as traditional bank transfers.  Known as the Travel Rule, the FATF standard requires VASPs to exchange data that identifies both the originator and the beneficiary on any transaction over $1,000.  Since the rule came into force last year, intermediaries have so far been forced to do this manually – but the live demonstration shows that transactions now can be sent with all the AML details automatically added.  “The transfer was fully automated using TRP [Travel Rule Protocol], instead of manually creating PDFs and sending that for each transaction, which happened to be the case for FINMA-regulated Swiss VASPs so far,” Lucas Betschart, CEO and founder of 21 Analytics, said in an email.  The live demonstration – viewable here – between Crypto Finance and Mt Pelerin was powered by 21 Analytics’ AI regtech, and ran over Swiss FATF travel rule system OpenVASP and the TRP, another institution-focused solution led by ING Bank.

42394459,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvkTBT,1597996854,Bitcoin Has Lost Its Way: Here’s How to Return to Crypto’s Subversive Roots,"Rachel-Rose O'Leary is a cryptocurrency writer and trainee C++ developer at PolyTech. Currently a contributor to CoinDesk and the Defiant newsletter, she has written about cryptocurrency since 2015. She holds an MA in digital art and philosophy.  These days I spend most of my time tweaking the code of a bitcoin wallet that runs in Terminal. Based on Libbitcoin, it’s built to work over Nym Technologies’ anonymizing mixnet. I call it the Dark Renaissance wallet.  It’s mostly a learning exercise to hone my C++ skills, but the Dark Renaissance wallet is a harbinger for what is to come.  Working with a small, focused and ideological team, my comrades at PolyTech are upending some of the key assumptions on which the crypto industry has been built, and are plotting an all-out privacy offensive.  Our mission – the Dark Renaissance – is strategic and philosophical. At a personal level, it relates to a lifelong obsession with the philosophy of technology, and an intense awareness of the power of software.  It represents a desire to reconnect with bitcoin’s crypto-anarchist roots and fend off the forces of surveillance that creep into every aspect of our lives in 2020.  But first, it requires an understanding of the distant past.  Code as magic  Like the ancient Irish poets, the filí, programmers have the ability to alter reality with an utterance. Code is an incantation, an act of summoning ideas and inclinations into material reality. It is a conduit between the sphere of ideation and that of politics and sociality.  But technology isn’t merely the product of ideas – it actively shapes belief systems, reconfiguring the world in which it is applied.  Programmers know this: When a user’s behavior is influenced by code, it’s called opinionated software. When a user is manipulated for corporate interests, it is known as a dark pattern.  Software also has unintended consequences. Released into the wild, code propagates ideology in unpredictable and chaotic ways. Inevitably, it backfires, and innovation flows through human society, irrespective of, and indifferent to, political difference.  To what extent technology is informed by and produces belief systems has haunted me throughout my adult life.  It has caused me nightmares: dark conclusions on the nature of technology, prophecies of machine takeover and terrifying visions of the future of war.  It has also given me dreams. I believe it is within humanity’s power to reshape the narrative by which technology is formed. In doing so, it becomes possible to take back the reins of runaway technological innovation and re-orientate human destiny.  Crypto is at the front line of this struggle.  Crypto philosophy  I came to crypto through encryption. I saw hash functions as a kind of abstract poetry that spoke of the secrecy of nature and the unknown.  Crypto was immersed in a romantic glow. In Ethereum’s early days, I believed I was witnessing the emergence of Skynet. It was the promise of Turing Complete, general computation and if artificial intelligence was going to emerge anywhere, it would be there, I believed at the time.  It was my doomer phase, and Ethereum was a source of dark fascination. Inspired by the Ethereum yellow paper, I wrote my master’s thesis in 2016 on what I felt was a sadomasochistic dynamic between natural language and code. It included an erotic poem featuring a kind of vampire DAO (far before I had familiarized myself with the unicorns and rainbows that better represent the Ethereum community).  But while my approach was unconventional, the idea dates back to a problem as old as philosophy itself. To borrow a metaphor from computers, human experience consists of abstractions: mere interfaces that we interact with. Base reality occurs on a lower level, corresponding to hardware and raw machine code.  This hierarchization of reality – of partitioning nature into the more and less real – occurs across philosophy in different guises and names. For some philosophers, such a partition gets us no further in understanding the “things-in-themselves.” Humans are encased by a sphere of representation, wholly cut off from an inaccessible and inhuman outside.  At the time, I believed the reality hierarchy had a linguistic equivalent. At the bottom were operational languages such as computer programming. At the top were descriptive, natural languages.  With this philosophical backdrop, code acquires a profound metaphysical weight. It became a way to transmute the lowest level of reality into human experience.  The DAO hack was the first crack in this worldview.  Inhuman intelligence  Implicitly, I maintained at the time that natural language was somehow inferior to the perfect objectivity of code.  Not only that, but I believed the behavior of technology within capitalism – its tendency toward monopolization, value-extraction and surveillance – was technology’s true nature revealing itself.  Martin Heidegger – a philosopher known for supporting the Nazi party and for transforming Western philosophy – calls this tendency Gestell, or enframing.  According to Heidegger, technology is a process of dismantling, quantifying and repackaging for export. In modernity, it has captured humanity, reducing people and everything else into a resource, a “standing reserve” to be exploited by the technological regime.  The DAO episode exposed many myths about blockchain, but this one stands out: Despite claims to the contrary, crypto contains an inextricably human element.  An equally controversial philosopher called Nick Land takes this process and gives it an agency.  According to Land, technology exposes an inhuman intelligence optimizing itself at the expense of the human. Stimulated by finance and a strange, contorting temporality, this inhuman intelligence is climbing its way up the reality hierarchy, threatening to replace the human as the world’s top predator.  It might sound like science fiction but crypto is full of this kind of rhetoric. Early efforts toward smart contracts promise nothing short of optimizing humans out of the equation. The blockchain is described as pure, trustless and incorruptible, turning all that it touches into glacial, inalterable code.  Ethereum’s infamous experiment in corporate governance, The DAO, echoed this language.  As Ethereum Classic fans will no doubt remember, The DAO was a high-profile fundraising campaign for a decentralized incubator. Its marketing spoke of “the steadfast iron will of unstoppable code” – a phrase whose irony is hard to forget.  Due to a vulnerability discovered in Solidity smart contracts not long after its launch, The DAO was subject to a re-entrancy attack, in which a hacker exploited a function within the code to drain 3.6 million ether out of it.  Following a heated discussion that resulted in the birth of a new cryptocurrency, ethereum classic (ETC), Ethereum developers implemented a controversial upgrade to refund DAO investors.  The DAO episode exposed many myths about blockchain, but this one stands out: Despite claims to the contrary, crypto contains an inextricably human element.  Not quite Skynet  I spent the subsequent years following the ebb and flow of Ethereum software development as a reporter for CoinDesk.  For two years I attended every single Ethereum core developer call. I tracked decision-making on the platform like a jealous lover, refreshing Twitter handles, expanding sprawling GitHub discussions, quietly watching chat groups.  During this time, Ethereum faced the fallout of its DAO refund and dealt with the challenge of informal, decentralized governance. This challenge was intensified by a few simple facts: Ethereum has a leadership that is ideologically opposed to authority, and a vision that is inclusive to the point of being meandering.  Criticisms aside, Ethereum was in uncharted territory. And despite the odds, the platform managed to keep its course, even with pressure from monetary interest pulling it from each side.  Over time, I understood the mistakes I had made. Ethereum is not Skynet, and code has much more in common with natural languages than the raw mechanics of primary nature. I learned that sometimes, developers actually trade efficiency for readability; favoring clear, modular code over code which is fast.  The general effort toward compliance was not only enabling certain forms of oppression but at times actively supporting it.  I also learned power exists on all decentralized networks, but it is typically nameless and therefore unaccountable. Over time, power relations solidify. Networks become institutionalized and the rift between users and developers deepens.  Software, I decided, is a social good, like water and clean air. To maintain the balance of power, coders must elevate those around them. They must discourage passive user-ship, inspire users to become active network participants and train the next generation of coders to replace them.  Democratic modernity  Armed with a newly found focus, I left the Ethereum beat to join the Rojava revolution in North Syria.  Inspired by the writings of Kurdish ideologue Abdullah Ocalan, the Rojava revolution sprang up during the Syrian Civil War. Its supporters maintain that the nation-state is an abstraction badly suited to the Middle East. In its place, Rojava is pioneering new forms of decentralized social organization.  But it is not merely a social organization that binds Rojava together. Rather, Rojava is governed by a collective idea: the concept of democratic modernity.  In his five-book manifesto written from Turkish prison island İmralı, Ocalan essentially agrees with Heidegger’s “Gestell” – there is a reductive, exploitative process at work within modernity.  But Ocalan does not identify this process with technology. According to him, it is the logic of capitalist civilization itself.  The task of democratic modernity is to decouple technology from globalization. In its place, new modernities can be built, based on a plurality of logics – not merely Western-style reductionism that has come to dominate the world.  In Rojava, learning is paramount. People are encouraged to develop “xwe zanîn,” or self-knowledge, inspired by the Ancient Greek maxim “know thyself.” This is a project of remembering, of resurfacing histories worn away by globalization.  Here, I spent my time establishing technical academies. Inspired by the scientific centers of the ancient world, like Plato’s Academy and the House of Baghdad, our goal was to train a new generation of philosophical programmers.  But my time in Rojava was cut short.  During the nine months I spent there, the risk of a Turkish invasion weighed heavily. It cast a dark shadow across all of our work, like a storm cloud looming in the distance.  Finally, the storm came, and the sky rained bullets and bombs. Disguised as a man, I was among the last foreigners to cross the border to safety before the death count started to rise.  Bad trip  I found myself at the Devcon5 Ethereum conference in Osaka, Japan, one week after leaving Syria.  With friends on the front line, I found it hard to look people in the eye. Ethereum’s unicorn-punk aesthetic set against the backdrop of war was hard to stomach.  Sleeplessly refreshing the Syrian Civil War subreddit and Syria Live Map on my phone, I watched the war play out in total horror.  Airstrikes, bombings, body counts. On stage, well-meaning developers called for diversity and social justice, innocent to, or oblivious of, the blanket of physical safety that surrounded them.  By suppressing its crypto-anarchist roots and whitewashing its aims to appeal to bankers, crypto has cut itself off from its source of power.  It was overpriced and sparsely attended. At a panel on Ethereum-based mixers an audience member warned that facilitating “bad guys” through privacy-tech could alienate the “average user” – a statement that was met with broad approval.  Maybe it was my state of mind, but it felt like the dissonance between cryptocurrency’s stated aims and its material reality was reaching a fever pitch. The general effort toward compliance was not only enabling certain forms of oppression but at times actively supporting it.  At that moment, I decided that anonymity is where all philosophy of technology collides. In technical terms, it is synonymous with freedom. Practically, it can mean life or death.  The Dark Renaissance  Since then, I have set about orchestrating the Dark Renaissance.  The Dark Renaissance is a revolution within cryptocurrency. It is a rallying cry to all who still believe in crypto’s true potential. It calls for a rebirth back to bitcoin’s original principles: to be autonomous, censorship-resistant and dark-by-design.  While crypto-anarchist in origin, bitcoin has lost its way. Rather than empowering black markets, it has allied with state and corporate interests – traded its radical potential for mainstream adoption.  But by suppressing its crypto-anarchist roots and whitewashing its aims to appeal to bankers, crypto has cut itself off from its source of power. The Dark Renaissance seeks to resurface that power, to allow the truly disruptive potential of cryptocurrency to realize itself.  That truly disruptive potential lies in cryptocurrency’s ability to extend the space of freedom outward: to increase the remit and power of free market activity and strip resources away from the nation-state.  Our methods are part educational, part software production. We are setting up the PolyTech Academy, where technical skills are taught in tandem with a philosophy curriculum.  Read more: Code as a Weapon: Amir Taaki Wants You to Join the Real Crypto Revolution  Through education, we want to elevate the culture of the cryptocurrency space, to create a community of active network participants and to inspire a new generation of programmers to succeed us.  In our code, we build tools to practically enforce our ideology. Advocating autonomy, anonymity and censorship-resistance, we will lead with the launch of several financial products, and iterate into a full-fledged dark financial system.  These tools will enable us to create a new economic paradigm. We are building financial networks to disintermediate local economies away from the state and large banks, and to usher in a more democratic alternative.  Rather than controlling people through mechanism design as much crypto-economics often intends to do, we are instead seeking to inspire people – to create a vision of technology that empowers people from within.  We are in the midst of a turning point. Technologists today are faced with a choice: Either passively advance the interests of a system fated for destruction or undertake a psychic reversal.

42384454,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXYpt,1597971014,INX Crypto Exchange to Launch $117M IPO Next Week,"INX Ltd. said it will launch its long-awaited landmark initial public offering (IPO) as soon as Monday, capping a nearly two-year journey for the startup cryptocurrency and security token exchange.    ""It is anticipated that the offering will begin on Aug. 24, 2020, or shortly thereafter,"" the Gibraltar-based company said in a press release Thursday.  Also Thursday, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) posted a notice of effectiveness, officially clearing the sale.  As previously reported, INX has priced its 130 million tokens, which are to run on the Ethereum blockchain, at $0.90 each, totaling $117 million in gross proceeds. This was smack in the middle of the target range of $0.80 to $1.00 per token.  After offering expenses and fees to advisory firm A-Labs, the sale would net up to $111 million, according to INX's latest filing with the SEC.    The net proceeds would be used to:    Build INX Trading Solutions, a regulated exchange for cryptocurrencies, security tokens and derivatives.  Build a cash fund to protect the company and its customers in the event of a data breach, trading execution error or counterparty default.    The instruments on offer are a hybrid of utility and security tokens.    Investors could use them to pay trading fees on INX's platform.  The tokens would also entitle holders to a share of company profits.    INX's sale would mark a milestone for the blockchain industry.    It would be the first security token offering (STO) registered with the SEC, and thus legally marketable to mom-and-pop investors.  Previous STOs were unregistered and limited to wealthy investors, with the issuers simply filing notices to the regulator; the initial coin offerings (ICO) of the 2017-2018 boom were conducted with little if any regard for compliance.  INX's sale would also be one of very few IPOs in the blockchain industry and almost certainly the largest.    It's been a long road for the company, whose U.S. operations are led by Executive Managing Director Alan Silbert. (His brother Barry is the CEO of Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.)    INX first signaled its intent to go public with a draft registration statement submitted in January 2018.  The company filed its F-1 prospectus (the SEC's form for foreign issuers) almost exactly a year ago.  To comply with know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, INX has written a smart contract that allows only wallet addresses belonging to investors that have been vetted and put on a ""whitelist"" to receive the tokens.  TokenSoft, a registration agent that specializes in blockchain token offerings, is doing the KYC checks and maintaining the registry of investors.  Last month, INX hired Paz Diamant as its chief technology officer, regulatory filings show. Diamant is the former managing director of R&D and product at eToro, where he built the brokerage's crypto trading system, according to his LinkedIn profile.
