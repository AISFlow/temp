42424198,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2lQHh,1638228652,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Rebound Continues Into Third Day Amid Lessening Omicron Fears,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin led the crypto market to its third straight day of recovery from a “Black Friday” sell-off amid diminishing fears  Technician’s take: Short-term momentum is improving, although buyers will need to clear $60K to sustain the uptrend.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $57,990  Ether (ETH): $4,445  Markets  S&P 500: $4,655 +1.3%  Dow Jones Industrial Average: $35,135 +0.6%  Nasdaq: $15,782 +1.8%  Gold: $1,782 -0.5%  Market moves  Bitcoin led the crypto market to its third straight day of gains, after a steep drop by more than 8% on “Black Friday.” The No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose to nearly $59,000 on Monday before it sank toward the $58,000 level again.  But bitcoin’s trading volume was much lower compared with last Monday across major centralized exchanges. As discussed in Monday’s Asia First Mover, investors are waiting for the latest updates about the omicron coronavirus strain and its potential impact on the global markets, crypto included.  One analyst, however, said investors in Asia, especially in China, are less affected by Omicron’s developments.  “During the past few days ... it is not so [panicky] for Asia market,” Rachel Lin, CEO of DeFi derivatives platform SynFutures, said, pointing out that China’s major A-share market closed with few changes on Friday.  A report by Bloomberg says that China’s COVID-zero strategy may have helped its equity market from any potential hurt from the Omicron strain.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Returns Above $58K as Momentum Improves  Bitcoin (BTC) is holding support above its 100-day moving average, currently around $54,200, as last week’s sell-off stabilizes.  The cryptocurrency was trading around $58,000 at press time and could face initial resistance at $60,000-$63,000.  Price momentum is starting to recover on the daily chart, which suggests buyers could remain active into the Asia trading day. Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is near oversold levels similar to what occurred in late September, which preceded a price rally.  For now, buyers will need to clear resistance in order to yield further upside targets. Longer-term indicators have shifted neutral as buyers failed to sustain an all-time high near $69,000 over the past month.

This comes despite the negative news that has surrounded the digital asset following news of mid-sized crypto exchange eToro demising the altcoin for U.S. users. This has sent the price of the asset barreling downwards towards points that had not been touched in the past three months. The downtrend in the cryptocurrency had opened up an opportunity for investors to snatch up ADA at discounted prices before the expected bounce back. In addition to expected releases of decentralized applications (DApps) on the blockchain, activity has ramped up among investors.

42424178,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2lPhh,1638222688,NY Fed Launches Fintech Research Wing With BIS Help,"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York launched the New York Innovation Center (NYIC) to build and test new financial technology, including central bank digital currencies (CBDC), stablecoins and cross-border payments, the central bank division announced Monday.  The NYIC is the result of a strategic partnership between the New York Fed and the Bank for International Settlements’ (BIS) Innovation Center. Jerome Powell, chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, said the innovation center will foster collaboration and the sharing of expertise among central banks, during a virtual event marking the launch of the NYIC.  “In particular, the partnership will support our analysis of digital currencies, including central bank digital currencies, help to improve our current payment system, with a particular focus on making cross-border payments faster and less expensive,” Powell said.  According to the announcement of the launch, the NYIC plans to focus on five so-called opportunity areas: supervisory and regulatory technology, financial market infrastructures, future of money, open finance and climate risk. The NYIC will be led by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) alum Per von Zelowitz, who joined the New York Fed in July.  Zelowitz said during the virtual event that one of the five focus-areas, the future of money, relates to the center’s work on digital currencies. CBDCs are a critical area of focus, according to Zelowitz.  “But [this] could also include work specific to stablecoins and cryptocurrencies and other areas that might be relevant from our perspective,” Zelowitz said.  The NYIC will join the growing list of BIS innovation hubs, which already includes Singapore, Switzerland and Hong Kong. Earlier this year, the Hong Kong innovation center’s work on a prototype involving multiple CBDCs showed that digital currencies and distributed ledger technology could potentially facilitate cheaper and safer cross-border payments. Next year, 22 industry heavyweights, including Goldman Sachs and HSBC, will pilot this multi-CBDC platform (called the mBridge project) across multiple jurisdictions.  “The hub is not a think tank, it is a laboratory. It builds proofs-of-concept and prototypes using new technologies. It organizes hackathons to engage with the entire community, scout technologies and source ideas for projects,” said Agustín Carstens, general manager at BIS, during the event.  BIS plans to open more hubs in Canada and the euro system, Carstens said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/29/ny-fed-launches-fintech-research-wing-with-bis-help,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22914b984f3d9f051bb0af3cc0d320cfc8b91a09-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The owners of Italian-built Vianne said in a statement Monday that prospective buyers will be able to buy the vessel with bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), dogecoin (DOGE) as well as SOL, FTM, BNB or “top tier” non-fungible tokens (NFT) from the CryptoPunk or Bored Ape Yacht Club collections.  That said, a 10% fiat deposit is required.  Vianne is listed for $10 million and can be chartered this winter for $196,000 per week in the Caribbean. She features a sky-deck jacuzzi and can accommodate 12 guests.  “Whilst cryptocurrency payments are increasing in the yachting industry, this would make Vianne the largest-ever yacht to be purchased with NFTs,” the vessel’s owners said in a statement.  The ability to pay for this superyacht with cryptocurrency is a sign of a broader embrace by the luxury goods industry – be it Dolce & Gabbana or Sotheby’s.

Back on the high seas, the owners of Vianne say crypto is already a reality.  “In the last 12 months, especially, we have leaned towards transacting using crypto, where relevant and possible,” the owner’s family office told CoinDesk via email. “We are in the process of procuring a larger yacht for the owner, and if/when we do transact, we would definitely be paying in crypto (stablecoins, [altcoins], etc.) if it is an option.”",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | ETH | FIAT,Michael Bellusci,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/29/for-sale-10m-yacht-doge-accepted,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1090ec6f4602095b5b76ae08a21feb1aa439ea0-1280x909.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424188,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2lPzh,1638221432,Investment Firm Kelly Files for Ether Futures ETF,"Kelly Strategic Management, an investment firm headed by Kevin Kelly, has filed for approval in the U.S. of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tied to ether futures, just three months after ProShares and VanEck pulled similar filings.  The Kelly Ethereum Ether Strategy ETF is an actively managed fund that will invest in cash-settled Ether futures contracts traded on registered commodity exchanges. The value of futures contracts is tied to the underlying reference asset, which is ether in this case. “Cash-settled” means that if the futures contract expires with ether’s value above the futures contract price, the purchaser pays the seller the difference in cash.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is currently the only commodity exchange where ether futures are traded. The CME’s current position limits for ether futures contracts are 8,000 contracts for an applicable month with each contract representing 50 ether. If the Kelly fund hits those limits, it will invest in longer-dated ether contracts or additional cash and fixed income investments like government bonds or corporate debt securities such as short-term promissory notes.  In August, VanEck and ProShares suddenly withdrew their applications for their futures-based ether ETFs, which suggested they received pushback from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates ETFs.  Last month, two bitcoin futures-based ETFs from ProShares and Valkyrie went public with the SEC’s approval after Chair Gary Gensler said the funds provided sufficient investor protections.

42424200,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2lQJh,1638221268,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Bears Retreat as Traders Buy on Dips,"Bitcoin was in recovery mode on Monday as bearish sentiment waned. The cryptocurrency was up about 6% over the past 24 hours compared with a 7% gain in ether over the same period. Generally, some traders are looking to buy on price dips given seasonal strength into year’s end.  “If indeed [the sell-off] is over, such a pullback could clear the way for growth to new highs, as bulls were allowed to lock in profits and shortly after to buy the dip,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “On the other hand, BTC remains below its 50-day average (currently around $60K), which has acted as resistance for the past 10 days. A failed breakout would indicate the end of bitcoin’s bullish trend,” Kuptsikevich wrote.  Some analysts expect crypto volatility to continue lower, which means limited downside with the potential for higher price gains.  “We are betting that the market will consolidate instead of breaking lower. So we are taking the opportunity to short [volatility] in BTC and ETH,” crypto hedge fund QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram announcement.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $58,221, +5.9%  Ether (ETH): $4,426, +6.9%  S&P 500: +1.3%  Gold: $1,786, -0.5%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.514%  Volatility is relatively low  On an annualized basis, bitcoin and ether’s 30-day volatility remains low compared with earlier this year. Meanwhile, despite the latest spike, the S&P 500′s annualized volatility has declined from its March 2020 peak.  Some analysts expect volatility to eventually rise next year, especially as the correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 remains elevated. For now, pullbacks in assets deemed to be risky, such as cryptocurrencies and stocks, appear to be limited given strong seasonal trends.  Bitcoin drawdown deepens  Bitcoin dropped nearly 20% from its all-time high near $69,000 last week, which was the largest drawdown (percentage decline from peak to trough) since September. Historically, bitcoin experienced sharp drawdowns around all-time highs, which suggests the current correction could be short-lived.  The chart below shows previous sell-offs resulting in drawdowns as deep as 24% have quickly recovered toward the all-time price high.  Crypto fund inflows rise  Crypto investment fund inflows rose to $306 million last week despite the overall market pullback. Bitcoin-focused funds saw the largest inflows in five weeks, totaling $247 million following the launch of another investment product in Europe, according to a report by CoinShares.  Multi-asset investment products and funds focused on alternative cryptocurrencies also saw inflows last week.  Altcoin roundup  Binance resolves DOGE wallet issue, unfreezing over 1,000 user accounts: Binance said on Monday it has resolved technical issues with its dogecoin wallet that resulted in users’ accounts being frozen, reported CoinDesk’s Anna Baydakova. In a blog post, Binance blamed the issue on “a combination of unlikely factors” related to the dogecoin blockchain upgrade from the previous version. “What began as a fairly straightforward upgrade turned into an issue where Binance users were unable to withdraw DOGE for the last 17 days,” the exchange said.  Mean DAO raises $3.5 million for Solana-based DeFi payments project: Mean DAO has raised a $3.5 million funding round to boost Solana’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem with a new payments protocol focused on money streaming.

42394358,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcDRH,1638217892,Planet of the Bored Apes,"The technology behind NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, hasn’t changed all that much since the development of the ERC-721 standard – the coding framework on which most popular crypto collectibles are built.  That’s because until 2021, NFTs were mostly a niche curiosity for crypto enthusiasts. Even with the rise of CryptoKitties in 2017, NFTs didn’t immediately conjure up any cultural or aesthetic reference points beyond the broader crypto ecosystem – despite becoming a media hang-up.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  With the success of Bored Ape Yacht Club – the collection of crude, cartoonish, monkey-themed images that’s birthed a rising media empire over the past year – those dynamics have started to shift.  When the digital artist Beeple helped kick off the current mania around NFTs last winter, most of the popular NFTs on marketplaces like Nifty Gateway and SuperRare nodded to the standard crypto meme lexicon: bitcoins, rocket ships, “bulls” and Pepe the Frog. Things started to shift when CryptoPunks started popping up on physical billboards across America, and at Christie’s.  Now we’re in what you might call the “Bored Ape Yacht Club Era” of NFT art history. The success of BAYC gave rise to other animal-themed “10k” NFT collections (so named for their limited supply of 10,000 procedurally generated images), which took the formula and ran with it; Lazy Lions, Cool Cats, Pudgy Penguins and the Doge Pound are some of the pricier projects in this vein.  Visually, they’re all strikingly similar: portraits at a three-quarter angle, from the shoulders up. They often double as headshot-style profile pictures on social media sites.  Post Malone, Jimmy Fallon, Lil Baby and Steph Curry are among today’s most prominent ape owners, thanks to clever celebrity outreach programs from crypto platforms like MoonPay.  This past weekend, the rapper Future picked up a Bored Ape (also through MoonPay) and was gifted a “Doodle” NFT by one of the collection’s founders. He even dropped a tweet to go along with it: “WAGMI,” or we’re all gonna make it, a common crypto rallying cry.  For now, this is what NFTs are, culturally. Mainstream consumers with a peripheral knowledge of NFTs aren’t thinking about Folia’s generative art experiments, or Hic et Nunc’s relatively diverse digital art collection, or even Meebits, the 3D NFT project from the creators of CryptoPunks that riffs on digital minimalism. Bored Apes, with their overwhelming aesthetic sameness and their all-important community aspect, are the blueprint, as they have been for the better part of this year.  Of course, there are plenty of reasons to doubt whether BAYC will remain on top. The crypto market tends to move in cycles; if everything suddenly crashes, new NFT paradigms may emerge.  Read more: CryptoPunks Get Punked | Opinion  There’s also the fact that Bored Ape-style NFTs are almost universally unappealing to look at (Lazy Lions, especially – Cool Cats get a pass, I think they’re kind of sweet). A Bored Ape spin-off collection called Mutant Ape Yacht Club takes those uncanny visuals to a grotesque extreme. It’s as if they’re daring you to mock them, to question how anyone could spend so much on these images.  That the BAYC template has created real cultural impact beyond crypto is why it remains immensely successful, and it will always have a place in the canon for that reason. But there’s no reason it needs to continue to dominate to the exclusion of everything else.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/29/planet-of-the-bored-apes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7267941d48b4d214211c5041b5ea31b38f3ec9c0-1160x816.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411867,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgiev,1638212189,What Is Cryptocurrency?,"Cryptocurrency is a relatively new type of money that operates in a completely different way than the traditional currency we all use every day. The most basic difference is that it’s exclusively a virtual currency, meaning there are no physical cryptocurrency coins or notes you can keep in your back pocket.  It’s also issued, or created, in a unique way. Instead of being produced by a central bank or government, like U.S. dollars, euros and other fiat currencies are, new cryptocurrency units typically enter circulation through a technological process that involves the participation of volunteers from all over the world using their computers.  That is why cryptocurrency is often described as “decentralized.” Cryptocurrencies are typically not controlled or operated by any single entity in any single country. It takes an entire network of volunteers from around the world to secure and validate transactions made with cryptocurrency.  But it isn’t just they’re digital nature and how they’re issued that sets cryptocurrencies apart from regular currencies; there are other differences:  Regulation: The global financial system has been based on various fiat currencies for centuries and most countries have a mature set of laws and best practices to regulate their use. Cryptocurrency, however, is a largely unregulated market, and even when regulations exist they can vary by jurisdiction.  Speed and cost: Sending and completing cross-border transactions using cryptocurrency is much faster than using the legacy banking system. Instead of taking several business days, transactions can occur within minutes, often at a fraction of the cost, when compared with using fiat currency.  Supply: Fiat money has an unlimited supply. That means governments and central banks are free to print new currency at will during times of financial crisis. Cryptocurrencies, however, usually have a predictable supply determined by an algorithm. Many cryptocurrencies are coded to include a supply limit (though some don’t). For example, bitcoin – the world’s first cryptocurrency and the largest by market capitalization – has a maximum supply of 21 million tokens that are released at a steady and predictable rate. That means once the number of bitcoin in circulation reaches 21 million, the protocol will cease releasing new coins into circulation.  Immutable: Unlike transactions involving fiat currencies, all completed crypto transactions are permanent and final. It is virtually impossible to reverse crypto transactions once they have been added to the ledger.  What puts the ‘crypto’ in cryptocurrency?  The word “crypto” in cryptocurrency refers to the special system of encrypting and decrypting information – known as cryptography – which is used to secure all transactions sent between users. Cryptography plays a vitally important role in allowing users to freely transact tokens and coins between one another without the need for an intermediary like a bank to keep track of each person’s balance and ensure the network remains secure.  It also solves a problem that used to make middlemen like banks indispensable – the double-spend issue: when a person attempts to spend the same balance twice with two different parties.  Cryptocurrencies use cryptography to encrypt sensitive information, including the private keys – long alphanumeric strings of characters – of crypto holders. Think of private keys as the passwords that determine the ownership of cryptocurrencies. Keep in mind that cryptocurrencies cannot be stored outside of the blockchain. They are permanently based on the blockchain. Hence, when someone says they own X amount of coins, what they really mean is that their password can legitimately claim X amount of coins on the blockchain.  These private keys are what crypto holders store on their wallets, which, as you must have guessed, are special kinds of software or devices designed specifically for this purpose. In instances where a crypto holder loses access to his or her private key, the cryptocurrencies associated with such keys could be lost permanently.  With the help of a cryptographic technique, private keys are encrypted to create wallet addresses, which can be likened to bank account numbers. In essence, you need your private key to digitally sign transactions. This is essentially like broadcasting to everyone in the network, “I confirm I am sending this amount of X coin to this person.” In contrast, wallet addresses indicate the destination of transactions.  The encryptions are executed in only one direction, which makes it impossible to derive private keys from a person’s wallet addresses.  How does cryptocurrency work?  While the cryptocurrencies themselves act as a medium for exchanging or for storing value, they all rely on a special type of public ledger technology called “blockchain” to record data and to keep track of all of the transactions being sent across the network.  A blockchain is exactly what it sounds like – a virtual chain of blocks each containing a batch of transactions and other data. Once each block is added to the chain, it becomes immutable, meaning the data stored inside it cannot be changed or removed.  Because cryptocurrencies are managed by a network of volunteer contributors known as “nodes” and not by a single intermediary, a system must be in place that ensures everyone participates honestly when recording and adding new data to the blockchain ledger.  The nodes perform a variety of roles on the network, from storing a full archive of all historical transactions to validating new transaction data. By having a distributed group of people all maintaining their own copy of the ledger, blockchain technology has the following advantages over traditional finance where a master copy is maintained by a single institution:  There is no single point of failure: If one node fails it has zero impact on the blockchain ledger.  There is no single source of truth that can be easily corrupted.  The nodes collectively manage the database and confirm new entries are valid transactions.  Think of it as having a cluster of computers take up the roles of a bank by consistently updating the balance sheets of users. In the case of distributed ledgers, however, the balance sheets aren’t stored in a single server. Instead, there are multiple copies of the balance sheets distributed across several computers, with each node, or computer connected to the network, functioning as a separate server. Therefore, even if one of the computers go offline, it wouldn’t be as detrimental as having a single server-based database go offline as can be the case in traditional banking systems.  This infrastructural design makes it possible for cryptocurrencies to evade the security mishaps that often plague fiat. It is difficult to attack or manipulate this system because the attackers must gain control of over 50% of computers connected to the blockchain network. Depending on how big the network is, it can be prohibitively expensive to carry out a coordinated attack. If you compare the amount required to attack established cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and what the attacker stands to gain at the end of the day, pursuing such an endeavor wouldn’t be viable financially.  Also, it is worth mentioning that the distributed nature of these digital assets establishes their censorship-resistant attributes. Unlike the case with banks, which governments regulate, cryptocurrencies have their databases spread across the globe. Therefore, when a government shuts down one of these computers or all the computers within its jurisdiction, the network will continue to function because there are potentially thousands of other nodes in other countries beyond the reach of one government.  So far in this guide, we have explained why cryptocurrencies are secure and why they are censorship-resistant. Now, let us take a look at how crypto transactions are vetted.  How are cryptocurrency transactions validated?  Recall that blockchains are distributed databases where all the transactions executed on a crypto network are recorded permanently. Every block of transactions is linked together chronologically in the order the transactions were validated.  Because it is impossible to set up a central authority or bank to manage blockchains, crypto transactions are validated by nodes (computers connected to a blockchain). So the question is: How do these networks ensure that node operators are willing to partake in the validation process?  The only way to guarantee there will always be individuals willing to invest their time and computers in a blockchain’s validation system is to introduce incentives to do so.  With incentives, validators are encouraged to participate actively and honestly in the validation process to earn rewards in the form of newly minted (created) cryptocurrencies. This incentive system sets the rules that govern the process of picking validators who would, in turn, verify the next batch of transactions. It also ensures that the activities of the validators align with the goal of the network as a whole. Validator nodes found to be involved in actions that undermine the validity of the crypto network can be barred from taking part in subsequent validation processes or punished accordingly. These incentive infrastructures are also known as consensus protocols.  There is a wide range of consensus protocols being used by existing blockchain networks. The two most common ones are:  Proof-of-work (PoW): This incentive system is a computer-intensive consensus protocol that requires validators (known as miners) to compete using expensive equipment in order to generate a winning code that grants them the right to add a new block of transactions to the blockchain. Once they add a new block of transactions to the blockchain, miners receive newly minted cryptocurrencies known as “block rewards” as incentives. Any fees attached to the transactions they include in the new block is also given to the successful miner. Crypto networks that rely on PoW mechanisms include Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Litecoin.  Proof-of-stake (PoS): This is a less energy-intensive alternative to the PoW protocol. Here, node operators don’t need to spend a considerable amount on specialized mining equipment. All they need to do is deposit (or lock away) a particular amount of coins on the blockchain to show their commitment to the well-being of the network. The protocol then picks randomly from the pool of nodes that have staked their funds and assigns them different tasks. For their troubles, the protocol rewards successful validators with newly minted crypto tokens. Crypto networks that use this system include Cardano, Ethereum 2.0 and Polkadot.  What are tokens?  Tokens are digital assets issued by decentralized applications based on blockchains. These are applications similar to the ones you might find on your smartphone, but instead of being operated by a single company, they run completely autonomously. Think of it like a free Uber app where taxi drivers and customers can connect together without having to pay the middleman company a cut of profits.  Because these applications depend on the infrastructure of blockchains, transactions involving tokens come with an added fee settled in the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain in question.  For example, when you send a token – let’s say USDT – on the Ethereum blockchain, you will have to pay a transaction fee denominated in ETH, which is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum ecosystem.  What’s the difference between a cryptocurrency and a digital currency?  Cryptocurrencies are digital assets based on blockchains. They are the vehicles for transferring value on decentralized networks and applications.  Digital currencies are any form of money in digital form, be it cryptocurrencies or central bank-backed virtual money.  How are cryptocurrencies valued?  The value of a cryptocurrency usually depends on the utility of its underlying blockchain – though there have been many instances where social media hype and other superficial factors have played a role in pumping up prices.  The cryptocurrencies of blockchains perceived to have a wide range of utilities are usually more valuable than those that don’t offer much. It all boils down, though, to the demand for the coin relative to its supply and whether the buyer is willing to pay more than the amount the seller initially acquired the coin for.  Notably, cryptocurrencies tend to favor a deflationary system, whereby the number of new coins introduced to the market is predictable and gradually reduces over time.  For many cryptocurrencies, another important element is the total number of coins that can ever exist is often fixed. For instance, there will be only 21 million bitcoins created, of which more than 18 million are already in circulation. This deflationary-based system is the complete opposite of what we have in traditional finance, where governments have the license to print an infinite number of fiat notes and inadvertently devalue their currencies.  Types of cryptocurrencies  Bitcoin was the first of the many cryptocurrencies that exist today. Following its introduction in 2009, developers began to create other variants of cryptocurrencies based on the technology powering the Bitcoin network. In most cases, the cryptocurrencies were designed to improve upon the standards set by Bitcoin. That is why other cryptocurrencies that came after bitcoin are collectively called “altcoins” from the phrase “alternatives to bitcoin.” Prominent examples are:  Ethereum  Litecoin  Cardano  XRP  Polkadot  EOS  Solana  Bitcoin Cash  What is the use case of cryptocurrency?  Initially, cryptocurrency was pushed as an alternative to fiat currency based on the premise that it is portable, censorship-resistant, available globally and an affordable means of executing cross-border transactions. But, other than the digital assets pinned to fiat currencies, the value of cryptocurrencies hasn’t been able to replicate the level of stability needed to function effectively as a medium of exchange.  As a result, most crypto holders have shifted their attention to the investment potential of cryptocurrencies, which has since birthed the speculative side of the crypto market. Investors seem to be more concerned about the possibility that the price of a cryptocurrency may rise sometime in the future than whether they can use cryptocurrencies to purchase goods and services, and so crypto is now predominantly viewed as an investment.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-cryptocurrency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee067fdfdfb0cb1fd56f286b08a934f841697038-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42407265,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVFWaA,1638212136,The Future of Money: A History,"Cryptocurrency is a revolution, but maybe it’s not the revolution you imagined. That’s because more than anything, crypto is a revolution in accounting.  While most people might not think much about accounting, without it we’d still be hunting and gathering instead of blasting satellites into space or communicating instantly on a network that circles the globe. Without accounting, you wouldn’t be reading this article on your iPad, or streaming music on Spotify or renting an Airbnb for your next vacation.  Without accounting, there’s no commerce or trade. Without commerce, there are no planes, no trains, no tractors, no steam engine, no skyscrapers or smartphones. We’d have no nation-states, no boats, no shipping containers traveling all over the world ferrying goods from the far corners of the Earth.  Dan Jeffries is a futurist, systems thinker and author. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.  We’ve only had two accounting revolutions in the entire history of the world before now and both presaged a massive uptick in societal complexity and innovation.  Crypto is the third revolution in accounting. Just like the two that came before, it will mean a huge surge forward in new ideas and technologies that we’re only beginning to understand.  To understand why we just have to turn back the clock to the first two revolutions before racing forward into the future.  The first wave: single-entry accounting  Single-entry accounting goes back to our earliest civilizations. As soon as we could write, we started writing down who owed what to whom.  Hunter-gatherers had no need for accounting – that we know of – because they shared everything communally and their lives were spent in perpetual motion, so property was transient to them.  Read more: The Future of Money: 20 Predictions  We can trace some of the first examples of single-entry accounting to the Sumerians about 5,000 years ago on cuneiform tablets. Those tablets came from Uruk, one of the first great cities of the world. It was a city created by the people who famously gave us the “Epic of Gilgamesh,” the world’s oldest recorded story.  Single-entry accounting is incredibly simple: You just put a note in a ledger. “So-and-so owes $50,” for example.  But single-entry accounting can only take a civilization so far. A city like Uruk was massive by ancient standards, but it was only 5,000 to 6,000 people, not much bigger than a small town today.  The only accountants back then were the king’s brother because you really had to trust that guy. All he had to do was wipe away a single line in the ledger and that money no longer existed. There was no way to verify, no way to audit and no way for two people to agree. The ledger was the only receipt and that made it brittle and prone to error and fraud.  It also made trade an extended family affair. The kings and queens traded with other nobility and mostly they kept all the money for themselves, leaving the rest of us to starve or scratch out a subsistence living. Powerful clans dominated, rising and falling in great waves over time. National borders were endlessly fluid, expanding and collapsing back as one powerful ruler came to power, only to die off or get killed later, his influence collapsing.  Read more: Who Sets the Rules of Bitcoin as Nation-States and Corps Roll In - David Z. Morris  Single-entry accounting was powerful enough to sustain the world into the height of the Roman empire, with the city of Rome reaching 60 million to 70 million people at its peak. While the Romans never developed double-entry bookkeeping, they did have a prototype system that kept track of receipts and expenditures before their civilization started to decline over the next thousand years.  Still, single-entry accounting was almost all the ancient bean counters needed to sustain those early civilizations that dominated the Earth, keeping track of everything from taxes and tithes to tradable goods and services.  But for society to make the next leap, we needed a breakthrough.  The second wave: double-entry accounting  By the 1400s, single-entry systems really started to show their age.  Now we had ships circling the globe, traveling from near and far to bring goods from around the world, everything from salted fish and meat, to wine and beer, to exotic spices and fabrics. Because we could range over huge distances that meant we could trade with people we’d never met before, who weren’t blood relatives or even distant relatives in our tiny clan.  As boats became the most important way to carry goods to distant lands, port city-states like Venice became powerhouses of international trade between east and west, thanks to their proximity to both water and saltworks to preserve everything. But with so much trade going on, single-entry accounting showed deeper and deeper cracks. With single entry, it’s super easy to make data-entry errors. People’s books soon turned into a hopeless mess of conjecture and lost money. The more trades that are stacked up, the more errors.  Multiple civilizations, from the Italians in the 1300s, to the ancient Koreans, to the Second Muslim Caliphate all developed versions of a double-entry system but the systems never fully caught on. It took another radical invention to solidify the rise of double-entry: the printing press.  While money and accounting make the world go round, the printing press was the most important invention in the history of the world. Without it, knowledge would have remained siloed or lost. People would develop a breakthrough in one area, only to die off and leave no trace of it, forcing others who came later to discover it again. The printing press let people record the world’s most important knowledge and then make hundreds or thousands of copies of it, meaning it could be distributed more widely and enlighten more minds. Now ideas survived and circulated, instead of dying with their creators.  By the 1400s, a Franciscan friar, Luca Bartolomeo de Pacioli, finally codified the double-entry system, and the printing press assured its wide distribution. It swiftly became the standard for Venetian merchants, all thanks to the preserving power of print and their need to trade with foreign lands.  It’s no coincidence that world trade surged after that. Goods and services could flow easily around the world, and it wasn’t long before world trade grew faster and faster. Now people could easily do business with people they didn’t know and keep records of it.  Fast forward to today and we still use a double-entry system. If you do your taxes in TurboTax or keep your books in Quickbooks, you’re using double entry. Double entry keeps track of both credits and debits. It ensures that each side in the transaction has a receipt that proves what happened, and they don’t have to rely on the other’s record completely. This let the ancient traders of the world do business with people they didn’t know.  Read more: It’s 2031. This Is the World That Crypto Created - Dan Jeffries  But just as single entry once started to show its cracks in the ancient world, double entry is starting to show its cracks in the modern world.  Take a company like Enron. They did all kinds of things to cook the books, even conspiring with an outside auditor to make it look more legitimate. They managed to hide billions in debt and defraud investors for years before their crimes finally came crashing down around them.  That’s where triple-entry accounting comes in.  The third wave: triple-entry accounting  Bitcoin was the world’s first working example of triple-entry accounting.  Instead of just two entries, a debit and a credit, it uses a global, cryptographically secured ledger with a third entry that tracks all the money and where it lives at any single point in time. As the money moves, the ledger gets updated as the final system of account.  A blockchain is really a way for us all to agree on objective reality. A transaction closes at a specific time. For instance, this is where the money was on this day at 6:13 AM, and days later it was arranged this way.  We’ve seen theoretical ideas of triple entry, first from Yuri Ijiri, an economics professor, who proposed a novel momentum accounting system with a third entry in 1989, and then later from Ian Grigg in 2005, who proposed a triple-entry system that uses the third entry to track state. Grigg’s system fits more closely with how cryptographic ledgers work today, and it’s likely Satoshi read that proposal when working on the original Bitcoin code.  Bitcoin was the first example that worked in the real world instead of just on paper. The code proved it was more than just a theory or a novel idea. It could power an international monetary system with no centralized authority to run it. It has spawned thousands of other coins that build on its ideas and still we’re just at the beginning of the triple-entry revolution.  The world of tomorrow  Triple-entry accounting will smash the old financial system and give rise to a new one built on dynamic money that flows around the world with incredible ease.  We’re in the earliest possible stages of that revolution now. We’ve exploded past simple currency, and we’re already seeing the first radical innovations to spawn from the original idea of a triple-entry ledger, like NFTs, which will accelerate the $370 billion collectibles market, or decentralized finance (DeFi), which will change the way we do finance.  But we still have so much further to go, and here’s how I see it happening:  Cash will die, replaced by central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Over the next hundred years, algorithms will start to replace old men in suits making monetary policy. AI agents will monitor economic factors in real-time, and U.S. Federal Reserve policy will be nothing but a series of intelligent algorithms automatically expanding or contracting the money supply, setting rates and distributing e-dollars.  Increasingly nation-state money will transform, replaced by international money, as multinational e-currency radiates outwards and expands to new countries. As more nations forgo their own digital money in favor of CBDCs initially created by China, the U.S. and the EU, increasingly those money supplies will become an island of their own, with their own boards and governors that transcend the individual countries. The money supply will start to shift with the policies of a broader and broader coalition of countries, shaping everything from politics to economic policy. Each country will have a stake, with nation-state validator supernodes in a proof-of-stake-like consensus system where they’ll vote on change rather than make changes unilaterally.  Central bankers will watch economic statistics flowing in real-time on massive dashboards. Increasingly powerful AIs will make micro-adjustments to policy as they pull in a torrent of data: satellites watching ships surge around the world with machine learning object recognition giving them near-perfect trade statistics; trillions of RFID tagged items will track themselves on shipping containers; autonomous trucks will report up to the minute fuel and delivery time as they race across specially designed highways at speeds too fast for human drivers; the minutest fluctuations in consumer spending in small towns and big cities will change lending rates and give us a minimum wage that adjusts seasonally instead of every few decades.  Taxes won’t get filed once a year; they’ll get pulled out of people’s accounts constantly, with a smart contract-driven system that knows what you owe. When you have a problem, you’ll need to call a clearing center to get your refund. But you won’t wait until the end of the year: You’ll get it as soon as you manage to get off hold and get to an operator, who blips it back to you instantly.  A parallel economic operating system will surge out of today’s crypto, with privacy-driven, decentralized economies springing out of apps and individual creators. People won’t fully trust the gated, highly surveilled nation-station spawned money; they’ll need an alternative, which focuses on privacy. Everyone will have CBDCs but they’ll have decentralized money too and switching between it will be as easy as a finger swipe. Tomorrow’s children won’t own a credit card, and they won’t even know what it is. They will zap money across an encrypted messenger or snap a picture of a QR code on their smart glasses and smart contacts.  Entire families will have a shard of a key to a trust or the whole family’s pool of money. Think of it as a personalized family bank. Mom will set rules on how much Junior can spend with a simple dashboard as he heads out with his friends to the mall.  When a father or mother passes away, the rules of the trust will trigger a third-party oracle to check and the contract will automatically disperse the money at pre-timed intervals, no lawyer, probate or holding company required.  Millions of people will pool their money into decentralized lending pools, getting dividends and payouts that make current bank interest look paltry by comparison. When tomorrow’s people need a loan for school, or building a house, or starting a business, they’ll go to the lending software and borrow from those millions of people instead of a bank.  People will walk into a cafe and love the food so much that they want to invest in the cafe. No longer will shares in business be restricted to giant companies, everything will be sliced up into shares from the tiniest mom and pop shop to everyday items like bikes and video game consoles. Investors will pull up a private, small business shares platform and research the cafe’s sales after agreeing to a privacy contract for prospective investors. The data in the ledger will decrypt, and they’ll study the anonymized sales over 10 years, all without ever having to have direct access to the company’s books.  Kids will run into a convenience store and just grab everything and walk out as if they’re stealing. But they won’t have stolen a thing. The AI vision system will track everything they snatched and send the charge right to their smart wallet. They’ll have authorized charges to the store via a key exchange, and the smart contract will have the right to take out anything less than 200 e-USD and prompt for authorization above that amount.  A week later maybe you were in the store, and the store got hacked. Hackers tried to charge an extra 200 e-USD to you to get past the contract limit, but your little AI watcher agent caught it and stopped the fraud from happening. You never had to call a fraud department and beg for your money back.  From the wildly futuristic to the everyday mundane  All of this may seem far out and crazy, but the seeds of all of it are here right now. How could something as simple as a new accounting system drive all that sci-fi level technology and societal change?  But that’s the nature of technological change. It’s slow and then suddenly fast and furious, rocketing up an exponential curve.  A simple historical parallel is the film industry. When Steven Spielberg made the original “Jurassic Park” with the first breakout CGI effects and digital film editing in 1993, he said, “This is the way all films will be made.” As Alexander Huls wrote in the Atlantic, “George Lucas, who was also there, recalled ‘it was like one of those moments in history, like the invention of the light bulb or the first telephone call ... A major gap had been crossed and things were never going to be the same.’”  Yet it seemed crazy to most people. Many filmmakers resisted. They didn’t think CGI could match analog effects or that digital editing could ever be as fast and fluid as physical editing. But they were wrong. Now we don’t call it “digital filmmaking.” We just call it “filmmaking.” It’s incredibly rare for anyone to use physical film anymore, not to mention scissors to cut it apart and paste it back together. We do it all on robust digital dashboards.  And just as digital dinosaurs replaced animatronics, so will the digital ledgers of tomorrow replace the dinosaur money and policies of today. Digital ledgers, cryptographic systems and triple-entry accounting won’t be novel or new. They’ll just be the way things are done.  The perfect storm of digitization, AI agents, cryptography and triple-entry accounting will create a real-time world, one where peer-to-peer lending is possible at scale and where NFTs go from novelty to real legal ownership contracts. Tomorrow is a place where decentralized identities connect you to everything from your work to your national voting system, and algorithms adjust how much money is in circulation based on real-time economic statistics. GDP won’t have a lag of months, it will get tracked in real-time as ships surge over the oceans because we’ll know exactly how many containers sit in their cargo holds. When you buy a bike, it will have a smart contract that transfers ownership and if someone steals it, it will be a lot harder to flip because a buyer can check who really owns it against the third entry in the ledger.  The revolution that bitcoin unleashed on the world is about so much more than money.

42407264,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVFWTY,1638210155,Who Sets the Rules of Bitcoin as Nation-States and Corps Roll In,"“Little by little, and then all at once.”  That’s how people go bankrupt, of course. But it’s also a fair description of bitcoin’s ascendance from radical experiment to widely used technology. Recall, if you dare, that in March 2020 BTC was trading at about $5,000 per token and had been in the doldrums for years. Then COVID-19 lockdowns juiced boredom-driven day trading and increased interest in crypto, ultimately unleashing a string of transformational moments for Bitcoin. Those included the big BTC buy by Tesla, integration into Twitter, high-profile legislative debates in the U.S., a record-setting stadium name deal and national adoption in El Salvador.  This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.  The arrival of nation-states and tech corporations in Bitcoinland is a huge, positive milestone. Twitter and El Salvador are directly exposing new mass audiences to crypto usage instead of just speculation. Because bitcoin is more useful as more people use it (the “network effect”), these moves also increase the appeal of future integrations. Major corporate buys, meanwhile, open the door for more institutional investment and legitimize bitcoin’s inflation-hedge thesis.  But those new players also bring new risks – arguably risks of a sort the world has never before seen. An array of centrally run, sometimes very powerful entities now have vested interests in the design and growth of a system they all share. History suggests their interests will, sooner or later, diverge, and that some will try and change bitcoin to their liking.  They will find the system used to propose and execute changes to bitcoin is barely a “system” at all. Unlike a company or a national government, the Bitcoin blockchain doesn’t have a formal leadership structure (with one debatable exception). Instead, as developer Gavin Andresen put it in 2015, Bitcoin’s design and evolution “really comes down to, what code are people running, and how influential are the people who are running the code?” In other words, Bitcoin upgrades are largely a matter of persuasion.  So what if Twitter or Tesla or Germany decide that they want Bitcoin to be something else? With enough money, with courtrooms and jails, with an army division or two, could they force their vision on the most powerful stateless entity on the planet?  Why change Bitcoin?  We got a preview of such a conflict in the so-called “Blocksize War” of 2015-2017, recently chronicled in an excellent book by Jonathan Bier. In very broad strokes, the conflict was between entities, including companies like BitPay and Coinbase, that advocated for larger “blocks” of transactions to increase the network’s speed. They were opposed by “small blockers,” who warned that increasing the block size would make it more expensive and difficult to run a Bitcoin node, threatening the system’s decentralization and, ultimately, its resilience.  The Blocksize War is an important episode when considering the future of Bitcoin, because it illustrates both the motives and methods that we might see replayed on a still larger scale. In this case, the motives for big blockers were largely commercial. Businesses like BitPay needed more throughput to turn bitcoin into a coffee-cup currency. The other side of the debate, at least in Bier’s telling, was made up of people prioritizing long-term stability and what we’d now call the “store of value” model, even if it meant bitcoin transactions stayed fairly slow.  As bitcoin becomes a more important component of the world’s financial infrastructure, it’s not hard to think of other motives for changing the way it works. Perhaps a surveillance-obsessed Western government will push for a change that threatens pseudonymity. Miners might aim to increase their fees as block rewards decline. A coalition of authoritarian regimes might seek to add native geofencing. Or, if you want to get really crazy, imagine a populist uprising circa 2050 agitating to remove Bitcoin’s 21 million coin-supply cap.  Some of these scenarios are more realistic than others. But their mere possibility is probably news to many bitcoin holders and users.  “It’s safe to assume that 95% of people have no clue how [Bitcoin] upgrades work,” says Jackson Wood, a financial adviser who works with crypto. “They’re 100% taking it for granted that it just exists and will always be the way it is. But if consensus rules on Bitcoin, literally anything can change.”  The tangled layers of Bitcoin governance  Various kinds of decision-making mechanisms hold sway over different aspects of bitcoin.  On a day-to-day basis, the combination of proof-of-work mining and blockchain database sequencing determines which transactions are valid and which aren’t. There are at least two well-known forms of technical attack that could interfere with these “on-chain” rules, but they have limited potential. Though it’s financially impractical at this point, an entity willing to spend many millions of dollars to rent bitcoin mining rigs could theoretically conduct a 51% attack on bitcoin, giving them the ability to manipulate a small subset of transactions.  The other purely technical attack would be a “hard fork,” or software change, in which an alternate version of Bitcoin is released and promoted to miners. But previous Bitcoin forks show how difficult it is to gain adoption for a divergent Bitcoin: Dozens if not hundreds have faded into obscurity. Even a relatively successful fork like Bitcoin Cash, which emerged from the Blocksize War with a large, built-in constituency, has fallen far behind Bitcoin.  “Governance” of a blockchain system, though, more often refers to how these consensus rules themselves can be changed. Very broadly, Bitcoin takes its fundamental development and administrative structure from the open-source model through which unaffiliated developers collaborate on software like Linux. Bitcoin’s source code lives on Github just like that of many other open-source projects. Literally anyone can debate Bitcoin’s future, and even propose specific changes – though actually getting traction for your proposal is a much bigger challenge.  The most direct approach for an entity hoping to reshape Bitcoin, then, would be “putting in pull requests on Github and suggesting code changes that go in that direction,” says Pierre Rochard, a longtime Bitcoiner on the product team at Kraken.  But in practice, if the changes went against broader community sentiment, this would be basically impossible.  Read more: The Future of Money: 20 Predictions  “What they would run into is that Core has a tremendous amount of peer review,” says Rochard. “Even small changes require two or three reviewers who have experience and somewhat of a reputation to get merged [into the reference client]. And then big changes that would affect consensus rules, those receive just a tremendous amount of scrutiny – both from developers and from interested laypeople. And it’s not based on votes, it’s somewhat based on reputation.”  In practice, this nebulous, reputation-based approach boils down to a web of protracted debates at conferences and online, across message boards like r/bitcoin, Telegram and Twitter. This swarm approach means changes are slow. “It took forever to get [recent Bitcoin upgrade] Taproot approved,” observes Wood. “It was months and months and years of debate.”  In an abstract sense, you can compare that interminable and open-access debate to the “proof of work” in Bitcoin’s on-chain transaction rules. Just as a block of transactions can’t be approved on-chain if a miner hasn’t taken an economic risk in certifying it, a Bitcoin upgrade that arrives without a paper trail of months and months of rhetorical free-for-all would be instantly flagged as suspicious.  Rochard believes that this crowdsourced scrutiny will grow along with the rising stakes of Bitcoin design. “Even though we’re at a different scale than 2017, I see Bitcoin’s governance pattern as a bit of a fractal. Even as the scale increases, we’ll see the same patterns play out.”  Bitcoin also has one key difference from Linux or Open Office that makes any non-consensus change difficult: Bitcoin does not have an automated upgrade system, or even an automated notification of an available upgrade. Miners instead have to manually install new versions of the client.  So even if someone successfully meddled with the Core Github, they would have to publicize the new version to get nodes to upgrade – at which point the non-consensus change would be exposed. It would then, most likely, be reversed, thanks to one of the last lines of defense against malicious Bitcoin code: a rollback.  Read more: The World Bitcoin Will Build – Cory Klippsten  “Even if the consensus is wrong, if all the core developers start acting crazy – there’s nothing saying a group of people couldn’t jump up and say, ‘Let’s go back to how it was before,’” says Wood. It wouldn’t necessarily be an easy or smooth process, but in the face of an existential threat to Bitcoin, such a rollback would be an invaluable lifeline.  Just Core things  Not everything in Bitcoin is so decentralized, though. Only a handful of individuals scattered around the world have what’s known as “commit access,” or the ability to merge proposed changes into the Bitcoin Core reference implementation. This group of maintainers was created by Gavin Andresen, who was essentially handed the reins to Bitcoin when pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto stepped away in 2011. As described by Andresen in 2015, he picked two trusted collaborators and, with them, picked two more. Other maintainers have since left or been added, largely based on demonstrated commitment and contributions to the project.  This group has sometimes been regarded with suspicion because of its perceived power. But the job is far less glamorous or influential than it appears.  “In Bitcoin, maintainers are very much janitors,” says Rochard, tasked, for instance, with removing spam from the repository. “They understand the backlash that would happen if they were to make a decision, so they’re very loath to do that. They only merge things when there’s a rough consensus among frequent contributors, rather than themselves making a controversial call.”  This was cemented as far back as 2014 with the handover of the lead maintenance role from Andresen to Wladimir Van Der Laan. Andresen has said that he was more willing to be something of a benevolent dictator in the early days of Bitcoin, but Van Der Laan explicitly renounced any actual decision-making power. Van Der Laan himself stepped back from responsibilities earlier this year, and signaled that he wanted even more decentralization of the maintenance role.  The upshot is that even if a powerful organization used bribery, blackmail, or other means to subvert one or more maintainers with commit access, they would make little headway in actually changing Bitcoin without the backing of broader consensus.  “There would be alarm bells,” says Rochard. “How did this get merged in?” Rochard says there has been at least one instance of a maintainer accidentally merging code that hadn’t been vetted. It was swiftly caught and undone.  Governance into the future  The strange, emergent, arguably chaotic status quo of Bitcoin’s decentralized governance appears, for now, to make it highly resistant to hostile takeover. Amazingly, governments and other potential meddlers seem to have gotten the message.  “If you had some sort of Washington-corporate alliance that wanted to make Bitcoin a transparent chain, guess what? They would have fought Taproot,” says Alex Gladstein at the Human Rights Foundation, who advocates for Bitcoin as a tool against authoritarian governments. “But there was no organized resistance to Taproot. We’re just not seeing it, which is good.”  But not everyone is sure that the open-source scrum will be enough to keep things running smoothly forever.  “As much as we say this is decentralized, there are humans behind it,” says Merav Ozair, a blockchain-focused finance professor at Rutgers. “Someone has to write the software. It shouldn’t be at the hand of one developer, or a small group. We should have a long-term, bigger audit.”  To that end, the nonprofit International Association of Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA), where Ozair is an adviser, is developing a proposal for a European Union committee to monitor Bitcoin code and interface with governments. Such a committee would have no formal role in Bitcoin governance, but, over time, could build up legitimacy and community influence.  Ultimately, that sort of transparent bid for influence seems to be the only plausible way to “attack” Bitcoin: joining in the debate about its design, and building up a reputation for sound thinking. You might say that the best way to successfully infiltrate Bitcoin governance – maybe the only way – is to actually do the work of making the system better.

As part of the fund launch, Hivemind has selected layer 1 blockchain Algorand as a strategic partner to provide technology and network ecosystem infrastructure.  New York-based Hivemind plans to use the venture fund to invest in crypto companies and trade digital assets. It will include a dedicated play-to-earn gaming-focused arm headed by former Goldman Sachs analyst Sam Peurifoy, also known by his gaming handle “Das Kapitalist.” Other investment areas of interest include crypto infrastructure, blockchain protocols, open internet, programmable money and virtual worlds.  Zhang previously spent 14 years at Citi, where he most recently was co-head of the structured products trading and solutions division.  “We believe blockchain technology is a paradigm shift, and we are still in the early innings. Our mission is to provide start-to-finish capital and infrastructure solutions to visionary entrepreneurs and category-defining crypto projects,” Zhang said in the press release.  Regarding the hiring of Peurifoy, Zhang said that “Sam brings a unique combination of deep knowledge of the play-to-earn space, close relationship with the community and a real passion for gaming and the metaverse. With Algorand as our first strategic partner, we have a very exciting roadmap on our play-to-earn strategy right out of the gate, and beyond. I think we will do some amazing things together,” Zhang told CoinDesk in an email.  “The launch of Hivemind’s venture represents an exciting new milestone in serious players entering the Algorand and broader blockchain ecosystem. Hivemind will change the way organizations are using blockchain to transform businesses,” Algorand COO W. Sean Ford said in a statement.  Zhang told CoinDesk the fund’s near-term plans will center around hiring. “We are meticulously focused on hiring and growing the team that will bring a decentralized world to reality,” Zhang said.  Crypto funds have raised increasingly huge funds this year as digital asset prices have rallied.

It governs what we do at Swan Bitcoin and how we invest via Bitcoiner Ventures. This is NOT some sort of hyperbitcoinization fantasy scenario that I’ve dreamed up, but rather a thesis for what I see as the most likely outcome based on my understanding of economics, history, geopolitics and technology.  Cory Klippsten is CEO of Swan Bitcoin. This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.  The year is 2035. Bitcoin has become the most widely adopted store of value in the world and is now trading at $10 million to $20 million per bitcoin. It’s accepted for goods and services throughout the world. Items in stores are priced in satoshis alongside dollars. The dollar is still in common use, but any meaningful amount of wealth is now stored in Bitcoin due to its superiority in preserving that wealth across time.  The decisions to focus on security and decentralization early in Bitcoin’s development proved to be correct. Despite more than $250 billion of venture funding, Bitcoin’s centralized imitators succumbed to hacks, fraud and human failings. Most cannibalized each other as one replaced another over and over again. When the dust settled, bitcoin emerged from the Great Crypto Bubble as the native money of the digital age. Names like Cardano, Solana and Ethereum are mostly forgotten, only popping up occasionally as cautionary reminders of a speculative mania gone wrong.  All useful innovation that occurred on other cryptos was deployed in layers on top of Bitcoin’s secure and decentralized settlement layer. In the end, Bitcoin proved to be sufficient for all use cases. Its scarcity, monetary policy and decentralization were the only traits that mattered to savers to store their wealth in it. In just a few short years, the benefits of adopting sound money backed by energy began to permeate throughout society, driving the world into a period of unprecedented growth and prosperity.  The entire world’s financial architecture runs on the most secure network in the world. Gone are inflation, high fees and limited accessibility. Bitcoin now underlies a majority of economic activity. Bitcoin fundamentally changed the way humans organize, serving as the Schelling point humanity accepted was better than centralized alternatives. Bitcoin serves as a neutral money that makes it more profitable for nations to coexist in peace rather than to go to war. This results in improved relations between nations and promotes global trade.  Read more from the Future of Money week.  The Future of Money: 20 Predictions: Jeff Wilser & Helene Braun  Introducing Future of Money Week: CoinDesk  Cultures begin to blend and borders hold less meaning. Individuals have more freedom than ever before. They choose to live wherever they please due to technological advancements along with the ability to take self custody of their wealth. Nations compete for sovereign individuals by bettering themselves to attract these digital nomads’ wealth and ingenuity. Bitcoin promotes political civility and a more peaceful world.  Bitcoin mining has revolutionized the way we interact with our energy resources and the electrical grid. For the first time in history, we have a way to monetize energy that is not location dependent. Wasted and stranded energy resources are now made productive. Producers become more profitable and can invest in long-term projects that bring about reliable, safe and abundant energy resources, like nuclear reactors.  Energy prices fall every year across the world as energy producers harness energy from cheap resources that were previously unfeasible. The electrical grid is stabilized with bitcoin miners that can respond to variable load demand with the flip of a switch. Gone are rolling blackouts and grid failures. More humans are able to interact with energy than ever before, lifting nearly all humans out of poverty in the process.  The year is 2050. Global gross domestic product (GDP) growth has exploded to levels not seen since the 1950s, and that is reflected in growing purchasing power for the middle class, which itself is growing rapidly as billions around the world join its ranks. No longer is success determined by how close to the money printer an individual is, but rather by how much real value they create in the world.  Money appreciates in value over time so that individuals can plan their future knowing their wealth will be protected. This leads to market participants’ time horizons lengthening, creating more investment, more entrepreneurship, more productivity and increased living standards.  This boom in entrepreneurship is what ultimately drives humanity forward. As more and more people continue to transact in bitcoin, it becomes more liquid, and its price signal allows market participants to coordinate with one another in the production of goods and services. That results in further division of labor, increases specialization and gives rise to highly efficient economic systems.  The ability to reliably save means people no longer need to speculate to beat inflation because inflation is gone. There is no need to stare at charts or listen to financial advice on how to speculate on risk assets just to keep up. Individuals can save their money and their time to pursue their interests and passions instead.  See also: The Future of Bitcoin: 12 Scenarios From Bullish to Bearish  The arts and sciences flourish and a new renaissance begins. Individuals spend their free time thinking about how to solve big problems to provide lasting benefit for the world. Long-term projects are funded as people invest in the future they know is achievable. Freed from the rat race of consumption culture, a new generation of creators spend years developing their craft and produce works that last through the ages. This change in mindset leads to feats of invention and creativity unfathomable to people from the pre-Bitcoin era.  That is the most likely future I see for us. Another, more ominous future is still very much a possibility. A future dominated by surveillance states, central bank digital currencies, social credit scores, authoritarianism, conflict and chaos. But we have Bitcoin, and thus we have both hope and a plan. That’s why we’re building for Bitcoin. That’s why we’re building for bitcoiners. No one is going to make our Bright Orange Future for us.

Mining stocks have tumbled in recent weeks after a rally in October, and are logging a strong start to November. The recent drop corresponds with price declines in bitcoin and ether, suggesting that many investors still view mining firms as a public-market proxy for investing in leading cryptocurrencies.  “Although the slightly more risk-off market and BTC pullback may have contributed, we also think the group moved a little too much too fast,” Brendler said, adding that fundamentals for the miners “remain fantastic.”  Bitcoin’s price fell to near $53,000 last week, after reaching as high as $68,000 earlier this month. Shares of Marathon Digital, one of the largest bitcoin miners, also followed the same trend this month. Bitcoin has recovered since then and was trading near $57,000 as of press time.  Brendler highlighted Core Scientific, which is planning to go public via a special purpose acquisition company, as his favorite “buy-and-hold” miner and also sees potential upside in the shares of Hut 8 and Argo Blockchain.

42421204,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgrZF,1638204314,A National Stock Exchange That Supports NFTs? Welcome to Switzerland,"Imagine if the London Stock Exchange or Euroclear said they were going to include non-fungible tokens (NFTs) among the assets they trade and settle.  That’s just one of the things Switzerland’s now-up-and-running crypto trading venue SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) is contemplating, after a seemingly interminable wait for licenses from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).  The convergence between the new cryptocurrency world and traditional finance is illustrated in SDX, whose parent company is SIX Group, the operator of the Swiss national stock exchange.  The floodgates are now open, according to SDX Chairman Thomas Zeeb. And it seems a segue into NFTs is a natural progression for SDX, whose plan was always to tokenize non-traditional assets like real estate and art, in addition to existing financial products.  “Expect to see an acceleration of some of the pent-up stuff we’ve been keeping a lid on for a while,” Zeeb said in an interview with CoinDesk. “I see absolutely no reason why SDX wouldn’t be a desirable infrastructure for NFTs.”  SDX eyes global liquidity  In the short term, there’s a pipeline of tokenization products that can be launched relatively quickly, Zeeb said, including some new listings in equities that could be targeted at digital-savvy investors looking to benefit from the liquidity and price discovery associated with assets being on a full exchange.  “We’ve got a lot of private market stuff that wouldn’t have the liquidity,” Zeeb said. “So, it’s promissory notes; it’s art funds, that, as you would expect at the moment, has the whole NFT piece as well.”  Read more: Switzerland’s Six Digital Exchange Launches With Blockchain Bond  It’s a digital asset blueprint with global aspirations.  In December 2020, SDX announced a partnership with Japan’s banking and financial services giant SBI Group to replicate a Swiss-based crypto exchange and central securities depository (CSD) in Singapore. The SBI joint venture, which Zeeb refers to as the Asia Digital Exchange or ADX, is designed to create a regulated, global liquidity pool between Asia and Europe.  “That opens up a lot of opportunities, whether the issuer is in Asia and does it through ADX, or the issuer is in Europe and does it through us,” Zeeb said. “Perhaps at some point, there’ll be a link to the United States. Then you really have a global liquidity pool where it doesn’t matter where you access that network. As an investor, you’re getting the benefit of liquidity, price finding, spreads and volumes across that global pool. And that starts to look quite interesting for the future.”  The SDX/SBI joint venture is set to go live in 2022, subject to regulatory approvals from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  CBDCs and stablecoins  Another area where SDX had been waiting patiently to break new ground is through its work with the Swiss National Bank on a wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC), a kind of ultimate blockchain-based settlement token.  SDX’s work on CBDCs, which includes the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), has also been exported into the digital asset sandbox overseen by the Bank of France to connect with a euro-denominated CBDC settlement token.  “There will be some stuff coming out shortly on where we stand with that,” Zeeb said. “It’s an interesting development given that BIS is involved, and obviously there are links to what they’re doing in Singapore, as well as driving forward the stuff in Europe, both with the Banque de France and with ourselves.”  Meanwhile, an SDX Swiss franc stablecoin serves as a “transitional stage to CBDC,” Zeeb said. The agreement SDX has with the Swiss National Bank (SNB) is that the exchange would block Swiss francs on an account at the central bank and issue the stablecoin.  “It’s not creating money supply, so the central bank was comfortable with that while they went through their analyses around CBDC,” Zeeb said. “I suspect we will either find other applications for the stablecoin and/or move straight to CBDC, as soon as the SNB is ready to pull the trigger on it.”  Read more: Swiss Central Bank Ready to Run With wCBDC in January: ‘Just Takes a Policy Decision’  While Zeeb wishes things could move forward a little quicker, he accepts Swiss time is relatively fast in comparison with other countries’ crypto road maps.  “Probably not many Swiss people would agree with this,” Zeeb said, “but we have the benefit of having a fairly enlightened government that said pretty early on, ‘We need to have a digital strategy.’ And it’s a small country. So, you can define the requirements and then let the commercial guys run with it.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/29/a-national-stock-exchange-that-supports-nfts-welcome-to-switzerland,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e679a1b81e2341bcf8f0e6bd27fd19072c9656f6-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In addition, board member Bret Taylor has been named independent chair of the board.  Dorsey shared an internal email confirming his resignation, in which he described the importance of Twitter “breaking away from its founding and founders.”  He has yet to announce what his next move will be, though he indicated in August that he had plans to build a decentralized bitcoin exchange via a division of payments company Square, of which he is also CEO. Square recently released a white paper with more details about the plans.

42417097,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS4SOz,1638200542,The Future of Money: 20 Predictions,"Will bitcoin kill the U.S. dollar? Will money become tokenized? How do we use cash?  Since we don’t have a crystal ball, we reached out to some of the brightest minds in crypto to share their predictions on “the future of money.” It’s a dead-simple question. The prompt was open-ended, allowing them to interpret the question in any way they see fit … and the results are fascinating.  Contradictions abound. Some are hopeful, some are sinister, some are bullish on crypto, some are skeptical and some envision a world very different from today.  Just a hint of the possible futures: Balaji Srinivasan foresees a “DeFi matrix” that will ultimately be “a check on the power of central bank currencies.”  This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.  Others see a world that is fully tokenized, or as Arca’s Jeff Dorman predicts, “every company in the world will have a token in its capital structure.” Bitcoin maximalist Erik Voorhees suspects that fiat currencies will “self-immolate.” And, in perhaps a chilling vision, central banker Marcelo Prates imagines a future currency “issued by a group of six big tech firms known as the ‘six sisters,’ and this currency gobbles up the world.”  There’s only one thread that cuts through all 20 predictions: Whatever the future of money holds, it won’t be boring.  1. Stablecoins replace ‘dollarization’  In the old days, countries whose currencies collapsed would dollarize – they’d import dollar bills and start using that as money. Ten years from now, that will be a relic. Countries will dollarize using permissionless stablecoins, and central banks around the world will ultimately fear crypto-dollarization as a check against runaway inflation.  -Haseeb Qureshi – managing partner, Dragonfly Capital  2. Crypto and fiat will coexist  Crypto and the top fiat currencies continue to coexist. We might see a consolidation in smaller national currencies as people find it easier to access USD via public blockchains.  -Hasu – research collaborator, Paradigm  3. Everyone becomes a programmer  Digital objects are becoming as commonplace as emails, and programming literacy is akin to reading literacy. I expect in the coming years people will be creating hundreds of tokens a year, all of which will have price discovery, be tradable and have multiple financial attributes.  Similarly, being able to write, read and interact with smart contracts that make this possible will be a skill that increasingly more people have to participate in the economy. This means that money will become less abstract – some number in some box – and far more tied to our digital labor and self-expression.  -Lex Sokolin – head economist and co-head of DeFi/fintech, Consensys  4. The world adopts the ‘DeFi matrix’  The DeFi matrix may be to the 2020s what the social graph was to the 2010s. Once every asset can be represented in a digital wallet – bitcoin and ethereum, yes, but also CBDCs [central bank digital currencies], stocks, loans, bonds, etc. – all these billions of assets will trade against each other every second of every day around the world.  This table of pairwise trades is what I call the DeFi matrix. Some of the cells in the DeFi matrix, like BTC/USD, have tremendous liquidity across many order books. Others, like a recent NFT [non-fungible token] vs. a new token, may only have what an AMM [Automated Market Maker] can give them. But all financial markets can be reduced to sub-matrices of the DeFi matrix. The traditional stock market will be CBDCs vs crypto equities. The forex market will be CBDCs vs CBDCs. And the fiat/crypto markets will be BTC/USDC and the like.  -Balaji Srinivasan – investor, former chief technology officer of Coinbase and general partner at a16z  Srinivasan then elaborates on the implication of the DeFi matrix, which leads to our next prediction:  5. The DeFi matrix spurs competition and becomes a check on central banks  The DeFi matrix will be a check on the power of central bank digital currencies. Just as Google News made every local newspaper compete against every local newspaper, digital wallets will make every national digital currency compete against every other national digital currency – and every other asset, public and private.  Nations will only be able to mandate adoption within their borders, and even then people may only retain the minimum balance of a surveillance currency. They’ll use digital wallets to select assets with programmability, privacy, possibility of upside and predictable monetary policy over locked-down assets that promise none of these features. As such, we are entering an age of global monetary competition.  -Balaji Srinivasan  6. Fiat crumbles  “Within a decade, fiat currencies will be in severe decline, brought on by their own self-immolation, and hastened by the existence of sound, market-based alternatives.”  -Erik Voorhees, founder of ShapeShift  7. Cash survives  It’s fashionable for futurists to predict the demise of physical cash, but digital infrastructures are insecure in a world in which climate change is bringing ever more extreme weather events. The fact that “cash doesn’t crash” means that it is far more resilient than digital money, and it will be around for a long time into the future. Digital is massively overrated.  -Brett Scott, author of “The Heretic’s Guide to Global Finance: Hacking the Future of Money.”  And in a bit of contrarian spice, Scott also offers the next two…  8. Crypto fails to challenge the monetary system  Crypto tokens like bitcoin do not fundamentally challenge the monetary system, given that they depend on the monetary system to give them a price, but that price does enables them to be counter-traded (the process of swapping one thing for another via their monetary price). There is a new age of countertrade emerging, but crypto enthusiasts keep mistaking it for a new age of money.  -Brett Scott  9. ‘New-wave IOUs’ take off  New-wave IOU and rippling credit systems begin to take off. The crypto mainstream has perpetuated some pretty regressive ideas about money for the last 10 years by fixating on a commodity paradigm, but by far the most interesting new experiments in money involve finding new ways to create horizontal networks of promissory IOUs between people.  -Brett Scott  10. ‘The future of money is bitcoin’  -Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer, Human Rights Foundation  11. Everything becomes tokenized  The “tokenization of everything” is rapidly changing how we perceive money and wealth, spurring the creation of digital micro-economies. NFTs are the first killer app. The battle for the future of money is on, and my money is on Web 3.0 innovations, creating opportunities for many, not just a few.  -Sandra Ro, CEO, Global Blockchain Business Council  12. Programmable money puts the planet’s resources to work  Money is just a representation of the world’s assets – our energy and our vision. The future of money is the future of how we put this planet’s immense resources to work. Putting money on the blockchain, making it programmable and enabling it to work with other services and assets are the keys to giving us choice and power to put our money to work.  Whether it’s investing in solar farms or paying for education, there are still so many great projects that are not being done for lack of investment. With programmable blockchain-based money, we can take our own assets and put them to work for everyone’s benefit.  -Paul Brody, global blockchain leader at Ernst & Young  13. Companies ape into tokens  I believe every company in the world will have a token in its capital structure in the next five to 10 years. These tokens will be hybrid securities – part loyalty/member rewards program and part quasi-equity, in that the token will have a utility within a company’s ecosystem (rewards) and will also have financial value as the company grows revenues (pass-through dividends).  All consumer-facing businesses will benefit from engaging their customers with a token – from Starbucks, Delta Airlines, Netflix, and Disney to small local companies like your barber, gym and corner bodega.  -Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca  14. Big Tech reigns supreme  It’s 2031 and over 6 billion people use BTAs in their daily transactions, a digital currency issued by a group of six big tech firms known as the “six sisters.”  BTAs are unbacked and circulate globally on a network developed in 2024 by the then three most powerful central banks. With the massive adoption of BTAs, only 21 of the almost 200 sovereign currencies that existed a decade earlier survived. And these few national currencies still exist not because they were too big to be replaced but because they were too small.  -Marcelo Prates, CoinDesk columnist, central bank lawyer  15. More barter through tokens  1. There will be a proliferation of new economies that will have their own form of barter (for example, tokens as a medium of exchange such as in-game tokens like SLP, ETH). They will be accepted as a medium of exchange directly.  2. Blockchain-enabled easy to use applications to facilitate custody, trade for tokenized forms of money.  3. Medium of exchange will fix itself over a basket of other currencies (could be ETH, BTC, USD, EUR, etc.), sliding away from the single USD currency around that point in time  -Beryl Li, co-founder, Yield Guild Games.  Next, in a clever hedge, Dovey Wan gives us two predictions, one dystopian and one optimistic. (The reader can decide which is which.)  16. Programmable fiat leads to confiscations  Programmable fiat monetary policy and CBDC will make arbitrary seizure and irrevocable confiscation within a few lines of codes.  -Dovey Wan, founder of Primitive Crypto  Her next prediction:  17. Crypto spurs wealth redistribution  Mordor central banking system does not create wealth, only the perception of wealth. The “Great Concentration” of fiat wealth and “Great Redistribution” from fiat to crypto wealth are happening in parallel this decade.  -Dovey Wan  18. Money no longer reflects human value  Today, it’s often said that money has three primary functions: a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account. But more than that, money is often seen as a reflection of how much you are worth to this world and how much that coffee is worth to you. Money is value. But as I look around, I see the concepts of money and value becoming less and less intertwined.  -Taylor Monahan, founder and CEO, MyCrypto  Also part of Future of Money Week:  The Future of Money: A History - Dan Jeffries  Who Sets the Rules of Bitcoin as Nation-States and Corps Roll In - David Z. Morris  The World Bitcoin Will Build - Cory Klippsten  19. Centralized services are connected by decentralized rails  Let me paint a picture that might or might not come to pass. You have a bunch of centralized services and islands connected by decentralized blockchain rails… I think a lot of services are going to need to still be isolated and centralized because that’s what’s most computationally efficient, but the network as a whole could be largely decentralized.  You can move between any service easily on standardized blockchain rails, which would be extremely valuable. If there’s an easy, standardized way, in 30 seconds, to move assets from one platform to another – that doesn’t exist outside of crypto right now, and it’s a huge hindrance.  Payments could be effectively instant on blockchain rails. This is true of money, and that’s true of assets as well – assets get tokenized … Payment apps and in-store objects support that, [and that’s] probably happening largely over mobile. I think that is something which would be in many ways more efficient, and easy to scale and grow, than the system we have today. I’d be pretty excited to see something like that.  -Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO, FTX  20. Money gets weirder  My prediction for the future of money is that it’s going to get a lot weirder. It will be more closely tied to, or allow a greater expression of, our identities and our individuality. It will reflect our relationships in both the physical and digital worlds.  It’s going to accelerate globalization in bringing together people with similar values across borders – and tying them together with financial incentives and an identity that is intensified and deepened with financial value involved. And all that is going to shake up the traditional world of governments, different legal jurisdictions and different local currencies.  -Laura Shin, host of “The Unchained” podcast.

It will be more closely tied to, or allow a greater expression of, our identities and our individuality.” – Laura Shin, podcaster  Money used to be simple. Central banks issued it. You earned it, spent it, rarely thought about it.  Then came bitcoin and, as they say, everything changed. We realized that you don’t need governments to make money, and in fact anyone, individually or collectively, could create it for themselves.  Layer 2′s “Crypto 2022″ series started with Policy Week in October, followed by Future of Money Week in November and Culture Week this week. GET ALL THE CONTENT HERE.  And create it, they have.  In the last few years we’ve seen countless coin and token projects, some serious, many idiosyncratic, all in their own way making claims about the future of money.  Read more: The Future of Money: 20 Predictions  These pioneers made ETH and tether, doge and shib, central bank digital currencies (CBDC), social tokens, non-fungible tokens and much more, showing that money can be many things and what matters, often, isn’t the technology but whether people believe in the project. A money’s value, in other words, is a function of a community of believers and investors.  And, we’re only getting started. Money is multiplying in its forms and uses. It’s unbundling (relieving itself of the need to be a store of value, unit of account and medium of exchange all at the same time). It’s becoming programmable (more like software than hardware). And it’s becoming more and more fun: a reflection of culture, memes and the best and worst of the internet.  As podcaster Laura Shin told us, money increasingly mirrors “our identities and our individuality.”  She also said: “My prediction for the future of money is that it’s going to get a lot weirder.”  Which is a perfect encapsulation of this increasingly wild and varied field of innovation. Whatever you think the future looks like – and we’ll have plenty of ideas this week – it’s surely stranger.

He will remain a member of Twitter’s board of directors until his term expires in the middle of 2022.  Parag Agrawal, who has worked at Twitter for more than a decade and has been Twitter’s chief technology officer since 2017, was unanimously appointed as Dorsey’s replacement by Twitter’s board of directors, effective immediately.  “I’ve decided to leave Twitter because I believe the company is ready to move on from its founders,” wrote Dorsey in a statement. “My trust in Parag as Twitter’s CEO is deep. His work over the past 10 years has been transformational. I’m deeply grateful for his skill, heart, and soul. It’s his time to lead.”  Dorsey subsequently tweeted a more detailed explanation of why he was stepping down, saying there were multiple reasons why now was the right time for him to leave the company.  Dorsey is a well-known fan of bitcoin, having initiated several projects involving the crypto both through Twitter and through payments company Square, of which he is also CEO. A source with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed that Dorsey’s role at Square remains unchanged.  Twitter’s stock initially jumped as much as 11% on the news, but trading was then halted by the NYSE due to “news pending.” They resumed trading at 15:56 UTC and were lately up 4.6%. Shares of Square were up about 0.5%.  CNBC first reported Monday that Dorsey was expected to step down as CEO of Twitter.  According to CNBC, Twitter stakeholder Elliott Management had tried to replace Dorsey as Twitter’s CEO last year because of concerns about his ability to run two public companies. But Elliott and Twitter eventually reached an agreement to have Dorsey continue in both roles.  This is a developing story and will be updated.

The reason for the more than two-week long debacle was an unfortunate coincidence of events, “not quite the shady circumstances that some had suggested,” the exchange wrote in a blog post.  “No single entity was at fault,” the exchange wrote, and “no one’s getting fired.”  Earlier in November, the exchange implemented a software update for the popular meme coin, and the update triggered a glitch: Old users’ transactions from 2019 were re-played, and Binance re-sent DOGE from its wallet to the same addresses that users withdrew their coins to back in 2019. Binance said 1,634 users were affected by this issue.  As a result, the exchange lost some funds from its treasury, so it then turned back to users whose transactions were replayed and asked them to return the DOGE. However, the users didn’t even know their old transactions had been repeated, and some of them didn’t even have any DOGE in their accounts anymore, they told CoinDesk.  Binance told those users they had to return the coins; otherwise, any crypto on their balance equivalent to the amount erroneously sent by the exchange would be frozen. One week later, Elon Musk tweeted at Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, saying that the situation “sounds shady.”  Soon after that, Binance published an update saying it was rebuilding its dogecoin wallet.  In today’s blog post, the exchange blamed the issue on “a combination of unlikely factors” related to the dogecoin blockchain upgrade from the previous version.  “What began as a fairly straightforward upgrade, turned into an issue where Binance users were unable to withdraw DOGE for the last 17 days,” the exchange said.  According to the affected users, who have been exchanging updates in a dedicated Telegram group, most of them finally got their accounts unfrozen at some point last week. However, one user told CoinDesk that he’s still waiting for his situation to be resolved.",NEUTRAL,DOGE,BLOCKCHAIN | DOGE | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/29/binance-reports-resolving-issue-with-its-doge-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea5d9206f9cfd4fb3db217bf5730870598e84cc7-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The project announced the funding round on Monday, led by Three Arrows Capital, SoftBank and DeFiance Capital, with participation from Skyvision Capital, Solar Eco Fund, Sesterce Capital and Gate.io.  With money streaming, instead of receiving a payment such as a salary every two weeks smaller payments can be made over shorter periods of time, even covering a fraction of a second.  Users can then dedicate a fixed percentage of their money stream to be staked on lending protocols or swapped for other cryptocurrencies, all via an automated process. Money streaming can also be used to process subscription services, a largely untapped market in the crypto economy.  Earlier this month, money streaming protocol Zebec raised a $6 million round to offer similar services on Solana. As more traditional finance investors take the plunge into DeFi, venture capital firms have been quick to back companies like Mean DAO that attract users with accessible and permissionless applications that could never exist in traditional settings.  Mean DAO is currently made up of over 19,000 members serving 31,000 users on its platform, according to a press release. Mean DAO is also preparing to launch its own banking application, “MeanFi,” which is built on the Mean protocol.  “We invest in DeFi eating traditional finance,” Arthur Cheong, founding partner at DeFiance Capital, said in a press release. “Mean Protocol is seeing explosive growth on Solana and DeFiance is proud to back the team in their quest to bring in the next billion users into crypto.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | SPONSORED,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/29/money-streaming-mean-dao-raises-35m-to-boost-defi-on-solana,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/33f9e395e609919b7f43c60cd65df7533fef689d-1600x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, crypto-related risks to the country’s financial stability are currently low because they are mostly isolated from the mainstream financial system, the report says.  The reports cite a July poll of Russia’s largest banks. It does not give details on the kinds of transactions or how banks identify those that are crypto related. The Bank of Russia had not responded to a CoinDesk request for details by publication time.  “According to some indirect estimates, Russian investors in digital currencies are among the most active on the market,” the report says. Russia is one of the biggest markets for Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, and the number of Russian users on other global trading platforms is increasing, according to the report.  The growing interest for crypto could become a risk for Russia’s financial stability, the regulator said. “Bitcoin and other digital currencies aren’t backed by anything, investments might be lost because of price volatility, fraud or cyber threats,” the report says.  Crypto’s anonymity makes it popular for uses such as money laundering, drug trafficking and terrorism financing, thwarting efforts to prevent those activities by the regulators. Another risk is that people might put part of their savings into crypto, a problem similar to when consumers prefer foreign currencies to their national one for savings, the report notes.  The report also mentions concerns related to energy consumption in the process of cryptocurrency mining, which is “negatively affecting the climate.”  The regulator needs to keep monitoring the market for new threats, the document adds.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/29/russians-conduct-5b-worth-of-crypto-transactions-a-year-central-bank-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f4b360d6c98af1385786c3a1e4028a37828d0837-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency’s immediate prospects remain tied to the newly detected coronavirus variant named Omicron’s potential impact on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.  The top cryptocurrency by market value was trading near $57,300 at press time, representing a 7.3% gain compared to the low of $53,359 on late Sunday. Prices hit a high of $58,270 during the Asian hours.  The futures tied to the S&P 500 were trading 0.9% higher alongside gains in the pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 index and other risk assets like the Australian dollar and crude oil.  Buyers made a comeback on early Monday as reports from South Africa stated that Omicron patients seen so far have had “extremely mild symptoms.” On Friday, bitcoin and risk assets in general tanked after the news of a supposedly vaccine-resistant COVID-19 variant coming out of South Africa raised the specter of economically painful lockdowns. The World Health Organization (WHO) deemed the Omicron variant a variant of concern.  “Bitcoin is largely being grouped with other risk assets at the moment,” Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, said. “After Friday’s collapse in equities, we have seen some buying in major coins, but it’s too early to say whether it will continue.”  There is a consensus in the market that central banks and governments would quickly step in with more stimulus if asset prices slide on potential lockdowns in major economies.  The Fed recently announced the beginning of the gradual unwinding of its $120 billion per month asset purchase program. According to Goldman Sachs, the central bank could accelerate the so-called taper from January.  Traders are likely to closely watch Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony to U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.  Bitcoin may resume the broader upward trajectory if Powell assures markets of unlimited support in the event of a worsening pandemic. According to WHO, the risk associated with Omicron is very high, adding that the newly found variant is “highly divergent” and likely to spread at a very high speed.  While Powell is scheduled to give the opening remarks at an event introducing the New York Innovation Center at 8:03 p.m. UTC on Monday, the chairman is unlikely to comment on coronavirus, inflation and interest rates.

India’s crypto industry is facing serious regulatory uncertainty, thanks to a proposed bill that plans to ban most forms of private cryptocurrencies.  The proposed bill damped expectations that the government’s legislative proposal would support a more friendly stance towards crypto, in light of growing adoption in the country.  However, CoinDCX remains hopeful about its initial public offering (IPO) plans and thinks such a move would grant legitimacy to the industry. “As soon as the government or the situations allow us, we will try for an IPO,” Khandelwal said.  The exchange wants to instill confidence in the industry through its IPO, the same way Coinbase did with its listing, Khandelwal added.  The timeline of the IPO will be determined based on incoming government regulation, the co-founder said.  CoinDCX said in a statement that, like many other growing companies, it has IPO aspirations but has no specific timescale for doing so. “We would like to reiterate that there is no immediate plan in the foreseeable future to announce an IPO,” CoinDCX added in an email to CoinDesk.  The crypto exchange became a unicorn , a privately held company with over $1 billion valuation, after a $90 million funding round in August this year. The company received funding from Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin’s B Capital Group, Coinbase, Polychain Capital, Block.one and Jump Capital.

In this article, we break down the why and the how. But first let&apos;s explain how we got here. NFTs — Non-Fungible Tokens — have taken much of the internet by storm. In 2020, it was an obscure term familiar only to the most entrenched Ethereum enthusiasts. Now, they are a household world and not only that - a buzzword representing tech innovation. Dozens of other major blockchains now support NFTs - from Bitcoin to Binance Smart Chain. NFTs are unique tokens or digital signatures created on a blockchain (decentralized ledger supported by many different computers on the internet). The process done to create an NFT is called &apos;minting&apos; an NFT. NFTs and cryptocurrencies - the other type of token on a blockchain - have one major difference. Cryptocurrencies, like any currency, are fungible - designed to be swapped out or replaced by many others just like it. A $20 bill, a quarter, a gallon of water at the supermarket can be replaced by many others just like it. A non-fungible token is an opposite - it is unique. Something non-fungible in everyday life would be a driver&apos;s license. It might cost someone $400 of time and money to get a driver&apos;s license, but one cannot simply hand someone $400 in return for their driver&apos;s license. You need your own unique version.

In 2020, it was only US$355 million, which shows how impressive of a run NFTs have made to create a new asset class in the crypto industry. At the beginning of 2021, the market was mainly dominated by sports highlights and trading cards. But in the second half of the year, we saw NFTs take new forms, which created multiple market segments such as virtual real estate, gaming avatars, and fashion. Seeing the growth and evolution of NFTs, investors started to see long-term value in NFT and metaverse-based projects. As a result, many NFT gaming companies that aim to create virtual worlds raised tens of millions of dollars. An example is True Global Ventures which invested US$10 million into a metaverse leader, The Sandbox which is launching their Alpha access at the end of November 2021. The goal here is to take NFTs beyond digital art and status symbols. As the underlying technology, blockchain, of NFTs allows for greater transparency and trust in ownership, it can be used in creating new business models or making the existing ones more efficient.

In the past, most of these projects failed due to legal issues, privacy concerns, and other inefficiencies. However, the introduction of blockchain technology in the space has sparked a new hope in the heart of bettors as it ensures a secure and safe space for sport betting enthusiasts. The pre-blockchain scenario compelled users to act solely on trust that the platform will put their bets in due time and accurately. Besides, they had to rely on an unknown betting mechanism in an opaque and unfair environment. But blockchain can potentially change the way betting works by distributing the responsibility of tracking transactions across a broad network of participants. Blockchain technology also introduces DAO in the online sports betting space. A DAO or Decentralized Autonomous Organization is an organization that does not have a single entity controlling the odds of the project but its community and investors. DAO can potentially change the online sports betting industry by distributing control and making the platform fair and transparent.

42396434,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT3Tqc,1638168364,DeFi Protocol Omicron’s Token Jumps 10-Fold After Namesake COVID Variant Emerges,"The World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday named the newly detected SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.529 as Omicron and deemed it as a variant of concern, sending bitcoin and the broader crypto market into a tailspin along with equities.  However, one little-known cryptocurrency stayed resilient and chalked up a tenfold rally over the weekend.  OMIC, the native coin of decentralized reserve currency protocol with the same name as the newly detected COVID-19 variant Omicron, picked up a bid near $70 late Friday and rose as high as $711 on Sunday, according to data from Crypto.com.  The token’s surge perhaps represents peak irrationality – a case of cryptocurrency rallying just because its parent blockchain coincidentally shares the name with the new COVID-19 variant.  The bond-based yield farming project Omicron is built on Ethereum scaling technology Arbitrum but has no connection to the coronavirus, and OMIC is far from being a safe haven asset.  While the token’s maximum supply is capped at 1,000,000 OMIC, data providers like Messari, Crypto.com and CoinGecko do not provide details about the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization. Some observers are looking at OMIC’s spike as evidence of bubble-like conditions in the crypto market.  OMIC is backed by a basket of assets, including stablecoin USDC, and is listed solely on decentralized exchange SushiSwap.  OMIC Holders can stake their coins in return for more tokens. “The main benefit for stakers comes from supply growth. The protocol mints new OMIC tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers,” an official explainer says. “Thus, the gain for stakers will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration.”  The OMIC token is currently changing hands at $625. The broader crypto market has also regained some poise, with bitcoin recovering to $57,500, having slipped nearly 9% to $53,800 on Friday.  The futures tied to the S&P 500 are also pointing to risk reset with a 0.5% gain.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ARB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/29/defi-protocol-omicrons-token-jumps-10-fold-after-namesake-covid-variant-emerges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8bc774a28da049013a1b9b65e392584ec06330c-1898x848.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
