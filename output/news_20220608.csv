42415311,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRnal,1654730546,First Mover Asia: Crypto’s Institutional Future May Be Incompatible With Litecoin’s Privacy Protecting Features; Bitcoin Falls,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and most major altcoins spent much of Wednesday in the red.  Insights: South Korean exchanges are delisting litecoin.  Technician's take (Editor's Note): Technician's Take is on hiatus today.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $30,285 -2.5%  Ether (ETH): $1,798 -0.01%  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Algorand ALGO +4.4% Smart Contract Platform Cardano ADA +4.2% Smart Contract Platform Chainlink LINK +2.1% Computing  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Cosmos ATOM −4.9% Smart Contract Platform Internet Computer ICP −4.2% Computing Litecoin LTC −3.1% Currency  Bitcoin, Ether and Most Other Major Cryptos See Red  Home, home in the range...  Bitcoin remained close to the middle of the price range it has been occupying for much of the past month since the collapse of the terraUSD stablecoin (UST) and the LUNA token that supported it.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $30,300, down roughly 2.5% over the past 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at about $1,800, about flat over the same period. Most other major cryptos spent much of their day in the red with DOT and AVAX recently down over 3% and SOL declining more than 2%. LINK was among the winners, rising approximately 2%.  Crypto prices, which have largely correlated to stocks, dovetailed again with major indices. The S&P 500 fell about 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech heavy Nasdaq declined a little bit less as investors continued their watchful waiting for clearer indications on the direction of inflation and the economy.  This week's signs have been decidedly negative with the World Bank cutting its forecast for economic growth this year from 4.1% to 2.9% amid fears of stagflation – a toxic combination of slowing growth and rising prices – pessimistic inflationary comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen at a Senate Finance Committee hearing, and a profit warning by Target that sent retail stock prices tumbling Tuesday. Meanwhile, the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine continued with the price of Brent crude oil, a widely regarded measure of energy markets, soaring above $122, up nearly 60% since the start of the year.  Cryptos have struggled against this wider backdrop and because of brewing uncertainties in the space, including not only the Terra debacle but regulatory uncertainty and problems with other protocols.  ""BTC fundamentals are intact, but without regulatory clarity, which is coming, we may stay range-bound, ""3iQ Digital Asset's Head of Research Mark Connors wrote to CoinDesk.  Connors also noted the failure of the Ethereum 2.0 migration as a testnet to occur. ""In our opinion, proof-of-stake may be a 2023 reality, so not constructive for ether,"" he wrote.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,115 -1%  DJIA: 32,910 -0.8%  Nasdaq: 12,086 -0.7%  Gold: $1,852 -0.03%  Insights  Major Korean Exchanges Are Delisting Litecoin  The last time Litecoin was relevant was when it was the subject of a fake news release about a partnership with Walmart.  But Litecoin finds itself in the news again as major Korean exchanges are delisting its LTC token because of privacy upgrades involving the MimbleWimble protocol, designed to make transactions confidential and virtually untraceable.  Korea’s largest exchanges cite the nation's law on the ""Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information"" as the reason they need to de-list the tokens, but this isn't a Korea-specific thing. Korea's law was designed to align with the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) travel rule, a set of anti-money laundering standards adopted by regulators and financial institutions worldwide that requires the collection of customer data around transactions. Every major economy understands this and has implemented similar rules.  Rules like this are the only reason institutions can even think about adopting crypto. For institutions, compliance is key, and they need to stay miles away from anything that even smells like money laundering.  Many major banks know what happens if they get caught: fines in the billions. HSBC, Standard Chartered and others have all been hit with mega-fines for insufficient anti-money laundering controls.  Crypto’s future is in institutional adoption, but there are certain things that just won’t work. While financial privacy is important and exists in crypto via the difficulty in identifying owners being blockchain wallets, financial anonymity is where the line is drawn. Making it impossible to track transactions ensures that institutions must separate themselves from the project and play no part in it.  Certainly there are other protocols out there that are designed to obfuscate transactions. Tornado Cash comes to mind, and is often used in the same sentence as “stolen funds.” But even Tornado Cash doesn’t completely mix anonymity with freedom to transact: Wallets sanctioned by OFAC are blocked. Experts who have previously spoken to CoinDesk have said that without this happening, OFAC would be actively targeting the protocol.  Litecoin mixing anonymity with an absence of such controls is going to be a headache for exchanges that list the LTC token. Korean exchanges are said to be particularly sensitive to regulatory affairs, so it’s natural that they would delist it first. But others are sure to follow. Perhaps Binance, battling a reputational challenge as a haven for cybercrooks, will be next?

These sell-offs have been responsible for the decline in prices recorded in the digital asset over the last couple of months. Naturally, sell-off trends can be recorded on their magnitude depending on when the trading hours of a particular region are open.

The project was founded by Wang and others including former World Economic Forum executive Sheila Warren and Lauren Serota, former head of service design at Myanmar’s Yoma Bank. (Both Warren and Serota are full-time in Web 3 now.)  The hackathon, which runs until Aug. 31, 2022, takes a two-stage, multi-month approach and will focus on the five “challenge areas” of generational wealth, financial health, sustainable culture and communities, environmental wellbeing and disaster response, Wang said.  “There's an ideation stage and then there's an ‘actually build it’ stage,” she said. The problem with most crypto hackathons – and perhaps crypto in general – is a lack of quality data about what projects have or are likely to have real traction. They rarely “reflect the needs of society they need to understand,"" Wang said.  CRADL’s hackathon is primarily targeted towards developers and builders, and an on-boarding process will help them clearly “understand” the “hyperlocal” problems they’re trying to solve in addition to knowing how to apply this “incredible technology.”  “You can't just go straight to building something on-chain first,” she said. Another part of CRADL focuses on existing projects to study the most effective, most coordinated and most ambitious to “open source” that data for a global community of builders.  See also: Consensus 2022 Visitor Guide: CBDCs and Public Money  This could help dispel the myth that blockchain is only about speculation and motivate policymakers in the West, “where there's a resistance to crypto,” Wang said. Efforts like CRADL’s “Proof of Impact” report are helping tell real stories about overcoming and mitigating inflation and authoritarianism, Wang said.  And so, in a sense, CRADL is a tastemaker and crown-bestower through its research and hackathon projects.  “These are the genuine use cases and stories that we need to elevate more,” Wang said. Like Pom’s project, the aim is ultimately to build effective tech. But first you need a motivating narrative.  “How do we make sure that, in the end, everything leads to more on-boarding, more adoption?” Wang asked.

42420958,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcX6kyz,1654722204,Bamboo Aims to Make Crypto Investing More Inviting,"Bamboo believes its user-friendly, micro-investment and savings application (app) is a way to make crypto investment easier and less scary for consumers.  In a few weeks, the company, which has focused strictly on the Australian market throughout its four-year history and has about 70,000 downloads, will make the Bamboo app available in the U.S.  This article is part of Road to Consensus  Bamboo is one of eight finalists in the Web 3 Pitch Fest, a hackathon hosted by Extreme Tech Challenge at CoinDesk’s Consensus Festival this week.  Bamboo CEO Blake Cassidy said the huge American crypto market was a logical next step. The current bearish atmosphere may even offer an opportunity to convert increasingly risk-averse investors by enabling them to accrue digital assets safely in small increments. He said the app had already generated tens of thousands of U.S. inquiries, a reflection of its simple interface and clear aims.  “You don’t come to the app and interface with charts and order books and sophisticated tools like leveraged trading,” Cassidy told CoinDesk. “It’s crypto with bumpers. We’re setting up people for success.”  The app operates on the assumption that crypto investment is daunting for most people, who are cowed by its volatility and potential losses. Bamboo allows users to make small cryptocurrency investments by rounding off retail transactions to even dollar amounts above what they paid. It’s similar to the model that some charities have adopted in partnership with retailers.  For example, you can invest just a quarter in crypto by rounding the $2.75 you pay for a cup of coffee to $3. Bamboo also offers the option to invest significantly more, up to $20,000 a day, or via weekly installments, although Cassidy noted the company is not an exchange but rather “focused on being a savings app.”  “So many people are interested in the sector but they can’t stand the risks,” he said. “So giving people an easy-to-use product to invest their spare change is a great way for them to learn before they invest further.”  Bamboo earns money through fees ranging from 0.8% for transactions above $300 to 2.5% on a sliding scale below that threshold. The smaller the transaction, the larger the fee. A closed-loop system ensures that users can’t withdraw their crypto from the platform but rather must sell it into a linked bank account.  The company was the brainchild of four Australia-based developers who founded Bamboo in 2018. (The name is a playful swipe at the micro-investment app Acorns – in that “bamboo grows faster than acorns,” Cassidy said.) Two years later, Cassidy, who had been working in various blockchain roles and was an early investor, became part of a purchasing group that paid an undisclosed sum. “We just thought there was a market need,” he said.  Since then, Bamboo has raised $3.5 million in seed funding and expanded its workforce to 25 people, spread over Asia, Europe, Australia and the U.S. (Bamboo has registered as a holding company in Australia.) About half are developers with the remainder in marketing and financial operations roles. Cassidy hopes to close the next capital round this year via venture firms and strategic investors who see value in products that create favorable user experiences.  “We’re helping users invest sustainably over time so they can help achieve their medium- and long-range goals,” he said. “We’re very much a savings app built for people.”  Read More: Why Invest in Cryptocurrency?",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/08/bamboo-aims-to-make-crypto-investing-more-inviting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/878b5c61e448bcb5ef4702adf9702d65333a3d0d-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420965,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcX6l49,1654721639,'I Jumped in With All 4': Legendary Cryptographer David Chaum on the Future of Web3,"David Chaum, the legacy cryptographer, thinks what crypto is doing today has a real shot of changing the world. He drew a comparison to 30 years ago, around the time his company, DigiCash – the one that earned him the moniker the ""Godfather of Cryptocurrency"" – sent its first online transaction.  “I jumped in with all four,” he said. “I wasn't hedging my bets.”  The article is part of Road to Consensus  It's a familiar story: Chaum was early to see the potential good and horror of the internet. On one hand, he predicted a surveillance trap. On the other, he saw a communications tool that could reinvent everything from commerce to voting. He felt incredibly motivated to start building the tools that would empower individuals and prevent the total usurpation of the internet by governments and corporations.  It all depended on the widespread adoption of cryptography (or the ability to encode secrets), which was anything but guaranteed at the time. In fact, in a recent series of interviews ahead of CoinDesk’s Consensus festival, Chaum shared that he was confronted point-blank by federal agents because of his work with encryption.  The secret of cryptography got out, but Chaum’s first business did not – it failed in what an anonymous insider called a blowout of ""paranoia, idealism, amateurism and greed."" Chaum's digital cash tool was built using cryptography to compete against centralized players like credit cards and banks – and it's still remembered as a flash of brilliance. More so because many of Chaum's worst predictions came to pass.  Somehow, Chaum is still optimistic, he told CoinDesk. He’s now an unabashed supporter of the blockchain industry, which can evade the pitfalls of proprietary technology and centralized corporations. He's often still called the ""Godfather of Cryptocurrency"" (one of Satoshi Nakamoto's few citations given in the Bitcoin whitepaper), and his cryptography research into blind signatures, group signatures, mix networks, secure digital voting and zero-knowledge proofs, and more, is still fertile ground for modern crypto developers.  See also: Consensus 2022 Visitor Guide: CBDCs and Public Money  Chaum’s latest company, xx network, is an attempt to future-proof this technology by creating a “quantum-resistant” blockchain – or a crypto that cannot be broken by a supercomputer. Indeed, if Web3 is meant to stick around for the long haul, it needs to put humans first. That means privacy, security and real innovation. Chaum thinks he's got it right this time.  CoinDesk caught up with Chaum for two hour-long conversations one day in May. Chaum, who has reason to brag, loves to discuss his accolades and has a healthy skepticism of the press that may be apparent in the lightly edited transcript. There's a sense that his current work is being ignored, and that he doesn't always get the credit he knows he's earned. As the conversation moved from his legacy to his latest work to his motivations both then and now, he grew more reflective.  Web3 developers, he said, need to find the right mix of passion, philosophy and know-how if they want to sustain the ongoing fight for public cryptography over generations. But he thinks no matter what, this web with ""a conscience"" is on the right side of history. And he thinks he will still be making contributions. ""Watch this space,"" he said, adding that his latest (yet-to-publish) writing on cryptography will again be game-changing.  The conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity. (And, by the way, Chaum said he has been doing pretty grueling physical therapy recently, so be kind if you see him in Austin, Texas, at Consensus.)  What do you see as your role in the industry? Do you see yourself as a world-famous historical figure?  Well, I don't think anyone should answer questions like that, but let me just turn the clock back 40 years. If there's one thing that I want to communicate here, it's that 40 years ago, I saw the inevitable progression of the digital world very clearly. It was inevitable that the continuing trend of escalating digital technology – which, at the time, was providing new opportunities, new entertainment for consumers – for the general public operating at that level, their information would not be protected. It would inevitably be siphoned off – overtly, covertly or clandestinely – and used as an unprecedented source of power in society.  There was the possibility of using cryptography – which I realized now later in life, I risked my whole life by publishing in journals on American soil to set cryptography free from jail in the 1980s – which has the potential to reverse that trend and allow people to wrest control over the maintenance and use of information about themselves.  That's the way I framed it. You can go back and read those articles – I saw it as a kind of cops-and-robbers situation that would only escalate. As people become more aware of these issues, there would be more pushback and then – what I predicted as a best case scenario – there would be an opportunity for companies to provide people with these kinds of protections and win over the public. The xx network is endeavoring to be that company. I mean, it's not like we don't have a clear-cut road map and the technology to do it.  Consistency is rare in this industry.  The wind hasn't always been at my back, Daniel.  What do you say to people who think crypto is a solution in search of a problem?  I guess I don't spend much time thinking about what to say. I read all the major stuff that comes out on Web3 – it's quite a broad spectrum, none of it fully reverential. Everybody's hedging their bets. You know, when I jumped in 40 years ago, I jumped in with all four. I wasn't hedging my bets. I wasn't making some prediction where I could say I was right whatever happened.  I'm not just talking by book, I’m walking the walk. That’s the essence of it: creating the technology to enable it because that's not a slam dunk. And it is a creative act, because it's not easy to see how to make it.  Even after 13 years of boom and bust cycles, there’s no sort of hesitancy?  I don't prognosticate about prices of various things – I don't have the bandwidth – but I would say that I'm not 100% sold on this being another 18-month bear market. If people in the industry keep talking like this, yes, it will be. Who knows? But to me, Web3 is bigger than that. With what I saw 40 years ago, the inevitable growth of digital technology is showing no signs of slowing down. It is moving forward [because] these problems are continuing to get worse and worse.  If the people who are trying to push forward a solution based on the current level of technology all lose their mojo, then that's just going to harm everyone. I'll still be there, trying to find the new technologies and new segues and do my utmost to give an opportunity to everybody on the planet. It’s not countercultural for technology’s sake, but about creating a real alternative for ordinary people to vote with their feet.  You've called Web3 a more ""conscious"" web. What does that mean?  Well, I wouldn't say that. It has been redefined several times, as you may know.  You've described it as “the web with a conscience.” What does that really mean?  With all due respect, I don't think this is the right moment to enunciate a more borne-out definition. If you look at the irrefutable, serious, responsible public-opinion polling, it shows that the vast majority of people are not happy with so-called Web2. Their main unhappiness is the fact that they've lost control of their data and privacy. I hope that Web3 will solve those issues.  A lot of your early work focused on voting. You’ve also written a lot recently – on CoinDesk and elsewhere – on the notion of democracy. Has your thinking on the subject changed?  It's been my experience that voting, democracy, has been intertwined with privacy in various ways over the past 40 years. When I invented mixing, a way to form anonymous communication channels, I did so as a solution to part of the voting problem. Voting is a kind of prototypical poster child for situations where you need privacy. That’s undisputed. But it's more subtle than that – you see, it's not really privacy you need when voting but what we call ballot secrecy, which is a different thing. The public – you can say the state but I would say the public – in a democracy has an interest in voters being unable to show others how they have voted.  Why is that?  Because of the danger to democracy that is posed by what we call “improper influence” in the voting sphere – or vote buying and coercion or any combination thereof. Today, the possibility of vote buying is far more problematic than it's ever really been. That's just a true statement. Before we had the so-called secret ballot – which is like a 150-year-old institution recovered from the Greeks and reinvented as the so-called Australian ballot – which is basically marking a ballot in a booth and putting it in a box, we had a system that was way too manipulatable.  Nowadays, the hope for democracy is not based on just more-of-the-same kind of polling-place voting. We need new kinds of voting, and more voting. I don't mean that it has to take more time from people, but it does have to be more meaningful – but that's a whole 'nother subject.  Democracy needs more-engaging voting, and that's probably not going to be in booths. But the electronic solution is so obvious, if you want to allow voting outside of booths. Nowadays, I can livestream my voting act very easily, I can receive payments electronically and nation-state law only extends as far as the national boundaries. Coercion is trivial. So there’s a real chance we are not going to be able to take advantage of electronic technology to enhance or improve democracy in the ways that I think could save it.  Does privacy make this impossible?  It's essential that we have inalienable privacy. Society has an interest in people not giving away their secrets.  There is an argument to be made that electronic technologies or digital transformation has challenged democracy. Why should we have faith in tech to expand democracy through the type of voting that you're talking about?  That’s an interesting way to look at things. I hope we could make the distinction between Web2 technology – where if cryptography is used, it's only a small concession to users – and the extraordinary power of multiparty computation, which is a profoundly different way to do information technology.  I recently got this “most enduring” award for a theoretical computer-science paper written 30 years ago on MPC – a term I coined. This is something that's sort of like a smart contract but is far more powerful. Multiparty computation could be easily proven to be the equivalent of the Church-Turing thesis in the context of secure computation.  In other words, we don't know that a Turing machine could do such computation [concerning natural numbers], but we believe it. And similarly, because we think Turing machines look like they could do anything, what we've proposed is that multiparty computation can solve any security problem that is well defined. So if you could write the software, and it is run by good and honest agents, then I believe we’ve solved many security problems.  And that’s the interesting thing about the digital world: That’s now quietly advanced to the point where that’s now possible where it wasn't really practical when I proposed it 30 years ago. One thing I keep in mind when I think about technology and society is that somehow the needs of the people haven't really changed much in 2,500 years. It’s constant, but computing power is, like, doubling every year. That's huge. If it isn’t already, if we sit on our hands for another week, multiparty computation is going to be very practical.  Sorry if I sound a little aggressive. It's been a rough day. I had to battle with my physical therapist earlier today.  I'm sorry to hear that.  If you go back and look at the literature, look at my website, publications, what you'll see is that – together with my co-authors where we invented called quantum cryptography and in a separate multiparty computation paper – I showed a construction that included both models [for private computation]: zero knowledge and minimum disclosure. Those are dual models. And the public has now been misled into conflating them and thinking I had nothing to do with it, when I in fact proved both models. To say that I've done research on zero knowledge is a little bit, you know, unfairly deprecating.  Didn't mean anything by it. My question was more about the future of theoretical research, considering your background in academia and applying concepts in blockchain. Do you think the cryptocurrency industry is meaningfully contributing to the body of useful computer science?  You know, I have complained about academia from time to time. I founded the International Association for Cryptologic Research about 30 years ago – possibly risking going to jail for having done so. That's what the NSA said, but we did it anyway. That organization continues to be the organization for researching cryptography globally. We have a journal and three or four flagship conferences each year – workshops.  Around the time of the Snowden revelations, I took it upon myself to survey people at one of those conferences – the 650, 800 people who were there – about what they felt about the government spying on us. I was literally shocked – before Snowden, I never made a personal decision whether the government was really spying on everything or not. I just left it as unknown because it was just unclear, but still focused on countermeasures. Anyway, I can say objectively that none of these academics – it's mainly academics and some industry people who attend these events – the real people who know about cryptography are very concerned about this.  I found that very upsetting. It’s a nice cocktail-party line for academics to say they want to change the world. They're not trying to save anything. In the blockchain space, we're sort of clear on what the incentives are. It isn’t so clear in academia. So, I came away from that deciding that I should jump back into it and actually try to do something about this. Because things were going horribly wrong.  [EDITORS NOTE: Later that day, Chaum and I continued our conversation.]  You’ve written about the particular risks of data accumulation in light of artificial intelligence (AI), and that we could never know what AI would do with that information. Is there a path where AI is actually good for the world?  You know, Daniel, I grew up in LA, and there's a story about some Sheriff McCoy, 40 years ago, who had stolen a copy of the police department’s records and was using it out of his garage or something. I'm not fully characterizing this, but it was an incident that changed my thinking permanently.  In the analog world, you can run up against limits. When a supposed guardian goes awry, you can catch them. There’s a paper trail. The digital world does not have that kind of issue. It keeps moving forward at an exponential rate. With AI, you could talk all day long about what the ultimate form of it is and whether that's even possible – there are probably crazy people running this stuff in their garage, using it for no good. And if there aren't, there will be.  It's so trite to say, but you can't stop this. It's already happening – it's part of progress. The question is: Is there a way through for democracy? I believe there is. I have a road map, I have a plan, I've written some serious, thoughtful stuff on it, which has not yet been released. But, you know, watch this space. As I mentioned before, multiparty computation is a powerful thing. AI is a powerful thing. Maybe we can pit one against the other in a clever way to solve these issues. And I found a way to do that.  Do you wish that you had done DigiCash differently?  I've been asked this question by very unfriendly media. My answer was that I don't feel any regrets whatsoever about DigiCash. In those days, we were working on these distributed and decentralized systems. We converted our beautiful conference room into a “decentralized cash” lab, and worked on into the evenings. It was a passion – but you know, in those days computers weren't really up to it. So there was nowhere to go. It's nothing to do with the way we ran the company.  You asked me, do I feel regret? I do not. Somehow, people are much more concerned about losing their money than their privacy. And so, before e-commerce was really a thing, it was hard to convince people they needed money on the internet. Same when ATM machines were introduced, it took about 10 years before people would trust them enough to use them. You know that?  So having ecash at that juncture, where the technology wasn't really able to support it in anything less than a highly centralized model – it wasn't the computing power to have today that can support thousands of nodes replicating a ledger. It's quite a coup to get that meme out there: that you could control your own money. Your own information.  You've used that word meme in a few previous interviews. What does it mean to you?  The point is, that I have said publicly many times, that the reason I did ecash was to try to alert the public that they could control their own information. Cryptography. And my hope was that inkling of an idea could be extrapolated and extended to other spheres. Credential magazines or books, at libraries, are simply a generalization of ecash … so we can know who checked out which books – so if you didn't bring them back, you'd have to pay a fee – but your information would remain concealed.  That basic signature, an empowerment, could be generalized. You could show a police officer identification that reveals your age but not your address. That kind of stuff. That meme would parlay and morph if it really caught on. But you know the way things unfold.  NFTs are allowing “meme creators” to perhaps more easily monetize their work. At the same time, definition-wise, memes belong to everyone. It would be a meme if it didn’t spread. Is there something contradictory about taking ownership over ideas?  Controlling information, “owning your own keys” is a meme at the core of the [blockchain] community – but it's not breaking out. A lot of central exchanges defuse it to a certain extent. But maybe a meme is not really going to propagate unless the people you're hoping it will propagate through are somehow impinged upon by its absence. It has to be meaningful, to solve some pain point or provide a new opportunity. I mean, I don't know how else you can explain it because, I mean, the blockchain spaces have done a pretty good job of proving how powerful owning your own keys is. But I don't see people using that concept elsewhere much.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/08/i-jumped-in-with-all-4-legendary-cryptographer-david-chaum-on-the-future-of-web-3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6caae9f97a54c69c0143a2878abe7e01684a8dfc-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415307,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRnbO,1654720533,Market Wrap: Is Bitcoin Breaking Down or Breaking Free?,"Bitcoin (BTC) was sliding back toward the crucial pivot point of $30,000 after a brief rally earlier this week to about $31,700.  The largest cryptocurrency was recently changing hands around $30,100, down 3.1% on the day.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was down 1.4% to $1,788.  Analysts in both crypto and traditional markets were looking ahead at the likely outcome of the European Central Bank's monetary-policy meeting on Thursday. It's possible central banks beyond the U.S. Federal Reserve might start to hold sway over markets. As central banks outside the region start to raise interest rates, theoretically making their fixed-income assets more attractive to yield-seeking investors, they make their currencies more attractive.  That could have implications for bitcoin because its price is usually denominated in dollars, and the trend often coincides with moves in the greenback versus major regional currencies.  ""We're starting to price in much more aggressive tightening by the ECB,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange broker Oanda, said during an appearance on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" show. ""This is going to counter a tremendous amount of dollar strength. The consensus trade is going to be for the dollar to weaken in the second half of the year, not because of what's happening with actions by the Fed, but mainly because of central banks around the world.""  Among altcoins, Chainlink's LINK token has gained 25% over the past five days as the provider of ""oracle networks"" for blockchains on June 7 announced a new roadmap for implementing staking rewards. As of Wednesday, however, the rally appeared to have topped out.  For the latest on blockchain developers' efforts to scale up the Ethereum network with faster and cheaper transactions, check out this piece by CoinDesk's Sam Kessler and Sage D. Young on Danksharding.  In traditional markets, stocks slid as crude oil prices rose above $120 a barrel.

Bitcoin's price link with traditional markets is weakening  For months, bitcoin traded seemingly in lockstep with U.S. stocks – especially technology shares – as more institutional investors nosed into cryptocurrencies. Recently, though, the link appears to have weakened.  Genesis Trading (which is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group) offers some clues on the declining correlation in a monthly report out this week.  Bitcoin's 60-day correlation with the Standard & Poor's 500 Index has declined over the past month, according to the Genesis Trading report. The analysts posited there may not be a ""greater distinction of narratives"" between the asset classes.  ""The market is still dealing with the crypto-specific fallout from the implosion of the Terra ecosystem,"" they wrote. ""Strong tailwinds such as new fund raises, progress on the Ethereum Merge, deeper institutional acceptance and continued application growth could shift sentiment in the other direction, highlighting crypto's relative youth, growth potential and technology angle.""  Whether this is good or bad for bitcoin is an open question. But crypto traders have reason to be optimistic, according to the report, if bitcoin can break free while ""traditional markets grapple with worsening economic conditions and a still-uncertain [interest] rates outlook.""  Altcoin roundup  Ethereum leaps closer to proof-of-stake: The Ethereum blockchain’s first dress rehearsal for its upcoming Merge was successfully completed Wednesday. The Ropsten test network successfully merged its proof-of-work execution layer with the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake consensus chain – a process identical to the one that the main Ethereum network will undergo in just a few months (if all goes well). The much-hyped transition will fundamentally alter the second-largest cryptocurrency, decreasing its energy consumption and constraining the issuance of new ETH tokens, which many expect will boost its price.

New York regulator’s new rules for stablecoins: The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which oversees regulated crypto companies in the state, published its first formal stablecoin-specific guidance. Stablecoins – cryptocurrencies that peg their price to an outside asset, usually to the U.S. dollar – traded in the U.S. state of New York should be fully backed by certain assets, with these assets segregated from the issuers’ operational funds and regularly attested to by an auditor, according to the new guidance. The move comes after the implosion of what was once the third-largest stablecoin, terraUSD (UST), and regulators consequently increasing oversight of the asset class. Read more here.  Citibank says Terra debacle slowed crypto adoption: Volatility in the wake of Terra’s collapse has affected user adoption, Wall Street giant Citibank concluded in its report. The report noted that trading volumes and active addresses spiked around the time luna (LUNC) collapsed, which indicated user adoption, but these increases have since reverted to previous levels or even lower. Cryptocurrencies are notably trading below their peak and mounting concerns about stablecoins exacerbated the decline, according to Citibank. Read more here.

Related Reading | As Bitcoin Slumps, BTC Miners Sell Of Their Tokens Creating Panic In The Market In particular, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols have been severely impacted by the crypto downtrend. Some of the most popular protocols in the Ethereum DeFi sector, perhaps the biggest ecosystem in the space, record as much as 92% in losses. Jack Niewold, founder of Crypto Pragmatist, set out to dig deeper into the effects of the crypto winter in the DeFi sector. One of his objectives was to determine if DeFi protocols can stay profitable in this downtrend. As seen below, protocols like MakerDAO, SushiSwap, Compound, and others saw a decrease in the price of their native tokens and an even more steep decline in their revenue. This evidence put into question the idea that DeFi and crypto, as Niewold said, &apos;really reached an inflection point&apos;. There is evidence of maturity in the space, institutional adoption, and resistance to overall market declines in larger cryptocurrencies.

The Arrington Moonbeam Growth Fund will finance new companies and protocols on the Moonbeam network, aiming at a wide range of verticals, including decentralized finance (DeFi), marketplaces, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and gaming. The fund has already deployed capital to two undisclosed projects.  Moonbeam launched in January and currently has 100 projects that are either live or preparing to launch. In the first five months, Moonbeam users completed over 6.5 million transactions, and developers deployed over 5,000 smart contracts, according to the network.  As an Ethereum-compatible parachain, Moonbeam allows for secure cross-chain interoperability without using bridges. Developers can build native multichain decentralized applications (dapps) and easily port existing smart contracts across blockchains.  Arrington Capital participated in a $1.4 million funding round for Moonbeam in 2020 and a $6 million strategic capital raise last year.  “Moonbeam has gained significant momentum as a new Layer 1 protocol and provides a needed spark for the larger multichain movement, a trend which we are seeing across our portfolio,” Arrington Capital co-founder and partner Michael Arrington said in the press release.  Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch and CrunchBase, along with TechCrunch CEO Heather Harde, founded Arrington Capital in 2017. The venture capital firm also offers the flagship Arrington XRP Capital fund and the $100 million Arrington Algorand Growth Fund.  Last month, the company scrubbed a new $100 million fund from its website that was tied to the Terra yield-generating protocol Anchor, which took major losses due to the crisis-stricken USD stablecoin. Arrington told CoinDesk the removal was due to decreased demand.

42421248,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhsQ1,1654706336,Micah Johnson: From MLB to NFT Superstar,"Shortly after Micah Johnson joined the Los Angeles Dodgers Major League Baseball team, the team’s manager, Dave Roberts, asked all the new members to share their hobbies. Johnson had grown up playing piano but fearing that Roberts “might wheel a piano” into the locker room, he decided to say painting was his hobby instead. Roberts asked him to paint a portrait of Dodgers legend Maury Wills.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sports Week.  “It was terrible,” said Johnson of the painting. “It was so bad. But some of these guys in the locker room were icons I grew up watching … and they came up to me afterwards and told me how good it was.”  That was a turning point for Johnson – the praise from his heroes made him realize, essentially, that his painting skills must not be half bad. Unbeknownst to him at the time, that portrait and his teammates’ reactions planted the seed for his second career as a professional artist.  That career didn’t come about seamlessly. While a player on the Dodgers, Johnson had a few art exhibits at Dodger Stadium and then one in Atlanta. But when he retired from baseball in 2018, he learned that making it as an artist wasn’t going to be easy. “Once I took the jersey off, there wasn't the same allure of this baseball player that's a painter,” he said. “There was nobody lining up to buy my paintings anymore.”  It took until the summer of 2020 for Johnson to get his work back into a gallery after a year and a half of just “grinding.” An admitted workaholic, however, Johnson didn’t let that lag time stop him. He dedicated himself to art just like he’d dedicated himself to baseball when he’d get up at five or six in the morning to “go hit off a tee by myself.”  Read More from Sports Week: DeShone Kizer: From NFL Star to NFT Trailblazer  Johnson’s dedication paid off, but even before he got his work back into galleries, he realized the fruits of his labor when he dipped his toes into the non-fungible token (NFT) art market after learning about the technology via Twitter and Discord. His first NFT, a looping image of a baseball batter receiving a pitch entitled “.15 Seconds,” was purchased in February 2020 for the then-equivalent of around $1,000. “That changed my life,” he said.  Today, Johnson’s the creator of a project that’s gone well beyond art and NFTs – he’s come up with an entire universe with his character Aku, a young boy wearing an astronaut’s helmet. His nephew inspired the character when he asked whether astronauts could be Black. In response to his question, Johnson started painting 6-by-6-foot canvases of his nephew with an astronaut’s helmet on. “I’d FaceTime him and show him these paintings, and the joy on his face to see him himself as this massive painting was fulfilling in a way that the other art I was creating wasn't,” Johnson said.  That vision evolved into the Aku universe, which has spanned a collectible, animated video series, an interactive gallery show at Art Basel Miami and a 15,000-piece NFT profile picture project called Akutars. It was also the first NFT, Johnson said, to be optioned for TV and film all the way back in April 2021. Celebrities including Trevor Noah, Pusha T and Tyra Banks have all bought in, leading to millions of dollars in sales.  Still, Johnson’s success hasn’t come without significant setbacks. In April, due to problems with the Akutars’ smart contract, Johnson lost $34 million worth of ETH. He’s surprisingly levelheaded about the fallout. “As a non-technical founder, you have to navigate things that are out of your scope,” he said. “I paid 22 and a half million dollars out of my pocket to reimburse the refunds and make everybody right and deliver the Akutars.”  Read More: NHL Partners With Sweet to Offer Digital Collectibles, NFTs  And it’s not hindering his vision. The loss didn’t stop Aku-related productions. Johnson is still working to “blend the physical and digital world” with Aku. He still has dreams of creating an Aku-themed amusement park. And more importantly, he doesn’t want Aku to be about NFTs – he wants the technology simply to serve as the backend for a bigger picture, a project that inspires all types of people to follow their dreams and be what they want to be – not just his nephew.  CoinDesk spoke with Johnson about these ambitious plans for his project, how he’s launched this fictional astronaut character into actual space and what parts of himself he sees in Aku.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Jessica Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/08/micah-johnson-from-mlb-to-nft-superstar,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4e5a5c57670d57fa2dfb3fc7947ea9fd9ab540cf-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Instead, he predicts a combination of market bottoms, ups-and-downs and sideways movement until a “new narrative emerges” on the macro economic environment and interest rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve increasing interest rates to lower inflation is causing hiccups and unpredictability in economic models, he said, adding that he’s “preparing for kind of a longer battle.”  Of approximately 1,900 crypto-focused hedge funds, Novogratz estimates two-thirds could go out of business.  Even so, Novogratz said he will continue to hire people and isn’t seeing a shortage of talent or excitement in crypto. Galaxy is in a “really good position to build through this downturn,” he said.  “Why I'm still hiring people and optimistic is I see the adoption [of crypto] in real life” and in real applications, Novogratz said. In addition, Galaxy is continuing to sign up more investors.  On the collapse of Terra’s UST stablecoin, Novogratz said the key lesson is to not put all of your eggs in one basket and have proper risk-management protocols. It's also prudent to take some chips off the table along the way, he said.

42415305,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRnYs,1654704131,CFTC Chief Heaps Praise on Bill That Boosts Agency’s Crypto Reach,"Rostin Behnam, the chief of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, likes what he sees from a new bill from U.S. senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand that would establish his agency as a significant crypto regulator in the U.S.  “It does a very good job,” Behnam said Wednesday at a cryptocurrency event hosted by the Washington Post. “One of the trickiest things we’re going to have to do – and I think they address this very well – is deciphering between a commodity and security.”  Behnam said the legislation, a potential foundation for industry oversight introduced this week, “would give the CFTC authority to write rules and regulate these stakeholders.” And because it also sets up industry fees that would directly fund the agency, he said it would allow bringing on more people “so we can regulate the market in the right way.”  Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), also speaking at the Washington event, were quick to point out that the Securities and Exchange Commission – which has been perceived by the cryptocurrency industry as being more adversarial than the CFTC – is also given a major role and a new system of disclosures.  “The SEC has an enormous responsibility,” Gillibrand said, referencing the vast number of smaller tokens likely to be defined as securities. “We aren’t minimizing the role of the SEC.”  While the CFTC may oversee the most market share, because it would have authority over the trading of the largest cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the SEC would have the “sheer numbers,” Lummis said, including the crypto efforts she said would “be the larger perpetrators of fraud.”  Lummis met with SEC Chair Gary Gensler this week, and she said he hadn’t yet read the bill but has been asked for his feedback. The Wyoming senator suggested this legislation represents a “working draft” and is open for revision. Supporters and critics have already begun weighing in on the effort, which could extend well into next year and beyond.  Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz called the bill “wildly positive,” adding the senators deserve “three cheers.”  “It's shocking how many Democratic politicians I now have in the office getting up to speed” and trying to determine the right stance on the crypto industry, Novogratz said at a Piper Sandler conference on Wednesday.

The Ropsten test network (testnet) successfully merged its proof-of-work execution layer with the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake consensus chain – a process identical to the one that the main Ethereum network will undergo in just a few months (if all goes well).  The Merge is a long-awaited milestone in Ethereum’s journey toward a new proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Currently, Ethereum depends on proof-of-work (PoW), whereby miners expend energy to discover new blocks and add them to the blockchain, earning newly issued ether (ETH) and a portion of the transaction fees and tips. Once Ethereum shifts from PoW to PoS, validators who have staked the required 32 ETH will take over the role of adding new blocks to the blockchain.  Read more: Everything You Need to Know About Ethereum 2.0  Currently, the Beacon Chain runs in parallel with the current PoW chain. The Beacon Chain is the PoS coordination chain that already has validators creating and validating new blocks in tandem with the PoW execution chain. Once the PoS chain has been adequately tested and secured, the two chains will merge and Ethereum will continue as a PoS blockchain.  The complexity of such a change to Ethereum’s code requires multiple tests on various testnets. Ropsten’s merge is the first test of its kind, and its outcome will help to inform developers’ future steps as they proceed toward the real Merge on mainnet.  Other testnet merges on Goerli and Seoplia are expected to happen in the coming months.  Read more: Merge Testing on Ethereum: What Is It and Why Does It Matter?

42394196,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZgad,1654703296,Will El Salvador Default on Its Sovereign Debt in 2023?,"Owing to El Salvador's $800 million sovereign bond due in January 2023 and an implied default probability of 48%, international financial markets think there’s about an even chance that the Central American country stops scheduled repayments in eight months, just over a year after adopting bitcoin as legal tender.  El Salvador has stubbornly low economic growth, a wide fiscal deficit and almost 90% of GDP in expensive government debt (costing 5% per year compared with 1.5% in the U.S.). Without major changes in economic policy, the country risks a dangerous sovereign default.  Frank Muci is a fellow at LSE’s School of Public Policy. His research interests include economic growth policy and public financial management. A longer version of this piece first appeared in Frank Muci’s newsletter.  Most practitioners and academics agree that sovereign default has major costs. This is especially true in dollarized countries like El Salvador, where missed payments by the government could trigger a bank run. As in other emerging markets, local banks, insurance companies and pension funds in El Salvador all have a lot of domestic government debt and some foreign government debt on their balance sheets.  Even if President Nayib Bukele’s government only defaulted on the country’s foreign debt, the domestic debt would become riskier (and less valuable), causing mark-to-market paper losses across both types of bonds that would eat into bank equity cushions and impair balance sheets across the financial system.  Read more: El Salvador Postpones Bitcoin Bond: Report  In this scenario, a large minority of Salvadorans might want to park their dollars in physical cash or safe U.S. banks, not in relatively riskier banks at home. Large cash withdrawals or outflows to the U.S. could strain domestic bank liquidity and potentially tip weaker banks into insolvency. El Salvador’s monetary authority can’t print U.S. dollars to calm a panic or rescue failing institutions (only the U.S. Federal Reserve can), so the central bank would have to use its limited reserves worth $3.4 billion ​– or 12% of the country’s GDP​​ – to manage the stress.  Read more: Six of 10 Salvadorans Quit Using the Chivo Wallet After Getting the Bitcoin Incentive, Study Finds  Given the risks and costs of sovereign default, it makes sense that El Salvador wants to keep paying. The government appears eager to keep serving the debt, at least for now. In March, El Salvador Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya insisted the country’s default risk “is zero” and said that the government remains committed to paying in all scenarios.  For one, Bukele is looking to get re-elected in two years, in June 2024, and govern for another five years after that. His approval ratings are extremely high (85%) and his control over the media and legal system is tightening, virtually guaranteeing a victory at the polls.  The options  Bukele’s administration issued more than a quarter of all foreign bonds, selling $1.1 billion of notes in 2019 and $1 billion in 2020. If Bukele starts running out of money and has to default, he could do so in 2025, when another major $800 million bond is due. But for now, at least El Salvador can probably keep paying.  If not, Bukele could just get a program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and raise hundreds of millions of dollars in cheap financing to fund the government, which the IMF would gradually disburse in exchange for reforms.  The IMF would probably ask for fiscal consolidation – tax hikes and spending cuts – so the debt/GDP ratio trends downward in the medium run. It would also require a crypto reform, amending the bitcoin law to contain macro risks. This is all doable – because of Bukele's popularity and his large majority in Congress. Plus, it's his heavy-handed security policy that has made him extremely popular, not the bitcoin law, which could be changed with limited political repercussions.  More speculatively, El Salvador might be able to secure some financing from large players in the crypto space, the so-called “whales” who want to keep the idea of ""nation-state bitcoin adoption"" alive. Stablecoin issuer Tether, crypto exchange Bitfinex or others could extend support with a direct loan to the government, by buying domestic bonds or simply depositing U.S. dollars in banks in El Salvador, which the banks could turn around and use to buy government debt.  For now, the country has options. They're not great options, but they’re options. All this leads me to conclude that El Salvador probably won’t default in 2023.

42415293,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRnRK,1654700749,Neal Stephenson Coined ‘Metaverse’ in 1992. Now He’s Building One,"In 1992, science-fiction author Neal Stephenson coined the term “metaverse” in his hit novel “Snow Crash.” Now, 30 years later, he’s teaming up with another crypto OG, Peter Vessenes, to bring his vision to life.  The duo announced Wednesday they’re creating their own metaverse-focused blockchain called Lamina1. Vessenes will be the project’s CEO while Stephenson will serve as chairman.  Like the visions of the metaverse popularized in the summer of 2021, before much of the corporate world began co-opting the term, Lamina1 will be centered on open metaverses with a focus on virtual- and augmented-reality integrations.  “The Facebook name change was a big milestone for the metaverse, although the idea had been building for some time before that,” Stephenson told CoinDesk in an interview, adding:  “While big companies like Microsoft [MSFT] became interested, what also happened was lots of smaller players became interested, too. There are a lot of people who want to get in on the metaverse and build their dreams, build their ideas, realize their creative notions or their commercial ambitions.”  The testnet and betanet of Lamina1 are scheduled to be launched later this year, with the ultimate goal being to create an immersive 3D metaverse inspired by the novel itself.  Plans for Lamina1  Vessenes told CoinDesk the first iteration of the blockchain will be “somewhere between a friendly fork and partnership” of Avalanche, though no plans have been finalized.  Financial backers of the project include Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, Geoff Entress, Matthew Roszak, Patrick Murck and David Johnston, according to a press release.  The announcement comes at a time when the metaverse continues to mean anything from a blockchain-based video game to an immersive future of life itself.  Investors are hedging their bets on both ends of the spectrum, backing projects that range from centralized virtual marketplaces like the one Meta is building to projects like MetaMetaverse, whose ambitions resonate more with the crypto-native.  “When I look at the things that have made the top chains work, it’s really just how successful they’ve been at getting their communities all the resources they need, and just helping them succeed,” Vessenes told CoinDesk. “What we’re wanting to do is bring in very, very high-quality IP partners, enterprise partners, help everybody meet each other and just build cool stuff.”  Stephenson will be speaking at CoinDesk’s Consensus conference in Austin, Texas, later this week.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SPONSORED,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/08/neal-stephenson-coined-metaverse-in-1992-now-hes-building-one,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6abc6ed4263f3c57fdd110fd2be193463bee0d5d-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It initiated coverage of the Nasdaq-traded stock with a buy rating and a $9 price target.  The Beijing-based company is a play on any rebound in the price of BTC as product demand is highly correlated with the price of the cryptocurrency, the broker said. Miners earn rewards in BTC, which impacts the return on investment on mining machines and influences demand and profitability.  Canaan is well-positioned for a cyclical rebound with a robust $400 million in cash and a new mining initiative, Benchmark said. The current $100 million stock buyback will help support the stock through the “current crypto winter,” it added.  The broker is positive in its long-term view of the crypto industry. While Canaan’s operations will fluctuate along with BTC, Benchmark says, “bitcoin is here to stay and long-term trends are favorable.”  Risks to the investment case include the threat of new crypto regulations, the volatility of BTC, China-U.S. relations, and continued COVID pressures, the report added.

While there are other cards that allow users to spend crypto by converting it into fiat currency when paying out merchants, the Edge Mastercard is likely the first card not to require any personal identification data.  The Edge Mastercard supports bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), dogecoin (DOGE), litecoin (LTC) and dash (DASH), but is only accessible to U.S. customers at launch, according to a Wednesday press release.  Users do not have to pay any fees for the card, which has a daily limit of $1,000 and also supports online payment.  The card can be used at any of the 10 million merchants across the U.S. that are on Mastercard's (MA) open-loop network. Users can input any name under the ""billing address"" fields, as long as it agrees with the shipping address, the statement said.  The card uses technology by Ionia, a fintech and payments startup, and is issued by Patriot Bank N.A.  Edge Mastercard is ""in compliance with all requirements for issuers, card associations, regulations, local, federal and international laws,"" according to the press release.  Founded in 2014 as Airbitz, Edge is a self-custody digital assets exchange with $2.5 million in funding, according to startup information platform Crunchbase.  After the announcement Mastercard's director of global communications Katie Priebe said in an e-mail, ""there is no such program approved or in market today.""  ""This card program is being administered via the Mastercard template card program by Patriot Bank. The templated program only needs to be approved by the card issuer,"" Joelly Gloria of Edge's Marketing team said.

""Edge is not using the full, custom program at this time, but is using the templated program...this is likely the cause of confusion, as that custom program application is currently pending, ""she added, noting that the item that has not been approved is the custom designed card that we intend to have.

42394204,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZhFf,1654695593,"As Federal Agencies Organize, US States Continue to Lead in Regulating Digital Assets","On March 9, 2022, the Biden administration issued a much anticipated executive order regarding digital assets, which called for “the first-ever, whole-of-government approach to addressing the risks and harnessing the potential benefits of digital assets and their underlying technology.”  While its reception has been mixed, one comment – from New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Deputy Superintendent Dan Sangeap on LinkedIn – raised an interesting question: After almost eight years of letting states craft their own crypto policies, “what’s the rush” at the federal level?  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  An NYDFS deputy superintendent highlighting New York’s virtual currency framework is not in itself surprising. What is surprising is how it mirrored congressional republicans pointing to New York cryptocurrency regulation as an example of how the federal government is lagging behind the states.  Specifically, during the U.S. House of Representatives’ hearing on the president’s Working Group’s Report on Stablecoins, Rep. Warren Davidson, a Republican congressman from Ohio, referenced that the NYDFS had already been regulating stablecoins for years, and that the federal government was “seven years late.”  Indeed, many of the state money transmission laws provide a regulatory licensing framework for stablecoins. Although the Biden administration is attempting a “whole-of government” approach, it’s likely that states, in both the short and long term, will continue to play an active role in regulating the global crypto industry.  Even with the March 9, 2022, executive order, several crypto industry leaders still believe congressial action, perhaps needed, ""won’t be happening soon.” This pessimism also extends to the recently unveiled Responsible Financial Innovation Act, which is already considered merely “a starting point for a dialogue.”  See also: Biden's Executive Order on Crypto Receives Bipartisan Praise  While anecdotal, these comments underscore the vital role the states play in regulating the cryptocurrency space. The importance of state regulation has grown not only due perceived policy reversals at the federal level (e.g., a top national banking regulator putting the brakes on new crypto charters for a period of time), but also a general lack of cohesive federal action.  This is not to say that federal agencies have been inactive in the cryptocurrency space, and in fact some agencies – such as the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) – were early pioneers in applying anti-money laundering requirements to digital asset service providers.  However, the lack of coordination among federal regulatory agencies has contributed to the increased importance of state prudential regulation, and innovation is happening below the federal level. For example, California Governor Gavin Newsom recently issued an executive order for state agencies to establish regulations tailored to digital assets, and the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation followed shortly thereafter with an invitation for public and stakeholder comments regarding a regulatory regime in development.  With this in mind, those interested in innovation should look not only to federal efforts but also to the states, primarily New York, Wyoming and Florida.  New York  New York is arguably the most prolific crypto regulator, if for longevity alone. The NYDFS has been overseeing New York’s cryptocurrency market for seven years, having been tasked with regulating virtual currency in 2015. In addition, the NYDFS has been credited with being the first to have a comprehensive licensing and regulatory regime in the U.S. tailored to virtual currency activity – often called the ""BitLicense.""  In these seven years, the BitLicense has drawn more than its fair share of criticism, with some crypto entities even fleeing New York to in protest. With that said, others have touted NYDFS as being “pivotal in bringing fresh money into the crypto space through regulatory approvals.”  Independent of its supporters and detractors, the BitLicense regime has stood firm and appears to be stronger than ever.  In fact, not only has the New York State legislature recently authorized NYDFS to “assess” virtual currency firms – which should aid NYDFS in further growing the virtual currency unit – but “more money and jobs are still flowing into New York than any other city, making it the de facto crypto capital of the U.S.”  See also: Kill the BitLicense | Opinion  Moreover, NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne Harris has stated that improving the BitLicense is one of her top priorities, and she has not only already hired additional staff this year to help streamline the process, but she also plans to triple the size of the virtual currency unit by the end of the year.  Wyoming  While New York may have longevity and institutional prestige, Wyoming has been trying to establish itself as a leader in the crypto space.  The Wyoming State legislature has enacted multiple blockchain-related laws, including a legal framework for recognizing decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). Most notably, Wyoming created a new type of charter, the Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI), to “focus on digital assets, such as virtual currencies, digital securities and digital consumer assets.” According to Wyoming, four SPDI charters have already been approved.  It is unclear, however, if these four SPDIs have begun operating. Specifically, there have been reports that none of the four approved SPDIs have yet received the necessary certificates of authority to operate. It would appear that this is still the case, based on information from each entity’s website.  Florida  Like Wyoming, Florida has been trying to position itself as the next cryptocurrency – and financial – capital of the U.S. So much so that, in a not-so-subtle jab at the iconic Wall Street Bull, Miami Mayor Francis X. Suarez unveiled “The Miami Bull” at Bitcoin 2022. While much has been said about the Miami Bull, more should be said about the steps Florida is taking to make itself more crypto friendly, most noticeably legislation to remedy the Espinoza problem.  For reference, the Espinoza problem refers to State v. Espinoza, a 2019 Florida court ruling which held that any two-party transaction involving cryptocurrency in Florida would require the seller to have a money transmitter license.  Some have painted efforts to reform Espinoza as being sponsored by the industry, but such criticisms minimize the inconsistencies that Espinoza created. The Espinoza holding rendered Florida an outlier, with most states requiring licensure where a third party intermediary is also present.  It is for this reason that Espinoza has been panned by the industry, as well as by the commissioner of the very agency responsible for enforcing Espinoza, Florida’s Office of Financial Regulation. In response to industry concerns, legislation was recently passed by the Florida State legislature, and signed by the governor, which creates a legal distinction between two parties buying, selling or trading cryptocurrencies versus transactions facilitated through an intermediary. The changes will become effective on Jan. 1, 2023.  States-led is good  The push by states to fill the regulatory vacuum has not been without criticism. A common refrain is that the patchwork of state regulation makes compliance efforts cumbersome. A more recent complaint is that states have become unknowing, or willful, stooges for the crypto industry. What these criticisms miss are the potential benefits that state regulation brings.  State regulation can bring further clarity and on a large scale, can even provide some measure of uniformity. With each additional state that issues guidance or no-action letters stating when virtual currency activity is – or is not – regulated as money transmission, industry participants are provided further clarity.  Moreover, as certain approaches to regulation gain traction among the states, an organic type of uniformity can develop across the patchwork, ultimately bringing certain outliers back into the fold (e.g., Florida joining other states in regulating crypto activity as money transmission only when there is a third party intermediary present).  The patchwork of state regulation can also serve as a source of “healthy and protective regulatory redundancy.” While redundancy is not often viewed in a positive light, one can posit that the presence of numerous regulators can better absorb the shocks posed by partisan administration changes when compared with their federal counterparts.  Here to stay  Furthermore, there are several signs suggesting that state regulators will continue to play a key role in cryptocurrency regulation. While the federal government has tended to neglect state regulation in the past, in its April 7, 2022 alert, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation urged its regulated entities to also notify state regulators of their crypto-related activity.  See also: Why the Crypto Executive Order Is a Historical Milestone  Sen. Pat Toomey’s Stablecoin TRUST Act also mentions state regulators and “[p]reserves the state-registered money transmitter status for most existing stablecoin issuers.” And from the private sector, Paxos – one of three entities granted a National Trust Bank charter by the OCC for cryptocurrency-related activities – has publicly stated that it has no intention of abandoning its New York charter.  Only time will tell if the Biden admin’s “whole of government” approach to virtual currency regulation is successful.

The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which oversees regulated crypto companies in the state, published its first stablecoin-specific guidance Wednesday, listing a series of requirements that any issuer operating in the state must abide by.  The idea behind the guidance is to formalize both consumer protection and institutional soundness, NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne Harris told CoinDesk in an interview.  “As we think about stablecoins and this guidance, and this is something we have been working on before the events of last month, really our goal is to accomplish those things for the stablecoin market, the safety and soundness of institutions, stability of the marketplace and consumer protection,” she said.  For stablecoins, this includes ensuring liquidity for redemptions, she said.  According to NYDFS’s guidance, stablecoins, the value of which is intended to be pegged to the U.S. dollar or other assets, must be backed by a reserve composed of U.S. Treasury bills with no more than three months to maturity, U.S. Treasury notes, some types of U.S. Treasury bonds or reverse repurchase agreements that are collateralized by Treasury bills.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/08/new-yorks-crypto-regulator-publishes-formal-stablecoin-guidance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1fbb57b43d3523e5fa239fc24b4781cad82e1ff-1024x649.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42415310,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRnce,1654694985,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Recaptures $30K as Crypto Analysts Warn of Capitulation,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off.)  Price point: Bitcoin recaptures $30K, though analysts warn that further declines may lie ahead.  Market Moves: The Wall Street giant Citigroup warns that last month's collapse of Terra's LUNA token and UST ""algorithmic stablecoin"" may have delayed cryptocurrency adoption, Will Canny reports.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) climbed back above $30,000, a key pivot point, but the price appeared to be slipping in early U.S. trading hours.  Cryptocurrencies were still broadly higher on Wednesday versus 24 hours earlier, with Chainlink's LINK jumping 14% and Cardano's ADA up 11%.  The gains came even as traditional markets struggled, with investor fears rising over ongoing efforts by central banks globally to tighten monetary policy – to contain soaring inflation.  Bitcoin's (BTC) price has tumbled 34% this year as Federal Reserve reserve rate increases and balance-sheet shrinkage have reduced excess liquidity in financial markets.  The European Central Bank (ECB), led by President Christine Lagarde, is scheduled to meet Thursday and is expected to convey its own plans for tightening monetary policy. Money markets are pricing in 1.25 percentage points of ECB interest-rate increases over the rest of 2022, according to the German lender Deutsche Bank.  ""Many crypto traders are still nervous about one last plunge,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda, wrote Tuesday.  The analysis firm Glassnode warned Tuesday that a ""full-scale capitulation scenario"" could occur at a BTC price range from $20,560 to $23,600. Blockchain data suggests that bitcoin miners are liquidating some of their holdings in response to a squeeze on profits.  ""The highest probability is that the market is within the second and historically final capitulation phase of a bitcoin bear market,"" they wrote.  Market moves  The giant U.S. bank Citigroup argues in a new research piece that a slowdown in crypto adoption might be one of the biggest consequences from Terra's collapse, Will Canny reports for CoinDesk.  Last month's price crash in Terra's LUNA tokens (since renamed LUNC) and the crash of the ""algorithmic stablecoin"" UST below its $1 peg wiped out at least $40 billion of market value.  According to Citi, nagging concerns about stablecoins generally have led to outflows from Tether's USDT. (Fitch Ratings estimated Tuesday that the market capitalization of all stablecoins shrank to $162 billion at the end of May from $188 billion at the end of March.)  Such concerns have most likely compounded declines in crypto markets, the report said.  According to Citi, “tentative evidence suggests a reduction in trading volumes and futures positions but not wholesale declines in investor interest in the space.""  “Volatility has affected user adoption,” the Wall Street giant said.

The bug was brought to light by a community member on the Osmosis subreddit, although the post was deleted by the forum's moderator.  The exploit came to light when a user deposited funds to a liquidity pool before instantly withdrawing it. The value of the withdrawal was unintentionally 50% higher than the deposit.  The team took 12 minutes to halt the chain after the exploit had emerged, according to a Discord post by Osmosis community analyst, RoboMcGobo.  In an update on Twitter, Osmosis wrote: ""Liquidity pools were NOT 'completely drained.' Devs are fixing the bug, scoping the size of losses (likely in the range of ~$5M), and working on recovery.""

42394200,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZgv9,1654693239,"Lunarpunks, Privacy and the New Encryption Guerillas","In 1916, a few hundred revolutionaries declared Ireland to be an autonomous nation and occupied strategic locations around Dublin. In the days that followed, the British Army encircled the uprising and suffocated it.  One by one, the leaders of the uprising were lined up and shot. A young fighter named Michael Collins evaded death by chance. He vowed never to enter into direct clashes with the British Empire again, and began a war that would change the shape of resistance forever.  This article is part of Road to Consensus. Rachel-Rose O'Leary will speak at Layer 2's ""Big Ideas"" stage at Consensus.  Units were split into small groups that operated in secrecy. Fighters lacked weapons, but the people and rugged landscape protected them. The new warfare favored hit-and-run tactics and disrupting enemy intelligence. It was the dawn of modern guerrilla tactics – and it won Ireland its independence.  These guerilla tactics are no longer feasible today. Modern surveillance technologies and automated weaponry have turned the world that we inhabit into a desert with no protective cover. Resistance fighters are easy targets.  Since the 1990s, a movement of privacy advocates and coders called cypherpunks have been fighting back the encroachment of surveillance. In some sense, they draw inspiration from the guerilla fighters before them.  Guerilla warfare is fundamentally asymmetric: It is the tactic of a smaller, disadvantaged people against a vastly superior enemy. They fight high-tech with low-tech, complexity with simplicity, fire with water.  See also: We Have Entered the Age of Anonymous Crypto | Opinion  Coders and guerillas alike define the front lines and change them constantly. For cyphers, it's with ever-advancing encryption and for fighters like the Irish, it's the ability to melt back into the community before the enemy can even give chase.  As governments build all-encompassing surveillance machines, cypherpunks use simple encryption tools to render them futile. Cypherpunks argue that without privacy, personal liberty is impossible. Cryptography is a defensive tool to live free from coercion and force.  The new guerillas  Lunarpunk is descended from cypherpunk but takes its logic a step further. It’s a guerrilla movement committed to establishing a digital forest in cypherspace using tools like encryption that its fighters can recede into.  The current internet is a desert rather than a forest due to surveillance. Lunarpunks defend and define new territories – dark, fertile zones that have been claimed back using private, anonymous decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and peer-to-peer (P2P) organizational tooling. Another word for this would be an agora, or non-state system.  In an interesting twist of history, a science-fiction subculture called solarpunk was one of the principal inspirations for Ether Both lunarpunk and solarpunk are utopian. Unlike solarpunk, lunarpunk is armed. It runs on DarkFi.  Currently in the devnet phase, DarkFi (the word is a combination of ""dark"" and ""DeFi"") is a layer 1 blockchain that supports these private and anonymous applications. Lunarpunks, so far a small movement of hackers, are already creating tools using DarkFi that allow communities to coordinate in the dark.  The DarkFi community has been working on an initial design for a private and anonymous DAO. Right now, DarkFi coders are testing a P2P Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client and task manager to ensure DAOs on DarkFi do not become dependent on centralized and proprietary software. Although crypto aims for decentralization, so much of the industry’s activity happens over for-profit tools like the messaging app Discord and digital notebook Notion.  Until now, blockchain applications have been built on a desert landscape. Killer apps like automated market makers (AMM) compute the price of assets in token pools and require the app to know everything that happens in real time. The dominant engineering paradigm requires total surveillance.  To engineer anonymous applications, we must generate new concepts. It is necessary to evolve what the DarkFi community calls ""anonymous engineering"" – a new kind of engineering based on hidden information.  For example, zero-knowledge cryptography unlocks a new set of techniques – you can make encrypted commitments to data and trustlessly prove whether or not something has happened. You can compose hidden data structures that can hold references to one another. You can combine these techniques with other primitives, such as homomorphic encryption and multiparty computation, to design fully anonymous and featured applications.  Inverting power  Lunarpunks perceive lightness as terror, and are fighting against surveillance capitalism. In DarkFi, darkness is structured as an inversion of contemporary power dynamics and a way to empower communities. Darkness is the legacy of surveillance turned upside down.  The inversion of hierarchies has been central to many crypto-anarchist movements. Think of the parallel, inverted world that crypto-anarchists call the Parallel Polis, or the tactic of counter-economics, a black market economy that exists parallel to, but distinct from, the statist economy.  You can trace this political symbol to the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who wrote about what he called active and reactive forces. Forces are energies that drive human behavior. For him, active forces were positive – and are seen when people affirm and assert their power.  Further, active forces lead to differentiation – a multiplicity of cults, factions and communities expressing power in different ways. Reactive forces suppress power and deny difference.  In the lunarpunk's language, forests are active and deserts are reactive. Resistance is active; oppression is reactive.  According to Nietzsche, active forces should dominate reactive forces. He called this “hierarchy.” But he argues that in reality, perhaps contrary to what you might expect, hierarchies are often inverted. Reactive forces, though lethargic and without any original ideas, are often the most powerful. State power persists by repressing resistance. The desert dominates.  See also: Lunarpunk, Black Markets, and Agorism in the 21st Century | Opinion  Lunarpunk does not negate the current order: It inverts the false hierarchy that places reactive forces on high and suppresses active forces. Lunarpunk proclaims the victory of affirmation against negation, the victory of the active against the reactive, and the victory of the forests against the desert.  Like flowers bursting from concrete, a new design space is emerging from dead-end surveillance optimization. It is effortless and spontaneous, like a miracle of healing breaking out across a scarred and broken landscape.  Encryption is asymmetric: It favors the smaller player over the monopoly. Cypherpunk hero Julian Assange said that ""the universe smiles on encryption"" because it is easier to encrypt information than to decrypt it. Lunarpunks are wielding this mystical quality of the universe in open conflict with surveillance.

Nashville, Tenn.-based Valkyrie offers eight protocol trusts, a decentralized finance (DeFi) hedge fund, three Nasdaq-listed exchange-traded funds (ETF) and a protocol treasury management business. Last month, Valkyrie’s XBTO Bitcoin Futures Fund won approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  “We really weren’t anticipating raising any capital right now,” Valkyrie co-founder and Chief Investment Officer Steven McClurg told CoinDesk in an interview, noting that the firm initially declined investment offers. “It was a little bit less about the money and more about the strategic partnerships.”  Other participants in the funding included merchant bank SenaHill Partners, venture capital fund Belvedere Strategic Capital and ClearSky, one of the largest hedge funds for carbon credits. Valkyrie also expanded its global partnerships with the participation of Singapore-based Zilliqa Capital (ZIL) and Taiwan-based C-Squared Ventures.  The fresh capital will help Valkyrie continue to build out its technology infrastructure in the hopes of bringing more institutional investors into the digital asset space. The company will also invest in staking and mining tools, said McClurg, because Valkyrie runs the master nodes and validators for many of its funds. McClurg noted existing third-party staking services don’t offer the necessary institutional-grade reporting.

42393834,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBcM5,1654687800,Scaling Ethereum Beyond the Merge: Danksharding,"We’ve talked in past editions of this newsletter about how Ethereum’s roadmap initially planned to ship “sharding” alongside its switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. While PoS would have decreased the network’s energy costs, sharding would have been welcomed by users annoyed by Ethereum’s slow transactions and high fees.  The plan was called “Ethereum 2.0,” but it, along with the Eth2 moniker, have been retired in favor of a new, “rollup-centric roadmap.“  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  This week, strap in for a slightly more technical summary of one of the more exciting developments currently slated to follow The Merge: Danksharding. As it's currently formulated, Danksharding would take a massive step towards making Ethereum layer 2 networks like Optimism, Arbitrum and zkSync into first class citizens. Layer 2 networks are companion systems designed to help a cryptocurrency system handle a larger volume of data.  Why rollups?  Sharding was proposed over five years ago as a way to help the network scale by splitting activity across several different chains. Like adding lanes to a highway, splitting the Ethereum network into “shards” was proposed as a way to increase the amount of activity Ethereum could process, thereby decreasing fees and improving transaction speeds.  Read more: Ethereum’s Rollups Aren’t All Built the Same  Although Ethereum’s developers generally agree that sharding is an important next step for the network, there are lots of competing ideas on how it should work. As a result, the would-be major update to Ethereum has proven difficult to implement.  While sharding has been stuck in development hell, a handful of third parties have seized the Eth-scaling mantle.  Some of these solutions are basically just glorified sidechains – independent blockchains that can send and receive Ethereum network transactions. As an example — users can “bridge” Token A to a sidechain, swap it for Token B (quickly and cheaply), and then “bridge” Token B back to Ethereum. A series of transactions that costs thousands of dollars on Ethereum can be done for pennies on Polygon, Ronin or Gnosis. Since the transactions are taking place on the sidechain, they help keep some network traffic off of Ethereum (higher traffic on Ethereum means higher fees for everyone).  Of course, this convenience often comes at a cost. While easy to spin up and use, sidechains tend to make compromises to centralization and security in the name of convenience.  Compared to sidechains, layer 2 rollups are considered by many developers to be the more secure way for Ethereum to scale. Rollups, like sidechains, take the stress off of Ethereum by executing transactions on a separate blockchain. Transactions are “settled” on the rollup chain, bundled up, and then “posted” to Ethereum. Unlike sidechains, rollups borrow their security from the Ethereum mainnet – they use fancy cryptography and other methods (like a multi-day dispute period) to allow Ethereum mainnet nodes to confirm that transactions are legitimate.  (Compare this to a sidechain – which just passes data back down to Ethereum network with little more than a pinky-promise that the data is true. If a sidechain gets exploited, in other words, Ethereum is none the wiser.)  As sharding has proven difficult to implement, rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism have picked up the scaling slack. These and other rollups are already enabling users to make certain kinds of transactions on Ethereum quickly and inexpensively, without sacrificing security.  Mind you, the Ethereum mainnet remains as slow and expensive as ever. With these layer 2 networks set to handle the brunt of Ethereum’s activity moving forward, sharding has become less of a priority for Ethereum’s developers, who have shifted toward a new “rollup-centric” roadmap.  Read more: How Ethereum Will Be Transformed in 2022  Danksharding and EIP 4844  The idea of sharding hasn’t been put to bed yet. Enter Danksharding, proto-danksharding and EIP 4844.  Danksharding is the current design proposal for sharding on Ethereum. Named for Dankrad Feist, the Ethereum researcher who initially proposed it, Danksharding is sharding for a rollup-centric age.  What follows is a high-level summary of a topic that’s sure to earn more attention once the Merge finally comes to pass. Rather than explain these topics in depth (which can get super technical), the hope here is to place them into a broader context.  Way back in 2016, before sharding was deprioritized, shards were theorized as a way to increase the total number of transactions Ethereum could process. Danksharding takes this same principle of splitting network activity into shards, but instead of using the shards to increase transaction throughput, it uses them to increase space for “blobs” of data.  Danksharding works using “data availability sampling,” a technique that allows nodes on Ethereum to verify large amounts of data just by sampling a few pieces of it. In essence, it allows Ethereum to process larger quantities of data than it could previously. (A great breakdown of how this all works is in the incredibly informative – and thorough – ""Hitchhikers Guide to Ethereum,"" recently published by Delphi Digital).  As Medium poster Polynya summarized back in January, “Danksharding turns Ethereum into a unified settlement and data availability layer.” Transacting directly on Ethereum will still be possible, but Danksharding will pave the way toward a future when vastly cheaper (and quicker) layer 2 networks can thrive. These networks – which bundle up transactions before posting them back to Ethereum – will benefit the most from an increase to the amount of data that can be posted to the chain.  Danksharding, like the rest of sharding, is complicated. There are still plenty of kinks to work out and design decisions to be made before it will be ready to hit Ethereum’s mainnet. In the meantime, proto-danksharding is being proposed as a key first step towards Danksharding.  Proto-dansharding will come with Ethereum improvement proposal 4844 (EIP-4844), whose authors include Dankrad Feist and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. The proposal involves adding a new transaction type to Ethereum: the “blob-carrying transaction.”  As Feist and Buterin explained in a recent Bankless podcast interview, Ethereum blocks can currently carry 50-100 kb of data, but under proto-danksharding they’ll be able to carry closer to 1 mb. While this is less than the 16 mb that is projected under full Danksharding (all of that fancy data availability sampling isn’t ready yet), a 10x increase in data availability should significantly decrease the cost of using rollups.  Danksharding is still a long ways out, but proto-danksharding is already being prototyped.

WHY IT MATTERS: DEXs serve as a self-custodial, programmatic way for cryptocurrency investors to trade without an intermediary. From April 2021 to April 2022, $224 billion was sent to DEXs through smart contracts on-chain compared to the $175 billion sent to CEXs. The volume of on-chain transactions on DEXs demonstrates how DEXs are a viable alternative to DEXs.

Is this the explanation for the Terra/ LUNA collapse? Was this whole situation not a deliberate attack? Were natural market forces responsible instead?

Data has become a valuable resource in the digital universe, whether that’s aggregated data from people’s retail decisions or self-driven miles accumulated by the auto industry’s AI-enabled cars. However, the raw data sets needed to model outcomes or train machine-learning algorithms have tended to accumulate in the hands of a few very large companies – a situation Ocean aims to democratize for a Web 3 future.  Ocean’s version 3, released in late 2020, allowed particular data sets, the supply-chain data of a large company, for example, to be accessed using Ethereum-based “data tokens” that would enable the data to be shared and also monetized in decentralized data marketplaces. Version 4 of the protocol uses NFTs as a more flexible way to handle data ownership as it becomes a yield-bearing asset.  “With the development of NFTs and those maturing, we saw that the ability for you to encode your ownership right of the data set into NFT was very powerful,” said Ocean co-founder Bruce Pon in an interview. “Data NFTs can work on a subscription basis or something like a royalty-based license of an NFT.”  Read more: Ocean v3 Brings Wave of Data Monetization Tools to Ethereum  It’s worth mentioning that Ocean co-founders Pon and Trent McConaghy began adapting blockchain technology to protect ownership rights of digital art as far back as 2013 and soon after founded intellectual property startup Ascribe.  “We’re used to being early, but I think with Ascribe, we were a bit too early,” Pon said. “When it comes to NFTs and data, I think that we’re going to be right in the sweet spot over the next decade.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/08/ocean-protocol-leans-on-nfts-to-drive-decentralized-data-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d44005dad1795072a9ef59647c687286c361fe7-4288x2848.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Will the buyers manage to skyrocket prices to $1.50? Key technical points: The THETA price action shows the breakout of a falling channel. The price action shows a high likelihood of a bullish reversal from $1.15. The 24-hour trading volume of Theta is $89.20 Million, indicating a fall of 26%. Past Performance of THETA THETA prices showcase the end of a long-term downtrend under a long-coming resistance trendline for the past two months. The downfall started after facing opposition near the 200-day EMA in April resulting in a dip to $1.15 where a consolidation range prevented further depreciation. The consolidation shows a sideways trend surpassing the resistance trendline but struggles to rise higher. Source- Tradingview THETA Technical Analysis THETA price action showcases the lack of bullish momentum to fuel the breakout rally evident by the low trading volume compared to the last few weeks. Hence, the bears have the opportunity to overtake the trend control and result in the fallout of $1.15. The crucial daily EMAs (50, 100, and 200-days) fall in a bearish alignment which indicates a long correction phase.

Custodia Bank, which went by the name Avanti Bank and Trust, was founded in 2020 by Morgan Stanley banker Caitlin Long. For about 19 months, it has been seeking to get a Fed master account so that it can directly access the central bank without going through a third-party intermediary financial institution.

These concerns have most likely compounded declines in crypto markets, the report said.  “Volatility has affected user adoption,” the Wall Street giant said, noting that trading volumes and active addresses spiked around the time of the luna (LUNC) collapse, which indicates user adoption, but these increases have since reverted to previous levels, or even lower.  According to Citi, “Tentative evidence suggests a reduction in trading volumes and futures positions but not wholesale declines in investor interest in the space.""  ”After luna’s collapse, there were concerns about outflows in USDT, but these have since slowed,"" the bank said. Some flows went to the more “transparent and centralized” USD coin (USDC) stablecoin, while others exited the market altogether.  Total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) has fallen in U.S. dollar terms but is stable in terms of ether (ETH), especially when accounting for the value lost in the Anchor protocol following the collapse of UST and LUNC, the note said.  DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without traditional intermediaries.  Morgan Stanley (MS) said weakness in crypto markets, the failure of a dollar stablecoin and a reduction in leverage in DeFi was resulting in the “crypto equivalent of quantitative tightening,” in a report Tuesday.

The testnet merging is a dress rehearsal for Ethereum&apos;s mainnet Merge, which is expected later this year and will entail the same process.

Pierre Person, an outgoing member of the National Assembly who penned a landmark and largely positive 2018 report on crypto regulation, now says banks should be fined if they refuse to serve crypto clients. He has proposed a ban on crypto mining based on fossil fuels.  “The European Union has not adopted a clear strategy regarding crypto-assets,” Person said, contrasting the bloc’s stance with U.S. President Joe Biden’s recent executive order, and China’s banning of private crypto as it seeks greater control over its people.  “The European Union is hesitating, groping, trying without much conviction,” Person said. “Europe's postures are more defensive than proactive regarding the new challenges.”  That follows a turbulent few months that nearly saw bitcoin-style proof of work technology banned outright, lawmakers threatening new identity checks for transactions with unhosted wallets, and crypto markets condemned by European Central Bank officials “Wild West” and a “Ponzi scheme.”  In 2018, Person, a member of President Emmanuel Macron’s ruling party, authored a report – that was adopted by France’s lower house – which called for an easing of tax rules for crypto, as well as boosted regulation of the then-popular initial coin offerings (ICOs).  DeFi  Now, he feels the world has moved on.  “In 2018, no one could have foreseen the developments in a sector that only let us see on the surface simple promises on projects that were often shaky,” he said, calling for a “paradigm evolution” to give DAOs – the bodies that develop applications in decentralized finance (DeFi) – legal recognition alongside other corporate entities, and also give new legal status to NFTs.  Read more: ECB's Panetta Blasts Crypto as ‘Ponzi Scheme’ Fueled by Greed  Traditional banks should stop seeking to “denounce and hinder” DeFi rivals, and crypto miners ought to be encouraged to use renewable energy as the bloc seeks to cut carbon emissions, he said – a proposal that appears to echo recent controversial measures taken in the state of New York.  Some in France hope the country can become a crypto hub, and exchange Binance has already registered there. With legislative elections looming, Person himself won’t be a lawmaker for more than a couple of weeks, but his message for his successors is clear.  “Political will is the most precious thing,” he said. “ At the time of writing, the evidence is simple.

Solana Bets Big on South Korea The 100 million dollar fund will focus on gaming studios, GameFi, NFTs, and DeFi in South Korea. The fund is reportedly backed by capital from the Solana community treasury in addition to the venture arm&apos;s pool of capital. Lee told the tech publication that investing in South Korea is a &apos;natural fit&apos; since gaming and NFTs account for the majority of activity that Solana receives from the country. &apos;A big portion of Korea&apos;s gaming industry is moving into web3. We want to be flexible; there&apos;s a wide range of project sizes, team sizes, so some of [our investments] will be venture-sized checks,&apos; he said. Furthermore, he even predicted that there will be more &apos;high-quality and fun games&apos; launching on the Solana blockchain in the second half of the year. These games will have the potential to alter the current perception that &apos;play-to-earn games aren&apos;t fun&apos;, according to him.

The majority of assets have been in a bearish trend, following the broader market sentiment. Some have managed to weather the storm better than others. Let&apos;s compare and contrast the two digital assets, $SAND and $NXTT. Comparing Performance The Sandbox ($SAND) has been one of the hardest-hit tokens amidst this crypto downturn. The Sandbox, a gaming project that aims to create a blockchain-based virtual world, has seen its token price drop from $6 at the start of the year to under $1.30, as of writing, representing a nearly 80% loss. Meanwhile, $NXTT, the token behind Next Earth, has maintained relative stability throughout the bear market and is down just around 38% year-to-date. NXTT launched at around $0.001 in late January, and now sits at around $0.0034, and was recently at $0.004. In the meantime, many other altcoins, particularly small-cap altcoins and ICO tokens, have seen their prices plummet by 80% or more. So, while $NXTT is down from its peak, it&apos;s actually one of the better-performing altcoins in this market downturn. Comparing The Projects On the surface, both The Sandbox and Next Earth have a lot in common. Both are projects that are focusing on building a virtual world on the blockchain.

In current multi-chain ecosystems, users have to set up multiple wallets or bridges, paying gas fees on transactions between tokens. DeversiFi founder Will Harborne said he aims to solve this by integrating multiple chains to facilitate more efficient transactions.  “We remove the cognitive load and complexity – they can just buy tokens on other chains without ever needing to consider the bridges,” said Harborne.  According to Harborne, DeversiFi currently has 63,000 users. It will build out its cross-chain feature by first integrating Polygon and, in the coming months, incorporate Avalanche, BNB Chain, Optimism and Arbitrum.  In order to facilitate this upgrade, DeversiFi is partnering with decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator ParaSwap to aid users in converting their USDT or USDC tokens into Polygon tokens to keep transactions within DeversiFi.  DeversiFi’s cross-chain upgrade follows a trend of protocols looking to multichain. In March, DeFi protocol Aave launched its version 3 upgrade to prioritize cross-chain swaps, and in April, DeFi platform Hashflow introduced bridgeless, cross-chain swaps.  However, cross-chain capabilities don’t come without risk.  The $625 million Ronin Hack (the blockchain behind Axie Infinity) exposed the safety risks associated with sacrificing decentralization in cross-chain transactions. Similarly, the Poly Network hack in August may have been triggered by signing a cross-chain message, accidentally leaking a private key.  “We don’t reduce the risk,” said Harborne on DeversiFi’s launch. “We simply make it far easier for users to access other chains.”",POSITIVE,BNB,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MATIC | BNB,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/08/deversifi-launches-cross-chain-swaps-for-bridgeless-defi-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3977b581fd25e5969b2a1bef4c32ad5c9d9ee36-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The token is trading above the middle BB, floating higher with rising trading volumes. Currently, the coin is up 12 percent versus the USDT. Meanwhile, it is outperforming the BTC and ETH within the past 24 hours, adding roughly 15 percent.

As per the Ocean Protocol candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, buyers may search for entries on dips above the middle BB on the lower end and $0.25—the resistance level of the $0.06 consolidation.

Two key players in the speedy network’s ecosystem, Solana Ventures and the Solana Foundation, will seed investments and grants “across all Web 3 verticals,” a press release said. But their emphasis will be on courting South Korea’s crypto games development sector.  The weeks-old funding effort puts Solana in direct competition with Polygon, Avalanche and other smart contract platforms all gunning for Korea’s trove of orphaned crypto developers. It’s unclear how many Terra developers will return to the ecosystem after its May implosion wiped out billions of dollars in wealth.  “It's not only due to the drastic crash” in twin tokens terraUSD and LUNA that developers are balking at Terra 2.0, said Jaemin Park, a growth manager at DeSpread. “But also people's perception that the chain has 'key person' risk, as well as doubts that if their dapps would have any meaningful user base since the fundamental community has almost evaporated.”  While the Solana funding will spread across Web 3 projects, it will have special focus on bolstering Korea-based blockchain game developers, according to Austin Federa, head of Communications for the Solana Foundation. South Korea’s gaming sector overall was valued at over $15 billion in 2021. The idea is to harness at least some of that potential for crypto games, too.  “They know how to build stuff over there. Big beautiful games. It’s really something to see,” a source formerly at Solana Labs told CoinDesk.
