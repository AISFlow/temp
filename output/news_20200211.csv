42403989,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh9u4,1581453000,Why Exchanges List Small-Cap Coins Despite 51% Attacks,"Ashwin Ramachandran is a junior partner at Dragonfly Capital, a cross-border crypto venture fund. Haseeb Quereshi is a managing partner.      On January 23, bitcoin gold was 51 percent attacked and $72,000 was double-spent. This is the second time bitcoin gold (BTG) has been attacked, and its aftermath left many people wondering: Why don’t exchanges delist bitcoin gold and other easily 51 percent-attackable proof-of-work (PoW) coins?      Turns out, there’s a simple answer. But first, let’s examine the circumstances of how this attack was performed.    Bitcoin gold is a fork of bitcoin that uses the ASIC-resistant ZHash mining algorithm. ZHash is optimized for efficient GPU mining and increases the difficulty of ASIC development due to its high memory requirements. GPUs are widely available for rental since they are commoditized and in large supply relative to ASICs, so it’s easy to rent enough hash power to dominate the bitcoin gold network. Hash power marketplaces, such as NiceHash and MiningRigRentals, have dramatically decreased the costs of performing a 51 percent attack, and similar marketplaces are popping up left and right (see Warihashhttps://warihash.com/, Luxor, etc).    The recent attack on bitcoin gold required up-front capital costs of $3,400 (0.4 BTC to reorganize a total of 29 blocks assuming linear slippage), but note that this cost was recouped through block rewards on the reorganized chain. Because of the inexpensive overall cost, this attack could have been performed entirely using spot GPU rental markets. Furthermore, because GPU rental markets are becoming increasingly liquid, the cost of overtaking a GPU mineable network is decreasing (see NiceHash pricing). Thus, the up-front capital required by the attackers is only the bitcoin gold they wanted to double-spend, plus the hash power costs. The BTG attackers double-spent an estimated $72,000 and paid only $3,400 (recouping roughly $4,200 through block rewards), giving them an ROI of about 96.6 percent, making this a wildly profitable attack.      And, of course, the primary victims of 51 percent attacks are exchanges. The attack generally goes like this: The attacker deposits coins on an exchange, those coins are traded for some other liquid coins like BTC, and then the BTC is withdrawn. The original deposit transaction is later reverted by the 51 percent attacker, allowing them to get back their original deposit and essentially double their money. Because of this vulnerability, exchanges wait a confirmation period (originally 12 blocks on Binance for bitcoin gold) before allowing coins to be withdrawn. But while these confirmation periods increase security, they cannot prevent attacks outright. For more on the mechanics of 51 percent attacks, check out this tweetstorm on the ethereum classic (ETC) attack last year.    It is more profitable for Binance to list low-mid market cap PoW coins, even with their potential losses due to 51 percent attacks.    Bitcoin gold’s 51 percent attack was the second in just two years (the first bitcoin gold attack was much larger), yet BTG remains traded on exchanges like Binance to this day. Naturally, the question arises: why doesn’t Binance delist BTG?      Binance currently trades about $4.13 million in BTG/BTC volume per week. So Binance makes around $429,000 per year in total profit on the BTG/BTC trading pair alone (assuming average fees of 20 basis points (maker/taker) per trade and low BNB usage).      After calculating profits for all low-mid market capitalization PoW coins, a trend crystalizes. It is more profitable for Binance to list low-mid market cap PoW coins, even with their potential losses due to 51 percent attacks. The chart below shows estimates of the percentage of hash rate available for rent, along with Binance’s profit estimates (assuming current market prices).      Note: All rented hash power increases the total hashrate of the network. Thus, an attacker must acquire 100 percent of the current hashrate to launch a successful 51 percent attack. All hash power acquisition estimates are also vulnerable to linear market price slippage, which can vastly increase attack costs.      As long as it’s sufficiently profitable, we expect that Binance and other high-volume exchanges will continue to list vulnerable PoW coins. Exchanges can always reduce the probability of a 51 percent attack by increasing the number of confirmations required for withdrawals (Binance increased this for BTG from 12 to 20 following the attack). But, of course, this does not prevent attacks outright and instead merely increases an attacker’s capital costs. Exchanges can further engage in attack prevention by performing prudent anomaly detection on user deposits of small-cap PoW coins. But note that there is no way to directly detect a 51 percent attack before it happens, since renting hashrate does not cause the on-chain hashrate to drop in any way.      The most recent bitcoin gold attack was worth about $72,000, while Binance expects to make $429K from bitcoin gold this year. Likewise, the ethereum classic 51 percent attack netted the attacker approximately $1.1 million, while Binance expects to make about $3.2 million off its trading fees. This is yet another reason why coins do not die after 51 percent attacks.      That said, 51 percent attacks are still an enigma. They seem like a fundamental violation of the proof-of-work security model. But 51 percent attacked coins continue to trade on top exchanges, and often, bizarrely, increase in price after an attack (see ETC, BTG, XVG). We can partly explain this phenomenon by seeing 51 percent attacks as a tax on exchanges and modeling their continued incentives to list vulnerable coins. But as for why 51 percent-attacked coins sometimes appreciate, unfortunately that still remains a mystery.

Japanese cybersecurity firm Trend Micro reported Monday the group, known as Outlaw, had begun infiltrating Linux-based enterprise systems in order to hijack computer power and mine for the privacy coin monero (XMR), a process known as cryptojacking.      Trend Micro's report said Outlaw used a combination of pre-existing tools and new techniques to monitor for programs that could detect its malware.      The newly improved malware can also hunt down and kill existing mining bots – even the group's previous miners – found in infected systems, taking out the competition and improving mining profits. Past iterations had only been able to partially reduce the activity of rival mining bots.      Trend Micro said Outlaw's activity began increasing in December following several months of inactivity. ""[W]e expect the group to be more active in the coming months as we observed changes on the versions we acquired,"" the report reads.      Although Outlaw had previously confined itself to computer systems in China, Trend Micro's report found it was now targeting businesses in Europe and the U.S. The cybersecurity firm found the group targeted several of its honeypots – mechanisms designed to lure hackers to attack it – situated across the Eastern European region.      The report did not disclose the names of any businesses, in the U.S. or elsewhere, that had been affected by Outlaw's malware.      The group might also try to steal information and sell it to the highest bidder, Trend Micro said. Companies in the financial and auto industries that have not recently updated their internet security systems are at high risk, the cybersecurity firm warned.      Outlaw first came to prominence in 2018 after it installed crypto-mining bots in the software of internet-of-things (IoT) devices. In 2019, Trend Micro detected the group attacking computer systems in China with a similar malware design that would hijack computer power to mine monero.      Malware that hijacks computer power to mine monero is not uncommon. In February 2018, more than half a million computers were infected with a botnet that mined nearly 9,000 XMR tokens (then worth approximately $3.6 million) over a nine-month period. Being a privacy coin, hackers can sell monero without risk of detection from authorities.      Very little is known about the Outlaw hacking group, not even what it call itself.

42403992,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh9x1,1581447609,Options Market Sees More Risk in Ether Than Bitcoin in Coming Months,"Ether will face more volatility than bitcoin over the next six months, according to how options have been priced in recent weeks.      The spread between the six-month, at-the-money implied volatility for ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) has increased to a six-month high of 22 percentage points, notes crypto-derivatives analytics firm Skew.      The recent spike in the ETH-BTC six-month implied volatility spread shows investors are expecting bigger percentage moves in ether (in either direction) than in bitcoin over the next 180 days.      The spread bottomed out at 4.7 percentage points at the end of October and has been on an upward trajectory ever since.      Interestingly, ether has consistently witnessed bigger percent moves than bitcoin over the last 3.5 months, validating the uptick in the implied volatility spread.      While bitcoin dropped by 21 percent in the final two months of 2019, ether shed nearly 30 percent. This year it's a different story: Ether is reporting 73 percent gains on a year-to-date basis compared to bitcoin’s 37 percent gains.      Implied volatility is the market’s expectation of how risky an asset will be in the future. It is the standard deviation of returns traders are forecasting. Implied volatility is computed by taking an option and the underlying asset’s price. It also uses other inputs, such as time to expiration. One then backsolves for implied volatility by using such options pricing models as Black-Scholes-Merton.      Volatility has a positive impact on options price. The higher the volatility (uncertainty), the stronger the hedging demand is for both call (bullish bet) and put options (bearish bet).      Implied volatility doesn’t give any certainty on directions, but only indicates a big bullish or bearish move could be in the offing. However, traders usually associate increased volatility with bear markets, as it is “risky” for most investors.    Ether is, relatively, not as risky as before versus bitcoin    Ether has been more volatile recently, yet in recent months it wasn’t all that more risky an asset compared to bitcoin, according to historical volatility spread.      Realized or historical volatility is the standard deviation from the average price of the underlying asset, expressed in percentage terms. The higher the historical volatility, the riskier the asset.      The ETH-BTC six-month realized volatility spread jumped to 13 percentage points last week to hit the highest level since July 13.      The gauge has increased sharply from lows near 2.3 percentage points seen in early December, suggesting an increase in the risk inherent in ether relative to bitcoin.      That said, the average historical volatility spread over the last three years has been 29 percentage points, significantly higher than what was recently observed. Ether has relatively reduced its risk to a level closer to that of bitcoin’s.    Volatility and mean reversion    Mean reversion theory posits that over time a metric will move back to its average historical levels. If that’s the case, the same is applicable for both implied and historical volatility.

42403986,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh9t5,1581446066,Vermont Turns to Home-Grown Blockchain Company to Track Hemp With Ethereum,"Vermont regulators will track hemp production on the ethereum mainnet in partnership with cannabis supply chain blockchain startup Trace.      The five-year deal, announced Monday by Vermont’s Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets (VAAFM), is a production-ready solution for every level of the hemp trade, said Trace CEO Josh Decatur. Beginning in March, farmers and processors will begin putting all associated crop data into the Trace system, which runs on ethereum.      It is one of the first times a state regulatory agency has decided to run with the ethereum mainnet, Decatur told CoinDesk in a phone call. The two-year-old company, based in Vermont's capital Montpelier, has built an app users can share details through, and gas fees for conducting transactions are passed onto the users – in this case, the state government.      “Everyone is deriving value from innate blockchain tech – namely the security that comes with public permissionless blockchain technology,” he said.      Vermont’s regulators said this is the first full-scale government registration and licensing system that pairs blockchain with the nascent hemp industry. Hemp was legalized nationally in the 2018 Farm Bill, but Vermont’s program runs under the 2014 edition.      A cannabis strain used in the textiles industry, hemp represents a small but growing slice of Vermont’s agriculture sector. The Green Mountain State had just 1,000 registered hemp farmers in 2019 with nearly 9,000 acres of farmland, as well as 300 processors, according Stephanie Smith, VAAFM’s Hemp Program manager.      “It’s important to understand what’s being grown, where it's being grown and where it’s going after being harvested,” she said.      The mini-boom foreshadowed VAAFM’s call for a hemp registration system. Trace, whose CEO has roots in the Northern California grow scene, beat out the competition. Being based in Vermont didn't hurt either.      “We spent the last couple of years finding innovative ways to hone a product that could meet the tracking and data requirements of a state agency,” Decatur said.      His Vermont-based team had been building “seed-to-shelf” tools for other sectors of the cannabis supply chain, such as cannabidiol (CBD) products. The company built patented software, an app and a web portal to document where, when and to whom a plant and its derivative products move.      Trace’s solution relies on the ethereum network. At 15 transactions per second, the network is hardly a salve for industrial users moving massive amounts of data. But that doesn’t matter for the low-frequency hemp lot farmers who, Decatur said, only send three to four transactions per year.      “The use case that we’ve applied the tech to fits into the performance restrictions of ethereum,” he said.      Trace’s registration system should be live by the end of March, according to Smith, in time for the start of the outdoor growing season in June.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/11/vermont-turns-to-home-grown-blockchain-company-to-track-hemp-with-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66c5c80caa9ff908402317f978e32c4ae1fd1269-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403975,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh9iG,1581436800,ConsenSys Project Launches 'Proof-of-Use' Network to Discourage Speculation,"A ConsenSys-built platform launching its first project Tuesday aims to support ethereum projects while discouraging speculative investing and trading in the projects' tokens.      Activate – a decentralized token network that actively polices speculative token making – announced it was going live with SKALE, an ethereum scaling project, as its first partner. The project is also partnering with the NODE Foundation, a nonprofit focused on promoting the SKALE network.      Activate is part of ConsenSys Codefi, an ethereum-based operating system for decentralized finance (DeFi) products.      Activate sets standards for the purchase, distribution and use of utility tokens. Its “proof-of-use” protocol requires tokens to be usable at or immediately after selling tokens to participants and that tokens are used for their intended purpose.      SKALE CEO Jack O'Holleran said that after a Dutch auction his token will go live on the ethereum mainnet and tokens will not be able to be transferred for a 90-day proof-of-use period.      “It’s filtering out people who don’t want to participate in the network,” O'Holleran said. “You have to buy the token, and you have to stake at least 50 percent of that asset.”      SKALE is a proof-of-stake platform designed to boost the scalability of the ethereum blockchain. Last October, the network told CoinDesk it will enable dapps to conduct millions of transactions per second at a much lower cost than transactions currently conducted on ethereum. More than 35 dApps are building on SKALE, including games, DeFi, audio streaming platforms and more.      SKALE token holders must contribute to the security and scalability of SKALE’s network by delegating to validators or serving as validators on network, who earn rewards in the form of SKALE tokens.      Because of ConsenSys’ tie to ethereum, O’Holleran said launching with Activate will bring in stakers that have a long-term interest in supporting ethereum and other decentralized protocols. SKALE will keep using Activate after the token launch for managing validators.    Regulatory compliance    Activate also requires tokens reach maturity – either decentralization of token functionality – within 28 days of the first token sale. Each team has to disclose critical information on a freely accessible website and the token must be offered and sold for the purpose of facilitating access to, participation on or development of the token network.      The requirements are strikingly similar to a proposal put forth by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioner Hester Peirce (also known as “CryptoMom”) that would give firms a three-year grace period from their first token sale to achieve a level of decentralization sufficient to satisfy the agency’s assessment of whether an asset is a security.      Pierce’s proposal would impose a set of requirements for crypto projects to raise funds through a token sale, including requiring personal disclosures, code disclosures, public notices and a number of other factors. A project’s source code, transaction history, token economics, roadmap and history of past token sales would all be disclosed on a free and publicly accessible website.      While Activate’s requirements for token projects and Pierce’s proposal are similar, the startup’s token restrictions came out of “the Brooklyn project,” an initiative ConsenSys started in November 2017 in response to concerns regulators had already raised about token launches.      “The biggest thing in our platform is proof of use,” said Collin Myers, head of global product strategy at ConsenSys. “This is encoded … it’s not like a bandaid type solution.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/11/consensys-project-launches-proof-of-use-network-to-discourage-speculation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/86774364f353051bf2396980901dc7cd9cd4a87d-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Tangle is IOTA’s scalable distributed ledger (DLT) network that, unlike blockchains, employs a system where users confirm transactions as they send new ones.      A total of 15 companies have joined the working group as founding members including Dell, German electronics provider STMicroelectronics and the University of Magdeburg.      “The Eclipse Foundation will provide a vendor-neutral governance framework for open collaboration, with IOTA’s scalable, feeless, and permissionless DLT as a base,” said Mike Milinkovich, executive director of the Eclipse Foundation. “By doing so, we will accelerate the development of new applications built with this transformative technology.”      Dominik Schiener, co-founder of the IOTA Foundation, told CoinDesk multiple companies reported they wanted to see code tested and reviewed before they themselves would go about integrating it. By enabling thorough testing of Tangle, the working group will be a ""major stepping stone"" for realizing IOTA's vision, he said.      The open-source project will help increase access to IOTA' s technology, according to IOTA co-founder David Sonstebo. Decentralized identities and decentralized marketplaces, which can facilitate real-time trading, and decentralized identities, will be the working group's initial projects.

42383268,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uylh,1581431425,German Bank to Offer Tokenized Securities Based on Stellar,"One of the oldest banks in Europe is developing a special-purpose euro stablecoin that can facilitate private placements in tokenized securities.      Munich-based Bank von der Heydt, established in 1754, announced Monday it had partnered with blockchain financial services provider Bitbond to help integrate tokenization into its established securitization platform.      The partnership will allow the bank to tokenize digital securities onto the Stellar blockchain, which it can offer to institutional clients via private placements.      Tokenization can simplify equity sales and eliminate much of the associated frictional costs, according to the bank. ""[S]ecurities can be traded directly without an intermediary, making financing much cheaper and less complicated,"" a bank representative wrote Monday.      There are no plans for von der Heydt to enable broader public access to the platform.      Clients will be able to securely store tokenized equity in a custody solution developed by Bitbond and von der Heydt in 2019. The solution received approval from the German financial regulator BaFin after changes in the law meant providers required a license to continue offering cryptocurrency custody.      Investors will be able to purchase tokenized equity using a euro stablecoin that will also be issued by von der Heydt. Clients will be able to convert euros into stablecoins, which can also be stored in the bank's custody solution.      Radoslav Albrecht, Bitbond founder and CEO, told CoinDesk that ""digital euro payments will happen much faster, there will be a real-time, on-chain DvP (delivery versus payment of securities) and the bank doesn't need to involve a third-party paying agent but can provide everything independently.""      A production version will be deployed at the beginning of April, according to Albrecht.      Bitbond recieved BaFin approval for its tokenized bond in January 2019, going on to launch Germany's first regulated security token offering (STO) later that year.

The Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange announced Tuesday users would be able to trade rubles directly with bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), tether (USDT) and binance coin (BNB) without any transaction fees. This is the third fiat currency – after the Chinese yuan and Vietnamese dong – Binance has integrated into its peer-to-peer platform.      ""Russia is a vibrant market for blockchain and crypto advancement. We strive to provide our Russian users with easy fiat-to-crypto access,"" said Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao. ""P2P trading provides an open marketplace and more flexible access for users to trade multiple cryptocurrencies with other users or merchants in the payment methods they prefer.""

Russia's central bank announced it was developing its own ""CryptoRuble"" in November 2018, although there have been no updates since. The government has also been deliberating on a new cryptocurrency bill over the past two years. Details remain scant but there are concerns the bill could prohibit, or severely hamper, cryptocurrency trading.      Hinting about possible concerns with the country's regulators, CZ has made overtures to the Russian cryptocurrency sector in the past, describing Russia as a ""key market"" for Binance during a visit in October last year.      He added he wanted Binance to increase its Russian presence by opening an office in the country: “There is a very strong programmer talent [here],” CZ said. “On this trip, it is very clear to me that we should look into [setting up] the developers’ office.""

42383254,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uyWb,1581419946,Joint Venture Launches Canadian Dollar-Pegged Stablecoin for Financial Services,"A new stablecoin pegged to the Canadian dollar may help digitize the North American nation’s financial markets.      Canada Stablecorp announced Monday it was issuing the ""QCAD"" stablecoin for “mass market,” including foreign exchange remittances and other financial products. Canada Stablecorp is a joint venture between cryptoasset manager 3iQ, which recently received approval to launch a bitcoin fund, and Mavennet Systems, a blockchain development firm launched last year.      QCAD is being described as both a means of payment and a settlement solution. “It allows you to trade, to take positions against other stablecoins in other currencies, USDC in the U.S. for example,” said Canada Stablecorp CEO Jean Desgagne. “It provides a medium of exchange and value.”      The coin is backed by Canadian dollars, Desgagne said. He envisions the token – built on the ethereum ERC-20 standard – as a tool for foreign exchange remittances, among other use cases. The hope is it will become the first mainstream stablecoin pegged to the Canadian dollar to see general use (while similar stablecoins have been launched before, few have lasted).      The token is compliant with know-your-customer and anti-money laundering regulations, Desgagne said. It will be issued by Canada Stablecorp and traded on DVeX, Newton, Bitvo, Netcoins and Coinsmart – five Canada-based crypto exchanges.      These platforms will be responsible for conducting their own KYC/AML checks in compliance with relevant regulations, Desgagne continued. Any investors – including those outside Canada – who can trade on these exchanges can buy QCAD.      While the other key regulatory concern could come from securities law, Desgagne said the company had a legal opinion saying it was not a huge concern.      “It’s worth a dollar today, it’ll be worth a dollar tomorrow, it’ll be worth a dollar 20 years from now,” Desgagne said. “We believe that it’s not a security, it doesn’t need to touch with securities law. It’s really a mechanism for exchange.”      The company built its token on ethereum due to the network’s wide popularity and Stablecorp’s comfort with its levels of security, Desgagne said. While additional stablecoins might be issued on other networks in the future, this is more of an eventual goal than anything being planned at the moment.      Broadly, Desgagne hopes to further digitize financial services as QCAD grows in acceptance.      “[I think we’re taking] financial market infrastructure that exists in the analog world and create them in the digital world,” Desgagne said. “We believe we’re creating tools for digital assets to truly bloom.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/11/joint-venture-launches-canadian-dollar-pegged-stablecoin-for-financial-services,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2de8ce3ed5a224170536b2c7c1bd80a7d9e9d0f4-1500x912.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383273,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uytF,1581419009,Monday’s Price Drop Didn’t Break Bitcoin’s Bullish Trend,"View  Bitcoin's broader uptrend is still valid despite Monday's sudden move lower from $10,200. The weekly chart shows scope for a test of the October high of $10,350.  A deeper pullback to support below $9,600 may be seen before the return of the rally, as the short duration charts are indicating buyer exhaustion.  A UTC close under $9,075 (Feb. 4 high) would invalidate the bullish setup.    Bitcoin’s broader bullish trend is intact despite Monday’s sharp retreat from a 3.5-month high over $10,000.      The cryptocurrency ran into offers near $10,200 and fell to levels near $9,730 during the Asian trading hours on Monday and spent the rest of the day trading in the narrow range of $9,750–$9,900.      Prices closed Monday (UTC) with a 3.18 percent loss, the second-largest daily decline of 2020 – the first being a 3.2 percent slide seen on Jan. 23, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Some observers are disappointed bitcoin’s break above $10,000 was short-lived. “Disheartening to see BTC reject us not even 24 hours after breaking 10K,” derivatives trader John Wick tweeted earlier on Tuesday.      According to Wick, the speed of bitcoin's ascent (or bullish momentum) has slowed. After all, Monday’s drop completely engulfed the price gains seen on Sunday – a sign of buyer exhaustion.      However, the broader uptrend from January lows below $7,000 is still intact because prices are hovering well above the base (higher low) of $9,075, established on Feb. 4.      As long as that support stays intact, the path of least resistance will remain to the higher side. At press time, bitcoin is trading near $9,796, representing a 0.58 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.    Daily chart    Bitcoin has carved out a bearish engulfing pattern, marking a negative follow-through to Sunday’s bullish ""marubozu"" candle.      A failed marubozu at multi-month highs often paves the way for deeper price pullbacks.    Hourly chart    Bitcoin breached the head-and-shoulders neckline support during the Asian trading hours Tuesday. So far, the downside has been contained near $9,700.      The breakdown, however, could yet encourage selling and lead to a stronger move to the downside. The cryptocurrency looks set to revisit former hurdle-turned-support at $9,586 (Nov. 4 high) in the short term. Acceptance below that level would expose the Feb. 4 low of $9,075.      The immediate bullish case would be revived if prices rise above $10,010, invaliding the lower-highs setup on the hourly charts, as discussed yesterday.    Building a base?    It's worth noting that corrections are a normal occurrence in bull markets and often end up recharging engines for the next leg higher. “If I was climbing a rock wall I would want to constantly re-anchor. Same idea with assets, build a base,” popular trader Cantering Clark tweeted Monday.      For instance, bitcoin fell from $9,188 on Jan. 19 and revisited the former hurdle-turned-support of $8,200 five days later, before rallying above $10,000.      While the ongoing correction may be extended, the crucial support at $9,075 will likely hold as the longer duration charts are reporting strong bullish conditions.    Weekly chart    Bitcoin has risen strongly over the last few weeks, having witnessed a falling channel breakout in early January.      The MACD histogram is printing higher consecutive bars above the zero line, a sign of the strengthening of bullish momentum. The five- and 10-day averages are also trending north in favor of the bulls.

The San Francisco-based crypto exchange announced the news in a tweet on Monday, saying the state's residents can now buy, sell and exchange zcash (ZEC) on Coinbase.com, as well as in its iOS and Android apps.      Last August, Coinbase U.K. quietly dropped support for zcash, providing no reason in letters to its customers. However, the move came as British regulators were saying exchange platforms may need to be able to provide personal data on transactors of cryptocurrencies.      Zcash allows users the option to conceal (or shield) details of their transactions using a type of zero-knowledge proof called zk-SNARKs. Coinbase had previously said when it added zcash in late 2018 that it would support both shielded and unshielded addresses, but would only allow unshielded withdrawals.      Also announced by the exchange for New York users on Monday was the addition of the dollar-linked USDC stablecoin, first issued by Coinbase and Circle Financial as part of the CENTRE consortium in the autumn of 2018.      Coinbase said allowing U.S. users to earn interest on their holdings of the stablecoin last October, at an annual percentage yield of 1.25 percent.

42383271,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uyrz,1581415200,Childhood Friends Battle Over Ownership of North America's Largest Bitcoin Mine,"Just four years ago, two lifelong friends from New Orleans turned a small initial investment into the largest crypto miner in North America.      When their company, Coinmint, bought a former Alcoa plant in upstate New York, they brought hope the new economics of cryptocurrencies would revive a region that suffered with the decline of American manufacturing.      But just as they should be preparing for the impending “halving” of bitcoin in May – an era-defining moment for the industry – the four-year-old company is now grappling with an existential threat: a lawsuit filed in a Delaware court by one of its two co-founders, who is seeking nothing less than the dissolution of the company and liquidation of its assets.      The business of mining bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using high-speed computers is humming: Bitcoin prices are up 36 percent this year alone after nearly doubling in 2019. Mining firms are scrambling to raise capital from investors to set up large-scale data centers, upgrade equipment and expand processing power. The bitcoin network is months away from its next “halving” – a once-every-four-years occurrence that some analysts say could drive prices even higher. Before that happens, the partnership that owns Coinmint may itself be halved, along with the lifelong friendship of its co-founders.      Coinmint was started in 2016 when childhood friends Ashton Soniat and Prieur Leary each put $25,000 into the cryptocurrency prospecting firm. They would go on to develop a bitcoin mine in Massena, N.Y., that is now believed to be the largest such facility in North America; it draws some 80 megawatts of power, or the same amount used by roughly 60,000 average U.S. households.      Executives with the project have been lining up financing to install another 40 megawatts worth of capacity by May. The new production would come on line just in time for the halving, which under the terms of the bitcoin network’s original protocol will cut in half the number of bitcoins awarded to miners for helping to confirm data transactions on the blockchain. If bitcoin’s price surges, mining firms could win big. If it doesn’t, they would likely see a steep drop-off in profits.      Leary, a co-founder who until recently was Coinmint’s president, filed the dissolution suit in Delaware Chancery Court in December, claiming Soniat, who serves as CEO, unilaterally moved Coinmint’s headquarters to Puerto Rico and then shut him out of day-to-day management.      In phone interviews from his home in Miami Beach, Fla., Leary, 51, said he has put a lot of time, effort and money into Coinmint and he doesn’t want his investment at risk. He said Coinmint has received purchase offers from private equity firms at valuations above $80 million, but Soniat has thus far spurned any deal.      “I believe that it's imprudent to risk your entire business on whether the halving is priced in or not,” Leary said.      In an email, Soniat, 50, said he is prepared to defend himself against the “spurious allegations” and that Leary’s claims are baseless. Soniat said he’s poured in almost all of the additional capital needed to fund Coinmint’s development and operations, and that Leary’s stake now amounts to just 18 percent. He contends Leary was fully aware of Coinmint’s conversion to a Puerto Rican limited liability company in 2018.      Leary’s actions are “simply another misguided attempt” to “bolster his financial standing at the expense of a company in which he owns an interest,” the statement read. “Despite the distraction of the lawsuit, Coinmint has continued to focus on, and is committed to, building a world-class cryptocurrency-mining enterprise.”      The dispute comes at a critical time for the crypto-mining industry, which has evolved in recent years from being dominated by hobbyists or small operators running one or a handful of computers in their kitchens or basements. With bitcoin and cryptocurrencies now gaining momentum, the business has become the province of big-money, institutional-scale developers, requiring wholesale electricity procurement contracts, large-scale site management and heavy capital investments in state-of-the-art data centers.      In an example of the rising costs of crypto mining, Coinmint went so far as to pay $15,000 a month last year to retain a New York-based public affairs adviser, Michael McKeon of the consulting firm Mercury. McKeon was a top communications aide and campaign adviser to former New York Governor George Pataki and also worked on former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s presidential campaign in 2008.      New bitcoin mining facilities sprouting up in Texas, Washington State, New York and some Canadian provinces are becoming so large they’ve been pitched as economic development projects to create jobs for remote communities with otherwise few opportunities. Indeed, Coinmint Chief Financial Officer Michael Maloney said in an interview the planned expansion at Massena will add about 50 jobs, in addition to the roughly 100 employees who work there now.      Yet, as with many of the projects across the nation, there’s been an accompanying backlash. Nearby residents complain of elevated electricity bills. Environmentalists warn the extra draw on power from crypto mines could lead to more emissions from fossil fuel-burning generating plants, contributing to climate change.      Listen or subscribe to the Markets Daily News Roundup with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocketcasts, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Stitcher, RadioPublica or RSS.    From Big Easy to Big Difficulty    Coinmint’s story dates back decades before bitcoin was even invented. Leary and Soniat became acquainted as teenagers living in New Orleans in the 1980s.      “We went to different schools but we were in the same circles,” Leary recalled. “We were mostly party friends. We had a group of guys that all hung around together, and he was in our group.”      Soniat pursued a career in energy trading, working for the likes of Enron, TXU Energy and Deutsche Bank before starting his own firm in 2009. Leary went into the data-center business.      When Leary called Soniat in 2016 to pitch the idea of forming a partnership to start a bitcoin mine, it seemed like a natural fit. Both men had endured acrimonious breakups in prior business ventures that ended in courtroom disputes, but the cryptocurrency venture provided new grounds for optimism.      “It made sense,” Soniat said in a phone interview from Puerto Rico. “I looked at bitcoin mining as a play on electricity.”      Following the initial $25,000 capital contribution from each of the partners, Soniat provided nearly all of the capital needed for the buildout.      “Ashton was more on the financial side,” Leary said. “I'm the guy who found the sites and made it happen.”      The first two years were good for the business, Leary said, with bitcoin prices rallying 30-fold over the course of 2016 and 2017. Soniat, who lives in Puerto Rico, donated $150,000 to the island territory’s Sacred Heart University to strengthen a scholarship program, according to a February 2017 report from the Puerto Rican business-news website News Is My Business.      That same year, the pal-partners secured a lease on 1,300 acres at a former Alcoa aluminum-smelting plant in the town of Massena in upstate New York, not far from the St. Lawrence River, opposite the eastern end of Ontario, Canada. The town has been hit hard in recent decades by factory closures. As of the most recent census estimates, Massena had an unemployment rate of some 21 percent, more than five times the current U.S. average.      But Massena boasts natural resources that are attractive to bitcoin miners like Coinmint. The regional electricity grid draws supply from nearby hydropower plants, once prized by the smelters. Another key feature is that it’s usually cold, with an average temperature of 44 degrees Fahrenheit (6.7 Celsius). The chilly clime increases the efficiency and reliability of the bitcoin-mining computers, typically running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.      In mid-2018, Coinmint said it would invest as much as $700 million in the Massena facility, creating an estimated 150 jobs over the ensuing 18 months, CNBC reported at the time. The plant has the potential for upgrades up to 435 megawatts of crypto-mining capacity.      “That was the original plan,” Leary said, “but the plan didn’t go the way we thought it was going to go.”      Bitcoin’s price tumbled 73 percent in 2018, raising questions not just about Coinmint’s prospects but about the very future of cryptocurrencies. As the partners deliberated over next steps, the friendship became strained. Coinmint got hit with a lawsuit from a landlord in Plattsburgh, N.Y., where it was operating a separate, smaller bitcoin mine from space in a strip mall. Local residents complained their monthly utility bills were soaring because the operations were sucking up so much electricity. (Coinmint recently suspended operations in Plattsburgh, at least until March.)      In August 2018, Coinmint considered launching its own digital token to pre-sell batches of bitcoin mining processing power known as “hashrate” to buyers. Each token would be equivalent to one terahash, or a trillion computations, of bitcoin mining, according to a press release at the time. The token represented a potential new source of financing, but it has never been listed on a cryptocurrency exchange. A person close to Coinmint said none of the tokens were ever actually sold.      From Leary’s perspective, the Massena project has come to a crossroads where deeper pockets are needed to fund the next phase. He said the company is low on cash reserves, even as it needs a significant jolt of new capital to fund needed expansions and upgrades. He said many of the computers at the Massena facility are older-vintage machines that could become unprofitable following the halving.      “Bitcoin mining has become a big-money business,” Leary said. “Coinmint still has a great advantage, but if you want to compete with the Chinese, you have to partner with deep pockets or you have to have deep pockets yourself.”      Soniat loaned Coinmint more than $20 million, an obligation that until recently remained on the company’s books.      “Ashton is a trader,” Leary said. “He is more aggressive and a risk taker than me. To his credit, the company wouldn't be where it is today without taking some risks. But we’ve reached a point where it’s too big and there’s too much risk. It’s not a fun situation for me.”      Last year, a private equity firm offered to buy a stake in Coinmint at a valuation of over $80 million; a few months later, a reduced offer valued the company closer to $60 million. In addition to the bids from private equity firms, Coinmint attracted interest from Chinese investors but Soniat didn’t want to engage.      “I kept pushing to do a deal,” Leary said. “He thought they were low-ball offers.”      By November of last year, relations between the childhood friends grew so strained that Soniat sent Leary an email saying he wasn’t sure he wanted to work with him anymore.      Leary traveled to Puerto Rico for two days to meet with Soniat, but his old buddy refused to talk with him.      Eventually, Leary’s lawyer, Ben Wolkov of the Miami-based firm AXS Law Group, recommended the dissolution petition.      “It’s a case of one partner just shutting another one out unlawfully, in our view,” Wolkov said in a phone interview. “This company's going to have to deal with the industry waters, and the halving's a concern, having to upgrade the equipment and the capital intensive nature of that endeavor. My client’s been left out in the dark.”      Soniat “went through the roof” when he found out the suit had been filed, and he sent out emails to Coinmint employees telling them not to talk to his partner, Leary said.      Soniat said in the phone interview he’s the majority owner of Coinmint, so decisions over a sale or new financing are his to make. He added that Leary’s description of the private equity offers is “categorically false.”      Coinmint is a private company and Soniat declined to disclose financial details, but noted: “I've provided the vast majority of money for the growth of the company through equity injections.”    Hashing it out – or not?    In the meantime, Coinmint is moving ahead with an expansion of the Massena plant. Maloney, the CFO, who previously worked for the crypto-focused investment firm Galaxy Digital, said in phone interviews the company recently started installing more cryptocurrency-mining computers at the facility and expects the additional capacity to be ready by the start of May, just in time for the halving.      Last month, Coinmint revisited the idea of selling hashpower. It turned to BitOoda, a crypto-focused brokerage firm based in Jersey City, N.J., to arrange a financial contract with an unnamed counterparty for “the purchase and sale of large blocks of physically-delivered bitcoin hashpower,” according to a Jan. 27 press release. Similar to commodity futures, the contracts allow mining firms to hedge against the risk of price drops while raising new financing in the short term.      Terms of the contract weren’t disclosed, but Maloney said the hashpower contracts should bring in funds to support the Massena expansion. BitOoda’s CEO, Tim Kelly, said in a phone interview he has investors lined up to buy “tens of millions of dollars” of the contracts.      “It's difficult to get a loan from a traditional financial company like a bank,” Maloney said. “They don't understand the nature of bitcoin.”      Leary, who wasn’t consulted on the BitOoda contract, says he really just wants a court-mediated solution to the whole affair.      “These partner-friend breakups can be the most unfortunate,” Leary said. “At the end of the day, my goal is to work this out. Hopefully he'll read this article.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | SPONSORED,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/11/childhood-friends-battle-over-ownership-of-north-americas-largest-bitcoin-mine,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/697ab7b606e6b40adc05483338fbb33ece5ade5c-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383255,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uyXr,1581411600,Chinese Insurers Tap Blockchain to Speed Coronavirus Payouts,"Blockchain technology is reportedly helping to streamline medical paperwork processing for insurance service providers as global coronavirus containment efforts continue.      Leveraging blockchain’s ability to process information transparently and efficiently, insurance service providers are relying on the technology to speed claims payouts in over 27 coronavirus affected Chinese cities, as well as Hong Kong, according to a report by South China Morning Post on Sunday.      Xiang Hu Bao, a Chinese online mutual aid platform owned by Ant Financial, has added the coronavirus to its list of eligible claims, enabling a one-time payout of 100,000 yuan (US$14,320) for those affected by the virus.      The claims-sharing platform was built on a blockchain network, leveraging the technology to service its 104 million users by speeding settlement claims and reducing fraud. The service has been made available on Alipay, the most used mobile payments app in China and globally.      An Ant Financial spokesman in Beijing told the South China Morning Post that due to blockchain’s “trust-free nature,” Xiang Hu Bao has been able to process claims and conduct payouts at a much faster rate than with traditional methods.

42383261,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uygf,1581383994,Plasma Became Optimism and It Might Just Save Ethereum,"The ethereum network is still looking to boost transaction capacity, and the startup Optimism wants to lead the charge.      Since the network’s throughput is limited to roughly 15 transactions per second, ethereum can’t become a widespread platform for automating functions, like supply chain management and loans, unless it scales. So Optimism aims to use a layered approach, similar to bitcoin’s Lightning Network, to increase the number of people who can use the network with smart contracts.      Optimism was once the research-oriented nonprofit Plasma Group, focused on building a second layer for ethereum as described by ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and lightning co-creator Joseph Poon in a 2017 paper. Then, in January 2020, the team announced it was transitioning from a research collective to a for-profit startup called Optimism, backed by $3.5 million from Paradigm and IDEO CoLab Ventures.      IDEO CoLab’s Dan Elitzer said the Plasma team realized last year, while participating in one of his firm’s programs, that the market didn’t need the solution they were working on. This “led them to develop their Optimistic Rollup approach,” Elitzer said.      Some critics in the industry see this transition to a for-profit startup as a controversial move. Bitcoin advocates argue Plasma experiments “failed” and Dragonfly Capital partner Ashwin Ramachandran described this transition as “the death of Plasma.”      “It’s like this alien that morphed many times in many different forms and eventually died … at least in the form in which it initially launched,” Ramachandran said in a phone interview.      Addressing such concerns, the startup will launch an alpha testing environment on Tuesday called the Optimistic Virtual Machine (OVM). The OVM, which is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), is meant to give Optimism’s speedier second layer the same smart-contract functionality of the underlying blockchain.      “The OVM enables support for all existing Ethereum developer tooling including Solidity and Vyper, testing frameworks like Truffle, wallets like Metamask, and libraries like Web3.js,” the company said in a statement. “We designed the OVM to be used as drop-in replacement for the EVM inside of Optimistic Rollup.”      By making smart contracts work above the base layer, ethereum advocates aim to finally make ethereum scalable. Optimism co-founder Ben Jones said this second layer will eventually incorporate optimistic rollups, which process more transactions faster, and some type of the quadratic funding auctions proposed by Glen Weyl. The latter is meant to solve a thorny issue the zcash community recently faced: how to fund the decentralized development of a “public good.”      Jones said the details of how this system will work are “still up in the air,” but they’ll probably relate to mining dynamics and network fees.      “The order of transactions themselves are valuable,” Jones said, referencing a concept the lightning-friendly exchange Sparkswap discovered last April. There is positional value to crypto transactions inside a payment channel. Just as with lines at Disneyland, some people will buy a FastPass to get to the front.      For bitcoin, the startup Lightning Labs recently debuted a payment channel management service called Lightning Loop. Jones said network fees are “generally a flexible concept,” so a version of Plasma could also play into the same demand for speed and channel management to offer contributors a variety of ways to earn value beyond mining ether.      It’s too soon to say how the OVM will work, but clearly Buterin’s Plasma dreams are far from dead.    Guarded optimism    Dragonfly’s Ramachandran is quite bullish on optimistic rollups being “the future of ethereum scalability” with “all the things Plasma promised but failed to deliver on.”      Yet, he said he is “uncertain” about the second half of Optimism’s plan, quadratic funding that may involve the addition of a network token beyond ether.      “I don’t necessarily need my own token. I could just use ether,” Ramachandran said.      However, Optimism’s Jones clarified there are no plans for a new network token yet, nor any hard date for a beta launch comparable to what Lightning Labs and Blockstream had for bitcoin in 2018.      So far, there are tests underway via the OVM alpha as the startup gears up for production. This solution will be relevant to both the current Eth 1.x and Eth 2.0, ethereum’s upcoming platform overhaul.      “We expect the Optimism team to continue to execute on their technical roadmap,” IDEO’s Elitzer said, “while also building the necessary buy-in from key teams in the ecosystem to launch a scaling solution that meets the needs of Ethereum developers and end users.”      The startup is still partially Buterin’s brainchild, co-founded by his former Ethereum Foundation collaborator Karl Floersch. With the help of Optimism co-founders Jones and NASDAQ alum Jinglan Wang, the scaling project could leverage a startup model to mature beyond the initial Plasma research.      Elitzer said these cofounders make up a “very special team who lives and breathes Ethereum scalability.” Wang, in particular, has been working in the space for more than five years. For Elitzer, the team’s ability to pivot based on feedback is a bullish sign for ethereum, Crypto Twitter obituaries aside.      “It’s really important to us to close this economic loop and provide a real revenue source for the creation of open-source software,” Jones said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/11/plasma-became-optimism-and-it-might-just-save-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/26094eba3b9a6d63752d7c9c8521fba589695ceb-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
