The digital asset is now trading above $1,300 for the first time since mid-December 2021, and so far, has been able to hold its gains in the market. However, not everyone is betting on the continued growth of the cryptocurrency, which could end up being a deterrent to further upside for the digital asset. Ethereum Whales Go Short Chinese journalist Colin Wu, popularly known as Wu Blockchain on Twitter posted a screenshot that showed that ethereum whales were still very bearish on the digital asset. For one, there were 26,000 put options for the cryptocurrency at a strike price of $400. This is a more than 200% decrease from the current price of the asset.

The traders were placed on Saturday, December 7, according to the photo, showing a high conviction of an expected price drawdown in the coming months.

Recently, there has been a large order of 26,000 ETH put options with a strike price of $400 and an expiration date of Jun 30. Some traders believe this is the tail management behavior of crypto whales. According to @Blofin_Official pic.twitter.com/VmYC44939h — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 7, 2023 Ethereum’s price has already seen a recovery since this trade was placed. But with such a long runway and the expected sell pressure to come from the Shanghai upgrade and withdrawal capabilities for staked ETH, it still remains a possibility that the digital asset would hit this price. ETH at $1,319 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com Not Everyone Is Bearish On ETH Despite such a large put position on a potential descent of atheneum’s price, not everyone is bearish on the asset. One Chinese miner Jiang Zhuoer took to social media to share his bullish executions of the cryptocurrency. Zhuoer says he expects ETH to lead the market bull run of 2023. In fact, the miner explains that ETH will actually begin to move before BTC. He also predicts that ethereum will soon break out of its six-month-long consolidation soon. 11/ I expect #Ethereum (ETH) to start rising earlier than #Bitcoin (BTC) as the leader of the next bull market.

This price increase sees it trading currently at a price of $1,311 with indicators pointing toward more upside, at least for the short term, as it moves above its 50-day moving average.

42413200,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl84VK,1673304089,Crypto Markets Today: Big Options Trade in Ether Market Would Profit from 69% Price Slide,"Last week, a buy order for 50,000 contracts of ether options – with a $400 strike price and expiring in June – appeared on Deribit's order book, raising alarm bells in the crypto community. As of press time, ether was priced around $1,300, so the options trade would pay off if the ether price slid 69% in less than six months. On Deribit, one ether options contract represents one ETH.  This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  ""On ether, the trade that made the most talk was the purchase of puts $400 on June 2023 made on-screen with a resting bid of [50,000] contracts,"" digital assets data provider Amberdata said in its weekly newsletter published Sunday.  A put option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market. A resting bid is an order whose price is away from the market and is yet to be executed.  As of early Monday, the order was partially filled for 40,000 contracts. The purchaser paid a premium of 0.0095 ETH per contract, amounting to a total outlay of 380 ETH or $494,000, according to data from Deribit.  Call and put option buyers pay a premium to sellers as compensation for offering protection against the bullish or bearish move. The premium is the maximum a buyer can lose if the market goes against their position. The profit potential is unlimited because, in theory, the market could see extreme bull runs or drop to zero.  The order might be an outright bearish bet aimed at profiting from a potential price crash. But it might also be a hedge taken against a bullish spot or futures market exposure in ether or other alternative cryptocurrencies. Most cryptocurrencies move in tandem with market leaders, bitcoin and ether.  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading at the $17,200 level, up 1.5% in the past 24 hours. BTC was trading as high as $17,390 in early afternoon trading hours (ET) before settling back to $17,210 as of publication time. Bitcoin's modest rally Monday has set off an explosive move higher in crypto-related stocks including Coinbase (COIN) and Marathon Digital (MARA). Equities closed mixed as investors navigated a big week with the releases of U.S. consumer price index (CPI) inflation data for December and the start of the fourth-quarter earnings report season.  Ether (ETH): The second-largest cryptocurrency recently had a 3.8% gain to trade at $1,320. The price has moved upward most of the day, trading as high as $1,344 in the early afternoon.  Solana (SOL): SOL recently rallied over 18% to trade around $16 Monday, breaking over the $14 resistance over the weekend reaching prices last seen in November. The price jump came as data from the on-chain tracker Artemis show daily active users of Solana increased by over 40% in the past two weeks.  Cardano’s (ADA): ADA spiked over 20% sometime Monday to trade as high as 34 cents before falling back to a 6% advance Monday afternoon. Activity on decentralized applications built on Cardano saw growth over the weekend, according to on-chain data.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: Falling Inflation Expectations Might Signal Bullish Turn for Bitcoin  By Glenn Williams Jr.  The reduction of inflation expectations is a welcome sign for crypto investors placing long bets on either asset.  The expected 5% increase in prices is fairly in line with top Federal Reserve officials' expectations for 2023 interest rate levels.  The narrower spread between price increases and rate levels will be important in stemming inflation. For comparison, the inflation rate in March 2022 was 8.5%, with a then-federal funds target rate of 0.25% to 0.50%.  For bitcoin and ether prices, the sooner the gap between inflation and the federal funds rate narrows, the sooner markets can begin to anticipate a move away from monetary tightening – the impact of which could result in additional price momentum for both.  Bitcoin and ether’s prices moved 0.39% and 0.74% higher, respectively, following the release of the data. Both assets were trading slightly higher prior to the announcement, but accelerated following the announcement.  Read the full technical take here.

Among the biggest gainers was FTT, the token of the crypto exchange that failed spectacularly in November, jumping 55% in the past 24 hours. (It’s still down 96% over the past year.)  Serum (SRM), the native token of the Solana-based decentralized exchange, surged 28% on the day.  ZIL, the Zilliqa blockchain project’s native token, increased 37%, while the native token of the Aptos blockchain, APT, known for its rocky launch and venture capital backing, gained 30%.  For comparison, the broad CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was up 2.8% over the past 24 hours.  The sudden surge caught traders off-guard betting on cryptocurrency prices to fall. In the past 24 hours, traders liquidated some $245 million of short positions, according to Coinglass data. Monday’s was the largest daily short liquidation since Nov. 10, when crypto exchange FTX’s agony before its ultimate demise stirred up price volatility in the crypto market.  The price action came after BTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, retook the $17,000 price level after trading in a range for three weeks, improving sentiment in the broad crypto markets.  Read more: Bitcoin's Modest Rally Sends Crypto-Related Stocks Sharply Higher  Alex Kruger, a popular crypto analyst on Twitter, told CoinDesk that exhausted sellers and thin liquidity fueled a relief rally for smaller tokens.  “Many altcoins saw strong year-end selling flows that were compounded by derivatives traders front-running such flows,” he said. “Then, shorts got squeezed.”  A signal of traders’ extreme bearish positioning before Monday’s price increase was the funding rates for perpetual swaps of solana (SOL) sinking to 1,000% annualized rate. Then SOL gained 20% and some $15 million of short bets were liquidated, according to Coinglass.  Historically, the surge of small-cap tokens and meme coins has been an ominous sign for market participants. Often it preceded local tops for crypto prices before a correction, as traders rotated their gains from top digital assets to small projects then dumped on the market.  However, Kruger predicted that the price recovery in crypto will continue, comparing the present conditions to early 2019 after the crypto market bottom, but the stellar run for altcoins might come to an end.  “The extraordinary outperformance relative to BTC and ETH should be gone, as funding rates finally reset to normal levels on Monday night.”  “This is still a bear market and traders would do well to exercise caution,” he added.",POSITIVE,BTC | FTT,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | FTT,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/09/beaten-down-ftt-serum-tokens-lead-altcoin-rally-triggering-short-squeeze,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5567dc867d7d60367666fdc9d9b3b868ed877c5c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) started the week in positive territory, up 1.5% and 4%, respectively, on higher than average volume.  The price increases occurred on a day in which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced U.S. consumer inflation expectations of 5% for December, versus expectations of 5.2%. The 5% reading marks the second consecutive month of declines, and the lowest reading since July of 2021. Bitcoin and ether prices continue to be impacted by Federal Reserve actions to slow inflation.  The reduction of inflation expectations is a welcome sign for crypto investors placing long bets on either asset.  The expected 5% increase in prices is fairly in line with top Fed officials' expectations for 2023 interest rate levels.  The narrower spread between price increases and rate levels will be important in stemming inflation.

Traditional markets were mixed on the data, with the Nasdaq composite trading higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 traded lower.

In what can be interpreted as self-fulfilling prophecy concerns, Cook stated, “If cost shocks and supply disruptions keep inflation elevated for a long enough period, households’ and firms’ inflation expectations could move higher – a development that could put additional upward pressure on inflation.”  In short, higher expected prices beget higher actual prices.  Tracking data since the onset of Fed tightening in March 2022, shows consumer inflation expectations taking a labored but steady trend downwards.  The largest decrease in expectations is attributable to gas, falling 5.9% over the prescribed time period. Food price expectations came in second, declining 2.2%  Ultimately, expectations for lower prices can lead to consumers delaying the purchase of goods, which can lead to lower prices, which could lead to increases in available capital to be invested in risk assets like bitcoin and ether.  Ether price trends  Ether has shown increased momentum over the most recent five days. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) has risen near 70. The RSI is a momentum indicator that can be used to identify both trends, as well as potential overbought/oversold conditions.  It ranges between 0-100, with 30 implying that an asset may be oversold and 70 indicating that an asset may be overbought. Ether has breached the upper range of its Bollinger Bands in four of the last six days. An asset reaches the upper range of Bollinger Bands, is often interpreted as a bullish signal.  Year to date, ether has outperformed bitcoin, rising 5.4% versus the asset.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/09/crypto-markets-analysis-falling-inflation-expectations-might-signal-bullish-turn-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23b772f1b042553da8224d031a1337af94f7f3ca-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Softer inflation data fuels risk-taking,"Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) perked up to a three-week high in Monday's trading after last week's jobs report fueled speculation that inflation has likely peaked and will continue to cool down. The world's largest altcoin ( ETH-USD ) gained 3.9% to $1.32K at 4:15 p.m. ET, bringing its market cap to $161.51B, according to CoinMarketCap data . Of course, ether's bounce was accompanied by a modest rally in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other major cryptos. Prospects for easing inflation was most recently highlighted by December's cooler-than-expected wages and softer jobs growth, in a sign that the Federal Reserve could continue to downshift its inflation-fighting interest-rate increases at upcoming FOMC meetings. That would be a positive for cryptos and other riskier assets hence the recent bullish price action. Fresh CPI data on Thursday is expected to show yet another month where headline inflation cooled. Economists are calling for a Y/Y rate of 6.5% in December vs. 7.1% in November and 9.1% at the July peak. Meanwhile, Jiang Zhuoer, CEO and co-founder of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining service B.TOP, contended that ether ( ETH-USD ), citing its deflationary coin supply, will ""start rising earlier than #Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as the leader of the next bull market,"" he wrote in a Twitter post .

However, Netcoins has significantly outperformed during November 2022, post the FTX collapse, with a 20% increase in its daily revenue. We decrease our price target to U.S.$0.35 (earlier U.S.$0.50) and reiterate our Buy rating. Singular Research Quarterly Summary – Q3:22 BIGG Digital (BBKCF) revenues down 42% vs. prior year to C$1.5 million versus C$2.6 million in Q3:21. The decrease was driven primarily by weakness in the Netcoins segment (down 54% YOY), partially offset by a strong performance in the Blockchain Intelligence Group ((BTGI)) segment (up 22% YOY). Netcoins revenue was C$1.0 million in Q3:22, down 54% YOY and down 43% QoQ due to the reduced trading volumes within the crypto market and lower cryptocurrency prices. However, Netcoins has significantly outperformed during November 2022, post the FTX collapse, with a 20% increase in its daily revenue. We believe this suggests that investors prefer fully regulated cryptocurrency exchange for their trading. Gross margin on Netcoins volume remained strong at 1.38% in Q3:22 (Q3:21 – 1.32%). Netcoins user base grew 5% QOQ in Q3:22. As of the end of September 2022, the total user base was 176k. Total ad spend decreased to C$0.46 million in Q3:22, compared to C$1.2 million in Q3:21. Customer acquisition costs remained in excess of $50 per user. Operating expenses were C$4.7 million for Q3:22, compared to C$6.3 million in Q3:21. The decrease was driven by lower advertising and promotion costs and a decrease in share-based compensation expenses. Net loss at C$(1.9) million in Q3:22, or C$(0.01) per diluted share, versus net income of C$1.0 million or C$0.00 per diluted share in Q3:21. Balance sheet . Cash and cryptocurrency in treasury (excluding restricted cash and customer deposits) equaled ~C$19.2 million as of September 30, 2022. In addition, BIGG also holds a C$8.3M investment in metaverse company TerraZero and a C$1.9M investment in Bitcoin mining company Luxxfolio. BIGG owns 250 Bitcoin, valued at approximately C$5.5 million. The company has no debt. Netcoins launched in the U.S. Subsequent to Q3:22, Netcoins launched its operations in the U.S. initially in five states - California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Virginia, and Missouri. The Company will then expand to additional states in H1:23. Valuation We value BBKCF using a blend of peer multiples and a DCF methodology. BBKCF’s valuation is challenging given its early stage and the limited number of publicly traded pure-play cryptocurrency companies. We believe the companies in the table below are the most relevant publicly traded peers for valuing BBKCF. We value BBKCF at 2.0x FY:25 sales of U.S.$26.3 million, which is at a slight discount to Coinbase ( COIN ) (due to its large size) but at a premium to the other peer group given its strong growth prospects and the fact that it is one of only a handful of Canada-based crypto trading platform to be fully regulated and publicly traded. In our view, investing in regulated trading platforms offers a lower-risk method of participating in the crypto economy versus investing directly in underlying cryptos. We discount the target price back at our computed cost of capital of 12.4%. We arrive at a peer group multiple-based target price of U.S.$0.19, which we discount back to U.S.$0.15. We weight the other 50% of our target using our Discounted Cash Flow target. Our DCF model uses our forecasted free cash flow to the firm over the first five years and then grows EBIT at a 20% rate over years six to eight and at 3% thereafter. We apply a weighted average cost of capital of 12.4%. Our DCF produces a value of U.S.$ 0.53 (or C$0.73). The combination of U.S.$0.15 at 50% and U.S.$0.53 at 50% results in a weighted average price target of U.S.$0.34, which we round up to U.S.$0.35 (or C$0.48).

The token moved independently during these periods, with larger cryptocurrencies barely catching up on this massive rally. Related Reading: This Sub-$1 Billion Crypto Is Leading Market Gains, Here’s The Reason As of this writing, GALA’s price trades at $0.04 with a 16% profit in the last 24 hours. Since late December 2022, the token has recorded a 194% rally and stands amongst the best-performing digital assets in the sector. Is the rally sustainable, or will the token retrace on its recent gains? GALA With More Room To Grow Data from analytics firm Santiment indicates that GALA was able to trend to the upside due to a spike in on-chain activity. An increase in whale activity supported the token’s price action and allowed it to push beyond resistance at $0.048. The last time GALA saw its current levels was in Q4, 2022. At that time, the cryptocurrency crashed behind a market-wide downtrend. The chart below shows that the spike in activity preceded the rally and suggests further appreciation. Santiment noted: Amongst the many surging altcoins in 2023, $GALA has been making a tremendous run. The price of the #Ethereum-based asset is up +194% since December 30th, and has exceed $0.048 for the first time since mid-September, backed by big whale transactions. Further data provided by Santiment indicate that GALA’s upside move was supported by negative overall market sentiment. As digital assets trended to the upside, sentiment went to a bearish extreme and hinted at a bounce to squeeze short positions. Santiment added: Altcoins have continued aggressively pumping throughout the weekend. As we have seen time and time again, markets move in the direction of the crowd’s unlikeliest expectation. NFT Gaming And Metaverse With Strong Long-Term Fundamentals The mini-altcoin season will continue if investors allocate capital to the NFT gaming and Metaverse sector. Coingecko records appreciation for similar projects, such as Decentraland (40%+), and The Sandbox (34%), in the previous seven days. In addition, at the Consumer Electronics Shows (CES) 2023, several companies and providers announced their Metaverse-related products.

Decreasing active addresses and entities demonstrate the diminishing level of interest in Bitcoin. Short- and medium-term conditions look to be a sustained period of chop. As we head into 2023, we want to highlight the latest state of Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) volume and volatility after a recent wave of capitulation. Last time we touched on these dynamics was in “ The Bitcoin Ghost Town ” in October, where we highlighted that an extremely low volume and low volatility period in Bitcoin price, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the options market was a concerning sign for the next leg lower. This played out in early November. Fast forward and the trends of declining volume and low volatility are back once again. Although this could be indicative of another leg lower to come in the market, it’s more likely indicative of a complacent and decimated market that few participants want to touch. Even during the November 2022 capitulation period, there was a historically low period of volatility. Sometimes the most market pain can be felt when having to wait for a clear change in trends. The Bitcoin price is providing that pain as we’ve yet to see the type of explosion in market volatility that has defined market pivots and major directional moves in the past. Bitcoin Magazine PRO While there are many different ways to define, classify and estimate Bitcoin volume in the market, they all show the same thing: September and November 2021 were the peak months of action. Since then, volume in both the spot and perpetual futures markets have been in steady decline. sjfremen Overall market depth and liquidity has also taken a major hit after the collapse of FTX ( FTT-USD ) and Alameda. Their destruction has led to a large liquidity hole, which is yet to be filled due to the lack of market makers currently in the space. By far, Bitcoin is still the most liquid market of any other cryptocurrency or “token,” but it’s still relatively illiquid compared to other capital markets since the whole industry has been crushed over the last few months. Lower market depth and liquidity means assets are prone to more volatile shocks as single, relatively large orders can have a greater impact on market price. Kaiko Q4 Report Kaiko Q4 Report On-Chain Apathy As expected in the current environment, we’re also seeing more market complacency when looking at on-chain data. Although continuing to rise over time, the number of active addresses — unique addresses active as either a sender or receiver — remain fairly stagnant over the last few months. The chart below highlights the 14-day moving average of active addresses falling below the running average over the last year. In previous bull market conditions, we’ve seen growth in active addresses outpace the existing trend fairly significantly. Bitcoin Magazine PRO Since address data has its flaws, looking at Glassnode’s data for active entities shows us the same trend. Overall, bear markets reversing are the result of many factors, including growth in new users and an increase in on-chain activity. Bitcoin Magazine PRO We can look at the moving averages of transfer volume across various time periods to see whether on-chain activity and momentum is increasing or decreasing relative to the trend. In past bear market cycles, on-chain activity begins to pick up relative to trend before the exchange rate recovery cycle is in full effect. Glassnode Today’s trend shows a diminishing level of on-chain transactional activity when comparing the 30-day and 365-day moving averages. While this is not to say that there is a certainty of lower prices and worsening conditions for the asset, it is saying that a meaningful change in trend has yet to occur. Lastly, we can look at the seller exhaustion constant metric , which takes the percentage of the Bitcoin supply in profit and multiplies it by the 30-day realized volatility. The metric’s name states its intention perfectly: an attempt to quantify when sellers may be exhausted, given low levels of profitability and historically low levels of volatility in tandem. Glassnode In our July 11 release “ When Will The Bear Market End? ”, we made the case that the brunt of the price-based capitulation had already been felt, while the real pain ahead was in the form of a time-based capitulation. “A look at previous Bitcoin bear market cycles shows two distinct phases of capitulation: “The first is a price-based capitulation, through a series of sharp selloffs and liquidations, as the asset draws down anywhere from 70 to 90% below previous all-time-high levels. “The second phase, and the one that is spoken of far less often, is the time-based capitulation, where the market finally begins to find an equilibrium of supply and demand in a deep trough.” We believe time-based capitulation is where we stand today. While exchange rate pressures can certainly intensify over the short term — given the macroeconomic headwinds that remain — the conditions that look likely to persist over the short and medium term look to be a sustained period of chop with extremely low levels of volatility that leave both traders and HODLers questioning when volatility and exchange rate appreciation will return. Market chop may be expected in the coming months, but this period of time-based capitulation has historically been a rare buying period for those with strong conviction in the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4568766-when-will-interest-in-bitcoin-return?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7313231.jpeg

7313097,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515401,1673290826,Is The Bitcoin Bottom In Yet? Here’s What aSOPR Metric Suggests,"A quant has explained using past trends of the Bitcoin adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) whether the current cycle has yet met all the bottom conditions. Bitcoin aSOPR EMAs Are Approaching Golden Cross As an analyst in a CryptoQuant post explained, the aSOPR EMAs are looking to form a golden cross soon. The “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR) indicates whether the average Bitcoin investor is selling at a profit or at a loss right now. The “Adjusted SOPR” (aSOPR) is a modified version of this metric that excludes from the data all selling done within an hour of first purchasing the coins. The advantage of doing this is that such short-term transactions are noise in the data and, thus, don’t have any significant implications on the market. When the value of this indicator is greater than 1, it means the holders are selling coins at some profit right now. On the other hand, values below the threshold suggest the overall market realizes some loss at the moment. Related Reading: This Week In Bitcoin And Crypto: Key Dates To Watch Naturally, the aSOPR being exactly equal to 1 implies that the investors are just breaking even on their current selling. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin aSOPR, as well as its 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) during the 2014-2015 and 2018-2019 bear markets: The trends in the metric during the previous bear market bottoms | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the quant marked the relevant zones for the indicator in the previous two cycles. It looks like the aSOPR hit bottom values below one and then caught an overall uptrend as the price of Bitcoin itself bottomed out in both cycles. The indicator hitting low levels under one like this suggests that the investors heavily capitulated then, which detoxed the market from weak hands and hence helped the price finally bottom out. Also, in both these bear markets, the 100-day EMA declined to the same lowest level (as represented by the lower dotted line in the chart) and rebounded back from it as this bottoming process took place. It also seems like a return to a bullish trend started with a golden cross of the two EMAs, with the 50-day crossing back above the 100-day. Related Reading: Ethereum 1-Month Realized Volatility Drops To Rare Level Seen Only Thrice In History Now, here is a chart that displays how the aSOPR and its EMAs are looking in the current cycle so far: The value of the metric seems to have been climbing recently | Source: CryptoQuant The chart shows that the same pattern of the Bitcoin aSOPR forming a bottom and then catching an overall uptrend has already appeared for the current cycle. The two EMAs are also looking on track to complete the golden cross soon. However, the analyst has pointed out that the 100-day EMA is yet to touch the dotted level in this cycle. The period spent so far in the recovery of the metric (the uptrend from the bottom) has also been only about half of what previous cycles saw (the yellow bars). Based on this, the quant believes there could still be one more drop in the price left, before these conditions are fulfilled and the real bottom is in.

More than $100 million in crypto was taken from the decentralized exchange after a trader used multiple accounts to buy, sell and hedge the price of the MNGO token.  Eisenberg later said he was part of a group that ""operated a highly profitable trading strategy"" and would return some of the funds to Mango. In later tweets he said he believed his actions were legal. The Justice Department arrested him roughly two months later on market manipulation charges.

Thorn told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Monday that the Web 3 sector, which is made up of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations, the metaverse and online gaming, were 31% of deals in 2022, while 13% were made up of trading platforms.  VCs invested more than $30 billion into crypto and blockchain startups in 2022, according to Galaxy's “Crypto VC Year End” report.  Thorn noted, however, that the number of deals and amount of money invested steadily declined every quarter during 2022, pointing out that macroeconomic factors coupled with the fall of significant crypto companies may have played a role in the decrease.  The firm found that more money is being invested in later-stage companies, especially those that provide trading and exchange services, he said.  “That makes some sense,” Thorn said, because “there are more later-stage companies than there were years ago.”  Thorn also said the U.S. “remains in the leading position” when it comes to crypto VC deals but said policymakers must establish regulations that don't stifle crypto innovation.

Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rose 2.5% to $17.53K at 12:57 p.m. ET, reaching the highest level seen since mid-December, and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) achieved a similar milestone , climbing 6.1% to $1.34K. The upswings spurred buying pressure across crypto-exposed stocks. Greenidge Generation Holdings ( NASDAQ: GREE ) +45.6% , Bitfarms ( NASDAQ: BITF ) +35.1% , Bit Digital ( NASDAQ: BTBT ) +29.1% , Marathon Digital Holdings ( NASDAQ: MARA ) +24.2% , Hut 8 Mining ( NASDAQ: HUT ) +23% , HIVE Blockchain Technologies +22.3% , and Riot Blockchain ( NASDAQ: RIOT ) +19.2% were among the biggest winners intraday. Crypto exchange Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ: COIN ) also saw its stock gap up 16.3% as Jefferies expects the company to weather the fallout from failed rival FTX ( FTT-USD ) over the longer term. With bank earnings, inflation data and remarks from Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell in focus this week, all three major U.S. indices were in the green, with Dow Jones +0.5% , S&P 500 +1% and tech-heavy Nasdaq +1.9% . The gains also come on the heels of an encouraging nonfarm payrolls report that showed cooler-than-expected wages and easing jobs growth. Cryptos typically rise during up days in the stock market and vice versa, though there have been a series of exceptions especially during periods of low volatility in crypto. The buying pressure seen in cryptos and stocks (and bonds for that matter) has prompted speculation on whether bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is showing signs of bottoming , as discussed by Seeking Alpha contributor Bing Ventures.

BlockFi filed for bankruptcy in November shortly after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  ""I think the important takeaway here is that there was no situation where insiders were pulling money off the platform on the eve of or anywhere near this bankruptcy file ... So this is not the Celsius case where management extracted value on the eve of the file,"" Joshua Sussberg, a partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis and representative for BlockFi, said during the second hearing in BlockFi's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Kirkland & Ellis also represents Celsius in that firm's bankruptcy.  Sussberg said BlockFi plans to file its assets and liabilities, along with a statement of financial affairs on Wednesday, which BlockFi later confirmed on Twitter. Shortly after the first hearing in November, the company kicked off a sale process and has reached out to ""106 domestic and international potential buyers for some or all of the business,"" Sussberg's presentation said. The company plans to ask for court approval of bidding procedures at a Jan. 30 hearing.  Sussberg also pointed to around $15 million in withdrawals by five members of the management team, including $6 million by CEO Zac Prince, that were categorized as ""litigation settlement payment"" or tax payments routed through executives.  No member of the BlockFi management team withdrew any cryptocurrency from the platform after Oct. 14, and no member made a withdrawal greater than 0.2 bitcoin (BTC) in value after Aug. 17, Sussberg said during the hearing.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael B. Kaplan also denied a motion by BlockFi, requesting the turnover of Robinhood Markets (HOOD) shares that FTX had pledged to BlockFi as collateral for a loan.  “At this juncture, it's clear that this court is not in a position to enter any turnover order of any type. The shares are being held by the government pursuant to a warrant of seizure, and the government is not a party to the pending adversary proceeding,” Kaplan said during the hearing before denying the motion.

Good money is something that can’t be debased like Gold, silver, and Bitcoin. On the other hand, bad money can be easily debased or can be created very easily.

The recipient of a number of downgrades and price target cuts to start the year, crypto exchange Coinbase is higher by 15% today and now up nearly 25% from an all-time low hit earlier in 2023.  With most of the miners having begun the year priced as if they will follow peers Core Scientific (CORZ) and Argo Blockchain (ARBK) into either bankruptcy protection or some other form of restructuring, bitcoin's modest advance is having a big effect on Monday. Marathon is higher by 24% and the company formerly known as Riot Blockchain, Riot Platforms (RIOT), is up 18.5%. Hut 8 (HUT), Hive Blockchain (HIVE), and Bit Digital (BTBT) are all ahead more than 20%. While up just 4.6% Monday, Argo has quadrupled in value since agreeing to a bailout from Galaxy Digital (BRPHF).  While the moves seem impressive, all of the above names have suffered declines above 80% over the past year, so today's gains hardly amount to a blip on a longer-term chart.  As for bitcoin, it had been flatlining in the mid-$16,000 area since early December, but has managed to claw its way to $17,300 at press time, up about 5% for 2023.

GALA is right at the top of the list of gainers for the past 24 hours, surpassing second-place Zilliqa (ZIL) by a considerable margin. Why Is GALA Pumping So Much? In the early hours of Monday, Gala Games took to Twitter to announce a new partnership. The blockchain gaming company which had been working on its film projects revealed that it had gotten movie stars Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Mark Wahlberg to star in its film. But this was not the only bullish development of the company. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Start 2023 With Accumulation Trend That Could Be Bullish For ADA Another revelation from the Twitter post was that moviegoers would be able to scan a QR code on a purchased ticket to claim a digital item that is being sold on different marketplaces. Furthermore, Gala Games also put another use case where QR codes could pop up to claim an item while viewers were watching a movie on a streaming platform such as Netflix. “That item has been selling on OpenSea so why wouldn’t you at least take a look?” the announcement said. The GALA token fits into all of this by being the gas token of Gala Film, which is the blockchain that powers the film arm. These items from the movies are not limited to Gala users, so individuals who want to claim items from the scanned QR codes will need to purchase GALA tokens to use as gas fees; therefore increasing the demand for the cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency has been trading heavily since the sector took another dive into its current levels, but there is light at the of the tunnel. Related Reading: Top 5 Crypto To Watch As CPI Data Is Released This Week Cardano (ADA) trades at $0.32, with a 12% rally in the last 24 hours. Over the previous week, the token records a 29% profit and stands as the best-performing crypto asset for this period. Other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 are seeing similar price action. Cardano Will Take Over Higher Spots In Top 10 By Market Cap According to a pseudonym Cardano bull, the cryptocurrency is underpriced. The token has suffered along with other risks on assets due to tighter macroeconomic conditions. Despite the downside trend, ADA remained one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Cardano first entered this ranking in late 2021, at the high of the previous crypto bullish cycle. At that time, the company behind its development introduced a series of improvements and rollout smart contract capabilities on the platform. These improvements made Cardano compatible with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and took it to the top of several metrics, including monthly contributions from developers. The ADA ecosystem bloomed. Two weeks ago, as NewsBTC reported, there was another spike in Cardano’s on-chain activity. These metrics support ADA’s bullish thesis as they hint at seller exhaustion following a massive downtrend and substantial accumulation from mid to large investors, as seen in the chart below. The pseudonym analyst wrote the following about ADA’s future and its potential to see further profits: (…) I believe that’s where it fairly belongs. Socials drive crypto value and this is the 3rd largest community, at least. The 2020-22 VC driven TPS, TVL, ponzinomics psyops are coming to an end. Cardano will assume its rightful place. ADA Out Of The Crypto Top 10 By Market Cap? On the other hand, ADA’s detractors posted their 2023 predictions for the token. Crypto personality Eric Wall forecasted that ADA would “finally drop” from the top 10 by market cap. Related Reading: Ethereum 1-Month Realized Volatility Drops To Rare Level Seen Only Thrice In History The Cardano community rejected the prediction; some believe ADA will exit the general group and enter the top 3, thus fulfilling the prophecy. While others have different expectations and, while bullish on ADA, acknowledge the ranking fluctuations. One User wrote: Can’t pretend it’s not possible (for Cardano to exit the top 10).

42413184,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl84HI,1673278597,Signature Bank Downgraded at Jefferies Due to Shrinking Crypto Business,"Signature Bank’s (SBNY) management’s decision to shrink its digital asset deposits business is understandable given the recent turmoil in the cryptocurrency industry, but the negative impact on net interest margin (NIM) and and net interest income (NII) is being underappreciated, Jefferies' Ken Usdin said in a report Monday.  Usdin downgraded SBNY to hold from buy, and slashed its price target to $124 from $185. The rating and price target cuts come after the stock’s 67% tumble from year-ago levels. Shares are down marginally to $116 in early action on Monday.  Shrinking crypto deposits by $8 billion to $10 billion and replacing them with wholesale borrowings costing around 4.25% will drive a significant reset in net interest margin in the coming quarters, said Usdin. While management plans to pay down some borrowings with core deposit growth, it will take some time for the bank’s other businesses to generate that growth, according to his report.  Signature in early December said that it planned to shrink its deposits tied to cryptocurrencies, signaling a move away from the digital asset industry for the bank.

42394481,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw8KkD,1673278024,Non-Fungible Terms: NFT Lingo Every Collector Should Know,"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have grown in popularity over the past few years, creating subcultures and pockets of passionate collectors. As these communities have expanded, so too has the terminology used to describe different people, projects and trading behaviors within the NFT space.  Those who are new to NFTs may come across colloquialisms popularized by NFT traders on social media. If you're just starting your ""sniping"" journey, here are the terms you should know to better understand the NFT market.  The ultimate beginner-friendly NFT glossary  Airdrop: Cryptocurrencies or NFTs deposited into a person's private crypto wallet for free. NFT projects often give airdrops to pre-existing community members or those who complete various tasks on social media.  Alpha: Refers to exclusive information on an NFT project that could give traders a competitive advantage. Alpha groups are typically created to share exclusive information amongst themselves.  Allowlist: A list of wallet addresses compiled by an NFT project before minting that guarantees certain people a spot. This is sometimes also referred to as a “whitelist,” though that term has been largely phased out.  AMA: Short for ""Ask Me Anything."" NFT creators usually host these question-and-answer sessions on social media platforms such as Twitter, Discord or Reddit.  Ape: To ""ape” into an NFT project means to buy a token shortly after launch without doing thorough research. Alternatively, ""APE"" could refer to the Ethereum-based ApeCoin token that powers the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem.  Axie: A playable NFT character in Sky Mavis' popular blockchain-based game ""Axie Infinity.""  BAYC: Shorthand for the popular NFT collection ""Bored Ape Yacht Club"" created by Yuga Labs in 2021. Other projects in the BAYC ecosystem feature similar abbreviations, including Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC).  Blue chip: A term used to describe top-tier NFT projects that are expected to be stable and profitable in the long term.  Burn: To ""burn"" an NFT means to take that particular token out of circulation by placing it in a wallet that no one can access. NFTs might be burned in exchange for a physical good or as an upgrade to an existing NFT.  CryptoKitties: Released in 2017 by Dapper Labs, CryptoKitties was one of the first successful NFT games on the Ethereum blockchain. Demand for CryptoKitties was so high at one time that it caused significant congestion on the underlying Ethereum blockchain.  Curated NFT marketplace: A platform that sells NFTs that have been selected by the platform and have undergone extensive screening. A few examples of curated NFT markets include SuperRare and Nifty Gateway.  Degen: Slang for “degenerate.” Refers to an NFT trader that jumps into buying tokens out of speculation.  Diamond hands: Refers to holding on to a digital asset such as an NFT no matter how strong the pressure is to sell, with the hope that it will be worth more later on.  Drop: An NFT ""drop” refers to the date when an NFT collection becomes available for minting on a blockchain.  ENS: Short for ""Ethereum Name Service."" These are NFT domain names that help create simplified and personalized Ethereum wallet addresses ending in "".eth"" which replace long strings of random numbers and letters.  ERC-20: The token standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.  ERC-721: A token standard on the Ethereum blockchain for NFTs that allows for basic functionality to track and transfer NFTs.  ERC-1155: Sometimes called the multi-token standard, ERC-1155 is an updated version of the code for ERC-721. It allows for batch transfers and can include a combination of fungible, non-fungible and semi-fungible tokens.  Flip: A term to describe buying or minting an NFT for a low price and quickly selling for a profit on the secondary market.  Floor price: The lowest price a buyer is willing to pay for an NFT in a given collection. It is often used as an indicator of a collection’s popularity, though the floor price can be manipulated by holders of a project to make it seem more valuable.  Fractional NFTs: Taking an NFT and dividing it into smaller pieces, allowing multiple people to invest in a given digital asset. The process involves creating fungible (ERC-20) tokens that are tied to the underlying non-fungible (ERC-721) tokens.  Fungible: Refers to the ability for a token to be interchanged with another token. Non-fungible, on the other hand, refers to a token that cannot be replicated.  Gas fees:A blockchain transaction fee paid to network validators when an NFT is traded.  Generative art: An art style that uses autonomous systems or algorithms to randomly generate content. More recently, it has gained popularity among collectors and creators of NFTs through platforms like Art Blocks.  Gm/gn: Short for “good morning” and “good night,” the terms are frequently used as a greeting between NFT traders on social media.  HODL: The origin of HODL came from a typo of ""hold"" but has also become an acronym for “Hold on for Dear Life.” It's a term of encouragement used among traders to promote holding on to NFTs no matter the market conditions.  JPEG: Short for ""joint photographic experts group."" It’s a standard format for digital images that is often used for art NFTs.  Liquidity: Refers to the ability to trade your NFT for cash.  Metaverse: Immersive, virtual worlds that often utilize NFTs.  Metadata: A set of data that describes the characteristics of an NFT. It often includes the description, total supply, traits and creation date of an NFT.  Mint: Turning a digital file into an NFT by publishing it on the public ledger of a blockchain. This process helps convert art, video or audio files into verifiable NFT collectibles.  Mooning: A slang term for when an NFT or crypto asset is quickly rising in value.  Music NFTs: A type of NFT linked to an audio file.  Non-curated NFT marketplace: Also called ""open NFT marketplaces,"" these are sites where anyone can buy, bid and mint NFTs. A few examples of open NFT marketplaces include OpenSea, Rarible and LooksRare.  One-of-one (1:1): Refers to an NFT that is unique and only offered as a single edition.  Open Edition: Refers to an NFT that can be minted in unlimited quantities within a set timeframe.  OpenSea: Launched in 2017, it is one of the largest NFT marketplaces.  PFP: Shorthand for both ""profile picture"" and “picture for proof.” The term refers to the use of NFT avatars as one’s profile picture on social media. Many collections, including CryptoPunks, were created in this style, and often come in batches of 10,000 NFTs with different rarity traits.  Play-to-earn: A category of blockchain games that uses NFTs to represent in-game assets. Also sometimes called ""GameFi.""  RTFKT: Pronounced ""artifact,"" RTFKT is a London-based studio that gained mainstream attention after the sports apparel brand Nike bought it in 2021. RTFKT is best known for its sneaker NFTs and its PFP collection CloneX.  Rug Pull: Refers to a common scam in the crypto space where the creators of a project will heavily promote it and then disappear with investor money.  Royalties: Fees denominated as a percentage paid to the creator of an NFT project every time an NFT is sold.  Sniping: A term used to describe methods for finding an NFT that is listed below its actual value.  Sweeping: Also called ""sweeping the floor."" Refers to buying numerous NFTs in a collection, often at the project’s floor price, in the hope that it will raise the project's value.  Smart contract: A program stored on the blockchain that automatically executes when certain conditions are met without the need for an intermediary. NFTs are minted through smart contracts, which can assign ownership and transfer ownership when the NFT is sold.  Soulbound tokens: A non-transferable NFT linked to an individual’s identity.  Traits: The various features that distinguish NFTs within a collection. NFT collectors often sort NFTs by attributes to determine their rarity and value. For example, only nine CryptoPunks are aliens – therefore, CryptoPunks with alien traits tend to be more expensive than CryptoPunks with human traits.  Tokenize: Taking a real-world, tangible asset and converting it into digital form for trading. Things such as land deeds and physical goods can be tokenized via NFTs.  Utility NFTs: Refers to NFTs that offer real-world perks or experiences. For example, some NFTs double as tickets to music events or access to private social media channels.  WAGMI: Short for “We All Gonna Make It,"" an optimistic term used in the NFT space. Conversely, NGMI is short for “Not Going to Make It” and refers to a pessimistic outlook on an NFT project.  Wash trading: Refers to the buying and selling of an NFT between two buyers who are the same or are colluding together in order to manipulate trading data.  Wearable NFTs: Refers to clothing or accessories sold as NFTs that can be worn by playable avatars in blockchain-based games.

Since January 1st, the total market cap of crypto rose by 8.25% which shows a complete reversal of investor sentiment on the market. As market optimism grows for an economic soft landing, crypto is poised for a recovery after a year of complete disaster. The market was devastated after multiple high-profile collapses, leaving investors as the biggest losers and driving fear, uncertainty, and doubt higher. The broader financial market is eyeing the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for December. These Are The Top 5 Crypto To Watch This Week: Litecoin (LTC) The ol’ reliable token of the crypto world, this altcoin recently recorded its 140 millionth transaction. Litecoin accomplished that with nearly a 100% uptime, which is a rare occurrence in an era of smart contract providers. The altcoin is also growing in adoption with LTC gaining traction as a means for payment. With this in mind, LTC would definitely have a strong and significant role once the bear market cycle starts. At the current price of $81.92, the token will have a significant part in the next bull market. However, if macroeconomic data trends down or stagnate, LTC will definitely have a tough time climbing back up. Shiba Inu. Image: WBUR Shiba Inu (SHIB) The original rival to Dogecoin (DOGE), this memecoin has grown in popularity and utility and makes it to our top 5 crypto list. The Shiba Inu community is also trying to distance itself from its memecoin origins which is more apparent as one reads the details of the Shibarium upgrade. At the current market market price of $0.00000887, SHIB has some wiggle room for growth as Shibarium’s launch nears. But investors and traders should pay attention to macroeconomic trends because of the token’s high correlation with Bitcon and Ethereum. Related Reading: IMX Spikes 10% In Last 24 Hours – Will It Start The Week Strong? Polygon (MATIC) Polygon’s native token MATIC has been pumping in price since Mastercard announced its partnership with the ecosystem for its Web3 Artist Acceleration Program. Recent migrations of y00ts and DeGods would also contribute to this bullish action. With MATIC trading at $0.865, any good development macro-wise would mean big gains for the token’s investors and traders. Image: Cryptocurrency News Bitcoin (BTC) Of course, Bitcoin will always be in the top 5 crypto roster. As Bitcoin stands at $17,252, the king crypto leads the charge for recovery against the bear market. BTC holders are especially bullish on the 4-year cycle that the top cryptocurrency followed during past bear markets. Although the token lost its status as an alternative to gold, the coin breaking the $17k resistance is a significantly bullish signal for investors and traders to watch for. With Bitcoin being correlated with almost the entire crypto market, any movements by BTC would mean gains or losses for the entire market.

However, with the release of Bonk, SOL has been going up in the past week and rounds up the top 5 crypto list for today. Bonk is the new memecoin that created buzz around it as it pumped by 1,600% in the past week. This led to a spike in network activity, thus pushing the price of Solana upwards as well. But with Bonk’s big pump, a correction might also hurt SOL.

Ethereum 1-Month Realized Volatility Has Plummeted To Just 39.8% As per data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the month of December 2022 was historically quiet for both Ethereum and Bitcoin. The “realized volatility” is an indicator that measures the standard deviation of daily returns from the mean for the market in question. The indicator is usually taken over a rolling window, with the one-week and one-month versions being generally the most useful timespans for it. In the context of the current discussion, the relevant metric is the one-month realized volatility. When the value of the metric is high, it means the asset’s price has been showing greater fluctuations from the average recently. Such a trend implies that the market is providing a high trading risk currently. On the other hand, low values suggest returns haven’t deviated much from the mean, and hence that the price has been stuck in stale consolidation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Depositing Transactions At 4-Year Low, Bottom Signal? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the one-month Ethereum realized volatility over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric has declined in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum one-month realized volatility has plunged to just 39.8% recently, suggesting that the past month has had very little diversity in day-to-day returns. This current level of the indicator is actually a historically low value, and as is apparent from the chart, there have only been three instances in the history of the crypto where the price has been this stable. Related Reading: This Week In Bitcoin And Crypto: Key Dates To Watch Interestingly, after each occurrence of the volatility hitting these lows, the price has made a sharp move and the indicator has jumped back up. An important example of this was back in November 2018, when the value of ETH collapsed toward the bottom of the bear market in a sudden move, after the metric had reached these rare levels. Glassnode also points out that, just like for Ethereum, the one-month realized volatility for Bitcoin has also plunged to historical lows recently, as the below chart highlights. The value of the metric seems to have hit very low values recently | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As you can see above, the Bitcoin one-month realized volatility has only been lower than the current value (24.6%) a few times in the entire history of the crypto. A notable instance here was also in November 2018, where, just like ETH, BTC crashed down to form its bottom. If these historical trends are anything to consider, then the current extremely low values in the one-month volatility for Ethereum and Bitcoin could mean both the cryptos may soon see a significant spike in the metric soon, but the accompanying price move could be toward either direction.

The broker initiated coverage of the stock with a hold rating and a $35 price target. The rating comes after rival broker Cowen downgraded the shares, which slumped 86% last year, to market perform from outperform on Thursday, citing a lack of clarity on a possible recovery in trading volumes following the collapse of FTX. Coinbase shares rose 14% in early trading to $37.94.  “The fallout from FTX has called into question the safety, security and legitimacy of the broader crypto ecosystem,” the report said, worsening an already difficult operating environment, as retail trading volumes slumped along with crypto prices.  Coinbase will be “acutely pressured in the near term” as its retail customer base trades less frequently in the bear market, but the company has staying power due to its healthy balance sheet with over $5 billion in cash, it's proactive approach to regulatory compliance, prudent risk management and its legitimacy as a publicly listed and audited company, the note said.  The competitive landscape will be less crowded for Coinbase post-FTX, but Jefferies still expects a top-line miss in the fourth quarter due to lower retail trading volumes. The company is likely to report fourth-quarter results toward the end of February, based on previous patterns.

7302233,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515374,1673272826,Cosmos (ATOM) Jumps Over 12% In One Day As Market Recovers,"Cosmos traded in a highly volatile crypto market in 2022, but 2023 is showing signs of recovery. CoinMarketCap shows that the global crypto market cap has increased in 24 hours. The trading volume of cryptocurrencies in the market has also increased within 24 hours. This data proves that there is still much global interest in cryptocurrencies. According to a poll conducted on Twitter, 53.8 % of participants see the early part of 2023 to be bullish. In contrast, 46.2% predict a bearish market trend for early 2023. However, Twitter user Neon Panda states that these predictions are speculative since crypto is complicated. Related Reading: IMX Spikes 10% In Last 24 Hours – Will It Start The Week Strong? Cosmos (ATOM), ranked number 20 on the crypto market list, has shown signs of a recovery in its price today, January 9. Cosmos has benefitted from this improved market outlook as its native token ATOM is also in the green today. The price change in 24 hours is $1.24, a 12.34% increase. This increment reflects in the trading volume of the asset, which is up by 265.39% How Long Will Cosmos (ATOM) Ride The Bullish Trend? ATOM is currently on a bullish trend at the start of the year. The formation of longer green candles shows that the bulls have the upper hand in the market. The asset has broken out of the sideways trend and has continued to rise on the chart. Its support level of $8.441 held as the price increased. Atom will face resistance at $14.458 and $15.817. However, since these levels are below its all-time high of $44.70, it remains a possibility. The asset is trading above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA). It implies that both the short-term and long-term sentiments are currently bullish. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is giving off similar signals with the reading at 75.87, which is in the overbought region. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also bullish. The MACD is above its signal line, which is a buy signal. It implies that ATOM might continue its price increase in the coming weeks without negative occurrences. However, note that if a digital asset falls by 50%, it would need to recover by 100% to return to its previous price. This feat might be complex to accomplish for altcoins. Also, investors should consider that altcoins are more volatile than large-cap cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. What Is Driving Cosmos (ATOM)’ Resurgence? Although the crypto market has shown signs of recovery, it is still largely volatile. Several factors are responsible for a price change of a digital asset in the crypto market. Cosmos (ATOM) is enjoying a price resurgence due to increased trading activity, according to data from CoinGecko. The Cosmos Network seeks to serve as a bridge connecting other blockchains to communicate seamlessly. Also, the provision of regular upgrades on the network, such as Web3 solutions, has helped its popularity. On the Cosmos network, blog users receive regular updates about events. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Up Nearly 20%, Aiming For A Higher High? Cosmos has a community with a rich following where information and communication remain a priority.

42411270,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMaCt,1673272800,CoinDesk Research’s 2022 Annual Crypto Review,"As with all financial assets, market performance is usually the first thing that comes to mind when considering a “year in review.” Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) followed a blistering-hot 2021 with a 65% and 67% pullback in 2022.  As for macro assets, their correlation behavior with bitcoin remains an unfinished story. Only bonds ended the year within an uncorrelated band to bitcoin while stock indices maintained a somewhat positive correlation, and the U.S. dollar index maintained a somewhat negative correlation.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  These market performance difficulties leaked into bitcoin mining companies as a perfect storm of headwinds led most of the publicly traded bitcoin mining companies to cede an immense amount of value. Of the five largest public bitcoin miners measured by bitcoin hashrate, the best performer was CleanSpark, which still lost 79%. Bitcoin’s hashrate marched steadily upward as mining machines purchased in the throes of the bull market came online. That, combined with poor bitcoin price performance, led to general difficulties in the mining industry.  That said, the amount of venture funding raised by blockchain and crypto companies increased in 2022, almost touching $30 billion. While the growth was far slower than it was in 2021, there was still plenty of venture capital invested as the venture funds that raised funds in 2021 needed to deploy that dry powder in 2022.  In the year of the bear market, we can find solace in the technology that continued to develop. The talk of the town for Ethereum was the successful implementation of the Merge, which moved the second-biggest blockchain from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ticked along, with more nodes enforcing 2021’s Taproot upgrade while adding some exciting potential use cases to the Lightning Network – its commerce layer – through growth of the network and the announcement of Taro by Lightning Labs.  Meanwhile, it was a strange year in the world of policy. While massive legislative efforts such as the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill have crept closer to becoming law, few nations have actually implemented any new laws providing broad clarity for the treatment of digital assets. However, the massive failures in 2022 are likely to create new pressure for regulators to actually do something about the sector.  From a regulatory perspective, we’ve seen a majority of Ethereum transactions comply with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) unit of the U.S. Treasury Department, which blacklisted the Tornado Cash mixer program in August and, in turn, led to one of its developers, Alexey Pertsev, being arrested.  Of course, any discussion of crypto in 2022 would be incomplete without discussing our first proper crypto credit crisis, which began with a glut of crypto lenders promising yield to customers in exchange for deposits and culminated with the arrest in the Bahamas and extradition to the U.S. of FTX and Alameda Research founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). It was years in the making and it’s hardly the first credit crisis in financial history, but this one is definitively crypto’s.

7301494,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515371,1673271650,Ripple (XRP) Related Flare Network Token Airdrop: FLR dumps by 71%,"In late 2020, the Flare Network attracted a lot of attention in the Ripple (XRP) community. The creators wanted to open up the DeFi space for Ripple and announced an airdrop of Flare (FLR) tokens for all XRP holders. However, holders of XRP had to be patient for a long time. The launch was postponed several times. But today is finally the day: at 6:59 p.m. EST, the distribution of FLR tokens will take place. The FLR Token Distribution event is just 24 hours away. Join the #Flare team and guests on Twitter tomorrow. The distribution starts at 23:59 UTC sharp. The stream will start a few minutes before.#ConnectEverything pic.twitter.com/CLtmUird1Z — Flare ☀️ (@FlareNetworks) January 8, 2023 However, there is also bad news. Just before the launch, the FLR/USDT trading pair is seeing a massive dump of around 71% on Bitrue. The exchange was the only trading platform besides Poloniex to date where FLR could be traded as an IOU. As can be seen in the 1-day chart from TradingView, the FLR/USDT pair has seen a massive dip over the last two days on Bitrue. The token was trading at $0.5394 yesterday and crashed to a low of $0.1559 at times today before recovering to $0.2395 at press time. With this, the FLR token is still posting a loss of around 55% compared to two days ago. Airdrop For XRP Holders Is Finally Here – Too Late? When the project started, the narrative was clear: Ripple (XRP) lacked access to the booming sector of decentralized finance (DeFi). This has since changed, at least in part. Ripple has been developing a bridge to Ethereum (ETH) on its own to enable smart contracts and DeFi. Moreover, the XRP Ledger now has a DEX and its own NFT standard. Related Reading: XRP Price Primed For Future Rally Following Ripple’s MENA Expansion To adapt to it, the project now aims to provide smart contract capabilities for blockchains without them, starting with Ripple (XRP). Flare Network is a layer 1 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based interoperable blockchain based on the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Related Reading: XRP Whales Move Assets As Price Dips, What’s Next? However, whether Flare Network can convince investors after its 2-year delay with its new approach or whether there will be another dump tonight when the majority of Ripple (XRP) investors receive their FLR tokens, remains to be seen. Today’s dump suggests that some investors may not be interested in FLR in the long term. FLR Token Distribution For every 1 XRP in the snapshot (taken in December 2020), 1.0073 FLR will be airdropped. Today, the first 15% of this amount will be distributed via airdrop. The remaining 85% of the tokens will be paid out in 36 monthly installments. The method of distribution depends on the outcome of the community vote on the Flare Improvement Proposal 01 (FIP.01). If the community approves the proposal, the remaining 36 monthly distributions will be decentralized on the chain. The tokens will be divided among the wallets that packaged FLR tokens (WFLR). If the community rejects the proposal, the same self-storage wallets and the same centralized exchanges that received the initial airdrop will receive one airdrop per month for 36 months.

While the crypto company’s bankruptcy case could take years, the estate has prioritized the sale of LedgerX, FTX Japan, FTX Europe and stock-clearing platform Embed, arguing they are the easiest to separate and have a risk of losing value if not sold quickly.  As of Sunday, “approximately 117 parties, including various financial and strategic counterparties globally, have expressed interest to the debtors [FTX] in a potential purchase of one or more of the businesses,” said a legal declaration by Kevin Cofsky, a partner at Perella Weinberg, the investment bank hired by FTX Group to represent the collapsed crypto company.  FTX has entered into 59 confidentiality agreements so far, Cofsky said. LedgerX, a derivatives arm of FTX US and one of the few companies in the empire to remain solvent, leads the pack with 56 expressions of interest.  The U.S. Trustee, a branch of the Department of Justice (DOJ) responsible for bankruptcy cases, protested on Saturday that the deal would need to safeguard user privacy and that there should be no sale of potentially valuable assets where there were serious allegations of wrongdoing.  In a reply posted Sunday, FTX said it wouldn’t sell off any claims linked to Sam Bankman-Fried, Gary Wang, Nishad Singh, Caroline Ellison or their families, given allegations made against those former senior executives by the DOJ, alongside securities and commodity regulators.  The deadline for submitting initial bids for the four companies are set to expire between Jan. 18 and Feb. 1. But, in a further Sunday filing, a committee representing FTX’s creditors said they “cautiously agree” to proceed with the sale, but added it couldn’t see the case to rush.

According to tracking by CoinGecko, IMX was up 10% in the daily timeframe with its biggest gain at the weekly timescale at nearly 19%. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Is Now 4th Most Popular Cryptocurrency On BitPay IMX: What Drove Prices Up? Although the past year saw the token drop by 87%, it also saw some significant developments for the L2 ecosystem. For their push to become the leading competitor in the NFT space, Gamestop partnered with ImmutableX for their NFT marketplace. This placed ImmutableX on the spotlight as it was just a startup company back then. Both companies also created a $100 million fund for NFT developers to boost their projects if granted. The partnership created buzz around the time as this sort of legitimized NFTs in the eyes of gamers and collectible enthusiasts as NFTs sought an audience with this crowd of consumers. Image: CoinJournal But with NFT interest dwindling, the technology will continually be a hard-sell to consumers as it is still in its infancy. The real growth, however, is in the GameFi space. According to ImmutableX, the ecosystem edged Polygon in terms of exclusive on-chain GameFi development with ImmutableX catching up on cross-chain development. These developments are also courtesy of Immutable’s previous wins. Most notable of these is the $200 million that they raised during its Series C funding with gaming industry companies and venture funds. IMX Riding Bullish Momentum ImmutableX’s native token IMX seems to be riding the bullish wave that’s taken over major cryptos Bitcoin and Ethereum. As of writing, the two are up 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively. This is a good wave for IMX to ride on. However, this manifests a very real risk of a huge correction if macroeconomic indicators show a worsening economic situation. But with the White House announcing that the economy is heading for a soft landing, investor sentiment should reverse back to positive on both stocks and riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Ethereum Classic (ETC) Price Balloons To Nearly 30% In Last 7 Days Crypto total market cap at $810 billion on the weekend chart | Chart: TradingView.com For IMX to continue its bullishness, the token needs to break its sideways movement that formed because of FTX’s collapse. The primary resistance level at $0.4726 should be broken as this was the main resistance that kept the price downwards. With major cryptos going bullish, IMX riding the wave to break through this resistance can help it turn $0.4726 to support. Investors and traders, however, should keep watch as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be released this week.

Alongside it is Cardano (ADA) following suit in the same direction of the upward movement. ADA has spiked by over 15% in the last 24 hours, following the coin’s recent cheerful news, including the DeFi TVL tapping a two-month high and the co-founder Charles Hokingson announcing an upcoming launch of a hospital that will accept ADA as a payment method in February. Cardano (ADA) Rally In The Past Weeks The ending of last year brought some not-so-confident positivity to ADA traders; the coin was bleeding red regardless of the positive news. However, over the past few weeks, Cardano has been printing a bullish trend, and looking at the chart, there was evidence of some accumulation of liquidity. Even market analytics platform Santiment reported at the end of December that ADA was undervalued, given the indicated whale accumulation and bear exhaustion. Sentiment noted sharks and whales hold 100,000 to 10 million ADA and are still actively accumulating. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Leads Gains Among Top Coins, Is It Set To $0.50? ADA began the year with a trading price of about $0.24, and following its rally to the upside a few days ago, ADA climbed above $0.3 by last week Monday, spiked to $0.34, and currently trades at $0.3283. The weekend was warming up the process of the nearly 20% spike, which happened today. Yesterday saw ADA taking all the liquidity on the upside and climbing over every higher high. Though it’s hard to say for sure if this rally is the road heading to a bull run, the chart indicates a retracement sooner or later. The Crypto Market Bullish Trend Overview ADA hasn’t been the only altcoins printing bullish trends. The largest coins by market cap, including Ethereum, Solana, and Binance coin BNB, have so far been seeing an uptrend. The top coin, Bitcoin, has made some significant movement breaking free from the $16,000 zone and currently trading above the $17,000 region. ADA and Solana (SOL) still happen to emerge as the highest gainers among top cryptocurrencies by market cap. SOL went from the $10 – $13 zone and skyrocketed by 13%, with a current market price of $16.3 at the time of writing. With the Shanghai update somewhere around the corner, Ethereum (ETH) was not left out in the bullish trend. ETH climbed above $1,300 after the prolonged stagnation in the $1,200 region. ETH increased by 4% in the last 24 hours, with a current trading price of $1,316 at the time of writing. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Climbs Above $1,300, Is This A Clear Bullish Signal Bitcoin gained a few hundred dollars in its value.

Miners have been cutting back their power use at times of high demand for energy, selling the electricity back to the grid, in order to cope with market headwinds that have seen some of the biggest names in the industry filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  Hive uses a mix of computers purpose-built for bitcoin mining, known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), and general purpose graphics processing units (GPU) to mine other tokens. The miner converts the alt-coins to bitcoin after mining them.  Hive's production was down about 20%, or 50 BTC, month on month. But the difference was more than made up by Hive's grid balancing activities, according to its December update, released on Monday.  Hive stock was up 2.2% on pre-market trading on the day, along with the broader crypto market.  The mining company also deployed the first machines that it has designed itself using Intel's (INTC) Blocksale chips. Hive installed 1,423 of the so-called Buzzminers, whereas all 5,800, totalling 620 petahash/second (PH/s) of computing power, will be shipped by the end of January, Hive said.  All in all, Hive mined the equivalent of 4,752 BTC throughout 2022, up 18% compared to the previous year.

Barbat-Layani appeared to be supporting a move proposed last year by the French Senate, which would mandate crypto firms to seek some of regulatory recognition in anticipation of the European Union's new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation by Oct. 1, 2023.  “The AMF, like the parliament, calls for an accelerated move to a regime of obligatory licensing for non-registered providers” of crypto services, Barbat-Layani said at an event, according to a tweet posted by the regulator.  A number of prominent companies, including Binance, have registered with the AMF. The registration involves checks on companies' governance and compliance with anti-money laundering rules. No provider has yet been issued a license, a voluntary procedure set out under French law.  In an article published for Le Figaro newspaper, France Deputy Central Bank Governor Denis Beau said it would be “desirable” to have mandatory licensing in the country ahead of the European Union’s MiCA law coming into effect in 2024, citing the collapse of stablecoin ecosystem Terra-Luna and crypto exchange FTX. Beau's statement appears to confirm reports that Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau is pushing for the change.  The Senate’s legal amendment to require all unregistered crypto companies operating in the country to seek a license was opposed by the French government, and is set to be discussed by the National Assembly’s Finance Committee next week, Jan. 17.

42413192,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl84Om,1673259143,"FTX Opposition to $1B Binance Deal Is 'Hypocrisy and Chutzpah,' Voyager Says","Bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital has defended its $1 billion plan to sell assets to Binance.US, calling criticisms “hypocrisy and chutzpah” based on unverified speculation, two legal filings posted late Sunday night show.  The plan has been opposed by Alameda Research, the trading arm of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, as well as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Department of Justice (DoJ) and numerous state-level regulators, with a hearing due to be held at a New York bankruptcy court on Tuesday.  Doubts expressed by the SEC, alongside financial regulators from New York, Texas and Vermont and the U.S. Trustee, the bankruptcy division of the DoJ, about whether Binance.US can afford the deal are “misplaced,” Voyager said.  “Raising Disclosure Statement objections based on unsubstantiated and unverified media reports while ignoring the substantial information already made available to the Objectors is a naked attempt to undermine the Binance.US Transaction and attack Binance.US,” the filing added.  An attempt by Alameda to oppose the deal on the grounds that it breaches the hierarchies of creditors set out in U.S. bankruptcy law meets a still frostier reception. Alameda's objections ""evince hypocrisy and chutzpah at its finest” and are “frivolous,” the Voyager filing said. FTX and Alameda had previously attempted to bail out Voyager, before declaring bankruptcy on Nov. 11.  Voyager “only entered into the AlamedaFTX Loan Facility based on AlamedaFTX’s fraudulent and false representations,” it added, saying FTX’s own attempted purchase of Voyager was “a last-ditch effort to mask the holes on its own balance sheet resulting from their apparent fraud.”  FTX’s new chief executive officer, John Ray, has criticized perceived mismanagement and poor record-keeping by his predecessor Sam Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to charges including wire fraud and money laundering.  The filing also hit out at what it called a “hypocritical” stance from state regulators, who opposed a scenario in which residents of Vermont, New York, Texas and Hawaii would receive cash payouts while others would get crypto.  “They object to the fact that Account Holders in their jurisdiction would receive cash when it would be their own regulatory decisions (unless they decide to provide fairly straightforward, basic accommodations to their own citizens) creating this result,” the filing said.  Voyager – supported by a committee representing its creditors – said the Binance deal represents the best available option for those owed money by the estate in a volatile crypto market, and added that there were still escape routes to the deal if a better option was identified later.

42413201,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl84WG,1673258980,The Ether Trade That Made the Most Noise Last Week,"During the bull market of early 2021, hyperbullish bets on bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) often crossed the tape on the leading crypto options exchange, Deribit. Two years later, the opposite is happening, with market participants betting on an extended slide in ether.  Last week, a buy order for 50,000 contracts of ether's $400 strike price put option expiring in June appeared on Deribit's order book, raising alarm bells in the crypto community. At press time, ether was priced around $1,300, so the put buyer is expecting a 69% slide in less than six months. On Deribit, one ether options contract represents one ETH.  ""On ether, the trade that made the most talk was the purchase of puts $400 on June 2023 made on-screen with a resting bid of [50,000] contracts,"" digital assets data provider Amberdata said in its weekly newsletter published Sunday.  A put option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market. A resting bid is an order whose price is away from the market and is yet to be executed.  ""If the entity is willing to buy them, it thinks they have value, which can only be true if it falls below $400,"" Patrick Chu, director of institutional sales and trading at Paradigm, said.  As of early Monday, the order was partially filled for 40,000 contracts. The purchaser paid a premium of 0.0095 ETH per contract, amounting to a total outlay of 380 ETH or $494,000, according to data from Deribit.  Call and put option buyers pay a premium to sellers as compensation for offering protection against the bullish or bearish move. The premium is the maximum a buyer can lose if the market goes against their position. The profit potential is unlimited because, in theory, the market could see extreme bull runs or drop to zero.  The order might be an outright bearish bet aimed at profiting from a potential price crash. But it might also be a hedge taken against a bullish spot or futures market exposure in ether or other alternative cryptocurrencies. Most cryptocurrencies move in tandem with market leaders, bitcoin and ether.  ""It could also be a portfolio hedge,"" Chu told CoinDesk. ""It's common for venture capitalists and other entities with illiquid portfolios to buy downside ETH protection as a correlation hedge.""  Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin called it ""tail risk management."" Tail risk is the low chance of a move outside the usual range of expected returns.  ""Whales typically buy a large amount of out-of-the-money or lower strike options in January/July or June/December as insurance to hedge the tail risk to their portfolio. These options purchases are the whales' last line of defense when the worst happens,"" Ardern told CoinDesk.  Ether has crashed more than 70% from its $4,868 November 2021 peak, and it remains to be seen if the cryptocurrency slides further, as anticipated by the whale.  The overall options market sentiment remains bearish, with short-term and long-term call-put skews hovering below zero, the chart sourced from Amberdata shows.  The call-put skews measure the cost of bullish calls relative to puts. The negative number indicates a bias for put options.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/09/the-ether-trade-that-made-the-most-noise-last-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/507ee95dbd17f7c66c482b5562e059a3b451bfdd-6016x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7296196,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515342,1673256655,"Shiba Inu Burn Rate Surges Over 1,300% In 24 Hours","The Shiba Inu (SHIB) token is one of the prominent meme tokens in the crypto market today, having a community of over 3.6 million followers. Liked by many and aiming to be more than just a meme token, the SHIB army committed to a burn mechanism in which they’d have to burn some SHIB tokens to reduce its massive supply. The latest burn, which happened earlier today, is massive compared to the recent SHIB burns. According to data from the SHIB burn tracking site, Shibburn.com, a total of 37,400,646 SHIB have been burned in the last 24 hours, accounting for a surge in burn rate of 1,395.89%. The More SHIB Burned, The Higher The Token’s Value? The SHIB token burn has been a thing that has been going on for a while now, and though every burn doesn’t result in a spike in SHIB’s price, with some burns comes a price movement. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Formed This Pattern, Breakout Incoming? This latest burn resulted in an upside in SHIB of nearly 5%. The price of SHIB between the happening of the SHIB burn had some notable gaps. SHIB was trading at a price of $0.00000832 before the burn and then spiked to nearly 0.00000900 after the burn. Though the total SHIB burned today wasn’t anywhere near the figure burned at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, it is still a notable spike from the total of 2.5 million SHIB burned the day before. The previous burn didn’t result in any significant price movement on the SHIB price chart. Overall, with more SHIB burned over time and more demand than supply, SHIB’s value could appreciate more than expected. Besides, the SHIB price chart shows liquidity at higher highs which need to be taken sooner or later. Details On The Latest SHIB Burn The latest burned SHIB happens to be done with two separate transactions, both with the same aim but different amounts. The first transaction of the SHiB burned was done at 1:26 AM UTC. According to data from Etherscan, we saw the first transaction send a total of 16.7 million SHIB tokens to the burn address. The address which sent the SHIB burned currently holds no SHIB but only about 125 BONE. The second transaction, on the other hand, executed at exactly 3:57 AM UTC, burned a total of 14.9 million SHIB tokens. The address which imitated the transaction currently holds only 0.01 SHIB, according to Etherscan data. While this latest burn means the SHIB army is maintaining its commitment to burning SHIB, another point indicating the community’s seriousness of burning SHIB is the recent Shibarium update. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Lead Dev Ignites Buzz About New Partnership, SHIB Price Stagnates Though the Shibarium layer 2 blockchain is yet to launch, the official Twitter page announced on Saturday a burn mechanism will be introduced. This burn mechanism will be to burn SHIB tokens with each on-chain transaction executed on the Shibarium blockchain. As of writing, SHIB is enjoying a rally to the upside alongside the majority of the crypto market. The token is up by 5% in the last 24 hours with a market price of 0.00000877 and a total circulating supply of roughly 562 trillion SHIB tokens.

42413182,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl84GM,1673255921,Jefferies Downgrades Bitcoin Miner Marathon Digital on Construction Delays,"Investment bank Jefferies downgraded its rating for bitcoin (BTC) miner Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) to ""hold"" from ""buy"" due to construction delays.  ""Worsened mining economics and a lack of transparency around the execution risks for MARA's hosting partners keep us on the sidelines for now,"" Jonathan Petersen and Amanda Santillo wrote in a note to investors published on Sunday. The bank also lowered its price target to $4 from $12.50.  Marathon operates an asset-light model; it only owns the mining machines and relies on counterparties to host them in purpose-built infrastructure. But its counterparties have faced significant construction delays, meaning Marathon's investment won't be generating revenue for a while.  Jefferies expects all of Marathon's ordered machines, which total 23 exahash/second (EH/s) of computing power, to be running at the end of 2023, instead of the company's projected mid-year.  Shares of Marathon Digital were up over 3% at $4.23 in pre-market trading, along with the broader crypto market.  Marathon missed its 9 EH/s hashrate target for the end of 2022, because 2.1 EH/s of computers are awaiting energization at Applied Digital's (APLD) Texas hosting site, who is in turn waiting for regulatory approval to turn on the machines. The miner had already lowered its target for the year from 11.5 EH/s in its third quarter earnings report.  On top of that, Marathon has been negatively impacted by power curtailment on King Mountain site in Texas, Jefferies said.  Last week, Marathon paid off $30 million in a revolving credit facility from troubled crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank (SI).

7294138,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515334,1673253024,This Week In Bitcoin And Crypto: Key Dates To Watch,"As the new week begins, the Bitcoin and crypto market is seeing a bounce that could provide new momentum. The Bitcoin price has managed to break above the resistance area of around $17,000 for the first time in three weeks and was trading at $17,226 (+1.6%) as of press time. Ethereum is up 3.6% over the last 24 hours and is trading at $1,309. However, the euphoria in the Bitcoin and crypto market is hanging by a thread this week, as two events, in particular, could determine how prices develop. On the one hand, things could already become volatile today, as Cameron Winklevoss’ deadline for the Digital Currency Group (DCG) expired yesterday. On the other hand, the December CPI data will be released on Thursday, January 12. Will The DCG Drama Tear Down The Bitcoin Price? NewsBTC reported that the DCG / Grayscale drama took a new turn last week when Gemini wrote an open letter to DCG CEO Barry Silbert. Winklevoss accuses Silbert of using retail funds to engage in “kamikaze Grayscale NAV trading” from which he personally profited. In that stroke, Winklevoss lumps DCG with Celsius (misuse of customer funds) and BlockFi (same GBTC trade). Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Depositing Transactions At 4-Year Low, Bottom Signal? Gemini is also demanding its $900 million in Gemini Earn funds back and has given Silbert until yesterday, Sunday, to comply. So far, no information has become public that a deal has been reached. As Ram Ahluwalia of Lumida Digital Assets Advisors explained on the Unchained podcast, Gemini may file an involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy against Genesis to force the company to pay outstanding creditor debts. January 8 was the date Genesis’ loans are due and Gemini can force them into Chapter 11. If that happens, Genesis will be insolvent and DCG may immediately owe Genesis the entire $1.1 billion. According to Ahluwalia, the best solution for Genesis/DCG and Gemini is a restructuring outside of bankruptcy court, but given Barry Silbert’s alleged stalling tactics, it seems increasingly likely that Genesis will file for Chapter 11. All eyes are therefore likely to be on Cameron Winklevoss today, who could have some bad news for the crypto market with DCG’s bankruptcy filing. Given Grayscale’s massive BTC and crypto holdings, the news could send shockwaves through the market. Bullish News For The Crypto Market On Thursday? On Thursday, January 12 at 8:30 a.m. (EST), the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be released. The forecast is 6.7%. If the number meets or falls below the consensus figure, this could be major for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks Key Barrier And Aims Fresh Rally To $18K The faster the CPI falls, the more likely it is that Jerome Powell will announce only a 25 rate hike on February 1. If this happens, it is also more likely that Powell will refrain sooner than later from rate hikes and declare a pause, which will effectively constitute a pivot by the U.S. central bank.

The team also anticipates the asset’s average and minimum market prices to be around $169.22 and $135.38, respectively.

According to their 2023 price predictions for the altcoin, the coin is expected to attain a value of $113.46 in five days and $135.39 in 30 days. In the next one year, they believe QNT could hit a market price of $175.27 if its growth pattern mirrors that of the internet.

42413189,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl84Mu,1673232253,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Eclipses $17K, Breaking Out of Three-Week Trading Range","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin decisively pushed past $17,000, appearing to break out of a three-week range. In the week ahead traders will be monitoring ongoing speculation involving Digital Currency Group, Tron, Huobi and Solana.  Insights: A fresh news report has rekindled speculation over whether the dominant crypto exchange Binance may be facing scrutiny over its anti-money-laundering controls.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 833.42 +23.6 ▲ 2.9% Bitcoin (BTC) $17,177 +249.5 ▲ 1.5% Ethereum (ETH) $1,294 +32.0 ▲ 2.5% S&P 500 daily close  3,895.08 +87.0 ▲ 2.3% Gold  $1,879 +14.3 ▲ 0.8% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.57% ▼ 0.2 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin pushes past $17K; Week ahead focus is on Fed, DCG, Solana, Tron  By Bradley Keoun  Bitcoin (BTC) decisively pushed past $17,000 on Sunday, breaking out of its recent price range to hit a three-week high.  The largest cryptocurrency by market cap had briefly topped $17,000 on Friday after data suggesting that U.S. services businesses were slowing – seen by traders in both digital-asset and traditional markets as a sign that the Federal Reserve might soon be able to ease up on its push to tighten financial conditions. But it took a couple more days for bitcoin to cement the move past a threshold that had effectively capped any rallies since mid-December.  Analysts were quick to point out that price charts are still tilting bearish, although Coinbase Institutional's David Duong wrote in a report that a successful push past the $17,100 mark might put bitcoin on track toward the next technical level around $17,800.  According to FundStrat's Sean Farrell, blockchain data suggests there are plenty of ready buyers with ""appetite to buy BTC at the very specific level of $16,000-$17,200.""  ""This paints an incredible picture of a strong buy wall at current market prices and suggests a strong bottom is forming,"" Farrell wrote in a report.  At press time, the largest cryptocurrency was changing hands around $17,150, up 1.3% over the past 24 hours.  In the week ahead, bitcoin traders will be monitoring a key report on U.S. inflation – also theoretically an input to the Federal Reserve's calculations. The central bank's monetary tightening last week was a big factor in bitcoin 64% price decline last year, the worst annual performance in four years.  Elsewhere in digital-asset markets, traders will be continuing to monitor the speculation over the future of crypto conglomerate (and CoinDesk owner) Digital Currency Group and its subsidiary Genesis. Another thread is on the prospects for a rebound in Solana's SOL token – one of the biggest ""Sam coins"" that became major casualties of last year's implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange. There's also lingering bearish concerns about Tron's TRX token and Huobi's HT, both linked to the crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun.  Insights  US Investigators Subpoena Hedge Funds in Binance Money-Laundering Probe: Report  By Elizabeth Napolitano  Federal prosecutors are investigating the relationship between Binance and U.S.-based hedge funds as part of a broader investigation into the cryptocurrency exchange's possible skirting of money-laundering guardrails, according to a report by the Washington Post.  Heading the investigation is the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington in Seattle, which, in recent months, has sent subpoenas to firms requesting records of their dealings with Binance, the Post reported, citing two people who had reviewed one of the subpoenas.  The subpoenas come at a time when Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by daily trading volume, faces intense media and regulatory scrutiny over its business practices and financials. That scrutiny boiled over late last year in the wake of FTX's multibillion-dollar implosion, which rocked investor confidence in an increasingly turbulent and troubled crypto market.  The subpoenas do not automatically mean authorities will bring charges against Binance or its founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao, the Post noted as federal authorities are still discussing a potential settlement with Binance and are assessing whether the evidence they have is sufficient to bring charges.  Recently, Binance has made efforts to increase its commitment to compliance, growing its security and compliance staff by 500% in 2022. Additionally, last fall the company assembled a global advisory board chaired by Max Baucus, a former Democratic senator from Montana. Meanwhile, the exchange seems eager to improve its relations with the U.S. government, recently becoming active in crypto lobbying in Washington, DC.
