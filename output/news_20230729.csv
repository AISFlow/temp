15428649,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545005,1690660801,Court Filing Suggests FTX’s $2 Billion Lawsuit Against Genesis Is Coming To An End,"The legal tussle between bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and crypto lender Genesis seems to be coming to a resolution, a recent court filing reveals. According to the letter filed yesterday at the US bankruptcy court for the Southern District of New York, both firms – who happened to have filed for bankruptcy – have agreed to settle their ongoing billion-dollar dispute. How The Feud Began FTX filed a motion in May this year to recover its funds from Genesis and “non-debtor affiliates” so the company could pay back its creditors. The motion went as far as describing Genesis (who attributed its solvency issues to FTX’s collapse) as “one of the main feeder funds and instrumental to its [FTX and Sister company Alameda Research] fraudulent business model.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Reclaims 14th Spot In Market After 5% Jump FTX further claimed that Genesis received “avoidable transfers” from FTX’s debtors totaling almost $3.9 billion. In response, Genesis denied owing FTX and filed a motion asking the bankruptcy judge to rule its debt to FTX as zero. However, a subsequent letter from FTX to the bankruptcy judge showed that the company had reduced its claim from $3.9 billion to $2 billion. FTT token trades at $1.3 amid exchange's woes | Source: FTTUSD on Tradingview.com FTX’s claim could have delayed a creditor payout and slowed Genesis’ bankruptcy proceedings. However, with settlement in sight, things are likely to move along quickly, as according to the letter, FTX, its associated debtors, and debtors in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy case have reached a preliminary agreement. The court filing reads: The parties have reached an agreement in principle, subject to documentation, regarding a settlement that would resolve, among other things, the claims asserted by the FTX debtors against the debtors in these Chapter 11 Cases and the claims asserted by the Genesis debtors against the FTX debtors in the FTX Chapter 11 cases. Genesis Still Not In The Clear Despite reaching a settlement with FTX, crypto lending platform Genesis still has other lawsuits to deal with, including one filed by Gemini against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert. Gemini’s co-founder Cameron Winklevoss called out Barry Silbert on Twitter in an open letter, claiming that Silbert and DCG had engaged in “Fraudulent Behavior.” Related Reading: This Machine Learning Tool Was Asked To Predict XRP Price, Here’s What It Said He warned that Silbert’s failure to reply and come to the negotiation table by Friday would result in a lawsuit. In a follow-up tweet, Winklevoss also tabled a “best and final offer” involving a repayment plan. Still, Silbert and DCG failed to reply, and true to his words, Winklevoss and Gemini filed a lawsuit against DCG and Silbert for fraud on July 7.

Projects like Tron (TRX) are experiencing a reduction in new investors. However, the new project Uwerx seems unfazed by the chaos and has become a ray of hope for investors seeking gains. This article discusses its features and how it aims to outperform Tron (TRX) before the end of this year. >>BUY WERX TOKENS NOW Tron (TRX) Fails To Record Gains The past 24 hours have not favored Tron (TRX). The project is on a bearish trend, declining by 0.81% in the last 24hrs. Tron (TRX) trades at $0.069, representing a 1.95% decrease in the past seven days. Tron (TRX) holders are optimistic about the coin's future even though analysts believe the project does not show signs of being a lucrative short-term investment. Analysts have predicted Tron (TRX) to trade at $0.12 in 2024, yet they believe the recent SEC lawsuit could threaten this prediction. Arkham Platform Joins The Tron (TRX) Network TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain-based system created to give content creators full ownership rights to their content. Tron (TRX) entered the top 10 crypto ranking on June 9, 2023. This marked a significant milestone for the project. The project announced on June 13 that the daily active accounts on its network had surpassed 4.55 million, marking a record high from the start of the year. Following this, Tron (TRX) formed a strategic partnership with DWF Labs. The partnership will see DWF Labs become a liquidity provider for Tron (TRX). On June 19, 2023, Tron (TRX) announced that Arkham, the pioneering platform for ""Total Crypto Intelligence,"" has been integrated into the Tron (TRX) network. This collaboration is a significant milestone for Arkham, as it aims to provide comprehensive blockchain insights across multiple blockchains. For Arkham users, the partnership will give them access to the activities of wallets in the Tron (TRX) ecosystem. That same day, Tron (TRX) Celebrated its fifth Independence Day Anniversary. The project also partnered with TaskOn to share a 2000 USDD prize pool. Despite Tron's (TRX) impressive partnership, analysts believe Uwerx offers more profit potential. Let's check out why. >>BUY WERX TOKENS NOW Uwerx (WERX) Continues To Rise At 18:00 UTC later today, the tokens' price will undergo an increase from $0.05245 to $0.0564, and buyers will also enjoy a generous 15% bonus. It also offers a 15% purchase bonus, making investors troop to the project. As more investors flooded the presale, the project’s developers increased the tokens available for presale to 57%. This left 427.5 million tokens out of the 750 million total supply. They also bumped the launch price to $0.095 - $0.115. This unparalleled presale success was made possible by the agile methodology approach used by the developers, which allowed them to unveil the project in stages while improving it with each new release. Why Investors And Freelancers Favor Uwerx (WERX) Many traders agree that the future of the world market will lie with the freelance sector. This thought is influenced by the reports from Velocity Global stating that 59% of freelancers believe they make more from freelancing than they would in a traditional role. In that light, Uwerx is coming to fuse blockchain technology with freelancing and thus improve the industry. Uwerx(WERX) aims to best big players like Upwork and Fiverr by offering fast-track transactions, security, a 1% fee, and more. The project's team saw that the platform promoted transparency and security. They passed the project through audit approvals and authentication from SolidProof and InterFi Network before the presale. They plan to relinquish ownership of all smart contracts, which will occur when the project joins centralized exchanges. On top of that, on June 7, 2023, they set a nine-month liquidity lock on their share of WERX tokens. This date was decided after 82.8% of community members voted for it to be locked during the presale instead of the earlier proposed date. The team also agreed to a test airdrop after 98.2% of voters wanted it. The team believes the airdrop will serve as an excellent way for users to be sure their receiving wallet addresses are right. These polls underscore the team's commitment to promoting community-centricity. In another community-centric move, the team cut down their token allocation to just 7%, offering users more opportunities to join and earn from the project. The team also introduced a new feature called the Uwerx Vault, which offers users a place to earn rewards by saving their tokens for a desired period. The Alpha version of Uwerx has launched with a Signup, Landing, Forgot Password, Sign In, Client Initiation, and Freelancer pages. The version also has the Initial Step of Finding Talent page, Job Creation Process, Initial Step of Job Creation, Hiring Dashboard, and My Activity Pages. Based on user feedback on the Alpha version, the development team has made several enhancements by adding or redesigning pages such as Application Boosting, Settings, Milestones, Freelancer Profile Creation, and Job Application Pages. They also condensed the freelancer application page into a single page. They plan to focus on enhancing other sections, including the Tools, Freelancer Dashboard, and Client Dashboard. Meanwhile, the team will launch the Beta version soon so that users can interact with it. Users are urged to continue sending recommendations and suggestions to the team's dedicated email, feedback@uwerx.network. Analysts speculate that Uwerx (WERX) could become a prominent crypto asset, trading above $2.5 by Q4 2023. This means that it will bring more returns for investors than Tron (TRX) before the end of the year. So now is the perfect time to get into the project's presale.

Also, we chatted with Web3 influencers to suss out if the crypto degens are ready to migrate from Twitter to Meta’s Threads or another decentralized social media platform.  You’re reading The Airdrop, our weekly newsletter where we discuss the biggest stories across Web3. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.  This Week's Alpha  Much ado about Snoo: Reddit released its Gen 4 Collectible Avatar series, bringing a new batch of colorful collectibles to its NFT shop reimagining the platform’s iconic ""Snoo"" character. Titled “Retro Reimagined,” the microblogging site says it is meant to inspire ""warm, fuzzy feelings of nostalgia” and features designs from 100 independent artists and popular NFT collections like Cool Cats.  Learning from the past: Previous releases have not been entirely smooth, so this time around, the Reddit team implemented anti-bot measures like CAPTCHA to create a better user experience. In addition, the platform introduced spend limits and launched an “initial access” period on the first day to limit the number of NFTs a user could sweep in one go. Still, it wasn’t a perfect launch.  Soaring sales: According to data from Dune Analytics, there are now over 14.5 million avatar holders.  Amazon primed and ready: The e-commerce giant has added new blockchain tools to its Amazon Web Services cloud platform, expanding the capabilities of its Amazon Managed Blockchain service that provides manicured infrastructure for developers looking to build Web3 applications faster. The new tools, ""Access"" and ""Query,"" allow developers to interact with public blockchains more seamlessly and expand node offerings with serverless, scalable access to blockchains.  Add to cart: The new tools expand the platform’s already-growing Web3 ambitions, which reportedly include plans for an NFT marketplace.  Threadheads: While Meta’s new Threads social app recently onboarded millions of normies, the question remains: Will it be cool enough to lure the vibrant crypto community away from its native Twitter homebase? Some Web3 strategists and builders are skeptical of its pull. “I don't need a Twitter clone – I need Meta to think deeper about creating new ways to connect,” Riley Blackwell, Web3-focused community-building strategist, told us.  Decentralized dreams: While the platform is compatible with decentralized social media protocol ActivityPub, which would allow users to interact with other social media platforms like Mastodon, Bluesky and others, signing up still requires an existing Instagram account. This makes it more difficult to maintain anonymity online, which is important to a number of Web3 artists and creators. It’s also virtually impossible to leave the platform once you join.  Scoring on simplicity: The platform does offer a more simplified and seamless onboarding process that allowed it bring in new users so quickly. A thread can be cross-posted as an Instagram story, sowing early seeds of interoperability. Still, Threads users are already spending way less time on the app, which could make it a passing fad – a phenomenon high-speed crypto traders are all too familiar with.  Project in the news  Stan Lee Universe  Who: VeVe and Kartoon Studios  What: NFT marketplace VeVe has released a new series of chibi-style NFTs based on Marvel legend Stan Lee. Each of the four artworks had various edition numbers and rarity ranks. Kartoon Studio, which partnered with VeVe on the release, said that the collectibles experienced a “near-instantaneous” sell-out of its over 8,000 NFTs.  How: The collectibles, released as “blind boxes” that were only revealed after purchase, were priced at $15 each. According to Bloomberg, the drop brought in about $120,000 and rose in value by at least 500% by Monday morning. On the VeVe app, some collectibles were listed for resale for up to $749.  In Other News  No admission fee: The 270-year-old British Museum is entering the metaverse through a partnership with The Sandbox, bringing its collection to the virtual world as well as releasing a collection of NFTs.  Star Atlas shrinks its galaxy: The company behind the Web3 game laid off over 70% of its staff this week, but the CEO said that their vision hasn’t changed.  Twitter trading: Web3 wallet Suku has launched an app that allows Twitter (X?) users to directly send digital currencies and NFTs to each other, a feature Musk hopes to add to his social media platform.  From Vintage to MNTGE: Digital Fashion brand MNTGE released a new collection of NFT patches paired with physical twins and linked to real-world rewards.  Frequent flier: United Arab Emirates carrier Etihad Airways plans to introduce a Web3 loyalty program that will allow holders to stake NFTs for miles and travel perks.  Non-Fungible Toolkit  ERC-6551: Unpacking The ‘Backpack’ Wallet  In the past few months, several Web3 projects have adopted the ERC-6551 standard, or token-bound account. The new standard opens up a plethora of use cases across NFTs, gaming, DAOs and the metaverse.  For example, let’s say a PFP NFT collection implements an ERC-6551 token standard.

That event saw XRP’s price soar to about $0.93. However, XRP’s price seems to have cooled off, settling at the $0.7 price mark. Despite this, there still seems to be bullish sentiment around XRP’s future price, which is why this Machine Learning tool was consulted to predict XRP’s price. Here’s What It Said PricePredictions.com, a site powered by an advanced machine learning algorithm that provides current and futuristic trends about several tokens, was consulted in a bid to get an insight into XRP’s future price and to better position themselves in case of a rally by the token. Related Reading: Ripple Attorney Withdraws From SEC Lawsuit, Will It Affect XRP? According to XRP’s futuristic price action, the AI tool forecasts that there will be an upward trend that will see XRP gain about 1.5% in value from its current price of $0.7. It has also been projected that XRP will hit the price mark of $0.71 by August 26, 2023.

42392863,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCmvD,1690628400,AWS-Reliant Blockchains Won’t Bring Transparency to AI,"The rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) has captivated the world, with many asking what is next for this technological breakthrough. While AI has already demonstrated its potential to transform various industries, it faces a major roadblock to large-scale adoption: a lack of trust and transparency.  Decentralized computation via the blockchain can alleviate the current trust issues, but there is a catch.  Dominic Williams is the founder and chief cientist of the DFINITY Foundation, a not-for-profit research and development organization and major contributor to the Internet Computer.  There is currently limited insight and no real way to validate the sources of data that an AI model is trained on, exactly what data is being collected by the model and, by extension, how that data informs the model and its accuracy.  Until there is a fundamental change to the transparency of AI programs and the infrastructure they are built on, users at all levels will not feel secure in leveraging these models due to a lack of trust and overall skepticism.  The intersection of AI and blockchain technology offers synergies that will enhance both technologies and drive widespread adoption through their integration.  See also: Inside the Orb: The Untold Story of Worldcoin's Launch  Currently, most blockchains lack the necessary infrastructure to support AI models due to their limited computing power as AI requires substantial computational resources and data sets. Limitations on computing power are caused in part by the fact that the majority of blockchains are not fully decentralized.  Instead, many of the world’s most popular blockchains today are reliant on a centralized cloud infrastructure (i.e. Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services), hindering the blockchain’s ability to support processing and storing data at the speed required for AI.  Despite negative headlines concerning the current attempts at integrating AI with blockchain are not what they seem. Current integrations have resulted in AI that runs WITH the blockchain rather than the desired goal of running AI ON the blockchain.  The core infrastructure and underlying technology for these “blockchain AI” projects mainly operate on centralized servers, and utilize plugins that connect centralized AI models to blockchains running on centralized cloud networks. This defeats the purpose of leveraging blockchain technology for AI as it doesn’t address the underlying issues of trust and transparency.  A completely/fully decentralized blockchain, such as The Internet Computer (ICP), the network I helped build that offers compute power matching or exceeding Web2 cloud servers, will allow AI models to be run entirely inside of smart contracts. This will make the training parameters and inputs that make large language models both open source and tamper-proof. To enable AI integration on the blockchain, we need blockchains capable of processing data at speeds comparable to Web2 clouds, which can only come from full decentralization.  Hosting AI models on the blockchain itself allows AI systems to leverage inherent decentralization to increase the transparency of every aspect of the model. Thus, AI on the blockchain is the next logical step for long-term success as blockchain will enhance AI’s credibility, accountability and security, fostering greater trust among users.  However, there are misconceptions about how exactly the two pieces of technology can operate in unison and until they are dispelled, the growth of the AI ecosystem will be unable to reach its full potential.  Fully realizing the potential of AI on the blockchain requires a truly decentralized network. It must be capable of storing and processing data so that full models can be run unencumbered within smart contracts. These decentralized systems like ICP will empower AI to function as an autonomous cloud, transforming the landscape of AI development.  Establishing truth and trust  For example, consider an AI model designed for medical professionals. The model is widely used but ultimately produces untrustworthy responses. That is because there is no easy way to verify the training data the model was built on and how that data was used.  This centralized model only produces outputs, with no insight into the inputs. However, in a decentralized environment, the AI large language model can be built solely off of renowned medical textbooks and reputable databases of medical research papers.  When the doctor interacts with the AI, the hidden process is fully transparent and the cryptographic proof guarantees what content the AI has been trained on. Thus, the generated response can be verified and doctors can trust the results.  This example is just one of many that demonstrate why decentralization is critical to building trust in AI models. By operating in a fully open and public environment, AI on the blockchain ensures transparency in data processing, enabling users to understand how their data is utilized.  Further, on-chain AI applications can all access and contribute to the same data set, creating a collaborative ecosystem within the blockchain. The tamper-proof and secure nature of blockchains ensures that this data is also less susceptible to misuse for malicious purposes.  See also: 10 Ways Crypto and AI Can Make Each Other Better  The collaboration between AI and blockchain presents a remarkable opportunity to advance both technologies and promote a more trustworthy and reliable exchange of information.  By addressing concerns around trust and transparency this integration offers a more reliable and transparent digital ecosystem. The potential of AI on the blockchain is vast, promising seamless integration, open-source tamper-proof smart contracts and rapid content generation for metaverses, games and decentralized social media.

Source: Kaiko/Twitter This notable decrease in trading activity suggests a decline in attention from investors since the AI token frenzy peaked in January. And this appears to be reflected in the price performances of many AI-related cryptocurrencies. The Graph (GRT), the largest AI token in the market, was one of the top gainers at the start of 2023, surging by roughly 122% to reach a yearly high of $0.2323 on February 7. However, the price of the GRT token has since plummeted, with a 51% decline from the 2023 peak. Can ChatGPT & OpenAI Do It Again? As mentioned earlier, the surge of interest in AI tokens was partly driven by the launch of ChatGPT. However, there has not been a similar effect on the AI and big-data crypto economy following the launch of Sam Altman’s Worldcoin project and WLD token. On July 24, 2023, Altman, the CEO of OpenAI – the artificial intelligence company behind ChatGPT – rolled out his crypto product, releasing the World ID development kit and the WLD token. The WLD token soared more than 85% to reach an all-time high of $3.3 on the day of launch, according to CoinGecko data. However, the cryptocurrency’s price has declined by over 31% since hitting this peak.

Notably, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin voiced his concern over the project’s iris-scanning hardware and biometric data collection practices. Meanwhile, Worldcoin looks set to face some regulatory scrutiny, with the UK’s data regulator Information Commissioner Office (ICO) already making inquiries. France’s privacy regulator CNIL has also questioned the legality of the project’s biometric data collection. While the Worldcoin project and the WLD token seem to be gaining some traction at the moment, it remains to be seen how they will impact the AI and big-data crypto economy. As of this writing, the WLD token changes hand at $2.27, with a 6.8% price increase in the past day.

After the consumer purchases map credits, HONEY-USD tokens are burned equal to the fiat amount of the contract. Hivemapper’s data is fresh and up to date as the global network of vehicle dashcams are constantly recording while drivers go about their normal routes. Hivemapper's crowdsourced, crypto-based mapping could disrupt the market, with its token HONEY-USD's value derived from factors including market size, share, token velocity, and circulation. Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. Please note, VanEck has made its first side pocket investment in Hivemapper's HONEY (HONEY-USD) token. This investment was made through a transaction directly with Hivemapper, Inc. Post purchase, VanEck owns less than 75 bps of the fully diluted token supply. Our investment comes with a 1-year lock-up. Hivemapper presents a unique opportunity utilizing cryptocurrency to crowdsource contributions toward building a decentralized mapping network. In the short term, Hivemapper has proven crypto is a transformative means of incentivizing a global network of actors to work toward a common goal. In the long term, Hivemapper may be able to take market share away from incumbent mapping players by offering a better, cheaper product to its clients. Hivemapper’s goal is to create a decentralized and permissionless global map that anyone can contribute to and utilize however they want. They aim to have more global, street-level coverage than existing players while providing higher-quality data, all for a lower cost. How it Works Drivers worldwide can purchase and install a 4k dashcam into their vehicles to record their daily routes. In return for providing constant real-time and high-quality global map data, drivers are rewarded with HONEY-USD token. Additionally, if you don’t have a vehicle or the cost of the dashcam is prohibitively expensive, you can still contribute to the network as an Annotator. Annotators play a machine learning model training game, labeling traffic lights, speed limits, and other street signs. This is similar to how Google uses Captcha for ML training, except these participants get paid. They too earn HONEY-USD for bettering the mapping data and training the machine learning model, which will eventually be able to annotate map data itself. These contributors are crucial to the supply side of the Hivemapper ecosystem. Source: Hivemapper. The demand side network participants consist of consumers, such as enterprises or developers, who want to purchase the street-level data the Hivemapper suppliers have aggregated. Consumers who may be particularly interested in digital mapping data could include location-based service applications, logistics companies, and automotive manufacturers who require accurate navigation systems. Interested consumers can purchase Hivemapper Map API services via Map Credits. Credits are purchased in fiat, priced at $0.02/map credit. 50 map credits provide access to 1 kilometer worth of map data. For example, if a customer wanted all of NYC’s map data, it would be 7,837,650 map credits or $156,753. After the consumer purchases map credits, HONEY-USD tokens are burned equal to the fiat amount of the contract. The burned tokens are then reallocated toward a new rewards pool for contributors. Under this burn and mint token structure, the supply of HONEY-USD stays fixed at 10 billion tokens. Source: Hivemapper. Key Performance Indicators Global map coverage is the foundation upon which Hivemapper needs to build for long-term success. Hivemapper must have just as much, if not more, coverage to compete with centralized tech offerings. Since launching in November ’22, Hivemapper’s network has grown dramatically with coverage across 3.6 million unique road kilometers. For reference, it took Google Maps 12 years to collect 16 million km . If unique road coverage continues to grow at its current pace, Hivemapper could reach 10 million km by 2024. Source: Hivemapper . Another KPI we can observe is the total number of contributors to the network. As more contributors come aboard, they further map coverage as well as data quality and freshness, increasing value and thus demand from end clients. Source: Dune Analytics as of 7/3/2023. Lastly, we can track Token Burn, which provides insight into the demand for Map Credits and, thereby, a measure of Revenue generated by the network. Currently, there are significantly more tokens being newly emitted as rewards for contributing than tokens being burned for map credits. We expect that to change over time as fresher, cheaper, and broader coverage will increase demand for map credits. Source: Dune Analytics as of 7/3/2023. Key Issues Being Solved Many issues stem from centralized tech giants’ approach to building digital mapping networks. Namely: Price Gouging: Existing offerings upcharge their customers because comparable alternatives largely do not exist. Many customers, especially SMEs, can no longer afford their services with rampant price hikes . Maps are not up to date: Company street-view vehicles can only reach most locations on an infrequent basis. Data collection is especially sparce and outdated in emerging market areas where firms believe they will not receive as much economic benefit for providing up-to-date coverage. OpEx and CapEx Heavy: Mapping the world is capital and human resource intensive. Gathering data through centralized company vehicles can cost ~$500k each to build and deploy. It is costly to gather mass coverage without deep pockets. Freely uses our data: Users are not compensated for data collection. Source: Messari. Hivemapper aims to solve these issues. The network’s costs to the end consumer are significantly cheaper because they do not have the high operational or capital expenditures to collect the mapping data. Hivemapper’s data is fresh and up to date as the global network of vehicle dashcams are constantly recording while drivers go about their normal routes. Furthermore, the HONEY-USD token can incentivize coverage of areas less frequently traveled. HONEY-USD not only incentivizes and manages behavior on the network, but it also allows for contributors to be compensated for their data as well as be financially aligned in the success of the network. Source: Hivemapper. Interesting Use Cases Currently, Hivemapper focuses on navigational use cases, of which there are many. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are being implemented into new vehicles for high-level autonomous driving. Up-to-date mapping data is critical to the ADAS system as knowing detailed road object information such as lane definitions, debris, traffic lights, and signage is paramount. Logistics companies may want to have visuals of loading docks and parking restrictions before delivery, as knowing can save them time and money. Governments want to know where road maintenance is necessary, have traffic intelligence, or the fastest routes available for emergency response times. Source: Hivemapper. HONEY Valuation Framework Based on Hivemapper’s Burn and Mint tokenomic model, whereby HONEY-USD is emitted to contributors for participating in the network and HONEY-USD is burned as a receipt for consumer map credit purchases, we can use an Equation of Exchange framework to derive its value. The equation used is MV=PQ. M, the size of the asset base, V, the velocity of the token, and PQ, the yearly transaction value. We start by estimating the Total Addressable Market Size for the Digital Mapping Market. Then we need to estimate Hivemapper’s take rate of that market to get an implied revenue ((PQ)). In Hivemapper’s case, revenue is a product of map credits sold multiplied by the fiat cost of map credits. We envision Hivemapper’s data being integrated into multiple incumbent map players’ offerings as it could lead to 50%+ in cost savings for them and offer fresher, higher quality data to their customers. Due to the cost savings they could provide to their competitors and a superior product offering, we believe Hivemapper will have a considerable market share. Next, we need to estimate HONEY-USD’s velocity or how often the token exchanges hands each year. As a utility token in the Hivemapper ecosystem, its velocity will be greater than store-of-value assets like Bitcoin but less than a stablecoin which has no speculation over its future value. We can use an average velocity of a basket of utility tokens for this ((V)). Estimating HONEY-USD’s Revenue ((PQ)) and Velocity ((V)), we can back into its implied market cap ((M)). Lastly, we must estimate the number of HONEY-USD tokens circulating, which is a product of emissions to contributors for global map coverage progress as well as token unlocks. Dividing the market cap by the number of tokens circulating, we can come up with an implied value for HONEY-USD. Key Risks Hivemapper certainly doesn’t come without its risks and concerns. The cost of the dashcams, $299, may be prohibitively expensive for many to join on a global scale. However, this could be alleviated as third party dashcam providers come to market offering cheaper solutions. Our other concern lies in the fact that map data collection is only half the battle. The other half is marketing and sourcing clients to sell this data to. While we believe Hivemapper is on the path towards building a superior product, they must compete with the tech giants’ sales teams, who have robust pipelines and headcount. However, we envision a world in which Hivemapper’s data could be integrated into the backend of existing map players’ offerings as it can provide more real-time, street-level data and cut their costs significantly. Source: Hivemapper . Closing Thoughts Hivemapper takes an interesting bottom-up approach to building a mapping infrastructure network traditionally built top-down by centralized tech players with deep pockets. By using a token incentive model, contributors are compensated for their data and are willing to continue to provide coverage to the network as they have an economic motivation to share in its success. With the potential for broader, fresher, and higher quality coverage than existing offerings and lower costs to the end clients, we believe Hivemapper will gain traction and market share over the coming years.

Unquestionably, these distinctive digital assets have been a significant force behind the NFT transformations that have taken place. Despite the wide variety of NFT collections and their accomplishments, it is crucial to recognize that some particular ones have recently been severely affected by market pressures and are now beginning to fall from their lofty positions. Consider the situation with CryptoPunks. CoinGecko discovered that of the top 11 “blue chip” NFT projects studied, CryptoPunks suffered the worst losses. Non-fungible tokens known as “blue chip NFTs” are regarded as highly precious and prestigious in digital assets. These NFTs are frequently linked to well-known and recognized producers or organizations, such as renowned artists, enduring businesses, or essential historical items. Source: CoinGecko Collectors and investors widely seek after them due to scarcity, historical relevance, and the artist’s reputation that determine their value. Alarming statistics currently facing CryptoPunks are raising questions among NFT enthusiasts. These formerly well-liked digital assets have recently encountered a worrying situation, sparking disputes and disagreements among investors and fans.

15412851,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/indias-supreme-court-criticizes-lack-of-crypto-regulation,1690619400,India’s Supreme Court Criticizes Lack Of Crypto Regulation,"The Supreme Court of India came down heavily on the central government, expressing displeasure over the lack of a clear law or regulations when it came to cryptocurrencies. The Apex court also noted a lack of an expert agency to probe criminal cases involving cryptocurrencies. Court Questions Government The Supreme Court stated that it was unfortunate that the central government had not brought in any type of legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies. The court also asked the central government to clarify whether it intended to set up a federal agency to investigate criminal cases that involve crypto. It also stressed the importance of setting up an agency capable of comprehending and thoroughly investigating cases involving crypto at a national level, adding that it is in the country’s interests to have such an agency in place. The bench, comprising of Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Surya Kant, also questioned the quality of investigations carried out by the police, stating they may not possess the necessary expertise to handle such cases but are still being promoted to higher ranks and positions. The bench remarked, “You still don’t have any law, unfortunately. Do you have an agency at the national level to understand these cases and investigate them properly? We want you to identify a national specialized agency in the national interest. What kind of a quality investigation can you expect when you have a police constable who gets promoted to an assistant sub-inspector or a sub-inspector to handle such cases?” Innocent Investors Suffering The court urged the government to devise a legal regime to handle cases involving cryptocurrencies at the earliest. The bench expressed anguish that innocent investors were being duped while the government had no capable agency present at the national level to investigate the complex nature of crypto transactions. The bench remarked to the additional solicitor general, Vikramjit Bannerjee, stating, “There has to be some legislative mechanism. You can tell us that it is for you to decide whether or not you want it. But so long you don’t have a mechanism, how do you investigate people and keep them behind bars? It’s, after all, the country’s money that is being siphoned off. It’s like Hawala. Who has the responsibility to stop it? We thought you would yourself come forward and provide some solution.” The Case In Question The bench made the remarks while hearing a case involving a Delhi resident facing charges of crypto fraud in multiple cases, including Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Jharkhand. The accused individual, Ganesh Shivkumar Sagar, has filed several petitions seeking bail and asking that all cases against him be transferred to a central agency for further investigation. In another incident, the CBI apprehended a Delhi resident who posed as a Canadian government official, tricking his victims into transferring their digital assets to crypto wallets that were then misappropriated with the help of multiple accomplices. A subsequent search operation saw the agency recover over 1 crore in cash from the prime accused’s premises located in Delhi. According to the first information report (FIR) filed by the CBI, the main accused, along with an accomplice, pretended to be Canadian government officials. The accused then tricked an individual based in Quebec, coercing them into depositing over 7000 CAD, equivalent to around Rs. 4.30 lakh, into a crypto wallet.

Even as the dust settles after Ripple’s recent victory jubilation, the cryptocurrency market remains keen on XRP. Kaiko, a provider of market data on digital assets, reports that the open interest ratio on XRP futures trades on prominent exchanges remains quite impressive. Recently, the crypto market has experienced a pervasive price reversal. Despite the pullbacks, traders’ interest in the Ripple cryptocurrency remained remarkably high, according to Kaiko. At the time of writing, XRP was in the red in all timeframes, trading at $$0.712, down a measly 0.02% in the last 24 hours, and a considerable 8.4% in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. Given these numbers, XRP is still able to shine in another key department. XRP in crimson in all timeframes during the weekend. Source: Coingecko XRP Community Remains Upbeat About The Crypto Kaiko shows that across numerous markets, XRP’s volume-to-open interest ratio is consistently higher than the median value. This reliability suggests that the XRP coin is actively traded in a healthy market. This percentage is significantly greater than the market average, indicating strong liquidity and sustained interest from traders and investors. On prominent exchanges, the volume-to-open-interest ratio is also used to measure trading activity. When the interest metric is high, it indicates that more purchasers and sellers are willing to trade the token, which indicates speculative interest. A favorable volume-to-open interest ratio could be a signal for market participants to trade in such a token.

In the past week, there has been a significant upturn in its on-chain volume. Casper has experienced a substantial price surge in the past 24 hours, with its value increasing by 4.62%. This surge has created excitement among investors, especially as the cryptocurrency has displayed steady growth over the past 7 days, gaining an impressive 14.58%.

It is trading above the $0.70 mark, with the $0.66 level acting as a support. Related Reading: Stanford MBA Explains Why Next Bitcoin Cycle Could Be “Bigger” Over the past 24 hours, XRP has exhibited sideways trading yet shows potential signs of price appreciation. The technical analysis indicates a leaning toward bullish sentiment, with positive buying strength, demand, and accumulation. Even though the emergence of a pattern suggesting further bullishness is possible, it remains critical for XRP to maintain support at $0.66 and $0.56 levels. Additionally, breaking through critical resistance levels is essential for the bulls to retain market control. Encouragingly, the altcoin’s market capitalization has increased, signaling a positive development for the altcoin. XRP Price Analysis: One-Day Chart When writing, the altcoin XRP was trading at $0.71. The XRP price chart shows the formation of a bullish reversal pattern known as a cup and handle. Despite this positive pattern, the coin’s true bullish potential will be determined by its ability to surpass two significant resistance levels at $0.76 and $0.84, respectively. It’s worth noting that after reaching a yearly high of $0.94, XRP encountered resistance at $0.84 twice. On the downside, if there is a decline from the current price level, XRP may find support at $0.66 and then at $0.56. Technical Analysis In recent trading sessions, the buying strength of the altcoin has shown consistency. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has held steady around the 60-mark over the past few weeks, indicating buyers have maintained control of the price action. This positive signal suggests that the coin will attract more buyers if the price remains above the $0.66 level. Moreover, the price of XRP has remained above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating buoyant demand and confirming that buyers are actively driving the price momentum in the market. With the surge in purchasing power, the altcoin exhibits a decline in sell signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) reflects changes in price momentum.
