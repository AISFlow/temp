20942400,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4655512-cleanspark-well-positioned-for-future?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1701474744,CleanSpark: Well Positioned For The Future,"Summary CleanSpark reported a 15% increase in revenue in Q3, with full-year revenue slightly missing expectations. The company had a larger than anticipated operating loss due in part to a depreciation charge related to out-of-service miners. CleanSpark has seen an 82% increase in stock price in the last month and is on track for a strong fourth quarter for revenue. In my view, management has navigated crypto winter well and is heading into the halving with right tools. I last covered CleanSpark ( CLSK ) for Seeking Alpha in late August. At that time, the company was operating 9 EH/s and the stock was trading a little under $6 per share. In response to the release of the company's full 2023 fiscal year performance, the stock has been absolutely ripping. As of article submission, CLSK shares are trading for well over $7. In this update, we'll look at some key takeaways from the quarter ended September 30th, as well as November production figures, and some additional considerations with 5 months remaining until the dreaded Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) block reward halving. Earnings Reaction In calendar year Q3, CleanSpark reported a sequential increase in revenue of 15% from $45.5 million to $52.5 million. Full year revenue came in at $168.4 million which was slightly below what some analysts were expecting. At 47% quarter over quarter, cost of revenues actually grew faster than revenue. While down sequentially, year over year gross profit grew from $9.5 to $22.1 million. Growth in total opex was large. CleanSpark saw a 20% year over year increase in SG&A and a 255% increase in depreciation and amortization. CleanSpark Operating Income (Seeking Alpha) For the quarter, operating income was negative $61 million. After two quarters of improvement in operating income, this result is disappointing. But it should be noted that the company ate a $32.7 million depreciation charge related to out of service older miners in preparation for the halving. Interestingly, the market largely shrugged off the operating loss. Data by YCharts CLSK shares are up 82% in the last month. Furthermore, this rally has continued even after earnings that I'd view as fairly negative and a 22% increase in shares outstanding over the prior quarter. The optimism in the Bitcoin mining space isn't limited to just CleanSpark. Sector Performance (Seeking Alpha) But while many of these stocks have moved by as much as 200 to 300% year to date, CLSK has been the top performer over the last month and over the last six months. In addition to guidance for exahash growth, what I have personally liked about CleanSpark specifically is the company's Bitcoin treasury management strategy this year. Production & HODL Approach Shortly after releasing earnings, CleanSpark also dropped November production results on the market. In November, the company mined a record 666 BTC. Of that production, CleanSpark sold 402 BTC at an average price of $36.6k. This comes after management sold 562 BTC in October at an average price of $28.6k. Combining those two months of BTC sales, CleanSpark already has $30.8 million in calendar Q4 revenue which is ahead of last year's revenue result for the entire quarter. And again, we still have a full month of production remaining and BTC is flirting with $40k. BTC Treasury (Author Chart via CleanSpark Disclosures) Despite these BTC sales in October and November, CleanSpark has managed to grow HODL stack for 9 consecutive months and currently holds 2,575 BTC. At an article submission Bitcoin price of $38.8k, CleanSpark's BTC treasury has a fair value of just under $100 million. This is capital that the company can put to use for expansion or hold for price appreciation. On the conference call, CEO Zach Bradford seemed to indicate the company will take a balanced approach from here: You'll notice that we grew our balance swiftly over the last few months. We did this to strategically boost the balance, as we sense price improvement was on the horizon. We expect to continue to grow our Bitcoin treasury, but we have shifted back to a strategy of using our Bitcoin for expenses and holding the difference. This approach to treasury management is in stark contrast to total production liquidation that we see from some of the other fast-growing mining companies. It is my personal view that the balanced approach will prove the better strategy, especially post-halving. On The Halving At this point, I feel I've mentioned the halving as a looming risk for Bitcoin miners in about a dozen different BTC miner articles. If the equity market hasn't priced this event in at this point, I'd be very surprised. What is yet unknowable is to what degree the transaction fee market for Bitcoin will be sticky in the future. We saw an example of transaction fees spike as a percentage of the Bitcoin block reward back in May. That spike was short-lived and returned to historical norms by the summer. Transaction Fee Percentage (HashRateIndex) In November, we saw that fee market move up again and this time it appears to be less of a flash in the pan and more sustained. Rather than observing a dramatic spike that takes transaction fees to 75% of total block reward for a brief period of time like we saw in May, we've seen virtually an entire month of the transaction fee share of block reward above 10%. BTC Transaction Fees (Author Chart via IntoTheBlock Data) It arguably hasn't come with as much fanfare, but the total BTC paid to miners from transaction fees in November was only 15% below that of May. If this continues, we may see surprise upsides to revenue in Q4. Of course, the counter to this is the fact that as mining revenue increases with more transaction fees, global hash rate will also increase as more market participants want to compete for the reward. We're clearly seeing that story play out as well: Data by YCharts It's admittedly been volatile, but the long term trend is very clear. There is increasing competition for BTC mining whether it comes from fees or fresh supply. No matter how high hash rate gets, fresh BTC emissions will not increase with hash. In fact, the supply is designed to decrease. This is the major risk to every Bitcoin miner both private and public and it's why I've tried to highlight the importance of transaction fees going forward. From my February Bitcoin article discussing the emergence of Ordinals on Bitcoin's block space: If the Bitcoiners who don't like the Ordinals project want to stop what they view as network spam with a true free market solution, they're going to have to start using the base layer chain more and be willing to pay transaction fees that are large enough to incentivize miners choosing their transactions as the priority. Miner incentives are everything. In my view, you can't possibly be bullish Bitcoin long term and accept that miners are going to secure the network out of the goodness of their hearts. Miner Profitability (BitInfoCharts) It is currently more profitable to mine Bitcoin than it was at this time last year. But the longer term trend is still horrendous. In my opinion, it's more likely that we'll see BTC's price appreciation alleviate this problem post-halving than transaction fees next year. That means miners with the right mix of both production and HODL stack will outperform the ones that can't keep up with global hash growth. CleanSpark is currently my top miner holding. Final Thoughts At the end of the quarter, CleanSpark had $761.6 million in total assets and just $74.1 million in total liabilities. The company has clearly been funding growth with dilution and that has been a risk that I've pointed out in previous coverage. CEO Zach Bradford has indicated that the company will start using BTC for expenses again. The only question is what will the price of BTC be when CleanSpark makes those sales. Personally, I think CleanSpark has done a nice job navigating crypto winter and I think it's an essential holding for the upcoming Bitcoin bull run. That said, don't forget to take some profit along the way and manage positions responsibly.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4655512-cleanspark-well-positioned-for-future?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20942400.jpeg
20942236,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4655511-bitq-bullish-exposure-to-crypto-stocks-one-etf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1701474290,BITQ: Bullish Exposure To Crypto Stocks In One ETF,"Summary The Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF invests in stocks tied to the crypto economy. The fund is benefiting from improved sentiment towards the sector, with a growing recognition that crypto represents a legitimate alternative asset class. BITQ has outperformed Bitcoin year-to-date and is a good option for investors to gain exposure to crypto stocks. The Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ) invests in stocks tied to the crypto across Bitcoin miners, blockchain technology, exchanges, and fintech players. The idea is that the leading companies in the segment could outperform underlying digital asset prices by leveraging opportunities in the emerging digital economy. 2023 has been defined by a resurgence of crypto, led by strong momentum in the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) currently trading at an 18-month high. There is a growing recognition that this is a legitimate alternative asset class while adoption in areas like payments remains in the early stages. Favorably BITQ has outperformed BTC year-to-date and we expect that trend to continue. Data by YCharts What is the BITQ ETF? BITQ technically tracks the ""Bitwise Crypto Innovators 30 Index"". The rules-based methodology for security selection identifies companies recognized as industry pure-plays that derive more than 75% of their revenue related to crypto, or have 75% of their net assets in crypto balance sheet holdings. This tier representing approximately 85% of the fund includes crypto-mining firms, crypto-mining equipment suppliers, and crypto-related financial services companies. The smaller second tier of holdings adds more diversified large-cap companies with some implicit business initiatives aimed at capturing opportunities within the crypto economy or are seen as important to the ongoing development of the industry. The portfolio overall features 29 stocks through an adjusted market cap weighting methodology tilted towards the pure-play crypto stocks. source: Bitwise BITQ Portfolio Going through the current holdings , crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc ( COIN ) is the largest current holding with a 14% weighting. What we like about COIN is the sense that the company is poised to capture market share as a specialist in this segment following several ""crypto scandals"" in recent years including the collapse of ""FTX"" and even the ongoing SEC investigation of a competitor ""Binance"". In many ways, COIN's strong point is that it plays by the book in terms of keeping tight U.S. regulations which is likely the path forward for the crypto market gaining adoption. In our view, We wouldn't say COIN's importance to the industry justifies its place as the top holding in BITQ. Microstrategy Inc ( MSTR ) is the next largest holding with a 13% weighting. In this case, the company is a pioneer in the sector by investing heavily in Bitcoin over the last several years, accumulating a balance sheet position last reported at 174,530 BTC, with an implied market value of $6.7 billion. By this measure, the stock's value is tied to the performance of BTC, and investors within the BITQ ETF indirectly capture that same exposure. source: Bitwise Down the list, several Bitcoin mining stocks are featured. Companies like Marathon Digital Holdings Inc ( MARA ), Riot Platforms Inc ( RIOT ), and Bitfarms Inc ( BITF ) among others build out the infrastructure necessary to receive newly minted Bitcoin from the blockchain protocol based on its share of directed processing power. We've covered several of these names with bullish articles and the takeaway is that the mining industry has evolved into a big business. MARA, for example, is forecast to reach $350 million in revenue this year at current BTC prices with a positive consensus EPS estimate. In many ways, the main attraction of the BITQ ETF is this basket of mining stocks as likely the most well-positioned group of companies to benefit from climbing Bitcoin and crypto prices. From the chart below, the majority of mines have outperformed the price of BTC this year considering the combination of operating and financial leverage. Data by YCharts Finally, we can bring up some of the tier-2 non-pure-play crypto stocks included in the fund. Among the smaller holdings, we find names like Bank of New York Mellon ( BK ), Visa Inc ( V ), Mastercard Inc ( MA ), and PayPal Holdings Inc ( PYPL ) which have at least embraced blockchain technology and play an important role in facilitating industry development. We'd also say that these types of stocks add a layer of quality to the fund, which can limit volatility and help reduce risk at the margin. What's Next For BITQ? We like to use Bitcoin as the benchmark for crypto and even consider it the ""gold standard of cryptocurrencies"", but it's important to recognize the broader sector has several moving parts. Alternative cryptocurrencies between Ether ( ETH-USD ), XRP ( XRP-USD ), and even the surprise outperformer this year in Solana ( SOL-USD ) have all gained momentum amid the renewed bullish sector sentiment. The understanding is that a diverse range of blockchain applications between decentralized finance, tokenization of physical assets, and even the aspect of an alternative payment system beyond the traditional financial sector are here to stay. Key developments this year from the strengthening regulatory framework for crypto and even an expectation for a looming ""Bitcoin ETF"" to track the spot market price of BTC have added to the credibility of the segment fueling further investments and adoption. We expect those trends to continue. Data by YCharts At the same time, the big risk especially when it comes to the BITQ ETF is that the favorable crypto pricing environment reverses. Considering the significant exposure of the fund to mining stocks and even Bitcoin directly through shares of Microstrategy, a bullish outlook on the fund needs higher prices going forward to sustain climbing revenues and earnings potential as a driver of equity prices particularly for those stocks. A regulatory setback or financial market contagion against a deteriorating macro backdrop would carry over volatility and open the door for a deeper correction in the sector. The point here is to say, that crypto and BITQ remain highly speculative, but we still believe that risk can be justified given the upside potential. Just focusing on Bitcoin, a scenario where the price reclaims the 2021 all-time high near $70,000 could drive a significant wave of inflows into crypto-related equities BITQ would participate in. Even with the latest round of momentum, the fund is still down more than -60% from 2022 levels highlighting both the risk in the sector, but also the path forward if the rally continues. Seeking Alpha Alternative Crypto ETFs Keep in mind that there are some alternative ETFs in this space including the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF ( DAPP ), the Global X Blockchain ETF ( BKCH ), as well as the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF ( BLOK ). The reality is that each of these funds features many of the same stocks with varying levels of exposure to particular underlying names. It's hard to claim one fund is ""better"" than another, but our conviction is that all should perform well as crypto prices climb. That said, we believe BITQ strikes the right balance between the targeted exposure to the ""pure-play"" crypto stocks and the effort at diversification with the smaller position in diversified large-cap names. This is in contrast to the BKCH ETF which has technically outperformed in recent months but has a high concentration in just the top four holdings that represent more than 50% of the fund. In other words, the BITQ strategy may be more well-rounded over different market environments to deliver stronger risk-adjusted returns. Data by YCharts Final Thoughts We are bullish on the BITQ ETF which we view as a good option for investors to capture diversified exposure to this important emerging industry. So without picking winners and losers within crypto, BITQ is an easy option to capture the high-level bullish trends. Recognizing the volatile nature of crypto stocks, we believe the fund can complement a broader portfolio.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4655511-bitq-bullish-exposure-to-crypto-stocks-one-etf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20942236.jpeg

According to an order issued by U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby of the U.S. District Court in Utah, the SEC's attorneys could be sanctioned for making ""misleading"" arguments about crypto project Debt Box's alleged efforts to transfer its assets and investors' funds overseas, leading a court to freeze the project's bank accounts. The SEC's ""misrepresentations… undermined the integrity of [the case's] proceedings,"" in addition to causing Debt Box ""irreparable harm,"" Judge Shelby said in an order.  Sanctions are penalties a court imposes on individuals who sign statements they know to be false or otherwise violate court procedures, according to Law.com's legal dictionary. In civil law, sanctions are usually imposed in the form of monetary fines, according to Law.com.  A federal judge first slapped Debt Box with a temporary restraining order, restricting its access to its assets, in August. However, he later dissolved the order after Debt Box demonstrated it had neither moved funds outside the U.S., nor closed its bank accounts two days before a hearing over the SEC's request to freeze its funds, Debt Box's lawyers said in a filing.  The SEC's Utah office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The SEC first sued Debt Box in July, alleging the company schemed to sell unregistered securities called “node licenses,"" beginning in 2021. Debt Box told investors the licenses would mine cryptocurrency that would increase in value, but they were actually minting the crypto themselves using computer code, the SEC alleged in its original complaint.  In Thursday's order, Judge Shelby asked the SEC's attorneys to respond to his findings that their arguments alleging Debt Box had attempted to move its funds overseas lacked context and were not factual. The regulator has two weeks to respond to the inquiry, according to the order.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/12/01/us-judge-warns-sec-over-false-and-misleading-request-in-crypto-case,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a33dce2eb4ec2ca3f0e0cb7d396ac683783d466-3000x1687.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Since the correction, the altcoin has been trading in a tight range around $20 and $21. However, this might not continue for much longer following one crypto analyst’s prediction. An AVAX Bullish Wave Is Rising Crypto analyst Babenski has unveiled their bullish prediction for the AVAX price going forward. According to the analyst, the digital asset could be poised for an incredible run that could break multiple bearish resistances to bring its price to $30. Related Reading: 3 Bitcoin-Like Proof Of Work Altcoins That Could Make You A Millionaire In 2024 Babenski’s analysis hinges on the EMA100 (Exponential Moving Average) which they identify as providing dynamic support for the altcoin. This began during the October rally where prices started rising and AVAX did not lose the EMA100 despite multiple corrections. Source: TradingView.com Even on the 4-hour chart that the analyst presents, the altcoin’s price also touched down toward the EMA100. But once again, this dynamic support held as the price bounced off and continued on its merry way. This suggests a lot of support for the asset at this level. Additionally, the crypto analyst reveals that the AVAX price has also broken out of a bullish pennant. This is shown in the chart as the price resumed its uptrend above $21. This breakout “Looks bullish in short term,” according to the analyst, and could send the price to $30. However, the bullish trend is not the only one that is spinning for the AVAX price. While bulls remain firmly in control, there is still the possibility of the altcoin losing its dynamic support. If this happens and the price drops lower, then Babenski reveals that the next significant support is located just around the $17 price level.

20939337,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563382,1701468052,"Ethereum Price Prediction: Crypto Analysts Reveal Catalyst That Will Drive Price Above $3,500","A crypto analyst has singled out an event that could be the spark that Ethereum needs to hit the price level of $3,500. He believes that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is going to make this run after Bitcoin “gets its shine.” How Ethereum Will Hit $3,500 In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, the CEO and founder of MN Trading, Michaël van de Poppe, alluded to the Ethereum Spot ETF filing by Fidelity in his price prediction of $3,500. The crypto analyst seemed to be suggesting that approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF could propel Ethereum’s price to such heights. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Identifies 3 Key Factors That Will Trigger Parabolic Move His reference to Bitcoin also confirms that this might indeed be van de Poppe’s “thesis.” He spoke about Ethereum “running to $3,500 in Q1 2024” after Bitcoin has had its shine. The “shine” likely refers to the possible approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Some analysts have predicted that there is a 90% chance that a Spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved by January 10, 2024. With this in mind, the crypto analyst possibly believes that approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF could come not long after once the Spot Bitcoin ETF is approved. If that happens, it could spark a massive rally in Ethereum’s price. That could explain why Michaël van de Poppe is predicting Ethereum to run to $3,500. Several asset managers have already applied with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer an Ethereum Spot ETF. However, all eyes seem to be on the SEC’s decision on the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications. This could simply be because a final decision is expected on the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications, unlike Ethereum’s, which still have a longer review process. ETH price steadies above $2,000 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Ethereum Spot ETFs May Not Get The Same Reception Historically speaking, there is reason to believe that Ethereum Spot ETFs might not enjoy the same reception that Spot Bitcoin ETFs have gotten so far. This is based on the fact that there was a stark comparison in the numbers when the futures ETF of both crypto tokens launched. Related Reading: Shiba Inu L2 Shibarium Crosses 4 Million Transactions As Burn Rate Explodes Bitcoin futures ETFs were already in place as of 2021, with ProShares Bitcoin Strategy (BITO) ETF being the first to launch. Meanwhile, Ethereum futures ETFs just launched this year. What is most interesting is the trading volume that BITO saw on its launch date in comparison to all Ethereum futures ETFs on their launch date. BITO is reported to have seen more than $1 billion in trading volume in the first two days of launching. On the other hand, the total trading volume for Ether ETFs on their launch day amounted to just under $2 million.

According to a former mobster turned federal informant, Gene Borrello, who shared a prison cell with Bankman-Fried, the disgraced crypto executive was placed on suicide watch and endured challenging conditions during his time at Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) while awaiting sentencing next year. FTX Co-Founder Subjected To Extortion The details emerged during an interview with crypto blogger Tiffany Fong, where Borrello disclosed the troubling circumstances surrounding Bankman-Fried’s imprisonment. The former detainee recounted how Bankman-Fried was subjected to suicide watch, extortion attempts, and even periods of self-neglect, including refusing to eat or shower for several days. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Approval Date Hinted By Expert: SEC Decision Expected January 5th – 10th, 2024 In an attempt to protect Bankman-Fried from potential harassment or extortion, authorities segregated him from gang members within the prison facility. However, despite these precautions, Borrello’s intervention reportedly foiled an extortion plot against the crypto mogul. Borrello further revealed that he prevented the extortionists from coercing Bankman-Fried into sharing a bunk with them, placing the FTX co-founder in a solitary wing. Additionally, Bankman-Fried’s parents reportedly requested his transfer to the solitary unit to ensure his safety. Drastic Change In Prison? Describing the physical and emotional toll on Bankman-Fried, Borrello highlighted the crypto executive’s frail appearance, likening it to that of an elderly man. Borrello stated on the matter: He has the body of an 80-year-old man. He has, like, no shape to him. When he talks to you, he puts his head down; he’s very timid, he talks very nervously. Borrello also noted Bankman-Fried’s timid demeanor, with the co-founder displaying signs of nervousness during interactions. In one conversation, Borrello confronted Bankman-Fried, stating that he had never been in a physical altercation before and questioned his association with gang members. As reported by our sister site, Bitcoinist, Bankman-Fried received unique treatment in prison, where he allegedly received special privileges for sharing cryptocurrency-related information with prison guards and fellow inmates. However, Borrello’s account offers a contrasting perspective, emphasizing the challenges and vulnerabilities the disgraced executive faced behind bars. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Retests Major Resistance Wall, Will Break Happen? As Bankman-Fried’s sentencing approaches, his time in prison, including allegations of bullying and the ultimate impact on his legal proceedings, continues to draw attention.

CONY aims to provide monthly income distributions and exposure to COIN's upside, with a net long position of around 80%. CONY offers a 4.16% 30-day yield and a 51.97% distribution rate, but there may be hidden risks involved. These risks are primarily concentrated in the options strategy and have left a 20% return gap between CONY and COIN since launch. Introduction This year, YieldMax has launched a full suite of ETFs based around selling call options against high beta (very volatile) stocks like Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ), Tesla, Inc. ( TSLA ), and more. Coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange and financial services company ( only a few other services, honestly ), and as such, is an incredibly volatile stock. This has attracted options traders who seek to profit from the volatility. Enter the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ), one of many covered-call-driven funds YieldMax debuted this past September. Every time I cover YieldMax ETFs, the list seems to grow by a few more tickers. Figure 1 (YieldMax) Last month, I covered TSLY, a sister fund to CONY. If you want to see my coverage of its similar strategy, where I discuss TSLA surprisingly little, check it out here . CONY aims to, just like the rest of the YieldMax funds, provide monthly income distributions and exposure to COIN's upside. The fund managers state that they aim for about 80% price upside, meaning that they are net short 20% or so at any given time. This fluctuates day to day, of course, as the managers trade daily. Figure 2 (YieldMax) With a 4.16% 30-day yield and a 51.97% distribution rate, income investors may be tempted by this fund. Unfortunately, there is more risk than is immediately apparent in CONY, and I am giving it a sell rating for now. It does not merit consideration for an income portfolio, as it has some inherent flaws in its strategy that I do not consider acceptable for investment. The Strategy YieldMax describes the general strategy of their ETFs below in Figure 3. Figure 3 (YieldMax) A ""synthetic covered call"" is options-speak for the capital-efficient strategy of using options to replicate stock exposure. It's capital efficient because synthetic stock exposure can be built using margin to secure the short put being sold. The premium from the sale of the short put is then used to offset the cost of the long call. This means that the actual cash NAV of the fund can be held in treasury bonds, providing a small boost to yield and, assuming they are held to maturity, absolute returns. These are great underlying holdings because they are not volatile and will provide a stable, albeit middling, return without causing large swings in margin maintenance requirements. As for CONY, US Treasuries, or UST, makeup 100% of the underlying holdings, and it still has 4.97% of NAV in cash. This is likely cash held to pay out dividends and to buy-to-close their short options positions should they need to do that instead of rolling for a credit. Keeping options premium in cash, plus some extra to cover losses, is prudent for actively managed funds because when you are trading live options, UST liquidity isn't enough to be competitive on the level investors expect from CONY. Execution matters a lot, and these funds sell thousands of contracts at a time. Liquidity can dry up fast on certain strikes, so having cash available to trade at the right moment is very important. Figure 4 (YieldMax) Note that one of their UST holdings (purchased at a discount, but still with an abysmal yield) is maturing in a month. Hopefully, the managers will be able to participate in a new auction and pick up UST with much higher yields. If you're interested in keeping up with their changes, here is the auction schedule . It is also possible for them to roll into an existing note and buying it at a discount. These new USTs yielding upwards of 5% could give CONY a decent ""yield floor."" No matter what yield they end up with after their change, it is a small buffer for CONY's dividends, as USTs also pay monthly coupons. The bigger the coupons, the less risk the managers will need to take with picking strikes. For this reason, I would absolutely like to see them pick up more recently issued bonds or new bonds from auction next month. As far as the options positions go, if you plot a payoff chart using CONY's current holdings, it looks like this: Figure 5 (OptionsStrat) The shape of the curve at the top is due to the staggered short calls, on 12/8 and 12/22. With the market pricing in a 61% chance of success, this isn't necessarily a ""lotto ticket"" options trade, but it is far from a high probability trade that many folks think of when they think about covered call funds. These are fairly aggressive strikes. For those interested in the ""Greeks"" of the position, here you are. Figure 6 (OptionsStrat) Note that the position has negative Vega, meaning that a rise in implied volatility would work against this position. This means that YieldMax is betting on realized volatility being less than implied volatility. If they're wrong, the position could lose money even if COIN's price goes up. This introduces us to a new risk to consider for all YieldMax funds. Drawdowns CONY is relatively new, meaning that it hasn't had time to experience a severe drawdown. Its underlying stock, COIN, can have very sudden drops. Here is their all-time chart to illustrate. Data by YCharts How underwater investors are, from IPO to now, is easiest to see in the drawdown chart. Figure 10 (Portfolio Visualizer) COIN investors lost 24.15% from 3/31/22-4/30/22. These dates fall within the same timeframe of the current options trades. That would've been a very, very bad time to hold CONY had it been around. This fund would have seen almost the entirety of that drop as well, since it is not properly hedged in any way other than the short call premium, which ends up being distributed to shareholders anyway, so isn't very useful for preserving NAV. This is a risk amplified by CONY's net negative Vega mentioned earlier. CONY did not exist for any of these drawdowns, as it launched in September this year, so we don't have any good data on how it may handle another inevitable swing to the downside. COIN had a max drawdown from Nov. '21 to Dec. 22' of 88.92%. While there would've been some excess returns from sold calls that expired, I wonder how CONY would've done. Because their strategy involves real-time, active intervention in their trades, it's impossible to know what the managers may have done in the past. For this reason, we only have a vague idea on how CONY would've done during these periods. The real question we're all asking: So how's it done so far? Performance Well, it's okay. Underwhelming. Data by YCharts There was a solid period of outperformance for CONY through October and into November, albeit slight outperformance. Note where CONY started falling short, starting a few weeks ago. This is due to CONY's capped upside. Even as COIN ran, CONY would breach its strikes and not be able to participate in any more upside. The greatest risk present here is that with a capped upside and an unhedged downside, there is little to protect CONY from suffering another sharp drawdown in COIN and devastating investors. The best part about holding high beta stocks like COIN is that when they run up, they run up. If you miss out on that upside, you won't be able to recover from the drawdowns. This could lead to ""NAV erosion,"" which is where funds will need to cannibalize their underlying assets in order to pay dividends to investors since their options positions resulted in losses. Data by YCharts As far as dividend performance is concerned, we don't have much data since there have only been two distributions so far. Data by YCharts Dividend-wise, we can expect to see something close to 10% once it evens out. This may change, as holdings change and as COIN changes, but for now, this is what investors should expect. This may change wildly, and I do not expect stability from their distributions. Summary The YieldMax COIN Option Income ETF offers investors an eye-watering distribution yield but comes with risks that make it an unworthy investment for income-seekers. Due to Coinbase's volatile nature and the strategy's capped upside, CONY cannot participate in the same upside COIN investors hold COIN for. The distributions so far have left a 20% gap in total return between the two. Ultimately, I must rate this fund a sell and caution investors about the risks of the CONY's strategy. P.S. How do you pronounce CONY? With TSLY, I say ""tes-lee."" I don't like ""coh-nee"" because it reminds me of the Ugandan militant we associate with 2012. ""koy-nee"" is what I'm currently going with.

However, a new BTC dominance chart shows why the tides are about to turn in favor of altcoins. Bitcoin Crypto Market Dominance Remains Above 50% At this very moment, Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market cap, represents more than 50% of the entire crypto market. On one hand, this makes sense given its regulatory acceptance, first-mover advantage, and significant brand power. On the other hand, there are tens of thousands of altcoins out there and yet BTC is still dominant. Related Reading: A Golden Opportunity For Ethereum? 600% Buy Signal Returns But even Bitcoin dominance goes through cyclical boom and bust phases where it loses its dominance to the rest of the crypto market. This is typically called “altcoin season.” The last one to occur was back in late 2020 into 2021, and it lasted only several months. Before that, the rally that coined the term altcoin season took place all of 2017. With three to four years in between the 2017 rally, the calendar turning toward 2024 puts us yet another year closer to the next altcoin season. This is evident by price action and technical oscillators following sine waves. Sine waves could point to the next alt season | BTC.D on TradingView.com Riding The Wave To The Next Altcoin Season According to Investopedia, a sine wave is an S-shaped geometric waveform that oscillates periodically above and below zero. Sine waves can be used in technical analysis to help identify cyclical patterns in technical indicators and oscillators. In the chart above, the sine wave suggests that indicators are ready to begin rolling over, with the wave overlaid matching the 1M Stochastic almost perfectly. Aside from some chop, the sine waves have followed the ebb and flow back and forth between Bitcoin and altcoin dominance for going on a decade. Related Reading: Howling At The Moon: 23,000% Dogecoin Signal Reawakens If the tool accurately demonstrates the path ahead for Bitcoin dominance, the next altcoin season could be on the way soon enough. Bitcoin is approaching $40,000 and is becoming increasingly expensive for retail investors, who aren’t even paying attention yet to the crypto market. When they do realize how expensive Bitcoin is again, right under their noses, retail investors will search for the “next Bitcoin” frantically, sparking the next altcoin season. The last time these phases occurred, Bitcoin was passing $10,000 in 2017, and $20,000 in 2020. Now in 2023, will $40,000 be the trigger for alts to finally outperform?

The fund's performance heavily relies on the volatility of its underlying stock, Coinbase, which has a history of sharp ups and downs. Investors should consider the correlation between Coinbase's performance and the performance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies when deciding whether to invest in the fund. YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF (CONY) is a covered call fund that sells options on Coinbase (COIN) in order to generate monthly income. The fund has an annualized distribution yield of 52% based on the distributions it has made so far (only two). Distribution Yield of CONY (YieldMax) This might be the best-performing YieldMax fund this year because its NAV is up 24% despite making two large distributions. It's very rare for covered call funds to see this kind of climb when their distribution rate is so high. Data by YCharts Combining the NAV gains with the large distributions it made so far, CONY had total gains of 40% in its short existence of only 3 months. Data by YCharts This looks very encouraging but keep in mind that this is a single-stock based ETF and its performance relies heavily on the performance of its underlying stock which is COIN. This is a very volatile stock that has had some very sharp ups and downs during its short 2-year history, and it's down 62% from its IPO date even though it's up 250% year to date. Data by YCharts Volatility is the bread and butter of a covered call fund, and it can determine how much yield one can get from a fund because covered call funds harvest volatility and that's where the yield comes from. When it comes to volatility, this COIN is highly volatile. Since having its IPO 2.5 years ago, COIN's 30-day volatility dipped below 50% only twice, and both of these instances were short-lived. During the last 2.5 years, the stock's volatility ranged from 50% to 150% with most of the time spent in 60s and 70s. Compare this to VIX which is basically the implied volatility of the S&P 500 index ( SPY ) which ranged from 12 to 35 during the same time and averaged 19. This means selling options on COIN can generate 3 to 6 times as much premium as selling options on the index, but it also comes with a price. Data by YCharts We all saw what happened to another YieldMax fund TSLY ( TSLY ) when it was harvesting Tesla's ( TSLA ) volatility. The fund suffered some large losses when TSLA crashed and didn't participate in most of the upside when the stock recovered quickly, which means it got left behind as it was barely flat in a year when TSLA was up 33%. Data by YCharts I did a back-testing of what would happen if you sold weekly covered calls on COIN at the time of the stock's IPO using E-Trade's ( MS ) back-testing tool. I used weekly options with a delta of 0.35 (about 5-10% out of money) which is the strategy used by the fund so far (which is subject to change since this fund is actively managed). The results showed that although this strategy would have outperformed simply buying and holding COIN, it would still have negative overall results. Harvesting volatility is great when things are going great, but it can quickly turn against you if you are not sufficiently hedged. Back-Testing of COIN Covered Call Strategy (E-Trade Back Testing Tool) Now let us take a look at COIN, which is the underlying stock of CONY. This is a company whose performance is strongly correlated with Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). One might as well say that this fund indirectly writes covered calls on Bitcoin. When Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies perform well, so will Coinbase. When there is less appetite for cryptocurrencies, COIN's revenues also seem to suffer significantly. This means that if you are feeling bearish about Bitcoin (and cryptos in general), this may not be the best fund for you. If you are bullish on cryptos in general, this could be a good fund to harvest their volatility. Data by YCharts One of the biggest challenges with COIN is that the company is struggling to achieve profitability. Analysts see the company posting smaller losses in coming quarters but still no profits on the horizon. During bull markets, investors don't seem to mind that a company isn't profitable, but this can easily change when the tide turns like it did in 2022 and those companies that failed to generate profits got hit the hardest. Profitability of COIN (Seeking Alpha) How do you even hedge a position in CONY? Well, CONY doesn't have an options chain, so you can't just buy CONY puts as a hedge. You could buy puts on COIN, but they would be very expensive for the same reason CONY has such a high dividend yield in the first place: the volatility is too high. If you bought COIN puts a year out at a strike price of $100 (which is $25 below the current price) you'd be out $22 per contract which is very costly and your breakeven price on these puts would be $78. COIN Option Chain (Seeking Alpha) You can also buy a put spreads instead of put contracts and these could also offer you a level of protection which will be more limited. For example, a put spread of $100-$80 would offer you some protection and cost about $7 per contract as opposed to $22 per contract. A put spread will offer you only a limited protection, so you might need to buy as many contracts as needed to cover your full position. For example, if your position size is $5,000, and you bought a put spread that's $25 wide (such as $100-$75 spread), it will only offer you protection up to $2,500 at most (minus the price of the contract). This would cover about 50% of your total position size of $5,000 so you might want to get 2 contracts for full coverage of $5,000. There is another method that can offer you not only limited hedging, but also additional income and let you benefit from the expensiveness of COIN options. You can sell call spreads that are significantly out of money. For example, currently COIN trades at $125 and if you sold $160-165 spread 6 months out, you'd generate about $1.15 per contract. Selling 10 such contracts would give you an additional income of $1,150 and protect your $5,000 position from a downside of 23% (or boost your income by 23%). If the stock moved too high too fast, this position could turn into a loss unless you were able to roll it out to a later date and higher price though. If you applied this type of ""hedging"" you'd have to watch your position very closely to make sure that your hedges aren't working against you. Remember, this fund can offer a very high yield because COIN has high volatility, but this can also work against you when things go south because the same high volatility that gives you high premiums also makes it expensive to hedge your position. After all, it goes both ways. I would actually say that the best hedge is diversifying and keeping a small position. If CONY makes up 50-60% of your entire portfolio, you will have to find a way to hedge but if this fund only makes 2-3% of your total position, you won't need to lose sleep over hedging because even if the entire position goes bust, you won't be losing much. The way I personally play YieldMax ETFs is that I buy equal amounts of each ETF which gives me good coverage of big tech stocks, then I hedge the entire position using QQQ put spreads which are way cheaper than individual stock puts. This way, I don't need to find hedges for each specific position but a hedge for the entire package since I am already diversified. In conclusion, I would hold CONY but make sure that it's a small component of a well-diversified portfolio or find a way to hedge the position so that I won't lose sleep over it. I wouldn't sell or short this fund at the moment, as its good performance can continue for a while.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4655464-cony-best-performing-yieldmax-fund-but-still-risky?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20935281.jpeg

This green monthly close marks its second consecutive green monthly after finishing out October in the green as well. With this trend now complete, let’s take a look at Dogecoin’s historical performance when it has notched two consecutive green monthly closes. Two Green Dogecoin Monthly Closes The two consecutive green monthly closes for Dogecoin are significant due to how the price has performed when this has happened in the past. Given the meme coin’s highly volatile nature, it is not every time that it notches two consecutive green monthly closes and this could be very bullish for the price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETF In January 2024: A New Player Just Joined The Game For example, back toward the end of 2020, the meme coin had closed out the months of November and December in the green. While at the time, it did not seem relevant, this would signal the start of one of the most impressive rallies in crypto so far. Dogecoin took the green monthly closes and ran with it and the next few months would be characterized by nothing but green. The DOGE price went from around $0.008 following the green monthly close to over $0.05 in the next four months. Each of these four months would see the meme coin close in the green as its price continued to rally. If this trend were to repeat itself once again, then the DOGE price could be gearing up for another massive run. DOGE completes two green monthly closes | Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview.com Can DOGE Replicate This Success? Dogecoin has historically been good with following trends, which bodes well for the current performance. However, there have been times when there has been a deviation from this trend despite marking the two consecutive monthly closes. In September and October 2022, Dogecoin had closed out both months in the green. However, the next few months would turn out to be quite bearish for the price. In the end, the meme coin saw two red monthly closes before seeing another monthly close. Related Reading: Bitcoin 65% Crash Possible? $54 Million In Buy Orders Pile Up At $12,000 A major difference between the 2022 trend and the 2023 trend though is the fact that 2022 was quite bearish following the FTX collapse while 2023 is very bullish with the Bitcoin price recovering again. With investor greed at a very high level, Dogecoin could continue to rise. As crypto analyst Ali Martinez points out, the meme coin is currently seeing a lot of resistance at $0.087. However, once it breaks through this resistance, then the DOGE price could double from here.

The suit, dated Nov. 28 and filed in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida, in Miami, alleges that Ronaldo ""promoted, assisted in, and/or actively participated in the offer and sale of unregistered securities in coordination with Binance.""  The action purports to represent ""consumers who purchased unregistered securities offered of sold by Binance."" The lead plaintiff was identified as Michael Sizemore, a California resident who allegedly bought unregistered securities from Binance ""after being exposed to some or all of defendant's misrepresentations and omissions regarding the Binance platforms.""  ""Mr. Ronaldo’s promotions solicited or assisted Binance in soliciting investments in unregistered securities by encouraging his millions of followers, fans, and supporters to invest with the Binance platform,"" the legal filing said.  The suit could add to a growing list of legal matters at Binance. In June, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance, the operating company for Binance.US and founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao on allegations of violating federal securities laws. Last week, in a separate case, Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion to settle charges brought by U.S. prosecutors related to alleged violations of breaking sanctions and money-transmitting laws.  Ronaldo partnered with Binance in 2022 in the creation of a non-fungible token (NFT) collection, featuring animated figures depicting moments from his career.  He is accused of ""soliciting investments in unregistered securities by encouraging his millions of followers, fans, and supporters to invest with the Binance platform.""  ""Mr. Ronaldo’s promotions were published on public websites, television and social media accounts accessible to plaintiffs nationwide, including in Florida,"" the suit reads. ""On information and belief, in exchange for his services, Mr. Ronaldo received a substantial total compensation package which likely included compensation in the form of digital assets transmitted through the Binance platforms.""  The suit cited prior SEC warnings that virtual tokens may be securities, and that celebrities must disclose when they are getting paid to promote securities.

AVAX, HNT, BLUR and RUNE were among the best performers with doubling prices in a month.  The widening breadth of the crypto rally indicates ""alt season,"" ByteTree said.  November brought explosive gains for altcoins as a wide range of smaller cryptocurrencies outperformed bitcoin [BTC], prompting calls for an altcoin season.  The native token of Avalanche [AVAX] surged 97% over the past month, the most among large-cap digital assets, benefitting from news that finance giants JPMorgan and Apollo are using the network to test real-world-asset tokenization.  Transaction volumes on Avalanche's blockchain also experienced an uptick over the month, recording its highest weekly traffic of $2 billion in transactions in a year, a report by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock pointed out.  The report also noted a sizable increase in inflows to Avalanche over the last two quarters of the year, with $79 million in net inflows in Q3 and $56 million in Q4 through late November, helping rejuvenate the ecosystem.  Internet-of-things communications protocol Helium [HNT] also stood out with a 110% rally last month, CoinDesk data shows. Other notable best-performers include non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur's token [BLUR] and decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol THORchain's native crypto [RUNE], both doubling in prices through the month.  Altcoins outperform as BTC grinds above $38,000  Bitcoin [BTC], meanwhile, booked a 10% monthly gain, spending most of the month between $34,000 and $38,000. After multiple previous breakout attempts being sold quickly, the largest crypto by market cap apparently jumped above the range on the last day of November, hitting a fresh yearly high of $38,800.  The second-largest crypto, ether [ETH], increased 13% in November, stabilizing above the $2,000 level for the first time since April and consolidating there.  Slowing momentum for large-cap cryptocurrencies prompted investors to rotate profits into riskier corners of the digital asset market.  This is visible in CoinDesk Market Index sector performances, which posted larger gains than BTC. The culture and entertainment sector index [CNE] – a proxy for NFT and metaverse tokens – and DeFi sector index [DCF] rose 42% and 39% over the past month, respectively.  The widening breadth of the crypto rally signals that we are in the midst of an ""altcoin season,"" investment advisory firm ByteTree said in a report this week. Market observers refer to altcoin seasons as periods when smaller cryptos outperform bitcoin.  ByteTree data showed that about half of the top 100 cryptocurrencies are in neutral or rising trend versus BTC.

Cardano Is Facing On-Chain Resistance At Current Price Levels According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, there appears to be key on-chain resistance around the $0.38 mark. In on-chain analysis, levels are judged to be “resistance” or “support” based on whether they host the cost basis of a significant number of investors or not. The cost basis here naturally refers to the price at which a Cardano investor bought their tokens. This price is obviously an important level for any holder, as the asset’s spot value retesting this level could mean a potential swing in their profit-loss situation. Related Reading: Polygon Whales Go On 120 Million MATIC Buying Spree, Rally Soon? Because of this reason, holders are particularly sensitive when such a retest happens and as such, they may be more likely to show some kind of move. What kind of move this would be, though, depends on the prior profit-loss situation of the investor. Investor psychologically works so that if the trader had been holding a profit before this retest, they might want to take a further gamble at it, as they could believe this same price level would be profitable again in the future. Similarly, the holder might lean towards selling instead if the retest is happening from below since they would fear a scenario where the price declines again and they dip back into losses. Now, here is what the various Cardano price ranges are looking like right now in terms of the concentration of investors or addresses who acquired their coins at them: Looks like the current price range is offering a significant amount of impedance to the price | Source: IntoTheBlock on X In the above graph, the size of the dot represents the amount of investors who bought inside the range. As mentioned before, investors are likely to show some reaction when the price retests their cost basis, so if a large number of them share their cost basis inside the same range, the effect that the market would feel from the retest would also be equally sizeable. From the chart, it’s visible that the ADA price range between about $0.37 and $0.39 has a cost basis of over 319,000 addresses, which acquired a total of 7.19 billion ADA at these levels. Related Reading: Chainlink Signal Resurfaces: Is Another 31% Rally Coming? This is the same range that Cardano has been retesting recently and has been struggling to break out of. It would appear that the reason behind this might be the resistance being offered by the sellers who are attempting to exit at their break-even prices. Given the large scale of this resistance wall, it would be tough for the cryptocurrency to mow through it and gain some distance. If the asset can achieve this, though, then the zone might turn into support instead and provide some solid ground for a move towards higher levels. ADA Price Cardano is trading around the $0.38 level right now, which is right in the middle of the resistance wall.

The latest inspiration is one of the most influential figures in crypto, at least among those obsessed with memes: Elon Musk, whose controversial words this week inspired the birth of hundreds of tokens, with some hitting market capitalizations exceeding $25 million.  GFY, short for ""go f--k yourself,"" led the pack. The token was issued by someone soon after Musk, in an interview Wednesday, shot those words toward advertisers who are withdrawing from his social network X.  More than 250 GFY tokens have since been issued on several networks, mainly on Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain and Arbitrum. The market capitalizations of these vary from under $15,000 to more than $25 million – with the largest one attracting $19 million in trading volumes in the past 24 hours from some 4,000 holders.  Anyone can issue tokens on Ethereum (or other blockchains) with relative ease. It generally costs just a few cents. And they can be issued on decentralized exchanges basically instantly, with essentially guaranteed liquidity for anyone wanting to trade them given how DEXs operate.  Scores of TRUCK tokens popped up, another apparent nod to Musk, whose carmaker Telsa debuted its Cybertruck this week.  These followed GROK, a token seemingly named the GrokAI chatbot built by xAI, a division of X. That token surged more than 10,000% after issuance in early November, only to drop 50% after its developer was linked to failed projects.  Why are meme coins so popular?  Such tokens are the latest in a year that has seen crypto traders bet on tokens related to late investor Charlie Munger and hamster races. Some professional investors say meme coins and their narratives will always remain a part of the crypto ecosystem.  ""Meme coins are huge parts of the crypto trading landscape, whether we like it or not,"" James Wo, founder of crypto fund DFG, said in an interview conducted over Telegram. ""While the biggest currencies like bitcoin and ether have very low volatility, it's only natural that traders will look for opportunities elsewhere.""  Wo added: ""Meme trading is a risky way to try to seek excessive return, but when it pans out, the upside can be huge. So, even in a bear market, some of the meme coins will have large up-swing, even if it's just short-term.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ARB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/01/elon-musk-inspired-go-f-k-yourself-cybertruck-tokens-surge-among-microcap-punters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/702a2cc1cc844573f4227b83bd10ff58853bc38b-640x360.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Hoffman – an ETF veteran – spent over 17 years at investment manager Invesco, first as the director of ETF institutional sales and capital markets at Invesco PowerShares Capital Management, before moving into an adviser role and most recently, leading the Americas, ETF and indexed strategies team.  “The Grayscale team is thrilled to have John Hoffman join us as Managing Director and Head of Distribution and Strategic Partnerships. John has a wealth of industry and ETF expertise, which will be invaluable to our team and clients, especially during this exciting time at Grayscale,” Dave LaValle, Global Head of ETFs at Grayscale said.  Invesco is one of the biggest issuers of ETFs in the U.S. with currently over 200 ETFs traded on U.S. markets and roughly $425 billion in assets under management (AUM).  The company recently suffered another big departure. Anna Paglia, who served as global head of ETFs, indexed strategies, SMAs and models at Invesco for the past seven years, left to join State Street Global Advisors - the investment management division of State Street - as executive vice president and chief business officer.

Experts have now issued bold predictions, with Bloomberg exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert James Seyffart pinpointing the potential approval window from January 5th to January 10th. The significance of this timeframe has sparked excitement within the cryptocurrency community, as the approval could mark a major milestone for the industry. However, experts emphasize that failure to approve during this window could have significant implications for the SEC and potential ETF applicants. Bitcoin ETF Approval Expected On January 8th According to James Seyffart, any potential approval orders for the Bitcoin (BTC) ETF are likely to occur on Monday, January 8th, Tuesday, January 9th, or Wednesday, January 10th. Seyffart and expert Eric Balchunas estimate a 10% chance or less that the approval will fall outside this window. Furthermore, Seyffart believes that failure to approve the ETF during the predicted window could indicate a significant shift in the SEC’s stance on cryptocurrency-related financial products. This would suggest that either SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and the regulator have taken an aggressive approach or believe the market is not ready for a spot Bitcoin ETF. In the latter scenario, it is possible that ETF applicants such as ARK Invest and 21Shares have voluntarily withdrawn their applications with assurances of future consideration. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Explores The Hype: Are These The Best 2 AI Altcoins? Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, believes that if the predicted approval window holds true, there will be an intense marketing battle among Bitcoin spot ETF issuers. Long highlights that the spotlight will be on these issuers as they compete for investors’ attention and navigate the post-approval landscape. This development is expected to generate excitement among mainstream investors, with many expressing curiosity about Bitcoin’s resurgence following previous periods of doubt. The potential approval timing aligns with the April halving event and the US presidential election, adding further intrigue to the market dynamics. BTC Hits New Yearly High Amidst High Probability Of Approval According to insider sources, the SEC has conducted extensive meetings with Bitcoin spot ETF issuers. These discussions have indicated a high probability of approval, with a reported 99% confidence level. The SEC is said to meticulously review all applications, ensuring that every detail is thoroughly examined and all necessary requirements are met. In the meantime, Grayscale, a prominent cryptocurrency asset management firm, is actively pursuing the possibility of being the first to offer a conversion-based ETF, contingent on a court decision. Related Reading: 300 Million Dogecoin (DOGE) Moved To Robinhood As Price Swells Moreover, Bitcoin has recently achieved a new yearly high, solidifying its position as the leading cryptocurrency in the market.

Presently, BTC has surpassed the $38,800 mark, surpassing its previous milestone by over $400. The next target in sight is the $40,000 level, which has not been reached since April 2022. Over the past 24 hours, the bullish momentum has remained strong, with BTC extending its gains by 2.9%, and over the past 7 days, it has seen a 1.7% increase. As the date of the ETF approvals approaches, it remains to be seen how Bitcoin’s price will respond.

20931150,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563443,1701450052,300 Million Dogecoin (DOGE) Moved To Robinhood As Price Swells,"The Meme-based cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently experienced a significant increase in whale transactions during an improvement in the crypto asset’s price. 300 Million Dogecoin (DOGE) Dumped In Crypto Exchange Data from the on-chain crypto tracker Whale Alert recently revealed that a massive amount of Dogecoin (DOGE) was transferred to Robinhood. This whale transaction has attracted the interest of traders and investors in the larger cryptocurrency space. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Highest Transactions Count Ever Due DRC20 Madness According to the crypto tracker, the transfer was orchestrated by an unknown wallet address earlier today. The wallet address identified as DDuXG.ruc1wwKF sent about 300 million DOGE to the cryptocurrency trading platform Robinhood. The post read: 300,000,000 #DOGE (25,033,123 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Robinhood. With the current price of Dogecoin, the whale transaction is valued at approximately $25 million. The whale moved the substantial Dogecoin haul to Robinhood for a comparatively low network cost of just $0.18. This is most likely by taking advantage of times when fees and congestion were low. The transfer of DOGE to Robinhood suggests that the whale is looking to sell the tokens, igniting speculation in the larger cryptocurrency market. However, it seems that the meme-based cryptocurrency’s price increase runs counter to the tokens being dumped on exchanges. Currently, the price of DOGE is sitting at $0.0839, indicating an over 2% increase in price in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, its market capitalization is also reflecting the same percentage rise at $11.9 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. A similar whale transaction was also flagged by the on-chain tracker recently. In October, a similar transaction of 300 million DOGE tokens occurred thrice, while last month also saw a similar transaction twice. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin About To Reverse? Key Factors To Watch Large-scale individual transactions usually come with the danger of crashes due to fast liquidations or market manipulation. However, there is no solid evidence that the whale transaction had any impact on the token’s price. The Crypto Asset’s Holders Increases Significantly Dogecoin has shown a significant uptick in its total number of holders lately. Analytics firm IntoTheBlock revealed that the total number of addresses holding a balance exceeded 5 million this week, and reached a high of 5.02 million on November 27. A major factor contributing to the rise in new Dogecoin addresses is the cryptocurrency’s increasing adoption and interest. The on-chain analytics firm also revealed that the numbers have been increasing gradually since the start of the year. “This recent activity is most likely driven by Dogecoin “Doginals”, which don’t require a significant on-chain balance of $DOGE,” IntoTheBlock said.

42391941,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxojT,1701447316,North Korean Hackers Lazarus Group Stolen $3B in Cryptocurrency,"(Soohwan Oh, CoinDesk Korea) - North Korea-linked hacker organization Lazarus Group has stolen $3 billion in cryptocurrency over the past six years, according to a report by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.  The report released on Thursday reveals that in 2022 alone, the group plundered $1.7 billion in cryptocurrency, likely to fund North Korean projects.  Blockchain data analysis firm Chainalysis indicates that out of this total, $1.1 billion was stolen from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. A September report published by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as part of its Analytic Exchange Program (AEP) also highlighted Lazarus's exploitation of DeFi protocols.  The U.S. Treasury Department introduced new sanctions against North Korea's cyber activities, adding 'Sinbad' to the Office of Foreign Assets Control's specially designated sanctions list. Sinbad has been implicated in laundering the cryptocurrencies stolen by the Lazarus Group.  The group is known to have used Sinbad's mixer services to hide the origins of the stolen funds. Such mixers obscure individual transaction trails by blending multiple users' transactions.  Lazarus Group's specialty is fund theft. In 2016, they hacked the Bangladesh Central Bank, stealing $81 million. In 2018, they hacked the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck, diverting $530 million, and attacked the Central Bank of Malaysia, stealing $390 million.

The layer-2 solution built for Shiba Inu’s ecosystem just saw transactions spike an astounding 4,400%, registering 748,230 transactions in the past 24 hours. Numbers like this demonstrate the sheer adoption rate of Shibarium, and investors are left wondering if high valuations for the tokens on the Shiba Inu ecosystem are inevitable. Shibarium Transactions Explode Over 4,400% In One Day Shibarium went live in August and has become the go-to platform for SHIB whales and investors. Shibarium recently crossed the 4 million transaction mark, but it looks like the run isn’t stopping anytime soon.

According to data from Shibariumscam, there were 748,230 transactions in the past 24 hours, the highest ever recorded since its launch. Notably, the transaction count on the network has been on the rise in the past week, as it reported over 43,000 transactions On November 23. At the time of writing, the total transaction count now stands at 5.968 million and is steadily approaching the 6 million milestone. SHIB price at $0.0000083 | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com What This Means For SHIB And BONE Prices The massive increase in Shibarium transactions is hugely bullish for SHIB and BONE prices. With more activity and utility on the network, demand for the native tokens should rise. Even before the platform went live, SHIB has been known to react to updates regarding the platform. As it stands, a larger part of SHIB’s utility is now tied to the adoption and use of Shibarium. BONE is also of this sentiment regarding Shibarium. Apart from its utility as the governance token on the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange (DEX), BONE is also used to pay gas fees on the Shabarium network. The more people buy, sell, and trade on the network, the higher BONE’s price can climb. As a result, the hype around Shibarium’s launch in August saw the crypto spike over $1.7 for a few hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETF In January 2024: A New Player Just Joined The Game It would seem that both SHIB and BONE have reacted positively to the recent transaction surge on Shibarium, among other things. According to data from Coinmarketcap, SHIB is up by 1.45% in the past 24 hours, while BONE is up by 2.59% in the same timeframe. However, despite the constant spikes this year, both tokens are still in the negative in a larger timeframe, down by 9.89% and 18.64% in a yearly timeframe. Due to the recent spike in Shibarium transactions, many SHIB and BONE holders are optimistic that new all-time highs are on the horizon for these tokens. SHIB is trading at $0.000008315 at the time of writing and it would need to perform a 930% gain to reach its all-time high of $0.00008616. BONE, on the other hand, is currently trading at $0.6262 and would need to perform gains of 2375% to reach its current all-time high of $15.50.

20927965,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563423,1701442816,Crypto Analyst Explores The Hype: Are These The Best 2 AI Altcoins?,"Two AI-focused projects have recently garnered significant attention: Render Network (RNDR) and Bittensor (TAO). These projects, while distinct in their objectives and execution, are at the forefront of integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Analyst Crypto Stream has analyzed the two most hyped AI projects in this cycle and tried to answer the question: “Which one is the true king of AI coins?” Render Network (RNDR): A Leap In GPU Rendering Crypto Stream highlights that Render Network addresses a critical need in the current digital era: the demand for GPU computing power. Industries ranging from filmmaking to AI research are constantly seeking more computational resources, a need that even major tech giants struggle to meet. Render Network ingeniously tackles this issue by enabling individuals with GPU resources to monetize their idle computing power. As Crypto Stream puts it, “Render Network is not just optimizing resource utilization but is fundamentally changing the dynamics of GPU computing power accessibility.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Who Sold The Bitcoin Top Reveals How To Buy And Sell At The Perfect Time The economic model of RNDR has evolved since its inception as an ERC-20 token in 2017. Migrating to the Solana blockchain, the project introduced a burn mechanism, where RNDR tokens equivalent to the fiat value of GPU power purchased are burnt, potentially reducing the token supply over time. “This burn mechanism,” Crypto Stream notes, “is a fascinating aspect of RNDR, adding a deflationary characteristic to its tokenomics.” Discussing RNDR’s market performance, Crypto Stream observes that the token’s peak at over $7 in 2022 and its current price at $3.49 reflect its substantial growth. With a market capitalization of $1.3 billion and a fully diluted valuation of $1.8 billion, RNDR has already experienced a significant 10x increase this year. “We’re not early in the game with RNDR, but its potential in the AI space still makes it a project worth watching,” advises Crypto Stream. At press time, RDNR was trading at $3.56, slightly below the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level at $3.60. Bittensor (TAO): Democratizing AI Model Deployment Bittensor’s aim to decentralize the deployment of machine learning algorithms stands in contrast to RNDR. It aims to challenge the dominance of tech giants in AI, such as OpenAI and Meta, which control the best AI models, by creating a platform for trading specialized AI models. “Bittensor is opening doors for smaller research teams globally, allowing them to contribute and monetize their specialized AI models,” states Crypto Stream. This specialized focus actively caters to a variety of needs, including non-English languages and niche industries, often overlooked by larger players. Related Reading: 3 Bitcoin-Like Proof Of Work Altcoins That Could Make You A Millionaire In 2024 Crypto Stream is particularly impressed by Bittensor’s tokenomics, which are inspired by Bitcoin’s model. “With a total supply mirroring Bitcoin’s, no premine or ICO, and a halving cycle every four years, TAO’s economic design is both robust and promising,” he comments. Approximately 6 million TAO tokens are currently in circulation, with the token trading near its all-time high of $304. “TAO’s current market cap of $1.8 billion and an FDV exceeding $6 billion signify its growing prominence, though much of its supply is yet to be released into the market,” Crypto Stream added. Which One Is The Best AI Altcoin? Crypto Stream concludes that both RNDR and TAO offer unique and complementary solutions to the AI and crypto sector. RNDR’s focus is on solving the hardware problem by leveraging unused GPU power, while TAO addresses the software side by enabling a marketplace for AI models. “It’s hard to declare a definitive leader in the AI token space,” Crypto Stream reflects, “as both RNDR and TAO bring innovative solutions to the table. RNDR’s burn feature and TAO’s Bitcoin-like tokenomics each have their own appeal, targeting different needs within the AI and crypto markets.” Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com",POSITIVE,ICO | RNDR,ALTCOIN | ICO | MARKET | BITTENSOR | RNDR,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/crypto-analyst-hype-best-2-ai-altcoins/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42391949,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxp3z,1701440159,Gauging Spot Bitcoin ETF's Impact on Price Volatility,"Spot ETFs could reduce the influence of crypto whales in the market, helping bitcoin become less volatile, analysts said.  In traditional markets, spot ETFs tend to boost liquidity in the underlying asset.  One observer said volatility may remain high if the expected ETFs involve ""cash creation.""  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is widely expected to greenlight one or more exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest directly in bitcoin [BTC] rather than in futures tied to the cryptocurrency.  Analyst consensus is that approval will have a bullish impact on prices. Analysts disagree, however, on whether approval will subdue bitcoin's notorious price volatility, which has dented its appeal as a haven asset.  While the Bitcoin blockchain is decentralized, its token, BTC, is concentrated in the hands of a relatively small number of owners, known as whales. Because of the size of their holdings, these whales hold great influence over prices, often triggering violent swings. A spot ETF, which is supposed to track the value of the underlying assets closely, could trim their influence by broadening the owner base.  ""A spot ETF would provide bitcoin exposure to a much wider swath of market participants, including institutional investors and financial advisors,"" Nate Geraci, the president of registered investment adviser The ETF Store, said in an interview conducted over direct messaging on X. ""A deeper pool of bitcoin investors via the ETF wrapper could theoretically help lower volatility since there would be a greater number and diversity of investors. That should make it more difficult for larger bitcoin whales to push prices around.""  According to estimates from Galaxy Digital, the addressable market size of a U.S. bitcoin ETF could be $14 trillion in just one year after the spot ETF launch, and $39 trillion in the third year.  More liquidity  Such a strong uptake could boost liquidity in the underlying asset, ensuring less volatile trading conditions where prices don't fluctuate rapidly. Liquidity refers to the ability of a market to absorb large orders at stable prices.  ""Volatility tends to drop as the space matures, more institutional liquidity and infrastructure develops, and the asset acclimates to normalcy,"" Richard Rosenblum, co-founder and president at crypto liquidity provider GSR, said over Telegram.  In the equity markets, an increase in ETF ownership tends to boost liquidity in the underlying stocks, according to a 2018 paper by Mehmet Saglam, associate professor of finance at the Carl H. Lindner College of Business at the University of Cincinnati; Tugkan Tuzun, an economist at the Federal Reserve Board and Russ Wermers, associate professor of finance at the Smith School of Business.  ""Using several measures of liquidity, we find that ETFs increase the liquidity of their underlying stocks. We find that illiquidity measures, eﬀective spreads, quoted spreads, Amihud, and implementation shortfall all increase when the ETF ownership of the stock goes down,"" according to the paper, which examined S&P 500 and Nasdaq stocks.  ""Examining the price dynamics over large order executions, we find that one primary channel of higher liquidity is due to arbitrageurs trading against potential mispricings between the ETF and the basket of underlying stocks,"" the paper said.  Arbitrageurs take offsetting positions in two markets to profit from pricing differences between them. For instance, if an ETF trades at a discount to the value of the underlying stocks, an arbitrageur will buy the ETF and sell underlying stocks, effectively adding liquidity to the underlying assets.  Volatility due to cash creation  Laurent Kssis, an ETF expert and crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital, takes the opposing position, arguing that spot ETFs could become a source of BTC price volatility.  ETFs are created and redeemed in kind or in cash. The widely used in-kind creation involves authorized participants (APs) depositing a basket of securities with the issuer in exchange for new ETF units. Under cash creation, APs provide cash and the issuer purchases the actual asset.  According to Kssis, in cash creation, the issuer is exposed to the difference between the prices at which assets have been acquired and the daily reference price at which the net asset value (NAV) is calculated.  ""We need a reference price where we audit the fund to calculate the NAV,"" Kssis said in a Telegram interview. ""With in-kind creations, APs purchase assets and deliver them to the issuer. With cash creations, if the issuer manages to buy them cheaper, then it makes a little profit, but if it buys them higher, it coughs up the excess.""  ""Hence, at the time of fixing, you will have more arbitrageurs trading around that time channel and creating volume to either push the market or trade discrepancies between the cash and futures price of bitcoin, effectively creating volatility inadvertently during that period,"" Kssis added.  Recently, there were rumors on the X that the SEC wants the ETF applicants to work through cash creation.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/01/gauging-spot-bitcoin-etfs-impact-on-price-volatility,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/070456bd58e4f31d9e4163ae8862664ca43ea0a2-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20926351,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563415,1701439217,Ethereum ATH: Exploring The Possibility Of Ether’s New Peaks In 2024,"Ethereum (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, is demonstrating robust momentum as its price stages a resurgence, reclaiming levels above $2,000. This bullish trend gains traction concurrently with significant developments in the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulatory authority is engaging in discussions regarding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This pivotal development has injected optimism into the Ethereum market, as the prospect of an ETF introduces new possibilities for mainstream adoption and investment, further fueling the current upward trajectory of Ether’s value. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Ripple: Massive $300 Billion Transfer Sends Crypto Community Into Speculation Ethereum’s Ascending Triangle: Bullish Breakout Potential Over the course of several months, the price of Ethereum has been in a consolidation trend that has resulted in the formation of an ascending triangle. Although the technical formation is bullish by nature, this is only true following a profitable breakout. Trend lines connect the equal highs and higher lows of the ascending triangle configuration. This arrangement indicates that investors are growing more confident and buying the dips at a faster pace. ETHUSD currently trading at $2,066 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Interestingly, today’s charts show there are no “dips” to buy, as Ethereum broke past the vaunted $2,000 level to welcome December on a high note. Ethereum is not only keeping up, but also rising to unprecedented heights. The price of ETH is currently up 3% at $2,100, and investors and enthusiasts are excited about the possibility of a rally to $3,000 or even higher. Ether’s impressive success against Bitcoin, outperforming the alpha cryptocurrency by almost 5%, is a major indicator of this. Important on-chain signals imply that ETH may continue to outperform BTC this month. Fidelity Filing Fuels Ethereum Optimism The first indication of a bullish move was a breakout over the psychological $2,000 barrier, although there has been a lot of see-saw motion around this level. More specifically, ETH is trading between the weekly support level at $1,930 and the high for the second quarter at $2,140. This is the fourth week in a row that this has been happening. #Ethereum Spot ETF filing by Fidelity! Confirms my thesis that after #Bitcoin gets its shine, we’ll see Ethereum running to $3,500 in Q1 2024. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 30, 2023 Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe has voiced his optimism for Ethereum in light of the Fidelity filing. Given this submission, he affirms his conviction that after Bitcoin’s rapid increase, Ethereum is positioned to attain $3,500 throughout the initial quarter of 2024.

The fund has outperformed both Grayscale sister funds GBTC and ETHE during much of 2023. The discount adjustment that I've been using to value GDLC since June is now showing a fund that is priced more in line with what might be fair value. I'm still personally long, but I've now taken some profit in GDLC after what has been a terrific trade. It has been three months since my previous coverage of Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ( GDLC ). This is a fund I've covered three times in the past. Grayscale Digital Large Cap: Plenty of Meat Still On The Bone Grayscale Digital Large Cap: A Potential Arbitrage Opportunity GDLC: Where's The Diversification? Quickly recapping my general thoughts on GDLC; as a diversified crypto asset fund, Grayscale has missed the mark with this product. I think the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ( BITW ) is a better alternative to GDLC if you want exposure to a variety of coins in one ticker. However, because GDLC has been so bad as a diversified crypto investment vehicle, it's actually been more interesting as an arbitrage trade just because of the 96% allocation to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). Data by YCharts Over the last eleven months, we've seen the NAV discounts close in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ). Those arbitrage trades have performed marvelously on top of the asset appreciation from the underlying: Data by YCharts Despite the significant NAV discount closures in GBTC and ETHE this year, GDLC still trades at a 22% discount to net asset value. What I've done in each of my last two GDLC articles is provide a NAV discount adjustment that projects where GDLC shares should be if the crypto held in that fund was valued the same way the crypto held in Grayscale's other funds was valued. Critiquing The Process Just because I might believe Grayscale's BTC and ETH should be valued the same between their funds, that doesn't necessarily mean the market will agree. In the last article, there was a good discussion about why the discount in GDLC should theoretically lag ETHE and GBTC. Quoting a commenter : Bitcoin alone and Ethereum alone have applications on the table ready to be approved to become spot ETFs...not only GBTC and ETHE, but also at several other companies like Blackrock, Fidelity, and 21shares/Ark. So, I think that those are very likely to happen. WILL a spot ETF be approved to convert GDLC which holds also SOL, ADA, and MATIC (Solana, Cardano, and Polygon), I don't know! And that scares me. I don't think it will nearly as easily get approved to be a spot ETF which would exactly mirror the price of all 5 things in it. Frankly, this is a terrific point and the commenter continued that Solana ( SOL-USD ), Cardano ( ADA-USD ), and Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) have all been deemed to be unregistered securities by the SEC. Thus, any closed-end fund that holds them is unlikely to be converted to a spot ETF. I happen to agree with that. However, if GDLC's NAV rate were to still trade at deeply depressed levels even as other Grayscale funds have been successfully converted to spot ETFs, there are things Grayscale could do to counteract that. The company could buy shares on the open market to help close the window. Or it could simply close the fund and distribute the proceeds from asset liquidations - in this instance, holders of GDLC would capture the premium. And since related parties hold about 8% of the fund's shares, there would theoretically be a motivation to do this. Daily BTC Volume (Messari) Given the amount of trading volume each of these currencies has during a typical day, I view it as unlikely that liquidating the 6,200 BTC and 38k ETH in the fund would dramatically impact the value of the fund's assets. But each of these situations is probably unlikely because I don't think they're necessary. In fact, my thesis has already worked. Updating The Discount Adjustment GDLC has had a terrific run over the last several weeks. So much so, that it justifies reassessing where we currently are with this valuation model that I described above. If we do the same thing we've done in the past and zero out the SOL, ADA, and MATIC and focus exclusively on the ETH and BTC in GDLC, a revaluation in line with ETHE and GBTC would discount the Ethereum by 13% and the BTC by 8%. Here's how that adjusted discount would value GDLC shares currently: Asset Asset Price Holdings Per Share $ Value Per Share Adjusted Discount ETH $2,032 0.00241163 $4.90 $4.26 BTC $37,712 0.00039107 $14.75 $11.80 Adjusted rate Share Value $16.06 Source: Grayscale, Author's calculations Given GDLC's closing price of $16.00 on November 29th, we can now reasonably say the fund is trading at fair value, adjusting for the other fund discounts. If, like me, you've been playing this trade purely as an arbitrage, this could be a decent time to start locking in the gain in GDLC. Grayscale Performance (Seeking Alpha) GDLC has outperformed both ETHE and GBTC over the last week, month, 6 months, and year to date. It has been a marvelous trade. In my last GDLC article, I said there was still meat on the bone. Even just a few weeks ago , I felt there was still quite a bit of upside in GDLC. However, after a 20% rip in the last two weeks, there is now much less meat. That doesn't mean one has to sell out of GDLC. There's nothing wrong with holding it from here. But purely from a NAV discount play, I think the achievement has been unlocked. Additional Considerations Even though it looks increasingly like we will get spot ETFs for Bitcoin soon at minimum, cryptocurrencies continue to be among the riskiest of the risk assets. The value of the collateral backing GDLC shares could decline, and in that case, the price of GDLC shares will almost certainly decline as well. There continues to be related party risk as Grayscale's parent company and sister companies own 8% of the fund, while there are still ongoing financial issues with Grayscale's parent company Digital Currency Group. Investor Takeaways In my view, Bitcoin and Ethereum will be higher a year from now. In that scenario, GDLC shares will likely move higher as well. We've experienced quite a bit of excitement for spot ETFs over the last few months. But the fact of the matter is, despite all that excitement, we still don't actually have an approval yet. And as a long-term investment that is designed for asset diversification, GDLC's methodology still leaves quite a bit to be desired. That said, if you like BTC, ETH, and SOL, GDLC may not be a bad option. I wouldn't touch the Grayscale Solana Trust ( GSOL ) even after a 50% selloff. But GDLC could certainly see its NAV window continue to close if ETHE and GBTC get to low-single-digit discounts. I don't see much of a need to wait around for that though with a big size. I'm personally still long GDLC shares. But I have locked in some profit after what has been both a sizeable move up this year and also a discount window that is now more in line with where I believe it should be.",POSITIVE,ADA | BTC | ETH | SOL,ADA | BTC | ETH | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4655382-grayscale-digital-large-cap-fund-achievement-unlocked?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20926319.jpeg

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin rose to $38,800 for the first time since May 2022 during European morning hours on Friday, continuing a strong multimonth run buoyed by expectations of growing institutional demand. The cryptocurrency is up around 2% on the day, having retreated slightly to about $38,600. Global stock markets also witnessed gains, with futures of U.S. gauges S&P 500 and Dow Jones adding 0.17% and Europe's Stoxx 600 advancing 0.52%. The price jumps come as euphoria around a planned spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. heats up and on-chain behavior suggests a significant amount of the asset has been moved to cold storage – indicating demand and a lack of imminent sell pressure.  Microstrategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin (BTC), boosted its holdings in November, buying some 16,130 BTC, worth around $608 million at Thursday's prices. The Michael Saylor-founded software developer bought the bitcoin for around $593.3 million in cash at an average price of about $36,785 apiece, according to a regulatory filing. It now holds 174,530 BTC bought at an average of about $30,252 per coin. The November purchases mark an acceleration in the firm's bitcoin buying activities. As of end-October, MicroStrategy held 158,400 BTC, having acquired 6,607 BTC since the beginning of the third quarter. It's now increased its holdings by over 10% in a month.  The Brazilian Senate approved new income-tax regulations that could mean citizens will face paying up to 15% on earnings from cryptocurrencies held on international exchanges, Yahoo Finance reported Thursday. The regulation, if sanctioned by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, could be effective as of Jan. 1. The bill has been approved by the Chamber of Deputies. Those affected will be Brazilians earning more than $1,200 from foreign exchanges and investment funds with a single shareholder. According to Yahoo Finance, the government set a revenue target of $4 billion for these taxes in the new year.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's price has risen by 35% since mid-October while the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has declined by roughly 70 basis points to 4.3%.  The decline in the so-called risk-free late likely paved the way for investors to cheer the expected launch of a spot BTC ETF early next year.

The magnitude of the whale’s holdings has left many wondering who it might be and the reason for the accumulation. Bitcoin Whale Accumulates Over 10,000 BTC In November In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, popular Bitcoin investor Lark Davis revealed details about the “mystery whale” who had been accumulating Bitcoin. Interestingly, the wallet (bc1qch) had accumulated over 10,000 BTC in November. On-chain data also showed that the wallet currently holds over 12,000 BTC ($460 million). Related Reading: Shiba Inu L2 Shibarium Crosses 4 Million Transactions As Burn Rate Explodes Following this revelation, many began to speculate on who the owner of the wallet was and the reason for such accumulation. Lark suggested that it could be institutional investors looking to “front-run the Spot Bitcoin ETF approval.” Some were of the opinion that it could be one of the Spot Bitcoin ETF filers who were preparing ahead of a possible approval. Irrespective of who the owner was, many felt it was a good sign of things to come for the crypto market. That is because the accumulation showed that there was still a huge demand for the flagship cryptocurrency. One could have also inferred that the whale was possibly loading up their bags ahead of the bull run which some project is around the corner. The bullish sentiment was also ignited by the fact that the wallet had not sent out any BTC since it began accumulation at the end of October. That instantly suggests that the whale was in it for the long term rather than looking to make quick profits. BTC price crosses $38,500 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com BitMEX The Mystery Whale The mystery around who the whale might be seems to have been resolved. The wallet is reported to belong to the crypto exchange BitMEX. The exchange is also said to have been simply moving its Bitcoin holdings to this new wallet, which forms part of the exchange’s cold wallet. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Identifies 3 Key Factors That Will Trigger Parabolic Move This is a real possibility, considering that some of the inflows into the wallet came from a particular BitMEX wallet (bc1qm). ZachXBT, a prominent blockchain investigator, also stated that the wallet belongs to the crypto exchange. He referred to an X post, which noted that the wallet address in question was included in BitMEX’s proof-of-reserves. If so, then there isn’t so much meaning to read into the accumulation. It has become standard procedure for these exchanges to have proof of reserves as evidence of enough liquidity on their platform. These reserves are usually proportional to the users’ assets on the exchange.

Terraform lawyers tried to shift the action to an arbitration process, citing the website's terms of use, according to the Business Times. The lawyers claimed users had foregone the right to trial and to join a class-action suit. The court ruled otherwise.  ""To our knowledge, this is the furthest a class-action suit has progressed in the world,"" Mahesh Rai, a director of Drew & Napier, which represents the claimants, said in an interview. ""Now we are approaching discovery stage.""  The suit was filed in September 2022 by Julian Moreno Beltran and Douglas Gan on behalf of 375 others, who claim they lost a combined $57 million.  The claimants are alleging fraudulent misrepresentation by Terraform Labs, Do Kwon and his co-founders in their promotion of the algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST), which led them to purchase and stake the tokens and hold on to them as UST lost its peg to the U.S. dollar in May 2022 and plunged to less than $0.10.  Terraform also faces charges of fraud in the U.S. brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleges it was selling unregistered securities. In October, Terraform asked for this case to be dismissed on the grounds that the regulator had been unable to make its case.

The asset added nearly 3% in the past 24 hours, mirroring an uptick in global stock markets. Futures of U.S. indices S&P500 and Dow Jones jumped 0.17% higher in premarket trading, while European index Stoxx 600 added 0.52% since Friday’s open.  The price jumps come as euphoria around a planned spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. heats up and on-chain behavior suggests a significant amount of the asset has been moved to cold storage – indicating demand and a lack of imminent sell pressure.  Strength in bitcoin also helped a bump in overall capitalization, which crossed the $1.5 trillion mark on Thursday and has added $400 billion since the start of October.  Strong narratives in artificial intelligence, layer 1 blockchains, and gaming have aided growth in large-cap tokens – with prices of Solana’s SOL and Avalanche’s AVAX more than doubling in the past two months.  Meanwhile, some market watchers said bitcoin could see muted growth as December progresses.  “In terms of seasonality, December is considered a relatively neutral month of the year, adding half the time over the past 12 years,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, said in an email. “The average gain is 30.8%, while the average decline is 12.8%.”",POSITIVE,AVAX | SOL,AVAX | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/01/bitcoin-rises-to-388k-for-the-first-time-since-may-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5644372f4dd3c628f699b3b89c23eae76d3b736-1055x735.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20920708,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563375,1701426250,Shiba Inu Ripple: Massive $300 Billion Transfer Sends Crypto Community Into Speculation,"Surprisingly, unknown whales have managed to move 300 billion Shiba Inu tokens from Binance in one big swoop. The reason for such a significant transfer is questionable given the sheer size of this token migration. Everyone in the cryptocurrency community is wondering who the address owner is and what they’re up to after this unusual move sent shockwaves across the ecosystem. Examining the wallet’s past activity in more detail indicates a pattern of major purchases from Binance that occurred over a few weeks prior to this noteworthy transfer. Related Reading: USTC Explodes 335% In Fresh Bullish Streak – What’s Pushing The Price Up? Shiba Inu Whale Surge: Decoding The Unexpected Spike On Binance Now, the question is: Who is responsible for this enormous transfer? Verified in the immutable ledger of the blockchain, the transaction hash attests to the successful transfer. Despite being a cost-effective maneuver, with a transaction charge of only $3.73, it signifies a substantial change in the meme coin’s distribution. The recent whale accumulation of SHIB is unexpected considering that the volume of major transactions on the chain has supposedly decreased by 90% since early November. SHIB market cap currently at $4.925 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com SHIB Downtrend Sparks Speculation: Unpacking Strategic Moves Over the previous few months, Shiba Inu has experienced frequent losses. There have been rumors circulating that many SHIB holders are losing money. As of this writing, the price of Shiba Inu is $0.000008, down 1.0% in the last 24 hours. Market observers have interpreted this as an indication that the market is gradually shifting from Shiba Inu to other cryptocurrency coins. The aforementioned movement of SHIB has demonstrated activity in recent weeks with a trend of significant purchases from Binance. This pattern points to a potential source of strategic amassing that could affect the coin’s value: provisioning of liquidity, investments, or even planning for additional token burns. For the purpose of increasing scarcity and maybe influencing the coin’s value, token burns—the purposeful destruction of a portion of the cryptocurrency supply—have become a popular practice in some crypto projects. Shiba Inu whale stockpiling is essential to the cryptocurrency’s ability to sustain upward movements. SHIB may benefit from this most recent action, but more could be needed to maintain the meme-coin’s momentum moving ahead. Source: Etherscan In other unexpected news, Upbit, the top cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea, saw a surge in Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens today, amounting to an astounding 84 billion SHIB, or more than $700,000. Related Reading: Mark Your Calendars: Bitcoin To Hit $100,000 By End Of 2024, Standard Chartered Says The movements of today are noteworthy because they make up more than 25% of the SHIB volume on Upbit. This has raised suspicions regarding the intentions of the exchange and whether the large Korean CEX is getting ready for a big development involving Shiba Inus.

20917171,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563361,1701418484,"Bitcoin Price Breaks Above $38,800, These Are The Reasons","The Bitcoin price has risen above $38,000 in the last few hours, and for the first time this year closed a 4-hour candle above this crucial price level – a very bullish sign that BTC could rise further. These are reasons behind BTC’s latest price surge: #1 Anticipation Of Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval The recent uptick in the Bitcoin price can probably be attributed in part to developments around the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart stated on X, “Okay the window for potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval is looking like it’s gonna be between Jan 5 & Jan 10 2024.” This observation follows the SEC’s announcement about publishing the Franklin/Hashdex delays today, December 1. Scott Johnsson, a lawyer at Davis Polk, agreed with Seyffart, “This puts the comment period ending at January 5. Ark/21 Shares deadline on January 10.” Related Reading: 3 Bitcoin-Like Proof Of Work Altcoins That Could Make You A Millionaire In 2024 Moreover, Nate Geraci of ETF Store brought further optimism with his comments yesterday, “Another meeting yesterday between Grayscale & SEC. Absolutely fascinated to see how this all plays out, especially timing of GBTC uplisting vs launch of competing spot BTC ETFs. Btw, if you’re tired of me tweeting about this, good news is I think we’re approaching the finish line.” These developments suggest that a spot Bitcoin ETF is only a question of when, not if. They also show a growing consensus between ETF applicants and the SEC, which only wants to fine-tune all proposals before approving a batch or all 12 applicants (besides Pando Asset) at once. #2 MicroStrategy Will Buy More BTC Another driving force could be MicroStrategy’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin. The company’s latest filing revealed an additional purchase of 16,130 BTC, amounting to roughly $608 million. This acquisition, at an average price of about $36,785 per Bitcoin, takes MicroStrategy’s total holdings to 174,530 BTC. However, what was even more important was the news that MicroStrategy is already planning its next Bitcoin buys. The company has entered into an agreement to offer up to $750 million worth of class A common stock, a move interpreted by many as a preparation for further Bitcoin purchases. This means that Saylor will buy even more BTC in the coming weeks or months, definitely making a positive impact on BTC price. The news is definitely bullish for the price, while some traders might want to front run it. #3 Market Dynamics The current market dynamics surrounding Bitcoin’s price surge have been closely scrutinized by leading crypto analysts, revealing nuanced insights into the behavior of market participants. Crypto analyst Skew highlighted a specific pattern in the buying behavior, indicating a strategic approach by market players. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETF In January 2024: A New Player Just Joined The Game He stated “Fairly obvious taker twap bidding on the corn here. Open Interest & Delta: Looking like both longs & shorts are chasing this move.” This comment suggests that both bullish and bearish traders are actively participating, leading to heightened market volatility and price movement. Additionally, Skew pointed out specific activity on the Binance spot market: “Still persistent spot supply around mid $38K area. Bid driven by spot takers & limit asks were filled. If takers can sustain bid momentum & clear that supply then could be looking for limit chasing on the bid for higher prices.” Byzantine General, another crypto analyst, found another major driver for the recent price action. He stated, “Spot markets are still trading at a premium, not just Coinbase. And the fact that USD markets are consistently trading a lot higher than USDT markets makes me think that perhaps new money is flowing in.” #4 Breakout Move On Lower Time Frames From a technical standpoint, crypto pundit Scott Melker observed a breakout move on the lower time frames. He noted, “Bitcoin breaking out on low time frame. “ In the 15-minute chart, Bitcoin has been trading within a descending channel, a pattern marked by sequential lower highs and lower lows. This typically reflects a bearish trend. However, a few hours ago, the Bitcoin price has managed to break above the upper boundary of this channel, a movement that is often interpreted as a potential reversal signal. The low time frame breakout is significant for traders because it indicates a shift in short-term sentiment, possibly setting the stage for a continued upward trajectory in the higher time frames. At press time, BTC traded at $38,350.

Data by Glassnode shows just over 37,000 BTC, worth $1.4 billion, has been withdrawn from exchanges since Nov. 17 in a sign of investors taking direct custody of their coins.  The outflow likely represents a bias for a long-term holding strategy, although some of it could have stemmed from Binance's guilty plea. The bias for holding means strong demand and weakening sell-side pressure in the market amid euphoria from an expected launch of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S.  Exchange outflows have historically marked local price lows, supporting expectations of a medium-term price rise.  BTC traded above the $38,800 mark early Friday, leading to gains in the broader crypto market, with some major tokens jumping as much as 5% in the past 24 hours.  Overall market capitalization rose to $1.5 trillion – a level last seen in May 2022 – adding some $400 billion since the start of October.  Some market watchers say expected rate interest cuts by central banks in the months ahead could generally attract capital to markets – leading to more volatility in speculative markets such as cryptocurrencies.  ""The Federal Reserve has paused its rate hiking cycle and central banks around the world are following,"" Anthony Rousseau, head of brokerage at TradeStation, told CoinDesk in an email. ""It's plausible to believe we have reached the heights of this tightening cycle. For risk assets to get a sustained bid we will need to see a path forward with lower rates and an end to Quantitative Tightening.""  ""We are potentially entering in 2024 an opportunity for a net positive liquidity for the markets. Bitcoin is a pure reflection of net liquidity in the markets, and we would need to see positive liquidity to support any substantial bullish activity,"" Rousseau added.  Bitcoin momentum started to rise late Tuesday as Federal Reserve governor Chris Waller said recent data suggested a slowdown in the economy and continuing moderation in inflation showed current policies were in the ""right spot.""  Waller also said that if inflation were to continue to decline, there's a good argument to be made for rate cuts within a few months.  Interest rate decisions tend to move markets. Higher rates usually mean risk assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies take a hit as investors could take profits and invest in bonds.  We may earn a commission from partner links.

With a C-Corp structure, a portion of the overall tax burden on income and gains is paid by the fund issuer and a portion is paid by the end investor outside of the fund. In an RIC structure, the entire tax burden on income and gains is paid by the end investor. If you’re a tax-sensitive investor looking for long-term exposure to Ethereum and Bitcoin futures, a fund structured as a C-Corp may result in higher after-tax returns. Understand the Basics: C-Corp vs. RIC Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) are known not only for the dramatic price appreciation over their short history, but also for their volatility and wide price swings. Given these dynamics, investors need to pay particular attention to the tax implications. We believe comparing after-tax returns is crucial, as investors consider the Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs now available in the market. On an after-tax basis, a fund structured as a C-Corp may result in higher after-tax returns than funds structured as regulated investment companies (RICs). This is especially true for high-net-worth individuals and corporations investing over longer time horizons and through periods of high volatility. Tax-exempt investors or individuals investing through tax-deferred accounts are less likely to reap the benefits of a C-Corp structure. With a C-Corp structure, a portion of the overall tax burden on income and gains is paid by the fund issuer and a portion is paid by the end investor outside of the fund. In an RIC structure, the entire tax burden on income and gains is paid by the end investor. Because of the relative corporate vs. individual tax rates and the tax loss carry-forward and carry-back provisions, the overall tax burden paid inside and outside of the C-Corp may be less than the overall tax burden paid outside the fund by the investor in an RIC structure. Additionally, for a longer-term investor, there is an opportunity to control the recognition of gains and potentially defer the payment of taxes with an investment in a C-Corp because the C-Corp is not required to distribute all of its gains each calendar year, while an RIC is required to do so in order to maintain its RIC status. Think of C-Corp like Gardening in a Greenhouse To help you understand the difference between investing in a C-Corp vs. an RIC, let’s think about gardening in a greenhouse vs. planting directly outside. Both gardens (portfolios) will result in a harvest (returns), but the size and nature of the harvest may differ. Investing in a C-Corp is akin to cultivating a garden within a greenhouse. Within this controlled environment, plants are shielded from unpredictable weather (i.e., tax implications) with the aid of the greenhouse's climate control. On extremely hot or cold days, the temperature inside can be adjusted to protect the plants. Similarly, a C-Corp possesses the capability to carry forward and back capital losses, enabling it to offset potential gains. This greenhouse allows gardeners to harvest a portion of their crops (distributions) at the end of each season and harvest the rest when they are ripe. Likewise, with a C-Corp, investors can keep more of their money invested in the fund, as C-Corps are not required to distribute long-term capital gains to investors. C-Corp distributions are taxed at more favorable qualified dividend Income (QDI) rates, while RIC distributions are taxed at an investor’s ordinary income tax rate. A garden planted directly outside without a greenhouse is like an RIC. While they might get sunlight directly and can still have fruitful crops, they are more exposed to the elements. They don’t have the flexibility of temperature control, and crops from the outdoor garden might need to be picked on a set schedule at the end of each season, which may not be the preference of all gardeners - or investors. However, a garden planted outside may have lower maintenance compared to a greenhouse garden, reflecting how an RIC can avoid paying taxes at the fund level whereas a C-Corp is required to pay taxes at the fund level. Don’t Let Short-Term NAV Underperformance Concern You C-Corps account for corporate taxes by accruing them on income and gains earned throughout the year. This tax accrual is reflected in the daily calculation of a fund’s Net Asset Value ((NAV)). In contrast, an RIC does not accrue taxes in its daily NAV. Consequently, in periods of rising markets, the NAV performance of a fund structured as a C-Corp may trail that of an RIC. The taxes accrued inside the fund for the C-Corp structure will generally reduce the tax burden that investors pay outside the fund. Therefore, investors in the RIC structure will generally owe more taxes at the investor level than investors in the C-Corp. For long-term, taxable investors in a C-Corp, the benefits of favorable tax treatment on distributions, coupled with the ability for loss carry-forwards and carry-backs, can result in increased tax efficiency and higher after-tax returns. In short, while C-Corps may appear to lag behind RICs during rising markets due to the fund’s daily tax accrual, the long-term tax efficiency can offer better after-tax returns over time. Benefits of a C-Corp Structure Potential for Better After-Tax Returns : For long-term, taxable investors, a C-Corp structure can potentially yield better after-tax returns compared to RICs. Flexible Handling of Losses : C-Corps can carry forward and carry back capital losses to offset gains and are not required to distribute long-term capital gains to investors, which may help investors reduce tax liability while keeping more money continually invested in the fund. Tax-Friendly Distributions : While distributions from RICs in this asset class aretaxed at an individual’s ordinary income rate, C-Corp distributions are considered QDI and are taxed at long-term capital gains rates, which are currently lower than ordinary income tax rates. Additionally, for corporate investors, the distributions are eligible for the Dividends Received Deduction ((DRD)), which results in 50% of the dividends from the C-Corp being excluded from the taxable income of the corporate investor. Treatment of NAV : While in a rising market a C-Corp may appear to have lower returns because of the daily tax accrual, the long-term benefits of distributions that are taxed as QDI and DRD and the ability of the C-Corp to utilize losses from one period to offset gains from another will generally result in higher after-tax returns for long-term investors. Simple Tax Reporting : No need to worry about complex tax documents. Both C-Corps and RICs report income to investors using Form 1099. When considering Bitcoin or Ethereum futures as an investment, it's essential to understand the tax implications. VanEck’s C-Corp structured funds, VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF ( EFUT ) and VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( XBTF ), offer a unique approach that could be beneficial for many long-term, tax-sensitive investors.

The value of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) and the Funds’ Futures holdings, could decline rapidly, including to zero. You should be prepared to lose your entire investment. The Funds do not invest in BTC, ETH or other digital assets directly. The further development and acceptance of digital asset networks, which is part of a new and rapidly changing industry, is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate, the slowing, stopping or reversing of the development or acceptance of the digital asset networks may adversely affect the price of digital assets and therefore cause the Funds to suffer losses, regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in digital assets or restrict the use of digital assets or the operations of the digital asset networks or venues on which digital assets trade in a manner that adversely affects the price of digital assets and, therefore, the Funds’ digital asset Futures. Digital assets generally operate without central authority (such as a bank) and are not backed by any government, digital assets are not legal tender and federal, state and/or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of digital assets, and regulation in the United States is still developing. Futures Contract Risk. The use of futures contracts involves risks that are in addition to, and potentially greater than, the risks of investing directly in securities and other more traditional assets. The market for digital asset Futures may be less developed, and potentially less liquid and more volatile, than more established futures markets. Digital asset Futures are subject to collateral requirements and daily limits that may limit the Fund’s ability to achieve its target exposure. Margin requirements for digital asset Futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”) may be substantially higher than margin requirements for many other types of futures contracts. Futures contracts exhibit “futures basis,” which refers to the difference between the current market value of the underlying digital asset (the “spot” price) and the price of the cash-settled futures contracts. This risk may be adversely affected by “negative roll yields” in “contango” markets. The Funds will “roll” out of one futures contract as the expiration date approaches and into another futures contract on a digital asset with a later expiration date. The “rolling” feature creates the potential for a significant negative effect on the Fund’s performance that is independent of the performance of the spot prices of the digital asset. A market where futures prices are generally greater than spot prices is referred to as a “contango” market. Therefore, if the futures market for a given commodity is in contango, then the value of a futures contract on that commodity would tend to decline over time (assuming the spot price remains unchanged), because the higher futures price would fall as it converges to the lower spot price by expiration. Extended period of contango may cause significant and sustained losses. An investment in the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF ((EFUT)) may be subject to risks which include, but are not limited to, risks related to market and volatility, investment (in ETH futures), ETH and ETH futures, futures contract, derivatives, counterparty, investment capacity, target exposure and rebalancing, borrowing and leverage, credit, interest rate, liquidity, investing in other investment companies, management, new fund, non-diversified, operational, portfolio turnover, regulatory, repurchase agreements, tax, cash transactions, authorized participant concentration, no guarantee of active trading market, trading issues, fund shares trading, premium/discount risk and liquidity of fund shares, U.S. government securities, debt securities, municipal securities, money market funds, securitized/mortgage- backed securities, sovereign bond, ETH-related company, ETH-related concentration, and equity securities risks, all of which could significantly and adversely affect the value of an investment in the Fund. An investment in the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF ((XBTF)) may be subject to risks which include, among others market and volatility, investment, futures contract, derivatives, investments related to bitcoin and bitcoin futures, derivatives, counterparty, investment capacity, target exposure and rebalancing, borrowing and leverage, indirect investment, credit, interest rate, illiquidity, investing in other investment companies, management, new fund, non-diversified, operational, portfolio turnover, regulatory, repurchase agreements, tax, of cash transactions, authorized participant concentration, no guarantee of active trading market, trading issues, fund shares trading, premium/discount and liquidity of fund shares, U.S. government securities, debt securities, municipal securities, money market funds, securitized/ asset-backed securities, and sovereign bond risks, all of which could significantly and adversely affect the value of an investment in the Fund. The Funds are classified for federal income tax purposes as taxable regular corporations or Subchapter “C” corporations. As “C” corporations, the Funds accrue a current and deferred tax expense. The deferred tax expense represents the future tax liability associated with the capital appreciation of its investments. The Funds’ accrued current and deferred tax liabilities, if any, will be reflected in their net assets value per share. An estimate of current and deferred income tax expenses/(benefit) is dependent upon the Funds’ net investment income/(loss) and realized and unrealized gains/(losses) on investments, and such expenses/(benefits) may vary greatly from year to year and from day to day depending on the performance of the Funds’ investments and general market conditions. Therefore, any estimate of current and deferred income tax expenses/(benefit) cannot be reliably predicted from year to year. Future actual income tax expense (if any) will be incurred over many years depending on if and when investment gains are realized, the then-current tax basis of assets and federal income tax rates, the level of net loss carryforwards and other factors. As such, current and deferred income taxes are not included in the total expense ratio, and the Funds’ actual total expense ratios may differ significantly. VanEck Absolute Return Advisers Corporation is registered with the CFTC as both commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor, and is a member of the National Futures Association. The Funds are speculative in nature and involve a high degree of risk. An investor may lose all or substantially all of an investment in the Funds. Commodity futures generally are volatile and the Funds may not be suitable for all investors. Investing involves substantial risk and high volatility, including possible loss of principal.
