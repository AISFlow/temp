Indeed, 43% of respondents took the view that bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the world’s largest crypto by market cap, has the most superior upside potential. “This has come primarily at the expense of Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) which was in the lead at the prior survey taken in April,” the report said. CoinShares’s quarterly survey drew responses from investors who cover $750B of assets under management. Note that the survey may not accurately reflect U.S. sentiment, with 70% of respondents coming from Europe and the Middle East, 25% from North America and around 5% from Asia. The most popular reason (37% of respondents) for investing in digital assets continued to be the prospect for growth in distributed ledger technology, followed by diversification, speculation, good value and client demand. In the eyes of respondents, there remains one key risk: regulation and the potential for a government ban. The nascent crypto space has come under a regulatory clampdown that has raised concerns about growth prospects. However, some have argued that regulatory clarity would bode well for crypto as it would remove the so-called bad actors from the space. Nevertheless, asset managers’ weighting of digital assets in their portfolios shrank to 0.7% by the end of June from 1.8% in April. On top of that, more than $400M of outflows were recorded during the first half of 2023, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ramped up its effort to scrutinize the emerging industry. The sentiment has started to shift, though. Some $470M flowed back into the market for the three weeks prior to July 14, after BlackRock ( BLK ) filed an application for an exchange-traded fund that would invest directly into bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), spurring a raft of fellow asset managers to rush to be the first to market a U.S. spot BTC ETF. The ETF race pushed up the price of bitcoin to as high as $31.4K from roughly $25K in mid-June. The token stood at $29.8K as of Friday afternoon, up 79% year-to-date. In a separate report, CoinShares said digital asset investment products logged inflows for the week ended July 14, marking the fourth straight week of inflows, as investors cheered a U.S. judge's ruling that Ripple Labs' crypto asset XRP ( XRP-USD ) can be considered a commodity in some cases. In addition to regulation, custody and accessibility have both been cited as reasons why institutional investors don’t want to allocate funds to digital assets, “suggesting some investors aren’t comfortable with the existing methods to invest,” CoinShares said. SA analyst Florian Grummes, using an approach based on technical analysis, reckons the most likely direction for bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is higher, in the wake of the recent excitement surrounding a potential spot BTC ETF. Still, he warned to remain skeptical given ""the macroeconomic outlook as well as the typical summer lethargy.""

Previewing the price chart shows that the coin has been in range over the years, capturing all of its volatility. Despite occasional dumps and pumps, the structure is yet to be broken. By the time the screenshot was shared on July 21, Bitcoin was trading in the lower part of the rising channel, skirting the support trend line, an indicator that prices have been generally lower in recent months. The rejection of lower lows and bounce from the support trend line, the analyst says, is bullish and squarely puts back bulls in contention. Bitcoin To $175,000? According to the trader’s assessment, a breakout above the upper resistance level at around $32,000 could potentially trigger a new bull run that may see the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency retest highs of the rising channel at $175,000, a level that upbeat HODLers can mark as a feasible target. Related Reading: Maker (MKR) Surges 26% In A Week As Token Buyback Program Goes Live Still, considering the volatility in crypto, this bullish forecast cannot be dismissed. To illustrate, the last bull run drove Bitcoin prices from sub-$10,000 to peaks of $69,000 in less than two years. Therefore, if Bitcoin bulls push above $32,000, a price level that the analyst claim is important, it could be a bullish signal that may be the beginning of another leg up in the resumption of the bullish formation set in motion between 2020 and 2021. Bitcoin is trading below the $30,000 level at spot rates with resistance at $31,800. Despite the general optimism across the board, bulls are yet to breach July 2023 highs as prices consolidate. Halving And ETF Approval As Tailwinds? Specific triggers for the next run are unknown for now. Even so, considering past cycles, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event may provide the impetus for a leg up toward 2021 highs at $69,000. Besides, traders are closely monitoring how the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the United States progresses. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected several spot Bitcoin ETF applications in the past. However, the involvement of BlackRock has been received positively, lifting prices in the past few weeks. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, managing trillions.

This growth in the NFT sector has sparked considerable interest and speculation among investors, prompting many to ponder the potential impact it may have on the price of MATIC, the native cryptocurrency of the Polygon network. However, despite the impressive surge in NFT sales volume and seller participation, a closer examination reveals that not everything works in Polygon’s favor. While the NFT market on the platform may be flourishing, other factors could impact the overall sentiment and performance of MATIC. Polygon NFT sales are trending up. Polygon NFT summer? pic.twitter.com/9Jh2ENkyjj — Narb (@NarbTrading) July 20, 2023 MATIC Price Movement In Response To Metric Movement The recent MATIC price report indicates a remarkable surge in Polygon NFT sellers, recording a staggering increase of over 480% within the last 30 days. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Positive Price Movement, Bulls Set Crosshair At $0.075 Meanwhile, MATIC’s current price stands at $0.772874 according to Coingecko, experiencing a 1.6% rally in the last 24 hours but also facing a 4.3% decline. Several factors could explain this lackluster price performance. Source: Cryptoslam For one, market sentiment plays a crucial role in shaping cryptocurrency prices, and during this period, overall opinion towards cryptocurrencies, including MATIC, might not have been favorable. Source: Coingecko Regulatory uncertainties, macroeconomic events, and broader market trends could have overshadowed the positive impact of the NFT growth on Polygon. However, price movements in the cryptocurrency market may only sometimes reflect immediate developments. There could be a time lag between the surge in NFT volume and its direct impact on MATIC’s price. Market reactions can be delayed, and sustained growth in NFT activity may be required to affect the token’s value significantly. Rising Competition Poses Challenge For Polygon A recent report also highlights the increasing competition that Polygon, a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is facing within its market niche. Polygon has been known for its ability to enhance Ethereum’s performance, making it faster, cheaper, and more efficient. MATIC market cap currently at $7.11 billion. Chart: TradingView.com However, the emergence of numerous other cryptocurrencies offering similar services, including Optimism, poses a significant challenge to Polygon’s once-dominant position in the sector. In the past, Polygon enjoyed a clear lead in the Layer-2 scaling niche, capturing investor attention and interest. However, the current market dynamics indicate that this advantage has diminished. Related Reading: Chainlink Holds Strong With 19% Rally – More Gains In The Pipeline? Despite its impressive features, the price of Polygon has exhibited minimal movement throughout the year, indicating subdued investor sentiment and potentially reduced demand. On the other hand, Optimism, a direct competitor to Polygon, has experienced remarkable growth over the year, with its yearly growth soaring by over 80%.

Conic Finance is a liquidity pool balancing platform for the decentralized finance protocol Curve. Details Of The Hack According to security firm BlockSec, the attack’s root cause was price manipulation caused by “read-only reentrancy.” Reentrancy is a common bug that allows attackers to exploit smart contracts by tricking them into making repeated calls to the targeted protocol and stealing its assets. A call is an authorization for a smart contract to interact with a user’s wallet address. Web3 risk-alert source Beosin stated that a single transaction sent nearly the stolen amount to a new Ethereum address. Conic Finance reached out to users, tweeting they were investigating the exploit and would share updates soon. “We are currently investigating an exploit involving the ETH Omnipool and will share updates as soon as they are available.” Security firm PeckShield also analyzed the attack, revealing the root cause to be originating from the protocol’s new CurveLPOracleV2 contract. The firm tweeted, “Hi, @ConicFinance. Based on the initial analysis from the malicious tx, our initial analysis shows the root cause comes from the new CurveLPOracleV2 contract. FWIW, our audit identifies a similar read-only reentrancy issue. However, the same issue is introduced in the newly introduced CurveLPOracleV2 contract, which was not part of the audit scope.” Curve has also been following up with Conic Finance, stating that the primary issue had been identified and only the ETH Omnipool was impacted. “If you have funds on @ConicFinance please remove! There seem to be an attack, which though doesn't drain all in one go” Conic later tweeted a detailed version of events, stating that they were alerted of an exploit impacting the $crvUSD Omnipool, adding they had taken all possible safety measures to limit the attack. “Roughly four hours ago, we were alerted of an exploit affecting the $crvUSD Omnipool. In response to this and given today’s ETH exploit, we immediately enforced maximum safety measures and temporarily shut down all Omnipools.” DeFi Hacks A Major Problem The decentralized finance ecosystem has been plagued by a series of high-profile hacks impacting several major projects. A report by Web3 portfolio application De.Fi highlighted the scale of the problem. The reports stated that DeFi hacks and scams resulted in attackers stealing over $200 million in the second quarter of 2023 alone. However, losses to DeFi hacks were smaller in Q2 when compared to Q1 of 2023, with CertiK reporting that protocols lost over $320 million between January and March. Conic Finance had only recently gone live, allowing users to deposit tokens into their Omnipools. Omnipools allowed users to diversify their exposure across the Curve ecosystem and also increased rewards. After going live, Conic Finance was able to attract millions of dollars in capital, highlighting the huge demand for such a product.

15178119,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543826,1690028445,Maker (MKR) Surges 26% In A Week As Token Buyback Program Goes Live,"In the past week, Maker (MKR) token has captured significant attention in the crypto market, surging an impressive 26%. This remarkable price action coincides with the introduction of a groundbreaking token buyback program by the leading decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, MakerDAO. As the DeFi ecosystem continues to expand, Maker (MKR) stands out as one of the largest and oldest DeFi lending protocols, gaining popularity for its issuance of the widely used DAI stablecoin with a market value of $4.6 billion. MKR Token Buyback Program Triggers Surge The recent surge in Maker (MKR), the governance token of the $5.3 billion decentralized finance (DeFi) lender MakerDAO, can be attributed to the implementation of a token buyback program. The token buyback scheme, named the Smart Burn Engine, is designed to remove MKR tokens from the market. The mechanism involves allocating excess DAI stablecoins from Maker’s surplus buffer to purchase MKR tokens from a UniSwap pool. The governance proposal behind this initiative aims to strengthen the token’s value and governance while actively engaging MKR holders in voting on crucial proposals. Related Reading: Dogecoin Becomes 8th-Largest Cryptocurrency After Adding $1 Billion To Market Cap According to blockchain data, the lending platform is poised to remove approximately $7 million worth of MKR governance tokens from the market over the next month through this buyback initiative. With the token’s total market capitalization standing at around $1 billion, the buyback represents a 0.7% reduction in the token’s supply per month, potentially enhancing MKR’s scarcity and value proposition. This strategic move is likely to attract further interest and investment from the crypto community. The token buyback program has already shown promising results, with MakerDAO purchasing approximately $230,000 worth of MKR tokens within the last 24 hours. This early success indicates positive momentum and investor interest in the buyback initiative. Maker: Significant Developments In 2023 In addition to the token buyback program, MakerDAO has been proactively diversifying its revenue streams by investing its DAI reserve assets into traditional financial products, such as bank loans and government bonds. This strategic decision has proven to be fruitful, as it enables the platform to generate sustainable revenue from yields, providing a solid basis for potential growth and long-term value. Unlike meme coins lacking tangible business prospects, Maker’s diversified revenue streams instill confidence in investors and the broader DeFi community, making it an attractive investment option. Related Reading: Bitfinex Hackers Surrender: Couple Agrees to Forfeit 120,000 Bitcoin in Plea Deal Beyond the token buyback and DAI reserve investments, MakerDAO is also undergoing a significant overhaul that includes upgrades for both the DAI and MKR tokens. Furthermore, the platform is transitioning into smaller autonomous organizations known as SubDAOs, which have the potential to issue their own tokens. These developments signal a dynamic future for MakerDAO and highlight the platform’s commitment to continuous innovation and progress. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a 9.98% decrease in the price. However, in the last hour alone, the price has shown a modest increase of 0.28%. As of now, the current price of MKR stands at $1,094.53. It’s important to note that Maker is currently 82.73% below its all-time high, which was recorded at $6,339.02.

15177014,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543807,1690025623,Ethereum (ETH) Records Highest CEX Inflows In 2 Months,"Over the past week, Ethereum (ETH) registered the highest inflows into centralized exchanges (CEX) in the past two months. These significant asset movements have suggested a potential price dip for ETH. CoinGecko data shows that the second-largest cryptocurrency has been experiencing a slight price decline, losing 2.5% of its value in the past week. As of this writing, the Ether token changes hand at $1,892.65, with a negligible 0.2% gain in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: XDC Network Dominates Weekend Top 100 Roster With 50% Rally Ethereum Registers $383 Million Worth Of ETH In CEX Inflows According to data from IntoTheBlock, Ethereum witnessed the largest inflows into centralized exchanges in the past two months. The data analytics platform found that at least $383 million worth of ETH was deposited into these exchanges. IntoTheBlock also revealed that a significant percentage of the CEX inflows came from a single address and in a single transaction. This deposit came from an old wallet that accumulated 61,216 ETH during the Ethereum Initial Coin Offering (ICO). This pre-mine wallet had been dormant for eight years, with its constituent ETH worth more than $116 million untouched. On Wednesday, July 19, this address became activated, and its stash of Ether tokens was abruptly moved to another address associated with the Kraken exchange. Data from Whale Alert shows that a significant amount of Ether tokens has been transferred to crypto exchanges by several whales over the past week. Notably, more than 200,000 Ether tokens have been transferred to Coinbase in separate transactions within this period. Indeed, the movement of massive amounts of ETH to centralized exchanges can signal impending selling pressure, which can drive the asset’s price down. However, not all large transfers to an exchange precipitate a downward price movement, as the whales might not intend to sell immediately or all at once. Total ETH Staked Reaches All-Time High The Ethereum network has been experiencing a steady increase in the total amount of ETH staked on the blockchain. According to data from IntoTheBlock, this figure has reached $52.3 billion, representing its highest value ever. The data analytics company also noted that with an increasing amount of staked ETH, the Ethereum blockchain is bound to become even more secure, as there will be a corresponding decrease in the risk of the network being taken over by a single entity. Related Reading: Dogecoin Becomes 8th-Largest Cryptocurrency After Adding $1 Billion To Market Cap It is worth noting that this surge in staking activity can be linked to the successful launch of the Shapella upgrade. The Shapella upgrade offered a new dimension to ETH staking, as investors can now lock and unlock their assets at will. This increased flexibility eliminated a substantial portion of risk that has been attributed to ETH staking in the past.

15176603,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543808,1690024511,How Did Shiba Inu Price React To 3 Trillion SHIB Investor Accumulation?,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) has emerged as a force to be reckoned with in the digital asset landscape despite the lack of significant bullish momentum in the past few weeks. However, recent events have catapulted this canine-inspired cryptocurrency into the spotlight, as an astonishing 3 trillion SHIB tokens were accumulated by investors. Cryptocurrencies are renowned for their inherent volatility, and Shiba Inu is no exception. The token’s meteoric popularity and the passionate community backing it have contributed to its roller-coaster journey on the market. But with the recent accumulation of such an astronomical number of SHIB tokens, questions arise about how this development will reverberate throughout the ecosystem and influence its market value. SHIB Token Accumulation And Price Stability A recent SHIB price report highlights a notable surge in SHIB token accumulation by investors, indicating heightened interest and confidence in the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: XDC Network Dominates Weekend Top 100 Roster With 50% Rally With approximately 3 trillion SHIB tokens, amounting to a significant value of over $23 million being bought from exchanges within a two-day period, it appears that investors are actively seeking to bolster their positions in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Within two days, exchanges sold 3 trillion SHIB coins worth $23 million. Source: Santiment Despite the substantial increase in token accumulation, the Shiba Inu price has not witnessed any significant change, leaving investors somewhat disconcerted. A lack of price movement often results in a scenario where investors adopt a “wait-and-see” approach, keeping their holdings static rather than engaging in active trades. This phenomenon, commonly known as “sitting ducks,” can hinder the overall liquidity and dynamism of the SHIB market. SHIB feeling the pain on the weekly timeframe. Source: Coingecko Based on the latest data from crypto market tracker Coingecko, the current price of SHIB stands at $0.00000785. Over the past 24 hours, the token has experienced a modest 1.2% rally, which indicates some level of short-term market activity. However, over the last seven days, SHIB has faced a decline of 5.8%, hinting at potential challenges in sustaining positive price momentum. Shibarium’s Potential Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is gearing up to introduce an innovative layer-2 solution known as Shibarium, aiming to revolutionize the process of purchasing SHIB tokens by enhancing cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and speed. Shiba Inu market cap currently at $4.5 billion on the weekend chart: TradingView.com This highly anticipated L2 network has garnered immense excitement within the Shiba Inu community, with investors hailing it as the potential catalyst for propelling SHIB’s price to unprecedented heights, even setting the ambitious target of reaching $0.01. Related Reading: Chainlink Holds Strong With 19% Rally – More Gains In The Pipeline? The impending launch of Shibarium has ignited a surge of optimism among SHIB enthusiasts, as it promises to address the inherent limitations of the current token acquisition process.
