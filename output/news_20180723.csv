The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced the guilty plea on Monday, coming days after it was reported that Montroll was close to a deal with prosecutors. Jon Montroll was arrested back in February by U.S. authorities, as CoinDesk reported at the time, in connection with securities investment platform BitFunder and crypto exchange site WeExchange.  Montroll was accused of running an unregistered securities exchange, as well as providing info to investigators that was described as ""misleading."" Montroll also allegedly ""converted a portion of WeExchange users' bitcoins to his personal use without the users' knowledge or consent,"" according to a statement published Monday.  He notably was accused of lying about the number of bitcoins available to BitFunder and WeExchange users after the latter was hacked, as well as committing perjury while testifying to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  WeExchange lost around 6,000 bitcoins at the time of the hack, which left the platform insolvent, as previously reported.  Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a statement Monday:  ""As he admitted today, Jon Montroll deceived his investors and then attempted to deceive the SEC. He repeatedly lied during sworn testimony and misled SEC staff to avoid taking responsibility for the loss of thousands of his customers' bitcoins.""  Though the case was originally brought by the SEC, the FBI and Southern District of New York Attorney's office prosecuted Montroll under criminal charges.

The influential business lobbying group launched its FinTech Innovation Initiative last Wednesday, highlighting development in cryptocurrencies and token sales as one of its eight ""FinTech principles"" aimed at ""bridging the gap between technology and [Washington] D.C.""  The organization specifically called for increased guidance on token sales, including how to determine whether a token is a security ""so companies can have more predictability and certainty in the marketplace.""  According to the document, the initiative wants to ""promote new and innovative ways to access capital, such as initial coin offerings (ICOs), while advocating for tailored oversight and strong consumer and investor protections. Entrepreneurs know all too well how difficult it is to raise the capital necessary to start or grow their business.""  The Chamber continued:  ""We urge the SEC to continue studying ICOs to see how they can be an effective tool for raising capital, while protecting investors and ensuring applicable laws are met. We also urge the CFTC to study how cryptocurrency is functioning in the futures and commodities market. In both cases, we urge the agencies to regulate the products and services enabled by the technology instead of the technology itself.""  In its message, the group urged both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to write ""expedited no-action letters,"" meaning letters that ask startups to cease unlawful activity yet recommend no legal action against these firms.  The Chamber further wrote that ""we urge the SEC to expand the definition of accredited investor to include those with experience or educational backgrounds that demonstrate subject matter expertise to broaden smaller-dollar, main street investments.""  Doing so, the organization wrote, ""would alleviate contradictory and overlapping rules, and allow institutions to focus on what really matters – reducing consumer risk and preventing fraud.""  Time is of the essence as well, given that there is ""generally a significant lag time between the speed of technological innovation and regulatory action."" As such, the initiative states that it is ""critical"" that the SEC and CFTC provide clarity, ""so regulatory hurdles do not become a barrier to entry.""  ""We look forward to working with both of these agencies as the use of tokens grows and regulatory expectations are clarified,"" the Chamber concluded.

42401697,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd26KN,1532372423,Crypto Really (Really) Wants a Bitcoin ETF,"The crypto universe has spoken: they want a bitcoin ETF and they want it now.  As CoinDesk previously reported, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sought comments earlier this summer on the latest effort to get an exchange-traded fund tied to bitcoin approved and listed.  That comments period is now closed, and the SEC is ostensibly going over the input it received – but what the agency ultimately decides is anyone's guess.  Dubbed the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust, the proposed ETF would be priced from a bundle of crypto-assets that fluctuates in value primarily in accordance with over-the-counter trading desks, as opposed to online cryptocurrency exchanges.  In addition, SolidX would offer insurance for investors covering loss or theft of bitcoins held by the trust, differentiating it from the most recent bid for a regulated crypto ETF led by the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust.  As a result of the SEC's request – and the intense interest in such a topic as demonstrated in the past – economists, CEOs, CIOs, consultants, financial analysts, and more have sent in their comments, all published indiscriminately in a series of posts ranging from the thoughtful to the blatantly comical.  As one Twitter user boasts:  Not all comments were supportive, however, with some seeing the potential approval of a bitcoin ETF regardless of the issuing company as a dangerous precedent and perhaps possibly ""the biggest mistake since the creation of synthetic-CDOs.""  Others told the agency:  Nevertheless, the majority of positive comments overwhelmingly drowned out the concern.  Supporters of the proposed rule change argued that a bitcoin ETF would, in fact, make the crypto markets a safer and more trustworthy space for investors to deal in.  And of course, as with any public forum, still others seemed to miss the point of the issue entirely and thought it appropriate to voice concerns for other more pressing matters in their purview.  While the SEC likely expected the onslaught of several different opinions to answer their open call for ""written data, views, and arguments,"" they may not have been prepared for the fervour at which the crypto community would capitalize on this opportunity to explain to government officials just how badly they want that bitcoin ETF approved.  (That said, it's not the first time the SEC has been on the receiving end of overly enthusiastic bitcoin supporters.)  The SEC has up to 90 days to take all of these comments – the good and the bad, the wild and the silly – before coming to a decision. As with last year's drama, only time will tell which decision the agency will make.  Editor's Note: Some comments captured in this post have been shortened.

42401686,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd26BW,1532370016,Wanchain's Bridge to the Ethereum Blockchain Is Now Open,"Amber Baldet, former JPMorgan blockchain program lead (and current CEO of Clovyr), has expressed her doubts about the proliferation of blockchain protocols: ""Each of these blockchains speaks a different language,"" she said in April.  Getting different blockchains to talk to one another has become a pressing issue, as more and more protocols pop up – eos, tezos, neo, cardano, not to mention the two incumbent giants, bitcoin and ethereum.  The growing interoperability problem may be meeting its match, however.  On Monday, the Beijing- and Austin-based startup Wanchain announced the live release of its protocol's version 2.0, which allows for decentralized transactions between its blockchain and ethereum using a form of atomic swap.  With this announcement, wanchain has become one of the first protocols to demonstrate the viability of cross-chain transactions. The project has made linking blockchains its core focus, with the aim of enabling use cases like multi-asset ICOs and better decentralized exchanges – the latter of which has been the goal of a growing number of startups.  Wanchain raised 121,500 ether – worth around $37 million at the time – during its ERC-20 token sale in 2017. In January, it executed a token migration from ethereum to its own blockchain.  For now, Wanchain's solution only allows ether (the native currency of the ethereum network) to be transferred to wanchain and back, but in time, according to a statement, wanchain will ""allow for seamless integration with almost any blockchain in existence.""  ""This is a very exciting time for Wanchain in our vision to reshape the world of digital assets and finance,"" the company's founder and CEO Jack Lu said in the statement.  How it works  Teaching blockchain protocols to speak each others' languages is a daunting technical challenge, Lu contends, because ""different blockchains have different consensus algorithms.""  That's only the first challenge, however. Bitcoin represented such a milestone because it was the first decentralized solution to solve the ""double-spend"" problem: in a nutshell, since data is infinitely replicable, what's to stop someone from spending the bitcoin in their account, then spending it again?  Lu told CoinDesk:  ""On a single chain, it's already very challenging to solve the problem of double-spending. And if you're trying to solve the problem of double-spending cross-chain, it's even harder.""  In Wanchain's solution, a group of specialized nodes called ""storemen"" use a technique called secure multiparty computation to lock a certain amount of ether on the ethereum blockchain – preventing it from being spent, but without destroying it (by sending it to an address without a known private key, for example).  That ether then becomes available on wanchain as the ""mapping token,"" WETH. If the user wants to transfer the value back to ethereum, the WETH is burned, and the original ether is unlocked using a threshold scheme, in which a certain number of the storemen nodes must provide fragments of a secret key.  That way, no single node can double-spend the ether while the corresponding WETH still exists.  Wanchain is not alone in this market, though. Nuco's aion project started its work with ethereum as well, releasing a ""testnet"" version of its ether token bridge in June, plus a handful of other projects and startups have been working on creating links between disparate blockchains – for instance, dogecoin and ethereum.  Yet there seems to be interest around collaborative efforts as they relate to this particular use case. Wanchain and Aion, for instance, joined Icon, another project aimed at cross-chain communication, to form the Blockchain Interoperability Alliance in November, in an effort to prevent a confusing array of competing standards.  Public, private and fiat  Yet, wanchain's mission doesn't stop just at interoperability.  The project aspires to be a blockchain for initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well.  With the release of wanchain 2.0, it is now possible to conduct an ICO on Wanchain that accepts both its WAN tokens and ether.  Soon the list of compatible assets will expand to encompass some ERC-20 tokens. Bitcoin compatibility is slated for the end of this year. Each token it can accept in a crowdsale natively improves the use case for a potential buyer, who doesn't have to bother with exchanging what they have.  In fact, Wanchain is incubating six ICO projects now.  Besides fundraising, the company has described potential use cases including decentralized exchanges, the seamless transfer of medical records, and credit and lending services.  Eventually, Lu told CoinDesk in a recent interview, ""we want to connect with not only the public chains, but also private chains, as well as fiat currency.""  Since Wanchain's cross-chain communication is a ""generic solution,"" he said, it would be able to link to central bank-issued crypto assets the same as any other blockchain. He is ""confident"" that blockchain-based fiat currencies will appear in the near future, adding:  ""And then the fiat currency can flow into the crypto economy.""

42401698,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd26IP,1532361648,Decentralized Exchanges Aren't Living Up to Their Name – And Data Proves It,"Some say a ""decentralized exchange"" is an oxymoron. Perhaps not, but for now it's not much more than an aspiration.  Over the past year, dozens of cryptocurrency trading platforms have marketed themselves as decentralized exchanges. While models vary, the term implies they allow users to trade on a peer-to-peer basis, and more importantly, without using a platform operated by a single entity.  The main selling point is that unlike today's better-known crypto trading platforms (think Coinbase, Kraken or Binance), a decentralized exchange shouldn't require traders to store their money with a third party that can be hacked. Yet while ""DEX"" has been a hot buzzword, it's been unclear how decentralized they actually are.  Early indications, however, suggest they're not living up to their name yet.  According to data collected exclusively for CoinDesk from July 2 to July 12 by the ethereum analytics firm Alethio, as well as interviews with market participants, what decentralized exchange models actually offer is a spectrum of technologies with varying degrees of centralization.  Some attempt to decentralize a traditional exchange company, such as the Huobi Chain Project announced in June, while others seek to build a community with stakeholders around a peer-to-peer model, like 0x.  ""Decentralized exchanges are making headway toward the re-elimination of central parties in that [crypto trading] system,"" said Wall Street veteran Jill Carlson.  But they still have quite a ways to go.  For example, Bancor (through its smart contracts) was itself the only market maker on its decentralized platform, where it facilitated roughly 9,691 token swaps between 1,147 traders over the two-week period, Alethio found.  According to Bancor, however, it neither funds nor controls the smart contracts for many tokens on its platform. ""Most conversions on Bancor are processed by smart contracts that are owned and managed by the tokens that list on the Bancor Network, "" Nate Hindman, Bancor's head of communications, told CoinDesk.  Yet the lack of diversity implied by Alethio's data highlights a problem with the ""decentralized liquidity network,"" demonstrated by the steps Bancor took to address a recent $13.5 million hack. Specifically, Bancor's freezing of funds, an action allowed by a mechanism in its code, prompted criticism that the platform was, for all intents and purposes, no different than its centralized predecessors.  ""You're not a 'decentralized exchange' if you're taking away other people's tokens whenever you want,"" tweeted developer Udi Wertheimer.  Decentralized how?  One problem with talking about decentralization in this context is that it can be measured in different ways. An exchange platform might be highly centralized in one dimension but quite decentralized in others.  Take, for example, 0x. During the two weeks tracked by Alethio this open-source protocol that relies on independent relayers for token trading, had 914 market makers facilitating 9,017 trades by 234 traders – already head and shoulders above Bancor in the diversity-of-participants department.  However, those trades are funneled through a much smaller number (17) of ""relayer startups."" Each relayer has its own business model, and the majority of them use their own proprietary software built on top of 0X, rather than purely open-source code that anyone can inspect.  And while 0x isn't responsible for compliance with regulations, its relayers are. So it's hard to call this type of DEX leaderless.  One of those relayers, Paradex, was acquired in May by Coinbase, a company that many in crypto would call the quintessential centralized exchange.  To be fair, though, it could be argued that the 0X ecosystem is arguably more decentralized than other exchanges in the way that counts the most.  ""It's different from a centralized exchange because these relayers are not holding user funds at all. They are completely non-custodial,"" Amir Bandeali, CTO of 0x, told CoinDesk. ""We have seen a lot of relayers starting to make open source market-making tools.""  For Carlson, who works as a consultant to 0x, the term ""decentralized"" should primarily apply to non-custodial trading platforms. As such, she believes hacks such as the Bancor theft point to the dangers of centralized custodians, telling CoinDesk:  ""When we talk about decentralized exchanges, the primary threat that people are concerned about today is custody.""  Early days  Stepping back, it's important to remember that the DEX market is in its infancy, and so the volume is still pretty low.  Indeed, among the DEX platforms analyzed by Alethio, the most popular was IDEX, an exchange developed by the fintech firm Aurora, which facilitated 69,339 swaps between 12,400 traders during the two-week period.  Compared to centralized Bitfinex, which facilitated roughly 92,024 trades in just two days, from July 9 and 10, according to CoinDesk's analysis of its trade history, IDEX's volume is a tiny drop in the niche bucket.  Marshall Swatt, founder of the institutional crypto asset exchange Swatt Exchange, argued that decentralized exchanges are merely ""a fancy form"" of over-the-counter (OTC) trading that won't be able to scale. He told CoinDesk:  ""I just think the lack of fiat on-ramps, the lack of governance, and the lack of compliance, are going to relegate decentralized exchanges to the margins.""  Swatt, who previously co-founded the New York bitcoin exchange Coinsetter then sold it to Kraken in 2016, warned against underestimating the difficulty of managing compliance, security, and customer support, business departments that may not fit bitcoin's grassroots model.  ""You'll never have the level of liquidity because it will never attract the algorithmic traders,"" he said.  Indeed, most DEX models only allow users to swap one cryptocurrency for another, which keeps newcomers to crypto, whether they be institutional investors or first-time buyers, at bay.  Carlson agreed it's hard to imagine decentralized order books, market makers, or know-your-customer identity checks. These are all core pillars of most popular exchanges.  However, in her view, it's an oversimplification to say DEX is merely glorified OTC.  ""The difference here, at least today, lies at the settlement level, not at the execution level,"" Carlson said, speaking to how some DEXs allow P2P settlement without third party oversight or custody. ""What you end up with is an experience that is disintermediated.""  DEX fever  Indeed, none of the shortcomings of current decentralized exchanges have quelled the DEX fervor sweeping the industry.  Speaking to the Paradex acquisition, Scalar Capital co-founder Linda Xie, a Coinbase alum turned hedge fund manager and 0X advisor, told CoinDesk demand for non-custodial P2P platforms could inspire centralized incumbents to offer DEX options as well.  Indeed, Bloomberg reported the long-established exchange Binance wants to ""decentralize"" itself. So does the legacy platform provider Huobi, which announced in June it's offering roughly $166 million to a fund for contributors to the upcoming Huobi Chain Project, which aims to establish a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and eventually incorporate parts of Huobi's exchange.  ""We're not 100 percent sure if a corporation can be 100 percent autonomous,"" Gordon Chen, Huobi Chain Project's executive leader, told Coindesk. ""We're not sure if it can be 100 percent decentralized either. But we believe there can be some kind of balance in between.""  Although granting businesses more sway than users on Huobi's voter-driven exchange HADAX sparked backlash, a few hundred people already applied to build the project's public blockchain.  Along those same lines, Bancor co-founder Eyal Hertzog tweeted that his project is also on a ""pathway to decentralization.""  Alethio's data suggests that so far platforms with more straightforward P2P models have achieved more diversity of participants, even if they have so far gained less traction. For example, during this two-week period in July the startup AirSwap, which operates almost like a Craigslist for ethereum tokens, facilitated 695 swaps between 216 traders with the help of 60 unique market makers.  Such potential is why Xie remains optimistic about the prospect of DEXs, saying: ""This is still just the start.""  Agreeing with Xie's point, Carlson said the wide range of models offer a promising starting point for the further decentralization of trading platforms, concluding:  ""All aspects of the spectrum have an important role to play.""

42401691,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd26ET,1532352610,Pharma Scandal Prompts Calls to Put Vaccine Data on a Blockchain,"A scandal around the fraudulent actions of a vaccine manufacturer in China has sparking a heated debate over the last week – and now the Chinese cryptocurrency community is suggesting blockchain as a potential solution.  The uproar followed a report from China's State Drug Administration, which, based on a tip-off, launched an investigation of the company – Changsheng Biotechnology – and found that it had falsified aspects of its rabies vaccine production data.  The news immediately drew widespread criticism both in the country and internationally, amid fears that some vaccines may not be safe to give to children. The vaccine in question has been reportedly recalled and the firm has been ordered to halt production.  Alongside the public outcry, China's blockchain enthusiasts have been using social media platforms such as 8btc to push for blockchain adoption in the pharma industry, so that every step of a vaccine's production and distribution can be tracked on a tamper-proof ledger.  Notably, one of the best-known of the country's crypto investors, Li Xiaolai, published an article on his own WeChat channel on Monday, arguing that vaccine production and distribution is, in effect, a public affair in China.  As such, he said, the entire vaccine supply chain should be open to all and a distributed ledger should be employed to help record every detail of the process – from who produces the vaccine, who is in charge of quality assurance, which hospitals did a vaccine go to and at what price, who has received shots of the vaccine, and so on.  The openness and transparency of a distributed database would help to ensure the public will remain calm when facing such a situation, Li added.  ""With a traceable chain of data, it's easier to hold people accountable once a vaccine is found with problems. ... And for children who might be harmed by problematic vaccines, it will be also easier for them to claim for damages,"" he said.  While a viable application that can track vaccine production may not be immediately available, Li continued, he believes one will arrive sooner than expected – and preferably on a token-free blockchain.  ""In fact, the token-less blockchain technology has got pretty good prototypes so far. But given people's misunderstanding of blockchain as something just for speculation, ... it's hard to put those applications into usage whether for government agencies or non-profit organizations,"" said Li.  Bypassing censorship  If not so far for pharma supply chain tracking, blockchain has at least been used once again as a means to bypass China's ""Great Firewall"" and permanently store censored articles.  On Saturday, an investigative article – called ""The Vaccine King"" and published on WeChat – listed the wrongdoings of Changsheng Biotechnology over the decades. Within a day of publication, the piece was blocked across social media and the internet in China due to sensitive information it included that the authorities believed had the potential to cause panic.  To counter the censorship, coders to have now hashed the entire article into a transaction on the ethereum blockchain, so that the original text is still available to readers in China.  Although currently opening that ethereum address on WeChat is also censored, access through blockchain exploring websites such as etherscan.io is still available.  The vaccine exposé marks the latest case in which controversial information that was blocked in China has been permanently recorded on the public blockchain to fight internet censorship.  Previously, an article detailing a Chinese version of the #metoo movement was also widely blocked in China, but was later encoded to the ethereum blockchain as a permanent, visible record.

42401657,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd23QK,1532347369,Chinese Region to Shut Down 'Illegal' Bitcoin Miners By September,"China's Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region is set to eliminate ""illegal"" bitcoin mining operations by the end of August, a government agency has confirmed to CoinDesk.  Rumors first emerged online over the weekend after the leak of a government notice issued by Xinjiang's Economic and Information Commission (EIC) indicating the authority was demanding that local utility companies report and shut down illegal bitcoin mining operations.  An official from the commission – a local government agency focused on technological development – confirmed the authenticity of the document to CoinDesk on Monday, saying it was drafted by the EIC's unit in charge of the region's utility issues. No further comments were provided.  According to the document's definition, illegal bitcoin miners refers to any operation that is not registered with the government as a licensed business entity or has been using electricity without formal contracts with utility firms.  It further states that utility companies in the region are now tasked with the mission of shutting down such unlicensed operations and reporting back to the authority on their progress by the end of August.  ""Local utility agencies and companies will be held accountable if they failed to shut down 'illegal' bitcoin mining operations,"" the EIC writes.  The effort follows a notice issued in January that required Xinjiang's utility companies to make regular reports to the authority on local bitcoin activities as part of a wider move to eventually guide these entities to an ""orderly exit"" of the business in the region and nationwide.  That crackdown has already affected miners operating farms in Xinjiang. Scott Meng, the chief executive of a Canadian blockchain startup who also jointly owns mining farms in the region, told CoinDesk that the government's notice early this year ""definitely had impact"" on bitcoin mining operations.  He said:    ""I have two partners (in the region): one has 18,000 crypto miners, the other has 40,000. And they have been crying for help in the past days, urging me to look for places in the U.S. and Canada (as substitutes). But even for me, I have to get electricity first. And even if I had that, we need to build farms from scratch.""            In June 2017, the EIC also issued a notice to municipal governments asking them to be careful when supporting bitcoin mining companies.  ""These operations contribute nothing to the region's economy besides consuming a spiking volume of electricity,"" the EIC said at the time.  Those orders were issued at a time when bitcoin miners were increasingly looking to the cheap electricity and vast land resources available in regions like Xinjiang as means of boosting their operational profits.

42401670,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd23b9,1532343605,Bitcoin Price Hits Two-Month High as Dominance Rate Spikes,"Bitcoin's (BTC) price clocked a two-month high of $7,820 today and looks set to extend gains further, a key cryptomarket gauge indicates.  CoinMarketCap's  bitcoin dominance rate, an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by the leading cryptocurrency, rose to 46 percent today — the highest level since December 20 — adding credence to BTC's 20 percent rally seen in the last seven days.  To start with, a rise in the BTC dominance rate essentially means the number one cryptocurrency is more in demand compared to the alternative cryptocurrencies.  The above chart shows:  The BTC dominance rate has increased from 40.5 percent to 46 percent in the last four weeks.  During the same time period, BTC has rallied from $5,755 (June 25 low) to $7,820, according to Bitfinex.  The fact that the BTC price rally from the seven-month lows below $6,000 is accompanied by the sharp rise in the dominance rate indicates the bargain hunters are likely betting on further sustainable gains in BTC prices and are not buying BTC to venture into alternative cryptocurrencies.  In the latter case, the dominance rate of alternative cryptocurrencies over bitcoin rises sharply. This usually happens when BTC valuations start looking overstretched and in response investors begin rotating money into other innovations (as happened in late December 2017/early January).  So, a sharp rise in the BTC dominance rate, as seen in the last four weeks, could be considered a sign of investor confidence in the current BTC price rally.  Hence, BTC could soon find acceptance above the key 100-day moving average (MA) hurdle and cross the $8,000 mark in a convincing manner.  At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading at $7,700 on Bitfinex — up 3.4 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  The rally post-inverse head-and-shoulders breakout ran out of steam around the 100-day MA in the last five days, establishing the MA as a key technical resistance.  A daily close (as per UTC) above the 100-day MA of $7,610 would further strengthen the bull grip and open the doors to 200-day MA, currently lined up at $8,720.  4-hour chart  BTC is stuck in a broadening wedge — a continuation pattern, meaning an upside break would revive the rally from the July 17 low of $6,740 and open up upside towards the next major resistance located at $8,720 (200-day MA hurdle).  The 50-candle, 100-candle, and 200-candle MAs are trending north and positioned one above the other in favor of the bulls. So, BTC is more likely to witness an upside breakout.  That said, the bears could make a strong comeback if the broadening wedge is breached to the downside.  View  A spike in the BTC dominance rate validates the short-term bullish outlook.  A convincing break above the 100-day MA of $7,610 would only bolster the already bullish technical setup and could yield a test of 200-day MA of $8,720.  A break below $7,190 (broadening wedge floor) would invalidate the bullish view.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42401666,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd23VF,1532332803,Don't Let the Crypto Circus in Congress Fool You,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Progress?  Judging from the most eye-catching headlines from two separate hearings on Capitol Hill Wednesday, it's tempting to conclude there has been little of it from U.S. regulators and legislators in their comprehension of cryptocurrencies these past five years.  In fact, Rep. Brad Sherman's laughable suggestion during a House Financial Services Committee hearing in the house that the U.S. ban mining and purchases of bitcoin could suggest we've gone backward since bitcoin was first discussed in Congress in the fall of 2013.  At that time, the sight of Jennifer Shasky Calvery, then-director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), telling bitcoin exchanges and wallets they needed to register with FinCEN, was ultimately viewed positively by crypto enthusiasts. In showing that regulators like her weren't inherently hostile to cryptocurrencies, Calvery's comments led to a doubling in bitcoin's price over the following two weeks to more than $1,100 in early December.  Now, five years on, some officials do sound a bit hostile.  At a separate hearing the same day as Sherman's grandstanding, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said cryptocurrencies are ""great if you're trying to hide or launder money."" Had he noticed how the FBI had traced the bitcoin transactions of the 12 Russians indicted last week for trying to tamper with U.S. elections?  The folly of his position was indirectly identified over at the other hearing, where Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee Michael Conaway — who presumably did not intend to take a dig at the Fed Chairman — joked, ""As long as the stupid criminals keep using bitcoin, it'll be great.""  It's best to look beyond the eye-catching headlines, however. In the wider context, it's clear that we have actually come some way forward in regulatory comprehension of this technology. And that's a good thing.  The sheer frequency with which governments, both here and in the rest of the world, are engaging on the topic is itself acknowledgment that it's an important development that's here to stay. It's hard to keep track of how many hearings, symposiums, workshops and conferences are either sponsored by governments or attended by their officials. Consider also how dozens of law firms, a community that's constantly interacting with both regulators and legislators, either have crypto practices or are doing research and education into how the law should deal with this issue.  The folks at Coin Center and others in the crypto space who've been engaging with regulators since 2013 remark that non-political staff members from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Exchange Commission and various other agencies are now much more comfortable using the language of this industry than back then.  This is the gradual way that change occurs within the creaking bureaucracy of Washington.  The influence of a parallel market  Part of this shifting tide reflects the unavoidable reality of crypto markets, which have grown massively since 2013.  Skeptics who cite a lack of clear real-world applications for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology fail to see that the trading in bitcoin and tokens they dismiss as hollow speculation represents such an application. It marks a major shift in how money is gathered, exchanged and allocated.  Notwithstanding problems of measurement, the almost $300 billion that CoinMarketCap says is the crypto market's total market capitalization is a historically significant figure. Even after its correction from a high above $800 billion in early January, the number belies the presence of an emerging, parallel capital market.  Much of that market will get shaken out and hundreds of coins will die, but others will emerge and, amid a mix of earnest offerings, scams, game-changing business models, big dreams and total flops, a unique new, gatekeeper-less market for ideas will arise.  It's much like the Wild West, perhaps, but the Wild West gave rise to the vibrant, innovative economy of Northern California. Is something similar happening here in a more geography-agnostic way?  And, over time, there has been real human growth, too. Worldwide usage and trading, despite the market correction since January, remain many times larger than they were in 2013. Coinbase and Blockchain.com alone are now running more than 20 million wallets each. There are more than 200 crypto exchanges, where more than $16 billion is changing hands daily in dozens of countries. The dollar amounts are still small compared with the trillions traded in traditional fiat capital markets, but they are by no means insignificant.  These numbers mean that governments are compelled to pay attention to this sector. Powell might be currently saying that crypto markets are too small to threaten financial stability, and therefore for the Fed to regulate them, but he will keep being pestered by lawmakers and their staff, as well as those of other government agencies, for his opinion on them.  Why? Because too many people and too much money is engaged in this industry for anyone in politics and policymaking to ignore.  International competition  Adding to this is the matter of global competition.  Various jurisdictions are taking stances that proactively encourage crypto and blockchain development, in part because they're eager to attract some of that capital flow and in part because they want to promote innovation.  Singapore, Switzerland, Malta and Bermuda are all emerging as important new domiciles for ICOs. In recognizing concepts such as utility tokens, they are leading what I described two weeks ago as a global policymaker awakening to the innovative possibilities for new forms of economic design and value exchange.  Meanwhile, Japan has encouraged cryptocurrency transactions with some clear and fair regulations around them. And South Korea has just offered new tax perks to blockchain startups.  This is the backdrop to Wednesday's testimony from former CFTC chairman Gary Gensler – now a lecturer at MIT's Sloan School of Management and, with me, an advisor to the Digital Currency Initiative at MIT Media Lab – in which he urged legislators to enact clear rules for ICOs and cypto-tokens to instill confidence in the sector and avoid an innovation exodus.  When a respected former regulator says an industry like this matters, it resonates with the Washington crowd.  Yes, it's baffling that Rep. Sherman and his ilk can still, after all this time, believe it would be a good idea to ban bitcoin, a decentralized, authority-less system for communicating information. Perhaps he was doing the bidding of his campaign donors, the top three of which in 2018 are from traditional finance and payments companies.  In any case, he's irrelevant to the evolution of this industry. In the end, people like him will be overwhelmed by the many more who get it.

According to a statement issued on Sunday, finance ministers and central bank governors of the G20 member countries hosted a meeting during the weekend and reiterated their position on a plan for ""vigilant"" monitoring of cryptocurrencies.

Yet, due to a rising number of strategic partners and interest in its token, the project announced on Medium, ""The demand for UUU tokens has exceeded our current designated holdings.""  The post continued:  ""The team now faces a problem: leaving our ecosystem tokens intact, how do we pursue these new opportunities to grow the U Network ecosystem?""  The result is a problem that seems to have little precedent.  The structure of ICOs and airdrops varies widely across projects, particularly with regard to the number of tokens minted, distributed and maintained by a given company or non-profit. While some projects do not limit the number of tokens that can be created within their blockchain ecosystem, others, like U Network, choose to implement a cap on the total supply.  For U Network, the 10 billion limit was implemented because the content-centered project, which aims to ""help online content platforms better align with the interests of their users,"" wanted to ""provide sufficient incentives to community members.""  While U Network's dilemma is currently an outlier in the industry, other blockchains that have implemented hard caps on their ICOs and airdrops may soon find themselves in a similar quandary as they begin building their ecosystems.  Likewise, U Network's situation may force similar projects to confront an even more difficult question: what happens when your startup runs out of its own tokens?  Method to the madness  Incentives are especially important in blockchain systems, and so far, there is no established methodology by which projects can determine how many tokens to issue and keep.  That's according to Joshua Gans, a professor of strategic management at the University of Toronto, who told CoinDesk: ""There is no metric.""  ""If you want to use tokens for incentives, the amount of the incentive is dependent on the price of the token,"" he explained. ""At the start, it is hard to predict that.""  Gans added that establishing the amount of tokens projects should keep is equally as unsystematic.  According to Catherine Tucker, a professor of management and marketing at MIT, projects face a doubly difficult situation in the highly scrutinized industry. Not only do they lack methodologies for determining token supplies and holdings, they must also consider the perception of their actions.  ""I think this case illustrates the huge trade-offs founders face,"" she told CoinDesk. ""If they keep too many tokens in reserve, they are often accused of being greedy. But if they give away too many tokens then they lose a crucial lever they need to incentivize people to use their platform or service in the future.""  The buy-back  As such, remedying a shortage of tokens looks to be a precarious task. Solutions such as increasing the token supply of the network could influence the token's price, angering investors and jeopardizing their trust in the project.  So instead, U Network plans to refurbish its holdings by conducting a token ""buy-back."" In practice, this means it will re-purchase 1,000 ETH worth of UUU (about 284 million tokens at press time) from current token holders over the course of several stages.  ""For the first stage we would be buying back 200 ETH worth of UUU between the price range of 0.004 and 0.005 USD,"" U Network told CoinDesk. At press time, one UUU token was valued at $0.001569.  As for how the project determined the number of tokens to re-purchase, it explained, ""We believe it's a reasonable amount. Not too high to affect market price, not too low to affect the expansion needs.""  From Gans' perspective, the buy-back is ""a good way to go."" He went on, ""You issue the tokens and retain some other currency to use for buy-backs if you make an error. The other option is to give yourself the ability to issue more tokens for incentive purposes but that is ultimately the same as retaining some tokens at the outset.""  And as for what the rest of the industry could do to avoid U Network's dilemma, MIT's Tucker suggested:  ""If I had to give advice to founders, it would be to think about the uncertainty involved with the project. In those cases of heightened uncertainty, it might be best to limit the initial distribution of tokens until the business plan has evolved and been tested.""

42401671,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd23aA,1532313962,Bitcoin's Price Sets Sights on $8K After Sunday Sell-off,"Bitcoin's price continues to hold ground amid a market sell-off, with growing momentum building to take out its next target of $8,000.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell 3 percent over the weekend, hitting $7,333, according to Bitfinex data, after a quick sell-off from investors dragged down market prices.  As it turns out, bitcoin is slowly regaining and consolidating its losses to stand at $7,637.38 as of press time. The crypto shows strong signs of a steady recovery to retest the upper resistances found at $7,575 and $7,694 (the market's previous close and the previous high).  The previous exponential moving average (EMA) bull cross, last seen yesterday, foretold a bullish break above the previous resistance at $7,370, which saw prices rise three percent, paving the way for the sell-off that occurred just hours ago.  However, if the current momentum continues, expect the 55-period-EMA (red) to cross the short-term averages (8,21) once more, creating another potential bullish setup as it edges closer toward its next psychological target of $8,000.  Watch for consistent hourly closings above the next bull target of $7,575 (the top of the previous high) to confirm a bullish continuation.  Another factor adding to bullish sentiment is the amount of increasingly bullish volume, lending credence to the bullish bias which has already surpassed the previous hourly total of 972 million to stand at 1.379 million, according to Bitfinex data.  Conversely, if the bulls are unable to maintain the same amount of volume in the coming hours, expect prices to stall as buying and price action come to a grinding halt once more.  The daily trend continues to squeeze prices inside a tightening range between $7,374 and $7,575, potentially igniting the fire needed to propel investors toward the elusive target of $8,000.  Bearish technicals in both the Relative Strength Index and MACD could stall prices in the short-term, which may last briefly as the hunt continues.  Bull View  Another sell-off would be likely to reset both the MACD and RSI readings, only this time the bulls would like to close above $7,575 (resistance turned support) after a run-up to $8,000.  Price hurtling toward a breakout from the tightening range after a recovery from the recent sell-off.  Bulls continue to show up and countertrade the sell-offs, adding to the possibility of ""FOMO"" (Fear of missing out) amongst traders.  Bear View  The daily RSI is approaching overbought territory after holding above 63.00 for quite some time and could act as a major deterrent for new money coming into the market in the short-term.  The bullish daily MACD also shows signs of waning price action, with the histogram ticking down and the signal line beginning to curve lower.
