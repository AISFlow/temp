The regulator announced late Friday that it was charging two individuals using the names Morgan Hunt and Kim Hecroft for ""fraudulent solicitation, impersonation of a CFTC investigator and forging CFTC documents"" as part of an elaborate scheme to convince cryptocurrency investors to pay a fake tax in bitcoin to the defendants.  According to a press release, Hunt, who claims to be of Arlington, Texas and may be doing business as Diamonds Trading Investment House, and Hecroft, who claims to be from Baltimore, Maryland and may be doing business as First Options Trading, ""engaged in a fraudulent scheme to solicit bitcoin from members of the public.""  Moreover, the two did so ""through false or misleading representations or omissions,"" according to a release, which include impersonating a CFTC investigator and forging documents with an official CFTC seal and bearing the CFTC's general counsel's name.  The pair have successfully defrauded at least two customers, according to the release. At least one of these victims was persuaded to send bitcoin to the pair.  Among the charges, the release notes, is the claim that the defendants forged a document stating that bitcoin investors needed to pay taxes to the regulator if they wished to withdraw their bitcoin.  CFTC director of enforcement James McDonald said in a statement that ""increased public awareness of the CFTC's involvement in policing the virtual currency markets has, unfortunately, provided new opportunities for bad actors.""  He added:  ""As alleged in the complaint, defendants sought to exploit public trust in the CFTC through forged documents purporting to be official CFTC memoranda requiring the payment of a tax on cryptocurrency accounts. The CFTC does not collect taxes. The CFTC is on guard against fraudsters who try to take advantage of the CFTC's reputation in order to cheat customers, and will take swift action against such misconduct.""  The CFTC is looking to seek restitution for the victims, the disgorgement of any gains, penalties, a permanent trading and registration ban for each defendant and a permanent injunction against any further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and agency regulations.

The Samourai Wallet's latest release includes a number of changes, including the fact that it is now available in 12 different languages, according to a blog post. However, the most significant change will see the three-year-old platform change from showing stored bitcoin amounts in a U.S. dollar equivalent to showing them only in either bitcoin or satoshis.  According to the post, the company made the move to force users into transacting with bitcoins, saying ""we believe it is fundamental that our existing and future users understand that when they transact within the Bitcoin network, when they participate in the Bitcoin economy, they are transacting with the token native to the Bitcoin network, BTC, and nothing else.""  The post explained that when Samourai first began, its founders included a dollar conversion for users' convenience.  However, it added:  ""We are now nearing the end of 2018 and realize that users will never be ready. Thinking in fiat currency terms is familiar, you likely interact with it all the time. This is precisely the reason that within the context of a Bitcoin wallet it is a crutch. We have made the decision that as of version 0.98.87 to remove that crutch.""  While the move may inconvenience some users, the post said, the company still believes it is necessary.  That being said, the post noted, ""we have decided to keep fiat currency conversion within the Sentinel Watch Only app, as independent merchants who frequently use the app and other use cases require the use of a currency conversion function.""

42381281,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94VTT,1538165136,Ethereum Security Lead Joins Effort to Oust Blockchain's Big Miners,"A notable voice is joining the ranks of ethereum developers who are seeking to block powerful ASIC miners from earning an outsized share of the platform's valuable ether cryptocurrency.  In an developer meeting Friday, Martin Holst Swende, security lead at the Ethereum Foundation, said he supports swift action to remove ASIC mining hardware from the ethereum platform. Joining the non-profit in 2016, Swende now works to ensure code changes do not disrupt or harm operations on the world's second-largest blockchain.  With the remarks, Swende is aligning with other leading technologists who work on the platform's core code and who think steps should be taken to block the chips. First introduced on ethereum back in April, dissenting developers argue the chips may reduce the number of participants able to profitably maintain the network's ledger.  In the meeting, Swende remarked that a software change, dubbed ProgPoW, should be implemented ""in parallel"" with a larger, upcoming upgrade, ""if the technical underpinnings are there.""  As detailed by CoinDesk, the software change would render current ethereum ASICs unusable, and potentially prevent the development of such hardware going forward.  He said:  ""I think it's a very good change and am for including it as soon as possible.""  Swende also noted after the meeting in email to CoinDesk that unlike other proposals for software upgrades on ethereum that affect smart contract deployment on the platform, ProgPow would ""not touch the EVM or state transition at all.""  As such, Swende noted that testing for the proposal could be implemented on ""a totally separate testbed"" in parallel to the normal testing process currently at a bottleneck due to preparation for ethereum's upcoming hard fork.  The upgrade, also known as Constantinople, has been in the works for months, with developers convening and reconvening on the priority issues needing to be addressed. As of today's meeting, the upgrade is due to activate on ethereum testnet Ropsten on October 9 (it's estimated to occur at block 4.2 million).  Speaking on a forum prior to today's meeting, Swende proposed the software change to be implemented in a ""separate hard fork which is decoupled from Constantinople.""  ""If we eventually decide to set both [upgrades] to the same [block] number, then fine, but that's not a necessity,"" the developer wrote.  Developers also said that a cost optimization upgrade geared toward reducing the cost of privacy on ethereum authored by Antonio Salazar Cardozo could be implemented in a subsequent hard fork along with the ProgPoW software shift.  Concerns remain  Still, speaking in the meeting, core developers Pawel Bylica and Alexey Akhunov said the ProgPow proposal needs further work to explain how it can achieve its claims. In response, representatives from the developer group working on ProgPow cited ""misinformation about hardware and how ProgPow actually works.""  Responding to the confusion, ProgPow co-creator ""Def"" emphasized that a ""deep dive"" could be done to better corroborate the aims of the proposal.  In essence, however, Def highlighted that:  ""The algorithm's goal is not exactly to be ASIC-resistant.""  This is because, in one sense, all general processing units (GPUs) if utilized for the express purpose of mining can be thought of as ASICs, in that they effectively are operated to mine ether.  As a result, Def posits that the design of ProgPow is not to be ASIC resistant but rather ""to be friendly or very much tied to a single type of ASIC, which is a GPU,"" with these having the advantages of being lower cost for miners in the ethereum community to acquire.  For her part, Def's colleague, Kristy-Leigh Minehan, emphasized the importance of continued developer support for the idea, claiming that it wasn't worth ""wasting the man hours or the money"" for ""a project that would most likely be ignored.""

42381286,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94VVz,1538160316,WSJ Investigation Alleges $88 Million Laundered Through 46 Crypto Exchanges,"Nearly $90 million potentially associated with criminal activity was laundered through 46 cryptocurrency exchanges, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday.  In particular, the Journal reported, some $9 million was laundered through ShapeShift AG, the Erik Voorhees-led cryptocurrency exchange known for allowing users to maintain their anonymity, over a two-year period. Moreover, this was the largest sum laundered through any single U.S.-based exchange on its list.  The Journal's investigation tracked funds from more than 2,500 crypto wallet addresses associated with reported criminal activity, finding that $88.6 million was laundered through the exchanges. ShapeShift, it claims, was ""the largest recipient of the funds with a U.S. presence,"" noting that while it is registered in Switzerland, it is operated in the U.S. state of Colorado.  Reporters gave ShapeShift a list of addresses deemed ""suspicious,"" which the exchange then banned, chief legal officer Veronica McGregor said, according to the article.  The report described how it traced funds from one fraudulent scheme to exchanges, explaining that reporters followed transactions and wallet addresses on the ethereum blockchain to ShapeShift and KuCoin. At ShapeShift, some $517,000 in ethereum was converted to monero, where the trail went dark, as an example.  The report's timing is notable, coming just weeks after ShapeShift announced it would enforce ""know-your-customer"" rules beginning next month.  McGregor told the Journal that the move was ""not in response to any regulatory enforcement action,"" but rather, as part of an effort to ""de-risk"" the exchange.  Her statement echoed comments by Voorhees, who told CoinDesk that the move was a ""proactive"" step to forestall any future regulatory action.  ""It was a strategic decision as we believe the risk of not doing so had gotten too great. It was not made lightly,"" he said.

In the letter  , Representatives Ted Budd, Warren Davidson, Tom Emmer and Darren Soto, along with 11 co-signers, request that Clayton clarify how it is approaching token sales, saying that ""current uncertainty surrounding the treatment of offers and sales of digital tokens is hindering innovation in the United States and will ultimately drive business elsewhere.""  The letter continues, saying:  ""We believe the SEC could do more to clarify its position. Additionally, we are concerned about the use of enforcement actions alone to clarify policy and believe that formal guidance may be an appropriate approach to clearing up legal uncertainties which are causing the environment for the development of innovative technologies in the United States to be unnecessarily fraught.""  As such, the letter continues, the lawmakers are asking the SEC to clarify when token sales should be classified as ""investment contracts,"" whether a token sold as a security can later become a non-security and what tools are available for the ""SEC to offer more concrete guidance to innovators.""  The letter does not provide a timeline, noting that ""such guidance will, reasonably, take time, caution and deep consideration."" As such, the letter says the questions are aimed at providing formal guidance in the long-term.  Friday's letter comes just days after Davidson hosted a forum in Washington, D.C. asking leaders in the cryptocurrency space to express any grievances they had with regulations in the U.S.  During the forum, multiple representatives from blockchain startups, cryptocurrency exchanges and venture capital funds emphasized the need for clarity around token sales.  While the SEC has, to date, focused on enforcement actions against malicious actors, CoinList general counsel Georgia Quinn noted that these actions have not provided a clear explanation of what is allowable within the U.S.  This lack of clarity has pushed businesses to leave the nation outright, said Joyce Lai from ConsenSys.

Tron announced Thursday that its forthcoming Project Atlas would connect BitTorrent and Tron, hoping to make the BitTorrent protocol faster for peers, as well as encourage both new and existing users to run the file sharing protocol for longer periods of time, according to a press release.  BitTorrent seeders, or users storing and sharing files being downloaded, will earn Tron's TRX tokens for remaining online for longer periods of time, as well as for ""dedicating more of their bandwidth and storage to ensure that swarms are faster and live longer.""  Moreover, users downloading content can pay seeders with tokens as part of this incentive program, the company's website added.  Tron founder and CEO Justin Sun said the move is ""the foundation for a new way of content distribution,"" according to a statement.  He added:  ""To start, the product will feature faster downloads, more seeds, no mining, and backward compatibility. It is adapted to the world we live in today: mobile, connected, and transparent. We aim to eventually empower all content creators and their communities by eliminating the middleman and enabling content creators to distribute directly to users.""  The press release emphasized that because the Tron protocol uses Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) as its consensus mechanism, users will not be mining the token on their machines. Instead, token rewards will be ""based on resources provided.""  The move appears to be optional – BitTorrent will still remain free to use, according to the press release.  Tron's announcement comes a month after CoinDesk reported that several employees at BitTorrent had left the company, at least in part due to the direction it seemed to be taking under its new leadership.

Pornhub had an average of 81 million visitors per day last year, according to its own figures, which adds up to around 28.5 billion in total. Hence, less than 1 percent could still be a not-so-tiny number. However, the company doesn't give out the proportion of visitors that actually pay for the paid premium service, as TNW points out.  Despite the low take-up figure, the company is staying positive on the potential of the tech, telling the news source:  ""That being said, we expect to see widespread adoption of crypto and blockchain on our site in the near future.""  As reported by CoinDesk, Pornhub first announced it would accept cryptocurrency payments back in April, when it struck a deal with verge to use its token.

As part of that effort, LINE will also begin offering its link token to markets outside Japan through its BitBox exchange next month, although not within the U.S.  The dapps specifically will be called Wizball, which rewards users for answering questions; 4CAST, which creates a prediction market; Pasha, which rewards users for posting product reviews; TAPAS, which similarly rewards users for posting food reviews; and STEP, which incentivizes users to ""share their stories of recreational activities and holiday trips.""  While the review dapps will be released sometime in 2018, no timeline was provided for for Wizball or 4CAST, both of which remain in beta versions at the moment. Moreover, the latter two are in Japanese only for the moment.  The moves are part of a broader effort to build a ""co-creation economy,"" the company explained.

42381277,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94VLv,1538141453,Tech Giant GMO Wants to Help You Mine Zcash – For a Cut,"Japanese IT giant GMO Internet has made another move into the cryptocurrency mining business.  In an announced Friday, the company said it has rolled out a mining software client called Cryptknocker that is designed to let would-be miners mine Equihash algorithm-based cryptocurrencies like zcash using graphic processing units (GPUs) – as found in many home PCs.  GMO said the software is being made available for download for free, although it will charge 2 percent of a users' mining profits to compensate for its development costs.  It further says that the software is designed to suit miners using NVIDIA graphics cards to mine zcash, claiming a 2-percent efficiency gain over other software – an edge would be negated by the company's cut, however, if it turns out to be verified.  The firm's move into zcash mining comes despite a decline in profits from its bitcoin mining business in recent months.  As CoinDesk reported in August, while GMO made a profit of $2.3 million in the second quarter this year, a major portion of that arose from its crypto exchange business.  ""Mining profitability declined due to deterioration of the macro environment such as stagnation of bitcoin price,"" the company said at the time.  Even so, in June, GMO announced the launch of one of the world's first bitcoin miners to feature a 7nm ASIC processor, which is scheduled to start shipping next month.  The new mining client will have stiff competition too, as it comes after the zcash community has voted not to prioritize efforts to revise the zcash blockchain's code in order be ASIC-resistant, as CoinDesk also previously reported.  That discussion followed debate earlier this year in which crypto mining giant Bitmain launched a dedicated ASIC mining machine for zcash, which could make GPU or CPU (central processing unit) mining much less attractive for would-be miners.

42381276,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94VKf,1538136915,The $1 Trillion Wallet: BitGo's Big Plan to Secure the Biggest Bitcoin Fortunes,"The stakes must have seemed high already in 2013, when the largest bitcoin wallets safeguarded by blockchain security provider BitGo held about $10 million-worth of the cryptocurrency.  Later on, in 2015 they crept up to around $100 million. And what had perhaps been unthinkable in the years previous, by 2017 the largest crypto wallets in BitGo's charge reached close to $1 billion.  Looking ahead to the next milestone, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe will give a talk next month at Stanford University entitled ""Securing the Trillion Dollar Wallet."" In a world of tokenized everything – not to mention hedge funds and other institutions redefining the meaning of a whale crypto investor – this no longer seems far-fetched.  ""Now we are really thinking, what's it going to take to secure a trillion dollars?"" Belshe told CoinDesk. ""It may be a little far away, but we have to start thinking about it now; we have to start designing it now in order to get there.""  Designing a system like this involves a complex blend of hardware and software, policies and procedures, not to mention meeting externally audited regulatory requirements (BitGo recently received approval in the U.S.to act as a qualified custodian for digital assets on behalf of institutional investors).  However, as one security consultant told Belshe's team, building a secure vault for such a large sum of money basically comes down to two things: kids and fingers.  It's one thing to keep the cryptographic private key controlling a bitcoin wallet in cold storage, i.e. on a piece of paper or a hardware device disconnected from the internet and locked in a safe. But if a bad guy comes into your office and is ready to cut off your finger or put a gun to your child's head, what are you going to do? Obviously, quick and ready access to those assets means the security will be cracked.  The trick is to marry technology with process and controls such that it's difficult to get the money out – or at least so that moving the vast majority of the assets involves lots of independent, separate people whose key signatures are all required, said Belshe.  He added:  ""Some of the technology guys out there are saying, 'hey we can get you out of cold storage in 10 minutes.' I'm sorry, but if you can get a billion dollars out of cold storage in 10 minutes, that means there's somebody's finger that you can threaten.""  Big money  Stepping back, becoming a qualified custodian has taken Belshe years and has seen BitGo come close to acquiring qualified custodian Kingdom Trust, before going it alone to establish BitGo Trust.  With the addition of a regulated trust function, BitGo, which currently handles around $15 billion in monthly crypto transactions, is arguably pulling ahead in the race to secure digital assets for the institutional set. Competitors in this space include the hardware maker Ledger, the traditional U.S. custodial bank Northern Trust, and blockchain startup itBit.  But Belshe views the inevitable evolution towards digital assets as a rising tide that will benefit everyone in the industry. He also admitted clients are really looking for custodians with big balance sheets, something which BitGo does not have today.  ""I would love if the big players came in and put their balance sheet behind the security of their custodianship of digital assets. It would be amazing for all of us,"" he said.  Since the 2008 crash, the onus has been on diversifying custody arrangements, something the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has encouraged. These days, hedge funds will often be using 15 to 20 custodians with perhaps only 5% in each to limit their exposure, noted Belshe.  He said BitGo has been in talks with many hedge funds and found there are ""literally dozens"" that can't wait to use its trust service.  In the detail, achieving parity with established qualified custody providers involves gaining third-party certification of policies and procedures, or SOCs (system and organization controls). BitGo has now attained SOC I and II certifications, with the auditing of those carried out by Deloitte.  It's a length which few, if any, other crypto companies have gone to, said Belshe, and it encompasses a wide range of eventualities.  ""You can have the most secure software in the world and the most secure hardware. But inside your company what's the policy for keeping things safe? What happens if your data center goes down?"" he said. ""We have policy, procedures and plans for all this, that have been tested and are in place.""  Insurance claims  Following BitGo's qualified custodian announcement, the startup's next big step is a crypto insurance product to be released within a couple of months. Such insurance typically covers investors for risks such as theft.  BitGo wouldn't write the policies, but rather white-label the product with an established insurer. Belshe wants to do this right and has amassed a deep knowledge of the subject along the way. The experience has left him circumspect whenever he hears about crypto insurance being offered in the market.  ""The insurance claims out there are wide and wild and often not really of value,"" Belshe said (meaning ""claims"" as in representations about insurance, not requests for payment from an insurer). ""Anybody that's looking at insurance, or a provider that claims to be insured, ask them to really show you what the [coverage] limits are.""  This can take some digging. As hard as it is to differentiate BitGo's cold storage from somebody else's cold storage solution, it's equally hard to differentiate one claim of full insurance from another, said Belshe. Oftentimes, you're dealing with small policies of $10 million or less that may not even cover theft.  Typically the questions that need answering are: Who is the underwriter? What cases are covered? What about insider theft? What about executive insider theft? What are the caps, what are the deductibles? Can you cover your deductibles?  Belshe acknowledged that underwriters are there to provide a service and don't want to be used as marketing, but in the end, full transparency has to be made available for customers.  Someone offering a great insurance program would find a way to get ""solid green lights"" from anyone who wanted to review it, even if they had to do that under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), said Belshe, concluding,  ""If they are not willing to talk to you about it, it's a red flag. I guarantee you, if it's in secret, there's a reason it's in secret.""  Correction: the original version of this story stated that firms were waiting for the end of a 30-day review period to use the qualified custodian service. That review period had ended.

In an announcement to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) Friday, the firm says it has been served with an Originating Application and Statement of Claim in Australia's Federal Court, which has been brought by a group of investors in an initial coin offering (ICO) to which it was an advisor.  The parties are claiming roughly US$1,833,077 plus damages, the company indicates.  DigitalX says it is currently reviewing the claim with its legal team, but it ""denies any claim of wrongdoing and, for reasons that will become apparent as this matter progresses, believes that it has strong grounds to defend any claims bought forward by these applicants.""  DigitalX states:  ""As such, the Company intends to vigorously defend this matter and protect the reputation of the Company.""  As the news broke, shares in the Perth, Australia, and New York-based firm had dropped from a daily high of AUS$0.092 to AUS$0.08, at press time.  The company, which provides ICO and blockchain consulting services and blockchain software development, started off as a bitcoin mining business called DigitalBTC and was one of the first publicly listed bitcoin companies, launching for trading on the ASX back in 2015.  It abandoned mining the same year, amid a price slump at the time, and rebranded as DigitalX a month later as it shifted focus to consumer products including a payments app.  Today's news is not the first time the company has faced legal trouble and, in July 2016, its co-founder, Zhenya Tsvetnenko, resigned after he was indicted by the U.S. government for his alleged involvement in a fraudulent text messaging scheme.

42381289,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94VZl,1538133005,Bitcoin Breakout Elusive As Price Retreats from One-Week Highs,"Bitcoin missed a bull breakout by a whisker, as prices backed off from a six-day high of $6,826 hit earlier today.  BTC's persistent defense of $6,000 over the last three months has convinced many, including billionaire investor Novogratz, that the leading cryptocurrency has bottomed out around that level (February low).  However, a bullish breakout would be confirmed only after the cryptocurrency has found acceptance above the top edge of the three-month-long narrowing price range.  Crossing that key price hurdle is proving a tough task for the bulls, though. For instance, BTC was solidly bid in early European hours, but the bullish momentum ran out of steam as prices neared the upper end of the narrowing price range, currently located at $6,870. As a result, a definitive breakout remains elusive.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,645 on Bitfinex, representing a 2.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Weekly chart  On the weekly chart, the area around $6,000 (February low) has repeatedly capped the downside in BTC, which indicates that sellers have likely run dry, having pushed the cryptocurrency down by 70 percent from its record high of $20,000 hit in December.  Daily chart  As seen in the above chart, BTC has formed a large narrowing price range pattern known as a pennant, over the last three months. A UTC close above the pennant hurdle of $6,870 would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  More importantly, the ensuing bullish move could be a rapid one as a prolonged period of range-bound trading is often followed by a big spike in volatility, according to technical theory.  And, even though the stacking order of the 50-day moving average (MA), below the 100-day MA, below the 200-day MA, is indicating that the path of least resistance is to the downside, price action always takes precedence over lagging indicators like MAs  View  A pennant breakout, if confirmed, would validate the argument that cryptocurrency has carved out a long-term bottom around $6,000 and would open up upside toward May highs above $8,500.  The outlook remains neutral while BTC is trapped inside the narrowing price range.  A downside break of the pennant pattern will likely embolden the bears and allow re-test of the June low of $5,755.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42381284,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94VSD,1538124315,Indian Crypto Exchange Zebpay Halts Trading Over Banking Ban,"Zebpay, once the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume in India, has announced it is halting its trading service later today.    Giving only several hours' notice, the Ahmedabad-based company said in a tweet that, from 16:00 local time (10:30 UTC) on Friday, it will halt its exchange service and cancel all unexecuted orders, crediting the funds to customers' wallets.  ""No new orders will be accepted,"" the exchange said.  In a blog post published today, Zebpay further explained the decision directly results from the ban issued by India's central bank earlier this year that prohibits domestic banks from offering financial services to crypto exchanges.  Although Zebpay continued to explore alternative solutions to ensure India didn't ""miss the bus of digital assets,"" recent months have proven to ""extremely difficult,"" the exchange said, adding:  ""The curb on bank accounts has crippled our, and our customer's, ability to transact business meaningfully. At this point, we are unable to find a reasonable way to conduct the cryptocurrency exchange business. As a result, we are stopping our exchange activities.""  Zebpay stressed that its wallet service will continue to operate even after the exchange halts, saying:  ""Please note that the Zebpay wallet will continue to work even after the exchange stops. You are free to deposit and withdraw coins / tokens into your wallet.""  Based on data from CoinMarketCap, trading volume on Zebpay has been heavily impacted by the Reserve Bank of India's decision.  Following the exchange's announcement in July that it would pause Indian rupee deposits and withdrawals, 24-hour trading volume on the platform plunged from $5 million in early July to currently just a little over $200,000.  As CoinDesk has reported previously, the Indian central bank issued the bank ban in April, after which crypto exchanges filed a petition to the country's supreme court.  Yet, the court said in July that the ban would remain active until it makes a final hearing – which is yet to be conducted after the case was postponed earlier in September.  Zebpay had not responded to a CoinDesk request for comment by press time.

42401934,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2ysv,1538121604,'Tedious But Necessary': Why This Decentralized Exchange Wants a License,"Everbloom, one of numerous so-called decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for cryptocurrencies that have cropped up lately, is seeking to become a licensed broker-dealer in a bid to attract institutional investors.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the startup is registering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is submitting an application for a license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the self-regulatory organization (SRO) for securities dealers. If approved, Everbloom would be allowed to profit from services related to trading securities.  That's a must in the company's view, given the uncertain regulatory environment for tokens issued through initial coin offerings (ICOs), and more specifically the possibility that many of the ERC-20 standard ethereum tokens traded on Everbloom could be deemed securities under U.S. law.  ""Obtaining a broker-dealer license is a long, tedious and expensive endeavor but we believe a necessary one that will ultimately add long-term value to the company and position ourselves well against our competitors,"" said Everbloom chief operating officer Scott Pirrello.  Stepping back, most DEXs today are ""decentralized"" in the sense that they let traders retain custody of their assets and utilize open source platforms that don't necessarily require know-your-customer (KYC) identity checks. Rival startups like 0x generally outsource such operational responsibilities to entities called relayers and focus on maintaining the underlying protocols.  Everbloom takes the opposite approach, aggregating order books from DEX protocol EtherDelta and soon 0x too. It's essentially a central hub for self-custodied swaps on decentralized exchanges.  This may sound ironic if not oxymoronic to some, like punk-pop music or vegan bacon. But, unlike traditional crypto exchanges, Everbloom doesn't deal with custody or approve trades. It offers what Pirello called a ""service-oriented approach"" to self-custody by building compliant reporting and analytics features, plus accounting software, into its platform.  While the DEX concept was originated by hardcore crypto users who despaired of trusting third parties with their funds, it's starting to draw interest from the institutional crowd. These button-down investors may not want to handle custody themselves (and larger ones are required to use a qualified custodian anyway), but they don't want to rely on some shadowy crypto exchange to do it either.  Everbloom CEO Andrew Rollins put it a bit more diplomatically:  ""The appeal of the decentralized or non-custodial exchange approach is they [traders] get to define their own custody solutions.""  After raising $2 million from investors such as Mashable co-founder Frederick Townes, Indicator Ventures, and First Star venture firm's Drew Volpe, an early ethereum investor, Everbloom quietly opened its platform for institutional traders in late July. However, the company won't charge for its services until the FINRA license comes through.  Competitive landscape  Pirrello said he expects it to take at least a year to get an answer from regulators. In the meantime, the Everbloom platform is mostly a slick interface where anyone can search multiple DEXs' order books simultaneously and trade directly using cryptocurrency wallets such as MetaMask.  Users such as the trading firm Makor Capital are already using Everbloom, free of charge, to submit hundreds of orders per day, sometimes to multiple order books at once. These orders include roughly 900 prospective trading pairs from 140,000 offers aggregated from various DEX platforms.  Newblock Capital managing partner AJ Nary, a fund that invests in both tokens and equity, told CoinDesk that although he sees the irony in creating intermediaries for decentralized platforms, it's important to have ""a comfortable trading platform"" for his institutional clients. Nary already uses Everbloom himself and is laying the groundwork for his fund to follow suit.  Having a team at the DEX startup to call if something were to go wrong is an important factor when he selects which platform to use. For Nary, the prospect of compliant reporting features is also a considerable draw.  Even so, there are plenty of DEX startups joining the broader industry ""arms race"" for institutional users. As such, Everbloom will need more than a license and help hotline to distinguish itself.  In addition to the features described above, Everbloom also controls a central portal through which it can offer closed trading groups for accredited investors with third-party KYC certification. Yet the rival DEX startup AirSwap also offers closed trading pools with outsourced KYC through the fintech startup Wyre.  DEX creator Trey Griffith, co-founder of the rival startup SparkSwap, said liquidity for large-scale orders will be the key to attracting enterprise users because few DEXs will dominate volume down the road, adding:  ""Whoever gathers significant volume is probably going to win.""  Speaking to this focus on volume through aggregation, Rollins said users can congregate on Everbloom and prove legitimacy for orders across the DEX ecosystem. ""The idea behind this is to bridge different pools of liquidity,"" he said.

42422911,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qz9h,1538116229,Chinese Arbitrator Builds Online Ruling System on a Blockchain,"An arbitration body in the Chinese city of Nanjing has launched an online ruling system that it says has a built-in blockchain network for depositing and storing data in legal disputes.  The Nanjing Arbitration Committee announced on Thursday that the online platform is now live in a testing phase. Data uploaded to the system will be stored in a distributed fashion among participating nodes, such as evidence deposition platforms, financial institutions, and other arbitration committees.  China enacted a law in 1995 enabling city governments to form arbitration committees that have the legal authority to rule on economic disputes relating to contract issues in areas such as business, finance and real estate.  The Nanjing committee said the online system allows parties involved in contract disputes to view digital evidence simultaneously over a tamper-proof and distributed network. The integration of blockchain tech is aimed to facilitate the issuing of rulings within 30 days following a filing and to also lower the costs incurred during legal disputes.  The move follows a recent announcement from China's Supreme Court, indicating it recognized evidence stored and authenticated by a blockchain network as legally valid in online ruling procedures across internet courts in the country.  Furthermore, the Nanjing Arbitration Committee is not the first entity to have utilized blockchain in a ruling procedure.  According to a March report from the Xinhua news agency, the Guangzhou Arbitration Committee has worked with Tencent-owned WeBank – one of the first online-only banks in China – to move loan data to a blockchain system as part of a trial.  Whenever a loan default occurs, the Guangzhou committee can automatically issue a ruling based on the loan information stored on a blockchain to all parties involved in the contract, the report said at the time.

42401942,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2z4j,1538107531,History Repeating? Why Ether's Price Just Might Have Bottomed Out,"In crypto markets, history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme.  In light of ether's emphatic and near 40 percent recovery in price since mid-September, there's reason to believe the calls for a ""bottom"" in the price of ethereum's cryptocurrency ether (ETH) do have some merit. As it turns out, the current market structure of ETH against its BTC pair is very similar to that of the structure formed during its bottom in December of 2017 before its more than 400 percent bull run.  There is a concept known as ""fractals"" in technical analysis, which is essentially repeating market structures. Since technical analysis is largely the study of investor behavior, there is a case for theorizing that a repeated market structure can resolve similar to how it did in the past.  If this were to come to fruition, a bottom in ETH/BTC would act as a leading indicator for its USD pair and for the altcoin market in general. Since the majority of altcoins are programmed following the ERC-20 token standard using the ethereum blockchain, there has long been a positive correlation between the performance of ETH and the rest of the altcoin market.  ETH/BTC Past and Present  In the above chart, the left panel represents the 2017 market bottom for ETH/BTC after an 84 percent decline from an all-time high of 0.1515 and the right panel represents the current market structure whose bottom is a similar 82 percent decline from all-time highs.  Visually, the two market structures look similar, but there are three distinct similarities that are worth exploring below.  Higher highs, lows, and 0.5 retracement  Forming a low above a previous low is known as a ""higher low (HL)"" and is a sign of bullish move gathering momentum. Further, a ""higher high (HH)"" pattern also indicates that the bull market is strengthening.  This HL-HH pattern is evident in both charts on the 4-hour time frame and interestingly, the second higher low in both structures formed on the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement.  EMAs and price  Exponential moving averages (EMAs) are created by averaging the price of an asset over a specified period of time while putting more weight on recent price information. The tool is useful for traders because price tends to find support or resistance on the EMAs, and the longer the period, the stronger its effect.  The 100 and 200-period EMAs are highlighted in both charts because the way price reacted to them is very comparable. In both cases, the ETH/BTC ratio struggled to find acceptance above the 200 EMA (purple). The price fell back to the 100 EMA (yellow) where it found support and formed its second higher low.  Interestingly, history is rhyming at near identical price levels.  Rising Wedge  Last but not the least, the rising wedge breakdown confirmed earlier this month looks similar to the one we saw in December 2016.  It is worth noting that the rising wedge is a bearish reversal pattern and is expected to produce a significant sell-off upon confirmation. However, if a significant sell-off does not materialize, then the emboldened bulls usually make a strong comeback, the way they did in December 2017.  A similar thing may happen this time as ETH/BTC has bounced off the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement, giving hope to bulls that the breakdown may once again be short-lived.  Devil's Advocate  Using fractals to compare past and present market structures is speculative in nature since history never repeats exactly as it did before. It's worth playing devil's advocate to identify differences between the two structures and how things might go awry.  Flipping resistance to support is a bullish price development which was evident in the 2017 market structure but is lacking in the current structure. As can be seen, price in 2017 was able to form its second higher low directly on top of what was a prior resistance level, a bullish sign.  Once again, price found support on top of prior resistance when it spilled out of form its rising wedge, further showing its bullish strength. The current market structure could be seen as less bullish since it failed to hold prior resistance as strong support when it formed its second higher low.  ETH still has some proving to do, and there's no guarantee this will play out, but it will surely be something interesting watch unfold over the coming days.

42401930,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2yut,1538100607,Sierra Leone to Develop Blockchain-Based ID Platform With UN Partnership,"Two United Nations divisions are teaming with the nation of Sierra Leone and a technology non-profit to launch a blockchain-based identification system.  The U.N. Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), along with Sierra Leone president Julius Maada Bio and non-profit Kiva announced a project to ""modernize the credit bureau"" on Thursday during the 73rd session of the U.N. General Assembly.  According to Kiva  , Sierra Leone was chosen as it only has one credit bureau that serves 2,000 people, or less than 1 percent of the country's total population. Further, 80 percent of the citizens of Sierra Leone remain unbanked.  In a statement, UNCDF's deputy executive secretary Xavier Michon said the nation may leapfrog ahead of other nations by implementing a new model for banking its citizens.  He said:  ""Through this implementation, Sierra Leone is setting out to build one of the most advanced, secure credit bureaus. It could serve as a model for both developing and developed nations in the future and has the potential to radically change the landscape of financial inclusion.""  The project hopes to provide each of the citizens of Sierra Leone with personal identification tools and a personal digital wallet with their credit history.  The Kiva Protocol, the system that promises the citizens full control of their personal data, will allow the citizens to record all borrowing and repayment transactions on its blockchain. Government and non-Kiva partners can use the credit score on the Kiva blockchain as a valid credit score before commissioning loans.  Citizens can choose to reveal their score to whoever they please, giving residents greater control of their data and credit score, according to the announcement.
