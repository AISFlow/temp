42425413,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7Rh,1392066830,"Despite Russian Trade Ties, Lithuania Looks to Europe for Bitcoin Regulation Lead","Following a string of similar announcements from Estonia and Russia, the Central Bank of Lithuania issued a warning to its citizens regarding the use of bitcoin and other virtual currencies on 31st January.      Now, two weeks later it has clarified its intent, indicating that the possibility of new regulation remains ""under discussion"", but that it would likely monitor decisions from Europe before enacting any laws.      Speaking to CoinDesk, the Central Bank of Lithuania expanded upon earlier warnings that suggested the eastern European nation may issue ""an official ban"" on currencies not recognized by the state – an action recently taken by one of its largest trading partners, Russia.      A spokesperson for the bank said:      ""The main message was that bitcoins are not regulated or supervised by the Lithuanian and European authorities. Users and investors should know that they are not protected and their losses will not be compensated.""              Russia ranks third in overall trade with Lithuania behind the European Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States, of which Russia is a member.    Following Europe's lead  [post-quote]  Perhaps most notable for the countries bitcoin users is that the Bank of Lithuania suggest that, while it is monitoring other nations, Russia and China were not cited among those that would have a measurable impact on any eventual decisions.  The bank said: ""We are looking forward for decision of European authorities on the treatment of virtual currencies such as bitcoin.""    For now, however, the bank stated that ""there is no common decision"" about how bitcoin and other virtual currencies should be regulated.      Still, it acknowledged that with no current laws relating to virtual currencies, there maybe a ""need"" for it to give its market legal clarity. A spokesperson for the bank suggested that it has been monitoring bitcoin and other virtual currencies ""for some time"", and that three central concerns regarding bitcoin have emerged:    Lack of regulation  Lack of consumer protection  Possible money laundering activities.    As for any benefits bitcoin could provide to Lithuania's financial ecosystem, the Bank of Lithuania was less straightforward. Rather, the spokesperson indicated that since there has been no official decision on bitcoin, ""it is premature to talk about any benefits"".    Bitcoin use in Lithuania    Currently, Lithuania ranks 46th in terms of total bitcoin users – behind South Africa, but ahead of Kazakhstan, which recently issued a similar warning. However, bitcoin has developed a presence in the country's business community.      For example, FOXBOX accepts bitcoin at its money service terminals, which are now available in more than 90 Lithuanian cities, making it one of the more extensive networks of physical bitcoin kiosks. Further, FOXBOX uses Lithuania-based wallet and exchange provider SpectroCoin to power its services.      Statistics show less than 1 percent of Lithuania's population are bitcoin users. To date, just over 15,000 Lithuanians have downloaded the official Bitcoin-Qt wallet, and despite comments from the bank, interest seems to have been steady, with 10% of all downloads coming since the start of 2014.      At press time, 1 BTC was trading for 1682 Lithuanian litas.

42425422,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7jh,1392059201,Microsoft Updates Bing Search Engine for Bitcoin Currency Conversions,"Microsoft revealed on 10th February that its Bing search engine will now automatically convert currency denominations to BTC in response to simple commands.      These include queries such as ""$13 to BTC"" or ""0.45 BTC to euros,"" which when entered will reveal answers using the most up-to-date price data from San Francisco-based bitcoin wallet provider Coinbase.      The move is notable as it could represent a willingness on the part of Microsoft to embrace bitcoin. Further, the decision could force Google, the world's most popular search engine, to update its own currency converter.    Microsoft moves toward bitcoin    Microsoft, one of the world's largest software companies, has been silent on bitcoin, though its researchers have been studying it for some time.      Notably, the Washington-based company discontinued its own in-house virtual currency system last year. Before its demise, Microsoft Points allowed users to purchase games and media content on products such as Windows Phones and Xbox consoles.      Bing's BTC conversions will first be available in Australia, Canada, India, the United Kingdom and the United States, before debuting in additional markets.    Bill Gates sidesteps bitcoin questions    The announcement occurred on the same day Microsoft co-founder and technology adviser Bill Gates participated in an Ask Me Anything reddit discussion in which he was asked about his thoughts on cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.      The question, submitted by user shiruken, received 1890 points and quickly became the top question.      Gates did answer, but did not weigh in with Microsoft's position on bitcoin. Rather, he reiterated that his nonprofit, the Gates Foundation, believes that 'digital money' services such as Kenya's M-Pesa mobile service will continue to grow, especially in the developing world over the next five years. Gates elaborated:      ""The foundation is involved in digital money, but unlike bitcoin it would not be anonymous digital money.""            Google's next move    The decision by Bing could put pressure on Google, which has been similarly silent on all matters bitcoin, though obtained emails suggest that the company is at least taking a passive interest despite its PR silence.      Some media outlets have speculated it could try to one-up its rival by opening the doors to even more virtual currency conversions. Bing currently supports currency conversions for 50 currencies, however, Google supports a far greater number on its service.

42425411,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7Nh,1392056889,Malware Uses Victims' Machines to Mine Bitcoin Until Ransom is Paid,"A new Trojan has been discovered by Emsisoft, producer of PC security software. This is no garden-variety Trojan, however, it is a curious hybrid of bitcoin-mining malware and ransomware.  Whereas most ransomware directly attacks your PC or encrypts files stored on its drives, 'Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Linkup' blocks internet access by modifying your DNS and turns your computer into a bitcoin-mining bot at the same time.  Luckily, it shouldn’t be hard to spot when your system has been infected. ‘Linkup’ blocks all internet access bar a bogus Council of Europe website, which will demand personal information and a ‘payment method’ (read ‘ransom’) to unblock your access. Needless to say the Council of Europe has absolutely nothing to do with your internet access and you should not pay anything or enter personal details to regain your service.  In addition to messing around with the DNS, Linkup can also link up to a remote server and pressgang your PC into service as a bitcoin-mining bot. This is carried out via a downloader called 'pts2.exe', which extracts a second file, named 'j.exe', onto your computer. This is, in fact, a popular piece of mining software called 'jhProtominer'.  The damage that is likely to be inflicted by the Trojan is limited. jhProtominer only works on 64-bit operating systems, but, even so, that still leaves plenty of computers around the globe to infect.  Malware losing the mining battle  Emsisoft  says it will keep a close eye on Linkup as it evolves. Since it is an unusual mix of ransomware and bitcoin-mining malware, it is in a class of its own. Luckily the company has already come up with a way of detecting Linkup and says that the Trojan should not be too dangerous, provided it does not metamorphose into something more sophisticated.  Bitcoin-mining malware is becoming increasingly common, but developers of these malicious programs are actually fighting a losing battle. As bitcoin's hash difficulty goes up, the mining power achievable with hijacking standard PCs decreases exponentially.  Furthermore, security firms are starting to take notice of the new trend in malware, and just a few weeks ago Microsoft helped destroy the Sefnit botnet, which was also stealing bitcoin mining capacity from people’s PCs. Several other illicit bitcoin mining operations have recently gone the same way.

42375628,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9NjB,1392053723,Australia Will Set Official Tax Guidelines on Bitcoin This Year,"The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has announced that it intends to work bitcoin capital gains and sales tax guidelines into its system for users to declare on tax returns this year. Its US equivalent, the IRS, is said to be investigating a similar implementation.  ATO senior assistant commissioner Michael Hardy provided a statement to the Financial Review's Sunday program on Australian TV, saying the office has been monitoring the development of bitcoin and wondering how to tax such ""new types of payment tokens"". He said:  “The ATO is working on a holistic understanding of the taxation treatment of bitcoin to be in a position to provide certainty for the Australian community.”  Businesses would need to account for bitcoin transactions when calculating Australia's Goods and Services Tax (GST, similar to VAT) by recording the transaction's value in dollars and also determining which other tax or investment rules might apply.  This does not mean the ATO will accept tax payments in bitcoin. But it does show promise that a government is preparing to take bitcoin seriously and include it in its regulatory structure somehow. The current Australian tax year will end on 30th June, with a deadline for returns to be submitted by 31st October.  Other regulation  Australia's main financial regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is also conducting its own analysis of the bitcoin economy.  “Electronic currencies or cryptocurrencies – which include bitcoins – are a developing area globally. Like other regulatory bodies around the world, ASIC is considering whether and how current legislation (such as the Corporations Act) might apply to these arrangements,” said ASIC spokesperson Hilarie Dunn.  The Sunday TV program also gave an introduction to bitcoin and interviewed local startups working with it, including mobile developer Bitscan, and questioned whether bitcoin should be regarded as a commodity or a currency. Australia's Treasury department says it has ""no plans on recognizing it as legal tender at this stage.""  ""Not only is it not going away, it's going to grow,"" one of the Sunday report's interviewees said.  ""In simple terms, it's a currency with value. And it's real, and it has an impact that's real. You can buy a coffee in St Kilda in Melbourne with a bitcoin. You can do business globally with a bitcoin. That's real.""  But how?  Regulators, for all their good or other intentions, still have not indicated how they intend to trace or police bitcoin transactions, given that even in cases of theft and criminal proceeds seizures they have proved difficult to find. This would be a necessary step towards including bitcoin gains in taxable income.  Investments in bitcoin itself could be measured as simple capital gains, if ownership of bitcoins were as easy to track as other commodities or financial instruments.

42425421,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7hh,1392050859,"Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik: Mt. Gox is Wrong, Bitcoin isn't Broken","Bitcoin core developers Jeff Garzik and Gavin Andresen have responded to Mt. Gox's claims that there is a flaw in the Bitcoin software.  Mt. Gox issued a statement this morning (GMT), revealing it had suspended bitcoin withdrawals indefinitely due to a previously known technical issue with its custom wallet implementation of the Bitcoin core protocol.  Garzik stressed that Mt. Gox seems to be attempting to shift the blame for its recent failings onto Bitcoin and its developers.  ""First and foremost, bitcoin is not broken. There is no fundamental flaw in bitcoin,"" said Garzik.    The #bitcoin protocol and network are just fine today. Let's not over-react about a technical issue in one custom implementation.      — Jeff Garzik (@jgarzik) February 10, 2014    He went on to explain that Mt. Gox's issue is with a technical detail called transaction malleability, which has been known about since 2011 and even has its own wiki entry.  The Linux kernel engineer highlighted this point in another tweet this afternoon.  #bitcoin transaction malleability wiki page, https://t.co/ggc76lkyTG Remember kids: zero-confirmation transactions are not secure. — Jeff Garzik (@jgarzik) February 10, 2014  Garzik told CoinDesk: ""There are certain security practices that sites like Mt. Gox need to follow. Most notably, customer support staff and related software must not assume that transaction IDs are unchangeable, prior to being confirmed in the block chain.  ""Confirmation in the block chain is bitcoin's core security mechanism.""  He said it is unlikely that this issue will cause any emergency updates to be made to the core bitcoin software, but it could lead to some websites, such as Mt. Gox, updating their versions of the software.  Garzik commented that it is difficult to make software that people can use and adjust without making errors.  ""Programmers are not immune to missing documented details. And new systems are not immune to rough edges, but we're always on the lookout for ways to remove the sharp edges that people cut themselves on,"" he concluded.    Bitcoin Foundation: Contrary to Mt. Gox’s Statement, Bitcoin is not at fault https://t.co/8vDLCnrqG5 #btcf via @jonmatonis      — Bitcoin Foundation (@BTCFoundation) February 10, 2014    Gavin Andresen, lead developer on The Bitcoin Project, confirmed in a statement on the Bitcoin Foundation's blog that the core development team has been working to limit transaction malleability.  ""There is broad agreement in the community that this needs to be eliminated. Finding the best and most responsible solution will take time. In the meantime, users of the reference implementation do not need to be concerned. Transactions are always tracked properly by the Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind software,"" he explained.

42425424,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7nh,1392048540,CoinDesk Removes Mt. Gox from Bitcoin Price Index,"CoinDesk has removed Mt. Gox from the Bitcoin Price Index today (as of 16:00 GMT), due to its persistent failure to meet the Index’s standards for inclusion.  Ultimately, the decision to remove Mt. Gox from the BPI was prompted by Friday’s announcement that bitcoin (BTC) withdrawals had been suspended until Monday, and today’s follow-up announcement that bitcoin withdrawals would now be suspended indefinitely. This was due to a previously known technical issue with Mt. Gox's custom wallet implementation of the Bitcoin core protocol.  However, these recent withdrawal restrictions are just the latest in a series of issues which have made Mt. Gox’s inclusion in the BPI problematic.  Concerns over Mt. Gox’s price variance  A concern separate from timely customer withdrawals which had recently commanded attention was the expansion of the so-called ‘Mt. Gox premium’.  For example, on 28th January, Mt. Gox customers were paying more than 25% more for bitcoins than customers on BTC-e, another BPI component exchange.  The issue of price dispersion across the many different bitcoin exchanges was part of CoinDesk’s original rationale behind the Bitcoin Price Index, and some ongoing dispersion is to be expected for reasons ranging from differences in bitcoin regulation across the globe to the overall maturity of the exchange market for bitcoins.  However, the price dispersion between two other BPI components, Bitstamp and BTC-e, has recently remained in the low single-digit percent range, raising concerns over whether bitcoin prices quoted on Gox were representative of the overall market.  Concerns over excessive price dispersion at Mt. Gox, however, have since subsided as the Gox premium compressed into single percentage digits since 28th January.  Customers' love-hate relationship with Mt. Gox  Complaints over withdrawal delays at Mt. Gox are nothing new, having dogged the exchange since the first-half of 2013, when Mt. Gox first ran afoul with US regulators after its failure to register as a money transmitter.  Throughout the first-half of 2013, Mt. Gox commanded a very high share of bitcoin trading volume, leaving many feeling that, in spite of its withdrawal issues, Mt. Gox was still a viable option given the available alternatives.  However, as the year progressed Mt. Gox’s market share in total bitcoin trading volume steadily eroded, and in late-2013 Mt. Gox was eclipsed as the number one Bitcoin exchange, first by BTC-China and then Bitstamp.  Mt. Gox’s persistent withdrawal problems  Reports of Mt. Gox customer withdrawal problems have been rising of late and these complaints have not fallen on deaf ears at CoinDesk.  CoinDesk has been working diligently to independently verify complaints. We recently ran an open poll about Mt. Gox to gather additional details from customers, and a number of Mt. Gox customers have shared their experiences with CoinDesk in confidence.  One recent high-profile example was a Mt. Gox customer who flew to Tokyo to protest outside Gox’s offices over withdrawal delays, alas to no avail.  Importance of timely customer withdrawals  The ability of exchange customers to obtain timely withdrawals is a criterion of the Bitcoin Price Index. Specifically, point 6 in the BPI criteria states:  “Banking and/or bitcoin transfers in or out of the exchange must be completed within seven business days, if deposit and withdrawal methods are not offered for various countries and/or currencies.”  Mt. Gox has been unable to consistently meet this criterion. Also of concern has been Mt. Gox’s failure to provide a sufficiently credible explanation for why the problem is occurring, or a detailed plan/timeline for when the problem of timely customer withdrawals will be resolved.  An exchange's ability to execute timely customer withdrawals is an important BPI criterion for several reasons.  If timely customer withdrawals are not possible then this could have an influence on the accuracy of the exchange’s price discovery mechanism. For example, customers of Mt. Gox were often thought to be trading bitcoins at rates beyond their value on other exchanges so that they could more easily transfer BTC out of the exchange. In recent days the reverse has occurred, with the 'Mt. Gox Premium' becoming a discount during certain periods.  Customer withdrawal delays may be a symptom of other serious problems at the exchange which are difficult to independently verify, such as internal technical issues, legal/regulatory inquiries, or the exchange's solvency.  CoinDesk has removed Mt. Gox from the calculation of the Bitcoin Price Index effective today at 16:00 GMT.  About the Bitcoin Price Index  Launched in September 2013  , the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index represents an average of bitcoin prices across leading global exchanges that meet criteria specified by CoinDesk.  The BPI is intended to serve as a standard retail price reference for industry participants and accounting professionals.  The CoinDesk BPI is a professionally curated index with a combination of quantitative and qualitative data points under consideration. Selective criteria such as price volatility, inconsistencies in processing withdrawals, and standard deviation from the mean all play a factor in exchange inclusion.  CoinDesk’s goal is to include all exchanges which meet the BPI criteria in the Price Index so that the Index provides the most accurate, representative real-time measure of bitcoin’s price.  Have any feedback on the BPI criteria? Are there other exchanges beyond Bitstamp and BTC-e which should be included? Please share your thoughts and opinions in the comments.

42422943,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yn1h,1392041356,Doge's Dinner: East London Burger Stall Accepts Dogecoin,"East London’s Brick Lane is a favourite destination for tourists seeking some of the area’s storied urban grit and cutting-edge fashions.  The Sunday Up Market, housed in part of the Old Truman Brewery complex, is where visitors can go to grab a bite from the cosmopolitan array of stalls – food from Mexico, Japan, Argentina and plenty more. But a new vendor is offering something that sets it apart even at the Upmarket: steamed burgers that customers can buy with dogecoin.  The vendor is BIT Bourbon Steam Burgers, and its been open for two Sundays. Its owner, Oliver Rynkiewicz, contends that his burgers taste better because the beef patties are cooked in a steam oven instead of on a grill. The burgers are steamed in a bourbon and spice-laced concoction, that Rynkiewicz claims greatly enhances their flavour.  “The water is infused with bourbon, rosemary and other spices. This keeps the burger moist, it’s less fatty but it’s still juicy,” he said.  It seems London's dogecoiners have taken in interest. Rynkiewicz said he has had three customers pay with the dog-based digital currency and one customer settle the bill with the more conventional cryptocurrency, bitcoin. Rynkiewicz’s steamed burgers start at £5.50 for a basic cheeseburger.  Rynkiewicz said he has collected about 18,000 dogecoin from customers to date. He said he plans to keep any digital currency he receives as an investment. He was first introduced to digital currencies by his brother, a web designer. He said:  “My elder brother is really into bitcoin and dogecoin, so I was thinking, why not start accepting it? It’s good for marketing as well. I really believe in dogecoin and I think it will go to the moon.”  As CoinDesk was sampling Rynkiewicz’s wares, one bitcoin enthusiast happened to walk by, remarking on the stall’s signboard which read: Double Bit Burger, Much Meat, Very Tasty!’. The passerby, Cais Manai, couldn’t part with his digital currency for a burger because he didn’t have a mobile wallet.  “I’ve only got my bitcoins on my computer at home. I’ve got an ASIC miner. This is cool, though,” Manai said.  Man v Food  Rynkiewicz, 22, was inspired to start his steamed burger stall by an episode of the television series ‘Man V Food’. The show follows host Adam Richman’s travels around the United States as he consumes vast quantities of apparently delicious food:  “I’m not a huge fan of the show, but I was just bored at home and happened to watch this episode where [Richman] went to Connecticut to eat this steamed burger. I was considering a few other dishes, like pulled pork, as well.”  Rynkiewicz is juggling a full-time job as a bartender at a five-star London hotel with running his burger stall with his partner on the weekend. He hopes to get enough business from his burger venture to quit his day job and open several more stalls around London. He said he moved to London a year ago from Sunderland where he worked as a tattoo artist.  “I work Monday to Friday [at the hotel] and then Saturday is our prep day for the stall. Then I wake up at seven to start business here,” he said.  Rynkiewicz’s burger stall isn’t the first vendor to accept digital currencies in east London. CoinDesk previously reported on Burger Bear, a gourmet burger stall in Shoreditch that was the first to accept bitcoin.

42425412,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7Ph,1392036322,'CoinThief' Mac Malware Steals Bitcoins From Your Wallet,"UPDATE (12th February, 11:35 GMT): SecureMac reports the bitcoin-stealing malware has spread to popular download sites like Download.com and MacUpdate, under several different names. If you think your machine could be infected, take a screenshot of the instructions here and disconnect from the internet immediately.  A Mac OS X trojan horse masquerading as a private bitcoin wallet app is responsible for ""multiple"" bitcoin thefts, according to Mac security researchers.  SecureMac  , a Mac security consultancy that develops the MacScan anti-malware application and blogs about its research, released a report today warning of 'CoinThief.A'.  Hidden within the open-source OS X bitcoin wallet app StealthBit, CoinThief.A monitors users' web traffic to steal login credentials for software wallets and popular bitcoin sites, including BTC-e, Mt. Gox, and Blockchain.info.  The StealthBit app had been available on GitHub both as source code and a precompiled download, but the page has now been removedhttps://github.com/thomasrevor/StealthBit.  Update: Versions of the malware have been found with numerous different names on other popular software download sites, such as Download.com and MacUpdate.com. BitVanity and StealthBit were distributed on Github, while Bitcoin Ticker TTM and Litecoin Ticker were distributed on Download.com and MacUpdate.com. It seems both app names were copied from legitimate apps in the Mac App Store, but the malicious payload was not found in the official Mac App Store copies of these apps.  Mismatched code  Suspicion arose when investigators discovered the precompiled version did not match the source (which more knowledgeable users could examine for themselves and needed to compile before using). The precompiled version contained the malware, whereas the open-source code did not.  The report said:    ""Upon running the program for the first time, the malware installs browser extensions for Safari and the Google Chrome web browser, without alerting the user. The web browsers are tricked into thinking that the user intentionally installed the extensions, and give no warning to the user that all of their web browsing traffic is now being monitored by the malicious extensions.      Additionally, the malware installs a program that continually runs in the background, looking for bitcoin wallet login credentials, which are then sent back to a remote server.""    The browser extensions had innocuous sounding names like 'Pop-up Blocker' to avoid detection. Once installed, the trojan also searches the system for anti-malware software and logs unique identifiers (UUIDs) for each infected machine.  Large thefts  At least one Bitcoin Talk Forum user reported a whopping 20BTC theft after installing StealthBit, which was also posted on reddit.  Other investigators noted several similarities between StealthBit and Bitvanity, another piece of notorious Mac malware that stole users' bitcoins last August. Bitvanity posed as a vanity wallet address generator that harvested addresses and private keys from software like the Bitcoin-Qt client.  StealthBit's GitHub code repository was stored under the username 'thomasrevor' and a reddit user named 'trevorscool' posted an announcement about its development there on 2nd February. Last year, Bitvanity's GitHub code was posted under the name 'trevory'.  As reported previously on CoinDesk, there are rich rewards for malware and ransomware developers trading in bitcoin thanks to its mostly unregulated and difficult-to-trace nature. Accomplices can be paid, and ransoms collected from anywhere in the world.  Open-source security  The discovery has highlighted the benefits (and issues) that surround open-source software. While the malware was not contained in the open-source version of the code, less able or impatient users may still have trusted the precompiled version on GitHub and installed without a second thought.  The 'clean' open-source version, however, allowed programmers to find a discrepancy between the two versions within days of its appearance, leading to speedy warnings of the malware and, hopefully, fewer infections.

42425423,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7lh,1392030347,Price Drops as Mt. Gox Blames Bitcoin Flaw for Withdrawal Delays,"Mt. Gox has issued a statement in an effort to address concerns raised by users after it suspended bitcoin withdrawals late last week. The exchange insists it is working hard to address a technical issue that has made it impossible for users to make transfers.  The company also points out that currency withdrawals and transfers to any Mt. Gox address are not affected by the issue.  Mt. Gox stressed that the problem is not limited to its exchange – it affects all transactions where bitcoins are sent to a third party. Once the problem was identified, Mt. Gox chose to suspend bitcoin withdrawals until it can be resolved.  Geeky and non-geeky explanation  Mt. Gox offered two explanations for laymen and tech-savvy users. In essence, Mt. Gox says it identified a bug in the Bitcoin software that makes it possible for someone to use the network to alter transaction details, making it seem like bitcoins had not been sent to a bitcoin wallet, when in fact they had.  “Since the transaction appears as if it has not proceeded correctly, the bitcoins may be re-sent. Mt. Gox is working with the Bitcoin core development team and others to mitigate this issue,” Mt. Gox said.  The technical explanation is a lot more detailed.  It points out that bitcoin transactions are subject to a design flaw that has been largely ingored, although it was known to “at least a part” of the Bitcoin core development community. The defect is known as “transaction malleability” and it allows third parties to alter the hash of a fresh transaction without invalidating the signature. Mt. Gox explains:  “Of course only one of the two transactions can be validated. However, if the party who altered the transaction is fast enough, for example with a direct connection to different mining pools, or has even a small amount of mining power, it can easily cause the transaction hash alteration to be committed to the blockchain.""  The “sendtoaddress” API returns a transaction hash as a way to track the insertion of the transaction into the block chain. Since most wallet and exchange services keep a record of this in order to respond to users who make inquiries about their transactions, they could assume that the transaction was not sent – as it would not appear in the block chain with the original hash. For the time being, there is no way of efficiently recognizing alternative transactions.  “This means that an individual could request bitcoins from an exchange or wallet service, alter the resulting transaction's hash before inclusion in the blockchain, then contact the issuing service while claiming the transaction did not proceed. If the alteration fails, the user can simply send the bitcoins back and try again until successful.”  Working on a fix  Mt. Gox believes the problem can be addressed by using a different hash for transaction tracking purposes. The network would continue to employ the current hash for the purpose of including the transaction in each block’s Merkle Tree, while the new hash would be used to track transactions and it could be computed and indexed by hashing the exact signed string via SHA 256, the same way transactions are hashed.  “This new transaction hash will allow signing parties to keep track of any transaction they have signed and can easily be computed, even for past transactions,” Mt. Gox said. “We have discussed this solution with the Bitcoin core developers and will allow bitcoin withdrawals again once it has been approved and standardized.”  In the meantime Mt. Gox is urging exchanges and wallet services, as well as any other service that sends bitcoins directly to third parties, to be “extremely careful” with anyone claiming their transaction did not go through. The issue also affects altcoins using the same transaction scheme as Bitcoin.  The exchange says it will try to resume withdrawals as soon as possible:  “Mt. Gox will resume bitcoin withdrawals to outside wallets once the issue outlined above has been properly addressed in a manner that will best serve our customers.”  Mt. Gox also noted that more information on the status of the issue will be released as soon as it is available – but for now users will not be able to make bitcoin withdrawals. The fix can't come soon enough, as the problems have caused a selling frenzy in some circles.  Price fall  Since the announcement was published, the price of bitcoin has witnessed a steep decline. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index shows a sharp fall from $681 at 10:00 (GMT) to $572 at the time of writing.  The last time the price dropped to this level was on December 19th, shortly after China's central bank met with third-party payment companies and banned them from doing business with bitcoin exchanges.  This news caused bitcoiners across the globe to panic sell their collections of the digital currency, but the price drop didn't last for long – it increased to $770 by the end of the year.  Responses  Responses to the Mt. Gox statement have been largely negative. Oleg Andreev, a software developer and bitcoin enthusiast, said on Twitter:    @bitcoin_bolsa @bodskibod it’s a bug in their handling of payments, not in Bitcoin.      — Oleg Andreev (@oleganza) February 10, 2014    Liad Shababo, founder of Shoply.com, was also pretty annoyed at Mt. Gox's statement:    @oleganza they spin it like its a fault in the protocol rather than a fault in their understanding. dirty of them.      — Liad Shababo (@L1AD) February 10, 2014    Redditors also panned Mt. Gox's explanation. One of the top comments on the post noted that the transaction malleability issue had been known for at least a year. One commenter, nomailing, posted:  It has nothing to do with the protocol. It's just incompetence of the [Mt. Gox] developers. It's their fault to rely on transaction hashes although transaction malleability is nothing new.  BTC-e got in touch with CoinDesk and had this to say:  ""There is not a problem with the Bitcoin's protocol. Unconfirmed transactions were always malleable in the Bitcoin network. We wonder why Mt. Gox wasn't already aware about this having worked for several years with the protocol. We kindly advise Mt. Gox to hire more professional technical staff.""  What do you think of Mt. Gox's statement?

42425417,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7Xh,1392030010,Money2020 'Bitcoin World' Brings Bitcoin and Finance Leaders Together,"Money2020  , an annual financial innovation summit held in Las Vegas, is adding a bitcoin track to its agenda this year.  Titled 'Bitcoin World at Money2020’, the cryptocurrency portion of the event will feature angel investor Roger Ver, Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and Blockchain.info CEO Nicolas Cary as speakers.  The organizers of the conference want Bitcoin World to bring the mainstream financial industry up to speed with cryptocurrencies. Anil D Aggarwal, co-founder of Money2020, told CoinDesk:  “We’re going to get 5,000 to 6,000 people. Over 500 CEOs, people from 2,000 companies and 50 countries. We have become the largest event globally for innovations in money.”  Aggarwal explained that Money2020 is all about financial technologies, so it seemed a natural step for the conference to start offering a cryptocurrency component.  “We are creating Bitcoin World at Money2020 because we’re big believers in cryptocurrencies. We believe in the notion of a decentralized ledger.”  Getting banks on board  The organizers believe Money2020 could provide an excellent networking opportunity for bitcoin-related businesses as well as financial companies.  For the most part, bitcoin companies already know one another other well, due to the industry's nascent nature. As a result, the biggest value for many growing cryptocurrency businesses at Money2020's event will be to meet more traditional financial players.  Banking stands out as a sector that needs to interface with the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry better. Banking and bitcoin are in a precarious position in relation to one another. Aggarwal said:  “The individuals that attend from these banks are the individuals that are generally responsible for innovation within the banks and figuring out where they take their organization.”  “There’s no doubt they’ve got to at least address this issue of what they do with bitcoin,” he added.  Education and content  Aggarwal believes that Money2020’s Bitcoin World is going to have to provide very fundamental cryptocurrency education for its attendees. “We think that you need to start at a 101,” he said, regarding getting attendees up to speed on the subject.  “We really need to parse through what is bitcoin, what is the right way to evaluate it. We think that the conversation needs to start at that very basic level.”  Because the conference is scheduled for November, organizers are taking a cautious approach to what will be relevant for their event at that point in time.  While Money2020 has many of its Bitcoin World speakers already lined up, specific panel topics will be ironed out later in the year.  Providing a broad framework that tells the real story of bitcoin is going to be important at the event, and it will be imperative to make that judgement call later in the year.  “We think that a lot of the stories that are out there around bitcoin [are] not the reality, it’s not well understood. We want to make sure it’s well understood because we believe the more it’s understood, the more [willing] the mainstream ecosystem [will be] to work with it,” said Aggarwal.  Behind Money2020  Anil Aggarwal, co-founder of Money2020, has vast experience in the financial technology industry. He was previously a fintech CEO for 15 years, and sold his last company to Google for $210m.  Prior to founding Money2020, Aggarwal was working on business development for Google Wallet.  “I started Money2020 because I felt that our industry really needed to come together around innovations in money. And that wasn’t happening.”  And unlike many events that are organized by companies that specialize in conferences, Money2020's creation and planning comes from financial industry insiders.  “We’re a very unusual event. We didn’t come from an event company. We were really operators in the industry putting something together to bring the ecosystem together in new and important ways,” said Aggarwal.  This is the third year of the Money2020. In its first year, it garnered 1,200 attendees. Last year, there were 4,200. The organizers are forecasting 6,000 people this year, and have not yet decided whether or not they will cap it at that particular number.  Bitcoin payments at Money2020  Simran Aggarwal, the president of Money2020, says that the event is also trying to incorporate bitcoin transactions into the symposium itself. That's why they are accepting bitcoin payments for conference sponsorships and registration.  Many vendors will also be accepting bitcoin, and possibly at the hotel that the event will be held at too. She said: “We’re talking with the Aria about the hotel taking bitcoin.”  “We’re not only believers, we’re followers. We practice what we believe in. Last year we gave our team bonuses in bitcoin. We’re having a lot of fun with it,” she said.  Money2020, along with its Bitcoin World track, will be held 2nd - 6th November at the Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. Registration for the event is open now.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/10/money2020-bitcoin-world-brings-bitcoin-and-finance-leaders-together,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a0e0ee5faefd3ccbd0c5bf0601b107028c59cdf1-1012x703.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425414,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7Th,1392026121,Reserve Bank of India Pressed for Clarification on Virtual Currency,"Indian bitcoin enthusiast Venugopal Badaravada has pressed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for clarification after the regulatory body issued a virtual currency warning on 24th December 2013.  Cyber law consultant, Na ‘Naavi’ Vijayashankar, who is based in Bangalore, made the representation to the RBI on behalf of Badaravada.  “What we have [said to] the RBI is that they cannot leave the question of acceptance of bitcoin hanging. Whether the RBI agrees to accept it, or they are opposed to the concept of bitcoins, is something they need to clarify,” Vijayashankar said.  The December advisory cautioned citizens on the volatility of all virtual currencies and alluded to the legitimacy of bitcoin. The final paragraph of the notice read:  “The Reserve Bank has also stated that it is presently examining the issues associated with the usage, holding and trading of virtual currencies under the extant legal and regulatory framework of the country, including Foreign Exchange and Payment Systems laws and regulations.”  Vijayashankar filed the representation on 7th January to seek clarification on the legal status of bitcoin in the country. He has not heard back within the statutory 30-day period, he said.  “They won’t come up with a clarification unless they are forced to. I was not actually expecting them to give response,” admitted Vijayashankar on 7th February, the deadline for the RBI reply.  The next step is to appeal to a higher level of judiciary in the effort to press the RBI for a clear-cut stand on virtual currency, he said. The courts are likely to give some more time to the RBI to formulate a response.  Vijayashankar expects this process to drag on for several months. In the meantime, the uncertainty around bitcoin is adversely affecting the popularity of the digital currency in India.  “Remaining silent, they are not allowing the industry to invest and go ahead with the business, or seek any further clarifications from a higher court,” said Vijayashankar.  Putting the brakes on  Following the notice in December, not only were bitcoin exchanges shut down – some only temporarily – but new users grew wary of using bitcoin.  George Jacob is a consultant for weRwired, a geospatial, security and entertainment consulting company based in Bangalore. He is one of four merchants in the area that are ready and willing to accept bitcoin.  Jacob almost received his first cryptocurrency payment from a client last month, but they decided to pay him in fiat currency instead, after the RBI’s off-putting announcement. Jacob said:  “The last job we did was for a very tech-savvy person. We did a massive security set up for him. He was quite keen on doing a bitcoin payment. After this whole RBI thing that happened in December, he got a bit concerned. He decided to pay us the regular bank transfer way, but otherwise that would have been our first bitcoin payment.”  Potential for regulation  Whether RBI has the authority to regulate bitcoin is also being actively discussed. Lawyer Vipul Kharbanda wrote a paper claiming it would be tricky for the Indian government to ban bitcoin.  He makes the case that, because bitcoin does not fit the “vanilla” definitions of currency or securities in India, the RBI or the Securities and Exchange Board of India cannot regulate it.  “However, there is a potential of it being regulated by the RBI or the Securities and Exchange Board because they do have the power to notify it as a security or a currency,” said Kharbanda.  While many members of the Indian bitcoin community are waiting for RBI’s next move, bitcoin entrepreneur and organiser of the Bangalore Bitcoin Creativity Crew, Benson Samuel, says that these efforts may be misplaced.  “I can’t really see what an answer would be because we all know this is a technology that can’t really be controlled, monitored or regulated,” said Samuel. He added:  “They are better off looking at other aspects of it like its end usage. Don’t make too much of a fanfare about it. Treat it like cash.”  Vijayashankar said he is likely to take the claim for clarification to the higher courts early next week (commencing 10th February).

42425419,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7fh,1392007525,Bitsavings Promises 5% Interest on Bitcoin Deposits – Too Good to be True?,"A bitcoin deposit service called Bitsavings is offering returns of 5% a month to anyone bold enough to put their savings there.  Users should be advised though, that several such schemes have made promises in the bitcoin world before, and if it sounds too good to be true, it often is.  Despite the name, Bitsavings is not attempting to be a bitcoin bank and seems to be offering users worldwide a chance to buy into its trading scheme, which it says is ""working fine thus far"".  The company, whose site went live 60 days ago, is based out of Panama according to a spokesman. Terms and conditions listed on the site state it is subject to the laws of Romania. The deposit address listed on the site, however, had recorded no activity and had a 0 BTC balance at the time of writing.  Update: The company says it changes deposit/withdrawal addresses very regularly ""to ensure the safety of customers' funds"", hence the zero balances.  Arbitrage and hedging  The spokesman went on to explain how Bitsavings made such returns possible, and indeed guaranteed.  ""We are offering 5% interest by taking advantage of market volatility and ensuring that we are properly investing all BTC deposits in a way that always earns us a minimum of 5%/monthly (arbitrage techniques, large-scale automated trading to hedge against losses, among others)"" he said.  Bitsavings' operators claim the 5% return is guaranteed to users whether the trading system succeeds or not, saying the company itself will wear all risk.  ""We also have pledged to back any losses with our own funds if needed (though we don't envision that being necessary; with that being said though, you never know and we can't be too careful).""  Skepticism  The company's promises have met with skepticism from the community, with some questioning how a commodity with a slowing generation rate like bitcoin could promise 5% returns. Given past experiences with other bitcoin investment schemes promising tantalizing returns, and the mostly unregulated playing field, this is probably not surprising.  Bitsavings' withdrawal request process is also slightly unorthodox: Anyone wishing to withdraw funds should, according to the site's instructions, send 0.001 BTC multiplied by the amount they want to withdraw as a fee to automatically trigger the transfer. For example, a depositor with 100 BTC wishing to withdraw 60 BTC would send 0.06 BTC to the address supplied.  Bitcoin interest  A site called Bitdeposit.net sprang up with little fanfare around July last year, offering a 5.3% return after one year to anyone who sent bitcoins. It now appears to be offline, though, and the bitcoin address it published for users to deposit funds has seen few transactions, with no deposits since November 2013.  A Texas man named Trendon T. Shavers promised a more generous 7% per week to depositors through his Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BTCST) business last year, also via arbitrage activity. He raised 700,000 BTC (worth $64m at the time and over $490m today) before being arrested in July for fraud, accused of operating a Ponzi scheme.  Bitsavings' operators say they have been around the bitcoin community for a few years now, starting with mining their own coins. The team have backgrounds in web development, programming, and venture capital.
