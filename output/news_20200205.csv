42431493,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2xRh,1580938729,Telegram Drops Technical White Paper for Blockchain SEC Is Trying to Halt,"Telegram, the messaging app company currently facing a legal fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over its $1.7 billion token sale, revealed more details about the technical specifications underpinning its TON blockchain Wednesday.      A new white paper details the block validation process for its blockchain, describing it as a Byzantine Fault Tolerant protocol custom-built for proof-of-stake networks. The company was sued by the SEC last year on allegations it sold unregistered securities during the pre-sale of its upcoming gram tokens, the native cryptocurrency for TON. However, this litigation does not appear to be halting any development on the TON platform.      Developers, led by the TON Labs startup, have been kicking the testnet's tires since last spring. The new consensus protocol white paper will give these individuals ‚Äúa formalized understanding¬†of what they‚Äôve been testing,‚Äù TON Labs‚Äô Mitja Goroshevsky told CoinDesk.      ‚ÄúConsensus protocol is a central part of any blockchain and it needs to be described for the further analysis of the blockchain and its code,‚Äù Goroshevsky said.      The paper was previously planned for release in October, when the network was originally scheduled to go live, until the SEC's litigation disrupted the process.      ‚ÄúThe protocol hasn‚Äôt changed since then,‚Äù he said.    Test results    The protocol was tested in December 2018 on ‚Äúup to 300 nodes distributed all over the world,‚Äù according to the white paper. The testing apparently showed that ‚Äúthe TON Blockchain is able to generate new blocks once every four to five seconds, as originally planned.""      According to the explainer TON Labs released, Catchain is a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) partly similar to those used by Tendermint (Cosmos), Algorand, Ouroboros and Casper.      In Catchain, each round attempt includes three steps: validator nodes exchange block candidates for approval; the primary node for the current attempt sends the candidate block for voting to the rest of nodes; then validator nodes exchange votes.      If the validators fail to come to consensus, the ‚Äúround is skipped and the new block is not committed to the blockchain,‚Äù TON Labs‚Äô explainer said. ‚ÄúIf validators fail to reach consensus for a few rounds, new validator election can resolve the deadlock.‚Äù      In its arguments filed with the court, the SEC has argued Telegram didn‚Äôt create a viable blockchain, as it promised to do. While aspiring to outperform bitcoin and ethereum, ‚ÄúTelegram has presented no concrete evidence that it has achieved that goal"" providing merely a ""vague, conclusory statement"" the blockchain is ""fully functional and ready to be launched,‚Äù the agency insisted.      Telegram fought these allegations as irrelevant, saying, ‚ÄúIt is the SEC‚Äôs burden to prove that Grams will be securities, not Defendants‚Äô burden to prove their technology works.‚Äù      The TON testnet has been in beta testing since March 2018. The company released code for TON nodes in September and called for investors to generate their wallets.",NEUTRAL,TON,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | TON,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/05/telegram-drops-technical-white-paper-for-blockchain-sec-is-trying-to-halt,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9d0e47a6c9cd0f1c5d71552848c2628aed1b243-2560x1634.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431499,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2xlh,1580932372,Exchange Deposits in Bitcoin Slide to Lowest Level in 3 Years,"The number of bitcoin on-chain deposits has dropped sharply over the last six months, indicating a strong optimistic or ‚ÄúHODLing,‚Äù sentiment in the market.       The seven-day average of the number of transfers to exchange addresses, or unique daily exchange deposits, fell to 23,986 on Jan. 1. That‚Äôs the lowest level since November 2016 and comes after topping out at 58,925 at the end of June 2019, according to crypto analytics firm Glassnode. The number has since inched up to 27,289 as of Feb. 4.       Notably, the count of deposits dropped by 60 percent in the second half of 2019 even as prices collapsed from $13,800 to $6,425.       During violent price drops, investors usually move their coins to exchanges to sell them in the market. However, investors held onto their coins during the second half of 2019 despite the price slide.       It indicates increased ‚ÄúHODLing,‚Äù a sign of strengthening belief in the long-term viability of the cryptocurrency, according to Ashish Singhal, CEO and co-founder at CRUXPay and CoinSwitch.co.       ‚ÄúHODLers are not in it for a ‚Äòget rich quick‚Äô mentality and are now less fazed by micro factors that previously led to an exodus or panic sell,‚Äù Singhal told CoinDesk.       Nicholas Pelecanos, advisor to NEM Ventures, sees the slowdown in trading and on-chain transaction volumes as indicative of a not-so-healthy market in the short-term.       ‚ÄúA divergence between on-chain transaction volume and price appreciation has typically been a bearish signal,‚Äù Pelecanos told CoinDesk.       Bitcoin‚Äôs price rallied by 30 percent in January, diverging higher from the the count of transfers to exchange addresses, which remained near multi-year lows hit on Jan. 1.       Although the number of transfers to exchanges declined, the number of transactions recently saw an upswing along with price. The seven-day average of transactions jumped rose from 290,200 on Jan. 6 to a three-month high of 324,745 on Feb. 3.       That investors hoarded coins in January amid a price rally suggests strong bullish sentiment among investors; if they had doubted the sustainability of the recent price gains, they would have moved their coins to exchanges to sell them at market price, leading to a rise in exchange deposits.     Exchange deposits may rise after halving    Bitcoin will undergo mining reward halving in May 2020. The process aims to curb inflation by reducing rewards per block mined by 50 percent. When it occurs, the block rewards will drop to 6.25 BTC from the current 12.5 BTC.       Bitcoin has picked up a bid ahead of the supply-cutting event. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $9,400, representing a 46 percent gain on December‚Äôs low of $6,425.       Connor Abendschein, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data, expects exchange deposits to rise should the price of the cryptocurrency continue to do so ahead of the halving and in the following months.

42431490,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2xTh,1580929813,How the Long Tail of the Coronavirus Might Slow Bitcoin's Hash Power Growth,"The coronavirus outbreak in China may impose a longer-term impact on the bitcoin network‚Äôs mining activity at a time when an estimated 65 percent of its computing power is located there.      While Chinese miner manufacturers see rising demand for new equipment ahead of bitcoin‚Äôs scheduled halving in May, they estimate the disease may limit growth in bitcoin mining power if the situation isn‚Äôt resolved in the near future because it is difficult to expand or build new machines, according to Kevin Shao, general manager of Canaan Creative's blockchain arm.      Shao told CoinDesk that while there is little doubt miners can maintain the current level of computing power, there is a shortage of new mining machines.      So far, almost every bitcoin miner maker in China ‚Äì Bitmain, Canaan, MicroBT and InnoSilicon ‚Äì faces delays in production and delivery. Bitmain and Canaan, the world‚Äôs top two miner makers by market share, have published notices saying the delay of after-sale services until Feb. 10.      Customers want new, top-of-the-line mining models to expand existing mining facilities and replace older machines in anticipation of the bitcoin halving, currently expected to occur sometime in May 2020.      ‚ÄúOne of the most affected businesses is our mining machine production,‚Äù Abe Yang, chief operating officer at PandaMiner, told CoinDesk.      Founded in 2013, the Shenzhen-based firm makes mining machines and provides computing power services with nine mining farms.      ‚ÄúNot only us, most miner makers have been affected by the outbreak since their factories are based in cities like Dongguan and Shenzhen in Guangdong province,‚Äù Yang said. ‚ÄúDuring the extended vacation until Feb.10, almost all the production will be halted.‚Äù      Meanwhile, the lockdown of the city of Wuhan has had a more direct impact on InnoSilicon, whose headquarters is located in the outbreak‚Äôs epicenter.      ‚ÄúThe delay currently has not affected our businesses that much since the extension [of the holiday break] will only be several days,‚Äù Shao said. ‚ÄúHowever, the impact could be much more significant if the outbreak continues for a longer period of time.‚Äù      According to data from BTC.com, bitcoin‚Äôs mining difficulty ‚Äì a measure of how hard it is to compete for mining rewards on the bitcoin network ‚Äì¬†posted 6.57 percent and 7.08 percent growth on Jan. 2 and Jan. 15, respectively.      The growth rate dropped to 4.67 percent on Jan. 28 and is estimated to decline to 3 percent in about three days. Bitcoin‚Äôs mining difficulty adjusts itself about every 14 days ‚Äì it goes up or down in positive correlation to whether there are more or less participants racing on the network.      ‚ÄúThe coronavirus outbreak timespan overlaps with bitcoin‚Äôs halving event. The dual factors are apparently affecting the maintenance of mining equipment as well as the delivery of new miners,‚Äù Wang Xin, marketing director of WhatsMiner maker MicroBT said in an interview. ‚ÄúAs such, the recovery of bitcoin‚Äôs hash rate growth will be delayed.‚Äù    Rising demand    Hash power has more than doubled from around 50 EH/s compared to the same period of last year as bitcoin‚Äôs market price climbed over $9,000, according to Shao.      ‚ÄúSecond-hand miners [mostly older models like Bitmain‚Äôs AntMiner S9] that are aiming at a faster payback period, now have a larger risk as they enter a shutdown period ahead of the halving, compared to more powerful new models [like WhatsMiner M20 or AntMiner S17],‚Äù said MicroBT‚Äôs Wang.      Based on f2pool‚Äôs profitability index, models like the most widely used AntMiner S9 would have a 30 percent gross margin at bitcoin‚Äôs current price with an electricity cost of $0.05 per kWh.      However, a lower number of new miners could be good news for those that have already invested in mining equipment with facilities up and running.      Existing miners could see more steady mining rewards because there wouldn‚Äôt be more competitors to enter the market due to the lack of new mining machines, Canaan‚Äôs Shao said.      But he added that one way the outbreak would affect existing miners is that many mining machine providers might not be able to offer timely post-sale services to fix malfunctioned devices.    Logistics issues    Wang said assembly factories have delayed their return-to-business schedule, citing the Chinese government's extension of the Lunar New Year. Businesses in the country have been ordered shut until at least Feb. 10.      This is not a crypto-specific issue either. Reuters reported Monday iPhone sales may take a hit because of the coronavirus, if the health emergency can not be contained in the near future.      Shao said one of his company‚Äôs concerns is slowing logistics, adding, ‚Äúwhile we can make all the plans to prepare for the outbreak on our part, logistics is something we can‚Äôt control.‚Äù      Local infrastructure now prioritizes distributing necessities and supplies to those who are affected by the virus over less important deliveries, Shao said.      Therefore, some of the customers who pre-ordered miners might not be able to receive the machines on time, and it will take longer to deliver new orders if the outbreak continues, Shao said.      Even if employees all return to work, they cannot assemble miners unless their suppliers provide the necessary parts.      ‚ÄúIf the supplies can not be delivered on time, miner makers are not going to be able to assemble the production,‚Äù Shao said.      One way companies can take advantage of their inventory is to run the machines themselves to offer computing power to their clients without selling the actual machines, Yang said. This assumes they have the necessary parts to complete assembling miners.      ‚ÄúHowever, the service is not sustainable if the outbreak continues because we would eventually reach full capacity without new machines, creating a shortage in computing power,‚Äù Yang said.    Mining farms    Mining farms remain unaffected for the moment, but existing quarantine controls and the possibility of an extended outbreak may soon take a toll.      Yang said PandaMiner is able to maintain operations for its existing farms, but there will be significant delays in constructing new farms.      Two-thirds of the company‚Äôs employees did not go home for the Chinese New Year, and have instead been working at the mining sites. However, for those who did go home it will take weeks to return to work, Yang said.      Many cities now require a two-week quarantine for people coming back from other areas before letting them go back to work, he said.      For example, the Xinjiang autonomous region, an area that hosts a significant portion of mining farms due to its cheap electricity, has implemented strict policies to quarantine not only those coming back from the Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, but also any other province or region, Yang said.      ‚ÄúWe asked our employees to come back to Xinjiang as early as possible so that they can start the two-week quarantine and go back to work,‚Äù Yang said, noting policies may vary among different areas in China.      The company‚Äôs mining farm in Guizhou is subject to a stricter policy. ‚ÄúWe are allowed to let our employees work on site and can only keep a few people to maintain the operation,‚Äù he said.      Sichuan province, which controls over 50 percent of bitcoin‚Äôs hashrate, also requires the two-week quarantine, according to Yang.      The lack of on-site staff has already negatively impacted the management of mining farms, Yang said.      Employees are responsible for ensuring mining machines are connected to the Internet and have a consistent supply of power. The employees would also need to fix broken circuit boards and other hardware to maintain operations, Yang said.      ‚ÄúWe usually have at least 10 people on staff to maintain a mining farm,‚Äù Yang said. ‚ÄúWith much fewer employees, it is hard for us to keep as many machines running as before.‚Äù      According to Yang, in some extreme cases where the local government prohibits all employees from working on site, companies need to negotiate with the government to leave two or three people on duty.

42431483,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2xFh,1580925066,"US Judge Dismisses Bitcoin Cash 'Hijack' Lawsuit Against Bitmain, Kraken","A U.S. court has dismissed a lawsuit accusing bitcoin cash proponents including Bitmain, Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu, Kraken, Kraken founder Jesse Powell and Roger Ver of manipulating the cryptocurrency's price during a 2018 hard fork that created bitcoin SV.      Florida-based tech and blockchain development company United American Corp ‚Äì ""UnitedCorp"" ‚Äì accused nine defendants of colluding to ""hijack"" and manipulate bitcoin cash during the 2018 network fork in what could be the first U.S. antitrust case to involve cryptocurrency companies. In addition to Bitmain and Kraken, the suit was filed against Bitcoin ABC developers Amaury Sechet, Shammah Chancellor and Jason Cox.      On Monday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Chris McAliley of the Southern District Court of Florida, dismissed the case without prejudice, meaning the plaintiff can file an amended version of the case.      The original complaint alleged Ver, Kraken and the bitcoin cash developers colluded with Bitmain to unfairly redirect hashing power at the exact time the fork was scheduled to take place. Not only did that force the network to implement the Bitcoin ABC design, but it also allegedly caused irreparable harm to the BCH network, to the detriment of UnitedCorp and other stakeholders.      UnitedCorp claims this collusion violated U.S. antitrust laws ‚Äì rules designed to promote competition in the market ‚Äì and restricted other companies' right to compete. The defendants each filed separate motions to dismiss last year, with some claiming UnitedCorp did not reach the required evidence threshold to proceed with its complaint.      Ver told CoinDesk the amended complaint was unlikely to change the eventual outcome of the dispute.      ""My understanding is that means that UnitedCorp basically has lost their case already, but the judge is letting them amend it to see if they can come up with a better argument,"" he said.      Sechet and Bitcoin.com have been removed from the list of defendants because UnitedCorp did not serve them in time. The court also dismissed UnitedCorp's motion for a 90-day extension.      Attorneys for Kraken, Powell, Bitmain, Wu, Sechet, Chancellor and Cox did not respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk.      UnitedCorp President and CEO Benoit Laliberte said the ruling showed the court ""recognized the importance of establishing law in what has been to date, a fairly undefined environment.""      ""Bitcoin was developed as a decentralized and distributed peer‚Äêto‚Äêpeer electronic cash system operating under democratic principles created within the network,"" Laliberte said in a statement sent to CoinDesk.

The ethereum-focused VC and technology company said it had completed the purchase of the Philadelphia-based Heritage Financial Systems, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. The acquisition gives ConsenSys advisory and broker-dealer capabilities in the U.S., allowing it to offer newly tokenized municipal bonds through its ethereum-based operating system, Codefi.      Local governments in the U.S. have issued municipal (""muni') bonds to finance public projects since the beginning of the 19th century. Worth nearly $4 trillion in Q3 2018, investors continue to place billions of dollars every year in municipal bonds. Net flows smashed records in 2019 when they exceeded $90 billion, according to a BlackRock report.      But although highly popular investments, muni bond trades frequently succumb to clerical errors; late repayments are common. Because authorities rarely issue debt in denominations smaller than $5,000, the secondary market for municipal bonds is relatively small and inactive.      ConsenSys believes distributed ledgers can disrupt the muni market by automating repayments and track obligations and bond transfers on the secondary market, while a smart-contract layer could also replace much of the legal contract work that presently has to be done manually by banks.      Blockchain could also help local governments issue municipal bonds in smaller denominations. Speaking to Bloomberg, ConsenSys' global fintech co-head, Patrick Berarducci, said the technology might encourage residents in the local community to purchase debt, instead of large financial institutions.      Agreement terms and ConsenSys' purchase price for the Heritage Financial acquisition have not been disclosed. The acquisition comes in the same week ConsenSys announced a 14 percent cut in staff numbers in order to refocus the company on its main infrastructure platforms, which include Infura, PegaSys, MetaMask and Codefi.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/05/consensys-acquires-us-broker-dealer-in-bid-to-tokenize-trillion-dollar-muni-bond-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01401e74acfef3b15cb5d07e98bce38b0e8cf4c3-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431498,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2xhh,1580914800,Lightning Labs Raises $10M Series A to Be the 'Visa' of Bitcoin,"Lightning Labs has raised $10 million in Series A financing as it gears up to launch its first paid service for merchants looking to accept bitcoin payments.      Craft Ventures led the round, with Managing Director Brian Murray joining Lightning Labs‚Äô board of directors. Other investors include Slow Ventures, former Goldman Sachs co-head of securities David Heller, Avichal Garg of Electric Capital and Ribbit Capital.      The funding round suggests some investors see the San Francisco-based startup as one of the few protocol-oriented firms with a prospective business model.      ‚ÄúIf bitcoin is going to reach its potential as a viable global currency, it‚Äôs going to need to scale beyond the base layer,‚Äù Murray said. ‚ÄúSimilar to how Visa relieves banks from handling all fiat currency traffic, Lightning relieves the base bitcoin chain from handing all transactions, thus bring more speed and fee efficiency to the network.‚Äù      Stepping back, Lightning Labs released a beta version of the scaling solution LND in 2018 and previously raised $2.5 million in a seed round from investors including Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Square executive Jacqueline Reses, litecoin creator Charlie Lee and former PayPal COO David Sacks. Lightning Labs also launched a mobile wallet app in June 2019, and as of today the company is offering a paid service called Lightning Loop.      Loop aims to help merchants manage their payment channels more effectively. Lightning payment channels need to have bitcoin in them in order to stay open, which is a problem for those who actually use these channels without a perfectly balanced in-and-out flow.      ‚ÄúLoop ‚Äòin‚Äô helps people put funds into their existing channel ‚Ä¶ kind of like a prepaid debit card for a lightning account,‚Äù Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark said. ‚ÄúLoop ‚Äòout‚Äô is currently the most popular product because it allows people to continue receiving funds on lightning.‚Äù      This service, which will charge a small percentage of each full loop, helps merchants and exchanges maintain liquidity in the channels.      With nearly a dozen lightning startups sprouting up over the past two years, Stark said her startup will distinguish itself by becoming an ‚Äúinfrastructure provider‚Äù to other startups.      The first Lightning Conference in Berlin attracted 500 participants in 2019, so there may initially be a small pool of developers and service providers willing to pay for back-end support. ‚ÄúThe way I see it, there will be an aggregate of financial services, of which Loop is one, and you can batch all of those,‚Äù Stark said. ‚ÄúThe blockchain becomes an anchor layer for other Layer 2 services on lightning.‚Äù      One example might include the shopping app Fold, which processed roughly 1,600 lightning payments during the 2019 holiday shopping season.      ""We‚Äôre growing fast and Lightning Labs‚Äô loop service makes it simple to manage our lightning node‚Äôs liquidity, letting our team focus on building out great user experiences that bring lightning to the world,"" Fold's Will Reeves told CoinDesk.    Infrastructure spending    Beyond Loop, Stark said her startup will focus on options for larger payment channels in 2020, both opt-in channels that can individually hold more than $1,500 and Atomic Multi-Path Payments, which break payments into smaller parts and are able to return the whole amount if all the small parts don‚Äôt promptly arrive at the same recipient.      River Financial CEO Alexander Leishman said his exchange startup, which uses LND to offer users lightning liquidity and trading functions, said Lightning Labs and ACINQ are the only two startups in the space focused on the ‚Äúnitty gritty‚Äù of protocol development.      ‚ÄúIf it allows us to support larger amounts [of bitcoin] off-chain, it improves the experience for our users. We‚Äôve already had users that are frustrated with the [Lightning Network‚Äôs] limits,‚Äù Leishman said. ‚ÄúServices that would make [lightning transactions] easy for us are definitely of interest.‚Äù      Stark, who is an adviser to Leishman‚Äôs exchange, said her goal for Lightning Labs is to enable automated services so the network will ‚Äújust work‚Äù without clients needing to tamper with channel allocation and flows. The peer-to-peer messaging app Sphinx also uses LND, which Murray said is only possible because of what Lightning Labs is building.      ‚ÄúLightning Labs is building the channels for bitcoin to fulfill its promise as a medium of exchange, a means of micropayment, as remittance infrastructure, and much more,"" investor Jill Carlson of Slow Ventures said in a press release.      Murray agreed, adding he strongly believes the infrastructure behind popular mobile apps will ‚Äútake a different shape‚Äù over the next decade because it will enable direct payments between peers instead of reliance on a third-party provider that monetizes user data.      In the meantime, Stark is optimistically curious about the ability to send ‚Äúsmall amounts of data and have payments attached to them.‚Äù      Speaking more broadly of the batched services Lightning Labs will offer by this time in 2021, she concluded: ‚ÄúThese are lightning-native financial services that help improve the network.‚Äù",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/05/lightning-labs-raises-10m-series-a-to-be-the-visa-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b45bdf91544ead6d4b6fc71096c9d1a87ae66498-2560x1706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Disparte, vice chair of the Libra Association, made the case for the consortium-managed cryptocurrency project. Shrugging off recent major corporate exits from the Association, Disparte made the case for Libra as a viable open-source platform for products that enhance financial inclusion.      The Libra Association is a consortium of companies working towards the launch of the Libra stablecoin, a cryptocurrency designed by Facebook for the millions of people who don't have access to banking services. Disparte says things are moving apace, despite the departures of some of the original members, including Mastercard, Visa and Vodafone.      ‚ÄúSo what we're seeing here is actually quite a lot of engagement,"" Disparte said, adding:    ""We've demonstrated over the last six months that we're not dogmatic in terms of our project structure and our approach and that we are very much taking on board the type of feedback we've heard from regulators and policymakers. So, you know, the gap is narrowing, in terms of what would be the types of issues we have to address in order to satisfy getting this project on board and moving ahead.""    Disparte believes the most important part of the platform is its open-source nature.      ‚ÄúThe technology standard that we've built is open,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo irrespective of whether an organization is a part of the association or not, there is an opportunity among them to develop on top of this network without having to be a part of the start-up efforts of the project or the governance of the project.‚Äù      He added, ‚ÄúAnd you know, the firms that have left, I think, have left with a door wide open for future opportunities to engage in collaboration. But right now, this is about a hardened core that are mission-aligned and wants to see through the governance and startup challenges that a project of this potential scale represents. So there's zero love lost and we very much believe that open technology permits future engagement at a later stage.‚Äù",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,TECHNOLOGY,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/05/libra-vice-chair-not-worried-about-the-leavers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d7977b44751b735e1179bf047ddd18c042c5e82-1927x1081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bakkt, in turn, will use its funds from its ongoing Series B fundraising round to acquire Bridge2 and apply its tools to its consumer app.      In a statement, Bakkt CEO Mike Blandina wrote, ‚ÄúWith the launch of the Bakkt app, we will, for the first time, offer consumers a robust platform to consolidate and use all of their digital assets, from crypto to loyalty points to in game tokens, in one user-friendly wallet.‚Äù      Bakkt will take advantage of Bridge2‚Äôs current relationships with banks and merchants, as well as its ‚ÄúLoyalty Pay solution‚Äù to launch products, he said.

""Merchants gain access to a broader set of customers with expanded spending power,‚Äù Blandina wrote at the time.

According to Arwen CEO and co-founder Sharon Goldberg, Slow Ventures led the round, which also included Collaborative Fund, Underscore VC and DG Lab Fund.      The funding will help the Boston-based startup expand its non-custodial settlement system, a layer-2 protocol that secures ‚Äúassets in motion‚Äù via atomic swaps, Goldberg said. In simpler terms, Arwen allows users to settle trades via an exchange‚Äôs hot wallet without actually handing over custody of the underlying asset.      The protocol currently supports bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum trades on the KuCoin exchange, though Goldberg said her company is in talks with ‚Äúinstitutional partners‚Äù interested in using the service. Demirors said an announcement is expected in Q2 2020.      Arwen‚Äôs non-custodial solution plays to high-dollar investors, according to Demirors ‚Äì the type of trader that wants quick access to liquidity, but wants to avoid the risks associated with hot (online) wallets. She pointed out hackers have proven time and again through 2019 that centralized honeypots are vulnerable, valuable targets to strike.      However, ‚Äúthis settlement technology can be used more broadly than just with centralized exchanges,‚Äù Goldberg said. In the long term, she sees Arwen providing settlement services to a wider market.      Jill Carlson, who led the funding round with her firm Slow Ventures, is also bullish on the technology‚Äôs long-tail potential to impact markets beyond crypto.      ‚ÄúThis problem of efficient clearing and settlement without more risk, it‚Äôs not crypto specific,‚Äù she said, adding that traditional capital markets rely on a sluggish settlement process that could also stand to benefit.      Carlson also identified another aspect of the Arwen funding round, one she said came more by circumstance than design: the deal‚Äôs major players are all women.      ‚ÄúI think it's really cool to see more and more female entrepreneurs in crypto,‚Äù she said.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | KSC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/05/jill-carlson-meltem-demirors-back-33m-round-for-non-custodial-settlement-protocol-arwen,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66fe648df6d55431455c940385ad358772bc12e7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A channel breakout seen on the four-hour chart indicates scope for a re-test of recent highs above $9,600.  A UTC close below Tuesday's low of $9,075 could lead to a deeper correction.    Bitcoin has bounced strongly in the last 24 hours, reviving the immediate bullish view.      The top cryptocurrency by market cap started picking up bids at lows below $9,100 late on Tuesday and rose sharply above $9,400 soon before press time, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Bitcoin was facing selling pressure yesterday and had looked likely to slide to the 200-day average at $8,867. After all, bitcoin had dropped below the former resistance-turned-support of $9,188, validating the bull fatigue, signaling by Monday's doji candle.      The decline, however, was cut short near $9,075 as noted above and the 3.5 percent bounce seen since has neutralized the case for a deeper drop.      Further, the cryptocurrency has broken out of its two-day long downward trajectory, as seen below.    4-hour chart    Bitcoin has found acceptance above the upper edge of the channel. The breakout indicates the pullback from Monday's high of $9,615 has ended and the rally from the Jan.24 low of $8,214 has resumed.      Supporting the breakout is the relative strength index (RSI), which has violated the descending trendline in favor of the bulls.      The MACD histogram, too, has crossed above zero confirming a bullish reversal.    Daily chart    Bitcoin has now erased Tuesday's losses, weakening the bearish doji reversal confirmed on Tuesday and validating the bullish crossover of the 50- and 100-day averages confirmed earlier this week.      The cryptocurrency has also moved back above the five- and 10-day moving averages, while the RSI is hovering in the bullish territory above 50.00.      A UTC close above Monday's high of $9,615 would likely cause more buyers to join the market, leading to a quick rise to $10,000.      On the downside, Tuesday's low of $9,075 is now the level to beat for the sellers. A potential failed breakout on the four-hour chart would shift risk in favor of a drop to $9,075.

Announcing the news in a press release Tuesday, San Francisco-based Securitize said the ""strategic fundraise"" came via corporate VC fund SFV GB L.P. as an extension of the firm's ongoing Series A round.      Securitize previously announced the round had raised $14 million back in September 2019, when MUFG Innovation Partners, Santander InnoVentures and others invested. In November, Japanese financial services company SBI Holdings joined with a sum of at least a million, Securitize CEO and co-founder Carlos Domingo told CoinDesk at the time.      The firm has not updated the funding raised to date, merely saying it's now raised ""more than $14 million.""

42403951,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh4nG,1580893200,Galaxy's Novogratz: XRP Will 'Underperform Immensely Again This Year',"XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, will have another lackluster year in 2020, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz told a roomful of financial advisers.      What's more, he blamed Ripple ‚Äì one of his firm's largest investments ‚Äì for what he sees as XRP's underwhelming prospects.      The fund manager, whose firm trades and invests in digital assets and startups, chatted onstage with personal finance superstar Ric Edelman at TD Ameritrade‚Äôs National LINC 2020 conference in Orlando, Florida last week.      At the end of the discussion, Novogratz fielded questions from the audience of Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs). The very last one was about his opinion on XRP, the native cryptocurrency of Ripple‚Äôs ecosystem. Although recording the event was forbidden, CoinDesk obtained a recording from an attendee.      ""Ripple the company owns 60 billion of the coins, of the XRP,‚Äù Novogratz began. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lot of it.‚Äù      The total amount of XRP in circulation is 100 billion tokens. While Ripple was ‚Äúgifted‚Äù 80 billion, its holdings are down to 56 billion, of which 48.9 billion are in escrow and the company cannot touch, according to Breanne Madigan, Ripple's vice president of global institutional markets.      Nevertheless, Novogratz likened XRP to a situation where a company continuously sells its shares.      ‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm buying a stock, if I know [someone‚Äôs] selling $10 billion-worth of it at some price, it makes me less excited to buy the stock,‚Äù he said.    Ripple responds    What makes this remark so biting is that Ripple is Galaxy Digital's largest single holding in another company. Novogratz's firm has put in $23.8 million into Ripple and valued the stake at $27.6 million as of September 30, 2019, according to public filings.      The analogy of XRP to shares is a particularly sensitive issue for Ripple. Over the past couple of years, Ripple has been fighting a class-action lawsuit claiming XRP is an unregistered security. The case remains ongoing at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.      ""XRP is a digital asset,"" Madigan fired back in an email to CoinDesk. ""It is not a stock as it does not give you any stake in Ripple or any other company. Second, XRP has legitimate utility for payments. Companies like MoneyGram, Bitso and others are using XRP in production through RippleNet‚Äôs On-Demand Liquidity (ODL).""      The company also dramatically reduced its programmatic quarterly token sales this past year, dropping from $251 million worth in Q2 down to none in Q4.      ""These statements make clear that Mike doesn‚Äôt understand how Ripple manages its stake in XRP and didn‚Äôt take time to read what we make publicly available every quarter,"" said Madigan. ""The increase of circulating supply from Ripple distributions of XRP is actually lower than the increase in circulating supply of BTC, BCH, ETH, etc.¬†""      When asked by CoinDesk to elaborate on his comments, Novogratz, through a spokesperson, added, ""On the buying side of that you do have a strong following of XRP in Asia, and an 'XRP Army' which pushes it hard.""      In 2019, XRP lost 46.3 percent of its value, according to data compiled by CoinDesk. At the Orlando conference, Novogratz suggested that the trend may continue.      ‚ÄúIt did underperform immensely last year,‚Äù he told the audience. ‚ÄúI think it will underperform immensely again this year and it‚Äôs just because of the supply.‚Äù      Through his spokesperson, Novogratz disputed having said ""immensely,"" but it is clearly audible on the tape.    Which is more centralized?    At the Orlando conference, Novogratz contrasted what he characterized as XRP's more centralized setup with that of bitcoin. ‚Äú[XRP] didn‚Äôt get distributed like bitcoin did with mining,"" he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got this one giant pool that are constant sellers.""      However, Ripple maintains its network is more decentralized than bitcoin or ethereum, the top two cryptocurrencies by market cap, according to data from Messari.      ""There are over 150 known validators on XRPL [XRP's distributed ledger] that require 80% consensus to confirm transactions,"" said Madigan. ""Ripple controls 7 out of those 150+ validators, making XRP more decentralized than BTC or ETH which are controlled by Chinese mining groups.""      So far, XRP has shown impressive returns in 2020. Prices gained nearly 27 percent since Jan. 1 compared to, say, the S&P 500, which was about flat year-to-date. However, if one were to quibble, XRP did indeed underperform bitcoin‚Äôs 29 percent rally.      ""One of the biggest problems the entire crypto industry continues to face is misinformation,"" Madigan added, in reference to Novogatz. ""There are so many that are willingly ‚Äì and knowingly ‚Äì feeding rumors to drive market activity. It is unfortunate that, despite our culture of transparency, influential market participants are ignoring the facts. This holds back the entire crypto industry.""",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH | XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | XRP,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/05/galaxys-novogratz-xrp-will-underperform-immensely-again-this-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/beb0e7bc9cc780ee75c24b90ed10d2fc3132615c-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a memorandum filed Sunday at the Southern District Court of Florida (see below), the legal team representing Ira Kleiman ‚Äì¬†who is suing for $10 billion in bitcoin ‚Äì has challenged Wright's ""illusory"" assertion that more than 11,000 company documents are inadmissible in court because they come under attorney-client privilege.      ""Craig [Wright] has improperly withheld documents as privileged,"" stated Kleiman's counsel in the case that claims Wright unlawfully seized part of the late Dave Kleiman's estate. They argue Wright has used the fact that documents come from 18 companies, most of them defunct, to ""hide"" the documents from the court.      ""[A]lmost all of the companies Defendant is using as a tool to assert 'privileges,' no longer exist ... any privilege these companies may have once had, does not survive their dissolution,"" claims Kleiman's legal team. As many of these pertain to the companies themselves, rather than to Wright personally, ""they are unequivocally not privileged,"" the filing states.      For the three companies that still exist, ""Craig‚Äôs privilege claim fails because he is not in the control group for these companies and therefore lacks standing to claim it,"" reads the filing. Attorneys claim Wright has ""purposefully orchestrated"" not being on leadership teams at the firms so as to be able to claim privilege ""when it suits him.""      The filing calls for the court to order Wright to present all documents from dissolved companies and third parties withheld under claimed privilege, as well as to clarify the privilege claims for other documents on the log.      Wright ‚Äì who claims to be bitcoin's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto ‚Äì has also said, according to the document, that the ""bonded courier"" ‚Äì a third party he claimed had the private keys to the 1.1 million bitcoin in the Tulip Trust at the heart of the case ‚Äì is also an attorney whose communications are privileged. The plaintiffs said they would ""challenge this shortly,"" further alleging this action ""continues to demonstrate a pattern of Craig's abuse of privilege claims.""      In August, a judge found Wright had argued in bad faith, perjured himself and admitted false evidence during the motion. The court then ordered Wright to hand over half of his alleged bitcoin holdings, as well as pay the plaintiff's attorney fees and any other related expenses.      Although Wright had initially agreed to a settlement that would see him hand over half the bitcoin held in the Tulip Trust, the court proceeding recommenced when he pulled out of the non-binding agreement in November.
