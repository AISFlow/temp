Cardano&apos;s community is home to investors who are investing for the long term rather than trying to take short-term profits from the market. This means that most investors have their coins staked on the platform to serve as validators on its proof of stake mechanism. The blockchain has grown in popularity since it announced smart contracts capability in September. Since then, various partnerships and initiatives focused on increasing usability on the network have been announced. This move seems to have paid off as Cardano saw a record number of total circulating supply hit an all-time high this week. Total ADA Staked Hits 73% Of Supply Cardano saw the total ADA staked on its network hit a high of 73.15% on Thursday, an impressive number compared to the number of coins staked on its direct competitors. At this point, the network had a total of 23.9 billion ADA staked across 921,323 delegators. The total circulating supply of ADA is only 33.26 billion coins, meaning that only less than 10 billion are not staked.

42424412,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2oA5h,1635539341,"Market Wrap: Ether Hits New High, Outperforms Bitcoin as Altcoins Rally","Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, reached a new all-time price high of around $4,400 on Friday, topping the previous record high of $4,379 in May, according to CoinDesk data.  ETH is up about 11% over the past week, compared to a 3% rise in BTC over the same period. Technical charts indicate further upside for ether relative to bitcoin, with an upside target toward 0.08 in the ETH/BTC price ratio as discussed in yesterday’s Market Wrap.  Overall, analysts expect further upside for cryptocurrencies for the remainder of the year despite occasional pullbacks, which can lead to choppy trading conditions.  “Bitcoin and major altcoins are experiencing strong volatility on the intraday chart, which is normal at all-time-high levels, like we have seen lately,” Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, Bitpanda chief product officer, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “The last negative days failed to damage the overall market structure, and fundamentals further indicate that the long term remains decisively bullish,” Enzersdorfer-Konrad wrote.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $62,346, +1.70%  Ether (ETH): $4,394, +3.08%  S&P 500: $4,605, +0.19%  Gold: $1,782, -0.97%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.55%  The great rotation  Despite recent volatility, some traders are starting to position for further upside in alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) such as ether.  “Lately, there has been an increasing number of conversations among investors around shifting portfolio allocations from bitcoin to altcoins to capture the higher returns alts have provided during more speculative risk-on periods,” FundStrat, a global advisory firm, wrote in a Thursday newsletter.  “The good news (for BTC and ETH price) is that the tides appear to be shifting towards a more risk-on fall in traditional markets,” FundStrat wrote.  Ether’s record high  Ether’s new price high coincided with improving blockchain data. The smart-contract Ethereum blockchain burned more tokens than it emitted in the last 24 hours, thanks partly to strong action in shiba inu (SHIB), CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported.  Shiba Inu, the platform behind the self-proclaimed dogecoin killer, burnt 770.12 ETH, becoming the third-largest ETH destroyer. Uniswap v.2 and Tether destroyed 2,729.22 and 1,248.72 ETH, respectively.  And some options traders are betting U.S. regulators will soon approve an ether futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) and so are buying cheap out-of-the-money calls in anticipation of a price rally.  High network demand  The chart below shows the recent rise in the Ethereum gas price, which refers to the cost of performing transactions on the blockchain network.  “Historically, when gas gets expensive, we’ve seen activity spike on alternative L1s [layer 1]. But now that Arbitrum and Optimism are live, L2s [layer two] could wind up being the primary beneficiaries,” crypto research firm Delphi Digital wrote in a blog post.  Altcoin roundup  Decentraland’s MANA surged 80% in 24h: MANA, Decentraland’s native token, surged 80% in one day to a market capitalization of more than $2 billion, CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma reported. This comes after Facebook’s announcement on Thursday afternoon that the company changed its corporate name to Meta to signal an increasing focus on the metaverse, which apparently spurred the jump.  Here’s why a CryptoPunk sold for $530 million: A Twitter bot that tracks sales of CryptoPunks flagged a transaction that showed the sale of one CryptoPunk non-fungible token (NFT) for a staggering half-billion dollars, CoinDesk’s Andrew Thurman reported. But while the purchase would’ve been one of the largest art sales in history, on-chain analysts were quick to point out the sale was just a clever bit of smart contract magic.

42394379,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvck27,1635535248,Facebook Steals Another Crypto Idea for Its Nonsensical Rebrand,"There is so much, too much, to be said about Facebook’s announcement yesterday that it is changing its corporate name to “Meta” as part of a refocus on what is, essentially, online virtual reality. Most of what is to be said is really not good for Facebook. This is a desperation move made in the face of a PR nightmare that has a slim chance of panning out as a market proposition, and basically zero chance of reversing the company’s declining political and market fortunes in the U.S. and Europe.  So, given the target-rich environment, let’s start close to home: “Metaverse” is the second buzzy concept that Facebook has misappropriated from the blockchain industry. It is likely to be just as poorly executed as Zuck’s first craven magpie act, the would-be stablecoin Libra, now known as Diem (Facebook screwed up that launch so badly it had to rename the product: Sensing a theme?). Libra or Diem or Novi or Calibra or whatever was an attempt to steal some vague crypto halo while actually creating a powerful stream of new data for Facebook, in direct contravention of the principles behind the entire model being appropriated.  Similarly, the true “metaverse” is a blockchain concept, but you can already tell Facebook’s metaverse will be as big a perversion of it as Libra was of Bitcoin. The core idea of the blockchain metaverse is wide interoperability of virtual assets stored on a neutral and verifiable ledger. The same blockchain tech that makes non-fungible tokens (NFTs) usable across, say, virtual galleries and (soon) Twitter would be used to create tokens that represent virtual reality assets usable across a variety of immersive experiences, from Decentraland to (let’s say, in theory) Second Life to Minecraft.  Though Facebook’s online VR will have some form of NFT integration, the broader vision is not what Zuck is rolling out. Much of yesterday’s announcement presentation was focused on his frustration with Apple’s App Store and Facebook’s plan to build a competitive, parallel walled garden focused on online VR experiences (I’m not going to call it “the metaverse,” because see above). They’ll be collecting fees on creators who, say, design a virtual sweater. Zuck yesterday even warned that fees on the platform would be high for a while (which, come on Facebook comms team, we know you’re sleepwalking through a state of moral paralysis, but at least pretend a little harder).  Zuck justified those high fees by explaining that Facebook (no, I’m not going to call it “Meta” either, because see above) will be building up its online VR business at a loss for a while, including by subsidizing devices. This speaks to one of the other huge warning signs for Facebook’s pivot. It’s already pretty clear very few people actually want to use VR, especially in the kind of persistent way that would make it a good walled-garden content store business. The Oculus VR devices at the center of Facebook’s plans have been pretty good technology for at least three or four years now, but sales have been unimpressive. Other VR and AR companies, such as the infamous Magic Leap, have burned money without finding product-market fit. Spending boatloads of cash to drive adoption is the only hope Facebook seems to have of making mass-market VR work.  That spending, too, shows just what a desperate move this is. It’s not that this wasn’t clearly a long-term plan – it may even have been in the cards with the purchase of Oculus way back in 2014. That absolutely did not pan out on its own terms, as Zuck is admitting when he says “we expect to invest many billions of dollars for years to come before the metaverse reaches scale.” Compare that timeline to the much faster payoff for Instagram after Facebook bought it in 2012.  (We may also see yet again how little Facebook means anything it says about user privacy. Oculus was developed and founded by Palmer Luckey, an ideological authoritarian who went on to found a military contractor, Anduril, that sells spy hardware like camera drones and recon towers, no doubt influenced by his engineering work on Oculus. Make of this what you will.)  A normal company, one not facing withering scrutiny for its abuse of its own users and the law, would probably not rename itself after a business that had already failed. And spending money to acquire customers is the behavior of a risk-taking startup using private VC money to increase its chance of capturing a novel business opportunity, like Uber using subsidies to win rideshare. It’s not obvious that the tactic makes any sense at all for a big public company trying to give life to a business that seems to have little traction of its own.  It also doesn’t make sense because the price of hardware like a VR headset isn’t actually the limiting factor in adoption Zuck would like you to think it is. In technology, there’s this thing called an “adoption curve” where early tech enthusiasts spend a lot of money on weird things, then more people buy them as they get cheaper. The first part of that adoption curve still hasn’t really happened for VR, even during a pandemic when everyone was trapped at home. Making the headsets cheaper can’t solve for this clear lack of interest among the very hyper-engaged audience that’s not supposed to care about price.  But the monopolistic outspend-the-competition approach comes from the playbook of another one of Zuck’s favorite people, the neoreactionary authoritarian Peter Thiel (sensing a theme here?). It probably gives Zuck some comfort to go back to a familiar playbook. And there are probably still enough credulous, bootlicking Web 2.0 investors out there that Zuck will be able to stave off total collapse just by saying something a la “you gotta spend money to make money, fam” on investor calls for the next 10 years as Facebook’s new VR unit, and then the entire company’s balance sheet, bleeds to death.  Because that’s the even bigger picture here. Leaving aside regulatory and legal concerns, Facebook as a company has probably already seen its best days. User numbers in the United States are declininghttps://www.yahoo.com/news/facebook-weaker-knew-123509841.html, particularly for young people, across both Facebook itself and, crucially, Instagram, which had extended the company’s relevance a few extra years. Facebook’s future, unfortunately, probably lies in second- and third-tier economies with even weaker governments and poorer citizens.  That will leave Facebook freer to follow its worst impulses. On the metaverse front, ironically, it may mean it winds up with something closer to the deepest origins of the term in Neal Stephenson’s “Snow Crash,” a masterwork of dystopian cyberpunk science fiction from the 1980s. Stephenson’s metaverse is a corporatized ghetto where the global poor play out a digital semblance of lives they can’t afford, while back in reality their emaciated bodies wither in cramped apartments.  The metaverse Facebook is building, in short, is a digital version of hell.

42424397,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2o9dh,1635535214,Here’s Why a CryptoPunk Sold for $530M,"Crypto Twitter was briefly ablaze Thursday night as a CryptoPunk non-fungible token (NFT) was purchased for a staggering half-billion dollars – a figure that would have made the sale one of the largest ever not just in NFT-land, but in all of art history.  However, on-chain analysts were quick to point out the sale may have just been an elaborate publicity stunt.  A Twitter bot that tracks the sales of CryptoPunks first flagged the transaction shortly before 8 p.m. ET (00:00 UTC Friday). If real, the 124,457.07 ETH sale worth over $530 million would have easily eclipsed the 4,200 ETH sale of an ultra-rare alien punk in March.  CryptoPunks have a floor price – a term referring to the lowest price at which a piece from a particular NFT collection can be bought – of 100 ETH, and the punk in question, #9998, lacks desirable features from a collector’s perspective, leading some to believe the purchase was a “fat finger,” a term referring to the immutable, irreversible errors endemic in blockchain.  A look at the chain, however, reveals that the purchase was just a clever bit of smart contract magic.  The purchase was made by a flash loan contract deployed by an address flagged by wallet profiler Nansen as a prolific decentralized finance (DeFi) user, NFT collector and smart contract deployer who also owns the blurr.eth Ethereum Name Service NFT.  Banterlytics, a contributor to on-chain analysis publication OurNetwork, told CoinDesk that the transaction was likely conducted solely “for the bantz.”  The transaction cost 0.19 ETH, or roughly $800, and the address included a message in the metadata of the transaction, saying “looks rare.”  A similar flash loan transaction was conducted in February to purchase a HashMask NFT for 139,000 ETH, currently the largest NFT sale on record – even if on a technicality.

Ethereum Exchange Reserves Are Down 18% In The Last 5 Months As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, ETH&apos;s exchange reserves seem to have declined a lot in the last few months, signaling that a supply shock might be brewing in the crypto. The all exchanges reserve is an indicator that shows the total amount of Ethereum present in wallets of all exchanges. An increase in the metric&apos;s value means investors are moving their coins to exchanges for selling purposes, thus increasing the available supply of the crypto. Such a trend could be bearish for ETH. A decrease, on the other hand, would imply that holders are taking their Ethereum off to personal wallets, either for hodling them, or for selling through OTC deals. This trend can prove to be bullish for the crypto.

42394378,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcjrr,1635531465,Jack Dorsey Is Right About Inflation – Partly,"Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey caused a stir among mainstream economic and political commentators when he tweeted last week about a threat to society from hyperinflation.  MSNBC’s Chris Hayes called it an “incredibly revealing tweet,” later suggesting it was self-servingly motivated by Dorsey being “heavily into crypto.” Calling the United States’ current bout of rising prices “hyperinflation,” Hayes said, is akin to promoting the antiparasitic drug Ivermectin as a cure for COVID-19. Wired columnist Virginia Hefferman called Dorsey’s tweet “insanely reckless,” suggesting that someone with his reach can deliver a self-serving prophecy.  Many in the Bitcoin community, on the other hand, applauded the Twitter CEO. Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer of the Human Rights Foundation argued that Hayes’ perspective was too narrow and that Dorsey was referring to people’s experience with inflation around the globe.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  For the record, I tend to agree with the more measured view of another Bitcoiner, Cathie Wood, who disputed that there is any sign of hyperinflation in the data. The term is typically reserved for cases where inflation of more than 50% per month, which when compounded results in an almost 13,000% annualized increase. (The latest U.S. consumer price index readout was up 5.4% from a year ago – the highest rate in 30 years, but nothing like Weimar Germany or Zimbabwe in the 2000s.)  But what I really want to focus on is how this episode reveals two different world views of inflation’s origins and, by extension, on how to keep it under control. I also argue that the Bitcoiner perspective offers a valuable framework for understanding the biggest risk factor in all this: a decline in public trust in policymakers. This loss of trust challenges the incumbent financial system and is a key reason why bitcoin, which stands as a hedge against that system’s outright failure, hit new all-time highs last week and is now up 20x since March 2020.  Balancing act  To break down how traditional central bankers’ see inflation risks, it’s useful to dissect Wired columnist Hefferman’s assertion that “the word @jack tweeted should not be uttered unless you’re trying to bring it into being.” As Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter pointed out, Hefferman was expressing Federal Reserve dogma: that inflation is derived from “expectations.”  The idea is that if people expect inflation, they will preemptively protect their purchasing power by asking for higher prices, or wages, for their goods or services, which reinforces other people’s inflationary expectations and prompts them to do the same, creating an upward spiral.  As Carter notes, this makes central bankers obsessed with their own messaging.  We’ve seen this concern with messaging take on special significance over the past decade, although throughout that time the Federal Reserve’s concerns were not with the psychology of inflation but with the opposite: a deflationary spiral, where expectations of falling prices lead people to postpone spending, which lowers demand for goods and services, which in turn pushes prices lower. To manage that, the Fed’s 12 voting members had to try to manipulate the thinking of the bond market.  With interest rates at virtually zero for over a decade, the Fed and other central banks instead tried to charge up a still-sluggish global economy via “quantitative easing,” printing money to purchase trillions of dollars in bonds and other assets to drive down market interest rates and keep credit flowing. That led to an increasingly complex psychological relationship between the Fed and the market.  On the one hand, the Fed worried that bond traders were overly worried that it was getting overly worried about inflation. If traders thought the central bank was going to prematurely stop bond purchases to let market rates rise to slow growth and curtail inflation, then there was a risk those traders would prematurely sell bonds, which would have the unwelcome self-fulfilling effect of driving up rates before a sustained recovery could take root.  On the other hand, the Fed also worried that if it was too overt in telling the market not to worry, it could drive asset prices too high, fostering a dangerous bubble.  As it performed this delicate balancing act, Fed policy became more about what was said – that it would tolerate above-target inflation for an indeterminate period in the future, for example – than about what was actually done.  Think about it: A group of just 12 people, with discretionary power to set the monetary policy for the world’s reserve currency, try to guess and manage the fears and hopes of billions of people worldwide, and then implement that policy via a meta-level mind game with Wall Street’s notoriously egotistical trading community. It seems kinda nuts.  Yet, in some respects this is the unavoidable outcome of a fiat monetary system created after the collapse of the gold-pegged, hard-money system in which monetary policymakers had no such discretion.  The bitcoin standard  With bitcoin there is, in theory, no capacity for this kind of mind game to arise. There is no uncertainty. Whether or not consumers, producers or bond market vigilantes like it, new bitcoins are created at a predictable rate that no one can alter, with total supply destined to top out at 21 million by the year 2140.  In a predictable system like this, the theory goes, no harm can come from what people say, whether it’s Dorsey spouting off or a central banker uttering the wrong choice of words, because the defining factor behind inflation – money supply – is predictable.  This perspective is framed by the famous maxim from monetarist economist Milton Friedman that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.”  Note: Friedman did not mean that, absent a change in monetary conditions, prices won’t change. Prices will always be impacted by demand and supply conditions. But without monetary distortions, one-off price changes provide a mechanism for attaining stability because demand and supply for the good or service in question will adjust accordingly until market equilibrium is reached.  What Friedman was referring to was not these one-off price increases but inflation, which he defined as a “steady and sustained rise” in the economy’s general price level. This, he argued, can occur only with monetary expansion, which, all things being equal, leads to a cycle of higher prices from a larger supply of money in circulation.  Trust  Few central bankers would dispute that monetary conditions contribute significantly to inflation. But because they’re not naturally inclined to find blame for inflationary pressures in their policies, they tend not to focus on their own role in creating those conditions and instead try to correct the behavior of everyone else: the consumers, producers and investors whose decisions dictate demand, supply and pricing expectations.  Central bankers are right to point to frequent examples where suboptimal market behavior, especially irrational herd-like behavior, leads to financial crises. This includes the practice of hoarding hard money such as gold – or potentially bitcoin – which exacerbates the currency’s scarcity, reduces transactions and fosters deflation.  But the bigger risk, one that they fail too frequently to recognize, is that these policymakers can lose the public’s trust. This is especially a concern when inflation starts to appear in fiat-based economies. Without people’s trust, all that carefully calibrated signaling and messaging is meaningless.  Monetary systems tend to act like a pendulum. They swing between rigid, hard-money conditions to offset the loss of trust in discretionary policymaking and then break free of those rigidities to give a monetary boost to growth.  Right now, after a decade of uneven growth where sharp asset inflation has coexisted with stagnant median incomes for the general public, we may be entering the former phase. There is a greater risk than perhaps at any time since the 1970s that trust in government leadership of the economy will drop to untenable levels.  That’s why even this modest pickup in inflation has people legitimately worried that it could grow into something bigger. It’s why it should be okay to mention the “H word” – if only to put it on the table, as a risk to consider.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Michael J.

The round was led by Three Arrows Capital, Cardano’s cFund and Ascensive Assets, with participation from Morningstar Ventures and Mechanism Capital.  Ardana co-founder Ryan Matovu told CoinDesk in an interview that in many cases this will be the first Cardano-native project in which many of the participants have invested – perhaps a sign institutional investors are beginning to believe in the chain as the next emergent DeFi hub.  “Cardano is going to follow the path we’ve seen from chains other than Ethereum,” said Matovu. “Step by step other alternative chains pop up, and what we’ve seen is that a few teams build key protocols and then the ecosystem pops up around them.”  Building blocks  According to Matovu, Ardana is targeting a number of verticals that are popular on other chains.  “The simple comparison is that we’re building the MakerDAO and the Curve Finance of Cardano with foreign exchange on top,” he said.

Per Matovu, the protocol is “90% of the way through development,” and targets a late-Q4 release for the stablecoin vaults and exchange.

The native token of Ethereum’s blockchain rose to $4,402 during Asian hours, topping the previous record high of $4,379 reached in May, according to CoinDesk data.  At the going price of $4,370, the cryptocurrency is up 45% on a month-to-date basis versus bitcoin’s 40% gain. The ether-bitcoin implied volatility spread is rising in a sign that the market expects ether to continue leading the price action in the coming weeks, as Thursday’s First Mover newsletter mentioned.  Data tracked by Tokenview shows Ethereum produced 15,109.34 ETH and burned 16,710.2 ETH in the past 24 hours. That’s a net supply reduction of 1,600 ETH.  Shiba Inu, the platform behind the self-proclaimed dogecoin killer, burnt 770.12 ETH, becoming the third-largest ETH destroyer. Uniswap v.2 and Tether destroyed 2,729.22 and 1,248.72 ETH, respectively.  SHIB has rallied a staggering 800% this month, hitting a record high of $0.00008870. According to Defi Llama, the total value locked in ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange that allows users to stake SHIB, has doubled to $512 million this month.  Coin burning refers to the process of removing tokens from circulation and is the crypto market’s equivalent of a stock buyback.  The Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 implemented on Aug. 5 EIP 1559, burns a portion of fees paid to the miners, removing a notable chunk of coins from circulation. The upgrade has tied the amount of ether burned with the network usage.  Since activation, the upgrade has destroyed 668,339 ETH, representing over 50% of the new coins issued over the same period.  Some options traders are betting that U.S. regulators would soon approve a futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) and are buying cheap out-of-the-money calls in anticipation of a price rally.

The jump in the virtual world’s token to $1.26 at last check was apparently spurred by Facebook’s announcement Thursday it is changing its corporate name to Meta to signal an increasing focus on the metaverse.  Or as CEO Mark Zuckerberg, speaking at a conference on augmented reality, put it, his company will now be “metaverse first, not Facebook first.”  “MANA’s leading position in the metaverse ecosystem will likely be solidified further by Facebook’s move to rebrand and focus on building its own extension to the digital world,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital.  “Tokenized gaming has really taken off as a trend in the last few weeks and Decentraland is by far the most established of the bunch,” said Mati Greenspan, CEO of Quantum Economics.  Nearly every asset within Index Coop’s Metaverse Index (MVI), an index that tracks crypto assets and protocols building out the virtual world, is up on the day. Sandbox (SAND), which is a virtual world where players can monetize their virtual experiences, is up 31%, according to the MVI. The play-to-earn game and virtual world, Axie Infinity’s token, AXS, has also surged 17% in the last 24 hours.  Facebook’s commitment to building out the metaverse, evidenced by its plans to hire 10,000 European Union-based staff, is a signal to the market that there is incredible value to be unlocked, said Mason Nystrom, a senior analyst at Messari.  Virtual reality  Vinokourov is still bullish on Decentraland’s MANA, now valued at $2.4 billion. “This market cap is far from extreme, given the sector growth potential,” he said.  Virtual worlds like Decentraland and Sandbox have stark differences to Facebook’s Meta vision for the metaverse, according to Nystrom.  Nystrom explains that he expects Meta to build “moats” around the metaverse, creating digital walled gardens, so that the holding company and its family of networks (for example, Facebook) have the ability to make money off it. Digital worlds like Sandbox and Decentraland, by contrast, will allow developers and gamers to make money for themselves.  “Essentially it’s the difference between a closed (Meta) and open (crypto) metaverse,’’ he explained.  Investors will likely want access to both avenues because how the metaverse will unfold is largely unknown, said Nystrom.",POSITIVE,AXS | MANA,AXS | BTC | MANA | MARKET | RESEARCH,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/29/decentralands-mana-jumps-80-as-facebook-rebrand-fuels-metaverse-bets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9fcd784d234e1ccd4722fb9c0704cbd21025ad90-2560x1703.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

AIMA’s Global Crypto Report, released over the summer, showed that around 20% of hedge funds are now investing in the space.  As a fund manager, protecting intellectual property, the complex algorithms, systems and data that allow them to generate returns, is paramount. That is why cybersecurity is an important consideration for both traditional managers moving into the space and newer startup funds.  George Ralph, global managing director of cybersecurity firm RFA, has witnessed a large uptick in crypto clients in the U.K. looking for security and infrastructure solutions.

In an unexpected twist, the hacker responsible returned a large majority of the stolen funds after experts and businesses said they would track their activity on the blockchain. Mt. Gox, the world’s largest bitcoin exchange at the time, filed for bankruptcy in March 2014 after hackers stole $460 million worth of crypto.  “Simple and secure storage solutions are urgently needed for the more than 221 million crypto users around the world who are targets for fraud and theft,” according to Jon Wilk, CEO of CompoSecure.  “More than $8 billion in crypto has been hacked or stolen in 2021 thus far, doubling the previous year, including examples of crypto exchanges being hacked, personal devices being compromised, or usernames and passwords being phished that were part of these growing losses,” Wilk said.  Read more: The Poly Hack and Crypto’s Trust Issues  With regard to crypto fund launches, the key thing in terms of threats is event-driven, there is a huge focus on insider threats, said RFA’s Ralph, and this has been exacerbated by the move to working from home following the COVID-19 outbreak.  Investors looking to launch funds in the post-COVID era are having to hire people they have never met before; conducting checks on potential new hires is harder in this current paradigm, Ralph said.  Peter Habermacher, CEO of Aaro Capital, said the “key targets for criminals are usually bank accounts or the assets of a fund. However, leakage of confidential information, intellectual property and personal data can be equally harmful and the issues in this regard can sometimes be internal.”  But not all that’s new is without precedent.  “Crypto asset funds are like hedge funds in the 1990s”, said Habermacher. “The market is dominated by startup managers who are operationally weaker than their established counterparts in traditional asset management and, as such, they often do not have the necessary cybersecurity procedures in place to completely satisfy institutional due-diligence processes.”  More needs to be done on the regulatory side, Habermacher said, to ensure that “crypto service providers such as exchanges and custodians are properly regulated and adhere to minimum security and process standards.”  Crypto criminals stole $1.9 billion in 2020, according to a report from blockchain sleuthing firm Ciphertrace, down from $4.5 billion in 2019.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/29/why-cybersecurity-is-an-important-consideration-for-crypto-hedge-fund-launches,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a80e4fe24a83071712219fbe381825b6d16d3db1-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

These criteria encompass engagement levels and long-term support, meaning genuine stakeholders are given favor over those who can execute the quickest transactions with the highest amount of gas possible.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on Friday published its guidance for providers wishing to offer ETPs linked to the performance of cryptocurrency, following a request from market participants for feedback in June.  For crypto to be a permissible asset to back an ETP or other structured product, it must meet five criteria: a high level of institutional support and acceptance, reputable and experienced service providers to support the products, a mature spot market, regulated futures markets for trading derivatives and robust and transparent pricing mechanisms.  On this basis, bitcoin and ether “appear likely to satisfy all five factors ... to determine appropriate underlying assets for an ETP,” the ASIC said.  An exchanged-traded fund (ETF) offering exposure to crypto-focused companies provided by ETF manager BetaShares is expected to start trading in Australia soon.

The market has seen groundbreaking sales, with collectors having spent over $2 billion on NFTs in the past month alone, compared to only $250 million in the entire year of 2020, according to NonFungible.com. The staggering statistic can, in part, be attributed to artists like Beeple making record-breaking sales this year, when the artist sold a singular artwork for $69 million at Christies, the third-highest price of art on record. By definition, NFTs are digital files that provide buyers with proof of ownership and authenticity. They live on the blockchain, a decentralized ledger, making them highly secure. NFTs provide buyers with one-off ownership, giving collectors a sense of exclusivity in the same way that they would when buying an original Picasso painting. To sell an NFT, artists have to sign up their artwork on a marketplace and upload their data onto a blockchain, minting their digital tokens, which costs approximately $40 to $200. They are then ready to list their artwork for auction. Although many people may balk at the idea of &apos;owning&apos; a digital file, the NFT craze has proven to have many merits in the art world.

The token buys entry to an online game inspired by hit Korean Netflix show “Squid Game,” one of the streaming platform’s most successful shows of all time, according to the white paper.  However, Gizmodo noted several suspicious signs about the token, such as grammatical and spelling errors in the white paper, the fact that the project’s website was registered less than a month ago, and users’ inability to reply to its Telegram and Twitter posts.  Speculators looking to trade the token may face challenges. CoinMarketCap warns that users have been unable to sell the token on decentralized exchange PancakeSwap.  Squid was at $0.012 on Oct. 26 and is quoted above $4.20 on CoinMarketCap at the time of writing, up more than 35,000% since Tuesday and more than 270% in 24 hours.  In the online game, as in the show, competitors take part in six contests, with players eliminated in each round. An fee is required to enter each game, starting at 456 squid for the first round and increasing as the tournament progresses. The majority of the fees are pooled together to make up the winner’s reward, while 10% of the funds go to the development team.  Unlike the 456 debt-ridden players in the TV show, “everyone here in crypto world can participate” by buying the token, the white paper said. On the game’s website, the “Play” button says it’s “COMING SOON.”  Play-to-earn gaming has surged in popularity in recent months, with Axie Infinity among the most well known. In some countries players have been able to earn more in the game than in their regular jobs, to the extent that local authorities are said to be looking to tax player’s revenue.

Red Date CEO Yifan He said NFTs will be widely used in China in the next five years, but the government doesn’t want the technology to be associated with crypto or running on public, permissionless chains.  “If we look at the environment in China, this is the only way to launch NFTs,” He said.  On the BSN-DDC, developers will have access to 10 “open permissioned” chains on the BSN to build their NFT platforms. He called for more public chains to join the project.  The infrastructure can also be deployed on nodes outside the BSN, He said.  “What I see here is that every company that has copyright and IP (intellectual property) is considering NFTs,” the CEO said, adding that they are working with a major company in the film industry.  The project will launch by the end of January 2022, He said.  Last week, Chinese media reported that China’s big tech giants Ant Group and Tencent changed references to NFTs on their sites and platforms names to “digital collectibles.”  He said that they changed the name of NFTs to DDC, “like everyone.”  Read more: China’s BSN Builder Is Registering a Nonprofit in Singapore to Manage International Arm",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/29/bsn-architect-red-date-to-launch-nft-infrastructure-in-china,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee4f73e77a7572a46d81c947fcef91ff0f94d9ca-5987x3991.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
