42378576,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ifJX,1454021932,Santander: Blockchain Talk Could Turn Into Action This Year,"During their introduction at this week's Distributed Ledger Challenge in New York, Santander InnoVentures managing partner Mariano Belinky and Banco Santander R&D chief Julio Faura spoke at length about the bank's interest in the blockchain and how it believes the technology can significantly reshape how it does business.  ""It’s something we really believe is going to change the world,"" Faura said at the time.  Held this Wednesday, the event saw five startups pitch their businesses to a panel that included both Santander officials as well as representatives from the bitcoin and blockchain space. In the end, Cambridge Blockchain, a startup focused on identity solutions for blockchain-based systems, took home the $15,000 prize.  It was a gathering that both Belinky and Faura indicated had exceeded their expectations, and one that may be repeated in the future.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Belinky and Faura suggested that the competition was a reflection of the shifting attitudes within Banco Santander toward the technology.  Belinky told CoinDesk:  ""Ten months ago we were having discussions around 'What is blockchain?', 'What is this technology?’ [and] 'Why are we so excited about it'. Now are getting to a level where we can have some informed discussion about this or that use case, whether we want permissioned or permissionless [blockchains], and which stakeholders and other banks we should talk to.""  Faura said that the bank's leadership is giving its research team, which he leads, a degree of independence when approaching possible applications of the technology. However, he cautioned that any commercial products that may emerge are contingent on further experimentation, as well as the development of industry standards.  ""We're being given enough freedom to work on it and everybody seems to be quite excited, but it’s not like we are betting the whole bank on new technology that we still don’t understand,"" he said.  Evolving experiment  According to Faura, the bank’s early investigation of the technology focused primarily on bitcoin and how the digital currency – it being a network of pseudonymous actors who don’t need to trust one another to transact – would impact its business.  But it was after the Sibos banking conference in Boston, held in September 2014, that both Banco Santander and other financial institutions began to solidify how they might go about actually implementing their own types of blockchain systems, he said.  ""At that point, after Boston, I think, that’s where the blockchain vs bitcoin debate started,"" he said. ""So, I think at that phase we understood that using distributed techniques was a good way to get more efficiency, reduce costs and overall have a much better service for our clients.""  Faura said that Banco Santander has been investing more time exploring the use of smart contracts as a vehicle to pursue concepts like machine-to-machine payments and micropayments.  It was this year, he suggested, that the bank may push more aggressively toward in the coming months.  ""The other experimentations around smart contracts and micropayments and so on, we’re being a bit more visionary here. We're trying to lead it, we're trying to find new things to show to our clients,"" Faura said.  From talk to walk  Both Belinky and Faura suggested that the next six to 12 months would be significant for Banco Santander’s blockchain efforts.  Belinky said that after months of experimentation and testing, he hopes the bank will move forward on a product that, in time, could be presented to its customers for possible use.  ""My hope is that we have a implementation we can talk about. I’m getting really tired of talking about it,"" he said.  Yet to get to that point, he continued, would require a series of steps that includes regulatory and legal approval and further testing to reinforce operational resiliency. This work, he said, would take place in the context of both internal work and alongside other banks in groups like the consortium led by New York-based startup R3CEV.  ""It’s a question of how can we go through all of those tests,"" Belinky explained. ""In some cases, we are working with other institutions, and in others it’s happening on our own.""  For Faura, the next year will be shaped by further tests and conversations with industry stakeholders and other financial institutions, as well as its client base.  ""I think this is a good beginning,"" he said.

42378585,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ifUr,1454013051,Bank of England to Explore Distributed Ledger Tech for Settlement,"The Bank of England has indicated it will consider the impact of distributed ledgers as part of a plan to modernize the country’s settlement system.  During a speech given at the Bank of England yesterday, Minouche Shafik, the central bank's deputy governor for markets and banking, laid out a four-point vision for the initiative, which has the mandate to deliver goals by the end of this year, with technological development beginning in 2017.  The blueprint will seek to answer four questions, Shafik said. These include defining the bank’s policy objectives, determining what functions the payment system should have, establishing who should be able to access the system and electing the right role for the Bank of England to play in the service’s delivery.  As for distributed ledger technology (DLT), Shafik said that the innovation poses ""profound challenges"" due to its ability to decentralize the verification of payments, with a communal ledger serving the role of a traditional third party.  Shafik said:  ”It may reshape the mechanisms for making secured payments: instead of settlement occurring across the books of a single central authority (such as a central bank, clearing house or custodian), strong cryptographic and verification algorithms allow everyone in a DLT network to have a copy of the ledger and give distributed authority for managing and updating that ledger to a much wider group of agents.”  Shafik continued by saying that DLT will be analyzed alongside other innovations such as electronic money, new methods of payments and machine learning.  Rooted in history  In statements, Shafik sought to position the project as one that was close to the Bank of England’s historical goals. Her remarks drew deeply from the history of the central bank, beginning with the story of why it emerged as a way to settle financial obligations between domestic institutions.  Also mentioned was how this mandate has been updated over time following the integration of new technologies, with an emphasis directed toward the real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) introduced in the mid-1990s.  ""By allowing banks to settle high value transactions between each other, electronically, in real time, RTGS eliminated settlement risk on the largest payments flows – the ones most likely to threaten financial stability by bringing down the system if they failed,"" Shafik said.  Given that the system is now 20 years old, Shafik said the time had come for the organization to reconsider how it would deliver on its mandate even as the pace of technological change accelerates.

42378575,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ifIH,1454010036,"Amid Scaling Debate, Bitcoin Core Goes on Outreach Offensive","Even many of its members acknowledge Bitcoin Core has had a communication problem.  The largely volunteer development team, which provides peer review and testing for the bitcoin network's underlying code, has been on the defensive following the decision by a former member to criticize the project for failing to take what he considered to be adequate measures to handle a greater volume of transactions.  From there, the problem has only escalated.  Feeling the pressure from a particularly negative news cycle, bitcoin businesses soon began looking to support proposals that offered what they believed were solutions that would prove faster than Bitcoin Core’s development roadmap. One alternative, named Bitcoin Classic, has served as a rallying point for those who want to institute a 2MB block size, up from 1MB today.  Less publicized has been the 7th December roadmap penned by Blockstream co-founder and Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell.  The roadmap, compiled with Maxwell's estimation of consensus among the developers, advocated for the community to increase the capacity of the protocol not by increasing the limit on the size of the blockchain’s data blocks, but by making a change to how information on the network is counted toward this metric.  Called Segregated Witness, the proposal would, among other less publicized fixes, increase the blockchain’s capacity four-fold without requiring a hard fork that would change bitcoin's consensus rules, a process that they believe may be too risky at present.  Still, many community members and businesses remain unclear about the recommendations and how the roadmap was produced.  Given that the issue has so often been termed the “block size debate” by the press, there is confusion as to whether Segregated Witness solves the scaling problem at all, or whether it’s an attempt to put off a hard fork – a change that many in the industry believe will eventually be needed given that the network only processes 1MB of data roughly every 10 minutes.  The idea that a 2MB increase might be risky hasn't exactly resonated with some members of the wider community.  Put more simply by Block C's Matt Carson:  ""In a day where Google offers gigabyte fiber for $80 a month, the argument that a 2MB block might be too big doesn’t really make sense.""  False start  Other community members professed confusion over the positioning of the initial announcement, given that it was made over a developer mailing list rather than through an official website or press push. It was a move that created an impression of informality that developers suggest was not intended.  More problematic is that, since the Bitcoin Foundation stopped funding former Bitcoin Core maintainer Gavin Andresen and other Core developers, the project has had no official institution to speak on its behalf. As a result, there has been a degree of distrust even when Bitcoin Core does take unified action to speak, with many assuming the self-interest of the parties in question.  But, in the midst of the drama, the team of developers that comprise Bitcoin Core have moved to boost their outreach efforts, launching a new website on 15th January and a dedicated Twitter account on 22nd January.  The actions, though seemingly minor, seek to better illustrate Bitcoin Core's message. Publications on the website have so far sought to stress the benefits of Segregated Witness in terms that are more akin to a traditional marketing campaign.  Driving this effort is the fact that members of Bitcoin Core stand by the roadmap, and are keen to showcase that, counter to what critics say, the proposal is one that has been thoughtfully reasoned and carefully considered.  Current Bitcoin Core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan told CoinDesk:  ""I think scaling proposals have been done to death at this point. In my opinion, the time of discussion and planning is over for now and we need to move on with actually realizing the roadmap.""  Bitcoin Core demystified  Of course, while the above statement may seem authoritative, it’s not the same as, say, a CEO issuing a mandate to his or her company. Even as a maintainer who manages the software release cycle for the project, Van der Laan is only able to speak for himself and encourage conversation.  For example, van der Laan added that Bitcoin Core will still consider alternative proposals for scaling that are posted to the mailing list.  ""This needs to be an active area of research,"" he said.  Adding to the confusion is that, even in the bitcoin industry, it remains unclear how Bitcoin Core makes key decisions. The malaise is arguably a product of the quickly mounting price escalation at the end of 2013 that distracted businesses and media from focusing on the still extremely nascent technology underpinning sensational claims from increasingly well-capitalized startups.  In practice, Bitcoin Core's dynamics are easier to understand.  At workshops surrounding Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong, the culture was evident, as was the informal hierarchy held in place by individuals that value expertise and the ability to deliver results.  Speaking in the developer team Slack group, one developer said: ""People just take on parts that interest them with only informal coordination.""  To those close to the project, it can be hard to determine the source of the communication issues.  Van der Laan, who is now supported by MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative, acknowledged, however, that there is a culture gap given Bitcoin Core's own history.  When viewed through the lens that Bitcoin Core’s earliest developers largely started by donating their time to developing an online currency created by an individual that they never met (or so they say), the groupings today are more understandable.  ""'Bitcoin Core' was never an organization, just a loosely coupled group of overworked mostly-volunteers contributing to a piece of software, so it has never had an unified message,"" van der Laan told CoinDesk.  Still, van der Laan opined that the group has recognized the problem, and that members of Core are now doing what they always do, mobilizing through their own volition to find solutions.  Culture change  Even as more visible developers including former Core maintainer Gavin Andresen and Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik donate time to other pursuits, work on the Bitcoin protocol carries on.  Each developer continues to maintain a 'branch' of the network, different from the contentious 'fork', that if it proves worthy of wider consideration is submitted to a staging area where it is subject to review and debate.  Merging such a change can be a lengthy process, requiring peer review and revision. For example, the cryptographic library libsecp256k1 was in a state of research and development for over two years, and now replaces the ""buggy and slow"" OpenSSL in validating transactions on the network. Core representatives estimate that signature validation is now 7x faster as a result of the effort.  Such actions are plainly visible on GitHub, but as members acknowledge, just because something is made public doesn't mean it will reach a broader audience.  One of the more active developers addressing this issue is a UK developer who goes by the name BTC Drak, or Drak for short, and whose Twitter icon includes a notable reference to ""Lord of the Rings"".  Amidst the clamor over the scaling debate, Drak has been one of the figures helping the project enact changes in how it fosters public dialogue.  Drak explained:  ""Public forums have not been an effective way to communicate because of the sheer volume and fast pace of people commenting. Everything tends to get drowned out.""  For Bitcoin Core members, the primary forums for communication include the text communications protocol Internet Relay Chat (IRC), the web-based code management program GitHub and a mailing list.  ""This has lead to the impression that developers are inaccessible and not listening,"" Drak argued.  Van der Laan continued that those who are seeking to engage the group also have to be mindful that Bitcoin Core is an existing, and functioning, developer unit with its own entrenched processes.  ""If you decide to get in contact with us, and feel welcome to do so – be civil, remember that this is a volunteer effort,"" he said.  The comments are meant to be constructive, more akin to a restaurant owner reminding guests that they can't simply walk into a restaurant's kitchen without waiting for a seat.  Still, though they voiced a desire to focus on positive messaging in their formal outreach, some Core members indicated they have negative feelings to those who have sought to disparage the project's efforts without understanding its processes.  Changing ways  This is partly because Bitcoin Core did have established ways in which it was attempting to communicate to the public even before the recent communications push.  Bitcoin.org, a separate open-source community resource, for example, has long been the resource where new bitcoin users could download Bitcoin-Qt, the project’s free wallet.  Bitcoin.org, like a number of other high-profile bitcoin forums, recently came under criticism for delisting a wallet offering by California startup Coinbase, one the ecosystem’s best-funded companies, over its positions on the scaling debate.  ""It became awkward for us because of the community belief that Bitcoin.org and Bitcoin Core were on in the same. This accelerated the wish to have a separate website,"" Drak said.  Drak said he spent the holidays building out an alternative website for use by Core. Johnson Lau provided Chinese translations and Jonas Schnelli then contributed design work.  Eric Lombrozo, a Bitcoin Core developer and CEO of multisig wallet startup Ciphrex, seconded the idea that Core has been needing to change how it communicates by enlisting individuals who can act as ""liasisons and emissaries"" like Drak for the Bitcoin Core team.  Lombrozo said:  ""Business executives, with a few exceptions, don't usually feel comfortable chatting on #bitcoin-dev on IRC. The only way to bridge these gaps is with individuals who feel at home in two or more said cultures who can serve not merely as points of contact but as fluid conduits.”  Of particular interest is for the project to find individuals who can liaise with the industry’s active mining community, most of which is based in China, and the media, given that Core members believe it played a pivotal role in creating the perception that its scaling roadmap did not have widespread support.  Lombrozo said:  ""We need to find ways to have Core dev points of view satisfactorily represented in publications that reach these communities and other forms of media.""  New offerings  Bitcoin Core also opened a Slack group on 10th January that it believes can be more accessible to new, less-techy members who can help the project in different ways.  ""Humans are social animals and tend to think the worst when there is silence or lack of communication,"" Drak told CoinDesk. ""Slack is helping to grease the wheels as it were.”  Still, van der Laan said that the group doesn't intend to stray drastically from its culture, even if its messaging is more formal.  When asked who would be in charge of managing the Bitcoin Core blog and Twitter account, van der Laan said that members will still largely continue to communicate to the community in their own words and as they see fit.  Van der Laan, as did other Core developers, sought to stress that the communication effort is in the spirit of other open-source software projects that issue both technical and non-technical blog posts.  Still, as for how much will change as a result of these efforts, van der Laan was careful to temper expectations owing to the volunteer nature of the project, concluding:  ""As with software changes, it all hinges on what volunteers are willing to write.""

Under the deal, Symbiont will use Gemalto's SafeNet hardware security modules (HSMs) to protect blockchain identities and transactions, with the aim of preventing theft, forgery and other types of criminal activity.  The HSMs will provide protection for Symbiont's platform by ""securely managing, processing and storing"" cryptographic keys, Gemalto said. It added that the devices are used by a number of large financial institutions to protect more than $1tn dollars in financial transactions every day.  The firm explained in a statement that integrating its HSMs ensures the ""highest levels of regulatory compliance and trust for cryptographic identities authorizing these transactions"".  Mark Yakabuski, Gemalto's vice president of business development strategy, said:  ""Bringing Gemalto's market-leading HSM security modules assurance to Symbiont's Smart Contract Blockchain solution is not only an exciting offering, but a clear step towards securing blockchain-based transactions.""  Automating legacy systems  Symbiont utilises blockchains to allow institutions and investors to issue, manage and trade a range of financial instruments more efficiently over an encrypted peer-to-peer network.  These instruments, which Symbiont calls 'smart securites', are self-enforcing, self-executing contracts that can offer cost and time savings compared with transactions brokered using legacy systems.  Once a security is issued onto Symbiont's distributed ledger, it acts autonomously, eliminating the traditional manual processing of financial transactions.  Founded in 2014, Symbiont raised $1.25m in June 2015, and issued its first smart security on the bitcoin blockchain shortly after, in August.  Based in New York, the startup has roughly 10 employees and is focused on capital markets applications of blockchain teach.

42378590,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ifb9,1453989915,Deloitte: New Blockchain Applications Will Accelerate Adoption,"'Big Four' professional services firm Deloitte has published a report that takes a look at the potential uses of blockchain technology while arguing that its acceptance and wider adoption are fast approaching.  Introducing the paper, two of the firm's partners say that while the tipping point for the technology may not occur until around 2027, Deloitte anticipates adoption ""will occur much faster"" as new applications emerge.  Deloitte anticipates a number of applications for blockchains across various industries. In a statement accompanying the paper, it cited some example use cases to illustrate the technology's potential.  In the banking and insurance sector, for instance, blockchains could be used to ""strengthen and streamline"" compliance checks on customers and reduce the risk of fraud, the paper contends.  In the media and entertainment industry too, it said, blockchains offer new business models to content owners, such as music artists. And in the public sector, there are opportunities to use blockchains for tax collection, to facilitate voting or as the official registry for government assets.  The firm suggested that, for these solutions to be adopted, it is ""critical"" to create a trusted environment for blockchain-based services, particularly when it comes to ensuring ""robust and secure"" authentication and identification.  Deloitte stated:  ""By using technologies such as decentralised architecture, cryptography and digital signatures, blockchain has the potential to offer a high level of assurance, as well as adding some new and unique characteristics to identity management.""  Primer for industries  Deloitte said the paper aims to help leaders in different sectors ""navigate the emerging opportunities offered by blockchain technology"".  It further discusses some of the challenges facing organizations as they start planning to adopt the technology.  With diagrams to assist newcomers to the technology, the paper kicks off with an easy-to-understand breakdown of how blockchains work, the different types that can be employed and a definition of what Deloitte believes constitutes a blockchain.  It then proceeds thought three main sections covering blockchain technology as the ""Internet of Value-Exchange"", key challenges it faces, and what it will take to move from just an intriguing concept to real-world applications.  A final section breaks down the use cases across banking, insurance, the public sector and the media.  Deloitte revealed last summer that it is already seeking to use blockchain technology to automate client auditing and crowdsource consulting efforts, among other applications.

42378589,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ifZt,1453959663,Identity Startup Wins $15k at Santander Blockchain Competition,"A Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company developing identity solutions for blockchain-based systems won $15,000 at a startup competition hosted by the venture arm of Spanish banking group Banco Santander yesterday.  Announced in November  , the Distributed Ledger Challenge was organized by Santander InnoVentures, the $100m FinTech venture fund created by Banco Santander in 2014, and Onevest, a venture capital network based in New York. The Amazon Web Services Pop-up Lofts, a working space located in Manhattan, hosted the event.  Cambridge Blockchain, which won the event, was one of five finalists that saw more than 100 entrants submit pitches. In addition to Cambridge Blockchain, the list of finalists included Coinprism; ExiVest, a startup equity dark pool project; Midasium, a startup seeking to develop smart contracts for the real estate industry; and blockchain rewards network startup Ribbit.me.  It was through Santander InnoVentures that the Spanish banking group invested in Ripple and Digital Asset Holdings. The firm later published a report on potential cost savings banks could unlock with the technology.  The panel of judges featured Mariano Belinky, managing partner for Santander InnoVentures; Julio Faura, head of research and development for Banco Santander; Juan Jiménez Zaballos, director of corporate innovation for Banco Santander, Greg Shvey, partner for TradeBlock; Peter Smith, CEO and co-founder of Blockchain; and James Smith, CEO of Elliptic.  The event opened with an introduction by Belinky and Faura, followed by a question-and-answer session with the panel of judges.  Both Belinky and Faura spoke to the interest within Banco Santander, as well as the broader financial industry, in using other implementations of the code that underpins bitcoin and other digital currencies.  Faura said during the remarks:  ""We’re talking about smart money, money that can be programmed, we’re talking about new use cases, new functionalities, we’re talking about payments, machines paying, machines talking to machines, about new financial products.""  Faura went on to tell the packed room that Banco Santander sees distributed ledgers, as well as other types of financial technology, as a means toward achieving new ways of doing business, something that wasn't as high a priority for the bank in past years.  ""It’s something we really believe is going to change the world,"" he said.  Ledger pitches  The event saw five startups pitching their ideas to the gathering of bank executives, technologists and startup entrepreneurs. Each firm had eight minutes to make their presentations,  CoinPrism CEO Flavien Charlon, like others at the event, pitched his project by appealing to pocketbooks of the various types of financial services that could see potential cost savings by using blockchain-based systems.  ""There is an increasing amount of regulation being applied to financial services. That means more reporting, more auditing,"" he said. ""But most financial services aren’t in a position to follow those requirements because of their outdated systems.""  Cambridge Blockchain CEO Matthew Commons also pitched his identity-focused startup in the context of regulatory compliance.  He said his firm’s platform incorporates a blockchain that allows transacting parties to learn certain types of information about one another without compromising their full privacy.  Commons argued that his firm can provide a means for banks to manage access to distributed ledgers that they might use – and make it easier to use these types of systems in the first place.  ""This is one of the most critical areas where blockchain technology needs to improve if it’s going to get out of the lab and into real enterprises,"" he said.  Ribbit.me CEO Greg Simon, who announced the recent closure of a $1.5m funding round during the event, framed his startup as a means for merchants and other companies that offer rewards the program to shave costs by making the process of onboarding customers or adjusting programs more efficient.  ""If they want to add someone else, or change the rules, the legacy system isn't dynamic like ours is,"" he said.  Midasium CEO Michael Smolenski said he and his team wanted to build a system for creating smart contracts for real estate tenants and owners.  He pitched programmable transactions, which would exist on a blockchain embedded within the payments system of whichever bank is using it, as a new way to manage relationships in real estate. Smolenski said that banks would benefit because it would provide a new avenue for gathering data, information that could later be used when determining the creditworthiness of a borrower.  ""Banks would really love to have access to this real-time data, because at the moment it's based on a paper-based system and Excel spreadsheets,"" he said.  ExiVest founder and CEO Zeeshan Mughal pitched a platform a dark pool – a trading environment in which identities are private – for private startup equity, using blockchain technology as a mechanism for settling trades.  Following the presentation, some of the judges suggested that startups might balk at the idea of ceding some control of who can obtain control of equity in a startup, a point that Mughal conceded would be an issue for some startup equity holders.  He went on to defend the use of blockchain technology for the project, saying that ""the blockchain allows us to be more transparent.""
