42393742,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpA0fb,1678748968,Banking Crisis Won’t Kill Crypto Banking Despite Short-Term Pain,"The crypto ecosystem was built on the belief that no one entity, meaning a bank, should be in charge of one individual’s finances. However, until that becomes a reality, traditional banking will likely have to serve as a bridge between centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi).  Thus, the shutdown of Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank will certainly cause headaches for the industry in the short term as many crypto companies search for new banking partners, uncertain if larger entities will even want to touch crypto companies anytime soon.  “For now it's not clear what new financial institutions will partner with these crypto companies in the wake of Silvergate, SVB and now Signature,” said Ilya Volkov, CEO of and co-founder of YouHodler, a Swiss-based international fintech platform providing a variety of Web3 crypto and fiat service.  “The industry is currently running out of options and that needs to be addressed soon to prevent further problems,” Volkov added, noting that it will cause some fear-based reactions from the investors.  In the long run, however, this contagion shouldn’t hurt the crypto industry because there will likely be other smaller banks that could bridge the gap. “Crypto liquidity is likely to take a hit in the short term but this is an opportunity for new innovative challenger banks to step up and take the place of SVB, Silvergate and Signature,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at digital asset market maker DWF Labs.  Read more: The Banking Crisis Is Not Crypto’s Fault  Circle and USDC are surviving (so far)  Perhaps Circle’s ability to quickly secure an automated settlement partner serves as one such prime example. The stablecoin issuer found itself in the middle of the chaos as its USDC depegged from theoretical $1 value after Circle said about $3.3 billion of USDC’s cash reserves were stuck in SVB, and that Circle could no longer mint or redeem USDC through Signature’s Signet product.  However, by late Sunday Circle was able to find itself a new automated settlement banking partner with Cross River Bank, keeping it open for business on Monday.  “It would be shortsighted to assume that the events of the last few days will lead to a total divorcing of crypto and traditional banking,” said Joshua Frank, co-founder and CEO of provider of information services for digital assets, The Tie. He expects a rapid emergence of alternative banking partners and said there are still a few banking options available to U.S. crypto companies such as Cross River Bank and BankProv.  Another bank that could help the crypto industry, according to Boris Revsin, managing partner at Tribe Capital. “There are other innovative banks, like Western Alliance Bank, that will continue to offer banking rails like what Silvergate and Signature offered and many more that will be looking at this technology as an opportunity for growth,” said Revsin.  Another potential solution would be for the crypto companies to look outside of the U.S. for banking partnerships and use strategies involving stablecoins,  “Crypto companies need to look globally for offerings, and they should consider a diversified stablecoin strategy for payroll, contractors and vendors to become more antifragile for the foreseeable future,” Revsin noted.  On-chain banking and other adaptations  Another novel idea, to which only crypto can help provide a solution, is on-chain banking, according to Brent Xu, CEO and founder of cross-chain DeFi protocol Umee.  “Future banking should become on-chain. That means that banks are going to start to more resemble blockchains as opposed to purely centralized entities,” Xu said. Such technology will allow the banks to have “on-chain metrics related to their exposure to AFS (available for sale) securities like Treasurys and to allow better on-chain metrics for their cash management activities, he added.  Regardless of the outcome, every bear cycle in crypto has experienced such conundrums and came out stronger, Xu said. “Having been in this industry for as long as I have, this news doesn’t surprise me to the point where we have become numb to the effects. It is to be expected,” he said. This won’t mean the end of crypto banking, he added. Rather, institutions that don’t adapt to new technology will be left behind.  “The crypto industry has gone through banking shifts like this every cycle. We won’t see a shortfall of banks. More so, we will see a shortfall of legacy banks that support this tech,” Xu added.

42393756,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpA1pP,1678748630,"Bitcoin Surges as Bank Client Rescue Eases Contagion Fears, Fuels Hopes for Fed Dovishness; Binance's $1B Conversion Helps, Too","Bitcoin surged above $24,000 for the first time in over two weeks as investors exhaled once U.S. regulators stepped in to back deposits at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank (SBNY), and grew hopeful the near-meltdown of the banking sector would prompt the Federal Reserve to ratchet back its monetary hawkishness.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization traded as high as $24,574 Monday midday, according to CoinDesk data – before recently retreating slightly above the $24,200 mark, still up over 10% over the past 24 hours. BTC dipped below $20,000 last Friday (UTC) as SVB collapsed.  But a number of analysts said markets were buoyed by the regulators’ decisions late Sunday to make whole depositors at crypto-friendly Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank. Earlier in the day, New York state’s top regulatory agency shuttered Signature, saying it had “taken possession of the bank to protect depositors.”  “The [federal] bailout for depositors has alleviated some of the fears surrounding contagion risk, which resulted in a short squeeze,” Martin Leinweber, digital assets product specialist at MarketVector Indexes, told CoinDesk.  Monday’s surge caught traders who bet on prices falling off-guard, forcing them to liquidate some $81 million of BTC short positions over the course of the day. Leinweber noted that “the majority of these (positions were) placed on Friday when concerns were heightened.” These types of short squeezes tend to push prices higher.  USDC depegging chaos  In an email to CoinDesk, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, said “an outflow” from Circle’s USDC stablecoin to bitcoin and Binance’s decision to exchange stablecoins from its recovery fund to bitcoin and ether also led to price increases.  On Sunday, Binance said it would convert $1 billion worth of Binance USD (BUSD) to bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), BNB coin (BNB) and other tokens to support the market. The move likely contributed to buying pressure, as CoinDesk reported.  Meanwhile, markets may have been encouraged by what some analysts believe will be a more dovish tone from the Federal Reserve, which has been stung by criticism in recent months that it was raising interest rates too aggressively. On Sunday, Goldman Sachs analysts forecast no rate hike at the Federal Open Market Committee's March 22 meeting after the recent banking stresses, according to a report.  Yet, MarketVector’s Leinweber said that despite temporary bailout relief, sentiment remains “apprehensive and cautious.” He sees concerns raised over “possible further banking fallouts” and businesses that “are industry critical due to the inability to efficiently manage cash flow.”  “Bears have voiced their major points of concern, including that none of the policies address the fundamental duration mismatch problem that many of these financial institutions have,” he said. He added: “The ability to borrow secured from the Fed at par (rather than at market prices) only helps in a distress situation and does not address the mismatch in assets/liabilities and over-reliance on zero-interest large deposits.”  In an email to CoinDesk, Joshua Frank, co-founder and CEO ofThe Tie, a provider of information services for digital assets, struck a cautiously optimistic note.  “The loss of Silvergate, SVB and Signature is devastating for U.S.-based crypto companies,” Frank wrote. “That said, the crypto market has at least temporarily responded to the bailouts well. In light of the uncertainty surrounding banking in the U.S., the narrative of bitcoin as a hedge and safe haven has gained steam.”  Frank added: “While short-term positive, there are still many long-term macro factors to be wary of. U.S. regulators are clearly trying to de-bank crypto, the macro environment does not look great, and major financial institutions went under. If crypto - and in particular bitcoin - is going to continue to recover, we will likely need to see widespread support for this emerging narrative similar to what we saw in 2020/2021 with the bitcoin halving/inflation hedge narrative.”  Elsewhere in markets  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, recently rose by over 7% Monday afternoon to change hands around $1,675. Layer 2 protocol Optimism's native OP token surged 21% Monday. LDO, the governance token of the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind liquid staking system Lido, gained 15%.  The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures the overall crypto market performance, was up over 10% for the day.  Equity markets turned mixed Monday afternoon: The S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index, closed down 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) slid 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%.  Among crypto-related stocks, Marathon Digital Holding (MARA) closed up 25% after it said it still has access to $142 million at Signature Bank.

Beeple made headlines in the early days of the NFT boom when he sold his most famous work, “Everydays: The First 5,000 Days” for $69.3 million in a Christie's auction in March 2021. It has remained one of the most expensive NFTs ever sold to date.  The opening event for Beeple Studios took place on Saturday and was done in partnership with art auction house Christie’s. The gallery walls were lined with artwork from NFT artists Fvckrender, XCopy, Pak, Victor Duarte, Refik Anadol and others.

42421331,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqjV,1678746531,Bitcoin Was Built for This Moment,"The failure of Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank continue to ripple through the markets, causing U.S. bank stocks to plummet. Most recently, Charles Schwab's stock was halted in trading Monday morning. Meanwhile, bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market are experiencing a double-digit rally, which may be the first time that bitcoin is rallying in a risk-off environment. Perhaps this is exactly the moment bitcoin was built for.  Tatiana Koffman is an angel investor, author and creator of the weekly newsletter MythOfMoney.com.     The Bitcoin network was created as a direct response to the Great Financial Crisis in 2008, during a period when many hardworking people felt both the government and the financial system were working against them. In fact, the very first block of Bitcoin had an inscription in the code: ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of the second bailout for banks.""  Now that regulators are gearing up to backstop another centralized financial institution, which collapsed in part due to an aggressive monetary policy at the Federal Reserve and what appears to be either poor risk management or greed, it’s important to heed Satoshi Nakamoto’s message.  For years I’ve been talking about the “Great Reset”, a concept that advocates for us to stop trusting centralized institutions with the things that matter most. After all, these institutions are run by people who are not necessarily better or smarter than us but they make all the decisions and mistakes for us.  See also: What Now for Crypto Banking? | Opinion  Bank runs  If we look at the sequence of events over the last week, we quickly begin to recognize the errors of human centralization. Last Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell outlined a new approach to the Federal Reserve's policy path, indicating that interest rates may continue to rise for a longer period than previously expected. The expectation of higher interest rates for a prolonged period of time almost immediately sent a ripple effect through the bond market, causing bond prices to drop drastically because prices move opposite to yields.  At the same time, Silicon Valley Bank was forced to sell some of the 10-year bonds on its balance sheet at a 20%-30% discount to meet obligations amid a period of climbing withdrawals. As rumors of a cash shortfall began to circulate, a full-on run on the bank ensued and regulators took over. This caused even further panic.  Could every regional bank go under? After all, according to fractional banking rules, most of these banks only hold only 5%-10% of your capital in reserves, making every bank vulnerable to a bank run.  And then there was the obvious question as to who led the risk management department that decided it was okay to buy 10-year securities for an institution that has daily cash flow obligations to their depositors.  When the current economic slowdown began last year, many were worried crypto failures, such as those at FTX, Three Arrows Capital and Terraform Labs, would spread to traditional finance. But the exact opposite happened because the Silicon Valley Bank failure directly impacted the stablecoin market.  USDC depegs  USDC, the second-largest U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin after USDT, is run by Circle. Circle's model is simple – it takes your money and gives you a digital coupon called USDC. Then it takes your money and invests in super-liquid three-month U.S. Treasury bonds (currently yielding 4.87%). What could be safer?  Well, Circle reasonably decided that it should still keep some cash on hand and spread it across six different banking partners, one of them being Silicon Valley Bank. As SVB began to go under, Circle announced it had $3.3 billion deposited with SVB, creating a hole of over 5% in its balance sheet.  Panic ensued as USDC lost its dollar peg and dropped below 87 cents on Saturday. Traders quickly switched to tether, the largest USD stablecoin, although questions have been raised about its issuer’s business practices and reserves. I personally chose to move a large portion of my holdings into bitcoin, apparently like many.  The depegging of USDC is significant because Circle, considered a highly regulated and secure business, was poised to go public as a separate entity. The incident provided a wakeup call to investors, demonstrating that ""not your keys, not your coins"" applies not only to banks but to all centralized entities, even those that run our stablecoins.  Circle tried to restore trust by announcing it will use its corporate resources to cover any shortfall, which caused the stablecoin market to rebound by Sunday evening. As a result, USDC and DAI (which has significant USDC reserves) have returned to their dollar peg, and it is expected that USDC will now trade at par after compensating for SVB depositors. But is that enough?  Who do we trust?  Our assets may be bouncing back but the shock to our nervous system, however, remains. How can we trust anything centralized? How can we keep our money in banks above the FDIC-insured limit of $250,000? Could the insurance fail? How can we keep our money in stablecoins that use the same banking partners?  See also: Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank Reignite ‘Moral Hazard’ Dilemma Bitcoin Was Designed to End | Opinion  Bitcoin's beauty lies in its ability to store value in a decentralized manner backed by math, without requiring humans to validate or support it. No one lends out 90% of your deposits to make a profit, there is no possibility of a bank run and no one gambles with your hard-earned money on bonds.  Bitcoin was made for this moment, and it seems the market agrees. The Great Reset presupposes a future where bitcoin is the most valuable asset and the ultimate measure of value. It is what we use to store our wealth, perhaps selling small pieces for stablecoins to pay our daily expenses, but nonetheless only trusting this decentralized store of value.  The concept of decentralization, however, applies to other areas as well, such as how we run our communities, allocate resources and decide what our government should or should not control. A significant shift is underway, and more people are opting out of the traditional system.

The FBI and the Southern District of New York have interviewed former employees of Terraform Labs, the company behind terraUSD, and sought to interview others, according to the Journal.  The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil fraud lawsuit in February against Kwon and Terraform Labs in federal court in New York, accusing them of misleading investors about terraUSD’s risks. The Justice Department’s investigation covers similar ground, according to the Journal’s sources.  Federal prosecutors are also examining chat-group discussions among prominent trading firms Jump Trading Group, Jane Street Group and failed FTX affiliate Alameda Research involving a potential bailout of terraUSD, according to a separate report from Bloomberg, citing a person familiar with the matter.  Such a bailout never took place, but the investigation is seeking to determine whether the firms were involved in possible market manipulation. TerraUSD and its sister token, luna, both eventually collapsed, setting off a series of high-profile failures of prominent crypto firms, including hedge fund Three Arrows capital, Voyager Digital and FTX.  The Department of Justice previously alleged that an unnamed crypto firm – believed to be Jump – had bailed out terraUSD once before, in an indictment against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.

42421325,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqdJ,1678744775,USDC's 'Black Swan' Depegging Could Have Been Avoided With Proper Regulatory Framework,"The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank ricocheted through the crypto ecosystem, even causing Circle’s USDC stablecoin to depeg from the dollar this weekend. The momentary fall, which has since been reversing, was symptomatic of a black swan event, as Circle noted, but also of a larger truth: Stablecoins exist in a dangerous state due to the lack of a regulatory framework.  John Rizzo is senior vice president for public affairs at Clyde Group, and a former senior spokesperson at the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  It would be understandable if America’s failure to implement a regulatory framework for stablecoins were due to the topic's sheer complexity. Unfortunately, that’s not the case, and you don’t have to take my word for it.  Nations and governing bodies worldwide are moving forward with crypto regulation, including regulation related to stablecoins. Europe has managed to weigh the risks and benefits of crypto assets and establish a European Union-wide framework. France’s National Assembly is already implementing it. The United Arab Emirates recently put its crypto framework in place, with Hong Kong proceeding with its regulatory framework. Japan, which was early to crypto regulations, is tweaking and refining its own laws.  See also: Silvergate’s Struggles Will Likely Boost Stablecoins’ Role in Crypto Trading: Kaiko  It would be less understandable but more rational if the lack of a regulatory framework for stablecoins were due to a government's failure to prioritize the topic. However, that’s not the case either.  In November 2021, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) produced a comprehensive report outlining a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The report, led by the U.S. Treasury Department and drafted while I served as Treasury’s senior spokesperson, included signatories including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Commodity Futures Trade Commission (CFTC), the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The signatories recommended bank-like regulation of stablecoins to prevent runs, federal oversight of custodial wallet providers and other measures, like 1:1 backing of stablecoins and prohibitions on commingling customer funds.  The need to fully implement the report’s recommendations was evident when the PWG report was released in November 2021 and reinforced during critical events, such as the failure of algorithmic stablecoins and the FTX crypto exchange’s collapse.  In both instances the U.S. financial system merely dodged a bullet. In the case of the algorithmic stablecoins, their market was too niche and new to cause broader ecosystem disruption. Moreover, during FTX’s fall crypto was not yet sufficiently intertwined with the traditional financial system to cause contagion.  Look to the left  Despite these two near-misses and a searing reminder of the risks this weekend as Circle depegged from the dollar, the prospects for the kind of legislation outlined in PWG’s report remain uncertain. The impasse is not an issue of complexity, simple government inertia or Republican opposition.  Instead, as someone who has spent his career working to elect Democrats, it pains me to note fissures on the politicalbleft – between those who believe stablecoins pose risks, possess potential and require regulation, and those who think crypto should be outlawed completely – are primarily responsible for the lack of progress.  Those on the left who wish to banish crypto into the dustbin of history are acting out of a genuine belief in what’s best for the economy and the American people. However, I believe this perspective is risky and wrong in three critical ways.  First, this thinking misunderstands how assets acquire legitimacy. Many on the progressive left believe that government regulation of stablecoins and crypto more broadly would provide undue legitimacy. In contrast, I assert it is crypto’s market cap, which indicates its use, that gives it legitimacy. It’s the people who get to decide, not the government.  Second, the effort to outlaw crypto or regulate it into a nonfunctional space overestimates the government's capacity to implement such actions effectively. As a result, it’s more likely that crypto would move overseas into opaque jurisdictions with fewer controls, thereby raising the risks to the financial system if contagion occurs.  See also: Stablecoins Are Not Worth the Risk | Opinion  Finally, the progressive left’s perspective ignores the innovative potential of stablecoins and crypto. The crypto ecosystem, part of a broader trend of digitization in finance, simply has too much unrealized promise – to improve the payment system, foster financial inclusion and give everyday people more power over their economic lives – to ban it.  There’s no political or practical pathway to a ban on crypto or stablecoins. From Mt. Gox to FTX, crypto has proved more resilient than the proverbial cat with nine lives. So instead of pursuing bans we should foster crypto’s innovative potential and mitigate risks, beginning with stablecoins.  As we hold our breath during this time of upheaval, the solutions we need are already in front of us.

Enter First Republic Bank (FRC), a nearly 40-year-old bank whose stock is down even more badly, despite the fact that it has never been hacked.  First Republic’s 62% swoon led the banking sector’s nosedive Monday as Wall Street digested the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, both of which did business with crypto companies. By comparison – and in a completely separate corner of finance – euler is down roughly 50% following an exploit in which an attacker used a flash loan to plunder nearly $200 million from Euler Finance, a permissionless protocol that facilitates crypto lending and borrowing.  The two assets were the biggest losers in their respective markets on Monday. Elsewhere in the stock market, assets mostly traded sideways by the session’s close. But in crypto nearly every asset rallied following the news that all bank depositors would be made whole.  FRC’s and EUL’s price actions underscores how investors' perceptions of market events can be more influential than the actual events themselves. First Republic has not defaulted, gone insolvent or been seized by the government; in fact, it raised $70 billion over the weekend to shore up its liquidity.

42421338,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqph,1678740968,It’s Not Just Fraud That Chilled Crypto Regulation,"What a difference a year makes. On March 9, 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden’s office released its executive order on digital assets, marking the first official sign of a comprehensive approach to the regulation of the crypto ecosystem. At the time I and many others saw this as a very big deal, not least because of the strong signal that crypto had “arrived.” It was now significant enough to warrant attention from the leader of the world’s largest economy, and the surprisingly supportive tone of the document surely meant that a constructive regulatory approach was brewing. How wrong I was.  A year later, the supportive tone has pretty much disappeared. The comprehensive approach we hoped for turned out to be more of a threat than we anticipated, and the focus is now on erecting barriers rather than building a guiding framework. What happened in the interim?  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Part of that answer is unfortunately obvious. The ball of fraud-fueled fire that was the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange in November was a spectacular embarrassment to not only crypto businesses that had confided in then-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and his team. It was also an embarrassment to the politicians who had sat down with him, had posed for the photo-op and had entertained his ideas about crypto regulation. With a few brave exceptions, politicians understandably closed ranks and scrambled to distance themselves from anything to do with crypto risks.  But the shift is more complex than it might seem. Even before the FTX revelations, the tone from the Biden administration was more antagonistic. Absent from the executive order were calls for a clampdown; it was more about requesting investigation and reports, more about gathering information and ideas.  In September, the White House published an update, which mentioned the implosion of the Terra ecosystem in the first paragraph. Further down, the update stressed the loss of value in the market, how sellers “commonly” mislead consumers and how noncompliance with existing laws is still “widespread.” Already this was sounding very different.  The update also set out some White House recommendations, the first of which was that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) “aggressively pursue investigations and enforcement actions against unlawful practices in the digital assets space.”  The crypto fallout presented Washington, D.C., with a problem it could show the world it was doing something about.  The second recommendation was that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) “redouble their efforts to monitor consumer complaints and to enforce against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices.”  The third was that agencies should “issue guidance and rules to address current and emergent risks in the digital asset ecosystem.” You get the drift.  The rest of the report emphasizes support of FedNow, the Federal Reserve’s instant payment network due to launch in mid-2023, as a solution for financial exclusion – in other words, the U.S. doesn’t need crypto payments efficiency, it has the Fed.  And then we have the official document released in January of this year, titled “The Administration’s Roadmap to Mitigate Cryptocurrencies’ Risks.” You almost don’t need to read it to know what it contains – the last sentence of the very first paragraph spelled it out: “As an administration, our focus is on continuing to ensure that cryptocurrencies cannot undermine financial stability, to protect investors, and to hold bad actors accountable.” The tone had moved from supportive to antagonistic to somewhat panicked.  But to blame the shift in the U.S. regulatory tone on crypto fraudsters is simplistic. Another significant change in the regulatory backdrop between the executive order and the two updates is the economic mood, and this is more significant than many realize.  Read more: George Kaloudis - The Banking Crisis Is Not Crypto’s Fault  When the executive order was published, the Federal Reserve had not yet started its interest rate hiking campaign; it would kick this off with the first 25 basis point hike at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting the following week. The market knew rate hikes were coming. U.S. headline consumer price index (CPI) data showed inflation was rising rapidly, reaching 7.9% for February (this would be reported the following day) – but it was seriously underestimating how high it would go. The implied rate 12 months out, according to the fed funds futures market, was a now-laughable 2.87%.  At the time of the executive order, dark clouds were already building for equities. The S&P 500 was round 4270, 10% down year to date. By the time of the update in September, it had fallen almost another 10%,and tech company layoffs were starting to populate headlines. Understandably, with investors hurting, the government had to seem tough on risky, largely unregulated assets that had caused deep losses. In other words, the markets needed a “bad guy” to distract from what was shaping up to be a bleak scenario in all asset groups.  November delivered the ultimate “bad guy” as the FTX fraud shocked both the crypto ecosystem and mainstream observers. For a while it was an unwelcome distraction from a core inflation rate that had reached the highest level in four decades, a dollar that was at its highest relative to a basket of other currencies in two decades, and U.S. Treasury market volatility not seen since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009. Things were looking bad on macroeconomic screens, but the crypto fallout presented Washington, D.C., with a problem it could show the world it was doing something about.  The current hostility is about more than the political satisfaction of prosecuting criminals, however. It’s a natural reaction to broader concerns. When times get bad we seek comfort, and new, complicated and disruptive technologies are never comfortable. When times get bad we instinctively magnify external threats, because that makes us feel more connected to our tribe. When times get bad we focus more on surviving today and less on building a productive tomorrow. When times get bad the leadership manuals tell us to act stronger than we feel in order to inspire trust.  On a more practical level, if the economy is about to enter a downturn, the Biden administration would probably prefer that businesses and individuals invest in more traditional, high-employment endeavors than in this newfangled notion that seeks to disintermediate national authority.  I’m not suggesting the administration’s hostility toward crypto assets is just for show. I do think that it is not just because of the brutal hits to investors over the past 10 months. It is also because of the darkening clouds over the U.S. economy.  Read more: David Z. Morris - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank Reignite ‘Moral Hazard’ Dilemma Bitcoin Was Designed to End  This has a silver lining. Just as administrations change, so do economic cycles. The antagonism is far from uniform – Thursday’s House Financial Services Committee hearing provocatively titled “Coincidence or Coordinated? The Administration’s Attack on the Digital Asset Ecosystem” is a case in point. There was a fair amount of skepticism and outright distrust among some lawmakers and one of the witnesses. But most of the witnesses and many of the elected officials present were eloquent advocates for clearer rules and a usable framework. All agreed that regulation was good, and most seemed to support the idea of market reform and the need to keep crypto business in the U.S.  Hearings rarely achieve anything in the short term but they are an opportunity to stick political stakes in the ground. The initial approach of the new House Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion is encouraging in its apparently critical take on current policy and political process. Its chair, Representative French Hill (R-Ark.) made a sharp point in his written statement after articulating the need to support innovation for the sake of leadership and competitiveness while ensuring appropriate controls and accountability:  “These are the administration’s own principles articulated in its Executive Order, though their recent actions seem to conflict with these principles.” (my emphasis)  Indeed they do. The White House might argue that recent industry events have shown that suppression of U.S. crypto activity is in Americans’ best interests. But this lamentable shift is about much more than protecting investors from fraud – it’s a reflexive reaction to the broader economic threats gathering on the rapidly approaching horizon.

Bear in mind, though, that the U.S. government had said all depositors of venture capital-linked SVB, which was officially closed on Friday, will gain access to their funds on Monday. SBNY was shuttered just two days after SVB, spurring the Federal Reserve to create a new lending facility for banks to support their liquidity. Financials: Payoneer Global ( NASDAQ: PAYO ), a provider of cloud-based software for financial operations, said it held $20M of its $6.4B cash pile at SVB, as of Dec. 31, 2022, through a combination of cash deposits and money market funds purchased via SVB but managed by a third party asset manager, it said in a recent SEC filing. Financial automation software provider Bill Holdings ( NYSE: BILL ) disclosed that around $300M of its $2.6B of corporate cash is held at SVB, warning ""it is unclear how much of this cash will be unrecoverable"" as a large portion of the corporate deposits are uninsured. In addition, $370M of its cash held in trust on behalf of customers stood were parked at SVB, it said, while noting ""a significant portion will ultimately be recoverable."" Insurtech firm Root, Inc. ( NASDAQ: ROOT ) reported that it maintains ~$1.3M on deposit with SVB, calling it an ""immaterial"" amount of cash relative to its overall cash position. SoFi Technologies ( NASDAQ: SOFI ), known for refinancing student loans, said it does not hold assets with SVB, though it has a ~$40M lending facility that is provided via SVB. Digital marketplace bank LendingClub ( NYSE: LC ) has $21M deposited at SVB, it said in an SEC filing, compared with its $8B of total assets as of Feb. 28. Lemonade ( NYSE: LMND ), another insurtech, said just $7K in cash was held at SVB. Other financial firms that are seeking to capitalize on the failure of SVB and SBNY include Hercules Capital ( NYSE: HTGC ), which has "" earmarked up to $50 million of capital to provide select companies in our ecosystem with secured short-term financing to be able to meet payroll and other related obligations as a result of the closure of SVB,” said Scott Bluestein, the business development company's CEO and chief investment officer. John Marshall Bancorp ( NASDAQ: JMSB ), which serves small to medium-sized businesses, also said it's prepared to get new business from SVB customers. Crypto-related companies: Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner Marathon Digital Holdings ( NASDAQ: MARA ) said Monday it held some $142M of cash deposits at Signature Bridge Bank ( SBNY ) and has access to its funds for treasury management purposes. It has no direct business ties to SVB. Crypto exchange Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ: COIN ) said Sunday it had a cash balance of ~$240M at Signature Bank as of Friday, all of which are expected to be recovered. Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse took to Twitter noting the crypto company has "" some exposure"" to SVB without mentioning how much capital is held at the bank.

42421340,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqrl,1678736379,Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank Reignite ‘Moral Hazard’ Dilemma Bitcoin Was Designed to End,"The events of the past 72 hours should reignite the same intense debates about the U.S. banking system that fed into Bitcoin’s growth after the global financial crisis of 2008. After the closure of three banks that suffered from a combination of mismanagement and bad market conditions, depositors in two of them got what looks an awful lot like a bailout.  It’s actually not a 2008-style bailout, as no taxpayer money is involved (at least not directly). Instead, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) – which is funded by banks themselves rather than taxpayers – chose to designate both Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which followed SVB into receivership on Sunday, as systemic risks.  Read more: George Kaloudis - The Banking Crisis Is Not Crypto’s Fault  That debatable classification conjures another charged term from the mists of crises past: “Too big to fail.”  The designation cleared the way for the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department to backstop all deposits at those banks, instead of limiting protection to the FDIC standard $250,000 per account. Stockholders in the failed banks, on the other hand, will see their equity go to zero, which the Treasury Department points to as another reason this isn’t a “bailout” per se.  The FDIC also announced it will make the backstop mechanism seemingly permanent, with the creation of the new Bank Term Funding Program. The program will offer loans for collateral, including Treasurys. This seems both practical and reasonable because the forced sale of underwater Treasury instruments played a starring role in the collapses of not only SVB and Signature, but also crypto-focused Silvergate Bank, which went under last Wednesday. As many have pointed out, the Federal Reserve’s own aggressive movement on interest rates contributed to the duration mismatch that forced those sales.  In the short term this all adds up to a reasonable-ish middle path between the horns of U.S. banking’s eternal dilemma. On the one hand, we don’t want the kind of emotional and fiscal damage that would result from big losses on boring checking account deposits. On the other hand, backstopping banks too aggressively creates a perverse incentive for them to take big risks, potentially feeding longer-term and more serious instability.  Viewed through a broader and longer-term lens, the balance of the weekend’s events would seem to affirm and even amplify the deeply held anxieties of Bitcoiners: that political influence helps determine who does and doesn’t get help from the Federal Reserve, and that a more neutral monetary system would be better for everyone in the long term.  My upside, your risk  A few details about the backstopping of SVB and Signature deposits could be lost in the coming debate about deposit risk. Perhaps the most important is that Silicon Valley Bank had not only been taking on excess risk with its deposit funds, but had actively angled to avoid rules limiting that exposure. (SVB also made arguably massive errors in strategic communication, but we’ll set that to one side for now.)  Specifically, Silicon Valley Bank was massively overexposed to interest rate risk. A good analysis of this is here from Forbes, but the essence is that SVB was betting against the Fed raising interest rates from their near-zero level early in the COVID-19 crisis. In retrospect, that seems like obviously poor judgment, not just because rate hikes were bound to follow COVID inflation, but because rate hikes had been a looming possibility for years.  The consensus among banking experts seems to lay considerable blame for this and other poor choices at the feet of SVB management. As Andy Kessler made the case in the Wall Street Journal, “The bear market started in January 2022, 14 months ago. Surely it shouldn’t have taken more than a year for management at SVB to figure out that credit would tighten and the [initial public offering] market would dry up.”  But there’s an even stronger case for that responsibility than 20/20 hindsight: Silicon Valley Bank also took proactive steps to avoid or rescind rules that would have forced it to take fewer risks. As detailed by the New York Times, Silicon Valley Bank CEO Greg Becker was an advocate for Trump administration rollbacks of certain stress-test and liquidity requirements for mid-sized banks like his.  When things turn, the same big players use their influence to get others to absorb the damage.  While it’s unclear whether this was a direct factor in SVB’s unwind, it reinforces the perception that this is a replay of the same risk socialization that, in various forms, continues to feed American inequality. Rich, powerful people and institutions love to push back against government controls that prevent them from taking profitable risks when times are good. Then, when things turn, the same big players use their influence to get others to absorb the damage – influence often supported by the very same funds accumulated during high-risk periods.  The other thing almost certain to be lost in the shuffle is that even without the new backstop, SVB and Signature depositors would likely have been largely OK. In a normal bank failure, the FDIC oversees the sale of the illiquid bank. Depositors in this scenario can take a haircut, perhaps losing 10%-15% of their deposit value over the $250,000 FDIC insurance threshold. On Sunday morning before the backstop announcement, Bloomberg sources said 30%-50% of uninsured SVB deposits would be available Monday, with the rest available over time. (SVB was CoinDesk's bank.)  It’s possible, though, that the FDIC couldn’t find a buyer for SVB, and/or didn’t see one on the horizon for Signature. The auction for SVB started Saturday night and was expected to resolve by Sunday, but instead we got the backstop announcement. If it’s true that nobody wanted to buy SVB at any price, there might be even more reason to worry about the next few weeks – but also that much less justification for backstopping the bad decisions that left it worthless as an enterprise.  All in the panic room  Finally, any moral assessment of this moment must reckon with the panicky and arguably malevolent behavior of some of Silicon Valley’s biggest names.  As soon as Silicon Valley Bank was shuttered Friday, prominent voices in the venture capital world began explicitly demanding that all uninsured deposits be guaranteed by the government. If SVB wasn’t “bailed out,” these figures warned in dire, panicky terms, there would be a nationwide bank run, decimating mid-sized and community banks across the U.S.  Notably, these commenters largely ignored the existence of a receivership process, and went straight to demanding a “bailout” that would make all uninsured deposits whole. This included David Sacks and Jason Calacanis, prominent tech investors and co-hosts of the “All In” podcast. Some of Sacks’ foreboding tweets were so unconsidered that Twitter users flagged them with fact checks.  Calacanis’ behavior was even more deranged. On Twitter he posted images from the film “Mad Max: Fury Road,” while exhorting his more than 690,000 followers to stock up on food and fuel. By early Monday, Calacanis had deleted many of these tweets.  This theatrical tearing of hair arguably fueled the very panic Calacanis and Sacks were warning of – and did so by design. At worst, these inverse Cassandras were little more than rhetorical terrorists, using their massive platforms and the trust placed in them by still all-too-credulous Americans to stoke fear. At the very least, their behavior increased pressure on the Fed to quiet the fears they were feeding as much as warning about.  And they got what they wanted! So hooray for them, I guess. Now it’s an even more embedded doctrine of U.S. banking policy that you can deposit your funds with a bank with bad risk management, but if you have enough Twitter followers or other influence you’ll get it back no matter what.  Surely, that can’t lead to anything bad. Right?",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,David Z.

Finishing the trifecta of bank collapses, New York-based Signature Bank – a former crypto-friendly institution that began limiting industry exposure last year – was shut down by state regulators on March 12 in order “to protect depositors.”  According to the Form ADV Filing dated May 11, 2022, the BlockTower Blue Signum SPV fund, which had about $4.6 million in gross asset value at the time of the filing, used Silvergate Bank as its sole custodian. The BlockTower DeFi SPV I fund ($74.6 million in gross assets) also listed only Silvergate, while the BlockTower Gamma Point Master Fund ($89 million) had Signature Bank as the custodian.  BlockTower Capital Partners Master Fund ($770.5 million in gross assets) was the most diversified, listing five custodians: Silvergate, Signature Bank, the trust services of Anchorage Digital and Coinbase, and Celadon Financial Group.  The date on the filing means that BlockTower Capital could have moved to different custodians in the interim. CoinDesk reached out to BlockTower for comment but had not received a response by publication time.

42393754,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpA1f9,1678735306,Is This a Crypto Banking Bailout?,"As the wreckage that started inside crypto banking threatens financial institutions beyond the sector’s border, the U.S. government is eager to make it clear that it’s not going to let the situation get out of hand.  But is it a bailout?  “I instructed my team to act quickly,” President Joe Biden said on Monday, saying the Treasury Department and banking regulators took immediate action to protect depositors. “We will not stop at this. We’ll do whatever is needed.”  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) took over Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank and exerted special powers to declare all of the customer money in the busted banks is newly sheathed in government guarantees. The Federal Reserve triggered its emergency authority to extend help to banks by offering one-year loans to back up their deposits.  Just days after the collapse of crypto-focused Silvergate Bank, the government has aggressively backstopped the banking industry, though Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was careful to push back on some of the bailout rhetoric raging in Twitter discussions. She said over the weekend the federal government can’t return to its pre-2008 playbook.  When a toxic soup of mortgage securities and derivatives choked the global financial system at that time, the government made hundreds of billions of dollars in direct infusions into the banking system, and took a number of other measures to prop up the lenders. That help was ultimately paid for by taxpayers.  That’s not what’s happening here, so far.  Under federal law, federal authorities can declare a “systemic risk exception” when they agree the implosion of an institution may endanger the financial system. The Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and FDIC invoked that exception for SVB and Signature, after consulting with Biden.  The FDIC is guaranteeing all deposits at both banks – beyond the $250,000 limit the agency’s insurance fund usually protects. If the lenders’ own assets end up being insufficient to cover that cost, anything extra will come out of the FDIC’s fund, which is paid for by assessments on the banking industry.  The FDIC has used its deposit insurance to help prop up banking more widely in the past, when it temporarily moved to increase its coverage from $100,000 in deposits to $250,000 during the 2008 crisis. It later made that new level permanent. But this current move is just for the two named banks.  Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is giving out its one-year loans to banks, letting them pledge Treasurys and other high-quality assets at face value. So if a bank needs cash quickly to pay for customer withdrawals, it won’t have to race out and sell assets at a loss. The Fed isn’t funded by federal appropriations, so this program won’t directly come out of taxpayer pockets, either.  “No losses will be borne by the taxpayers,” Biden said  Moral hazard  The U.S. Government Accountability Office warned back in 2010 about “moral hazard” concerns after the regulators intervened with Wachovia and Citigroup.  “Regulators’ use of the systemic risk exception may weaken market participants’ incentives to properly manage risk if they come to expect similar emergency actions in the future,” the GAO concluded in a report months before the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act that overhauled U.S. financial regulation.  “The lessons and scars of the global financial crisis loom heavily on regulators' minds as they put together the rescue plan this weekend,” said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center. “The clear emphasis that this not a taxpayer bailout – and instead that the banks will pay for it – is a shift from the crises of the past decade.”  Dodd-Frank – co-authored by then-House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, who joined the board of Signature Bank after he left Congress – insisted the Fed shouldn’t be allowed to rescue individual companies, so the post-crisis regulations only allow the central bank to weigh in with wide-ranging help. Hence, a lending facility for everybody.  “The fact that finance departments in companies all around the country had digested what it meant for SVB to fail and had already acted meant that there was imminent nationwide risk,” according to an assessment circulated by Beacon Policy Advisors, a research firm in Washington, D.C. At that point, as companies began moving money out of regional and community banks, the government needed to boost confidence in those institutions and “avoid the risk of a cascade of failures.”  Government takeover  This is not an injection of cash into crypto-tied institutions, allowing them to continue doing business as usual. It’s more like a government takeover that’s imposing new management on the banks.  And it’s not even cut-and-dry the banks that have so far collapsed were crypto banks. Silvergate was focused on digital assets, but Silicon Valley Bank was a crypto-friendly institution more famous as a backer of many tech startups. Signature Bank may have dipped heavily into the sector, but since last year it was quickly trying to shed many of those connections.  The term “bailout” has difficult connotations in finance, and especially in crypto. The 2009 origin story of Bitcoin is rooted in criticism of the bailout of banks.  The pushback against the description was echoed at the state level on Monday, when New York Department of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne Harris addressed her state’s shutdown of Signature.  “This is not a bailout,” she said. “We moved quickly to make sure depositors were protected.”  UPDATE (March 13, 2023, 20:48 UTC): Adds comment from Josh Lipsky.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/13/is-this-a-crypto-banking-bailout,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9f24b34dcb0f45b5d5affae860eb4d7c5eba4321-4306x2422.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Circle Internet Financial’s USDC stablecoin had almost $3 billion in net redemptions, defined as the total number of USDC burned minus the number of USDC minted between March 10 and press time Monday, per on-chain data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen. Over the same time period, the total supply of DAI increased by 1.2 billion tokens, according to a Makerburn dashboard for DAI minting.  As a result, USDC’s market capitalization dropped 10%, from $43.5 billion on Friday to roughly $39.5 billion Monday, while DAI’s market capitalization increased nearly 29%, per CoinGecko.  On Friday, March 10, SVB was shut down by state regulators, causing widespread financial chaos in the banking industry that has bled into the crypto ecosystem. Among the impacted was Circle, which had $3.3 billion in cash deposits at SVB, and MakerDAO, which uses USDC to generate its alternative stablecoin DAI.  The following day, crypto users sent $1.2 billion to both MakerDAO and Circle’s burn address, Nansen data shows. Burns are indicative of USDC holders redeeming their tokens for cash.  The mass burn reversed Circle’s early March trend where it had been minting more USDC than it was destroying. Between March 1 and March 9, Circle minted a net average of $143 million USDC a day, but this trend has since changed: Starting on March 10, Circle has burned a daily net average of $727 million.  Additionally, Nansen data shows that MakerDAO’s Peg Stability Module, a smart contract that holds assets like USDC to back the value of DAI, saw a 91% increase in USDC deposits, jumping to $4.1 billion today from $2.1 billion on March 10.  The MakerDAO community is currently considering a governance proposal that would pause swaps in its Peg Stability Module that would freeze the token purchases needed to mint new DAI tokens.  Currently, USDC makes up 63.1% of the collateral used to generate all DAI in circulation, according to a DAI Stats dashboard.",NEUTRAL,DAI | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MKR | DAI | USDC,Sage D.

42394486,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw8L4j,1678733805,What Are MoonCats? The Legacy NFT Project Revived by Its Community,"Project name: MoonCats  Project type: Generative art  Original mint date: August 9, 2017  Original mint price: free (only required to pay gas fees)  Runs on: Ethereum  Highest sale to date: MoonCat #527 sold for 160 ETH (approximately $524,000 at the time) on August 27, 2021.  What are MoonCats?  MoonCats is a non-fungible token (NFT) collection of 25,440 generative pixel art-style cats. It is considered to be one of the earliest NFT projects. It was created on Aug. 9, 2017, by Ponderware, a tech duo made up of Ethereum enthusiasts.  David, one of the project’s founders, said on Kevin Rose’s ""Proof"" podcast that he and his co-founder Jason were inspired by the potential and seemingly limitless possibilities of smart contracts. “Moon, cats, the internet – it just all sort of came together.”  According to MoonCatRescue's website, the lore centers on an ""insanely cute operation"" to save the cats from an imminent solar eclipse that threatened their existence.  Typically, generative NFT collections reveal the artwork to holders only after minting. MoonCats, however, gave collectors the ability to customize their cats before minting.  “One of our shared design goals … is empowering people, and that’s why it has a very fair distribution. We wanted people to choose which cats they got, and we wanted people to be able to customize them,” Jason said on the ""Proof"" podcast.  Though the project was initially successful, not all of the MoonCats were minted, and interest in the project eventually faded. In March 2021, a group of crypto historians rediscovered the project, which inspired other NFT collectors to mint the remaining MoonCats.  After all of the cats were minted, the project’s founders re-engaged with the community.  In total, there are 96 black and white “Genesis Cats” and 25,344 “Rescue Cats” that are colorful. Because of the limited supply, Genesis Cats are priced higher on the secondary market. Cats that were minted earlier are also considered more valuable.  The original collection contract used the ERC-20 token standard, though most NFTs have since adopted the ERC-721 token standard. In order to build out the MoonCats ecosystem, the project developers built “The Acclimator,” which allowed holders to choose to wrap their assets. Doing so gives their tokens full ERC-721 and ERC-998 functionality and makes them compatible with secondary marketplaces like OpenSea.  MoonCats are stored entirely on the Ethereum blockchain, and so the project doesn't rely on external services like IPFS to store the data and visuals.  Where can I buy MoonCats?  Collectors were able to mint a MoonCat for free, minus the cost of gas, on the MoonCat Rescue site.  The collection is available for purchase on secondary marketplaces like OpenSea. Because of the Acclimator and process of wrapping the assets, there are two categories of MoonCats listed for sale:  Acclimated MoonCats (Acclimated):  Official Wrapped MoonCats (Acclimated) are NFTs that have been migrated to the ERC-721 standard. As of March 2023, more than 19,400 Acclimated MoonCats have been created.  Unwrapped MoonCats:  Original MoonCats created on the ERC-20 standard can be traded through the official MoonCats adoption center.  A buying guide has been published on the official MoonCats Community medium account to understand the rarity traits and ecosystem.  What is the project’s utility?  Beyond owning one of the earliest NFT projects, holders can also choose to further customize their MoonCats with accessories that will be included with the cat every time it changes hands. Creators and designers can also customize and upload their accessories to sell on the MoonCat Boutique website.  MoonCat holders can also use several applications to expand their NFT utility: Isotile lets users create a virtual room where MoonCats can be generated as animated voxel characters, while Worldwide Webb is an online cyberpunk-style world where MoonCats can be uploaded.  In October 2021, Sotheby's auctioned off three MoonCats, further creating buzz around the project.  Offshoot projects  The Photobooth allows MoonCat owners to create various images with their NFTs and associated accessories. The team also created Lootprints, which are the plans for a MoonCat spaceship and which were available to holders as a free mint in September 2021. According to the team, Lootprints will eventually transform into full spaceships and will be integrated into future MoonCat projects.  MoonCatPop is an official derivative of MoonCats and was released as a joint project between Ponderware and the MoonCat community. A maximum of 256 virtual Vending Machine NFTs, each with a specific flavor and MoonCat image, were designed.  Playing off of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) launched in May 2017, the MoonCat Name Service (MCNS) is a free feature and domain for all MoonCat owners that comes attached to their MoonCat's mint ID and hex.  What do we know about the MoonCats team?  Ponderware started as a team of two and has since expanded. The intellectual property behind the project was sold internally for an undisclosed amount in September 2022.  Ponderware and MoonCats have since separated into two business entities, with the former continuing to work on technical consulting and their respective creative projects.  A Rug Radio Twitter Space on Sept. 8, 2022 clarified how ownership of MoonCats will unfold. As of Sept. 6 2022, ownership of the MoonCats project was transferred to pseudonymous Ponderware team members. Lead developer MidnightLightning and community manager Paws. Some former Ponderware staff members have stayed on the MoonCats team as volunteers.  What intellectual property rights do holders have?  According to the MoonCats Community website, MoonCatsRescue LLC, the company behind the project, “owns all legal right, title and interest in and to the MoonCatArt, and all intellectual property rights therein.” Holders are granted commercial rights to use the image of their MoonCat and to create derivative work based on their MoonCat. However, MoonCatRescue LLC retains ownership of all derivative works.  MoonCats future plans  The MoonCats community has published a road map with its future long- and-short-term plans, including the expansion of ""The JumpPort"" to allow MoonCats to interact with layer 2 blockchains and be used for staking.  There are also plans to make MoonCats interoperable in different metaverse worlds, and a mysterious project called ""GravBalls"" promises an ""’idle’-style game, where human owners have some influence over the game's outcome in the setup and entering of their MoonCats into the game.",POSITIVE,ETH | ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING | ENS,Mason Marcobello,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-are-mooncats-the-legacy-nft-project-revived-by-its-community,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e43371137f4492c43beae5a7114df7f6eddca07d-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421337,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqof,1678728844,The Banking Crisis Is Not Crypto’s Fault,"Silvergate Bank voluntarily wound down on March 8 ($12 billion in assets), Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) went into FDIC receivership on March 10 ($200 billion in assets), Signature Bank was shut down by state regulators on March 12 ($100 billion in assets).  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  All these banks serviced some crypto clients. Some serviced more than others. Silvergate, in particular, banked several crypto exchanges and operated a 24/7 instant settlement network among Silvergate clients. The collapse of FTX weighed on Silvergate, and a scathing letter sent by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to the bank’s executives late last year partially weakened public perception of the bank. The Biden administration also voiced concerns.  So Silvergate was run into the ground by a classic bank run that was at least partially encouraged by the U.S. government and not because of crypto (even if Senator Warren maintains it was). Especially when you consider that, in the end, Silvergate’s liquidation was voluntary and its plan includes a “full repayment of all deposits.”  Shortly after Silvergate, SVB was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) following an old-fashioned bank run. The bank run was spurred on both by SVB mismanaging risk, losing money by putting customer deposits in the wrong financial securities (like long-dated Treasurys or the wrong flavor of mortgage backed securities) and by fear stoked by the venture capitalists who own massive financial interests in many of the companies banked by SVB.  Adding more kindling to the SVB fire – Reuters reported over the weekend that credit rating agency Moody’s was preparing to downgrade SVB’s credit rating, which potentially drove SVB to manage risk like this. On the downgrade news, SVB reportedly looked to Goldman Sachs for advice.  SVB subsequently sold $20 billion of bonds over a weekend, which generated a loss, and then aimed to fill that hole by raising equity capital. That equity raise failed and now SVB no longer exists. (This is starting to smell like 2007, isn’t it?)  Do note, though, that SVB is more dependent on Silicon Valley startups than it is on crypto companies.  Now, on Sunday, we had Signature shut down by state regulators. Signature is viewed as another crypto-friendly bank as Silvergate was. We’ve seen Barney Frank – yes, the Frank in Dodd-Frank – come out and say that clients may have overestimated Signature’s exposure to crypto. Frank knows this because, and I cannot believe this is true, he is a board member at Signature.  See also: Crypto's Banking Problem Is Not Ironic | The Node  Frank also adds that Signature could have remained a going concern. Obviously regulators disagreed after customers withdrew more than $10 billion of deposits on Friday and Signature was taken over by the FDIC on Sunday.  Crypto outcry  Setting aside Silvergate for a moment because, let’s face it, it’s far less of a systemic risk to the broader banking system than SVB and Signature are (it is much smaller and it didn’t get a government backstop), there is a very interesting thing that ties SVB and Signature together: Media outlets and general outcry blames crypto for these bank failures.  That is simply not true.  Even Barney Frank suggested that it wasn’t necessarily a crypto problem but a messaging about a crypto problem. He told CNBC: “I think part of what happened was that regulators wanted to send a very strong anti-crypto message...We became the poster boy because there was no insolvency based on the fundamentals.""  Each of these failures is the result of poor risk management of customer deposits and a subsequent bank run. Taking one step back, suggesting that a single asset class, whose companies have issues getting banking services in the first place, would be able to take down the banking system on its own is patently absurd.

42387920,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQyLhB,1678727931,MakerDAO Weighs Using Emergency Switch to Prevent Future DAI Depegging,"The community behind MakerDAO, the issuer of the $6.3 billion market cap DAI stablecoin, is considering emergency measures to protect DAI from slipping beneath the dollar mark as a nationwide banking crisis threatens crypto.  Under the proposal, the community would adopt an emergency switch that would pause peg-stability-module (PSM) swaps on its protocol, freezing the token purchases required to mint new DAI tokens, Sam MacPherson, a protocol engineer at MakerDAO, told CoinDesk.  “That [PSM pause] would prevent DAI from following the price of any depegging stablecoin,” MacPherson said.  The proposal comes just two days after DAI, a so-called decentralized stablecoin backed by many assets including USDC, fell to an all-time low of 88 cents. DAI’s depegging occurred after Circle, the issuer of USD coin (USDC), revealed it had billions of dollars of its stablecoin’s collateral at the failed Silicon Valley Bank, sending the price of USDC tumbling. On Monday, USDC regained its dollar peg.  DAI’s reliance on USDC for roughly 52% percent of its reserves rendered it vulnerable to losing its dollar peg. The protocol uses PSM swaps, a vault that permits users to “swap a given collateral type directly for DAI at a fixed rate, rather than borrowing DAI,” according to MakerDAO.  The emergency measure would allow the protocol to circumvent its normal 16-hour waiting period, which was already shortened from two days, on freezing PSM swaps, intended to allow DAI’s issuer to act swiftly enough to prevent the token’s price from following in the same direction as other stablecoins such as USDC. It's not clear how much time it would take for DAI to begin depegging if one of the tokens by which it is collateralized starts depegging.  The pause switch for PSM swaps isn’t automatically triggered when one of the assets that backs DAI begins depegging, so the MakerDAO community would have to vote to use the tool.  “The TLDR is that an emergency switch is being added to pause PSM swaps. Normally there is a two-day delay on any action, so this bypasses that delay,” MacPherson said in a Telegram message. “It’s not being planned to be used, but it’s there if governance needs.”  Read more: MakerDAO Founder Calls for Rebranding of DAI Stablecoin",NEGATIVE,DAI | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | MKR | TRADING | DAI | USDC,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/13/makerdao-weighs-using-emergency-switch-to-prevent-future-dai-depegging,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18ef337a31bd946b429e310d0344f3ee8dfabdd1-2560x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite the revival, ""we see potential incremental risks to USDC itself, as the de-pegging experienced over the last few days could impact overall demand for USDC, which would be a negative for Coinbase’s P&L,"" analyst Benjamin Budish wrote in a March 12 note. In Q4, Coinbase ( COIN ) generated $146M of interest income from USDC ( USDC-USD ), representing around 23% of its total sales and ~27% of gross profit, he noted. In the meantime, COIN climbed 9.6% as bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) shot up some 17% to around $24K.

42421343,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqur,1678725540,Fan Tokens: A Bet on Your Favorite Soccer Team?,"During last year’s World Cup, the crypto world saw the re-emergence of an almost forgotten trend: soccer fan tokens. Sorry – football (for you non-U.S. readers) fan tokens, a concept started by blockchain provider Chiliz back in 2021. At the tail end of 2022, while a major crypto exchange was collapsing and much of the crypto market was eroding, some national team fan tokens saw moves in excess of 500%. It was the perfect intersection of rabid football fandom and supercharged crypto speculation.  Crypto ages in dog years and so it already feels like eons ago. But have a look at any national team fan token during the World Cup, such as Brazil (BFT), the odds-on favorites at the start of the tournament, or Argentina (ARG), the winners, and you’ll be reminded of just how fast these things flew – and subsequently flopped. That was not entirely unexpected. For a tournament that comes around only once every four years, it’s impossible to maintain that same fervor for your national team once the dust has settled and the pitch is baked by the Qatari desert sun.  This feature is part of CoinDesk's Culture Week.  Instead, we will have a look at various club-level teams and their fan tokens: in particular FC Barcelona (BAR), Arsenal (AFC), Manchester City (CITY) and Paris Saint Germain (PSG). There are currently about 80 fan tokens under the Chiliz/Socios banner. Between league matches and various tournaments, club teams play almost year-round, taking just a few weeks off in the summer. As such, these club tokens offer the opportunity to do some analysis into what effect, if any, a team’s weekly performance may have on the tokens themselves.  The first of these fan tokens were launched in 2021 on a platform called Socios, a social network powered by Chiliz. Chiliz is a crypto protocol in the CoinDesk Culture & Entertainment Sector. Culture & Entertainment (CNE) is one of the seven sectors in the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS). CNE represents the collection of projects whose aim is to decentralize social media, create decentralized gaming worlds and empower direct peer-to-peer interaction between content creators and their audience.  Through their fan tokens, Chiliz is ushering in a new era of supporter-team engagement. On the back of that success, as CoinDesk recently reported, Chiliz has set up a $50 million program to invest in new sports-themed Web3 projects. Through Socios.com, these fan tokens allow supporters to vote on various team decisions and can even grant certain VIP perks as a reward for active participation. Fans can now feel they have actual skin in the game, that they are “invested” in their teams. But are they?  As things currently stand, the top football fan tokens by market cap just happen to be the top teams in each of their respective leagues: FC Barcelona, Paris Saint Germain and Arsenal all have sizable leads two-thirds into the season. At a glance, we might conclude that their positions atop the fan token market cap list are a result of their success on the pitch this season. But there could be numerous factors at play. Are these tokens correlating highly with their Sector, Culture & Entertainment (CNE)? Or is their performance merely a function of their perpetual popularity as compared to smaller teams? Let’s dive in.  First, we look at each token’s daily market capitalization performance and compare it to the sector in which it resides: Culture & Entertainment (CNE). CNE launched at the end of August 2022, so we will adjust the start date of everything to 8/28/22. By looking at market cap rather than price we can correct for the supply values that have increased over time, which gives a more accurate representation of overall enthusiasm for these tokens. In the following chart, we can see there is some clear correlation across tokens. Particularly notable is FTX’s collapse in November 2022, which sent the whole market downward.  Read more: 4th Quarter Market Outlook: The CoinDesk Digitization Index (DTZ)  Next, we will examine the sector-adjusted performance to get a better sense of how these tokens stack up against one another. Below, we can see that highly correlated moves like the FTX collapse have been mostly eliminated with this sector adjustment. In theory we’ve removed the broader “Culture & Entertainment” sector effect from these tokens’ performance. Here is where things become interesting. Manchester City and Paris Saint Germain have barely budged. Meanwhile, Barcelona is up nearly 250% and Arsenal has done even better at almost 300%.  These teams are all at the top positions in their respective leagues. But two have moved imperceptibly in terms of market cap, and two have more than doubled on a sector-adjusted basis. What’s causing the difference?  With a little more context, the explanation is clear: Arsenal and Barcelona are making comebacks. The other teams mentioned are proven winners – PSG and Man City are reigning league champions in France and England. It’s priced in. Not only that, but looking at league competition Manchester City has won four of the last five seasons; Paris Saint Germain has won eight of the last 10, and even Barcelona, whose legacy speaks for itself, has won 10 out of the last 20, although it hasn’t finished first since 2018-2019. On the other hand, Arsenal has been a top team for decades, though it hasn’t won the Premier League since the days of “The Invincibles” days of 2003-2004.  While these fan tokens offer various perks, they may also present the opportunity to speculate on the next rising star. Is buying your favorite team’s fan token an investment in the team’s success? Probably not. But if some epic underdog suddenly breaks out into the top of the league, you might be surprised.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,"Max Good, Todd Groth",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/13/fan-tokens-cryptocurrency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/caa09f6a34a69424a7992f01463ccee750233cd8-3784x2129.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Most see the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) and Federal Reserve's actions as helping to calm investors' fears. Increased banking regulation is expected, especially for smaller banks, and some asset classes are likely to benefit. The spillover of Silicon Valley Bank's failure is relatively contained so far, according to Deutsche Bank's DWS CIO View note. But it can manifest itself in four steps: first, the direct effect of the SVB bankruptcy and FDIC receivership, which has already occurred; second-order effect through the behavior of clients that hold uninsured deposits at other banks; third is spillover to vulnerable companies with weak balance sheets, such such as those issuing high yield, companies in the startup sector, or those related to crypto assets; and fourth, mass liquidations in market and widespread contagion. Stemming contagion The failure of Signature Bank ( SBNY ) is the first victim of the second-order effects, the note said. The U.S. banking regulators' actions announced on Sunday are ""the first steps to restore confidence and avoid mass withdrawals of deposits,"" DWS said. TD Securities analyst Priya Misra calls the Federal Reserve's new Bank Term Funding Program ""a great comfort."" BTIG's Isaac Boltansky agreed, ""We believe this facility will meaningfully lessen liquidity pressure in the near term, but it should not be viewed as a panacea given preexisting asset-liability mismatches on bank balance sheets."" He also is interested to see the reporting requirements for the BTFP, as there could be ""stigma associated with tapping the facility."" In addition, ""there is still work to be done to address the problems that led to this weekend's developments."" Less constructive on U.S. structured finance As a result of the market turmoil, DWS downgraded its view on U.S. structured finance to Neutral, ""as we believe the market will be jittery and in cash-preservation mode for some time."" SVB isn't a large holder of non-agency structured finance, but is ""heavy in agency CMBS and MBS."" Considering the likely slower pace of Fed rate hikes, DWS expects the dollar to weaken ""a bit"" against the euro, but sees no major moves. The firm is still ""fundamentally positive"" on the European banking sector. In the U.S. banking sector, smaller banks will be at a disadvantage in the fight for saver deposits, which is likely to intensify. Small banks, too, are important players in real estate financing and development. If the recent events lead to decreased lending in that sector, the lower supply could raise real-estate valuations. But if startups go out of business, the supply of commercial real estate would increase, DWS said. Tighter rules J.P. Morgan credit analyst Kabir Caprihan said, ""It has become pretty evident that regulation at smaller regional banks will need to become more stringent....We would hope this experience would imply a quick decision on regional bank TLAC (total loss-absorbing capacity) and it should be expanded towards category 4 and other firms,"" the analyst wrote. They're also likely to face stricter LCR (liquidity coverage ratio) and other liquidity rules like global systemically important (GSIBs) banks. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg wondered if regulators could limit deposit concentrations by sector as they have already done so on the loan side. Another area he advises to watch is disclosures on held-to-maturity securities. ""Only Category I and II (the largest banks) have to include unrealized AFS (available for sale) losses in their CET1 ratios while the HTM is completely ignored for all banks,"" he wrote. In Global Financials Sector Specialized commentary, J.P. Morgan's Gigi Sparling reiterates the firm's constructive view of large cap banks due to their relative high proportion of insured deposits and ""robustly stressed balance sheet."" Private credit players also could benefit from decreased bank lending activity, DWS said. TD's Misra expects banking lending standards ""to worsen further, adding to downside risks."" The firm remains long on 10s, expects a 25-basis point Fed rate hike in March and a terminal rate of 5.75%. ""The 5y sector should outperform on the curve and swaps should outperform Treasuries (ie tighter swap spreads). TIPS BE should fall, but we think front end BE should be more anchored due to high carry,"" TD's Misra wrote. Moral hazard While regulators' actions are meant to contain contagion risks at other banks, J.P. Morgan analyst Vivek Juneja pointed out: ""This has created a moral hazard for the Fed; there will be an expectation for it to step in even if a bank gets in trouble in the future for any other issues."" SA contributor Richard Shaw says there's a ""risky decision to be made about the choice of money funds"" and the Silicon Valley Bank failure has created some valuable stock entry values.

The cryptocurrency, which was recently trading above $24,200, registered its largest daily increase in almost a month, according to data from TradingView. Earlier Monday, bitcoin reached a daily high of about $24,500.  The reasons for the upturn are still unclear, particularly as cryptos often decline during periods of unrest in financial markets. But the surge has come amid the sort of short squeeze that historically sends prices higher. Data from Coinglass shows that traders liquidated $300 million worth of crypto positions on Monday. A full $140 million worth of these liquidations were bitcoin liquidations, with $160 million in short positions.  The bitcoin rally comes as some investors are recognizing the fragility in the central banking system, according to Sean Farrell, head of digital-asset strategy at FundStrat.  “Bitcoin is leading the market because there is a cohort of investors that recognize the fragility of central banking and the solutions BTC offers,” Farrell said.  “Crypto is responding to the anticipated change in liquidity conditions as it should,” he added.  Risky assets surged on Monday after U.S. regulators said on Sunday they would create a deposit insurance national bank to protect insured depositors of Silicon Valley Bank.  “This is where the market believes now that the rails between crypto and TradFi have disappeared, hence we see traders buying what is left of the market and willing to pay a premium,” said Laurent Kssis, crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital.

42421329,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqhR,1678721289,Move-to-Earn Has a Ponzi-Economics Problem,"In 2022, Stepn emerged as one of the darlings of the crypto industry. First built as part of a Solana hackathon at the end of 2021, Stepn requires users to give the app access to their GPS and movement data from their smartphones and then rewards users with the GST token for walking and running. Stepn went through a meteoric rise as the poster child for the move-to-earn industry. To wit, Stepn reported a $23 million profit for the second quarter last year just seven months after it released a test version of its app.  Read more: Boyd Cohen is CEO and co-founder of Iomob, the developers of WheelCoin, a Move2Earn game that rewards users for moving green. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Culture Week.  The move-to-earn, or M2E, concept is based on play-to-earn mechanics. Instead of playing games from your home computer or on your phone to earn tokens as you progress through a game, M2E seeks to “gamify” the physical movement of users.  The value of the M2E sector rose to more than $1 billion last May based on the aggregated value of the tokens of its top projects. Now, as I write this op-ed, that same basket of tokens is worth only $273 million. Of course, the whole crypto industry has suffered a lot since the 2021 bull market, but the M2E sector has also been hit hard, and perhaps Stepn more than most.  Stepn has been widely accused of being too reliant on Ponzi economics. The argument has been that M2E games, like many play-to-earn games, rely too much on unlimited user growth that can never be sustained and on users spending money on in-game assets like NFTs to increase their reward-token earnings potential.  Earning more tokens and acquiring more non-fungible tokens supposedly leads to users becoming rich. In the heyday of play-to-earn, users indeed were able to earn insane amounts of high-value tokens. One user, for example, reported earning an average fiat-converted token income of $350 a day just from walking.  SweatCoin’s story  There are dozens or more M2E games in the market now, such as Walken and GenoPets. Most of them rely on somewhat similar mechanics. A definite outlier is SweatCoin.  SweatCoin’s journey is unique in that it was founded in 2014, and although the founders had aspirations to bring the reward token on-chain back then, they knew it was way too early, and so it remained a Web2 app. And thanks to great execution and brand building, SweatCoin had more than 100 million users before it was deployed on the Near protocol last year.  The partnership between Near and SweatCoin was mutually beneficial. The SweatCoin deployment on Near is widely accepted to be the main driver for the number of Near wallets going from 2 million at the start of 2022 to 20 million by November 2022.  Because SweatCoin survived close to a decade without having digital assets like NFTs or a reward token on-chain, it was forced to build a business model that didn’t rely on them. Not surprisingly, in private conversations with several blockchain developers for the M2E project I lead, WheelCoin, I learned that there had been a bit of a bidding war among several leading blockchains to bring SweatCoin to their ecosystem.  Because of its origin story, SweatCoin built a business model that looks a lot like a Web2 business that is able to capture tens of millions of users. The SweatCoin team monetized its engaged-user base through a combination of in-app advertising and sponsorships. The latter appealed to fitness brands willing to pay SweatCoin for the right to offer discounts to users with an obvious interest in fitness.  Thus, by not having the ability to monetize digital assets the way crypto-native M2E apps have done, SweatCoin built what I believe to be a much more sustainable business model. With the transition to Web3, SweatCoin hasn’t lost its roots, but instead is now layering in more on-chain digital assets, including the reward token itself. This source estimates SweatCoin to have $20 million in annual revenue from its advertising and sponsorship business model.  A business model to emulate  While building WheelCoin, my team reviewed all of these different business models and approaches to community building and monetization. We leaned much more heavily on the SweatCoin business model than Stepn’s, and I believe that future M2E projects will do so as well. You may ask why would we do that when Stepn had more than $120 million in profit in one quarter while SweatCoin likely earns way less than that annually?  Providing in-real-life, or IRL, utility for the reward token, such as discounts on products and services the community is likely to value, creates a viable path to long-term sustained growth and success for move-to-earn apps.  Note, while I used the business model of Stepn to juxtapose with SweatCoin’s, the team behind Stepn has said in interviews that it is focused on reducing the Ponzi nature of its core business while also diversifying its product offerings, including leveraging its massive user base to deploy a decentralized crypto exchange called DOOAR, which quickly became the largest DEX, in the Solana ecosystem.  As many project 2023 to be the year that crypto starts to go more mainstream by connecting with the real world, I am convinced move-to-earn apps will also succeed this year, if and only if it manages to connect to real-world ecosystems and creates off-chain utility for its reward tokens.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | NEAR,Boyd Cohen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/13/move-to-earn-has-a-ponzi-problem-culture-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aff55312dd727dd0881faec078c025e158afaf3f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Markus Ferber, a German who represents the leading center-right party in the European Parliament, said EU bank supervisors should check if European lenders could be vulnerable to interest rate shocks similar to those that felled the California bank on Friday.  “The name of the game is containment now,” Ferber said in an emailed statement. “Panic is infectious and must not be allowed to spread.”  Ferber also called for a rethink of how sovereign bonds are treated under bank-capital rules, a regular theme from German politicians who argue current rules understate the risk of indebted governments such as Italy and Greece.  EU policy makers have sought to play down fears of contagion. A European Commission spokesperson on Monday said SVB had only a ""very limited presence"" within the bloc, and French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters banks in the country were ""not exposed"" and had different business models to SVB's.  Market jitters have nonetheless spread to the region. The Stoxx 600 Europe Bank Index, which includes lenders based outside the euro zone, fell 6.3%, the largest one-day slide in over a year, according to Reuters.

In remarks from the White House on Monday, Biden said the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act signed into law under former President Barack Obama (when Biden was vice president) created “tough requirements” for banks, which were subsequently weakened under the administration of former President Donald Trump.  The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Treasury Department announced Sunday that they would ensure depositors in the failed banks would be made whole.  Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank – with $209 billion and $110 billion in assets, respectively – mark two of the three biggest bank collapses in U.S. history, and both happened within days of each other. The largest collapse was Washington Mutual Bank, which failed during the Great Financial Crisis of 2008.  “We must get the full accounting of what happened and why those responsible can be held accountable,” Biden said. “In my administration, no one – no one is above the law. And finally, we must reduce the risk of this happening again. During the Obama-Biden administration, we put in place tough requirements on banks, like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, including the Dodd-Frank law to make sure that the crisis we saw in 2008 would not happen again.”  While the banks’ depositors will have access to all of their funds, senior management was removed, the federal banking regulators and Treasury Department said in their joint statement Sunday. Biden alluded to this in his remarks, saying the people running a bank taken over by the FDIC should no longer work there.  “Investors in the banks will not be protected,” he added. “They knowingly took a risk. And when the risk didn't pay off, investors lose their money. That's how capitalism works.”  The president also said taxpayers would not be responsible for the cost of bailing out the two lenders; instead, the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund would be replenished with fees on banks.  New York Governor Kathy Hochul and New York Department of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne Harris, who also spoke Monday following their state's move to shut down Signature Bank, similarly emphasized that taxpayers would not be responsible for the costs of the program.  “This is not a bailout,” Harris said.  Harris also pushed back against the idea that Signature was doomed because of its exposure to the crypto industry.  “Signature Bank had a broad depositor base, so this idea that it is a crypto-based bank is not an accurate one,” Harris said. “This is not about a particular sector in the cases of Signature Bank, but we moved quickly to make sure depositors were protected.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/13/president-biden-calls-for-stronger-bank-regulations-in-wake-of-svb-signature-bank-collapses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49827452e1fc28d976f67567180af2a3882f73ef-5892x3314.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387922,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQyLvD,1678719600,Crypto Payments Specialist Stellar Bridges Fiat and Stablecoins to Polkadot,"Cryptocurrency payments specialist Stellar is linking to Polkadot and its sister network Kusama via the newly built Spacewalk bridge, a move that will connect the two blockchain ecosystems with Stellar’s fiat on-ramps around the world.  The bridge, built by recent Polkadot parachain auction winner Pendulum, aims to connect decentralized finance (DeFi) applications with foreign exchange (forex) markets, especially in emerging markets where, since it was founded in 2014, Stellar has built up a footprint and partnered with the likes of cross-border payments company MoneyGram.  While crypto’s banking rails in the U.S. have largely been dismantled, seasoned firms like Stellar and others are continuing to build out critical infrastructure to do the job elsewhere.  The Spacewalk bridge is now live on Polkadot’s so-called canary network, Kusama, and the Polkadot version will be open within one or two week’s time, according to Pendulum co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Torsten Stüber.  Pendulum’s mission is to combine traditional finance with DeFi, said Stüber, who is also CTO at SatoshiPay, a crypto micropayments firm that has a long history of building on top of Stellar. The focus is firmly on stablecoins or fiat tokens, Stüber added, and not necessarily Lumens, the native cryptocurrency of the Stellar network.  “Stellar has a great implementation of stablecoins, as well as on-ramps and off-ramps in different countries for different kinds of fiat currencies,” Stüber said in an interview with CoinDesk. “I don’t think you’ll find any other network that has so many different fiat currencies tokenized on the platform.”  USDC will be the main stablecoin flowing across the Spacewalk bridge, and it’s also the token Stellar integrated with MoneyGram that the firms began rolling out last year.  There will also be an array of regional currency stablecoins available, said Tomer Weller, vice president, product at Stellar Development Foundation. This includes tokenized Argentinian pesos and Brazilian reals, as well as a Kenyan shilling, some other African stablecoins and a couple of euro-based ones, Weller said.  “Basically every MoneyGram agent in the world is an access point to the Stellar network,” said Weller in an interview. “So users can off-ramp their Stellar assets to actual cash in more than 300,000 locations around the world. They can also access and on-ramp their cash to crypto, and specifically stablecoins, in a smaller subset of that, and we’re slowly rolling that out to more and more countries.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | FIAT | MARKET | XLM,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/13/crypto-payments-specialist-stellar-bridges-fiat-and-stablecoins-to-polkadot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5bc77d865d47872aa2475a3e3c6d5794438db40b-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a Friday filing, the U.S Trustee said it had urged the bankrupt crypto lender to move $227 million in uninsured money market funds somewhere safer, in a week that that culminated in SVB being shuttered by California regulators.  “BlockFi is fine – we have access to cash to operate in the normal course including paying our employees and vendors,” Christine Okike of Kirkland and Ellis told the court on behalf of the company.  “We expect to have access to $37 million of the $278 million at SVB later today,” Okike said, adding that $236 million was invested in “highly rated money market funds” run by BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, with SVB acting as agent on behalf of BlockFi.  The New Jersey bankruptcy court had banned BlockFi from investing in secondary financial markets, according to a filing by U.S. Trustee Andrew Vara made on Friday. In a series of letters starting Feb. 17, Vara, a Department of Justice official responsible for bankruptcy matters, urged the lender to shift the funds somewhere where it would be protected by a government guarantee from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  Lawyers for BlockFi had sought to argue that the funds should stay where they were, as credit ratings were sound and the investment generated $10 million a year for the estate, Vara said.  Okike told the court on Monday that she will work with the U.S Trustee to ensure compliance with the bankruptcy code as soon as the company has access to the funds again.

The Circle-issued stablecoin fell in value late Friday as holders rushed to redeem their tokens upon learning that Circle kept some portion of the funds backing USDC in Silicon Valley Bank, which state and federal regulators took over on Friday morning.  Circle later acknowledged that about $3.3 billion – or about 8% of the overall funds backing USDC – were held in Silicon Valley Bank. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said Friday that insured SVB depositors (including CoinDesk) would regain access to their funds by Monday, but said uninsured depositors would only get an advance sometime this upcoming week. As the FDIC sells off SVB’s assets, these uninsured depositors would receive a dividend. More than 90% of the funds held in SVB were uninsured.

The announcement came after a number of major crypto exchanges suspended or paused USDC-related transactions. Coinbase (COIN), the largest exchange in the U.S., paused conversions from USDC to U.S. dollars late Friday.

42421333,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqlZ,1678714993,The Australian Open Goes Full Web3,"Match point. The 2023 Australian Open men’s finals. Novak Djokovic, who had missed last year’s tournament because of his vaccination status, was now on the verge of winning his record 10th Australian Open. If he wins this point, he wins the set, he wins the tournament, and he ties Rafael Nadal for the men’s record of 22 Grand Slam titles – giving him a legitimate claim to be the greatest men’s player in history. (No pressure.)  Jeff Wilser is a freelance author who has written seven books. This article is part of ""Culture Week.""  Djokovic blasted the serve; it clocked in at 127 miles per hour. His opponent, Stefanos Tsitsipas, somehow got it back in play. They hit it back and forth. Then Djokovic sensed his chance: He smoked a tough backhand to push Tsitsipas to the far edge of play, which left the rest of the court wide open. Djokovic pounced. He crushed a forehand to the empty side of the court – Tsitsipas had no chance – and placed the ball so perfectly that it kissed the sideline, just barely in bounds.  Djokovic had just won his 22nd Slam.  It was an exciting point. But for a certain segment of the Australian Open fans, the point meant something else entirely. Thanks to tennis’ Hawk-Eye system – a network of cameras and computers that can instantly show precisely where the ball lands on the court within a millisecond – tennis officials knew exactly where that final ball had bounced. Think of the tennis court like a grid. That grid is divided into thousands of tiny plots, and there are people very curious about which of those plots, exactly, received the final bounce.  For Djokovic’s match point, the ball landed on Plot #1174. This is linked to an “Artball” NFT of ball #7407. And the fan who owns that non-fungible token just won tickets to next year’s tournament. In fact, for every finals point in every match in the 2023 Australian Open, the final “bounce” of the winning point is pegged to an NFT, and that NFT just became more valuable.  Larger embrace of Web3  The NFT experiment is just one part of the Australian Open’s larger embrace of Web3, which, frankly, is somewhat astonishing, given the frost of crypto winter. What’s even more surprising? The Open says it’s working, and they want to do more.  “We heard feedback from a lot of these consumers that they were watching more tennis than they ever watched before,” Ridley Plummer, who heads up the Web3 strategy for the Australian Open, said. “Wherever they were in the world, they were either getting up early, or staying up late, to watch the end of the matches, because they wanted to see where the match point landed.”  See also: Wyoming Now Allows Crypto Wagers for Online Sports Betting  Then there’s the Australian Open in Decentraland. Working with a metaverse and NFT development studio, Run it Wild, the team created a replica of the Rod Laver Arena and its surroundings. I took my nerdy little avatar that I created back in early 2020 (which is still wearing the goofy Mariachi hat, more on that here) into Decentraland to check it out myself and was surprised by its verisimilitude.  This is the second year that the Australian Open has experimented with the metaverse. In 2022, according to Run it Wild, Decentraland’s Australian Open saw 175,000 unique sessions from 157 countries, making it the highest attended event in Decentraland. The platform also launched the Artball NFTs in 2022, selling 6,776 balls to 3,679 holders. (It then sold more Artballs this year.)  We might be in a bearish climate for crypto, but the Australian Open is one of the most interesting examples of Web3 actually being used by a mainstream brand. For years, in abstract terms, crypto enthusiasts have theorized how NFTs could help traditional brands engage with customers. The Australian Open is now doing that.  The Artball NFTs, for example, unlock a kind of membership that gives certain perks. Owners of the Artballs can watch the players warm up on practice courts, get access to presale tickets and geek out on tennis content that no one else can see. “We have nearly 300 cameras at Melbourne Park that we can create tailored content [from], that is very different from what a broadcaster shows you on television,” Plummer said.  Big brands in the metaverse  Crypto purists might view decentralized worlds like Decentraland and The Sandbox as the only true metaverses, but larger brands see things differently. Roblox is a virtual world with more than 200 million active users, which is why the Australian Open added a Roblox experience this year, and it even snagged Nick Kyrgios, the local Aussie tennis hero, as a Roblox ambassador.  “I’m stoked to be a part of AO Adventure in Roblox,” Kyrgios said in a statement. “I hope that gamers enjoy interacting with humanoid Nick and pick up a few tips and tricks along the way.”  The Australian Open sees the metaverse as more than just a one-time gimmick to goose sales or fetch publicity – it could be a way to extend fan engagement throughout the year. For the most part, says Plummer, the Australian Open is truly relevant for only one month out of the year, “and then everyone moves on to the next event.”  Plummer thinks the metaverse and other Web3 tools could help create an “evergreen model for twelve months of the year,” where fans can play Australian Open games indefinitely.  The numbers aren’t tiny. So far, the Australian Open kids game in Roblox has racked up 6.3 million visits, and Plummer views this as a way to grow the brand globally. Sure, at the moment, maybe these kids have little buying power. But what if they grow up playing these Australian Open games? What if it sticks in their craw? Plummer said that if they can “put the AO brand in their heads” and influence some to put the Australian Open on their bucket list of places to visit, and maybe even hop on a plane and buy a ticket one year, “then that for us is success.”  See also: Fan Tokens: A Bet on Your Favorite Soccer Team?  As for having the confidence to build in the metaverse during crypto winter, when other brands are skittish? Plummer always saw this as a long-term experiment. It needs time to breathe.“When we ideate something,” Plummer said, “there’s the sense that we should be doing this for a minimum of two, three or five years … Let’s not just do it once and then move on to the shiny new thing.”  And while your mileage might vary on how much you get out of watching tennis in the metaverse, those Artball NFTs – linked to actual game action – strike me as fun, inspired and destined to be copied in other sports. Why not link NFTs to where the baseballs smack the home run wall? Or to where the touchdown is scored in the end zone? Or, for that matter, for the tennis courts of the U.S. Open, French Open or Wimbledon?  The idea isn’t lost on Plummer. He pauses, chuckles, mentions that certain partnerships could someday be in the works, and then said, “Imitation’s the highest form of flattery, right?”",POSITIVE,없음,MANA | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/13/web3-australian-open-culture-week-consensus-magazine,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ad3e0c1fbd76f1d6c6cba1b399df5263ec38cf2-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411035,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giB4Kw,1678714479,Stepn Was a Runaway Success During COVID but Can It Keep Moving Forward?,"All you could do is walk. That was what Yawn Rong realized in Adelaide, Australia, during the summer of 2021. Thanks to the COVID-19 restrictions, you were not allowed to drive anywhere. You were not allowed in bars. Just about the only thing you could do was walk. So Rong’s neighbors were walking more than he had ever seen in his life – walking dogs, walking babies, walking just to clear their heads.  Maybe he could turn this into a game? By then Rong, 38, was an entrepreneur with a wacky resume. He once worked a McDonald’s night shift, he worked at an Australian mining company (digging for zinc and gold, not bitcoin), he launched a Vietnamese restaurant franchise and he co-founded a crypto investment and trading fund. So why not create a walking-based game?  This feature is part of CoinDesk's Culture Week.  Along with his neighbor and friend Jerry Huang, who ran a computer game company, Rong had the idea of creating a kind of Super Mario Brothers game that incorporates real-life walking. Instead of moving Mario from left to right on the screen, you would see the game from a first-person perspective and you would actually walk through the game’s levels. And this would all be done outside to make it COVID-friendly.  They wrote a white paper. They called friends and investors. As Rong now describes it, the feedback was clear: “It’s a stupid idea.”  So they streamlined it. Rong and Huang scuttled the game’s storyline and focused on the core concept: Just walk. Get rewarded. Move to earn.  The idea would evolve into Stepn, which the founders now describe as a “Web3 lifestyle app,” that uses crypto-fueled rewards to get people to exercise. Stepn hit Apple’s App Store in early 2022. To make this happen, Rong says he and the team worked “seven days a week, around 15 to 20 hours a day.” And over the next year, while it seemed like most of crypto languished and lurched from one embarrassment to another, Stepn quietly found a massive audience. At its peak, the company claims to have had over 4 million monthly active users. The company reported $122.5 million in second-quarter profits. Rong and Huang now lead a team of over 100 employees, and they’re still hiring.  “Humans were not evolved to run on the beach, they were evolved to sit by the beach and read a book,” says Shiti Rastogi Manghani, Stepn’s chief operating officer. “We were not evolved to eat salads. We were evolved to eat a burger and watch TV.” What we need to combat the reality of our lazy evolution, says Manghani, is “accountability systems.”  Werk work  This is what one of Stepn’s super-users and brand ambassadors, James Werk, realized after trying the app. Werk, 47, lives in northern Georgia by the Appalachian Trail. He loves to hike. And he had a goal of strapping on a 75-pound pack and hoofing it from one section of the trail to another but he knew he couldn’t pull it off. When going uphill and lugging the pack, Werk couldn’t last a mile.  “It takes a lot of time and effort to build the stamina,” says Werk, a former account rep for Pfizer, who then pivoted to playing video games full time and streaming them on Twitch, as one does. Werk knew that he needed to spend less time playing games and more time hitting the trails. But he found it tough to stay motivated. When he learned about Stepn, he viewed it as an “accountability partner,” like the friend who insists you meet at the gym at 8 a.m.  This accountability partner isn’t cheap. Here’s how Stepn works: You buy a non-fungible token (NFT) of a virtual sneaker, and then this NFT – by synching to your phone – will dole out rewards when you walk, jog or run. (Various levels of sneakers will grant different rewards.) When Werk bought his first sneaker-NFT, he paid $1,200. This is a lot of money for imaginary sneakers. As one skeptic tweeted, “Who the hell is gonna pay thousands of pounds or dollars for NFT sneakers…???” (The prices have since tumbled; as of publication, the cheapest sneaker NFT is now around $50.)  Werk made good use of the splurge. “Stepn became that reinforcement to not take two or three days off,” he says. “To actually go out and walk every morning and do my hikes.” Werk began to obsess over optimizing the rewards – taking multiple walks per day to max out his winnings. He tracked his fitness progress with a heart monitor. “I could see that as I exercised consistently every day, my sleep was improving,” he says. “My resting heart rate and my max heart rate was improving.”  Meanwhile, the gamer side of Werk’s personality was geeking out on the Stepn rewards system. It’s not as simple as “buy a digital sneaker, walk and earn rewards.” That’s the general idea, but the game has a complicated framework of level-ups, mini-rewards, random prizes and decisions you can make to optimize your loot. (The game also, to the chagrin of many, entices you to pour more money into Stepn, a feature that caused thousands of users to quit. More on that later.) “You can gamify every part of it,” says Werk with excitement, speaking quickly. He explains that you can win “mystery boxes” that might contain digital goodies like “gems” (used to upgrade the sneaker) or perhaps “minting scrolls.”  To many, this will sound like gobbledygook. But this is the kind of intricate system that millions of gamers crave. Half the fun of any RPG (role-playing game) is to level-up your character – deciding where to allocate resources and how to unlock the most power. For the nerds among us (raises hand), this taps into the warm nostalgia of Dungeons and Dragons. Do you max out your wizard’s Intelligence or also sprinkle in points for Strength and Wisdom? Or, will all of this minimize your chance of finding a girlfriend?  Werk clarifies that he’s not getting rich playing Stepn. But he likes that he’s “stacking up my Solana” (Stepn runs on the Solana blockchain) and that each week he’s “putting a little something aside.” And after several months of using Stepn every day, Werk says that he can now throw on a 75-pound pack and reach more sections of the Appalachian Trail. “It gives me the freedom to do a three-day hike, 10 miles a day,” says Werk, which now lets him “get to waterfalls or camping shelters I couldn’t get to before.”  Atomic (crypto) habits  There are stories like Werk’s all over Stepn Twitter. In something of a Web3 version of the Peloton cult, where the community (loudly) encourages each other to keep cycling. The “Stepineers” broadcast their results and cheer each other on. One woman shared the story of how, after she battled cancer, Stepn helped her go from using crutches to walking with confidence. Another user proudly tweeted, “Lost 20 pounds since February.” Another gushed that he had lost 40 pounds of fat and that “Stepn helped me quit smoking. Nicotine free, baby! Can you put a price on that?” Although someone cheekily responded that yes, actually, you can put a price on that – the price is what you spent on all those sneaker NFTs. “That is true,” the smoking-quitter replied, acknowledging that he’d invested $25,000 to that point, but was “completely happy with the returns.”  Or take a woman named Blair, who described her age as “in the 44 to 52 range.” She’s an e-commerce entrepreneur who’s originally from Central America and now lives in Florida. “All of my life I’ve been very sedentary. Reading and staying indoors and driving around,” says Blair. She knew about fitness tracking apps like MyFitnessPal, but those never did much for her. Stepn struck her as different.  The virtual sneakers cost $1,000 at the time, but Blair viewed the price tag, in a sense, as an investment in the overall Stepn company. “I thought the company was like a unicorn,” she says. “It sounded like a project that had the runway to become really successful.” This is, after all, why many people buy tokens or NFTs or other crypto assets – they speculate that the project will appreciate in value. Sometimes they do, often they do not.  Read more: Max Good - Fan Tokens: A Bet on Your Favorite Soccer Team?  Blair bought a second sneaker, then a third, then a fourth and then she eventually bought a total of 30. (At 30 sneakers, the rewards are maxed out.) She acknowledges the NFTs are now worth far less than what she paid, but she expects the market to eventually recover, and says, “You only lose if you sell.”  The real value of these virtual sneakers, to Blair, is not the money, it’s the motivation to sweat. “It really has changed my life,” she says. “I never thought I would be walking 5 kilometers every day.” (That’s about 3.5 miles.) If she skips a day she earns less income, so she walks every day no matter how hot or humid the Florida weather. She says this brings in around $8 per day (it used to be $20), and that thanks to Stepn she has lost 30 pounds.  Then there’s Shan Taylor, 35, who lives in the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, Australia. (Taylor, like Blair, is now an official Stepn ambassador.) He describes himself as once being “morbidly obese.” Taylor is now fit and trim. It’s not accurate to say that Stepn helped him drop the weight; five years ago he had bariatric (weight loss) surgery and lost 110 pounds, then he started running marathons and ultra-marathons. This was all pre-Stepn. But in early 2022, after a string of injuries, Taylor found himself once again demotivated, lacking the willpower to resume his training.  By now you can see where this is going. Taylor, who had already dabbled in crypto (he owned bitcoin and ether), spent roughly $1,000 on his first Stepn sneaker. He joined the Stepn Discord. He began running a bit each day, he bought more Stepn sneakers; he then ran even more, and then he ran faster.  Stepn’s secret sauce? Taylor points to the power of ingraining regular habits, and for this he cites the book “Atomic Habits” by James Clear, which (in a complete coincidence) I had just finished reading. Clear argues the best way to make a habit stick is to start with a tiny, bite-size chunk and then do just a little bit each day. “Read one page of a book every day” is more likely to stick than “Read 20 pages every day.” Stepn uses that playbook. The early goals and rewards are modest – just a few minutes per day – which then gets you rolling and thirsty for more.  “Do a little bit each day,” says Taylor, who was surprised to find that by consistently running every day he eventually beat his PB (personal best) in a half-marathon. “I don’t have to go to the gym and smash myself,” says Taylor. “Sometimes the best thing is just consistency and low intensity.”  Decay and pressure  If all of this seems too good to be true, well, there’s another virtual shoe to drop. Manghani says that at its peak, Stepn had nearly 1 million active daily users. Today it has 150,000. One reason is that the price of GMT (Stepn’s token) crashed from $4 in April 2022 to 33 cents as of this writing, which means the rewards are lower and the incentives weaker. Another reason could be the macro struggles of crypto winter. But the root cause might be the very nature of Stepn’s model.  Stepn is a move-to-earn game, and this is cut from the same cloth as play-to-earn games like Axie Infinity and ICE Poker. Play-to-earn models have one devastating liability: They might not be sustainable. The critique is that at a certain point, after the growth phase when new users pour cash into the game, eventually the music will stop and the value of the tokens will plummet, like a Ponzi scheme. You can’t indefinitely shower users with money – something has to give. “The more users you have, the more rewards are given out. The more rewards you give out, the more inflation you’re creating. It’s just simple economics,” explained the YouTuber (and one-time Stepn ambassador) who goes by the alias “Bitcoin Daily.”  Rong and team know this is a problem. So to make the game as viable as possible, they tinkered with the tokenomics to add “deflationary” pressures that would slash the supply of tokens, which in theory should stabilize the prices. For example, in August they introduced a “Rainbow” sneaker, and the only way to score the Rainbow is to burn (destroy) your other sneakers. Some users found this outrageous. Bitcoin Daily said it “completely over-complicates the game” and posted a two-hour video detailing why he is leaving Stepn.  Then there’s the concept of “decay.” In July 2022, Stepn announced a fun new wrinkle to the game: Each shoe would now have a certain amount of “Health Points,” and whenever you went out and walked or ran with the sneaker, those HPs would gradually be depleted, or “decay.” You could replenish your sneaker’s HPs by burning tokens or other assets.  As the Australian company cheerfully described in an open letter, “The way nature restores its balance on Earth is through its cycle of life and death – imagine all the species on this planet not dying! That system would never be sustainable.” But it wasn’t hard to read between the lines: Users would now, suddenly, need to pay a fee to maintain their $1,000 virtual shoes.  The Stepineers were not pleased. “So this increases the cost for users, without introducing any benefit,” one user grumbled on Twitter. “So we have to spend more resources. Yay. Way to motivate us,” tweeted another. Others pointed out the contradiction between the game’s spirit – rewarding you for moving – and the new economic model, which triggers a penalty for moving. As one user put it, “This game is designed for better health by keeping moving. And now, the health points will be reduced just because of moving???” Many agreed with the top user comment on Stepn’s open letter: “One of the … stupidest and tone deaf thing[s] ever. Go tax your loyal users whose diminished returns have dropped 90%. You f**king made $120 million. How much of a rug pull is this?”  Rong concedes it was unpopular. He acknowledges the update became a “permanent tax on users” and that it led to a “huge backlash.” He says Stepn lost a “chunk of users” and heard complaint after complaint. (It deserves credit, at the very least, for actually listening to the complaints. Stepn is the rare crypto company that has a customer service department; Rong says the team received 20,000 email inquiries per day and they wanted to reply to them all. At one point the company recruited 30 customer service reps per day to keep up with the demand.)  Fitness is the biggest onboarding mechanism from Web2 to Web3  Health Points were hated, but Rong insists this was a necessary evil for the long-term viability of the project. “There are no perpetual machines in this world,” says Rong. “We can’t allow NFTs to have unlimited life without any repercussions” because that would lead to “ultimate inflation.” His larger point: When you buy the kind of real-life sneakers that you actually put on your feet, these do not last forever. The soles wear down and you need to buy new shoes. So the decaying model, in a sense, matches the dynamics of the real world.  But optimizing the tokenomics will only get you so far. I’m surprised when both Rong and Manghani concede that, yes, the economics of Stepn might not be sustainable … at least not without some external help. “As long as there are external revenue sources, it should be sustainable,” says Manghani.  Stepn is not the only product for Rong and team. They created a parent company, Find Satoshi Labs, that is an umbrella for other ventures including a decentralized exchange (DOOAR) and NFT marketplace (MOOAR), which bring in additional revenue. They also have revenue-generating partnerships, such as a deal with the Spanish soccer club Atlético de Madrid. “To expand the use cases, we have to create additional apps,” says Rong. “To not rely on Stepn as one product but to create a range of products.”  Rong is tight-lipped about what exactly the laboratory is cooking, but he hints there will be a social component, and they are “thinking about focusing on blockchain AI.” Manghani envisions a future where Stepn is not just a fitness app but also used as a sort of decentralized log-in that could be easily used across the internet. (In other words, a type of self-sovereign identity – here’s my deep-dive into SSID.) “Fitness is the biggest onboarding mechanism from Web2 to Web3,” says Manghani. And the hope is that once users have used Stepn to enter Web3, they’ll stick around to use adjacent products.  So the irony, in the end, is that even though Rong turned “all you can do is walk” into a successful project with millions of users, ultimately, in terms of long-term viability, the company will perhaps only be as successful as the next products it releases. What have you done for me lately?  Rong is no longer working seven days a week and 15 to 20 hours a day – he has scaled back to six days a week and 10 hours a day. But he knows he needs to deliver. “We feel the pressure like we did on day one,” says Rong. He cites one of his favorite business maxims: “You live if you are extremely worried. You die if you are too comfortable.”",POSITIVE,없음,AXS | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/13/web3-exercise-app-stepn-crypto-rewards,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c530c9016b7e38cdd2c12e839e83e14f539a4243-5978x3363.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421339,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqqj,1678712714,Rethinking the Value of DAOs,"Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) are an equitable, efficient means of distributing stakeholder power and resources. Removing the need for a central governing authority, they align with Web3’s decentralized, egalitarian ethos.  Since the original DAO – simply called The DAO – crowdfunded $150 million worth of ether (ETH) in 2016, we’ve heard about their potential to change everything from politics to philanthropy. Yet, the early clamor has died down and engagement levels in existing DAOs remain low.  Rick Porter is the CEO and co-founder of DSCVR, a Web3 social platform. This article is part of CoinDesk’s “Culture Week.”  So why has this revolutionary governance model failed to live up to its promise?  The answer lies in how – and why – each DAO is founded. Most are created by individuals or groups with a goal they believe others will share. But they often find that members either don’t show up at all or don’t stick around when they do.  We need to reverse this cycle: To build communities first and then create DAOs to support and serve their interests as they scale.  The DAO origin story highlights weaknesses  Created to capitalize emerging Web3 projects, The DAO came to prominence before crypto hit mainstream radars. It offered a novel model of collaborative governance, under which token holders were able to vote on different ideas to back and allocate rewards.  Record levels of fundraising demonstrated both the power and wide appeal of collective stewardship – until a $60 million hack sent The DAO crashing to the ground, almost taking Ethereum with it. The solution was a hard fork that took the network back to a point before the exploit, split Ethereum into two and altered the course of blockchain history.  The DAO initially appeared to have much in its favor, with a clearly defined purpose and ample funding. Some attribute its failure to bad luck. But that is to ignore the parallels in a more recent example: ConstitutionDAO, the so-called “financial flash mob” behind an unsuccessful bid to buy a copy of the U.S. Constitution.  See also: What Is a DAO? / Learn  Within a week of its founding, ConstitutionDAO raised $47 million from almost 17,500 contributors but was outbid at auction. Returning the funds proved challenging and fractious. High gas fees and administrative hurdles meant most contributors received a fraction of what they staked. Attempts to sustain the DAO and turn attention toward some new objective were soon abandoned.  The admission by Constitution DAO organizers that ""we have not been able to focus on giving the technical aspects of DAO governance mechanics the careful consideration and community deliberation this topic requires"" is telling. Still, the idea of DAOs still appears to have traction.  Start with ‘Community’  Personally, I’m not convinced the type of ad hoc campaigning is the best use of the enormous capabilities of the DAO model. In fact, these high-profile experiments have demonstrated how not to go about deploying one. Let’s recap what they taught us.  A clearly defined goal is good to have, but does not guarantee success or longevity.  Nor does money. Not even lots of it.  Publicity will attract more members. But no amount of hype will make them stay.  The glue that keeps everyone together and on the same page is only as binding as members’ ties to one another. That is why crypto builders need to start building a community before we create a DAO.  When a DAO comes first, social interaction is automatically forced and inauthentic – in part because of the financial incentives created by tokens. In contrast, thriving communities must be made of individuals who connect through shared interests (more than the pecuniary kind). A typical scenario would be coalescing first on social media, perhaps evolving from a Discord or Telegram group where folks chat, share ideas, offer tips, ask one another for help. They are growing together, creating shared values and building trust. At some point, a shared goal will arise naturally. Perhaps to stage an event, start a committee, define roles. Maybe the aim is to monetize skills.  DAOs are the framework that can help make these goals reality. They offer financial and structural empowerment, bringing organizational tools that make everything work. Smart contracts enshrine roles and operationalize community sales and payments. DAO tokens supply liquidity and provide efficient voting mechanisms.  The trajectory is very different when a DAO’s sole purpose is a defined external goal. Once that is achieved, or abandoned, the DAO is redundant. However grand the ambition, members have no incentive to stay.  DAOs can lead us out of crypto winter  Fortunately, we are now entering an era of widespread DAO adoption by truly engaged social communities. Cynics may disagree and point to today’s cold crypto climate. But that is my point. We’ve been here before, more than once. We know how it works.  Remember when non-fungible tokens (NFT) were new and exciting? Sales soared and fortunes were made. The June 2021 slump saw some poised to write their obituary but even higher peaks lay ahead, not least a Bored Ape Yacht Club launch propelling OpenSea to a single-day trading record.  See also: How to Use a DAO to Build a Web3 Community / Opinion  Such gyrations in the markets exemplify a fundamental economic principle: Hype cycles are a symptom of shallow community connections. Something grabs our attention, we take a look, dip a toe in the water. But when there is nothing to sustain our interest we move on.  Deeper engagement nurtures sustained value – like the type of building happening today. Authentic communities rooted in social interaction, online or off, have always been natural generators of economic activity. Those who contribute most stand to gain more.  Common purpose  The central purpose of a DAO is effective governance, but such structures cannot succeed without high levels of ongoing participation.  When DAOs arise out of engaged communities built on trust and shared interests, we will start to see them foster real, sustained change in the world.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Rick Porter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/13/rethinking-the-value-of-daos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a22c7e18ebc245005dc6ed8627170b75a721133b-2880x1620.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

FIL reached a high of $6.20 on Monday, up 18%, according to CoinDesk data. That put the token up 15% for the month. Bitcoin (BTC), meanwhile, has risen just 1% this month, while ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, has chalked up a 3% gain. The wider crypto industry has also struggled over the last month, with the overall market cap dropping below the $1 trillion mark.

Latest Prices  Top Stories  Risky assets pared or reversed early gains during the European trading hours as shares in San Francisco-based First Republic Bank (FRC) nosedived in premarket trading in the U.S., reflecting investor angst over the banking sector's health. Bitcoin pulled back to $22,000, after it nearly tested its 50-day simple moving average at $22,900 during Asian daytime hours. The cryptocurrency is still up 8% in the last 24 hour as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said all depositors of Silicon Valley Bank will have full access to their money beginning Monday morning. after confirming a successful transfer of deposits to a new bridge bank. The new bridge bank, called Silicon Valley Bank N.A., will be operated by the FDIC. Silicon Valley Bank is used by many tech companies, an area that includes crypto startups.  The cryptocurrency crisis went into high gear over the weekend as Silicon Valley Bank's failure caused some of the industry's core plumbing to go haywire. Stablecoin prices wildly swung and gas fees soared as investors scrambled to move money around hours after regulators shut SVB amid a run on the bank, which had ties to crypto. Circle Internet Financial's USDC stablecoin massively depegged from its intended $1 price – a harrowing development for a product designed as a place for investors to safely park money. The USDC/USDT pair sank as low as 87 cents on Saturday. It has since bounced back to 99 cents. The financial-services company confirmed late Friday that about $3.3 billion of the reserves backing the world's second-largest stablecoin was tied up at SVB.

The coin lost its dollar peg over the weekend because of SVB exposure from Circle, the coin's issuer. It has since stabilized back above 99 cents. There are still several concerns with USDC even though the peg has been largely restored. Over the weekend, most of the attention in the financial markets was rightfully on Silicon Valley Bank ( SIVB ) and what would happen to that institution's customer assets after FDIC had taken over deposits : Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, was closed today by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver. Early Sunday evening, it was announced depositors of SVB would be made whole in a joint statement by the US Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and FDIC: Secretary Yellen approved actions enabling the FDIC to complete its resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, in a manner that fully protects all depositors. Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13. But before the joint statement from government and central bank officials, there had already been a rather large impact in a somewhat unsuspecting place. Circle, a major crypto industry business, disclosed it had cash deposit exposure to Silicon Valley Bank: Twitter/Circle Circle is the issuer of USDC ( USDC-USD ). USDC is supposed be a ""stablecoin"" that has full parity one to one with the US dollar. In a subsequent blog post , Circle disclosed that the exact shortfall due to SVB uncertainty was $3.3 billion: Specifically, USDC is currently collateralized 77% ($32.4B) with US Treasury Bills (with a three month or less maturation period), and 23% ($9.7B) with cash held at a variety of institutions, of which SVB is only one. US Treasury Bills are the most liquid assets in the world and are direct obligations of the U.S. government. These reserves are held in custody by BNY Mellon , and active liquidity and asset management is managed by BlackRock . Bold is Circle's emphasis. The peg panic ensued in part because the majority of the collateral backing the deposits with Circle is held in treasuries, not cash. Even though these treasuries are short-dated, a $3.3 billion dollar hole becomes a significant problem if enough USDC holders rush to withdraw. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding Circle's USDC collateral, the USDC peg went on a bit of a wild ride over the weekend: USDC 7 Day Chart (CoinMarketCap) After plummeting under 90 cents late Friday night and early Saturday morning, USDC peg arbitragers brought the coin back during most of Saturday before popping up to $0.995 following the joint press release news of SVB depositors getting access to funds on Monday. Minting Mechanism Mechanically the way USDC works is fairly simple. Crypto participants who want dollar liquidity on crypto rails deposit their dollars with Circle. Circle keeps those dollars in cash and in treasuries and then mints the crypto coin USDC on public blockchain ledgers for the depositor. One key detail here is that Circle has used Signature Bank ( SBNY ) for processing USDC redemptions and that option is now gone as a result of Signature Bank's closure over the weekend . Circle's CEO Jeremy Allaire said on Twitter late Sunday that reliance is now shifting to Bank of New York Mellon ( BK ): With the closure of Signature bank announced tonight, we will not be able to process minting and redemption through SigNet, we will be relying on settlements through BNY Mellon. He went on to say they're working on a new automated minting and redemption system that could be online as early as Monday - but to this point it's really a guess when redemptions will be back online. There Are Still Risks Beyond the fact that Circle can simply turn off redemptions when it's in the company's interest to do so, Circle also has the ability to freeze assets on-chain and it has previously done so in response to Tornado Cash sanctions last year. USDC Banned Wallets (Dune Analytics/phabc) Circle has already banned 159 wallet addresses on Ethereum and these addresses have a combined value of $8.6 million. Furthermore, Circle still has the overwhelming majority of its depositor collateral in short term treasuries: Collateral (Circle) Even though I view a run on Circle's USDC cash deposits as a fairly unlikely event now that we know that cash hole from SVB is no longer there, it is at least possible that cash reserves could be drawn down and USDC withdrawals halted again in the future. In that scenario, USDC holders would essentially have Circle's duration problem shifted to them and if that's something they're okay with, they should probably just buy the treasury's directly themselves instead. Summary Circle is an important company in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The USDC stablecoin that Circle issues is one of the most notable assets that lives on crypto rails. Even though derivatives always have an element of risk, I don't believe there is a high likelihood that Circle won't be able to honor all withdrawal requests. It just might take some time to redeem all of them if a large amount of requests are submitted following Circle's implementation of a new redemption mechanism. Given what we learned from the joint release from FDIC, the Federal Reserve and US Treasury, it's unlikely at this point that the USDC peg will fall again due to any bank contagion but it's important to remember there are still several risks in holding Circle's flagship stablecoin. USDC withdrawals can be turned off. Even on chain, USDC swaps can be frozen. In many ways, stablecoins are the 'killer app' of decentralized payment rails but the largest ones still require centralized issuers. This is not ideal because centralized issuers carry regulatory concerns in addition to redemption concerns. It wasn't all that long ago stablecoin issuers were receiving Wells Notices from the SEC. I don't have exposure to USDC, but if I did I'd do my best to minimize it.",NEGATIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED | USDC,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4586955-usdc-circle-wild-weekend-getting-out-now?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10626415.jpeg

The Crypto space needs a robust regulatory framework. Moral hazard is as relevant as ever and needs to be taken into serious consideration by the US Government and Federal Reserve. The Story of Recent Economic History Economics is not just the study of cosmological numbers. It is the study and storytelling of excess, fear, triumph, and growth. Successful economists are able to mix equal parts data and storytelling to provide a compelling view into the black box that consistently turns similar inputs into drastically different outputs. By this point, you should all be aware that the week of March 6th, 2023 was the most dramatic week in the banking sector since the Great Financial Crisis. This week will be but another unfortunate case study in business textbooks that are published in the coming years, and although the rippling impacts are not yet fully understood, we already know what the arc of this story is. It seems like yesterday the economy was brought to its knees by the COVID-19 pandemic. In economics jargon, COVID was an exogenous shock to both supply and demand, and a rather dramatic one at that. It demanded arguably the most striking fiscal and monetary interventions in the history of the United States. After the economy is brought to a sudden halt, the swirling uncertainty and fears of an uncontrollable economic catastrophe require swift and sensational action. That action was the pumping of the economic pipes full of liquidity, causing the most rapid increase in money supply we have ever seen: Data by YCharts Essentially overnight, the total money supply in the economy more than tripled. Flooding the economy with cash is not necessarily an issue, but can lead to some interesting developments. We saw somewhat predictable outcomes; a stock market boom, a spike in personal savings, a drastic increase in bank deposits, and a subsequent surge in lending. In a vacuum, none of these should lead to catastrophic outcomes. As we know, 2022 saw a cooling of the market, a slowdown in lending volume, the fastest interest rate hike cycle in modern history, and a decreasing personal savings rate. Data by YCharts Again, none of this spells disaster. There is an increased likelihood of recession, more risk in the short-term market returns, and the return of high-yield savings accounts, but not impending doom. Irresponsibility and billions of dollars, mixed with muddled incentives, can drive irrational behavior and this week we got a taste of just how swift disaster can strike. Banking The story of Silicon Valley Bank ( SIVB ) is one of risk mismanagement. By year-end 2019, SIVB had a touch over $60B in total deposits. By year-end 2021, deposit volume ballooned to nearly $189B. Deposits are a liability for banks. At any moment, a depositor can walk into a bank branch and demand that money back. These liabilities are balanced by the core asset of a bank: loans. Banks generate profit by lending money at a higher rate than the rate they pay for deposits. In essence, while you may earn upwards of 4% in your savings account today, the bank is probably earning 5%+ on that money. For years, this dynamic was a non-factor for the risk management departments of banks. With interest rates at rock bottom, depositors didn't have a good alternative to low-yield deposit accounts. Therefore, banks could take deposits and lend or invest in marketable securities and make a healthy spread on that money, all while keeping the deposit base safe and sound. It's a win-win in this case: depositors have confidence in the safety of their money, banks can generate profits, and the economy is stimulated by fresh money creation. In the current environment though, depositors expect to be earning interest. When you can 'deposit' (in reality you are lending) money with (to) the US government and earn almost 5% interest , there's very little incentive to keep your money in a low-interest bank deposit account (other than liquidity). As a result, all banks have drastically increased the interest rate offered on high-yield deposit products to maintain relevance. Banks and fintechs alike need to offer almost 4% on savings accounts, while other products like certificates of deposits command even higher rates to compensate for their relative illiquidity. Robinhood ( HOOD ), a popular investing app, offers 4.15% on its cash sweep product, which allows users to sweep uninvested cash into a bank deposit account and earn interest instead of letting the cash sit. HSBC Bank's ( HSBC ) fully-owned US subsidiary offers 4.25% on a 12-month CD and just a touch over 3.50% on its high-yield savings account. This business model demands proper risk management. As Warren Buffett is oft quoted, there are more banks than bankers in this country. Irresponsible lending is the Achilles heel of any banking institution. The minute depositors lose faith, any bank immediately becomes an uninvestable and doomed business. Lack of faith will set in motion a bank run, in which depositors will demand their money back, and the bank will have insufficient cash on hand to meet withdrawal requests, effectively going bankrupt. This is dangerous because banks lend money out, and they can't call loans back as easily as depositors can request withdrawals. SIVB fell victim to this. As described above, banks make money by lending out deposits. This is referred to as fractional reserve banking. The reserve requirement is the percentage of total deposits that a bank must hold in cash (""cash in reserve"") instead of lending. During the COVID uncertainty, the Federal Reserve dropped the reserve requirement to 0, and although this made sense at the moment, it was folly for the Fed not to increase the reserve requirement once the 2021 boom was in full effect. However, even if we had a higher reserve requirement, SIVB may still have met the same fate. SIVB had very little diversification in its lending base. Total loans more than doubled, from $32B in December 2019 to $73B in December 2022, and a significant portion of these loans was in the tech industry. Tech, particularly micro-cap tech, saw the deepest pits of the 2022 bear market. With an overwhelming majority of its lending base belonging to the industry suffering the most, SIVB became a ticking time bomb. That timer was set to March 10th, when SIVB went ""poof"" overnight. As deposits were drastically increasing, SIVB bought a low-yield, unhedged bond portfolio in 2021 to keep that money working. In and of itself, this isn't a major issue. The issues began when the Fed began rapidly increasing rates to tame inflation. SIVB management had the decision to make: either keep the money earning ~2% in this bond portfolio or sell at a loss and put the money in US T-bills earning ~5%. They decided to sell at a ~$2B loss and buffer this loss with a stock offering of comparable size. This offering would have covered the loss but would have also diluted current owners by nearly 20%. The stock tanked on Thursday, March 9th in response to this news. Even on the morning of March 10th, it was not entirely clear whether SIVB would fail or not. There was a chance to shore up liquidity with the stock offering. Then, the stock offering fell through, and the stock price tanked even further. A dramatic stock price decrease does not shutter a bank in and of itself, but this stock freefall caused something much more dangerous to happen: SIVB depositors lost faith in their deposits. Overnight, withdrawal requests started piling up, and the liquidity crisis ensued. Here we are today: the FDIC effectively owns SIVB, and depositors are unsure whether they will get their deposits above $250k back. This is causing ripple effects through the California wine industry, VC space, tech-startup industry, and the crypto space. I cannot shed light on what will happen next (if I could, I wouldn't be writing this article, I'd be scraping together every penny I could find to profit off my superior foresight!), but now I'd like to shift the discussion onto crypto. Bitcoin Earlier this week, Silvergate Capital Corporation ( SI ), closed its doors one last time. What started in the mid-2010s as an expansion of the business into the crypto space by offering bank accounts to companies involved in Bitcoin services, rapidly devolved into what would cause its demise. Following the historic fraud and crash of FTX, Silvergate started feeling pressure on its deposits. The crypto space was suffering before the FTX fiasco, and this obviously hurts the banks that offer services to companies in this space. Withdrawal requests exceeded $8B , and Silvergate felt the pressure of a bank run . The company had a fire-sale of some assets, which caused another significant loss to be realized. Once they delayed the release of their annual report, depositors lost faith. As with SIVB, the end of this bank was the moment the depositors lost faith in the liquidity of their deposits. Aside from Silvergate causing concerns in crypto, SIVB is now stirring up some additional pressure in this space. Circle , the company that offers USD Coin ( USDC-USD ), has $3.3B of its $40B of USDC reserves with SIVB. This caused USDC, which should trade 1:1 with the US Dollar, to drop as low as $0.84 on the dollar on March 11th. At the time of writing, USDC has stabilized a bit to $0.94, But when a product that is designed to trade 1:1 is trading at 0.94:1, its legitimacy is in serious question. If USDC becomes entirely illegitimate, the wider crypto space will face increased pressure, on top of what has already been a dramatic bear market. At age 99, we should be used to Charlie Munger being right about things, as he so commonly has been. The investing titan of Berkshire recently called ""crypto-crap"" a worthless market and said anyone who disagrees is an idiot. Shortly thereafter, one of the foremost crypto-related banking institutions collapsed and now the legitimacy of Stablecoins is in question. Bitcoin maximalists believe Bitcoin transcends crypto, though. They see a decentralized finance future that uses Bitcoin as the universal currency. Fanatical claims of "" Bitcoin to $1 million "" have become commonplace. Even institutional investors, namely Cathie Wood, have bought into the Bitcoin hype. These maximalists also believe that Bitcoin, with its fixed supply, fixes the risks of fractional reserve banking and the fiat money system (which effectively has an unlimited supply). Bitcoin is missing a few really important aspects that the US dollar has, though. First, the US dollar has the full faith and backing of the most powerful military and largest economy in the history of the world. Second, the US dollar has an extensive taxation and regulatory framework. Third, the US Dollar has the ability to become a Central Bank Digital Currency, which is something that could destroy the utility value of Bitcoin. The one thing Bitcoin has that the US Dollar will never have is full anonymity, decentralization (except for the pesky risk that some billionaire buys up most of the available Bitcoin and refuses to ever sell it), and utilization of a blockchain network. Let's face it, if the US refuses to construct taxation and regulatory frameworks for Bitcoin, it has no future as the universal currency. At the risk of enflaming the Bitcoin maximalists, I'll even mention that all major 'milestones' of Bitcoin are denominated in USD. The milestone of ""Bitcoin to $1 million"" still has one very important feature: it's compared to the US dollar. The value of a Bitcoin is currently only referenced relative to how many US Dollars it's worth. Further, it has very minimal transactional value. I can't go to my local gas station and pay in Bitcoin yet. The Lightning Network makes this somewhat more feasible, but it's still in the very early stages of adoption. Anyone based in reality should not believe that Bitcoin will become the universal currency in the near future, and certainly should not invest with that expectation. If you want to use Bitcoin as a hedging tool against a deflationary fiat crisis in the US dollar, fine. But becoming the universal currency soon? Please live in reality. The 2nd largest economy in the world has already imposed an outright ban on crypto. And the largest economy will not so freely give up its status as the reserve currency of the world to a few lines of computer code. I could be wrong. There could be a decentralized finance revolution, which could make Bitcoin the universal currency of the future world. The extent of my exposure to Bitcoin will be an investment in Block, Inc. ( SQ ), though. (Mis)Behavior Finally, to tie together the two preceding discussions, let's move on to a discussion of behavioral economics and game theory. The title of this section is in reference to a book I recently began reading, Benoit Mandelbrot's The (Mis)Behavior of Markets . In his seminal application of fractal geometry on financial markets, Mandelbrot's thesis is that risk management is drastically misunderstood in modern financial theory. The foundation of modern finance theory is the assumption that variance and standard deviation are the primary components of market risk. Further, one of the main pillars is that market events follow a standard normal distribution or a 'bell curve'. In this light, modern financial theory acknowledges 'tail risk' but drastically underestimates its likelihood. For example, Mandelbrot mentions October 19th, 1987, popularized as ' Black Monday ' which saw a crash of unprecedented levels. A crash of this level should, according to a standard normal distribution, have such an infinitesimally small likelihood as to be functionally equivalent to 0%. This misbehavior, as Mandelbrot calls it, is caused ultimately by a misunderstanding and mismanagement of risk. This threat is amplified in the modern era of high-frequency trading and algorithmic trading, in which computers are making decisions in real time based on assumptions written into their programming. With a fundamental misunderstanding of risk, a historic rise in money supply coupled with rock-bottom interest rates, we finally arrive at the common thread of this story: moral hazard and misguided expectations. Something the US government has allowed to become pervasive throughout the financial industry. Moral hazard began as a fringe concept in game theory. Game theory is the study of how individuals and entities interact with each other, primarily in a market setting. Moral hazard states that there is a lack of incentive to guard against risk when one is protected from its consequences. This is best characterized by irresponsible bank lending and became a point of serious contention in 2008 when the Treasury bailed out banks with TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program). By 2008, big banks had been giving irresponsible mortgage loans for years, bundling those loans into mortgage-backed securities, using those securities as collateral in collateralized debt obligations, and then taking credit default swap insurance policies out on those debt obligations. In what became the nightmare we are all familiar with today, we learned that you cannot seek to drive riskless profit on the foundation of a junk asset. However, when ""everyone else is doing it"" in a capitalist system that requires businesses to keep up or die, human irrationality quickly takes over. This irrationality mixed with billions of dollars brought the entire global financial system to its knees. Ultimately, the US taxpayer bailed out these irresponsible bankers who quite reprehensibly received very little punishment relative to the harm they caused. Thus, moral hazard becomes a very serious risk to the modern economy. If banks believe they are 'systemically important' and believe they'll be bailed out in a crisis, even if they caused that crisis, then why concern themselves with pesky and complicated risk management? Although the concept of moral hazard doesn't fit perfectly with the retail investor purchasing crypto, it certainly fits the trend of famous investors touting the benefits of crypto and related services. When you are renowned and well-respected, people trust what you say. When people trust what you say, they are willing to put hard-earned money to work in an asset you advertise. When you advertise a speculative asset because you are being paid for it, you are irresponsible at best. Certainly, this should not distract us from the true criminal Sam Bankman-Fried, but Mr. Wonderful's actions were irresponsible, greedy, and reprehensible. And yet, he's shielded from the consequences. To be fair to Kevin O'Leary, it is not his fault and should not be construed as such. However, it is a good characterization of moral hazard because I doubt he would have advertised for FTX if he was to be held liable for all potential losses of the people that invested as a result of his sponsorship. After 40 years of globalization-driven low inflation and rapid corporate earnings growth, the economy has become drunk on liquidity, low rates, and misguided expectations. The banking industry could be facing its second major crisis in a 20-year span, and many retail investors have dumped significant amounts of money into digital assets with no transactional or utility value. All of this is based on a few core beliefs: the US taxpayer will bail out irresponsible banks, the Fed will return to easy money policies, and the bulls will rampage through markets again, and soon. Moral hazard has led to irresponsible asset allocation across both corporate and personal balance sheets which could cause a financial reckoning of unprecedented levels. In 2023, the US government needs to restore rapidly deteriorating faith in the banking sector and construct a robust regulatory framework for crypto, all while bringing inflation back into balance. 2023 is a year that will be characterized by imbalanced markets and uncertainty. I cannot tell you what the optimal asset allocation currently is, but I can implore you to diversify across asset classes, cash included, and be responsible with debt.

42414182,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB1kyM,1678701315,Euler DeFi Protocol Exploited for Nearly $200M,"Decentralized-finance (DeFi) lending protocol Euler Finance has suffered an exploit that resulted in almost $200 million being lost.  The losses occurred over four transactions in dai (DAI), wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), staked ether (sETH) and USDC, according to smart contract auditor BlockSec. The attacker used a flash loan to conduct the attack.  ""We are aware and our team is currently working with security professionals and law enforcement,"" Euler Finance said in a tweet. ""We will release further information as soon as we have it.""  Flash loans allow DeFi users to borrow millions of dollars against zero collateral. This isn’t crypto magic or free money: The loan must be repaid before the transaction ends or the smart contract reverses the transaction – as if the loan never existed. They are a popular way for attackers to gain funds to conduct exploits on decentralized systems. In April 2022, the Beanstalk stablecoin protocol was drained of $182 million, and in May 2022, more than $1.2 million was taken from Inverse Finance.  Euler's attackers used the loan to temporarily trick the protocol into falsely assuming it held a low amount of eToken, a collateral token issued by Euler based on whichever token is deposited on the protocol. A separate dToken, or debt token, is also issued by Euler so that an on-chain liquidation is automatically triggered when the amount of dTokens exceeds the amount of eTokens held on the platform.  The attacker took out over $30 million worth of dai stablecoin using flash loans from DeFi protocols Balancer and Aave, on-chain data shows. Some $20 million of that was sent to Euler, on which the attacker received $19.5 million worth of eDAI.  The attacker then borrowed 10 times the deposited amount from Euler, receiving 195.6 million eDAI and 200 million dDAI. The attacker repaid part of the initial debt using the remaining funds, tricking the protocol into falsely assuming it owed more to depositors than it held.  DeFi exploits – in which hackers make use of the open-source nature of a platform's code to gain unauthorized access to its assets – are one of the foremost problems plaguing the industry.  According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, over $3 billion was stolen from DeFi protocols via hacks or exploits in 2022.

Giving the central bank digital currency, or CBDC, the same status as banknotes and coins would mean payments legally discharge obligations to pay, and with mandatory acceptance at full face value, the paper said.  Legal tender status “would imply a legal obligation for (certain) payees to accept payments in digital euro … thereby increasing its network effects, and potentially affecting its distribution,” the document read.  The paper also asks ministers ""whether exemptions should be considered to ensure proportional application ... balancing the principles of contractual freedom and mandatory acceptance.""  At a previous discussion in January, ministers said the digital euro shouldn’t be programmable, because giving the ability to limit how a given payment can be used by the recipient would impair money’s fungible status.  The European Central Bank is set to formally decide whether to issue its currency in digital format in the fall, and officials are working on technical details such as which potential uses to prioritize.  Governments in European Union countries will be involved in agreeing on any legislation needed to underpin the CBDC. Last week, the European Commission's Mairead McGuinness confirmed that a bill due shortly will, alongside legal tender status, examine anti-money-laundering rules and compensation for those distributing the currency.

42414189,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB1leo,1678697587,Silicon Valley Bank Crisis a 'Cyprus Moment' for Bitcoin: Crypto Observers,"The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) is a blessing for bitcoin (BTC), crypto observers said, drawing parallels with the 2013 Crypus crisis that underscored flaws in the fractional reserve system and brought attention to decentralized, censorship-resistant BTC as a hedge against centralized banking.  ""Silicon Valley Bank, the 18th largest bank in the nation, collapsed yesterday – with it, we learn how last year’s record sell-off in U.S. Treasurys has created billions of dollars worth of unrealized losses within the banking sector and gain yet another example that in a system of fractional reserve banking, there are no depositors, only lenders,"" researcher Nik Bhatia and market analyst Joe Consorti said in the latest edition of The Bitcoin Layer newsletter.  ""The [Federal Reserve's] aggressive rate hikes and balance sheet reduction have caused a historic bank failure – fashioning a real-time ad for bitcoin self-custody,"" Bhatia and Consorti added.  The crisis at SVB began early last week after the startup-focused bank sold a portfolio consisting primarily of U.S. Treasury or government bonds at a loss and announced a share sale to shore up its balance sheet. Prices of Treasury notes have tanked over the past year thanks to the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hike campaign to control inflation. (Bond prices and yields move in the opposite direction.)  What followed was an old-fashioned bank run as SVB depositors scrambled to withdraw funds, with the total deposit call reaching $42 billion on Wednesday – nearly 25% of the total deposit base of $173 billion.  Bank runs happen because fractional reserve banking requires lenders to maintain only a small portion of deposits available for withdrawal while the rest are lent out to fuel economic activity. The system assumes that at any given point withdrawal demand will not exceed the pain threshold. The assumption, however, goes up in smoke when customer confidence tanks, as it did in SVB's case, leading to a spike in withdrawals and liquidity shortage at the bank.  Regulators usually step in after bank runs, seizing or taking control of deposits. The solution to the 2013 Cyprus banking crisis actually involved regulators raiding customer accounts. Germany coughed up around $13 billion in exchange for Cyprus levying a one-time tax on bank deposits to raise an additional $7.5 billion to complete the banking sector bailout.  In SVB's case, U.S. regulators took control of the deposits and shut down the bank on Friday. Over the weekend, the Biden administration announced all SVB depositors (which includes CoinDesk) could access their funds starting Monday. The announcement came as another New York-based lender, Signature Bank (SBNY), also failed, a sign of fast-spreading panic in the banking sector.  Though measures taken to address the SVB crisis aren't as draconian as the one taken for Cyprus, the entire episode underscores the point that customers' funds aren't as safe in regulated banks as we are made to believe. This point validated bitcoin's appeal as a decentralized peer-to-peer network and seizure-resistant cryptocurrency facilitating self-custody of funds.  ""'Not your keys, not your coins' is a lesson that, apparently, has to be learned again and again as history finds ways to repeat,"" Mike Fay, author of ""Blockchain Reaction,"" said in the latest article at Seeking Alpha, discussing investor takeaway from the collapse of SVB and Silvergate and the 2013 Cyprus banking crisis.  ""It's very easy to sit comfortably in the western world with the perception of safe and regulated banking institutions and not understand why anyone would feel compelled to purchase assets that live outside that world. But history shows that banks are capable of making bad bets or bad decisions,"" Fay added.  Bitcoin surged during Cyprus crisis  Bitcoin rallied sharply as the Cyprus banking crisis unfolded in March 2013. The cryptocurrency surged 178% to $93 that month and hit a record high of $265 in May 2013. Back then there were reports of euro and Russian ruble holders diversifying into bitcoin after seeing bank shutdowns in Cyprus.  ""Ten years ago this week, there was a bank run in Cyprus, where ATMs were emptied and vaults were depleted. This event triggered the largest-ever rally (in percentage terms) in BTC, which rallied from $45 to $260 in a month,"" crypto trading giant Cumberland tweeted early Monday.  Coincidentally, bitcoin has risen over 15% since Friday, rising from two-month lows near $19,500 to $22,500, CoinDesk data shows.  ""When traders are unsure about crypto prices, they flee to stablecoins and bank deposits. When they are unsure about stables and bank deposits? It's crypto's time to shine, and BTC and ETH rallied 14 and 15%, respectively, over the weekend amidst uncertainty in the banking sector,"" Cumberland noted.

According to data from Nansen, the total balance of USDC in smart money wallets is approximately $485 million across 1,396 wallets. This is down from $700 million in 1,455 wallets a month ago and $1.02 billion in 1,478 wallets a year ago.  Meanwhile, the percentage of smart money in all stablecoins has dropped to 21%.

India holds the G-20 presidency this year.  ""A widespread proliferation of crypto assets comes with substantial risks to the effectiveness of monetary policy, exchange rate management, and capital flow management measures, as well as to fiscal sustainability. Moreover, changes may be required to central bank reserve holdings, and the global financial safety net, yielding potential instability. Finally, banks may lose deposits and have to curtail lending,"" the report said.  The report was produced after ""very helpful discussions with the Indian Ministry of Finance, as well as international focus group participants"" and led to the G-20 deciding on framing global crypto rules through a yet-to-be-framed synthesis paper jointly produced by the IMF and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).  The report also stated that ""there are many risks associated with crypto assets, although the significance and relevance of specific risks differ by country circumstances.”  An overwhelming theme of the report is the need for filling data gaps to facilitate policymaking.

Uniswap processed nearly $12 billion in trading volume over a 24-hour period from Saturday to Sunday.  DEXs rely on smart contracts instead of middlemen to provide financial services such as trading, lending or borrowing to users. Users deposit their tokens to pools to provide liquidity to the platform for rewards, typically a cut of fees paid by traders who use these services.  Dune Analytics data shows USDC pools for wrapped ether (wETH), tether (USDT) and dai (DAI) processed $15 billion in volume over a seven-day period, with a majority of this taking place from Friday to Sunday.  This generated over $8 million in fees for the Uniswap protocol, adding to Uniswap Labs’ revenue and a smaller percentage paid out to liquidity providers.  Elsewhere, stablecoin swapping tool Curve recorded nearly $8 billion in trading volume. One of its popular pools was out of balance as traders rushed to exchange USDC for other tokens.  Circle Internet Financial's USDC stablecoin massively depegged from its intended $1 price on Friday night after Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), where Circle parked over $3.3 billion in treasury assets, was shut by regulators.  That sparked a selling frenzy over the weekend, with bitcoin dipping from a major support level at $20,000 to as low as $19,200.  However, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) surged 10% in the past 24 hours to retrace all weekend losses on Monday.

Bitcoin inched just over $22,500 in Asian morning hours on Monday while ether regained the $1,600 level, as per CoinGecko. The move came as USD coin (USDC) issuer Circle said Sunday it would cover all shortfall in reserves, while U.S. regulators said SVB depositors will have access to all funds on Monday morning after the U.S. open.  Traders betting on a market-wide decline were caught off guard as a broader market recovery in the past 24 hours saw $183 million in shorts, or bets against price rises, getting liquidated.  Short traders made nearly 85% of all liquidations in the past 24 hours, Coinglass data shows.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  Liquidations on ether futures crossed $78 million, the most among all crypto futures, followed by bitcoin futures at $68 million. Such activity may have contributed to an overall market surge as shorts capitulated their positions.  Futures of other major tokens saw relatively lesser losses, suggesting movement was spot driven. Optimism (OP) and solana (SOL) took on $4 million in losses each, followed by litecoin (LTC) and aptos (APT) futures at $3 million.

42414185,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB1l8y,1678687200,"After Landmark Crypto Law, European Politicians Contemplate Building Their Own Blockchain","After regulating cryptocurrencies, European politicians are contemplating the next step in the race to attract Web 3 business – and it might be a tailor-made blockchain that respects privacy, Belgium’s digital minister told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview.  A new “Europeum” blockchain could be the vehicle to record property ownership, driving licenses or professional qualifications while sticking to the European Union’s high regulatory norms, Mathieu Michel said.  After a string of scams and scandals, Michel is in favor of moving away from purely financial applications of distributed technology, into public services and supply-chain management.  The EU has already drawn a line in the sand with its Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA), which sets governance and stability rules for cryptocurrency service providers.  If voted on in April, the bloc could become the world’s first major jurisdiction with a clear crypto framework – but the story shouldn’t end there if Europe wants to lead the world in blockchain, said Michel, a member of the French-speaking centrist party MR.  MiCA “goes in the right direction, but it’s only a first step,” Michel said, saying the bloc should consider “a blockchain network constructed around the foundational values” that underpin European society.  “Imagine you have Europeum – the blockchain that contains a whole series of conditions for protecting private life and so on, which are very transparent,” he said, conjuring a word that appears a play on the name of the Ethereum network. Instead of the political minefield of cryptocurrency, he said, it could focus on areas that are less sensitive or prone to abuse – like digitizing administrative documents or educational diplomas to be recognized across the bloc.  Read more: MiCA at the Door: How European Crypto Firms Are Getting Ready for Sweeping Legislation  For Michel, high European standards in areas such as data privacy – safeguarded by the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation – are an asset that the bloc can use to carve its own digital niche. Now, he believes, they may need to be reflected in Web 3.  Privacy  “Ethereum is traceable – I find that crazy,” he said of the trait that allows users to see full transaction details for a given wallet, a level of transparency he sees as excessive. “If you go to eat with your mistress at a restaurant, do you want it to appear on the blockchain?”  Michel, convinced that Web 3 can help companies organize their supply chains and governments offer public services, is on a mission to make his country a hub for Web 3 activity. On Feb. 20 he launched Blockchain for Belgium, to offer advice to policymakers, and provide networking opportunities for entrepreneurs in the sector.  Michel is frank about the challenges. Europe isn’t as easy a place to raise capital as the U.S., making it less attractive for any kind of startup. The situation is still harder given Belgium’s complex federal structure: key policies don’t lie in Michel’s hands, but in those of regional governments, or the finance minister, Christian Democrat Vincent van Peteghem – people who, Michel says, don’t always share his appreciation or optimism about the technology.  Michel nonetheless cites a range of blockchain projects – Datavillage, Solid and Settlemint – that chose to make the country their home, and cites a highly skilled workforce as chief among its strengths.  Skeptics  If Michel hopes a community of blockchain enthusiasts can help overcome lawmaker skepticism, it’s clearly not going to be easy.  In a March 8 parliamentary debate, held after the interview, lawmaker Michael Freilich said he was “disappointed” with the Blockchain for Belgium initiative, because, rather than acting immediately, the government is seeking recommendations that might only arrive towards the end of its mandate.  “I was expecting more … the results will once again be nothing,” said Freilich, who is from the right-wing New Flemish Alliance, which is the largest grouping in the Federal Chamber but isn’t one of the seven parties that form the governing coalition.  High among the complaints of the crypto community is the Belgian tax system – which imposes the highest labor levies in the developed world, and leaves the taxation of investment income in an unhelpful legal gray area. Michel suggests he’s been listening; he says he’s working on changes to clarify when and how virtual earnings should be taxed, something he says could help make Belgium “the Switzerland of blockchain.”  For blockchain entrepreneurs like Julien Romanetto of the Smurfs Society, a company which produces non-fungible tokens (NFT) of characters from the Belgian cartoon, the support from Michel is welcome – not least because policymakers have such a crucial role to play in determining the ecosystem’s future.  “Europe has a strong hand to play in blockchain,” Romanetto told CoinDesk. “There needs to be regulation, but it shouldn’t constrain … too much regulation and people will go to Dubai.”  “It’s great the government is doing something, but just setting up a WhatsApp group won’t be enough,” Romanetto said.

But Circle’s USDC stablecoin isn’t out of the woods.  That’s because Signature Bank, another critical financial institution to the crypto industry broadly and to USDC specifically, has just gone up in smoke. On Sunday, New York state officials shuttered Signature “in order to protect depositors,” making it the third crypto-friendly bank to go dark in four days. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire acknowledged on Twitter that this meant the company could no longer mint or redeem USDC through Signature’s Signet product.  Signature’s sudden failure leaves a key part of the crypto industry’s back-end infrastructure in limbo: Signet. It’s a blockchain-based real time payments system that’s supposed to work 24/7. Circle, Coinbase and many crypto trading firms used Signet. But with the death of Signature, Signet, too, has gone kaput.  When contacted Sunday, officials staffing Signet said they were in the dark on what would happen to Signet but expected to learn more information soon.  Allaire said in another tweet that the company would be “bringing on a new transaction banking partner with automated minting and redemption potentially as soon as tomorrow.”  The fate of Signet may prove important for Coinbase, too. In its third-quarter shareholder letter, Coinbase – another key company for USDC – said it had joined Signet to allow for real-time payments and settlements. “Users can now add USDC to the Web3 ecosystem in under 10 minutes,” the company said in the letter. Coinbase spokespeople did not immediately return a request for comment.  Late Friday Coinbase paused redemptions between U.S. dollars and USDC and said they would reopen Monday, when normal banking hours resumed.  USDC lost its peg to the U.S. dollar on Friday, hours after SVB entered FDIC receivership, amid uncertainty about how much of its funds were actually held in the bank. Circle eventually said it held $3.3 billion, or about 8% of the funds backing USDC, were held at SVB.  Circle holds no USDC reserves with Signature Bank, a Circle spokesperson said in an email to CoinDesk.  As of press time, USDC had gotten closer to regaining its peg to the dollar, trading at around 99 cents.

42414201,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB1mQZ,1678672378,First Mover Asia: Silicon Valley Bank Failure Highlights Small Banks’ Vulnerability; Bitcoin Soars Past $22.5K,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin surged above $22.5K after federal regulators said they'd cover failed SVB's customer deposits; ether and other altcoins also revive.  Insights: Lurking behind Silicon Valley Bank failure is the real sick man of American finance: small banks.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,052 +82.0 ▲ 8.4% Bitcoin (BTC) $22,482 +1921.8 ▲ 9.3% Ethereum (ETH) $1,614 +140.9 ▲ 9.6% S&P 500  3,861.59 −56.7 ▼ 1.4% Gold  $1,880 +18.1 ▲ 1.0% Nikkei 225  28,143.97 −479.2 ▼ 1.7% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Investors Buoyed by Regulators' Statement Send Cryptos Higher  After a nerve-wracking Thursday and Friday, crypto investors took heart over the weekend from a decision by U.S. regulators to restore all depositors at failed Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB) in full, and an announcement by fintech Circle to cover any of its stablecoin USDC reserves.  Bitcoin was recently trading at $22,482, up more than 9.3% over the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market value had plunged below $20,000 early Friday (UTC) as SVB customers withdrew their money en masse before the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation shuttered the institution, a central player in the world's technology sector. SVB's failure is the second-largest in U.S. history.  In a joint statement on Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell and FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg, said that after weighing FDIC and Federal Reserve recommendations and consulting with U.S. President Joe Biden, Yellen had ""approved actions enabling the FDIC to complete actions in a manner that fully protects all depositors"" at SVB.  “Today we are taking decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in our banking system,” the statement read.  Mark Connors, head of research at crypto asset manager 3iQ, called the agencies' action ""risk asset friendly at first blush"" in a weekly report, although he noted warily, ""Too many moving parts and M2 [monetary aggregate of currency and coins, savings deposits and shares in mutual money market funds] STILL contracting.""  But Connors also added: ""The Fed continues to extend their control on markets. What they announced this evening is the equivalent of guaranteeing overnight bank deposits in 2008.""  Ether also regained ground to change hands at $1,614, up 9.6% from Saturday, same time. Other major cryptocurrencies that were hard-stricken last week as the impact on the crypto industry from SVB's collapse became apparent also rebounded over the weekend, with their main surge coming on Sunday. APT, the token of layer 1 protocol Aptos, and ADA, the native crypto of Ethereum rival Cardano, were up more than 13% and 11%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of overall market performance, was down almost 10%.  On Saturday, payments technology company Circle Internet Financial said it would “cover any shortfall” in the assets backing its stablecoin USDC in the event it does not receive the entirety of a $3.3 billion cash reserve it was holding at Silicon Valley Bank. In a blog post, Circle said it “will stand behind USDC and cover any shortfall using corporate resources, involving external capital if necessary.” The value of the stablecoin fell as low as 88 cents before the announcement, but was currently trading above 99 cents.  U.S. stocks were swept up in banking sector worries, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 declining 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. The S&P finished down 5% for the week, its worst weekly performance since September 2022. As trading opened in Asia, the Nikkei 225 and Taiwan TSEC 50 Index were down slightly.  3iQ's Connors wrote that long-term the regulatory action to safeguard customers' assets would continue a ""game of regulatory whack-a-mole""leading to, among other affects, a continued consolidation of the banking industry and the acceleration of stablecoin regulation.  ""Outcome TBD,"" Connors wrote.

Insights  SIVB Collapse Shows Why Small Banks Are Vulnerable  Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB) has been shuttered by state regulators. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is racing to ensure that as much money as possible is available to SVB clients when the market opens Monday.  Late last week, Silvergate Bank, a major fiat on- and off-ramp for the crypto market, announced it was engaging in voluntary liquidation and shutting down, creating market panic. Its chief competitor, Signature, was seized by New York regulators over the weekend.  While SVB serviced some crypto companies, it didn’t service exchanges like Silvergate or Signature.  The Federal Reserve defines SVB as a large bank (these institutions have over $50 billion in deposits), and Silvergate as a small bank. Some have said should the FDIC not act decisively on Monday, contagion will spread throughout the broader banking sector. Already runs are beginning on First Republic Bank and other regional players.  Fundamentally, this crisis isn’t about crypto. The performance of tech companies – considered a risky asset – in a high-interest rate environment played a part, but it wasn’t everything either.  It’s about how small banks fared during stimulus-heavy COVID-19. These small banks aren’t as well known as SVB but, like Silvergate, specialize in serving an industry or niche.  They are also the ones that power fintechs. Cross River Bank (assets $9.9 billion) is the financial plumbing behind Coinbase, Stripe and Affirm. Evolve Bank & Trust (assets $1.3 billion) is the bank behind Wise and Dave.  These small banks like the arrangement because it diversifies their client base away from the usual local businesses that bank with small, regional institutions.  Tech startups, which move fast and break things, prefer to use small banks rather than traditional big banks. There’s a belief that they understand each other, and would get a more personalized, attentive experience rather than having an account with one of America’s largest banks. But in turn, this means that these small banks – which power fintechs – are overly exposed to the tech sector.  Covid, the curve and small banks  In 2020, small banks saw a massive influx of cash assets onto their balance sheets partly because of fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s asset purchases, which usually are geared toward an industry niche. As COVID-19’s impact on the economy wore off, cash supply turned into loans. Since September 2021 the growth in cash assets on small bank balance sheets has turned negative.  Throughout 2022, small bank lending increased while growth in cash assets stayed negative.  “Banks are now sitting with reserves pretty much at their lowest comfort level – especially small banks,” TS Lombard economist Steven Blitz wrote in a February note. “[Small banks] are more aggressive in lending and in borrowing short-term liabilities to fund themselves.”  Given the size of these institutions, and the lack of cash on hand compared to larger banks, Blitz writes that their borrowing was more aggressive. In addition, their small size meant they didn’t have the same level of regulation as their larger counterparts.  Fitz explains that post-COVID borrowings included advances from Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB), designed to provide stop-gap liquidity, or from the Fed’s discount window, usually reserved for emergencies.  “Small banks, many of which are private and therefore have no shareholder concerns regarding the optics of borrowing from the discount window, have consequently shifted to using the Fed’s discount window facility,” Blitz wrote.  Both Silvergate and SVB had large advances from FHLBs on the balance sheet.  In the case of Silvergate, it ended 2022 with $4.3 billion of FHLB money on the balance sheet. This figure increased dramatically from the $700 million it had at the end of September 2022 because it needed to support its cash position in the face of rapid withdrawals post-FTX crypto exchange collapse. Days before its collapse, it said the loans were fully repaid – further depleting its balance sheet.  Withstanding spikes in the cost of borrowing  Lending long and borrowing short has been the model for banks since the beginning of time, but an inverted yield curve contradicts this.  An inverted yield curve occurs when short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates – an anomaly because lending money for the long term should fetch a higher interest rate for the lender.  At press time, the two-year Treasury note yielded a whole percentage point more than the 10-year note. The two-year yield has increased by 300 basis points to 4.82% in 12 months.  The dramatic increase in the cost of borrowing for these banks makes their lives difficult, coupled with a very tech-specific deposit flight as investors prefer high-yield short-term bonds over risky tech and crypto.  Startups aren’t raising new money given this environment and burning what they have to stay afloat.  Silicon Valley Bank identified this as a problem in its first-quarter 2023 mid-quarter update.  FRED data shows the same is happening at these small banks that power startup-friendly fintechs.  What’s going to happen if a deal to save SVB, the mothership of tech startup finance ,doesn’t come to fruition? Or, if depositors only get 40%-50% of their money back? It’s going to be a tech deep-freeze. Beware small banks.  “The gov’t has about 48 hours to fix a soon-to-be-irreversible mistake,” Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman tweeted on the weekend. “These withdrawals will drain liquidity from community, regional and other banks and begin the destruction of these important institutions.”  “Already thousands of the fastest growing, most innovative venture-backed companies in the U.S. will begin to fail to make payroll next week,” he continued.
