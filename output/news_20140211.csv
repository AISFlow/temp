42376886,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6fyB7,1392159072,Aria PC Technology Becomes Latest Computer Supplier to Accept Bitcoin,"Major UK-based PC component and hardware supplier Aria PC Technology is now accepting bitcoin for payments.  Aria was established more than 20 years ago, though its focus has shifted over the years from brick-and-mortar operations to e-commerce.  The e-tailer began accepting bitcoin on 7th February, choosing to mention the news as an aside in a Twitter post announcing the launch of the new Gladiator Mining Frame.    Introducing the Aria Bitcoin Mining Frame... plus... we are accepting Bitcoins as payment from Monday! http://t.co/wUxZTP3wQ3      — Aria PC Technology (@Aria_Technology) February 7, 2014    As a result, the decision came without the typical fanfare that has become common when major merchants add bitcoin payments.  Rather, the news spread slowly, ebbing out via social media and through message board discussions.  Product selection and checkout  Aria offers a wide range of computer components that can be used for specialty mining rigs, as well as traditional PCs, including fans and cooling accessories, processors, power supplies, hard drives and more. In addition, those who want to buy consumer goods will find Aria offers laptops, TVs and video game accessories, among other general electronic store fare.  Bitcoin purchasers who attempt to complete an order may first be surprised not to see bitcoin as a payment option at the ""Shopping Basket"" stage.  Rather, these shoppers must log in with their accounts and enter additional information before finding the option at the ""Payment & Confirmation"" stage of the checkout.  Industry impact  With the announcement, Aria becomes the latest computer-focused e-commerce company to add bitcoin as a payment option. The news notably follows TigerDirect's 23rd January decision to start taking the virtual currency.  TigerDirect's top products in the aftermath of the announcement were computer accessories, including video cards, power units and tablets, which may have convinced more tech merchants there is an overlap between their customer base and the currency's devoted user base.  Just last week Scan Computers, one of Britain’s biggest computer retailers, revealed that it would start taking bitcoins via BitPay.  As a result of these announcements and subsequent sales successes, it seems likely that more tech-focused merchants could follow suit.

42376873,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6fxw1,1392154363,Why Bitcoin’s Volatility Problem May Soon Be Solved,"Just weeks ago, media outlets like Bloomberg and TechCrunch were all but declaring an end to bitcoin’s price volatility.  Posts like ""Bitcoin’s Emerging Price Stability"" were widely circulated on the bitcoin forums, and research from Wall Street analysts like ConvergEx Group asserted that bitcoin was “on the road to stability”.  Then, overnight, all was quickly forgotten.  CNBC, the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, BusinessWeek and Business Insider pounced on the bitcoin ‘crash’ due to Mt. Gox’s technical issues. Further, outlets like the LA Times rushed to dig up quotes from outspoken bitcoin critics like, Mark Williams, who issued the follow statement to the New York State Department of Financial Services BitLicense panel:  ""Bitcoin is an experiment that needs to remain in the laboratory until it can meet the basic standards required to become a beneficial transaction currency.""  Here’s the thing. These critics are right, bitcoin is failing as a currency today.  That’s why I believe the next major bitcoin innovation won’t be a wallet app or a merchant tool, but rather a product or method that effectively separates bitcoin, the currency, from bitcoin, the speculative investment.  The next big thing  Sometime, hopefully soon, some person or company is going to figure out how to securitize the holding risks of bitcoin and guarantee the underlying purchasing power of consumer and merchant bitcoin deposits.  I’m not talking about ‘instant conversion’ tools offered by companies like BitPay and Coinbase, but rather products that allow depositors to safely and securely hold bitcoins that won’t fluctuate wildly in price. Ideally, depositors wouldn’t even know it, but they would be using this innovation to offload price volatility onto professional speculators with a higher risk tolerance.  In the process, bitcoin could begin acting like a currency for those who wish to use it as a unit of account for payments, while still preserving its properties as a high-beta investment. It’s a simple idea with a complex solution and a potentially lucrative payout.  Someone is bound to crack the problem eventually.  Two-faced currency  Bitcoin’s price swings stem from the fact that it is simultaneously ‘e-cash’ (a currency) and ‘e-gold’ (a means of investment). This is problematic because combining the two usually means that one isn’t acting as it should.  A stock with a 0% return is a poor investment, and a currency that can swing 10%+ or more in a day is a poor currency. Yet the ratio of bitcoin held for those vastly different purposes changes constantly and unpredictably.  Expectations of good news underpin investors’ rationale for treating bitcoin as a speculative investment that could skyrocket in value, and yet good news itself depends on consumers and merchants using bitcoin as a stable unit of account. It’s a circular reference.  A single bitcoin may end up with a value of $100,000 or it may crash to $0, but one thing is certain – it will not trade at a constant level in the long term. In that respect, critics are correct to say that bitcoin fails as a currency today. But will this always be the case?  Junk derivatives  Many believe the fix is a stronger derivatives market, but Coinbase’s Fred Ehrsam told Wired in January that the current “derivatives, futures, and options market is largely underdeveloped”, making today’s “counter-party risk unacceptable”.  In other words, today’s derivatives products are garbage.  And they could be for some time. Speaking from Munich at the DLD Conference, Circle’s Jeremy Allaire suggested that hedging products wouldn’t improve until central governments provided better regulatory clarity. Only then can large, well-capitalized financial institutions from financial meccas like New York and London build their own market-making platforms.  I’m sceptical, however, that a healthy, liquid derivatives market could materialize in the near-term to help individuals and smaller companies properly hedge against volatility. It is unlikely that small depositors would buy their own bitcoin futures, and even if they did, their coin would likely be expensive enough to offset any value gained from using the cryptocurrency as a payment system in the first place.  Besides, most of us consumers are used to low inflation, ‘sticky’ prices and stagnant wages. We simply aren’t conditioned to go the extra mile to protect the purchasing power of our savings.  Bring in the banks  What will really drive down bitcoin volatility are better methods for connecting bitcoin wallets to Wall Street banks and their abundant investment capital.  In an environment where some bitcoin-related startups struggle to open checking accounts, volatility innovators won’t face any shortage of hurdles (or critics from within the bitcoin community), but you can bet those challenges won’t dissuade them from trying to solve such an important problem.  Algorithmic trading platforms are already being built, which will improve liquidity and mop up some of bitcoin’s excess volatility, and it’s just a matter of time before a new intermediary builds the pipes that allow Wall Street to securitize all of bitcoin’s volatility.  There are ways to effectively separate bitcoin into both a currency and a volatile investment. There is an institutional market hungry to absorb the risks and soak up the rewards of bitcoin. There are talented teams of bitcoin technologists and finance entrepreneurs eager to build new products. And there is a clear regulatory framework slowly emerging from government authorities.  The table is set to truly change the way ordinary people interact with the underlying bitcoin technology. It’s no longer a question of whether these innovations are possible. Instead, it’s just a matter of when they will be available.  Ryan Galt is a blogger, entrepreneur and freelance opinion writer for CoinDesk. His opinions do not necessarily reflect CoinDesk’s.

42376871,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6fxtV,1392150014,Revel Systems Adds Bitcoin Option to its iPad Point-of-Sale Solution,"San Francisco-based iPad point-of-sale (POS) solution provider Revel Systems announced on 11th February that its merchant customers can now accept bitcoins as payment.  Merchants can elect to receive bitcoin via any of Revel's more than 7,000 terminals, which are in use at a variety of merchants from Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen to Goodwill thrift stores.  Founded in 2010, Revel Systems offers a range of POS solutions for quick-service restaurants, self-service kiosks, grocery stores and retail outlets, among other merchants. POS packages start at $3,000 plus a monthly fee for an iPad, cash drawer and scanner.  In a press release regarding the announcement, Revel Systems CTO and co-founder Chris Ciabarra explained his company's decision, stating:  ""As the standard in point-of-sale, we like to provide our customers with more ways to take advantage of consumer payment trends and supply a platform in which to take them, and that includes configuring our system to accept bitcoin.""  Ciabarra went on to say that Revel Systems believes that digital currencies are ""the wave of the future,"" and that its Revel app has been submitted to the Android and Apple app stores.  Revel Systems partnered with Coinbase for the move, integrating its hardware and software solutions into its POS offering. Interested merchants will need to create their own wallets to connect to the Revel POS, a spokesperson said.  On top of industry trends  CEO and founder Lisa Falzone also commented on the news, suggesting that the move was proof that the company stays on top of industry trends and allows merchants to profit from these market changes.  Falzone went on to suggest that merchant demand played a factor in the decision:  ""We like to give our clients options. We listen to their feature requests, and take those into account when releasing a new build.""  Evelyn Fong, the owner of San Francisco-based grocery outlet Five Markets, is one of the first merchants to take advantage of the offering, and so far, she told CoinDesk she is still introducing it to her customers.  ""It's going to be a really good option for my clients to pay me, since most come in with smartphones,"" Fong said.  A long-awaited decision  The formal announcement follows months of speculation that Revel Systems would soon incorporate bitcoin into its offerings. This December, Falzone projected that the rise of digital currency would be one of the defining trends of 2014.  ""This year the retail industry will see major shifts take place, whether it is the convergence of online eCommerce with brick-and-mortar retail, the rise of digital currency like PayPal and bitcoin at the checkout, or the integration of wearable data to help consumers make smarter choices at the checkout.""  So far, Falzone's prediction has proven accurate with more physical merchants, as well as large online retailers such as Overstock and Tiger Direct, adding bitcoin payments to their offerings.  Though, it remains to be seen if ongoing price volatility and misinformation could slow adoption.

42422940,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1ymzh,1392145693,The Pros and Cons of Bitcoin: a Merchant’s View,"William Coates is an entrepreneur and self-confessed 'tech nerd' with a background in software development. Currently based in Helsinki, he is CEO of Digital Tunes – an online music store which began accepting bitcoin early last year. Here, Coates tells of his experiences with the cryptocurrency and whether you should take your company down the same route.  We starting accepting bitcoin at digital-tunes.net at the start of 2013, and so far it has been an overwhelmingly positive experience. Bitcoin is now our third biggest payment provider by revenue, after credit cards and Paypal, and in front of ClickAndBuy and Skrill (previously MoneyBookers).  Over the last six months, 2% of our sales came via bitcoin, and on a good month the digital currency can account for as much as 4% of our total sales.  To be honest this is much, much more revenue than we thought we would see with the cryptocurrency. At the start of 2013, and still to some extent today, the common perception is that people only use bitcoins to buy drugs online.  We’ve found that this is clearly far from the truth – there is a growing and vibrant community of users from all across the world who want to trade their bitcoins for all kind of things.  Over the last year, we have discovered some important pros and cons with accepting bitcoin payments and have now made them the basis of this article. If your business is considering accepting bitcoin for the first time, we hope you can learn from our experiences.  The good things  Zero fraud  Fraud is currently a massive headache when accepting payments online. Chargebacks not only cause loss of revenue, but also an incredible amount of extra administrative work.  This is immensely frustrating for us: when we get chargebacks from non-European credit cards, we end up footing the bill – our credit-card processor doesn’t cover us.  The beauty of bitcoin is that fraud has been rendered an impossibility: due to the nature of the bitcoin protocol, all transaction are irreversible. Once you get paid, you get paid. This isn’t some short-term special offer or sleight of hand, this is baked into the code at the heart of the digital currency.  This is wonderful, as it means the responsibility for combatting fraud is not shouldered by the merchant, but instead lies with the bitcoin wallets – the ‘banks’, if you will, of digital currencies.  Low transaction fees  Transaction fees are fairly horrible with traditional payment providers, especially when it comes to smaller transactions, as there is often a minimum fee.  Let us, for example, consider the purchase of a music track costing 1.49 euro from our store. Paypal charges us 3.4%, plus a 35-cent fee for each transaction. So, in this case, Paypal would get 40 cents from this transaction: a 27% fee.  Now charges that high aren’t going to be sustainable for any low-margin business (they are probably fine if you are selling Bolivian marching powder, though!). To get round the problem, we at digital-tunes.net charge our customers a 35-cent surcharge on Paypal payments, to help us offset the exorbitant fees.  With bitcoin, transaction fees are entirely optional. The currency’s protocol allows you to set the transaction fee to zero if you so wish, however this might mean it takes a bit longer to process.  The idea behind bitcoin transaction fees is that the computers running the network (in an entirely distributed manner) get to keep the transaction fees associated with the transactions they have successfully processed.  It’s quite likely that, in the future, we will see the fees be determined by the market, and if you want your transaction processed as fast as possible, you will have to pay a premium. Currently, transaction fees are not the primary motivation for people to run the network, but that’s an entirely other topic. A useful graph showing the fees charged by the entire network over time can be viewed here.  In practise, most merchants would be wise to use an existing bitcoin payment processor because, due to the irreversible nature of the transactions, you need to make sure your security is rock solid. With bitcoin, the thieves can enter your store, steal every single bitcoin, and even if you know who did it and where the money went, you probably will never get it back (at least you won’t have been physically attacked, though – one of the joys of running an online-only store).  To process our bitcoin payments, we use BitPay, who take a flat 1% transaction fee (or 0%, if you opt for their $30/month fee option). Even a 1% fee is a huge improvement over the traditional payment providers today and, in addition, opens the door to micropayments, as there are no minimum fees.  Easy setup  If you use a bitcoin payment processor like Blockchain or BitPay, the actual implementation of payments is child’s play, and for us, took just one day. There are even services such as Shopify who have bitcoin integration built in, it’s just a matter of signing up for the service.  The bad things  Volatility, part 1.  Probably the biggest problem with bitcoin is the volatile nature of its value relative to fiat currencies such as dollars or euros.  We price the tracks on our store in euros, and the bitcoin value is calculated from the current exchange rate. This means that, if someone spends the equivalent of 100 euros in bitcoin on our store, then the value of bitcoin halves before we get a chance to convert it to euros, we lose 50 euros. Ouch.  However, BitPay provides a simple solution to this issue. If you choose to receive all payments in the fiat currency of your choice, such as euros, BitPay will instantly convert the payment to euros at the time of the transaction.  As a result, you will always receive the exact euro amount (minus fees) that your product was priced at. In this manner, it is possible to completely remove the volatility risk for merchants accepting bitcoin.  Volatility, part 2.  Although it’s easy enough to eliminate the volatility risk for merchants, we also have to think about how volatility could affect our customers’ buying behaviour.  One hypothetical problem is that, when the value of bitcoin is rising, people will be more likely to hold on to their coins rather than spend them. This ‘hoarding’ could obviously affect sales, at least in the short term.  On the flip-side, if the value of bitcoin crashes, you would also expect to see sales affected: a customer who converted 100 euros to buy tunes on our store will only have 75 euros to spend if the exchange rate has dropped 25% in the meantime.  Looking at our sales data for bitcoin, it’s quite clear that volatility does have an affect on customer behaviour.  During periods when bitcoin is quickly rising in value, no-one wants to spend their coins. This makes sense: why would you shop today, if tomorrow you can get a 10% discount? However, after these surges, we often see a spurt of bitcoin transactions: presumably since people suddenly have some spare cash to play with.  It’s worth noting, though, that even after crashes we do still see transactions occurring. So it’s clear there is an underlying level of demand that is not entirely correlated with the current exchange rate value of bitcoin.  Is it worth the plunge?  At digital-tunes.net, we are really happy with our experiences with taking bitcoin for payments. It can be super simple to set up, and the low transaction fees and zero fraud risk make the digital currency an attractive option.  Volatility is definitely the biggest issue at the moment, but I’m sure that as bitcoin grows, the volatility will taper off. It feels like we are witnessing bitcoin’s growing pains right now.  Even with the volatility as it is, there is a real opportunity awaiting merchants who accept bitcoin, and we were positively surprised with how many payments we’ve received in the cryptocurrency.  The truth is, bitcoiners aren’t just a bunch of nerds wanting to buy drugs online – out there is a vibrant international community of consumers who have realised the advantages of this new kind of money, and it’s growing day by day.

42376878,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6fy3Z,1392141036,Bitcoin Exchanges Under 'Massive and Concerted Attack',"A ""massive and concerted attack"" has been launched by a bot system on numerous bitcoin exchanges, Andreas Antonopoulos has revealed.  This has lead to popular exchange Bitstamp putting a temporary halt on all bitcoin withdrawals, and BTC-e announcing possible delays on transaction crediting.  Antonopoulos, who is the chief security officer of Blockchain.info, said a DDoS attack is taking Bitcoin's transaction malleability problem and applying it to many transactions in the network, simultaneously.  ""So as transactions are being created, malformed/parallel transactions are also being created so as to create a fog of confusion over the entire network, which then affects almost every single implementation out there,"" he added.  Antonopoulos went on to say that Blockchain.info's implementation is not affected, but some exchanges have been affected - their internal accounting systems are gradually going out of sync with the network.  He emphasised that this isn’t affecting withdrawals, because most exchanges are not processing them automatically.  Mt. Gox is the exchange that has suffered the most over the past few days, due to a number of factors, said Antonopoulos. One problem is that it was using a custom client (not the core Bitcoin software), on top of that there is the DDoS attack, plus it was using an automated system to approve withdrawals.  ""This is not happening to other exchanges because they're not stupid enough to issue withdrawals without checking them out first,"" he explained.  Antonopoulos said we will see a few exchanges suspend withdrawals temporarily while they re-work their accounting systems to ensure they are not confused by the attack.  ""It's important to note no funds have been lost. Withdrawals have been halted to prevent funds from being lost or to prevent the balances from going out of sync,"" he stressed.  Industry action  An industry-wide coordinated response has been put into action, with exchanges and core developers collaborating actively to attack the problem from multiple angles.  Various other groups within the ecosystem, including the big mining pools, are working to stop the issue from propagating across the network.  Any exchanges that are affected are working on fixing their internal systems so they correct the account balances and can resume withdrawals as soon as possible.  ""I would expect to see withdrawals flowing again within 24 and 72 hours, and in the meantime, any withdrawals that were cancelled will reappear in customer account balances,"" Antonopoulos explained.  Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik said the core bitcoin block chain consensus mechanism and payment system are continuing to work as before, and are not directly impacted by transaction malleability.  He added: ""Web wallets and other services that build services on top of bitcoin are reporting problems similar to MtGox, and are taking safety measures to ensure no fund loss, during this network disruption.  ""Yesterday's statement must be revised: we will likely issue an update fixing two edge cases exposed by this attack.""  Bitstamp has issued a statement explaining that it has temporarily halted BTC withdrawals. It begins:  Bitstamp’s exchange software is extremely cautious concerning Bitcoin transactions. Currently it has suspended processing Bitcoin withdrawals due to inconsistent results reported by our bitcoind wallet, caused by a denial-of-service attack using transaction malleability to temporarily disrupt balance checking. As such, Bitcoin withdrawal processing will be suspended temporarily until a software fix is issued.  The statement goes on to reveal that no funds have been lost, nor are any at risk.  BTC-e later issued a comment via Twitter, elaborating on its service interruption.    Due DDOS on Bitcoin network there is a delay possible with crediting of transactions madden between 10-11 February. Be patient please #btce      — BTC-E (@btcecom) February 11, 2014    Don’t panic  Antonopoulos was keen to stress that, although this is a serious attack, it doesn't spell the end of bitcoin. He believes the DDoS attack will be ""thwarted"" and exchanges will be running as usual by Friday.  ""I expect things will go back to normal and the honey badger of money can continue showing its resilience,"" he said.  ""The death of bitcoin has been prematurely announced so many times already that the obvious conclusion is that bitcoin is far more resilient than its critics would like to think. I am confident that in a few days, those who predicted the death of bitcoin will once again be proven wrong,"" Antonopoulos concluded.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/11/bitcoin-exchanges-under-massive-and-concerted-attack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/472d5efd9b635ec6f7b06d223d35ab2a94048aa6-1000x730.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376874,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6fxyX,1392139485,JPMorgan Report Slams Bitcoin as 'Vastly Inferior' to Fiat Currency,"Released on 11th February, a new report by US-based multinational financial services company JPMorgan issued a sharp critique of bitcoin and other digital currencies.      The eight-page report, authored by the company's head of global FX strategy, John Normand, aimed to present the ""risks and opportunities"" posed by bitcoin.    However, throughout the text, Normand puts much of his focus on the former category.    Most notably, Normand suggests that bitcoin is ""vastly inferior to fiat currencies"" on several counts, and that it is unlikely to ever be afforded the status of legal tender by world governments. The later quality, Normand says, casts the most doubt on bitcoin's future.      Normand writes:      ""As a medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value, it is vastly inferior to fiat currencies.            Since governments are quite unlikely to accord it the status of legal tender, bitcoin or other virtual currencies would not reach the scale and scope to render them worthwhile for widespread commerce, payments or investment.""              While Normand did acknowledge the appeal of bitcoin's technology – pointing out that fiat currencies could learn from its innovations – he ultimately concluded that ""bitcoin's practical role may be no larger than that of an emerging market's currency subject to exchange controls"".    Bitcoin as inferior money    Normand writes that there is much to dislike about bitcoin, first and foremost because it fails to meet traditional definitions of a 'medium of exchange' because it lacks a common power to compel its use.      Normand explains:      ""Recall that currencies don’t become widely used spontaneously or through a grassroots campaign. They become widely used nationally because a government declares them legal tender, and they become widely used internationally because they are legal tender in a significant economic area with large, unrestricted capital markets.""              Further, Normand suggested that, because of this deficiency, virtual currencies would need to be able to perform other functions more effectively than fiat currency as both a unit of account and a store of value, which he argues it does not.      Normand used bitcoin's price fluctuations, which he described as ""brutal,"" as an example to prove his assertion. He cited the statistic that bitcoin's volatility has averaged 120% over the last three years, while a typical G10 currency will range from 7% to 16%.      ""Such price fluctuations make it impossible to seriously consider bitcoin as a unit of account or store of value for an material amount of corporate or investor exposure,"" Normand wrote.      However, Normand did acknowledge that these ""swings"" may simply represent normal volatility for a startup currency, the same way startup companies in the 1990s saw strong fluctuations in share prices.    Bitcoin's implications for investors and corporations    Normand opened this section of the report by noting that saving 1% on transaction fees would be an attractive prospect for merchants. However, he stated that such savings would not outweigh the risk of the currencies volatility.      Normand did not mention that major processors such as BitPay and Coinbase limit merchants from this potentially harmful exposure, as he suggested bitcoin would complicate a company's cash and risk management.      As for bitcoin's biggest benefit for investors, its potentially large long-term value, Normand suggested that the currency displays many characteristics investors usually shy away from, and further that there is simply not a sufficient way to assess what bitcoin's future value would be:      ""Fundamental exchange rate models cannot be constructed for similar reasons: there is no meaningful bitcoin economy on which to base productivity or terms of trade calculations.""            Bitcoin's appeal    The author did indicate that he was able to see why people are attracted to the idea of a currency without the ""alleged recklessness, capriciousness, siphoning and snooping inherent in the traditional financial system"", adding that there ""is something"" to the idea.      Additionally, Normand noted that fiat currencies can learn from some of bitcoin's innovations. The currency offers predictable growth in the money supply and it eliminates the risk of capital controls. Bitcoin also provides verification of fund balances to avoid fraud and it reduces transaction costs.      ""As fanciful – and indeed Matrix-like – as this bitcoin creation system sounds, perhaps it requires no more suspended disbelief than the traditional fiat system in which a government declares paper to have value and a central bank or national mint thus issues the specie. One doesn’t need to be the caricatured miscreant, Austrian economist or anarchist to appreciate the appeal of such a system.""

42376892,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6fyG9,1392137724,"The Promise of Bitcoin Micropayments: Corporations, Incentives and Altcoins","On 3rd February, the Chicago Sun-Times, in partnership with BitWall, launched an experiment to see if people were willing to pay small amounts of bitcoin for articles over a 24-hour period.  This was done in the via the startup's bitcoin microtransaction paywall at which people were asked to donate coin in order to read content, as reported here.  There was a social media alternative as well, which allowed readers to tweet stories instead of paying, or even leave the site altogether by clicking ‘no thanks’.  The test run saw a total of 713 visitors paying – each donated as much bitcoin as they thought the content was worth. The newspaper found there was a payment sweet-spot, with 63% percent of the visitors who paid donating the equivalent of $0.25 each. The proceeds from the experiment went to a charitable organization called the Taproot Foundation.  Consequently, The Sun-Times, with the ninth largest news circulation in the United States, was able to validate a future that could involve virtual currency micropayments.  The impact of this could be huge for cryptocurrencies as a payment method – not just in publishing, but in all sorts of incentive-related activities.  Paying our problems away  If you are a regular to cryptocurrency websites, you'll already know that software engineer and entrepreneur Marc Andreesen envisages a future where digital currencies are a big part of everyday life.  Andreesen makes it his job to know about emerging business opportunities. After all, he is the person who foresaw a future for the internet as a web-based tool for the masses and then helped bring it about with his inventive Netscape browser.  More recently, his namesake venture capital firm Andreesen Horowitz has, in fact, invested in a number of bitcoin startups. The most visible of those was San Francisco-sited Coinbase – an online bitcoin wallet service, which received $25m in funding late last year.  In a lengthy op-ed published by the New York Times recently, Andreesen expounded upon an imagined future where bitcoin’s potential is used for a number of incentive-laden activities.  One of his innovative concepts was an email system that was based upon microtransactions and would involve charging a small fee for the transmission of an electronic message in an attempt to reduce the longstanding and unpopular problem of spamming. Even at such a low cost per message, you would certainly think twice before sending out a couple of million emails selling fake meds.  A number of other incentive-based ideas can be conjured up when thinking about concepts like Andreesen’s spam circumvention system.  Digital incentives could abound: waiting in a line for something could be eradicated via the use of micropayments to ensure a spot in the queue, for example.  The concept of cryptocurrency micropayments opens up a plethora of opportunities to possibly mitigate many of the negative elements of modern life that the internet has spawned: trolling, hacking and, again, unrepentant spamming.  Will it be bitcoin?  Marcell Ortutay is the developer behind CoinWall. His bitcoin micropayments system that doesn’t use a third party to process paywall transactions. He said:  “The big benefit of bitcoin is that it lets anyone participate in transactions without a third party. I feel like using third parties kind of takes away that benefit.”  The third parties Ortutay talks about are payment processors like Coinbase, which can be used to handle the transactional layer on behalf of businesses.  Operating with a third party can actually take away some risks a startup might face in the event of possible regulatory decisions. This makes it easier to run a cryptocurrency startup, since the fledgling company doesn’t have to deal with the nuts and bolts of their bitcoin/fiat transactions.  And that is a good thing, because doing so could potentially define a bitcoin-related company as a money transmitter from a regulatory standpoint.  If that were the case, it could be problematic for a startup operating with a limited amount of cash flow, since sanctions or banking-related business fees could ultimately drown any startup trying to promote decentralized virtual currencies directly.  Block chain bloat  Another problem is that with so many small transactions, the bitcoin block chain could, at some point, become unmanageable in size. Ortutay, the CoinWall proprietor, said:  “You don’t want to send a lot of tiny transactions over the network that will bloat the block chain – make it really big. That’s a problem. I think that’s a valid argument.”  Coinbase actually uses off the block transactions to process its daily bitcoin transmittals. The company then allocates them on the blockchain as much larger grouped transactions at a later point in time.  Ankur Nandwani, who runs the open-source micropayment system BitMonet, believes that developers are already working on solutions if the bitcoin blockchain does inflate to an unmanageable size. One of the ideas is called a ‘micropayments channel’, a concept that has been circulating for a long time.  “The bitcoinj library has added support for micropayments channels, which when implemented by different players in the bitcoin ecosystem, will do a lot to ease out the fears of microtransactions filling up the blockchain,” Nandwani said.  Specialized altcoins  In the future, there may be potential for a cryptocurrency that just focuses on tiny payments. Ortutay said:  “It would be nice if bitcoin just scaled to allow for lots of transactions.”  That said, there are already alternatives to bitcoin that could better serve the purpose. Litecoin, for example, is a faster transactional currency, running through blocks in 2.5 minutes as a opposed to bitcoin’s 10 minutes.  Dogecoin  could be another alternative. It is based on litecoin and has a large fanbase – frequently being used in development and online communities as a tipping mechanism. The only problem with dogecoin might be the vast number of coins in circulation, which could at some point have a negative affect on price.  Yet with dogecoin “more people are willing to tip, and more willing to spend their coins,” said Ortutay.  Corporate currencies?  Spending money on a micro scale, whether for content or other incentive-laden uses, could be a big component of the digital world going forward. And cryptocurrencies may well play a part, whether it's bitcoin, litecoin or another as-yet-to-be developed coin that is specifically focused on microtransactions.  With that in mind, it isn't too far fetched to suggest that the incumbent players in the payment industry might realise what they are up against and, in theory, eventually develop their own form of micropayment currency in their own interests.  In fact, that’s something PayPal’s parent company has already got a patent on, an idea of using virtual ‘tokens’. Such a system could be an effective way to circulate value in a digital form other than credit cards, the incumbent form of digital payments today.  Nandwani, whose BitMonet platform also has a coinbase-integrated mobile Android SDK for in-app transactions, sees a future where the big companies will want to get into the microtransactions game. It may even be one of the motivations behind Apple’s stance against apps that can conduct bitcoin transactions, but Nandwani believes that the more competition, the better:  “I think there is nothing stopping an established player from developing its own virtual currency.”  “In fact PayPal, AmEx and Western Union, which are closed looped payments system can easily do that within their network. And I think it would be good if they do that, as more competition is always good for the ecosystem,” he said.

We are always searching for ways to give people better access to bitcoin information, news, data and prices.  With bitcoin aficionados and entrepreneurs developing new bitcoin sites every day, we felt a price ticker that displayed the Bitcoin Price Index, updated in real-time, would be a useful widget for many people.  The widget displays the current Bitcoin Price Index, today's high and low, and a sparkline showing price movements over the last sixty minutes.  As announced yesterday, Mt. Gox has been dropped from the BPI due to its inability to meet the specified criteria (on account of its systemic withdrawal issues). The BPI team is currently assessing whether alternative bitcoin exchanges meet the criteria and can be included.  Using the Bitcoin Price Ticker widget means you will always be able to display an accurate reference price for bitcoin on your site.  Use the following code to embed the widget (210 x 130px) into your site:    <div id=""coindesk-widget""></div>  <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""//widget.coindesk.com/bpiticker/coindesk-widget.min.js""></script>      The widget is also available in a larger size (300 x 250px, as shown in the image below) by using the following code:    <div id=""coindesk-widget"" data-size=""mpu""></div>  <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""//widget.coindesk.com/bpiticker/coindesk-widget.min.js""></script>      Please download our README file for further information on how to use the Bitcoin Price Ticker widget.

42376887,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6fyDd,1392127292,Fiverr Teams Up With Coinbase to Pay for Services in Bitcoin,"UPDATE (16th February, 6:18 GMT): with more accurate information and comment from Fiverr.  It's amazing what people will do for five dollars.  However, offering your services on popular freelance microtasking site Fiverr could prove very lucrative, now the company has announced a partnership with payment processor Coinbase to accept payments in bitcoin.  Fiverr is a site where people do a surprising variety of jobs for prices starting at $5. Over the site's millions of listings this includes almost anything.  The front page alone has listings for two hours of 'Virtual Office Assistant' work, composing and recording a song, logo and icon designs, illustrations and short voice recordings. Freelancers can also offer larger jobs for higher amounts of money, sometimes up to $8,000.  Coinbase called Fiverr ""the world’s largest two-sided marketplace for services starting at $5,"" and ""The first large services marketplace to accept bitcoin,"" in announcing the new partnership on its blog.  Through the single act of signing up Fiverr, Coinbase has increased the number of things you can buy with bitcoin exponentially.  Update: According to Fiverr's own blog, payments to sellers will unfortunately not be made in bitcoin, with Coinbase converting them to dollars before handing out. The company says ""On the seller side, it’s business as usual. Revenue is earned and withdrawn in US dollars. The option to withdraw revenue in Bitcoin is currently not available on Fiverr.""  This will probably disappoint a lot of sellers, who would be happy to accept payment in bitcoin. A recent survey revealed that over 50% of IT professionals would choose to be paid in bitcoin if it were offered. Fiverr itself takes a 20% cut of all sales made through the site, so most sellers would probably prefer not to hand over more in transaction fees.  Popular freelancing hub  Started in 2009 and available in over 200 countries, Fiverr has been called ""one of the most useful sites on the internet"" by users and is one of the most popular freelance work hubs. About half the jobs offered are still at the $5 price point, and 15% of its sellers say Fiverr is their primary income source.  If you prefer, there are plenty of ways to find odd jobs for actual bitcoin out there as well, including Twitter's @bitcoinjobs feed, Reddit's /r/BitcoinJobs subreddit, Coinality, and a few smaller places here and there.  The size of jobs offered on Fiverr varies wildly, many falling into the ""would they really do all that for a fiver?"" category.  “Fiverr is one of the leading disruptors of the Gig Economy”, said Fiverr's Director of Business Development, Constantine Anastasakis.  “Our community is passionate about innovation and creativity and Bitcoin represents this spirit of innovation in the payment space. It is only natural that Fiverr will be in the forefront of marketplaces embracing this new digital currency and security standards.”  “Our partnership with Fiverr brings the community another step closer to broad consumer adoption of bitcoin,” added Adam White, Director of Business Development at Coinbase. “This further validates that cryptocurrencies are a trusted, widely accepted form of payment.”  Less noble people have also been known to use Fiverr to get extra reviews on Amazon and iTunes, or buy thousands of fake Twitter followers. The latter tactic is often used by celebrities, especially politicians.  We can only hope the bitcoin payment offer will be extended to sellers in future as well. Even after the crashes and shocks of recent months, $5 worth of bitcoin in February 2013 would be worth around $143 to you today (or $250 last December) – a deal much better than five bucks.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/11/fiverr-teams-up-with-coinbase-to-pay-for-services-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c46b3a496e4c4aba1d36a6088c7d06bc8ff27f25-989x592.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425418,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7bh,1392124131,Bitcoin Wins Best Technology Achievement at TechCrunch Awards,"Bitcoin has won the TechCrunch Best Technology Achievement award at the 2013 Crunchies.  The 7th annual award ceremony was held last night in San Francisco and it was put together by TechCrunch, Gigaom and VentureBeat.  The fact that TechCrunch readers voted for bitcoin probably caused a problem or two for the organisers. Satoshi Nakamoto was a no-show, so Peter Vessenes, Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, accepted the prize in his place.  The award was presented by Gigaom’s Tom Krazit and Khosla Venture's Keith Rabois. Here’s how TechCrunch explained the conundrum:  “Since no one person made bitcoin (or did they?) the award goes to the idea and the hard-working men and women around the world who are maintaining, mining, and improving the BTC protocol. It’s also an exciting time for economists who have suddenly become useful again as they try to explain the vagaries of currency pricing.”  TechCrunch went on to conclude that bitcoin is “almost mainstream” and that it seems like it is here to stay.  Although winning a Crunchie is no small feat, the last few weeks have been marred by bad news for cryptocurrencies. First there was Charlie Shrem, then a few regulatory problems and bans, and then came the Mt. Gox freeze.  However, there were some positive developments that can't be overlooked. Microsoft’s Bing search engine added a bitcoin converter just the other day.  Several big merchants  have gotten on board over the past few weeks and the New York bitcoin hearings ended on a high note, although they were overshadowed by the Shrem affair.  Increased coverage  The sheer amount of coverage has increased, too. Bitcoin is no longer reserved for specialised publications and tech sites, as mainstream media sites show increasing interest in the fledgling currency.  Financial institutions are looking into bitcoin too, and some have already issued relatively positive reports on the currency and the future of digital currencies in general.  Bitcoin still has its ups and downs, but it is easy to argue the biggest positive development on the public relations front does not have anything to do actual news.  The fact that the media focus is no longer on price and speculation means that interest is now shifting to more serious issues like real world applications of digital currencies and regulatory issues.  In other words, attention seems to be shifting toward the areas that are integral to the growth of the bitcoin economy as a whole.

42425416,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7Vh,1392117461,57% of Brits Are Aware of Bitcoin,"More than half of Brits are aware of bitcoin, a new survey by communications agency Clarity has revealed.  According to the poll, 57% of the 2,000 online shoppers quizzed had heard about the digital currency. Men were more familiar with it than women, with 69% of men having heard of bitcoin versus 45% of women.  However, the survey also revealed only 5% of Britons have experimented with cryptocurrencies and most are not interested in using them, either. Just one in five said they would consider using them in the future. Some 7% of the men questioned had bought bitcoin, compared with only 2% of women.  Hurdles hampering mainstream adoption  So what’s hampering mainstream adoption? Uncertainty would be an easy way of explaining the sentiment. Only 18% said they would use digital currencies in the future. The problem for 63% of respondents is that they do not know enough about digital currencies, while 52% said they have no experience of using them.  Security was the top concern for 52% of respondents, while 43% said they did not trust the protocol and 29% questioned the legality of using digital currencies.    The survey found that 29% of people would not use digital currencies at all, while 29% said they do not know whether they will ever try a digital currency.  ""There’s no doubt that bitcoin is an exciting innovation. Yet recent claims that it’s becoming mainstream are wide of the mark. These results show that there’s a long way to go before bitcoin or any of the other digital currencies achieve anything like a critical mass with consumers. Issues around security, price volatility and usability are among the challenges facing the developers,"" Jason Navon, co-founder of Clarity, told the Telegraph.  Earlier surveys point to similar concerns  A recent survey carried out by The Street found that 79% of American consumers would consider using digital currencies, citing various concerns. A Bloomberg survey found that just 42% of Americans know what bitcoin actually is.  Most surveys tend to prove cryptocurrency stereotypes. Geeks and tech professionals love them, youths are a lot more open to the idea of using digital currencies, men tend to experiment with them a lot more often than women, but most people are not willing to give them a go and most people aren’t well informed, either.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/11/57-of-brits-are-aware-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd0a4d1db1cf8c9cefe9d909793436d680829c51-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425420,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7dh,1392078210,Community Outrage Marks Latest Chapter in Mt. Gox Story,"Following Mt. Gox's decision to abruptly suspend all bitcoin withdrawals on 7th February, many industry commentators and observers, CoinDesk included, began to feel the writing was on the wall for bitcoin's first and once-largest exchange.  But, despite the results of our extensive reader survey and critiques from industry heavyweights like Andreas Antonopoulos, there were those who maintained that given its industry reputation, the company's critics may have been premature in their statements.  However, Mt. Gox's future may be even more uncertain after controversial statements issued Monday further damaged the company's reputation and industry standing.  The comments, which blamed inherent problems with the bitcoin protocol for the withdrawal delays, ignited a veritable firestorm of anger on message boards, much of which was directed at Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles.  Karpeles' critics alleged he failed to take responsibility for his exchange's technical failures and management limitations. A swift rebuke from other industry thought leaders soon followed, with many saying that Mt. Gox was being deceptive by blaming previously known issues for its delays.  In reddit posts, some community members even went so far as to call for Karpeles' resignation from the Bitcoin Foundation, of which he is a board memberhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/about/board.  At press time, the Bitcoin Foundation has not responded to requests for clarification regarding Karpeles' standing within the organization.  Regardless, some industry observers believe that the intent of the statements may not matter.  Boston University professor Mark T. Williams  suggested that there will be little Mt. Gox can do to stem the damage. Speaking more broadly of virtual currency companies in a still developing market, he said:  ""They're really only as strong or as weak as their reputation. And once they've lost their reputation, it's almost impossible to rebuild.""  The bitcoin community reacts  Following the announcement, the Bitcoin Foundation moved to contradict Mt. Gox and Karpeles' statements, though it did recognize the underlying problem of transaction malleability they cited has still yet to be completely fixed.  The Foundation said in a press release:  ""The issues that Mt. Gox has been experiencing are due to an unfortunate interaction between Mt. Gox's implementation of their highly customized wallet software, their customer support procedures and their unpreparedness for transaction malleability, a technical detail that allows changes to the way transactions are identified.""  Even controversial members of the bitcoin community, such as BitInstant's former CEO Charlie Shrem, called for Karpeles to step down from the organization:  ""I resigned for this exact reason. I did not want my own issues to get dragged into the Foundation, an organization that I founded. At this point, I have no involvement with the Bitcoin Foundation.""  Some community members alleged that the comments were meant to buoy confidence in Mt. Gox's service, not harm the community, while others went so far as to suggest that the exchange intentionally crashed prices in an attempt to profit from a later recovery.  Bitcoin developers calm user concerns  The development community also distanced itself from Mt. Gox's statements, downplaying the severity of its claims. Bitcoin core developer Greg Maxwell suggested that Mt. Gox was spinning the news to its own benefit, but provided evidence that the problems the company addressed are not only real, but that they may take a long time for developers to address.  ""These characteristics are annoying but don’t inhibit basic operation. They are slowly being fixed – but fixing them completely will likely take years as they require changing all wallet software.""  Andreas Antonopoulos, Blockchain's chief security officer, moved to calm its users about the issue as well, calling the problem a ""known implementation issue"" that would not affect users of its bitcoin wallets.  Bitcoin exchanges weigh in  The leaders of other major exchanges were quickly besieged with requests for comments on the ongoing drama, and all downplayed concerns. Leon Li, CEO and founder of China-based Huobi, shared his views with Forex Magnates, suggesting that Mt. Gox was presenting the problem as larger than necessary.  ""Wallets sometimes experience small technical problems, but all of them can be fixed and thus won’t cause large-scale withdrawal problems,"" he said.  Jesse Heaslip  , CEO of Bex.io, the maker of white-label bitcoin exchange software, told CoinDesk that Mt. Gox's technical limitations were the cause of the issues:  ""This is the real issue, their software was repurposed from a Magic card trading site to a Bitcoin trading site. Also some of the language choices were OK for when it was built (Facebook was mostly on PHP back in 2009 too), but they haven't upgraded since then whereas Facebook has rewritten the majority of the platform in more scalable languages.""  Jaron Lukasiewicz  , CTO at New York-based forex trading platform Coinsetter, told CoinDesk that he agrees with the official response from the Bitcoin Foundation:  ""Bitcoin itself is completely fine. I fully agree with Gavin and his team’s response.""  Rich Teo, CEO at itBit, said: “Recently, at least one bitcoin exchange has found a flaw in the way they watched transactions on the block chain. This is not a problem with bitcoin or the Bitcoin software, but the way the exchange was watching the transaction for completeness.”  “itBit does not watch transactions in this way, and malleability of transactions does not affect deposits or withdrawals at itBit,” he added.  Major bitcoin indexes remove Mt. Gox  The reaction from major bitcoin price indexes may have been the most damaging to Mt. Gox, as the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index was far from the only major price tracker to swiftly remove the once once-dominant exchange from its offerings.  Cryptocoin charts not only barred Mt. Gox from its charts and orderbooks, but offered a reprimand of its actions:  ""Today Bitcoin Exchange Mt. Gox made a press release which harmed the whole Bitcoin Network and everybody who is working with it. Price dropped heavily because of [fear, uncertainty and doubt] FUD spread by Mt. Gox.""  BitcoinAverage announced its removal of the service via GitHub and Twitter.    We've removed mtgox's data from our calculations until such time as BTC withdrawals are resumed      — BitcoinAverage (@BitcoinAverage) February 10, 2014    A history of turbulence  While the future of Mt. Gox remains uncertain, what is more clear is that this is just the latest setback for a major company that once saw 80% of all trading activity occur on its platform.  For a detailed history of Mt. Gox's ups and downs, view our complete timeline here.
