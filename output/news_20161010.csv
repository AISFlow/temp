42378864,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mJTv,1476104960,Bitcoin Mining is a Family Business for This Father and Son,"In Raleigh, North Carolina, a father-and-son team are bucking the trend of industrial bitcoin mining.  Bitcoin mining is a highly energy intensive process in which competing parties race to add the next block or batch of transactions to the blockchain. The reward for doing so is 12.5 BTC – just under $7,700 at a bitcoin price of $615.  It’s that pursuit for fresh bitcoins that led Jason Gantt and his father Vernon to pursue a mining operation of their own. They operate two bitcoin mines out of their respective homes, with a third one currently under construction.  In some ways, the North Carolina operation harkens back to the old days of bitcoin mining. Back then, hobbyists at home would build a rig, connect to the network, start hashing and, with a dash of luck, scoop up some bitcoins of their own.  But mining has changed over the years. Driven by competition, climbing costs and an ever-escalating network difficulty, the most successful mines are the ones that scale the most effectively. As such, the average mine has evolved from a handful of computers at home to data center-based operations in which hundreds of machines are simultaneously grinding away. What’s more, these operations have grown more prevalent in areas with the most competitive power costs, taking operators to places like the river valleys of Washington or the mountains of Tibet.  That's not the case for the Gantts, who built their mines in the suburbs of North Carolina's state capital. The two have been cataloging their efforts on YouTube, offering a glimpse of how the two deal with the day-to-day ups and downs of mining digital currency.  According to Jason, it’s an experience that evolved from a hobby to an investment pursuit to a full-blown career. It’s also one that builds on their past experience working in the home water and heating industry.  He told CoinDesk:  “It wasn’t until I hit my first block when I had some [AntMiner] S7s, that I told my father about it. He became very interested, was asking all sorts of questions about what bitcoin is and whatnot. And so, he thought it was a great idea and wanted to go big. So that’s how we got our start.”  Early efforts  Jason told CoinDesk that the origins of the family mining business date back to 2010, when he first began experimenting with the digital currency and acquired his first bitcoins. In interview, he lamented that he hadn’t bought more at the time, echoing the comments of many early adopters.  Technical tragedy would soon strike, however, when the private keys for those early coins became lost during a computer replacement.  “So I lost [the bitcoins], and that point, ASICs were coming on the scene so I kind of stayed out of it until about probably 2014,” Jason explained.  Helping them through the early days was their collective experience working on electrical, plumbing and home heating systems professionally. This, Vernon said, gave them “an understanding of what these machines require”.  First came the mine at Jason’s home, followed by a second site hosted by Vernon. The two turned primarily to the AntMiner line of mining hardware, procured from Bitmain in China.  According to Jason, those early efforts have resulted in an operation that, overall, produces roughly 600 terahashes per second in mining capacity. Revenue wise, the two said that they produce about $9,000 per month, after expenses, paying an average of six and a half cents per kilowatt hour in that time.  The trials of mining  But those returns, early as they may be, didn’t come easy.  Those who have mined bitcoins at home know that it’s not simply a process of plugging in the machine, standing back and watching it print you magic internet money.  It’s a process more akin to babysitting. Miners need to keep a close watch on their machines, checking and optimizing performance, watching those ever-precarious temperatures and remaining vigilant for power shortages, technical problems and anything else that might interrupt the process.  Like those who’ve come before them, David and Vernon have dealt with their share of troubles. A recent video on their YouTube channel detailed one particular issue with power transformers.  “His transformer blew multiple times, and my transformer blew multiple times over the summer when it grew too hot,” Jason said in interview.  Those problems wouldn’t stop with the power.  More recently, the two encountered a bit of flooding as a result of Tropical Storm Hermine, which struck the East Coast US early last month. In one video dubbed “our mining pool lol”, Jason and Vernon detail the spate of flooding problems experienced at one of their mines.  Looking ahead  As can be expected, the future of the Gantt family bitcoin mining operation lies in growth. More machines, bigger capacity and more sophisticated cooling mechanisms are on the agenda, the latter of which constitute the most immediate concern, the two said in interview.  The mining process has also shifted, slightly, to include capacity for other digital currencies as well. One of the mines plays home to an ethereum rig, built using graphics cards.  According to Jason and Vernon, the two are looking to speed up their efforts by bringing in additional investors – though the scope and scale of that involvement hasn’t been entirely figured out.  Jason explained:  “We’re currently considering adding one or two investors to possibly speed things up. We’re in talks with one, but they kind of want more than we’re willing to give. We’ll possibly do crowdfunding to get to that point.”  The goal: 15 petahashes per second by the end of the year, an ambitious target that will be largely determined by the success of the third bitcoin mine. But they won’t be alone, says Jason. When in doubt, the two say they’ve turned to bitcoin’s online community for assistance when they hit a wall in their mine development efforts.  “The bitcoin community is the most amazing community, of such friendly, helpful people,” said Jason. “If there’s ever been a question, I simply ask and someone is always ready to lend a hand.”  Images via YouTube",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/10/10/bitcoin-mining-is-a-family-business-for-this-father-and-son,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49ab43e525465134a50d50f314fd10edcdad3780-1500x701.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378879,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mJfF,1476101663,Credit Unions Turn to Blockchain Amid Increasing Competition,"A less-discussed type of financial entity, the credit union service organization (CUSO), has emerged as an unlikely – but significant – player in the industry’s CU Ledger blockchain initiative.  In fact, to say that the involvement of CUSOs in broader credit union collaborations on blockchain has been a surprise wouldn’t shock may long-time industry observers.  Part of the trend is is simply pure business. With the number of credit unions in the US declining by about 250 institutions per year, this means CUSOs are competing for a ever-smaller piece of the pie.  But the advent of distributed ledger technology has brought several CUSOs together with more than 50 credit unions on the CU Ledger initiative, a development whose significance isn’t lost on industry veterans.  Robert Hackney, president of Card Services for Credit Unions (CSCU), an organization with around 2,000 credit union members, notes that these steps represent a “first” for his group and many of its peers.  Hackney told CoinDesk:  “It’s not that there’s bad blood or we’d let competition get in the way, but I think it’s the first time there’s [a technology] that really facilitates a collaborative effort.”  CUSOs are entities owned by federally chartered and insured credit unions that focus on a core competency, such as payment card processing services or business loan originations. Because credit unions tend to be smaller in size, CUSOs serve as a way for a group of these institutions to pool their resources to provide better, cheaper and new services to their members.  So while credit unions themselves don’t shy away from collaboration, CUSOs haven’t seen a reason to work together.  While blockchains have been lauded for their combination of cryptography, time-stamped accounting and data management, for permissioned ledgers to really see their full potential, Hackney acknowledges that competing entities will need to drop some old customs.  “It’s technology that we all may be able to use. That’s why we’re working together,” Hackney said.  The involvement of CUSOs in the industry is also a sign of its shift from possible applications for retail payments to the edges of financial systems. The CU Ledger initiative, for example, is focusing on utilizing smart contracts and finding a solution for user-centric digital identity.  Why identity?  With it’s user-focused mentality, self-sovereign identity fits well into the credit union’s narrative.  Developing “user-centric identity could solve a lot of problems in banking,” said Dean Young, senior vice president of industry engagement at Payment Services for Credit Unions (PSCU), another CUSO that’s a part of the CU Ledger project.  The main problem? Fraud.  “Imagine a world where … there’s 100% certainty that someone making a transaction is who they are,” said Young.  A sleeker identity system could also be helpful as it relates to the decreasing number of credit unions. Many times, credit unions merge or get acquired by other credit unions because it allows them to scale while also making revenue within a cumbersome regulatory environment, said Hackney.  Because of that, “it’s not uncommon for a credit union to have its credit portfolio with us (CSCU) and its debit portfolio with PSCU,” he said. “So if there are ways to authenticate through different portfolios and different providers that would be very beneficial in this environment.”  Destiny control  In that view, the credit unions and their service providers stand to potentially benefit by using the technology. But what about the members themselves?  According to Young, the answer lies in the portability of a single digital ID, which could eliminate the need for managing hundreds of username and password pairs.  That, and the ability to exert far greater control over that information.  That kind of individual control is one of the reasons the credit union industry decided to build it’s own ledger system, working on an identity proof of concept with Evernym, a startup based in Salt Lake City.  “The ability for the credit union movement to create a ledger and control its own destiny is more appealing than some avenues we looked at,” Young said.  Looking ahead  The traditional banking industry’s more competitive nature might be one reason no commercial blockchain product has launched in the financial services space as of yet. But the Cu Ledger group is working on a short timeline for implementation.  The CU Ledger effort plans on having a proof-of-concept up and running by the first quarter or early second quarter of next year, according to Young.  The effort is fueled by fees paid by those taking part in the project. To be a part of CU Ledger, the founders asked for a minimum investment of $10,000 per participant. But since that could be a challenge for some smaller credit unions, the terms were flexible, said Young.  “Collaboration is foundational in this industry, Young said. “This is not just a PSCU commercial solution. We don’t believe in a ‘build it and they will come’ philosophy but more of a philosophy of ‘build it together and then they’re already here.’”  The presence of CUSOs such as CSCU and PSCU, along with credit union participants and their members, should jumpstart adoption when the time comes. Since the two CUSOs work with more than half of all credit unions in the US, the kind of integration needed largely exists as-is.
