42401143,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLn7a,1519167608,Dutch Bank ING Says Crypto Exchange Bitfinex Is An Account Holder,"ING confirmed Tuesday that cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex has an account with the Dutch bank.  According to Bloomberg News and Reuters, a spokesperson for the financial services company acknowledged Bitfinex's account but declined to share any other information, citing confidentiality. The reports made no mention of Tether, the affiliated company behind the USDT token at the center of much of the controversy surrounding Bitfinex.  The ING spokesperson did, however, state that the bank performed ""more extensive due diligence"" on transactions conducted by cryptocurrency companies, though this did not extend to companies which occasionally transact with cryptocurrencies.  According to Bloomberg, he said in an email:  ""With companies that are active in the crypto market we are very reserved … not with companies that are in traditional markets and receive or do payments with cryptocurrencies, but with parties that are in the chain of cryptocurrencies.""  This marks the first major financial firm to confirm a working relationship with Bitfinex since Wells Fargo suspended transactions early last year. Since then, Bitfinex has apparently operated without a major banking partner until it opened its account with ING.  It remains unclear when this account was opened, though a Dutch-language investigative journalist website called ""Follow the Money"" implied there was a relationship between the two entities in a report from Feb. 14.  Bloomberg reported that Bitfinex may have had an account with the Polish Bank Spoldzielczy late last year, but this relationship was not confirmed.  A spokesperson for ING did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42401135,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLmxk,1519164921,US Securities Regulator Rejects BitConnect Records Request,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has denied a Freedom of Information Request (FOIA) on the BitConnect cryptocurrency investment scheme, citing an exemption usually applied to records tied to law enforcement.  The FOIA was sent by Florida lawyer David Silver, who though the law firm Silver Miller is representing clients in one of a number of lawsuits filed against BitConnect in recent weeks. Silver had previously sought a FOIA in relation to the controversial blockchain project Tezos, only to receive an identical rejection letter on Feb. 6.  As is the case with such letters, the SEC did not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation, and the letter itself is not proof that an active investigation is taking place. That said, Silver – who provided a copy of the newest letter to CoinDesk – said that he had been contacted by investigators from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding BitConnect, interpreting that as evidence that an inquiry is underway at the U.S. commodities trade regulator.  A representative for the CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  ""The SEC and CFTC’s decision to investigate BitConnect is far from surprising. The thousands of people who have contacted me over the last month have lost collectively over $1 billion,"" Silver told CoinDesk in an email, adding:  ""As investors in cryptocurrency have begun to understand, where you invest and store your money is critical in this space. ""Here today, gone tomorrow"" is a scary mantra, whether it be at exchanges like BitConnect, BitGrail, Kraken, or CoinCheck. Customers need to feel secure in their exchange of choice.""  As previously reported by CoinDesk, BitConnect was the subject of several cease-and-desist notices from U.S. state regulators, which cried foul ahead of a planned initial coin offering. The situation came to a head in mid-January when the team behind BitConnect announced that it would end its lending platform – a key characteristic of what many have described as a Ponzi scheme or an outright fraud – in a move that sent the value of the BCC token plunging.  As of press time, BCC is trading at roughly $3.58, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42401138,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLn1g,1519162236,What We've Learned About Venezuela's Cryptocurrency,"The government of Venezuela published several guides Tuesday in support of the presale for its ""petro"" cryptocurrency.  Announcing the oil-backed token as a form of legal tender that can be used to pay taxes, fees and other public needs, the Venezuelan government outlined its plans and expectations for the petro in a new website built for the cryptocurrency and launched today with the start of the token's pre-sale. The website is hosted by the country's Ministerio del Poder Popular para Educacion Universitaria Ciencia, Tecnologia (MPPEUCT).  The petro's price will depend on the price of a barrel of Venezuelan oil from the previous day, according to the government's website.  The presale, which was announced last month, launched Tuesday morning, as CoinDesk previously reported. Though more than 100 million petros are expected to be released ultimately, initially, only 82.4 million will be disbursed.  It's the first digital currency to be issued by a federal government – yet the initiative itself has long attracted criticism, including from lawmakers both inside and outside of the country. It was first unveiled by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in early December.  The buyer's manual explains how users can set up digital wallets and purchase the token, and includes a warning to users about wallet security. For full details on how the token works, the government released the full white paper (a notable release given that the government, just over a month ago, was blasting the release of what it said were fake details).  Though the third embedded document is titled ""Guidelines for the internal control manual for the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism,"" the full file is only a table of contents and does not include the guidelines that the Venezuelan government plans to follow.  NEM or ETH?  The document release also offers new insight into a key detail: which blockchain the petro token will utilize as a payment rail. Indeed, the white paper confirms that, initially, the petro will exist as a token on top of ethereum, relying on the ERC20 token standard.  ""The Presale will begin on February 20, 2018 and will consist of the creation and sale of an ERC20 token on the [blockchain] of the ethereum platform. This process will promote and guarantee demand for the Petro Initial Offer, which will be made later,"" it states.  But notably, the buyer's manual claims that ""the PTR token will work on the chain of NEM blocks"" during its pre-sale, referring to the blockchain network launched in 2015 that saw more than $500 million of its cryptocurrency stolen from exchange platform Coincheck in late January.  Per the buyer's guide, ""the wallets and programming elements are related to this technological platform.""  It's not entirely clear why there is a discrepancy between the two documents. It's possible that the petro will indeed be built on top of the NEM network, only to be later swapped for the ERC20-based ones once the sale is in full swing.  Alternatively, Venezuela could be using some kind of NEM-derived code in order to underly a wholly new ledger. A representative for the NEM Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Looking ahead  With the sale launched, observers will have to wait and see what kind of attention it attracts.  Per a roadmap published on the petro website, Venezuela plans to launch an exchange for the token next month, when it will also begin a private sale of the token. The government also aims to complete any adjustments necessary for its network by the end of March, with full use of the token expected to begin in April.  Yet the controversial token, as mentioned previously, has attracted its share of opponents, including members of the opposition-controlled Congress in Venezuela. In past comments to the media, one lawmaker called it ""illegal"" and accused it of serving as a vehicle for corruption.  In the U.S., some senior lawmakers have expressed concern about the use of the petro to avoid economic sanctions that have been imposed on the country. Senators Marco Rubio (R.-Fl) and Bob Menendez (D.-NJ) asked the U.S. Treasury Department in January to monitor and restrict the token.

42401137,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLmzi,1519155918,Report: Japanese Crypto Exchanges Unite to Form Self-Regulatory Group,"A group of Japanese cryptocurrency exchanges is reportedly uniting to form a new self-regulatory body in the wake of the recent Coincheck hack.  According to Reuters, which cites unnamed sources close to the group, 16 exchanges are making the move to self-regulate after the Coincheck exchange had $533 million-worth of NEM tokens stolen in a security breach in January. The new organization could be announced as soon as next week, the report suggests.  The sources said a plan to merge two existing groups – the Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association and Japan Blockchain Association – could not be agreed upon, and that the exchanges had opted to form a new organization that would be registered with the country's financial watchdog, the Financial Services Association (FSA).  The news comes days after it was announced that the FSA will conduct on-site inspections at 15 unlicensed cryptocurrency exchanges in light of the Coincheck theft. It is as yet unclear whether those exchanges are behind the new self-regulatory body, or whether Coincheck, which is not licensed, is part of the founding group.  The FSA has previously ordered all exchanges in the country to report on their security protocols and resistance to hacking in response to the Coincheck theft.  Since September 2017, following new legislation, the FSA has been issuing licenses to some of the country's crypto exchanges. Others that had filed for licenses, but had not been approved, were allowed to keep on functioning on a provisional basis.

42401118,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLlou,1519152303,Lisk Relaunches Blockchain Project With 'Accessibility' in Mind,"The team behind the Lisk blockchain network is hosting a relaunch event in Berlin on Tuesday, boasting a new look and long-term plan for the project.  ""Rebranding normally only involves a change of design, but we, while being in that process, determined that we need to change much more,"" Max Kordek, Lisk's co-founder and CEO, told CoinDesk.  At an event set for 7:30 p.m. CET, the startup will roll out a new front-end design, wallet and dashboard. The idea, Kordek said, is to improve accessibility for users who may be less familiar with using the various tools associated with cryptocurrency management – as well as those who know their way around the tech.  ""In the beginning, it was really more like a tech project,"" Kordek said. ""Now we're more about enabling people, about giving access to them, because blockchain technology is such an amazing thing. We basically want to distribute it to the people to make it accessible so that everyone can build on it.""  Lisk first debuted in mid-2016 as a fork of the Crypti blockchain, netting 14,000 BTC in an initial coin offering that May. Per data from CoinMarketCap, LSK is now the seventeenth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which as of press time hovered around $2.87 billion.  Two-prong approach  Kordek says that Lisk's approach to improving accessibility has two components.  For one, the team wants to create a better platform for users and developers that are already a part of the existing community. Last week, Lisk unveiled a fund that will support the development of ""high-quality sidechains"" to accompany the main network. Kordek wrote in a blog post that he has committed 1,700,000 LSK to the initiative and that investments will be made in the range of 5,000 to 500,000 euros.  At the same time, Lisk is seeking to court new users as well.  ""We also have to attract new people, and these people don't know anything about blockchain. So we also have to find ways that we can teach and educated them about this technology so that they see the advantages,"" Kordek explained.  Lisk hopes to facilitate user accessibility in part by prioritizing the user experience of its cryptocurrency wallet such that ""new users can be on-boarded faster and can jump right into the whole ecosystem much quicker.""  Additionally, the Lisk team says it will announce plans to create a blockchain ""academy"" today, with an eye toward using it as an education hub for the tech.  ""Apple, of course, had to teach the world how to use an iPhone,"" Kordek said. ""So we have to do something similar. We need to teach the people first what is the blockchain, what are the advantages, and then how to use our wallet or our ecosystem.""

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said that the meeting would involve representatives from central banks as well as the bloc's market supervisors. Though unnamed, Dombrovskis said that ""market players"" would also be invited to speak.  He said at the presser:  ""Next week, on [Feb. 26] I will chair a high level roundtable on virtual currencies. The Commission has invited key authorities, including central banks and supervisors, as well as market players to share their insights.""

The timing of the event is a notable one, given that some European leaders – including France and Germany – have called for more discussions around the topic.  Monday's ""roundtable"" also comes on the heels of discussions among U.S. lawmakers and regulators about the potential need for expanded oversight of the market (though other officials have said that any move in that direction won't happen soon).  It's possible that at least some of those at the roundtable will skew toward a harsher stance on regulation, as perhaps evidenced by the warning issued earlier this month by three market watchdogs – the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA).

42401125,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLltp,1519146025,Game Over: Crypto Vigilante Shuts Down Twitter's Favorite Dapp,"A red-hot ethereum game is off the market, collapsing Tuesday in a complex tale involving crypto-economics, community backlash, and finally, a sudden takeover.  Launched just earlier this month, Crypto All Stars was an instant hit, with over $2 million in ether passing between users, according to data from dappradar.com. Like CryptoKitties before it, Crypto All Stars allowed users to trade digital cards adorned with original designs, however this time, there was a twist, one tailor-made for community engagement.  A digital marketplace for Twitter’s favorite crypto personalities, Crypto All Stars allowed users to trade the likenesses of the technology’s biggest names, from litecoin creator Charlie Lee to AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant to infamous blogger Bitfinex’d.  And in its week-long run, the game became something of a small meme sensation – bouncing only 100,000 views below its competitor, CryptoKitties, according to site data from alexa.com.  But while the platform attracted its share of fans, it also garnered critics who questioned whether it was designed with the proper incentivizations at play.  Indeed, one user seems to have become so disenfranchised with the game that they ultimately purchased it only to shut it down. At press time, the Crypto All Stars website no longer displays its original advertising, but rather a message from its pseudonymous buyer explaining why the popular game will no longer be available.  Written by “Mexicantarget,” the post has become the talk of Twitter, as it alleges that the original founders were simply out to scam unsuspecting buyers.  Mexicantarget wrote:  ""I've been fighting against scum like you who create Ponzis and get people in sh*t … I'm getting really sick from situations like this, where poor suckers invest in schemes like yours and get burned.""  To this lone assailant, Crypto All Stars wasn’t simply another fun way to use the ethereum blockchain, but a clever way to pit users against each other for the founders' gain. To industry observers, however, it's perhaps yet another head-scratching moment for the technology.  As founder of the project Adam Hadar wrote on Twitter:  “A South Park character, a man with a mask of anonymous and a real person enter a bar and 7 days later...#crypto”  The buildup  Stepping back, it was easy to see why Crypto All Stars was able to quickly gain mindshare.  One of a handful of games that sprung up in the hype around CryptoKitties, so-called ""crypto collectables"" had been praised as showcasing a valuable use case for the ethereum blockchain – unique digital collectables created with the tech standard ERC-721.  Even ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin celebrated the cats, saying the game ""illustrate[s] very well that the value of a blockchain extends far beyond applications that would literally get shut down by banks or governments if they did not use one.""  In a similar vein, crypto talking heads came out bullish about Crypto All Stars.  “I’m fascinated with @cryptoallstarz. The more I think about it, the more I’m convinced it could become more than just a game; a sort of prediction market for crypto community,"" said Maciek Laskus, developer of a crypto influencers analytics site, on Twitter.  According to an archived image of the game's website, when Crypto All Stars' users purchased a card, it was immediately relisted on the marketplace for a higher price. The smart contracts carrying the cards would double in price with each transaction until they reach 0.05 ETH. And once they reached 0.05 ETH, they then increased by 25 percent.  In this way, Crypto All Stars played off the virality CryptoKitties, but it also added to it, allowing those on the actual cards to verify it was them via Twitter and then receive part of the proceeds.  The math was split like this: 92 percent of the profits for a sold card went to the owners of the card, 4 percent went to the verified star and another 4 percent went to the platform’s creators.  As such, crypto celebrities featured took to Twitter to pump their cards.  ""Move over CryptoKitties. We now have Crypto All Stars to clog the ethereum network!"" litecoin’s Charlie Lee wrote on Twitter.  Others called it ""toxic,"" stating that those involved were ""shilling for fame to their followers"" and likened its structure to a ""ponzi."" It seems Mexicantarget agreed with the latter.  The dispute  But cracks started to show even before the purchase, with the platform’s two founders publicly devolving into a state of in-fighting over the weekend.  In a blog post published on Sunday, co-founder ""Crypto Randy Marsh"" alleged that the project's creator, Adam Hadar, had gone AWOL and that he was also adding new cards without consent – something that could damage the economics of the gameplay.  As a result of the infighting, Crypto Randy Marsh wrote: ""Our co-founder and main developer Adam [Hadar] has locked me out of the project and is holding it hostage at the ransom of a buyout.""  In a screenshot posted on Twitter, Crypto Randy Marsh was also seen messaging users in an attempt to return funds. Responding on Twitter, Hadar said he was actively sending game users payouts.  ""I am first sending [people] payouts, then [will] post the code open source,"" the lead developer wrote.  Hadar continued:  ""I can’t believe you're doing this to me, I will post all screenshots, will post all the code open source and also continue clients all payouts as I always did and they are verifiable on the blockchain. You tried to scam me and now using your follow to destroy me.""  As Hadar alludes, he appears to have grown unhappy with Crypto Randy Marsh's involvement in the project, and with the organic nature of its leadership (Crypto Randy Marsh joined later to promote the project), feeling like it lessened his involvement in the game's success.  Later, Hadar tweeted that he had sent Marsh the remaining funds, writing ""he can do the payouts now actually. I stop being a slave for fame whores that than call me a scammer.""  The online dispute led some users to suspect the founders were trying to abscond with funds, while others scrambled to sell their cards in fear that the value could suddenly disappear.  The motives?  As for how to go forward after the controversy, takeaways remain difficult to parse.  ""Apparently the guy that bought Crypto All Stars has plans to shut everything down. What a fucking shitshow. I have been dealing with psychotics,"" Crypto Randy Marsh wrote as it became apparent that the purchased website would be taken offline.  The wider internet seems to largely agree.  Even Riccardo Spagni, the lead maintainer of the cryptocurrency monero (and an avid critic of ICOs who plays fast and loose with the term ""scam"") said he didn’t quite understand why the game was being demonized.  “I mean, people will always buy stupid stuff; white knighting it is just dumb,” he told CoinDesk.  But of biggest concern for many is whether money will be returned in some form.  Mexicantarget continues to state that 30 ether belonging to the founders is now in the hands of an escrow named Cyrus. Although according to screenshots of messages between the founders, it doesn't seem like who gets what will be easily decided on.  For users, however, it's still unclear whether they'll be left empty-handed, or what lessons are gained by the tale in its messy entirety.  Neeraj Agarwal, director of communications at the non-profit group Coin Center, remarked that his only thoughts were that it seems like a case of a good concept going to waste.  Agarwal concluded:  “I thought it was a fun idea. Too bad it didn't work out.”  Gaming image via Flickr",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LTC | MARKET | TRADING,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/02/20/game-over-crypto-vigilante-shuts-down-twitters-favorite-dapp,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/57bc4e8c17941f79d3cd998883fd250e044bba08-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42401119,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLlnv,1519138813,"Finland Mandates Cold Storage, Public Auctions for Seized Bitcoins","Finland's government released new guidelines on Tuesday that set out how law enforcement officials must handle cryptocurrencies they confiscate.  The official agencies in charge of storing the cryptocurrencies will now be prohibited from placing the funds on exchanges, and must instead keep them offline and inaccessible from the internet, a Bloomberg report states, citing official Treasury documents.  The ruling effectively means the agencies involved will need to identify some form of cold storage solution, in which they would maintain a wallet that does not have an active Web connection. Bloomberg said the Helsinki customs office would not indicate how it has been storing the cryptocurrencies until now.  The news source states that Finland's authorities currently hold around 2,000 BTC that have been confiscated in raids since 2016, as per data from the customs office. At today's prices, the 2,000 BTC is worth around $23 million, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  As reported by CoinDesk, in 2016, customs agents in Finland seized bitcoin and other items worth about €1 million at the time, in connection with the operation of an online dark market called Valhalla.  Asset treatment  The new guidelines go on to indicate that authorities must also treat cryptocurrencies as assets, rather than currencies.  Once a court has ruled that the funds will not be returned to the owner, Bloomberg says, they may be exchanged for euros. The document recommends sales should take place through public auctions, rather than on cryptocurrency exchanges, for security reasons.  Other governments have faced the quandary of what to do with cryptocurrencies they confiscate – and as seen in the U.S., the solution is often simply to auction them off publicly.  While it's not clear how they must store cryptocurrencies, U.S. authorities have held a number of auctions for seized bitcoins in recent years.  Most notable, perhaps, were the sales of cryptocurrency holdings seized from the now-defunct dark market Silk Road. One such sale held in mid-2014 offered 29,656 BTC (won by investor Tim Draper), and a later auction of 44,341 BTC took place in October 2015.  Combined, those 73,997 bitcoin would be worth $853 million at today's prices.

42401114,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLljz,1519135214,Vitalik Has a New Idea for ICOs – And It's Being Tested,"Investors need more control over ICOs  At least, that's according to ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin. One of the early thinkers to shape the crypto funding mechanism concept, he hasn't quite put the idea aside, last month proposing it could be combined with a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to best allow investors to have a say in how money raised gets handled.  Flash forward to today and what Buterin called a ""DAICO"" is already being developed, with gaming startup The Abyss building its own version for its upcoming token sale.  ""This idea found a free place in my heart,"" said Konstantin Boyko-Romanovsky, the project's founder. ""We really want to make something beautiful.""  As Boyko-Romanovsky alludes to, the ICO model has been called into question for enabling entrepreneurs to raise big money without a product or platform already built. (Even Boyko-Romanovsky has gotten burned by several ICOs, which is why he believes better tech could help ensure a token's team isn't interested in a cash grab.)  And by adopting the DAICO model first, he also wants to show investors that The Abyss is truly about disrupting platforms for selling video games (like Valve's market-leading site, Steam) by making the promotion of video games more flexible and delivering more money to developers.  Still, while the concept will get a test run with The Abyss project, others are skeptical it will be widely embraced.  First and foremost, like ICOs, the DAO concept has a rough history, since the first DAO had a vulnerability that allowed a ""attacker"" to transfer $60 million worth of ether to themselves. (The consequences and uneasiness of the fallout still reverberate throughout the community.)  Yet, former Monax legal counsel and ICO skeptic, Preston Byrne pointed to a deeper question: Do ICO investors really want to be bothered with governance?  ""Most DAO users are less interested in managing their chosen project than they are in offloading their coins at a massive profit on new entrants as quickly as possible,"" he wrote.  But Boyko-Romanovsky believes the industry has matured enough, with a significant number of sophisticated, institutional investors coming to the table, to want such insight into the inner-workings of an ICO issuer.  He told CoinDesk:  ""DAICO, this is true crypto for me, because it utilizes the best from ethereum.""  Minimum viable DAICO  So, just how exactly does the DAICO combine two of ethereum's more popular concepts?  In Buterin's post, he describes a smart contract in which token holders vote to set two mechanisms: a ""tap"" and a ""refund."" First, the tap is the rate at which the smart contract would allow the issuing team to draw down ether from the smart contract that holds funds raised in a crowdsale.  ""The intention is that the voters start off by giving the development team a reasonable and not-too-high monthly budget, and raise it over time as the team demonstrates its ability to competently execute with its existing budget,"" Buterin said in the post.  The refund then allows users to vote whether they should ""self-destruct"" the ICO, which simply empties out the smart contract of all remaining ether and returns it to the token holders in proportion to however many tokens they hold.  To Boyko-Romanovsky, it's a slick idea.  ""Most people don't understand what is DAICO and how it will change the industry,"" he said.  But one that was even more attractive since Buterin himself proposed it.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We got much, much more attention because of this.""  Upgrading Vitalik  But as much as Buterin's DAICO idea spoke to Boyko-Romanovsky, the developer is tweaking the mechanism a bit to make it more appropriate for The Abyss.  For instance, The Abyss DAICO will have another way to increase funds to the team, called a ""buffer."" The buffer is an option for a one-time payment, so if one month they have a major expense which the flow doesn't cover, they can propose a buffer vote to token holders.  On top of that, the project's tap is more limited than the one Buterin proposed.  For one, the flow can never be increased more than 50 percent month over month. So, if the tap is 100 ETH per month now, it can't go higher than 150 ETH per month during the next vote. On the vote after that, it couldn't go higher than 225 ETH per month, and so on.  Even then, the rate of raises could still happen quite fast, so The Abyss team inserted another limit. After each tap and buffer vote, no vote of the same type can happen again for two weeks.  The team also defined some rules about what it takes to establish a ""quorum"" – the number of people it takes to make a vote legitimate.  The number of voters in each vote has to equal no less than half the number of voters in the prior vote. So, if 100 people vote in the first poll, at least 50 people have to vote the next time to make a quorum. That said, if 200 people vote on that second poll instead, then at least 100 people would be needed to hold a legitimate vote the next time.  Token refunds?  Perhaps, though, the most radical change The Abyss team made was in what it takes to launch a refund vote.  The Abyss will seek three to five crypto luminaries to serve as ""oracles"" over their ICO, and a majority of those oracles must agree to a refund vote for it to be initiated. If the oracles vote for a refund poll, then the token holders get a chance to vote on it.  This change protects an honest developer running a DAICO from investors moving for a refund because a rapid increase in the price of ether makes them want to cash out ether now, instead of wait for ICO returns later.  Having added that stipulation, though, Boyko-Romanovsky said, ""I am not afraid that my project will be closed because of refund or something else.""  And the industry will soon see, as The Abyss's ICO starts next month, with a hard cap of $60 million in ether.  ""People are asking why we need $60 million, but we really need big money to compete with Steam,"" Boyko-Romanovksy said.  The project's KYC will be run from Switzerland, where the company is domiciled, although the team works from Russia. According to the company's website, in the U.S., only accredited investors can participate in the ICO, but everywhere else the crowdsale is open to anyone.  With the KYC and restrictions on investors, the project looks to be playing by the rules, something that aligns with Boyko-Romanovsky interest in being a trusted member of the crypto space.  According to him, just as the DAICO concept has attracted attention because of Buterin's support, potential investors trust people more than they understand the technology or underlying business models of platforms run with tokens.  And in that way, Boyko-Romanovsky concluded:  ""I want to become in this market: No matter what I do, what I do is very good. I think people will see in one year. I will get people's trust.""

At time of writing, the bitcoin global average was at $11,462.  Notably, valuations are higher over on data provider CoinMarketCap, where high prices in South Korea seem to be inflating the figures.

42401109,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLlh2,1519128606,"South Korea to Support 'Normal' Crypto Trading, Says Finance Watchdog","South Korea appears to be softening its stance on cryptocurrency trading.  According to Yonhap News, Choe Heung-sik, governor of the Financial Supervisory Service, has said the government ""will support [cryptocurrency trading] if normal transactions are made.""  At a meeting with representatives from cryptocurrency exchanges, Choe also said the government will ""encourage"" banks to work with cryptocurrency exchanges, the report states.  While brief, the statements will likely be seen positively by South Korea's crypto community, as well as world markets, since the option to outright ban cryptocurrency exchanges had been mulled by regulators as one way to calm the country's heated cryptocurrency market and counter money-laundering.  After the news broke that South Korea might ""ban or suppress"" cryptocurrency trading, prices of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin dropped sharply in mid January. Soon after, the country's finance minister moved to calm the markets stressing that regulating exchanges is the government's ""immediate task,"" though he did not rule out a future ban.  The statement also comes soon after the country has moved to restrict the market in other ways.  A ban on anonymous trading took effect on Jan. 30, after which cryptocurrency transactions must be conducted via accounts attached to users' identities. People flouting the ruling now face penalties if caught.  South Korea has since revealed that it is considering adopting a system similar to New York's ""BitLicense"" for the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges.  According to BusinessKorea, a government official involved with a virtual currency task force said Feb. 13: ""We are positively considering the adoption of an exchange approval system as the additional regulation on cryptocurrencies. We are most likely benchmark the model of the State of New York that gives a selective permission [for exchange operations].""

House bill 70 has now been passed to the senate for approval. If passed and signed by the state's governor, the bill would take effect on July 1, public documents show.  The legislation aims to exempt some utility token developers or sellers from securities regulations, provided they meet specific criteria.  These include that the token cannot be sold as an investment, but must be able to be traded for something, as previously reported by CoinDesk. In addition, the seller cannot have joined a repurchase agreement or an agreement to find a buyer for the token.  Furthermore, entities would be exempt from broker-dealer classifications if they were involved in token sales which meet the listed criteria. Banks, credit unions and savings and loan associations, among other parties, would not be covered by the bill, however.  The new legislation is not the only one that might be up for consideration by the senate. Another bill introduced last week would exempt cryptocurrencies from being taxed as property.

42401122,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLlqs,1519122005,Venezuela's 'Petro' Token Launches in Pre-Sale,"The Venezuelan government has officially launched the pre-sale of its controversial ""petro"" token, according to a report.  The petro was first announced in early December 2017 by President Nicolas Maduro as a way to circumvent U.S. sanctions, amid an economic crisis and a plunge in the value of the bolivar. The token is said to be backed by commodities, including oil, of which the country has notable reserves.  According to Latin American news source Telesur, 82.4 million tokens are available initially. The president has previously said that 100 million petros will be issued, valued at over $6 billion.  President Maduro was quoted as saying in a launch announcement:  ""Petro is born and we are going to have a total success for the welfare of Venezuela. ... The largest and most important companies and blockchain in the world are with Venezuela, we are going to sign agreements.""  A ""manual"" setting out how to acquire the petro will now be available in several languages, Telesur states.  The official in charge of managing the token, Carlos Vargas, reportedly said the pre-sale and initial offering will be exchangeable for ""hard currencies"" and cryptocurrencies, but not the comestic fiat currency, the bolivar.  While it might make sense for a cash-strapped country to try and bring in new funding via such a token sale, the petro has been controversial from the get-go.  Venezuela's opposition-run congress declared soon after it was announced that the petro would be illegal. The legislative body argued that the issuance would effectively be borrowing against the country's oil reserves, thus violating laws setting out that congress must approve government borrowing.  Saying the scheme was ""tailor-made for corruption,"" legislator Jorge Millan said, ""This is not a cryptocurrency, this is a forward sale of Venezuelan oil.""  In late January, U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R.-Fl) and Robert Menendez (D.-NJ) also denounced the planned cryptocurrency in an open letter addressed to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Rubio and Menendez wrote at the time: ""It is imperative that the U.S. Treasury Department is equipped with tools and enforcement mechanisms to combat the use of cryptocurrency to evade U.S. sanctions in general, and in this case in particular.""  According to CNBC, Harry Colvin, director and senior economist at Longview Economics, expressed doubts about the potential success of the petro scheme.  ""Venezuela has been known for misappropriation of assets in the past and the central bank has just created hyperinflation so I imagine there'll be trust and transparency issues,"" he told the news source.  Furthermore, should President Maduro lose the election in April, ""then petros would probably be made illegitimate,"" he added.

42401115,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLllx,1519117233,R3 Center to Train Next Generation of DLT Lawyers,"R3 is taking new steps to train the next generation of distributed ledger lawyers.  Announced February 20, the consortium of more than 200 financial institutions has assembled a team of 10 law firms to create the Legal Center of Excellence (LCoE), a platform for educating lawyers around the world on the fundamentals of blockchain technology and the ecosystem that's grown up around it.  Including law firms such as Crowell & Moring LLP (the legal counsel that helped R3 raise $107 million in venture capital), Baker McKenzie and Perkins Coie, the group has formed to accelerate the rate qualified crypto lawyers are created.  Members – also including Ashurst, Clifford Chance, Fasken, Holland & Knight, Shearman & Sterling, and Stroock – will not only collaborate on future projects but will also share what they learn via papers published periodically. The lawyers will receive a number of services, including access to R3's soon-to-be-launched Corda Enterprise platform.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Jason Rozovsky, R3's senior counsel and head of the new center, sought to portray the move as one that would lay the legal foundation for a wide range of enterprise applications.  He told CoinDesk:  ""These are some of the last pieces that we need to ensure that folks, including our membership, get comfortable with using the technology.""  Insider access  To accomplish those ends, the members will meet on a monthly basis and will review not only research papers that have not been made available to the public, but also demos of both public blockchain projects – and stealth projects – according to Rozovsky.  For instance, last week, members were given access to an early demo of Project Maison, a project co-built with RBS to explore using DLT in the regulatory reporting process. The pilot project, which is being done in partnership with the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, telecom giant BT and the Cyprus Securities & Exchange Commission, has already been deemed a success and is now in the process of moving to live data.  As part of that process, LCoE members were shown how the Corda-based service works, along with a demo of LEIA 2, a previously revealed identity platform co-built with R3 and the Synechron business consultancy.  In addition to all this, members will receive a monthly newsletter about one another's progress and ongoing access to R3's researchers.  According to Rozovsky:  ""The idea is to help these folks actually get a practical understanding of what's going on in the blockchain space, what are the projects that we're working on and what are the benefits we're seeing.""  R3, which is managing the facility out of its New York City offices, is not disclosing the fees to join the center, but a requirement for joining is that the law firm has to work in at least one jurisdiction where the consortium has members.  While work on helping the lawyers write actual smart contracts isn't in the immediate future for LCoE, Rozovsky said that could happen down the road as part of more specific working groups.  A new kind of competition  R3's work to help better educate lawyers in their field is also part of a broader initiative on multiple fronts.  First, R3's Corda Enterprise platform is expected to launch soon with a number of live applications already in the works, marking a major milestone in a year expected to be packed with version 1.0 launches by competitors, including blockchain consortium Hyperledger.  Second, and more specifically to the center, getting a group of lawyers together to collaborate is just the latest effort to mobilize global legal experts on industry issues. Last year, another group of 10 law firms, including some of the same members, joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, and helped launch its Legal Industry Working Group.  The lure of these groups, according to the head of Crowell & Moring's blockchain and DLT initiative, Jenny Cieplak, is that in addition to gaining access to the new technology, law firms gain access to support from each other.  She said:  ""The primary purpose of this is to share ideas and to get expertise and to come up with things that we just wouldn't have really come up with on our own.""

42401112,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLlj0,1519099503,New Bitcoin Code Will Finally Boast Full SegWit Support,"Segregated Witness (SegWit) is special.  And it's not just because the bitcoin code change is focused on scaling the network (it is), or that it paves the way for a new layer for the tech that's potentially faster and cheaper (it does).  Finally activated last August after months of controversy, SegWit is now spurring developers to put together a more structured, ""themed"" release for the software, an unusual development for the team behind the world's oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency network.  Most of the time when Bitcoin Core introduces new changes to the cryptocurrency's code, the loose group of volunteer developers simply combine disparate optimizations together. But this coming code release, 0.16.0, the sixteenth ""major release"" since bitcoin began, is a bit different.  Set to launch in the coming days, the updates all revolve around SegWit – with most focusing on making it easier to send SegWit-style transactions from the software's default wallet.  So, while the first software rollout of SegWit was about making sure the network understood the new rules, 0.16.0 is all about making it possible for users to take advantage of their benefits.  Bitcoin Core contributor Andrew Chow told CoinDesk:  ""The primary change is the addition of SegWit in the wallet. This lets users to easily create SegWit addresses.""  SegWit galore  Toward that goal, Chow explained that SegWit features have been added to both the command line set and the wallet user interface, so both programmers and non-programmers can use it.  Chaincode Lab engineer and Bitcoin Core contributor Marco Falke noted that while it was possible to create SegWit addresses in prior wallet versions, the process was ""rather hacky"" and ""mostly hidden.""  Now, though, with the software release, SegWit addresses will be the default, meaning that new addresses are automatically compatible with the scaling feature.  Version 0.16.0 is also the first release to support ""native SegWit addresses,"" also called bech32 addresses, a new address format pioneered by Bitcoin Core contributors Pieter Wuille and Greg Maxwell that's more user-friendly than older addresses types and supports SegWit automatically.  According to Falke, ""That is the most exciting part of the release.""  With SegWit addresses being created automatically, wallet users should soon experience lower fees. And progress there could have wider implications.  Bitcoin Core first introduced SegWit inNovember 2016, and the battle that followed prompted some software users to support acompeting cryptocurrency that did away with it altogether. (Called bitcoin cash, the network's supporters have long argued that bigger blocks, in which more space is allotted for transactions, is the key to lower fees.)  And according to Chow, one advantage of the native SegWit address format is that fees are a bit lower, although he acknowledged that because the format is so new, most wallets don't currently support it.  Chow said that other pieces of the release give users more flexibility over their Bitcoin Core wallet. For example, users can store their wallets, or private keys, in another data directory if they want to.  For the more tech-minded, check out the release noteshttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.16/doc/release-notes.md for more details.  Long time coming  Stepping back, the release could also help with SegWit's sometimes troubled messaging, as its adoption has been perhaps slower than anticipated by advocates.  Indeed, while updating the code of a global software program perhaps shouldn't necessarily be a fast process, users have complained because even some major companies have yet to adopt it.  With this backdrop of user anticipation and impatience in mind, many might be surprised that it's taken Bitcoin Core so long to add support in its wallet for the transaction type. But developers contend there are a couple reasons for the delay.  First, the team says it wanted to see how SegWit actually worked on the network for a bit before supporting it, in case there were security vulnerabilities or other concerns, said Chow. Second, politics were a distraction as well.  While the software release before this one, 0.15.1, was supposed to boost the wallet's support of SegWit, developers claim a planned alternative bitcoin software launch, scheduled for November 2016, is partly blame for delaying the focus and redirecting efforts.

42401123,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLlpt,1519095025,California Bill Would Legally Recognize Blockchain Data,"A California lawmaker has introduced a bill that, if passed, would update the state's electronic records laws to account for blockchain signatures and smart contracts.  Assembly Bill 2658  , submitted by Assemblymember Ian Calderon last week, expands the definition of electronic records and signatures – contained in the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act – to include records and signatures on the blockchain, notably stipulating:  ""A record that is secured through blockchain technology is an electronic record.""  The existing law ""specifies that a record or signature may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form and that a contract may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because an electronic record was used in its formation."" In essence, a signature on a blockchain would be legally enforceable should the bill advance through California's legislature and be signed by Governor Jerry Brown.  Likewise, the measure states that ""a signature that is secured through blockchain technology is an electronic signature"" and also updates the term ""contract"" to account for smart contracts, or self-executing pieces of code that trigger when certain conditions (like a reaching a particular block number on a blockchain) are met.  The bill also addresses data storage on the blockchain. It proposes that individuals who choose to use a blockchain to secure personal information in the course of carrying out interstate or foreign commerce should retain the rights of ownership to their information.  Calderon's bill is the latest measure of its kind to emerge from a state-level legislature in the U.S.  Representatives in Florida introduced similar legislation last month in the state's House, and lawmakers in Arizona passed a bill last year that provided blockchain data and smart contracts with legal status.  However, California's bill is particularly notable given that the state's economy is the largest in the U.S., with a Gross Domestic Product akin to that of France.
