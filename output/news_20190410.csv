42430375,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsBdh,1554937316,Coinbase Launches Crypto Visa Debit Card for UK and EU Customers,"Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has launched a Visa debit card allowing customers in the U.K. and EU to spend their cryptocurrencies directly from their Coinbase accounts.  The San Francisco-based firm announced the news in a blog post on Wednesday, saying that with the ""Coinbase Card,"" customers will be able to spend their bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC) and other cryptocurrencies “as effortlessly as the money in their bank.”  The exchange said it will “instantly” convert cryptocurrency to fiat currency, such as the British pound (GBP), when customers complete a transaction using the debit card.  The card supports all crypto assets available to buy and sell on the Coinbase platform, and customers can use them to pay for everyday purchases, such as a meal or booking tickets, according to the announcement.  With previously available products of this type, customers had to pre-load a specified amount of cryptocurrency onto the card in order to spend, Coinbase said.  The exchange has also launched an app for the card on both Android and iOS platforms, enabling customers to select which cryptocurrency wallet they will use to fund their spending. The app also offers “instant” receipts, transaction summaries and spending categories.  For the first 1,000 customers, Coinbase said it will waive the card issuance fee of £4.95 ($6.48).  PaySafe, a U.K. payment processor, is the issuer of the cards, a Coinbase spokesperson told CoinDesk.  In a similar development last month, banking startup 2gether said it was launching a prepaid Visa debit card that allows users to spend cryptocurrencies. With the 2gether card, customers will be able to pay with either euros or any of the following seven cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), EOS, Stellar (XLM) and litecoin (LTC).

42422913,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qzDh,1554933654,Christine Lagarde Pits Circle Against JPMorgan in IMF Debate,"A panel Wednesday featuring JPMorgan and Circle was set up by Christine Lagarde as a face-off between incumbent and disruptor.  The managing director of the International Monetary Fund designated roles for each person on her panel of four. In the incumbent corner: two regulators and JPMorgan. In the other: crypto fintech company Circle. The topic: ""Money and Payments in the Digital Age.""  ""They have each agreed to a particular game where they have been assigned a role that resembles what they do in life,"" Lagarde said.  Lagarde set the stage by pointing out that cash is diminishing, mobile is on the rise and person-to-person (P2P) payments have become a gigantic market, especially in China but with very strong showings in Kenya and Europe as well.  Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire  was quick to draw the thread between P2P and crypto.  Payment systems like WeChat and Alipay, he said, are simply a better user experience, but cryptocurrencies reflect an impulse that's endemic to the web.  ""I think it simply reflects the impulse that users of the internet have to connect directly and interact,"" he said.  Regulation first  Sarah Youngwood from JPMorgan's consumer and community banking division spoke for the bank. In her first comments, she said, ""I think it's very important: We love competition. Competition makes us better.""  The theme Youngwood returned to repeatedly was the need for regulation. ""We welcome the competition as long as the activities of the competitors get regulated, and it's solving customer issues,"" she said.  Youngwood highlighted JPMorgan's work creating a consortium of banks to offer an alternative to Venmo, called Zelle, which had $119 billion in payments in 2018. She also spoke of JPM Coin as a consortium project.  It's worth noting here that Lagarde also asked the panel to agree that they weren't there to discuss bitcoin. For his part, Allaire preferred to emphasize the possibilities of putting a sovereign currency on a public blockchain infrastructure.  ""The classic centralized clearing and settlement systems,"" he said, ""we think will go the way those things have gone in the way of media and retail.""  Allaire said that if sovereign money went onto the internet in a way where people didn't need a third party to hold their assets safely and they could trade with anyone on the planet quickly, then ""they wouldn't want to go back.""  Once that happens, he said, everyone will want to use the most stable currencies, which will mean reserve currencies. That, he predicted, will threaten governments that don't have reserve-status money.  He pointed out that people already trust public infrastructure for sharing information, in the form of messaging and the internet. ""An open internet model I think will ultimately be felt by the end users as a superior model,"" Allaire said.  In math we trust?  ""Banks are technology companies,"" Youngwood argued, but they are companies that have a track record of providing transparency and security that customers expect.  Allaire argued the same trustworthiness can be provided with cryptography, and once people can trust math everything that needs to be verified can be checked by anyone with access to the internet.  He took this a step further and argued that the threat model for open-ledger networks is nation-state-level adversaries. That's a much higher level of security than most banks can claim, he argued.  This argument didn't quite seem to land with his fellow panelists, however.  Lagarde expressed doubt that consumers would want to check the math. And Youngwood moved in on the most famous cryptocurrency of all.  ""There has been more fraud in bitcoins than virtually any other form of payment that has existed,"" she said.  Allaire didn't argue that point.  ""Bearer instruments are really attractive to people who want to steal things,"" he said. But Allaire didn't want to overemphasize payments. ""Payments is actually the sideshow. Payments is going to disappear,"" he predicted. He was more interested in the automation and integration enabled by digitizing and decentralizing.  But it was the European regulator, however, who raised perhaps the most haunting concern about the future that Allaire was painting.  Benoît Cœuré of the European Central Bank's executive board said he was concerned about ""the fragility decentralization can introduce in the system if not properly managed.""  Cœuré asked the audience to think back to 2007, which is ironic since many cryptocurrency advocates point to the same time period as the industry's impetus. Cœuré saw it differently.  ""We come from a crisis that was created by risks being thinly spread across the system,"" he said, saying that regulators were then told that spreading out risks as they had made the overall system more resilient. However, he told the crowd:  ""It proved not to be.""

42430381,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsBnh,1554922854,"A Freelance Job Market Is Moving Its 700,000 Users to EOS","Over 700,000 user accounts from a freelancing website are moving onto the EOS blockchain.  Moonlighting, a marketplace for freelance professionals launched in 2014, has taken on a $5 million investment round led by the FinLab EOS VC fund, a joint venture of FinLab AG and Block.one. The investment will be used to grow Moonlighting's user base and to integrate its existing infrastructure with EOS.  ""We have been exploring blockchain protocols since the end of 2017 and [have] chosen EOSIO due to its ability to scale transaction processing, maintain low transaction costs and enable ease of user account management,"" Moonlighting CEO Jeff Tennery told CoinDesk.  Stepping back, Block.one raised an estimated $4 billion in a yearlong initial coin offering that ended in 2018, using those funds to develop the EOSIO software on which the EOS blockchain is run. Block.one also invested in funders who would support applications meant to run on the new blockchain, most famously in Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital. The FinLab EOS VC fund is a similar effort.  “We believe that Moonlighting contains the three key traits you look for in a decentralized application: real customers, real traction and a bona fide use case for blockchain technology,"" Paul Grotowski, COO of EOS VC, said in a press release.  Germany's FinLab AG has been investing in financial technology since 2005. FinLab board member Stefan Schuetze said in a release that people at his firm ""believe they will be one of the early winners to validate blockchain.”  Blockchain freelancers  Integrating with Web 3.0 technology is a strategic shift for Moonlighting.  ""We decided that we want our users to be able to port their profile to any platform and provide them a simple way to use their Moonlighting profile wherever they chose to use it,"" Tennery said via email. ""The gig economy is so fragmented, and our plan is to let freelancers control the use of their profile and provide a single sign-on, aggregated gateway.""  Critically, however, the company is not copying all of its data to the blockchain in plain text. Instead, it's securing the data using hashes that still rely on Moonlighting's centralized database to decrypt.  ""The hashes on the blockchain provides audit-ability and validity to our freelancer profiles maintained off-chain,"" he said.  This is important because the company plans to use this funding to increase its validation of profiles, for example by authenticating freelancers' various training certifications.  Said Tennery:  ""This funding facilitates implementing our blockchain plans to be the Oracle of Profiles in the freelance economy.""  It's not Moonlighting's first foray into crypto. The company considered, but never conducted, an initial coin offering in mid-2018 to help facilitate faster payments. ""Too much scrutiny last year,"" Tennery told CoinDesk.

42430364,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsBFh,1554916615,New York Rejects Bittrex Exchange's BitLicense Application,"The New York Department of Financial Services rejected Seattle-based crypto exchange Bittrex's application for a BitLicense Wednesday.  In a letter published by NYDFS, the NY regulator explains that a number of factors contributed to the rejection, the first such action in two years.  ""Throughout Bittrex's application process, the Department worked steadily with Bittrex to address continued deficiencies and to assist Bittrex in developing appropriate controls and compliance programs commensurate with the evolving nature of the sector,"" wrote Daniel Sangeap, deputy superintendent and deputy counsel at NYDFS.  The regulator ""issued several deficiency letters"" since the exchange first submitted an application, addressing Bittrex's anti-money laundering procedures, Office of Foreign Assets Control compliance and its coin listing process.  However, a number of concerns remained unaddressed, Sangeap wrote.  The letter goes into detail, saying that ""Bittrex's current policies and procedures are either non-existent or inadequate,"" questioning the ""level of authority and effectiveness of the Compliance Officer,"" saying it may have an inadequate training program for employees and raising a number of other issues.  Bittrex's chief compliance officer is John Roth, a former Department of Homeland Security Inspector General who's also spent time at the Department of Justice (as a special counsel for international money laundering policy) and was a member of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the U.S. (more commonly known as the 9-11 Commission).  Bittrex CEO Bill Shihara told CoinDesk that Roth developed the exchange's compliance program.  Disputed claims  In a statement  , Bittrex disputed the regulator's findings and said it has already begun addressing many of these concerns. (Read the full statement below).  Sangeap's letter pointed to Bittrex's OFAC screening process, saying it may not be able to identify misspelled names, that its monitoring process is manual rather than automated and that the exchange's ""active customer file"" indicated that Bittrex processed ""several transactions involving customers from OFAC sanctioned countries.""  Compliance chief Roth told CoinDesk that while some residents of Iran were able to trade on the exchange in 2017 due to ""an unintentional gap"" in its compliance procedures, these accounts were suspended in October of that year.  ""We disabled the accounts ... and immediately reported, then reported it in more detail in January 2018,"" he said. ""No one from an OFAC sanctioned country has traded since October 2017.""  Customer due diligence was another highlighted issue.  According to NYDFS, some of the accounts at Bittrex are identified by ""clearly false names"" such as ""Elvis Presley,"" ""Donald Duck,"" ""Give me my money"" and ""abc-abc,"" as well as ""obscene terms and phrases"" (no examples were provided).  In its statement, Bittrex said NYDFS' sample came from 2017, but that the exchange has implemented more stringent customer identification processes since, going so far as to disable any accounts which do not meet its ""enhanced verification standard.""  Roth elaborated, saying that ""none of the accounts [with bogus names] were active accounts,"" adding:  ""They couldn’t trade, they couldn’t withdraw money, they couldn’t engage in any economic activity because they weren’t enhanced verified ... That doesn't get mentioned in the letter anywhere, that those folks never traded.""  Coin diligence  One section of the letter, titled ""lack of adequate due diligence in launching tokens or products,"" states that examiners from NYDFS were ""unable to assess compliance"" with the exchange's own token review policy when looking at a random sample of 15 cryptocurrencies.  ""This was due to the fact that partial files were provided to the examiners, and moreover, actual compliance in certain files could not be established,"" Sangeap said. Some tokens were listed despite some applicants refusing to complete the necessary paperwork – ""and in one case ... there was no application on file at all.""  The exchange offers more than 200 cryptocurrencies to its customers, including through an OTC trading desk launched earlier this year.  In its statement Wednesday, Bittrex said NYDFS presented a supervisory agreement to the exchange which would have allowed it to offer only 10 cryptocurrencies.  According to Roth, this list included bitcoin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin cash SV, litecoin, ether, ethereum classic, Stellar lumens, cardano, XRP and dogecoin.  ""This would have prohibited Bittrex from listing coins that are offered to New York residents by other BitLicensees,"" the statement said. ""NYDFS reserved the right to order us to withdraw coins at any time. Additionally, DFS would be able to prohibit offering tokens to NY residents, even if other NY BitLicense holders were able to offer the tokens.""  Shihara elaborated, saying that NYDFS ""also wanted the right to control what tokens we trade with any of our U.S. customers,"" meaning the 49 non-NY states and the District of Columbia.  These terms were unacceptable to Bittrex, the company said, and it refused to sign the agreement.  Leaving NY  Bittrex has 14 days to confirm to NYDFS that the exchange has ceased conducting business in New York and create a plan to wind down any existing business with state residents, according to Sangeap's letter.  The exchange will have 60 days in total to transfer any assets it custodies for New York residents and transfer any positions or transactions.  An NYDFS spokesperson told CoinDesk that there is no appeals process for the rejection, though Bittrex can reapply for a BitLicense.  Shihara told CoinDesk that the exchange was not making any profits in New York due to its high compliance costs, but the exchange operated in the state anyway ""because we really felt strongly that the taxes that we paid for operating our business in the U.S. are worth it.""  ""[It's] difficult to say if we'll reapply for the BitLicense,"" he added, but if NYDFS updates its regulatory framework to match how quickly the technology changes, he hopes to bring Bittrex back to the state.  In the meantime, Roth noted, Bittrex will develop internal controls to prevent any NY residents from using the exchange.  ""We don't know what those are yet but we'll have to do something,"" he said.

42430372,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsBVh,1554914738,Tensions Flare in MakerDAO Community Call Over Transparency Issues,"Who runs the MakerDAO Foundation?  Questions over an ongoing board shakeup flamed tensions Tuesday during a weekly community call, with participants asking pointed questions about who controls a $190 million pot of MakerDAO governance tokens.  Stepping back, the MakerDAO Ecosystem Growth Foundation, or MakerDAO Foundation for short, is a non-profit entity that launched the dollar-pegged stablecoin DAI back in December 2017 along with a programmatic loan system to keep the value of DAI stable.  As stated in a recent blog post, the foundation “is tasked with bootstrapping the system to ensure that it can survive as a fully decentralized organization.” There are nine board members who oversee development funds for the network, which account for roughly 27 percent of all MakerDAO governance tokens in existence.  The identities of those nine board members have never been disclosed.  In another blog post, the foundation announced Monday that its board would be reconstituted to not only include “technical members” but “a decentralized community of stakeholders.”  ""We think it would be better to have more industry professionals with deeper business experience sitting on the board,"" MakerDAO Foundation general counsel Brian Avello told CoinDesk.  During yesterday's community call, Avello faced some tough questions about the nature of the foundation's organizational structure – the most pointed of which came from a former legal advisor to the MakerDAO Foundation itself, Chris Padovano.  Padovano asked when the bylaws of the foundation would be publicized, whether correspondence from board members could be released and if the foundation's proprietary trading desk is a for-profit initiative.  No concrete answers were given by Avello. When pressed specifically about board member correspondence, Avello responded to Padovano curtly (and in the third person):  ""Chris, this isn't Brian's deposition here where you're given the opportunity to try to paint me into some sort of corner. I'm telling you my answer is I can't discuss those matters.""  When asked about why there was a need to remove certain individuals from the board, Avello admitted he was not at liberty to discuss such matters on a public call. To this, MakerDAO Foundation head of communications Mike Porcaro told CoinDesk after the call that the lack of full transparency here was ""pretty traditional for most organizations"" and that ""in many cases, there are requirements based on employment law about what you can and cannot discuss.""  On the matter of board member identities, Avello did explain during the call that the specific reasoning for not disclosing information was for security reasons. Publicizing the identities of people who sign off on transactions from the multi-signatory developer fund would be a “security risk,” Avello said.  'Tensions are high'  ""Guys, I really do have to do a lot of work today [but] I'm more than happy to come back,"" said Avello when asked by call participants if he could stay on to answer further questions about the foundation's board and its finances.  Avello added:  ""I'm trying to give everyone as much as we possibly can the satisfaction that we're being as transparent as we possibly can.""  MakerDAO Foundation core community lead David Utrobin agreed it would be best to continue the Q&A session during next week's meeting.  The heated discussion comes as MakerDAO stakeholders face another decision to increase DAI's ""stability fee.""  Expected to end sometime on Thursday, a 4 percent increase to fees currently looks to be the most popular among MakerDAO governance token holders – with over 50,000 MakerDAO governance tokens currently staked in favor.  Having upped fees a total of four times in the past three months, head of community development Richard Brown said during Tuesday's call that he was ""reasonably sure"" such increases would continue until the DAI-to-U.S. dollar peg returns to parity.  ""It feels like the idea now is that every single week on Monday a poll goes out with a default range [to increase the stability fee] and then we collect the community sentiment and then we have an executive [vote] on Friday,"" said Brown.  Brown added:  ""Tensions are high and this is an important subject. Arguably, from my opinion, it's literally the most important thing we do at MakerDAO is the stability of the peg. Everything else flows from that.""  The final results of this week's community vote will be discussed during a scientific governance and risk meeting on Thursday. Members of the MakerDAO risk team are expected to also share during this meeting a detailed analysis of current DAI-to-USD trends.

42430368,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsBPh,1554908412,Bain Capital and Ripple's Xpring Invest in DeFi Founder's 'Scout Fund',"Robert Leshner, founder of crypto money market Compound Finance, has received $1 million from Bain Capital Ventures and Ripple's Xpring to write checks to early-stage companies.  The project is called Robot Ventures, both a play on Leshner's first name and a reminder that automation is coming for all work.    ""I think the robots will take our banking jobs as well,"" Leshner told CoinDesk.    A scout fund is a fairly recent development in the broader technology world, and Leshner doesn't know of another one looking specifically for crypto projects. That said, scout funds are known to operate somewhat secretively, so there's no way to be sure.  Distinct from angel investors in that they have a direct link to institutional money, scout funds normally eye toward investing in later rounds. An investment by such a group increases a new founder's access to the fund's funders (in this case, Xpring and Bain, which is one of the world's largest investment firms with over $105 billion in assets under management).  ""In general, the check size is $25,000 to $100,000. These are not large investments,"" Leshner said, but part of the deal is that he's communicating with the two institutional backers about his picks.  Robot has made two investments since taking on backing from Bain and Xpring – one into home-mining startup Coinmine and the other in Point, a new kind of debit card.  As a founder, Leshner argued he brings two advantages to running Robot. First, he sees the new trends in crypto finance first, from the grassroots level. ""We see innovations happening in DeFi very early,"" he said.  Second, it makes him uniquely relatable to young founders. ""What gives me a different approach is that 95 percent of my time is spent building Compound,"" he told us, ""and I can interact with other founders really as a peer, just one or two years ahead of them.""  Bain was previously an investor in Compound Finance and that relationship led directly to its backing of Robot (prior to the investment, Leshner operated Robot as a more traditional angel fund).  ""We enjoyed working with him and brainstorming about the sector so much that we set him up on AngelList as a small fund manager and put him in business by becoming the anchor investor in his small fund,"" Bain Capital Ventures partner Salil Deshpande told CoinDesk.  Meanwhile, Ripple (by way of Xpring) is a new backer for Leshner's work. ""I'm an open finance maximalist,"" Leshner said.  ""Robot Ventures is unique, given Robert is a DeFi founder himself,"" said Ethan Beard, SVP of Xpring. ""He's a valuable resource for new founders seeking to make an impact on and improve financial services through crypto. We're excited to work with Robert and support the next generation of entrepreneurs.""  As an angel investor, Leshner had previously backed a startup based on Ripple's Interledger banking protocol and he said he looks forward to doing more in that space.  For those and other crypto projects, the hope is that Leshner's direct connection to Xpring and Bain makes getting that first big round all the easier.  Said Leshner:  ""It just tees up those relationships much more quickly.""

42430380,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsBjh,1554901265,South Korea's Military Acquisitions Agency Plans Blockchain Pilot,"The South Korean agency charged with military acquisitions has launched a blockchain pilot project aimed to improve business operations in the defense sector.  The Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) announced Wednesday that the effort would involve building a blockchain platform to, among other benefits, prevent “illegal alteration” of defense business data.  Working with DAPA on the initiative are Korea’s Agency for Defense Development and Defense Agency for Technology and Quality. Together, the three agencies hope to improve the “credibility” of defense procurement operations by recording the acquisitions process, from initial bids to final evaluation, on the blockchain.  In addition, management of business proposal submission would be automated, eliminating the ""inconvenience"" of the traditional paper document process.  The blockchain system would also have potential roles outside acquisition, helping “reduce the burden” on defense companies by allowing unified management of firearms transportation permits and notifications, DAPA said.  Kim Tae-gon, senior planning and coordination officer at DAPA, said that the project is part of the agency’s plan to deploy blockchain within defense business systems and provide innovative public services.  Various South Korean government agencies have been trialing blockchain in the public sector over the last year.  Last September, the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA), a sub-organization of the Ministry of ICT, said it would double the number of blockchain pilot projects in the public sector from six last year to 12 this year. The agency said at the time that it would boost the blockchain pilot budget for 2019 to more than $9 million, in addition to the previously set funding of $9 million for both 2018 and 2019.  The country’s Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning and Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries have also launched a blockchain pilot aimed to bring new efficiencies to the container shipping industry.

In guidance published Monday, the FSC said that security tokens are classed as securities as defined in the country’s Securities Act 2005, but in digital form.  Issuers raising funds through STOs are therefore required to get prior approval from the FSC, according to the guidance. However, if the issue is targeting ""sophisticated"" or “expert” investors and funds, or professional investment schemes, prior approval is not required.  Further, anyone soliciting others to transact in security tokens is also required to gain a license under the Securities Act and ""strictly"" comply with relevant rules. To not do so would be considered a criminal offence, the document states.  Those rules include conduct appropriate due diligence of the STO project, its team and the ""rights and obligations"" regarding the assets backing the tokens. STO projects must also make disclosures, informing clients in an “accurate, timely and transparent” manner of the risks involved.  In an additional note, the FSC further cautioned that STOs carry a “high-risk,” and that investors are not protected by any statutory compensation arrangements in the Indian Ocean island nation.  The guidance on STOs is the watchdog's second in a series of notes for fintech firms. Last September, the watchdog published its first guidance on digital assets, recognizing them as an asset-class for “sophisticated and expert” investors.  Earlier this year, the FSC also issued final rules for digital asset custodians, mandating that they become licensed in order to carry out custody services, among other requirements.

42402790,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcrNx,1554892218,"This Bitcoin Price Pattern Suggests $5,800 Potential Ahead","View  Bitcoin has cemented a higher low and retained its bullish market structure on the daily chart after a hotly contested close on April 9.  The hourly chart shows bitcoin is trending inside an ascending triangle (typically bullish by nature) with a potential measured move to $5,885.  An exaggerated bullish divergence has formed on the hourly chart, providing additional weight to the likelihood of an imminent bullish breakout.  Bitcoin has managed to fend off any further attacks from the bears during April 9's tug-of-war trading session.  The cryptocurrency is now trading in a $100 range between $5,187 and $5,287 placing its price firmly above the prior April 4 low and cementing a higher low on the daily chart.  The hourly chart is also looking more favorable on the new daily trading period (April 10), with bullish momentum having maintained a hold above $5,200 support over the last 24-hours despite multiple dips in its price.  Bitcoin now looks set to continue its climb within the previously discussed ascending triangle – typically bullish indicators – with a measured target set at $5,885 should BTC break above the upper trendline at $5,320–$5,350.  Hourly chart        So how do we arrive at the $5,885 target? We can roughly calculate the potential move by measuring the height between A and B (the upper resistance line and the lowest drawdown in price within the pattern). That figure is then added to the upper resistance line above point C at the point of breakout, producing a new figure as a price target.  As can be seen, an exaggerated bullish divergence has also taken shape on the RSI, recorded from April 8–April 9, meaning a continuation in price is being supported additionally by the indicator on the hourly chart.  Daily chart  The daily chart shows the bulls maintained a higher low above April 4's red candle. That kept intact the bullish market structure above the key 100-period and 200-period moving averages yesterday, which are slowly beginning to converge for a bull cross.  Should those two lines cross bullish, then greater buying pressure would become the norm with a new bull run on the cards.  The RSI shows a divergence from price, printing lower lows while price continues to print higher lows, signaling greater bullish conditions ahead for the world's top crypto by market value.

42402777,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcrAB,1554886807,Top YouTuber PewDiePie Joins Blockchain Live Streaming Platform,"PewDiePie, the world’s most popular YouTuber by subscriber numbers, has joined blockchain-based live streaming platform DLive.  The 29-year-old Swedish content creator, real name Felix Kjellberg, has signed an “exclusive” live streaming deal with the platform, DLive announced Tuesday. His YouTube channel has 93.7 million subscribers at press time, with his most recent video racking up 4 million views in less than 24 hours.  Starting April 14, PewDiePie will stream weekly on DLive, a decentralized community built using the Lino blockchain, according to the announcement. On his official DLive channel, PewDiePie also said that he will support content creators on the platform by donating up to $50,000 to a maximum of 100 creators.  According to online sources, the YouTube star is the platform's ninth biggest earner, taking $15.5 million in 2018. A seven-year-old toy reviewer called Ryan tops the list with $22 million in earnings.  DLive rewards both content creators and viewers using its native token, ""Lino points."" While some platforms take up to 50 percent of creators' income, decreasing the “viability and livelihood” of the community, DLive takes no percentage of earnings and does not charge any fees to content creators, the platform said.  Lino Network co-founder Wilson Wei commented:  ""DLive is a place where instead of competing against each other, it benefits creators to support one another. With no platform cuts, we incentivize everyone to create the highest quality content for viewers.”  Lino raised $20 million in February 2018 to build a “YouTube on the blockchain” in a private token sale led by ZhenFund.  Wei claimed at the time that he expects content creators to garner three-to-five times the profits they make on YouTube or its competitor, Amazon-owned live streaming video platform Twitch.  PewDiePie said in today's announcement:  ""I'm excited to start live streaming again regularly!

42402783,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcrJ2,1554883251,$60 Million and Rising: China's Crypto Funds Try Lending to Beat Bear Market,"The Takeaway:  Crypto investment firms in China have turned to lending for a steady revenue stream to get through the bear market, including Bixin Capital, FBG Capital and Dong Zhao’s DGroup.  Each of these firms currently holds about $15 million worth of outstanding loans originated over the last five months.  Although most of these lenders don’t directly deal with Chinese yuan, they see borrowing demand domestically from retail investors, trading desks and cryptocurrency miners.      Several cryptocurrency investment firms and funds in China have turned to lending for a steady revenue stream to get through the bear market.  These new crypto lenders include such notable names as Bixin Capital, FBG Capital and DGroup, founded by Dong Zhao, who made a name by operating one of the longest-running over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks in China. Along with a startup called Babelbank, these investors have originated a combined $60 million worth of loans over the last five months, denominated in cryptocurrencies or, in one firm’s case, Chinese yuan.  The demand, they say, comes mostly domestically, from retail investors, hedge fund traders, and perhaps most unexpectedly, cryptocurrency miners.  ""The demand for personal crypto loans doesn’t fluctuate that much regardless of market conditions,"" said Xi Wang, head of financial markets at Bixin Capital. ""So, in a bearish market, making profits from lending assets is relatively a much [more] stable bet.""  Bixin Capital launched its crypto lending business in November 2018 since activities on the investment side had slowed down, letting customers borrow bitcoin (BTC), ether, EOS, litecoin and tether (USDT) from its own reserve.  For the loans, the firm requires borrowers to put up one of the five supported assets as collateral, and charges an annualized interest rate of about seven percent.  Currently, it has an outstanding loan volume of around $10 million worth of the U.S dollar-pegged USDT, on which it is earning steady interest of ""several BTC"" per month, Wang said.  Similarly, Vincent Zhou, founder of FBG Capital, also said while his firm has long been involved in crypto loans, it didn’t formally launch a lending unit mid-2018, and now has about $15 million worth of cryptocurrencies as loan receivables.  Bixin, which started as a wallet and mining pool service in 2014, established Bixin Capital in 2017 to invest in cryptocurrency projects entirely with its own capital, without limited partners.  As such, lending is a different kind of investment than Bixin is used to, Wang acknowledged, telling CoinDesk:  ""In a way, you can say it’s like a role shift, from investment banking and private equity to commercial banking.""  However, in one respect, this is much unlike bank lending.  Collateral, collateral, collateral  What makes crypto lending different from conventional bank loans is that the only risk control is strict enforcement of collateral requirements and forced liquidation, both Zhou and Wang said.  Wang added:  ""It’s a must. Conventional bank loans are based on your education, credit scores, jobs, properties, etc. We don’t evaluate any of these. That’s why our risk control must be completely on collateral.""  For instance, he explained, for Bixin, depending on what crypto serves as collateral, the collateral rate could range between 70 to 75 percent. So if a customer can put up $100 worth of BTC as collateral, they can borrow about $70 worth in USDT.  In the case above, if the price of the BTC decreases to around $78, causing the collateral rate to go above the threshold of 95 percent, borrowers must either put in additional BTC to lower the rate, or Bixin will force-liquidate the held bitcoin at the current price.  Both Wang and Zhou said while their firms essentially play the role of a crypto bank, they are staying away from dealing with Chinese yuan.  Zhou told CoinDesk:  ""There are lots of issues with lending Chinese yuan. One is that when we collect debts in fiat currency, it’s difficult for us to ensure that money is clean.""  Wang echoed that sentiment, adding that when Chinese yuan is involved in this context, it could lead to inquiries from law enforcement and could result in bank accounts being suspended.  But this vacuum presented an opportunity for Dong Zhao’s DGroup, which is operating its own crypto lending platform called RenRenbit.  Rather than acting as a lender itself, the firm serves as a consumer-to-consumer advertising platform to allow customers to borrow either Chinese yuan or crypto assets from third-party investors on the platform, with other types of assets held by RenRenbit as collateral.  Wei Wang, chief technology officer at RenRenbit, said in an interview that four months after the platform went live in November, it has facilitated $15 million to $20 million of loans, 60 percent of which are currently outstanding. And notably, that loan volume came from the pockets of just around 200 investors on its platform.  He added that prospective borrowers have the option to set a limit of the annualized interest that they will be charged, usually from 8 percent to 12 percent, and investors decide whether they want to lend the money.  Similarly, RenRenbit enforces a collateral rate that ranges from 65 percent to 85 percent, depending on what assets are pledged as collateral. The rate can be higher if the collateral is a more stable asset such as USDT, than say, bitcoin, Wang added.  And the company makes money by charging a 20 percent commission out of the profits or interest investors collect on each loan, he said. It has also rolled out automatic crypto investment plans to attract more newbies, through which investors deposit Chinese yuan regularly to the platform, which is then converted to various crypto assets based on different portfolio strategies.  Who’s borrowing?  Stepping back, cryptocurrency lending appears to be gaining traction outside China as well.  For instance, Galaxy Digital, the cryptocurrency fund backed by billionaire investor Michael Novogratz, is aiming to raise a fund of $250 million for lending.  BlockFi, a crypto lender backed by Galaxy Digital, also claimed it gathered $25 million of bitcoin and ether deposits from investors in two weeks, promising an annualized six percent interest. It’s lending out those assets and charges institutional borrowers annual interest of 4.5 percent.  It’s easy to see why lending – along with staking of cryptocurrencies such as Tezos – is appealing right now, since these activities generate a return at a time when crypto prices have been in a slump (this week’s rally notwithstanding). But who is borrowing these assets, and why?  Bixin’s Wang said while the firm doesn't require borrowers to disclose how they intend to use the loans (since its risk control solely relies on collateral), a significant portion of the demand comes from cryptocurrency miners in China who’d rather borrow USDT and liquidate that into Chinese yuan via OTC desks to pay for their electricity bills.  He explained:  ""In a bearish market, miners are reluctant to liquidate their mining results when the price of bitcoin is at the lower end. When you’ve seen bitcoin was once traded at $20,000, you’d feel that’s a huge opportunity cost.""  Indeed, Beijing-based Babelbank, which started off as a crypto bank startup last September, said over 90 percent of its current $27 million outstanding loans are made to cryptocurrency miners in China, who are gearing up their capacity ahead of the water-abundant summer in the country.  Del Wang, co-founder of BabelBank, which raised $2 million in seed and angel rounds from ZhenFund, Lightspeed Partners and NEO Capital, told CoinDesk:  ""As long as the ratio of electricity costs over mining results is lower than our collateral rate, a miner may never need to sell any bitcoin to pay utility bills – they borrow. And when a loan’s term matures, they just borrow another loan (to pay for previous loans).""  For miner borrowers, that’s simply a bet, hoping that bitcoin’s price will be higher in the coming months, reaching a point at which they are willing to sell.  The price for having that optionality of not paying mining costs out of their own pockets is they need to pay an annualized 8 percent to 12 percent in interest.  And aside from crypto miners, Bixin’s Wang said OTC and hedge fund traders in China are also strong forces in borrowing bitcoin, with USDT as collateral, so that they can build up basic trading positions without owning a more volatile asset.  ""More interestingly, some are even borrowing USDT with bitcoin as collateral and then invest in China’s stock markets,"" Wang said.  The SSE Composite Index, which is a market index of all stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, has notably increased by nearly 30% this year.  This may present a dilemma of sorts for investors. Referring to the rally in yuan-denominated stocks, known in China as A-shares, Wang concluded:  ""They certainly didn't want to miss out on the opportunities in A-shares. But then, what if bitcoin can even outperform the stock markets?""

42402786,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcrI3,1554868824,The Unbelievable Brilliance of Binance,"Pete Rizzo is editor in chief for CoinDesk.      Whatever people make of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its leader, Changpeng Zhao, the company's success isn't just unprecedented, it's precedent-setting.  Binance, I would argue, is emerging as the case study for growing a cryptocurrency business, a success that’s much needed in a community that spends too much time talking up the potential of its technology and too little time analyzing viable go-to-market strategies that can drive the technological sea change we foresee.  In that regard, I think the market is only just beginning to understand just how visionary Binance is and what its success – in terms of market timing and product impact – says about something we all are striving to find: a model for building scalable and impactful cryptocurrency businesses.  Indeed, at a time when many cryptocurrency startups are going through pivots and layoffs, Binance feels as if it's hitting its stride, offering a deeper level of new, innovative products that are moving the industry forward in just the right ways at just the right times.  It's a feat made more complex by the boom-bust nature of the cryptocurrency market, in which opportunities for user growth come and go quick and wherein the great majority of cryptocurrency startups overthink execution and fail to adapt thereafter.  But after observing Binance for over a year now, it's clear there's no business that has been as deliberate in taking advantage of the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market and its ebbs and flows.  Binance has only been around since 2017, but it has evolved significantly in its short life, in ways that show the impeccable thinking of its company and leadership.  Over the past 12 months, Binance has expertly shifted through three stages:  It delivered tested technology – a working crypto-to-crypto exchange offering buying and selling services in all but 15 countries – at a time when market conditions made it possible to massively capture users.  As the market downturn began, and other exchanges lost momentum, it shifted to incentivizing users to adopt value-adding products, such as Binance LaunchPad, which propels the sale of new cryptocurrencies directly through its exchange.  Now, with its investments in its forthcoming decentralized exchange, it may well be poised to disrupt itself in ways that further legitimize the cryptocurrency industry.  Buckets Of Rain  Focusing on this last idea, it's safe to say now that in the world of cryptocurrencies, there are two seasons: drought and monsoon.  I like this analogy because it implies its logic viscerally. There are times when acquiring new users (rain) is relatively easy (and when spending capital to acquire new, novice users is advantageous), and there are times (drought) when doing so is fruitless (when the costs of acquiring those users are prohibitively high).  In the case of Binance, its launch time – in the middle of the summer 2017 boom – couldn't have been better. As the rising tide would lift all boats, it perhaps obfuscated what actually occurred.  A seasoned industry veteran – CZ cut his teeth working at Blockchain and OKCoin, two early cryptocurrency success stories that later succumbed to fatigue – read the tea leaves, and executed a deft go-to-market strategy. Because CZ had spent years building trading systems (in crypto and externally), he was able to raise money via an ICO and deploy a battle-tested technology into an environment hungry for alternative assets (at a time when most exchanges were constrained by U.S.-dollar trading and the regulation in brought).  Here CZ made two decisions whose brilliance is only now becoming apparent.  One, he chose not to allow trading in fiat currencies, thus sidestepping the regulatory issues inherent with government currencies. And two, he built a team that could and did supply the infrastructure necessary to serve the obvious market demand (by quickly and capably adding new crypto markets).  By rapidly adding to the choice of crypto assets that its clients could invest in, Binance scaled to 3 million users in just six months.  An antithesis can be found in Coinbase’s business model. While the San Francisco exchange’s overall user growth was more impressive than Binance’s (they topped 20 million users in 2017), one can't as easily argue that they evolved the business as well.  Coinbase spent most of the 2017 bubble selling only a handful of assets (four in total), and benefiting from its position as the easiest fiat on-ramp for consumers. It wasn’t until 2018, when the entrance of new users had drastically slowed, that it began launching new assets, though this was largely amidst a period of waning consumer interest.  The end result was that, during the last cycle, Coinbase was essentially an onboarding platform for Binance, meaning users who started at Coinbase and other fiat exchanges were quickly forced, by virtue of its limited asset supply, to look for services elsewhere.  There were few other options and even fewer teams that executed as well.  The Miraculous BNB  But if it was heretical not to enable trading in U.S. dollars, CZ didn't just stop there.  Another aspect he seemed to implicitly understand was that since competitors could easily replicate his strategy of offering many cryptocurrencies, he would need built-in incentives to keep users on the exchange. Enter: Binance Coin.  Binance Coin (BNB) seemed like an excuse for an ICO at the time, but it's since been revealed to be a brilliant way to encourage repeat business.  By offering traders a way to speculate on a token that floated on a public market, and by enabling the exchange’s fees to be paid in that coin, Binance seems to have created a virtuous cycle by which its users were incentivized to stay within its platform.  Binance Coin now has an insanely large market cap of $2.3 billion, a number that has been growing a-cyclically in a down market).  (Note: This is not an argument so much for the present valuation of BNB, nor an analysis of what that can or should be, but an acknowledgement that Binance Coin is an innovation that the market should and is in the process of valuing).  Not content to rest on those laurels, Binance has created a network of additional products around BNB coin, such as ""LaunchPad,"" a service that conducts ICOs payable in BNB, thus further extending and incentivizing its ecosystem. (If you don't think this is impressive, again, remind yourself this is a company that, despite its now 300+ employees, hasn't lost its timing).  With incentives so well aligned, other exchanges have been rushing to replicate the model, including Huobi, OKcoin and a slew of other smaller exchanges.  That this is likely to become a staple of the exchange business model seems like a foregone conclusion. Could there seriously be a crypto exchange business that isn't studying what has been created here and thinking about what it means for their business?  I doubt it, as the need for such solutions can be seen across the exchange sector.  Kraken, for example, raised its recent $100 million funding round largely from its users, the logic being that those who invest in its future will be more likely to stay, thus providing liquidity, product feedback and other valuable input.  The message is clear – cryptocurrency exchanges, some of the largest and most profitable businesses in the industry have a big problem for which they're willing to consider any and all manner of solutions for, retaining users. Binance, it seems, not only anticipated the problem, but already has a solution.  An Ambitious Future  So, what's next for the exchange? Will it rest on its laurels until IPO? It doesn't seem so.  Binance appears set to soon launch a fiat-to-crypto gateway in Singapore, a move that would bring it, finally, under an influential regulator's purview. It's the kind of success you'd expect a CEO to tout on Twitter, right?  But bending to convention doesn't seem to be top of mind for CZ these days. In potentially the most dramatic pivot, Binance is working rapidly toward deploying a decentralized exchange, the Binance DEX, having already put it on testnet in February.  Decentralized exchanges, in which users would be able to trade cryptocurrencies peer-to-peer through a blockchain protocol – without the backing of a single service provider like Binance, are cutting-edge technology. None have been deployed at scale, and it remains to be seen what challenges lie ahead in their execution.  That Binance has embraced his direction, though, should give the market pause – it stands in sharp contrast to those being made by other major exchanges.  At a time when most appear to be adding old guard Wall Street professionals and taking on VC money with the intent on courting institutional money, Binance, it seems, sees a bigger prize in successfully building the next-generation version of the kind of product it originally created – cutting-edge tech that can massively scale for global retail consumption.  Critically, Binance's lack of VC funding and the freedom that affords means it is better placed than probably any other company to take its embrace of a decentralized exchange to its natural but extreme conclusion: handing over its operation completely to users of the BNB network.  In disrupting itself, Binance could even end up being something even more innovative than an exchange (decentralized or not) – a viable, crypto-native exit strategy.  If that's the case, the Binance story could even one day offer an alternative to the Silicon Valley narrative that companies should foster user growth only to pursue a conventional exit by going public.  Is all of this an over-read of Binance? Perhaps.  But after the company has amassed such a track record, there's maybe only one question left – who, exactly, is betting against Binance?

42402787,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcrL0,1554857966,Digital Asset Is Writing Code to Help ISDA Standardize Derivatives Data,"Enterprise blockchain company Digital Asset is working with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) to develop software meant to ease adoption of the trade group's potentially cost-slashing data standards.  Announced Tuesday night in New York, the reference code library is intended to help developers implement ISDA's Common Domain Model (CDM) in solutions for trading and managing derivatives. The software is written in DAML, the smart contract language created – and recently open-sourced – by Digital Asset.  “Following our success at the Barclays DerivHack in London last year, we have been working closely with ISDA with the joint goal of standardizing processes across the derivatives industry,"" Kelly Mathieson, head of enterprise solutions at Digital Asset, said in a press release. ""We are very excited to now make this reference implementation available to users ... enabling financial institutions to be in control of their own data.”  Stepping back, the CDM is a broad, ambitious initiative by ISDA, first proposed in 2017, to standardize the ways derivative trade events and processes are represented so that the IT systems of various entities can talk to each other, improving efficiency and trimming costs. U.K.-based megabank Barclays has estimated the CDM could save the financial sector $3 billion a year.  While CDM is not a blockchain-specific project, such data standardization is seen as a prerequisite for distributed ledger technology (DLT) to reap much of a benefit for the financial industry. Indeed, Barclays, a DLT trailblazer, has championed the effort, setting up an internal CDM adoption working group about a year ago. In June, ISDA published an initial digital representation of the CDM, so that the association's members can access and test it.  Making things simpler  Digital Asset's reference code library will help simplify and standardize the generation of derivative ""life cycle"" events (everything that happens over the course of a trade, from agreeing on terms to amending the contract to termination) defined in the ISDA CDM, the company said.  ""This may otherwise involve a number of complex steps. For example, generating payments involves rolling out a calculation schedule and applying date adjustments, before calculating day-count fractions and interest amounts as defined in the ISDA CDM,"" Digital Asset explained in a press release.  The reference code library will be available under an open-source license, and the specification will be compiled, or translated, ""to executable libraries in other languages,"" the company said. The ISDA CDM is now available in DAML on the ISDA's Rosettahttps://cdm.rosetta-technology.io/ portal, along with Java and JSON.  A spokesperson for Digital Asset said ISDA is not paying the company to develop the reference application.  One of the most prominent startups in enterprise DLT, New York-based Digital Asset is best known for its former CEO, Wall Street veteran Blythe Masters, and its ongoing assignment to replace back-office systems for the Australian Securities Exchange.
