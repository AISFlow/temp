42426932,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxenh,1465251232,Bitcoin Developers Meet in Zürich for High-Stakes Code Review,"A group of contributors to the open-source Bitcoin Core development project met late last month in Switzerland for a sit-down review of the code for Segregated Witness, a proposal aimed at scaling the bitcoin network.  The gathering in Zürich drew about 20 Core developers, and comes at a time when there remains deep divisions in the community over the actions of the group, as well as its approach to scaling the bitcoin network.  In this light, the meeting in Zürich had a certain gravity, given that the work being performed will have major implications for the bitcoin network’s trajectory in the months and years ahead. The Segregated Witness proposal follows discussion going back to mid-2015, though the broader question of scaling the bitcoin network has long been debated by developers.  It’s a process that isn’t without risk. The contributors to Bitcoin Core are perhaps best viewed as the guardians of as much as $9bn in value denominated in bitcoin. As the network is run on the code published by Bitcoin Core, a foul-up could expose users and their money to security risks.  This is not to say that the issues aren’t borne in mind by those contributing to the project, and the Segregated Witness proposal in particular.  In interview, contributor Eric Lombrozo said that the process of integrating SegWit into Bitcoin Core “is pretty high-stakes”, while at the same time defending the team’s position on scaling the network as a necessity to avoid technical problems.  Lombrozo argued that the soft fork approach to rolling out SegWit is the safer option, telling CoinDesk:  “It's a difficult challenge to [hard fork] without destabilizing the network. A very difficult challenge.”  Sit-down in Zurich  According to Lombrozo, the group wanted to avoid making any concrete decisions during the face-to-face meeting, both in terms of SegWit as well as broader development matters, leaving that to the community’s mailing list and chatroom-based meetings where the decision-making process is public.  This point was emphasized in remarks by contributor Jonas Schnelli, who advocated for this direction at the outset of the event, according to notes published by the Core team.  ""Don't feel too pressured to make code-based progress,"" Schnelli said. ""That we're able to sit together in one room and try to work together as a team is the value itself.""  This sentiment is perhaps a response to a central criticism levied against Core in the past – that it operates above or beyond the scrutiny of community members and stakeholders, particularly those who have called for an increase in the overall size of bitcoin transaction blocks. It was this argument, in part, that fueled work on alternate software versions like Bitcoin XT and, later, Bitcoin Classic.  Lombrozo, in conversation, pushed back against the idea that development on bitcoin has diverged from the interests of its users, arguing that he believes the team will exceed expectations at launch.  He continued:  ""The last year has seen this narrative arise that progress on tech is stagnant. This narrative was partly due to price stagnation... but also encouraged largely by a huge misunderstanding regarding what Core actually does and how Core functions.""  Code review  Yet in recent months the volunteer community has sought to reposition its development and communication processes to be more inclusive, something that began after tensions flared amid a perceived lack of progress earlier this year.  According to Core contributor Bryan Bishop, the in-person review in Zürich provided an opportunity for programmers to focus on work and dig more deeply into the code itself.  Effectively, those involved in the review would raise questions or concerns, which would then be put to whichever point person was involved with that aspect of development.  He told CoinDesk:  “Once each person is sufficiently convinced that outstanding issues have been resolved, they can proceed to other sections of the proposed change and continue this process. Each person has slightly different criteria for how thoroughly they think will check each portion of SegWit, and in combination between multiple people this means lots more coverage over each aspect of the proposed changes.”  This, he suggested, was an extension of the work already being performed today across the Core team’s online communication channels, including open-source chat protocol IRC and the bitcoin development mailing list.  Bishop further indicated that the team was able to identify a number of small issues present in the code.  “At the gathering, SegWit code review went pretty well. I believe there were a handful of trivial bugs found and fixed,” he said.  Moving forward  For now, those involved with the project say they’re focused on finalizing the code for SegWit, though no timetable has been given for its launch.  “I think we’re getting close to the point where we feel comfortable [launching] it,” Lombrozo said. “There’s just a few edge cases that still might need testing, or it’d be nice to have more people running it just to make sure we have more people giving us feedback on it.”  While indicating that those working on the upgrade ""want to merge SegWit as soon as possible"", such a launch would only follow a period of robust testing that has been ongoing for months, Lombrozo said.  ""A big thing was asked of us...and I think what we're delivering will be even better than what people thought not that long ago,"" he added.  Given the stakes – upgrading a globally distributed network of computers is no easy task – the next steps could prove pivotal not only for Core group of developers, but the future of the bitcoin network itself.  Though some in the community may not agree with its approach, all eyes will be on the Core team as SegWit inches closer to launch.

42426939,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxexh,1465244565,Bitcoin Exchanges Could Face New Regulations in the Philippines,"The central bank of the Philippines is looking to expand oversight of the country’s financial system following an embarrassing hack on the SWIFT international transfer system – a move that may ultimately result in new rules for domestic bitcoin services.  According to Reuters, officials for the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas are mulling whether to apply additional scrutiny to money exchangers in the Philippines, which could capture bitcoin exchanges that swap cash for digital currencies.  During an event organized by the central bank, deputy governor Nestor Espenilla, who oversees the institution’s supervision of banks, said discussions were ongoing.  Espenilla was quoted as saying:  ""That is what we are looking to do, whether it is now time to impose hard regulations for virtual currency operators. Right now, we look at them as akin to remittance companies.""  Earlier this year, a cyberattack on the central bank of Bangladesh resulted in the theft of $81m, which took place via the institution’s conduit to the SWIFT network. SWIFT is used as a clearing system for the world’s financial institutions, and flaws in the Bangladeshi central bank’s cybersecurity measures were blamed for enabling the intrusion.  The incident has sparked both criticism as well as a rethink of how these institutions access SWIFT. At the event, Espenilla said that central bank officials in the Philippines have organized a new working group to address potential flaws in its cybersecurity policies.  In March  , Espenilla suggested that any banks found at fault in the February hack could face penalties, according to Bloomberg.

42426936,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxevh,1465235432,90 Central Banks Seek Blockchain Answers at Federal Reserve Event,"Major central banks worldwide have spent the past year organizing their own working groups dedicated to exploring blockchain technology and digital currencies.  During a three-day event in Washington, DC, hosted by the World Bank, the Intentional Monetary Fund and the US Federal Reserve, representatives from a range of central banks worldwide offered private details about the ongoing work at their respective institutions.  At the gathering last week the central bank leaders expressed broad interest in how the technology might impact both the banks they regulate as well as their own regulatory practices, attendees say.  Perianne Boring, who is the president and founder of the DC-based Chamber of Digital Commerce, which helped organize the blockchain portion of the event, said in interview those institutions haven't made much of this work publicly known in the past.  Boring told CoinDesk:  ""What we learned is that there were a number of central banks around the world who have digital currency and blockchain focus groups. These aren’t things that were necessarily announced, but were discussed in off-the-record conversations.""  Blockchain and FinTech was the focus of the 16th annual three-day Conference on Policy Challenges for the Financial Sector, which began on 1st June at the Federal Reserve headquarters in DC.  Ninety central banks from around the world participated, according to organizers. The Federal Reserve declined comment.  Blockchain pitches  During the event, Chain CEO Adam Ludwin gave a keynote address about blockchain, followed by a panel discussion that featured Boring, Bloq founder Jeff Garzik, Nasdaq vice-president Fredrik Voss and Goldman Sachs managing director Tom Jessop.  It was in the aftermath of that panel, as well as in private conversations throughout the event, that Boring says the degree of engagement from central bank officials began to become apparent.  Central bank representatives posed a wide range of questions that demonstrated an “astute” and “attuned” understanding of the technology, she said.  According to Boring, a number of “higher level questions” came from central banks leaders from emerging markets in particular, drawn from institutions in both Africa and South America that expressed interest in how blockchains and digital currencies might help them compete globally.  Notably, central banks based in Asia reportedly expressed concern about the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin.  “It was really difficult for them to put trust in the system where they don’t know who the inventor was,” said Boring.  Bloq co-founder Matthew Roszak said in an interview that many of the attendees seemed interested in how they might leverage the technology in order to improve how their institutions operate.  Roszak told CoinDesk:  ""They’ve got an appreciation of what this tech does and what it can’t do. They can now view this as a tool to do their jobs better. They’re in the policy-making seats of central banks and this type of technology presents unprecedented visibility and transparency.""  Central banks take interest  Last week’s event was the first time a group of central bank officials this large has gathered to explore blockchain technology.  But over the course of the past few months, multiple central banks have taken a public stance on their potential use of distributed ledgers and digital currencies.  In recent statements  , an official with Russia’s central bank said that a state-sponsored digital currency was “still on the agenda” and that, if adopted, the technology could deliver a range of benefits.  A Bank of Japan official said last month that central banks around the world need to pay attention to blockchain. Both France’s central bank and Holland’s central bank have made public their efforts in the digital currency and blockchain spaces as well.  In February, the Financial Stability Board – an international organization composed of senior finance regulators and central bank officials from the world's major economies – began looking into the technology as a group, signaling that interest transcends the level of individual central banks.  Boring said that the Chamber of Digital Commerce has seen inbound interest from several central banks and expects to work closely with those institutions on further consultations.  ""A number of us have received requests to do briefing with various central banks,"" she said. ""There are a couple different central banks that have asked us to come in and elaborate in one-on-one sessions.""

42399101,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCNZ,1465227955,Bitcoin ATM Network Acquires Exchange Startup,"Bitcoin exchange startup BitQuick is being acqui-hired by a US-based digital currency ATM network, a move that comes months after it temporarily shut down following a cyberattack.  Athena Bitcoin  , which operates in the midwestern and eastern US, is buying the exchange outright as well as bringing in team members Jad Mubaslat and Chad Davis. The sale amount was not disclosed.  The integration quietly went live late last week, with the formal integration taking place today. In interview, Mubaslat said that in the immediate term, the team will continue to operate as it has previously, only with financial backing from Athena that will be used to expand the team’s size and capacity.  Mubaslat told CoinDesk:  ""Chad is going to continue working as customers service and I’ll continue to work in a leadership role, making sure the platform works as it was before.""  Gil Valentine, co-founder and COO of Athena Bitcoin, said that the all-digital exchange interface is a good complement to his company’s physical ATM network.  “We like the branding, we like the story, we like the way that Jad and Chad handled everything, and we think the brand is safe and sound,” he said.  Mubaslat said that the sale is unrelated to the March server breach, stating that the decision was driven by personal factors outside of the bitcoin space.  The service, a graduate of Silicon Valley-based startup incubator Boost VC, was taken offline in mid-March after someone gained access to its server. BitQuick later said that some customer details, including names and email addresses, were “likely” leaked following the incident.  Mubaslat said that while he understands possible security concerns following the hack, he defended BitQuick’s response and its subsequent transparency about what happened and said that any outstanding customer balances have since been refunded.  ""What we were doing is, right when it happened, we shut down the platform, we were transparent with everyone,” he said. “We let everyone know what happened.""

42399064,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCQW,1465225638,Class Action Lawsuit Resumes Against Bankrupt Bitcoin Miner KnC,"A class action lawsuit filed against troubled bitcoin startup KnCMiner is proceeding despite a recent legal setback and a bankruptcy filing by the firm.  According to emails provided to CoinDesk, lawyers representing the most prominent of several class action lawsuits filed against KnC have entered a claim against its bankruptcy estate in Sweden. Further, they indicated the group has provided information to local law enforcement in an attempt to ensure the firm can provide customer reparations.  An email to class action participants reads:  ""We have handed over all claims with the verifications to the criminal authorities for them to initiate the process of freezing KnC assets to cover your claim.""  The legal move comes amid what appear to be continued efforts by claimants after a verdict was rendered that KnC customers were businesses, not consumers, a finding that prohibited class action participants from obtaining consumer protections and reimbursement.  At the time of KnCMiner’s filing, management claimed that it would no longer be able to compete in the race for bitcoin rewards following an upcoming network rule change. Notably, the firm is not insolvent and it remains unclear if the bankruptcy will mark the end of the company's operations or if it will restructure.  Called a 'halving' event, the upcoming change will find the amount of rewards paid to new miners dropping from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC, a 50% decrease in potential profitability should the price not rise to offset the loss.  Once one of the larger bitcoin mining firms, KnC raised $32m in venture funding for its mining hardware products.  However, the company faced continued customer criticism for allegedly defective products and shipping issues that eventually forced it out of the business-to-consumer hardware market.  Representatives from KnCMiner did not respond to requests for further details.

42399072,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCWQ,1465217617,Why the CFTC Bitfinex Enforcement Actually Benefits Bitcoin Exchanges,"Kevin Batteh is currently a partner with Delta Strategy Group, the leading government affairs firm in the derivatives and blockchain industries. He is also an advisor to the Chamber of Digital Commerce, the world’s largest trade association representing the digital asset and blockchain industry.  In this op-ed, Batteh offers a perspective on the recent settlement between Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Businesses may loathe burdensome regulation, but they almost always welcome regulatory certainty, even if they are certain they don’t like the particular regulation. Regulatory certainty is predictable and allows businesses to comply with rules, to plan, and to avoid risks, like the risk of the government deciding to shut down their business.  Many of my clients tell me they would rather know what the rules are, even if they are bad rules, than operate in an uncertain regulatory environment with the threat of a costly enforcement action looming.  Trading in digital currencies or “tokens” – including bitcoin – is becoming more commonplace.  Today, bitcoin, ether and hundreds of other tokens are traded on global exchanges. While we can all be certain that digital currencies are here to stay, regulatory certainty around the exchange trading of digital currencies is lacking in many jurisdictions.  Exchanges play an important function in the blockchain ecosystem because they provide a place for price discovery of digital tokens, which is one of the key components of secure and successful blockchains.  Having regulatory certainty around the exchange trading of digital currency is a prerequisite to further mainstream investment in blockchain technology. Businesses want to know that there are regulated, well-run exchanges for the trading of digital tokens which support the blockchains they use.  Latest settlement  Last week, the CFTC took yet another step in providing greater regulatory certainty for participants in digital currency markets when it announced its latest bitcoin enforcement case against Bitfinex.  Before discussing the significance of this case, it is helpful to understand the evolution of CFTC regulation in this area.  Last year, the CFTC affirmatively planted a flag in the world of digital currency when the agency stated, in two separate enforcement actions, that digital currencies are “commodities” for the purpose of the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA” or the “Act”).  The two settlement orders stand for the proposition that digital currencies are encompassed in the definition of, and properly defined as, “commodities,” within the Act. Accordingly, digital currencies are subject to the applicable provisions of the CEA and its attendant regulations. This is particularly important to keep in mind in the context of trading digital currencies on exchanges.  The CFTC has a long history of aggressive enforcement in the area of retail foreign currency (“forex,” or “FX”) and commodity trading on so-called “spot” exchanges. Spot trading occurs when two parties buy and sell a commodity, “on the spot,” and the exchange occurs instantly; by analogy, think of cash on the barrel. This type of trading is largely outside the jurisdiction of the CFTC.  A short review of CFTC cases highlights many enforcement actions involving fraudulent schemes whereby individuals or companies acted as brokers or exchanges offering spot forex trading to retail customers. Offering parties in these cases told investors that they could control large positions with a small initial investment (i.e., leveraged trading).  Unbeknownst to the customer, there never was any foreign currency. The fraudsters would solicit customers to place buy and sell orders, but there was never any counterparty to buy or sell the commodity.  In fact, there was nobody on the other side of the trade: just the fraudster who would abscond with the customer’s funds. The traded commodity was never actually delivered to the customer, and instead, it was either held by the operator of the scheme or non-existent. By the time the fraud was realized, the investor’s money was long gone.  While the CFTC was sometimes successful in bringing these “boiler room” cases, the jurisdictional hurdle of proving that these so-called spot contracts were actually futures contracts within the CFTC’s jurisdiction was high.  Agency response  In response to these scams, the CFTC did two things: 1) it began to aggressively pursue enforcement cases against these bad actors, shutting down their businesses and obtaining civil monetary penalties (“CMP”), disgorgement of ill-gotten profits, and in some cases, compensation for customer losses whenever possible; and 2) it obtained a legislative change via Section 742 of the Dodd-Frank Act, by adding Section 2(c)(2)(D) to the CEA in 2010.  This amendment makes it easier for the CFTC to shut down these types of exchanges. The statutory change provides the CFTC the authority to bring a cause of action against unregistered operators offering leveraged, margined, or financed trading of commodities (like bitcoin or other digital currencies).  CEA Section 2(c)(2)(D)’s jurisdictional provision applies broadly to any agreement, contract, or transaction in any commodity that is entered into with, or offered to (even if not entered into with), a retail customer on a leveraged or margined basis, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar basis.  The Section further provides that such an agreement, contract, or transaction is subject to Sections 4(a), 4(b), and 4b of the Act “as if the agreement, contract, or transaction was a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery.”  In layman’s terms, in most cases, if you are offering trading in leveraged commodity contracts, you have to trade them on a registered futures exchange such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Intercontinental Exchange. Bye bye margin trading on unregistered digital currency exchanges. But wait! There is an important exception.  Section 2(c)(2)(D)(ii)(III)(aa) excepts from the CFTC’s jurisdiction, a contract of sale that results in “actual delivery” within 28 days …” The term “actual delivery” is clarified somewhat in an interpretive guidance issued by the CFTC in 2013. Under the guidance, unless the commodity is delivered to the customer in full, including the leveraged or financed portion of the trade, actual delivery will be deemed to have not been made.  Arguably, the Bitfinex settlement touches on all of these issues. The CFTC alleged that Bitfinex offered financed bitcoin trading without actually delivering bitcoins to the customer in certain instances.  Instead, according to the CFTC, Bitfinex held customers’ bitcoin at the exchange. In response to discussions with the CFTC, Bitfinex made changes to its offering to come into compliance with the CEA. While the concept of delivery is evolving and novel in the digital token space, given that Bitfinex still offers financed trading, one can assume that Bitfinex has received an overt (or at least tacit) blessing from the CFTC to continue financed trading.  While no company wants to be hit with an enforcement action, the outcome of this case is notable and somewhat remarkable. As part of the settlement, Bitfinex agreed to a CMP of $75,000 for alleged violations of the CEA.  Major takeaways  A $75,000 CMP might seem like a big number, but in the world of CFTC enforcement settlements, this is tiny and the equivalent to a slap on the wrist or a speeding ticket. Let’s unpack how the CFTC got to this relatively low civil penalty.  First, the CFTC went out of its way to acknowledge Bitfinex’s cooperation and the fact that Bitfinex affirmatively contacted the CFTC before the Coinflip settlement was issued (i.e., before the world knew for certain that the CFTC views bitcoin as a commodity).  Based on the facts set out in this order, it appears that Bitfinex tried to be a good corporate citizen and to affirmatively seek regulatory clarity from the CFTC. Bitfinex actively cooperated with the CFTC and provided information to the CFTC on a voluntary basis.  Second, almost as important as what is in the order, is what is not explicitly stated in the order. There is no allegation of fraudulent conduct on the part of Bitfinex (i.e., they were not running a pump-and-dump scheme or misappropriating customer funds). Bitfinex was not cheating customers. They were just trying to navigate regulatory uncertainty.  Third, Bitfinex took affirmative, remedial steps to make sure their activity comported with the delivery requirements of the CFTC before the CFTC asked them to do so. As noted above, the order acknowledges that Bitfinex made changes to its offering to attempt to come into compliance.  While Bitfinex avoided a crushing blow from the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement, other exchange operators should consider themselves on notice.  It is very likely that the CFTC will take a much more punitive approach to exchanges that continue to offer leveraged trading that does not comport with the letter and spirit of the delivery requirements. A digital currency exchange operator that does not comply with the leveraged commodity trading rule can expect to be the subject of an enforcement proceeding – which will likely entail a costly investigation, a hefty CMP, and the possibility of being shut down.  A trader trying to decide where to trade digital currency should strongly weigh the exchange’s history and its willingness to engage with regulators. While a CMP levied by a regulator won’t affect the funds of the trader, one must consider the exchange’s long-term ability to operate and to remain solvent if it were to be hit with a sizable fine.  In the end, this settlement should be seen as a positive development for all exchanges, traders and the miners who are the backbone of blockchains.  Greater regulatory certainty will lead to stronger and more secure blockchains by ensuring that businesses can invest in blockchains knowing that they have a robust, regulated market for price discovery, and that miners are fairly compensated for their efforts with fairly priced digital currencies.
