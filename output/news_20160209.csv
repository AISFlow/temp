42398869,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh7Cq,1455041678,Financial Stability Board Seeks 'Better Understanding' of Blockchain Tech,"The Financial Stability Board (FSB), a group of central bank governors and financial regulators from the world’s major economies, has begun working on blockchain technology issues.  The work was disclosed in a speech given by Subhash Sheoratan Mundra, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the country’s central bank.  Mundra, who was speaking at a regional banking conference on 4th February, brought up digital currencies and blockchain technology in the context of competition in payments from non-bank entities.  Declaring that “a massive disruption is possible”, Mundra went on to suggest that banks “would need to either develop own capability or seek proper alliances”, a possible reference to the consortia financial institutions have formed in the past year to investigate blockchain or distributed ledger technology.  Mundra went on to disclose that the FSB has begun work on the technology, telling the audience:  “I say this, however, with a caveat that we or rather the global regulatory community elsewhere have not taken a final stance on the use of distributed ledger technology. It is important to highlight here that [the] Financial Stability Board has already started consultations on developing [a] better understanding of the intricacies involved.”  The FSB was formed in 2009 in the wake of the global financial panic, and is aimed at guiding international policy decisions. The group is chaired by Mark Carney, who currently acts as the governor of the Bank of England, the UK’s central bank.  Mundra was one of several Indian central bank officials to remark on the technology during an appearance last August at the FIBAC 2015 banking conference in Mumbai.  ""These are the kinds of global innovations and by very nature and design ... it will be something which would need a global coordination rather than a framework which can be location specific,” he was quoted as saying at the time.

42398861,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh74y,1455039059,Linux Foundation-Led Blockchain Project Grows to 30 Members,"A distributed ledger effort being led by the Linux Foundation has revealed it now has 30 members, up from 20 when it was announced in December.  Formerly known as the Open Ledger Project, the Hyperledger Projecthttps://www.hyperledger.org/news/announcement/2016/02/hyperledger-project-announces-30-founding-members was first revealed in December as a cross-industry initiative boasting participants such as Cisco and IBM as well as blockchain industry startups such as Digital Asset Holdings and R3CEV.  New members include a diverse set of both established and new finance and technology companies such as ABN Amro, BNY Mellon, Calastone, CME Group, ConsenSys, Guardtime, Hitachi, IntellectEU, NEC, NTT Data, Red Hat and Symbiont.  In statements, Jim Zemlin, the technical director of The Linux Foundation, sought to frame the new participants as proof that there is demand for open standards in the distributed ledger industry, and that the Hyperledger Project is poised to help the technology connect to the enterprise market in a similar manner as Linux, the popular open-source operating system.  Zemlin said:  ""Working on its own even the largest global corporation could not match the speed at which our new members are moving blockchain technology forward. Such a broad effort and investment is sure to have a great impact on our personal and professional lives.""  So far, the Linux Foundation said it has received code contributions from Blockstream, IBM, Ripple and Digital Asset, the latter of which has released some details about the code it has made available.  Other community members, it said, are ""contemplating contributions to the effort"", which will then be reviewed by a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) that aims to promote transparent decision-making.  ""This group will oversee the project’s technical direction and working groups as well as manage multiple contributions to the code base,"" the release said. ""The TSC will be evaluating proposed contributions and go through an open community process to build out the initial and unified codebase.”  A separate governing board will manage the effort’s intellectual property, such as the Hyperledger branding, which was donated to the effort by Digital Asset after it was purchased in an acquisition early last year.  In addition, the Hyperledger Project has indicated it will seek to elect a board of directors to guide business decisions and marketing, for which nominations are now open.

42398866,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh7As,1455036373,US Bankruptcy Court Set to Weigh in on Bitcoin's Currency Status,"A California bankruptcy court is set to weigh in on whether bitcoin should be considered a currency.  The hearing, set for 19th February, follows months of legal wrangling between the trustee of bankrupt bitcoin mining firm HashFast and Marc Lowe, a former promoter for the service who operated under the handle 'CypherDoc'.  Trustee Michael Kasolas filed suit against Lowe in February of last year, seeking to recoup 3,000 bitcoins that had been paid by HashFast to Lowe for promoting the service, including a series of posts on the Bitcoin Talk forum.  The trustees alleged that Lowe was an insider who received preferential treatment from the firm, including the awarding of a refund while other customers were awaiting theirs, prior to HashFast’s bankruptcy.  Commodity or currency?  In a 22nd January filing, the trustees asked for a summary judgment requiring that Lowe return the 3,000 bitcoins, as well as – perhaps more importantly – a determination that bitcoin is a commodity rather than a currency.  By doing so, the court would essentially require that Lowe pay back the 3,000 BTC at today’s rate rather than the value, in dollar terms, when he received it in September 2013.  The filing states:  “Accordingly, the Court should grant the Motion and enter an order directing that if the subject transfers are avoided, the estate’s recovery shall be either the 3,000 bitcoin themselves or the value of those bitcoin at the transfer date or time of recovery, whichever is greater. This result is consistent with both established Ninth Circuit law and section 550(a)’s purpose of restoring the estate to the financial condition it would have enjoyed had the transfers not occurred.”  Predictably, Lowe pushed back, seeking the opposite ruling in a 5th February court filing. The heart of his argument was that, during the time he was promoting HashFast’s products, the company was treating bitcoin as a type of currency.  “The bitcoin Dr. Lowe received from HashFast should be treated as currency, not a commodity,” the filing states. “That was how HashFast intended bitcoin to be treated at the time it sent the bitcoin to Dr. Lowe, and that is how federal agencies, merchants, courts, the Debtor, and the Trustee himself have treated bitcoin. The Court should not grant the Trustee the undeserved windfall he is seeking.”  Further, Lowe asked the court to reject the trustee’s claim that the bitcoin transfers were fraudulent in nature.  The suit stems from the firm’s presale of HashFast’s BabyJet bitcoin mining products, which some customers said they did not receive after paying thousands of dollars per unit. HashFast later denied it was facing insolvency, but ultimately ended up in bankruptcy court.  Last August, a US district court judge approved fraud claims against the firm and two of its executives.  Both sides cite regulatory precedent  In their filing from 22nd January, the trustees point to decisions by the US Internal Revenue Service and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that deemed bitcoin a type of property or commodity, respectively, as backing.  Acknowledging that bitcoin can and has been used as a medium of exchange, the trustees go on to state that because it is deemed as a kind of property or commodity, the bitcoin in question would appreciate in value – a fact that should be “to the benefit of creditors and the estate”.  “The law on recovery under section 550(a) [of the US Bankruptcy Code] is well-settled and indisputable,” the filing goes on to state. “The Court should grant the Motion and enter an order directing that, if the transfers are avoided, the estate is entitled to recover either the 3,000 bitcoin or the value of the bitcoin measured at the transfer date or the time of recovery, whichever is greater.”  In his response, Lowe pointed to rulings by the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Securities and Exchange Commission, both of which have deemed bitcoin to be a kind of money, or a substitute for money, for regulatory purposes.  Further, the defense pushed back against what it called a misinterpretation of the IRS and CFTC rulings.  “Like the IRS guidance, the CFTC order is regulating bitcoin in essentially the same manner as it regulates other forms of currency. The CFTC merely defined bitcoin as property or a commodity for the purposes of regulating it, while at the same time essentially acknowledging that it is a currency,” the filing states. “Accordingly, the Trustee's argument with regard to the CFTC is nothing more than semantics, asking the Court to adopt a form over substance interpretation.”  Kasolas is being represented by San Francisco-based law firm Duane Morris LLP, while Lowe is being represented by Brian Klein of Los Angeles-based law firm Baker Marquart LLP and David Poitras of Jeffer Mangels Butler & Mitchell LLP.

42398857,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh712,1455016631,Why Microsoft Wants 'Every Blockchain' on its Azure Platform,"While Microsoft tested the waters with bitcoin at the tail end of 2014, the tech giant appears poised to be a far bigger player in the burgeoning market for solutions that harness its underlying blockchain technology.  Since opening its Azure cloud computing platform to the ecosystem this October, Microsoft has added a steady stream of partners to its blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) solution – a product styled as a kind of 'sandbox' where partners can interact with different technologies, from smart contracts to blockchain-based tax reporting services, in a low-risk environment.  Far from starting with the biggest, venture capital-backed players, however, Microsoft has so far turned heads with its frequent, and often unpredictable, partnership announcements for the service.  For example, in October, Microsoft chose to debut its BaaS service not with later partners like $32m bitcoin startup BitPay or recordkeeping service Factom (infamous for its now stalled but well-publicized ""partnership"" with Honduras), but with a then-relatively unknown distributed applications company called ConsenSys.  Since then, Microsoft has backed efforts on all manner of blockchain services, from long-standing altcoin projects with novel blockchains (Emercoin) to 'build-your-own' blockchain solution providers (MultiChain).  However, according to Microsoft's director of technology strategy, Marley Gray, there won't be any shortage of new blockchain players added to its Azure platform, given that it is designed for development and testing.  Gray told CoinDesk:  ""We want, and frankly our customers want, access to every blockchain. It could be two guys in a garage that forked bitcoin and had this genius idea and people want to try that out. We don’t want to have any barriers. We’re open to all. We help even the smallest of players onboard.""  Gray indicated the plan is for the Azure BaaS platform to scale up into a ""certified blockchain marketplace"" by this spring and that, at this stage, the technology providers undergo a more serious security vetting.  Until then, however, he sees the platform as one that should foster an environment of education and collaboration, with products that seek to appeal to users seeking to learn through trial and error.  Gray further sought to suggest that Microsoft was wary of acting as a 'gatekeeper' for the service, given that the technology is still in its early stages.  ""We’re not going to pick a winner,"" he added. ""Even if we tried to, the market wouldn’t want the one we picked.""  Avoiding competition  In interview, Gray was keen to frame Microsoft’s new offering given the recent influx of big-name technologists, banks and professional services firms to the ecosystem – all of whom seem intent on helping institutions make their new interest in all things blockchain actionable.  For example, Internet payment firm Earthport has spun up a similarly positioned service that focuses on connecting banks and payment providers to the Ripple protocol. Gray, on the other hand, described Microsoft’s goal as helping facilitate interaction between clients and protocol-level blockchain providers  ""We're looking at places where we’re not competing with our customers and partners, but we’re trying to be that platform company we’ve traditionally been,"" Gray explained.  In this light, he categorized the work ongoing at companies such as Accenture, Deloitte, Ernst & Young and KPMG as more focused on their traditional domain – applying blockchain technology to business use cases, an area in which he doesn’t believe Microsoft can, or should, compete.  ""Vertical expertise will come from our traditional vertical partners,"" Gray said. ""You’re not going to see us writing an equities trading platform.""  Instead, Gray lauded Microsoft's product for its success allowing partners to provide potential clients with access to their technology in a way that ""provides rapid feedback"" and allows them to more quickly respond to customer demand.  In a blog post, Gray summarized this strategy as one that allows users to ""fail fast and cheap"".  Taking a neutral stance  As for how Microsoft sees its efforts in contrast to consortiums formed by major banks, Gray sought to position the tech giant as providing a neutral, ""Switzerland-type"" environment for development.  Alongside development sandboxes, consortiums have emerged as an increasingly favored path for banks and financial institutions seeking to better understand the technology. The most famous to date, R3CEV, has so far signed up 42 banks to its effort, and is seeking to expand its mandate beyond this demographic.  But, these networks aren’t optimized to handle participants' every need, Gray contends.  Consortia projects, he believes, can leverage the Azure platform to offset the need for traditional types of trust agreements in permissioned blockchain networks.  While bitcoin’s blockchain has an almost Darwinian 'every entity for itself' environment commonly termed “trustless”, consortiums so far seem interested in replicating existing trust-based relationships in a distributed ledger environment.  One concrete example where Microsoft's services can serve as an arbiter, Gray said, is in cryptographic key storage.  ""When a consortium owns the keys to the kingdom, they can be kept on Azure and not by an individual bank,"" he said. ""They may want the consortium to be able to do the management, but they may also want to own their own resources.""  He also sought to position cloud offerings as a more mature testing environment for such efforts – a claim evidenced by the fact that R3 used Azure as part of its first completed blockchain test with 11 major banks.  Hastening innovation  As for the current version of Azure’s BaaS service, Gray stressed that it is ""fully open"" to the public now, and that clients can deploy blockchains either directly in Azure or in a local data center via its platform.  For cloud users, blockchains can be deployed by clients who ""fill out a web interface and click go"". From there, Marley said, they can be managed like any virtual machine in a cloud environment, with users quickly adding blockchain networks.  Such mechanisms, however, are currently developed by application providers and not Microsoft. So, for example, developers looking to run Ethereum on a virtual machine will need to deploy via a template created by tech platform provider BlockApps.  Gray described this ability for innovators and incumbents to interact in energetic terms, suggesting that Microsoft sees Azure as a way to ramp up the pace of innovation in the blockchain sector.  ""You can have a private cloud, but nodes can be sitting under people’s desks. If they’re permissioned to join the blockchain, they can join,"" Gray said.  In this way, he suggested the BaaS is a way for the company to replicate its own experimentation process, and its successes.  ""We initially launched the BaaS platform to include numerous blockchain platforms … to allow customers and partners and developers to try these things out to figure out the strategies,” he said, concluding:  ""Now we can automate the setup and get it down to 20 minutes in a blockchain environment.""
