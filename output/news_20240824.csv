According to CoinGecko, the token is up more than 24% since last week which is currently supported by the strong bullish sentiment present within the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Floor: CEO Predicts $38,000 Will Be The Lowest BTC Goes However, Optimism might have more surprises as the platform announces a major partnership that may turn the tide for Optimism with Sony entering the Web 3 and crypto space with Soneium, a venture with Startale Labs. Sony Enters Web 3 With Soneium In a press release yesterday, Sony announced the creation of Soneium, their first venture into the Web 3 and crypto space. According to their press release, the Soneium blockchain will be used to “explore and develop a plan to make the network public and aim to create new services by leveraging the various businesses and IP within the Sony Group.” This becomes a great deal for the crypto community. The blockchain’s focus on Web 3 games and NFTs might revive the retail interest in both industries, possibly placing the highlight on NFTs in the long-term. The chain was built using the Optimism stack, making it part of the platform’s superchain. Soneium is also EVM-compatible, making the platform easy to use for developers. As the new blockchain matures, Optimism can expect new bullish momentum on its platform and OP. $1.5-$1.6 Trading Range Remains Unbreakable For Optimism Despite the bullishness OP has found on this level, the token continues to be rejected on the $1.6 ceiling. This places new pressure on the bulls to perform, even tho they’re supported by favorable market conditions and institutional support from centralized organizations like Sony. It will take some time for Optimism to resume its upward trajectory. Being in a narrow trading range, the bulls have little wiggle room to grab gains, moving the bullish breakthrough in the next few weeks or months. However, the positive developments might shorten this timeframe by a couple of days as long-term speculators enter the market. With Soneium entering a maturation phase, Optimism will be affected by the development of the former. But OP’s high market correlation with BTC might be a double edged sword for the token.

This unexpected yet substantial transaction comes as Bitcoin’s price surges past $64,000. Related Reading: Floki Has ‘More Room To Climb,’ Targets 96% Rally – Analyst Decade Old Bitcoin Wallet Springs Back To Life An old Bitcoin wallet established 10.7 years ago has executed a large-scale BTC transaction on August 19. Blockchain tracker and analytics system, Whale Alert, disclosed on X (formerly Twitter) that the address had contained 19 BTC, worth about $13,259 in 2013. The Bitcoin wallet which has been inactive for years, most likely due to strategic HODLing, now boasts impressive gains of about 8,844%, fueled by the cryptocurrency’s consistent yet dramatic price increase since 2013. Additionally, the sudden wallet activation comes as Bitcoin’s price surges past the $64,000 price mark after experiencing a significantly bearish phase. With Bitcoin’s current price, the 19 BTC moved by this decade-old wallet address is now worth over $1,185,944, marking a significant profit with a gain of $1,172,685. The transaction records also show that the anonymous sender transferred the Bitcoin to an unknown address, incurring a fee of 0.000047 BTC. Typically, when a Satoshi era Bitcoin wallet suddenly springs back to life, it often indicates a potential for increased market activity. Dormant wallets that move substantial amounts of Bitcoin tend to impact market liquidity and price movements. Meanwhile, smaller Bitcoin transactions could capture the interest of the crypto community, prompting speculations. Bitcoin Turns Bullish With $64,000 Price Surge Over the past few months, the price of Bitcoin has struggled to rebound to its March all time high of more than $73,000. The cryptocurrency witnessed sudden price crashes and constant fluctuations due to large scale market liquidations and shifts in investor sentiment. After a long period of consolidation, Bitcoin is finally showing signs of a bullish rebound. CoinMarketCap’s data shows that the cryptocurrency surged by 5.33% in the last 24 hours, and is now trading at $64,311. Over the past week, Bitcoin also recorded an 8.6% increase, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s renewed strength and potential for a major price recovery. Many analysts are viewing the cryptocurrency’s steady price increase as a bullish signal, potentially indicating a substantial price reversal from bearish trends. Popular crypto analyst, Ali Martinez noted in an X post that the Bitcoin bull-bear market indicator has oscillated between bearish and bullish since early August. However, with the cryptocurrency experiencing new price gains, the indicator has now switched back to a bullish stance. Related Reading: Stacks: New Developments Push STX Price 18% Higher – Details Additionally, a crypto market expert identified as ‘Milkybullcrypto,’ highlighted that Bitcoin is finally breaking out of the bullish reversal price pattern.

The platform’s finality times were compared to other layer 1 blockchains like Near, BNB, and Ethereum. According to the thread, the network’s finality times are caused by “carefully engineered optimizations focused on several key areas from optimized state synchronization and data handling to enhanced resource management.” 1/5 Injective continues to push the boundaries of blockchain scalability, with recent upgrades delivering the fastest speeds imaginable.

Another aspect that Injective is looking towards is the institutional aspect of crypto. The extremely low block times will help attract traditional financial institutions to the platform with speeds rivaling that of the top crypto networks. Injective Integrates With Balance, Expanding Network Services This week, Injective also announced the integration of Balance, a cross-chain decentralized finance platform (DeFI), on the Injective mainnet. The integration opens new opportunities for investors and traders as it introduces new assets like bnUSD, Balance’s native stablecoin. The partnership also enables overcollateralized loans on the platform. This enables users to use any asset as collateral, giving them up to two-thirds of the collateral’s value as a loan. With a low 2% fixed interest, users on the platform can flexible loan terms with fast block time finality with Injective. INJ Faces Rejection On This Level, But With A Possible Rebound As of press time, the token’s momentum, although still significantly bullish, is facing rejection on the $0.39 ceiling, trapping the token in the narrow $0.36-$0.39 range. This range might pressure the bulls to lose momentum in the short term. Related Reading: Floki Has ‘More Room To Climb,’ Targets 96% Rally – Analyst At this point, the token’s correlation with Bitcoin and its most recent developments has squeezed the last bit of bullishness out of INJ, possibly opening the doors to a downward trajectory in the coming days.

32793457,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637582,1724520619,Shiba Inu Breaks Above Trendline: Can The Bulls Drive SHIB To $0.00002045?,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently surged past a key bullish trendline, sparking fresh optimism among traders and investors. This breakout marks a significant shift in momentum that could pave the way for a potential rally toward the $0.00002045 level. As the market eyes this potential rally, all attention turns to whether SHIB can sustain its upward trajectory and reach this ambitious target, or will the bears step in to stall the run? This article provides an in-depth technical analysis of Shiba Inu’s recent breakout above the trendline, evaluating whether this could trigger a rally toward the $0.00002045 target. Additionally, it will explore potential price reactions once SHIB approaches this critical level. In the last 24 hours, Shiba Inu has gained over a 6% increase, reaching approximately $0.00001519. The crypto asset’s market capitalization has surpassed $8.9 billion, with trading volume exceeding $311 million. Over this period, the market cap has increased by 6.59%, while trading volume has surged by 85.23%. Trendline Breakout: A Bullish Signal For Shiba Inu? Following the breakout above the trendline, SHIB’s price has maintained its bullish momentum, consistently trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart. This sustained positive sentiment reflects strong upward momentum, signaling that the bulls are firmly in control and could push the price toward the next significant resistance level at $0.00002045. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is currently at 73% showing that Shiba Inu is in an overbought territory. A sustained overbought condition signals strong buying pressure suggesting that bullish momentum remains robust in the market. On the daily chart, although SHIB is experiencing a short-term pullback, it is attempting to move toward the 100-day SMA following a successful breakout above the bearish trendline. The appearance of a bullish momentum candlestick on the previous day indicates a strong bullish sentiment, which could drive the cryptocurrency towards further gains. Finally, the 1-day RSI indicates that SHIB’s bullish momentum is strengthening, with the signal line moving toward the overbought region after recently crossing above 50%. The upward movement in the RSI suggests intensifying buying pressure and growing bullish sentiment for the asset. Potential Market Reactions: What Happens If SHIB Hits $0.00002045? Potential price reactions when Shiba Inu reaches $0.00002045 include a breakout above this level or a potential rebound. If Shiba Inu breaks above the $0.00002045 level, it could signal the beginning of a sustained bullish rally toward the $0.00002631 resistance level. A successful break above this level could propel the asset toward the next resistance at $0.00002960, with the potential for even higher gains. However, if the cryptocurrency encounters a rebound at the $0.00002045 resistance level, the price may retrace to its previous low of $0.00001272.

MARA has potential additional revenue streams through products like 2PIC and MARAFW. These are like a pick and shovels play to Bitcoin mining. Risks include potential lack of product market fit for tech solutions, reliance on BTC price fluctuations, and focus on hashrate growth over BTC acquisition. MARA, formerly Marathon Digital ( MARA ) before they rebranded the company, is the biggest publicly traded Bitcoin miner by hashrate. MARA’s latest actions suggest it is pursuing BTC Yield, a KPI pioneered by MicroStrategy (MSTR), to increase BTC per share. I have written about BTC as a treasury reserve asset in the past. Today, my position is quite simple: increasing BTC per share is accretive and a form of generating value for shareholders. Almost all of my assets are invested in either BTC or equities which have the ability to increase BTC per share. The increase of BTC per share is termed “BTC Yield” by MicroStrategy. Because MSTR pioneered the concept of BTC treasury reserves, I will use this term to describe this new corporate finance strategy. The reality is that companies on this path tend to outperform. MSTR is the best example of this. It is a mediocre software business which prioritized BTC Yield and here are the results after a few years: MSTR Outperformance (MicroStrategy) It seems like MARA is now aggressively pursuing BTC yield because it is a Bitcoin miner that is also purchasing BTC via securities issuances. MARA did an offering of $250 million of senior convertible notes but this was heavily oversubscribed so they closed the round with $300 million. Most of the money was used to purchase BTC, which has now caused MARA’s BTC holdings to swell to over 25,000 BTC . This is the first high profile example I have seen of a Bitcoin miner also purchasing BTC. After all, miners are automatically receiving their revenues in BTC directly from the Bitcoin block reward. They even have to sell the BTC they have mined to cover the cost of power, maintenance, and administrative overhead. Many miners do hold the BTC they have mined, but to actually raise more money to buy more BTC from the market, while also mining it, is unheard of to me. Personally, I really like it. Cost To Mine MARA is mostly covered in that its cost per BTC isn’t that high compared to other miners. Here is a chart from Hut8 ( HUT ) investor presentation about the cost per coin. MARA is definitely on the lower end of cash expenses, though it is on the higher end when it comes to all-in cost, which excludes energy monetization. Cost per coin (Hut8) This study from CryptoRank roughly confirms HUT’s numbers regarding MARA. In terms of free market competition, a cost per coin under $30,000 means a 50% profit margin given a BTC price of $60,000. Now, these are pre-halving numbers. After the halving, MARA would be a lot closer to breaking even. Only A Few More Questions Remain As I have covered in a sobering analysis of Bitcoin miners , mining is probably the most perfectly competitive industry in history. Thus, it is bad to be a shareholder here because basic economics shows that perfect competition results in 0 economic profits. The “alpha” for miners then becomes whether they are able to monetize other things which function in parallel to the mining activity they do. I gave a few examples of this in the article : The differentiator between miners as corporate entities and not only as mining operations will come from a few places: Does the miner hold some of the mined BTC? If so, then it needs to be valued based on those balance sheet assets as well. At that point, the business is really two businesses: a BTC holding company and a mining operation. Does the miner derive revenue outside of just mining BTC? Astute observers may note that some miners have received money from government entities for their assistance in stabilizing the local grid. That is additional revenue which should flow to the shareholders. There are also other external revenues, such as merge mining, which even less people are aware of. I also mentioned that some miners are transitioning their infrastructure to support AI and HPC. These forms of computing offer much higher revenue but do not have the flexible load benefit of mining. MARA is doing a lot of things right here. It is creating additional revenue which exists in parallel to mining while also holding onto the BTC it mines. In fact, it is doing even more on this second front because it is actively raising capital to purchase more BTC. Let’s talk about additional revenues first. There are several exciting things, which you can see on the MARA tech suite website , but here I will only cover the two I view as having strong potential for outsized revenue generation. These two are basically the pick and shovels to the mining gold rush (or Bitcoin rush). The first is 2PIC , which stands for “2-Phase Immersion Cooling.” Without getting into the deep technical details: mining generates a lot of heat for machines, and immersing machines in special cooling fluid is a way to enhance performance and lower the long term maintenance costs of a mining rig. Immersion cooling actually works for all kinds of computers, including GPU clusters which are used in AI. 2PIC is a special kind of superior immersion solution pioneered by MARA. I have witnessed the MARA team pitch 2PIC at multiple Bitcoin and mining related conferences in the last few months. Reception has been extremely positive. If MARA is able to sell their specialized solution to other miners, then they’d effectively be selling the tools to better mining profitability, generating more income in the mining space without actually mining more. The best thing about 2PIC is that it works for HPC too. It is pick and shovels for the rush to both Bitcoin mining and AI. The second is MARAFW , which stands for “MARA Firmware.” Mining firmware is usually installed on mining machines to support autotuning and overclocking. Without getting into the deep technical details: these two things increase the hashrate output of a machine. If something normally consumes 20 watts for 1 terahash (ie. “20 J/Th efficiency”) and has a normal output of 100 terahashes per second (ie. “hashrate of 100 Th/s”), then overclocking and autotuning could boost the machine to 165 Th/s at an average efficiency of 23 J/Th. MARAFW is a proprietary firmware developed by MARA which increases the hashrate without decreasing efficiency. The chart below shows MARAFW’s competitiveness against other firmwares. Note that the lower blue line signals that the energy per hash isn’t going higher, which means the machines using MARAFW are more efficient as they are pushed to higher hashrates. MARAFW (MARA) Firmware is generally monetized by giving some of the hashrate on the machine to the firmware developer. For instance, if your 100 Th/s was increased to 150 Th/s, then maybe 10 Th/s will be sent to mine BTC that ultimately accrues to the firmware developer’s wallet. Given the obvious competitiveness of MARAFW, there’s a case to be made that this could be another revenue driver for shareholders. Buying Bitcoin: Massively Bullish MARA is now buying BTC with money raised from capital markets. Recently, it used $249 million of the $300 million convertible debt offering to purchase BTC for their treasury. They are clearly using the MicroStrategy playbook, where they are selling shares which are trading at a premium to the BTC they hold and sweeping these proceeds into BTC. This strategy can be taken one step further by issuing convertible debt against the equity of a leveraged BTC balance sheet. I describe this in detail in my article about corporate adoption of BTC treasuries . The higher implied volatility, thanks to leveraged BTC, causes the interest rate on convertible debt to be extremely low. In this case, MARA is borrowing at 2.125%, while the risk free rate is roughly twice as large. In short, companies can sell the volatility of their own “Bitcoinized” capital structure and sweep funds into buying BTC, and they can always sell this volatility because they have the power to issue their own shares. The result of buying BTC with capital raises is that it directly increases BTC per share and is therefore accretive from the perspective of someone who is looking to increase the number of BTC they own. Relative to all the public miners, MARA is pretty well-placed to do this because they could likely hold onto nearly all the BTC they mine while using the cash flows from 2PIC, MARAFW, Slipstream, and hosting to pay for their self-mining expenses. (To be clear, this isn’t the case right now, but this situation may emerge if their tech suite gains more traction). Another accretive move, though I doubt they will do this, is to actually sell some of their mining machines for BTC. Machines tend to degrade over time and are outclassed by newer models. Mining itself isn’t a good game to be in long term due to how competitive it is. BTC acquisition is a better game, and it is also what MARA is signaling with these moves. Overall, MARA will trade like a leveraged version of BTC. Now that it has 25,000 BTC plus debt, its equity is somewhat leveraged BTC. Mining itself approximates a call option on BTC, where the strike price is the cost to mine a single coin. Finally, the auxiliary products which MARA is offering are also optionality on the long term adoption of Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining. Lastly, BTC per share is expected to grow over time. Risks I think there are many risks to MARA, and this is largely why I have not taken the position yet. First, I don’t know if they will hold that BTC forever. I remember that MARA was selling its holdings back in 2021 during the bear market while MSTR was buying. Selling low is poor capital management, even if they probably had little choice at the time. Mining is a business with bad margins, and I think many publicly traded miners want to show an increase in hashrate even though this is value destructive in the long run. If I were a shareholder, I would generally be more comfortable with miners purchasing more BTC instead of more machines and power agreements. The latter creates unnecessary risk. I look at the management's statements on earnings calls and it just seems like they want to grow the hashrate. When I see that MARA has also started mining Kaspa , it just indicates that hashrate growth and doing actual mining remains a big and frankly unproductive focus at MARA. Kaspa as a crypto asset is, by all indications, a short term thing. It cannot compete with BTC as money and it cannot compete with Ethereum as a smart contract platform. Another major risk is that the tech solutions do not find good product market fit. This would be very value destructive because MARA would have invested a lot time into building these without getting a return for it. It would have been better to just buy BTC with that money. Overall I’m not completely convinced that it would be possible to mine BTC and also raise money to buy it for the long term. The only way this could work is if the other cash flows from selling 2PIC and MARAFW can actually cover the electric costs of mining and the interest expenses on these capital raises. We’ll have to wait and see. The last risk is of course the intimate connection to Bitcoin. Any negative price action on BTC will probably be reflected on MARA, and with some higher beta too. Conclusion Overall, I rate this stock a Hold, on the fringe of a speculative buy. I think it is fairly valued given the risks. I want to see more certainty that there is a buffer of non-mining cash flows which can support the mining operation and service debt. I want to see the numbers for ancillary product lines once they have been battle tested on the market. Tagging on BTC acquisition is exciting but it’s more about being able to hold through the thick and thin.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4716896-mara-stock-top-miner-now-mining-and-buying-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32788152.jpeg

The price of Ethereum in particular moved upward by 6.38% to nearly breach the $2800 price mark. However, amidst this crypto market raving with bullish sentiments, the Ethereum Foundation (EF), a non-profit organization committed to supporting the Ethereum network, has offloaded a substantial amount of ETH. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst: Bulls Must Hold $2,500, Spot ETF To Catalyze Demand Ethereum Foundation Executes Largest ETH Sale Of 2024 According to on-chain analytics firm, Spot on Chain, the EF, which is devoted to financing critical developments on the Ethereum network, has been selling small amounts of its holdings in the last few months culminating in 2516 ETH for $7.4 million DAI. On Friday, the Ethereum Foundation executed its largest sale transaction of 2024 depositing 35,000 ETH worth $93.8 million on the Kraken exchange. Generally, whale transactions of this size usually draw much attention as they are indicative of the market’s next likely movement. In particular, this latest transaction by the Ethereum Foundation has been highly speculative, due to the direct affiliation of the organization with the Ethereum network, with some ETH enthusiasts interpreting such a sale as a bearish signal. Notably, in the last few hours following the sale, ETH has experienced a slight decline of 1.3%. However, general market sentiment remains largely bullish with an anticipated rate cut by the Fed in September. Rate cuts, an inverse of rate hikes, mean lower interest rates which allow investors to acquire more volatile assets such as cryptocurrencies. Following Powell’s announcement on Friday, experts are predicting a rate cut of 30-50bps which could exert relatively positive effects on the crypto market including ETH. Moreover, the recent price surge may help reduce the effect of the immediate expiry of 140,000 ETH options. This is because the assets’ current price ($2750) is far above the max pain point of these options at $2625, i.e. maximum financial losses would occur if the time of option expiration occurred at this market price. Finally, the Ethereum Foundation still retains a large horde of 273,273.96 ETH valued at $754.76 million. Their most recent market transaction, while significant, does not indicate a lack of confidence in Ethereum.

32785352,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637569,1724499047,"Floki Has ‘More Room To Climb,’ Targets 96% Rally – Analyst","Crypto analyst Javon Marks has just highlighted FLOKI as a digital asset that could register an impressive growth. In a post on X, Marks noted that if FLOKI confirms a so-called Hidden Bull Divergence, gains of over 96% can be expected. Related Reading: Bitcoin Floor: CEO Predicts $38,000 Will Be The Lowest BTC Goes This technical pattern implies an upsurge once the FLOKI breaks above $0.000276 resistance. If level breaks up, Marks thinks FLOKI may rise to $0.000546, and with “more room to climb.” That is an overall optimistic view, which aligns with a more comprehensive view given by crypto price prediction platform CoinCodex, projecting its value to increase by 227% by September 22, 2024. Recent Performance And Market Dynamics Despite the recent slump, FLOKI is doing a good job of catching investors’ attention. The token rose 15% in just a week, which could be quite a rally. On the back of this uptick are positive technical indicators, new strategic partnerships, and an anticipated airdrop announcement. Coming off of a recently confirmed Hidden Bull Divergence, sights for $FLOKI (Floki Inu), in response to this divergence is still on an over 96% climb back above the $0.0002761498 target which may only open up even more room for climbing! With a break above this target,… https://t.co/w3iDJDPeZU pic.twitter.com/SSr3iaLB5F — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) August 22, 2024 These are very positive factors, all brewing a lot of interest around this token, making it one of the more talked-about meme coins of late. FLOKI also experienced turbulence. The crypto market collapse in early August drove the token down 65% from $0.00034 on June 5 to $0.000096. However, its 15% comeback from that level has spurred anticipation of a revival. Airdrop Backed By Binance Boosts Confidence One major development is that Binance will support FLOKI’s upcoming airdrop of the Simon’s Cat token, CAT. Starting August 29, 2024, Binance will snapshot balances for this airdrop eligibility, where approximately 315 billion CAT tokens are given to every wallet with at least 400,000 FLOKI tokens. This airdrop is seen to be strategic in keeping up rewards for the FLOKI community, which faced a bot-ruined presale attempt. This upcoming announcement has fairly been received well. It not only instills confidence in FLOKI but also helps in the process of building trust in the community. The call to avoid the presale and instead go for the free airdrop at least to some level signals adherence to fair play and transparency, which might improve the long-term prospects of FLOKI. Floki: Price Forecast And Investment Outlook Looking further ahead, the price forecast of FLOKI seems quite promising. As per CoinCodex, the price may rise by approximately 227% by September 22, 2024, implying that it can go as high as $0.000489. The current feeling from technical indicators is Neutral, with neither buyers nor sellers in the upper hand driven by this bullish outlook. The fear and greed index reading of 34, which falls under the fear category, suggested that market sentiment remains at bay, probably due to the prevailing volatility. Related Reading: Stacks: New Developments Push STX Price 18% Higher – Details Over the past month, on average, FLOKI has been green 30%, which does not bode well for buyer interest. There have been truly a lot of price swings, given the token’s 17% volatility rate. For investors, this is quite a potential buying opportunity; however, it is not risk-free. It is very important to keep an eye on market conditions and overall sentiment before investment decisions can be made.

32783073,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637557,1724491857,"Bitcoin Price Surges Above $64,000 — Here’s The Resistance Level To Watch","The Bitcoin price performance has been uninspiring in the past week, mirroring the broader cryptocurrency market climate. However, the premier cryptocurrency seems to be ending the week on a high note following an unexpected Friday rally. The price of BTC appears to have received a breath of fresh air following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech, finding its way above the $64,000 mark — again — with an almost 7% surge. The question now is — how far can the Bitcoin price climb? Here’s Why $66,250 Is A Crucial Level For BTC Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to the X platform to share an interesting prognosis for the Bitcoin price over the next few days. The relevant indicator here is the Glassnode “UTXO Realized Price Distribution” (URPD) metric, which monitors the amount of a particular cryptocurrency that was purchased at a given price level. Related Reading: Is A Bitcoin (BTC) Negative Correlation With Stocks A Bullish Signal? Analyst Reveals Typically, the likelihood for a price level to act as an on-chain support or resistance zone depends on the number of coins that have their cost basis at the specific level. For context, the cost basis of an investor refers to the original price (including the transaction fees) at which they acquired a coin or token. Price levels beneath the current spot value with substantial buying activity will likely act as support zones. On the other hand, levels above the current price could prove to be significant resistance areas. The chart below depicts the distribution of Bitcoin at different price levels surrounding the recent spot price of the coin. Based on data from the highlighted chart, $64,045 and $66,250 seem to be the next crucial resistance levels to watch. While it appears that the Bitcoin price has flipped the $64,045 resistance wall, the $66,250 zone remains to be breached. According to data from Glassnode, nearly 382,000 coins were moved within the $66,250 price area. The last time BTC climbed above the $66,250 level, it traveled as high as the $70,000 mark before it encountered some resistance. It would be interesting to see how far the price of the premier cryptocurrency would go this time, especially considering that there is no major resistance wall above the $66,250 area based on the URPD indicator. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin is around the $64,000 mark, reflecting an almost 7% increase in the past 24 hours. This single-day performance has also shown on the weekly timeframe, with the flagship cryptocurrency climbing by nearly 10% in the past week.

Daily mining revenue averages dropped 12% to approximately $27.4 million this month, a metric we advise caution in over-indexing. Transfer volumes from miners to exchanges fell 21% over the past 30 days, suggesting stabilization from miners after their post-halving selling increased significantly in June and July. Bitcoin network activity stayed robust with an 83% surge in Ordinals inscriptions, while funding costs for Bitcoin futures dropped, reflecting a risk appetite seen in earlier market recoveries. Please note that VanEck has exposure to bitcoin. Our mid-August 2024 ChainCheck provides insight into Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) mixed on-chain signals and highlights notable off-chain developments. Over the past 30 days, we have observed Bitcoin's market resilience amid U.S. election season volatility and innovative shifts in the mining industry. Some takeaways for Mid-July - Mid-August: Bitcoin's Price Action Market sentiment: At $59,052, bitcoin's 7-day moving average (7 DMA) is down 9% over the past 30 days. Bitcoin surged in late July, outperforming the SPX and NDX, fueled by Donald Trump's rising poll numbers after the assassination attempt and optimism over the RNC's 2024 platform-the first U.S. party platform to endorse crypto with explicit, positive policies. However, this enthusiasm ended abruptly in early August, which saw bitcoin prices briefly dipping into the upper $40,000s amid one of the worst stock market selloffs since the COVID pandemic. Importantly, the selloff was not catalyzed by the crypto markets but by the unwinding of the Japanese Yen carry trade, which saw hundreds of millions of dollars of loan liquidations caused by a meager 0.25% interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan-if anything, highlighting the frailty of global financial markets and underscoring the case for hard money assets and commodities like bitcoin and gold. On balance, investor sentiment appears neutral to us. Bitcoin dominance: Interestingly, as illustrated by rising Bitcoin dominance (+4% MoM), Bitcoin benefits from optimism around electing a pro-crypto administration as a hedge against it. In the past 30 days, bitcoin dominance made multi-year highs not seen since April 2021. While the entire digital assets' ecosystem would benefit from more crypto-friendly regulators, Bitcoin is uniquely positioned to outperform the rest of the crypto market if a more crypto-hostile administration is elected, thanks to regulatory clarity around its status as a commodity. Regional trading: Asia hours: BTC's 7 DMA price fell 4% this month during Asian trading hours. U.S. hours: 7 DMA prices fell 6% this month as Trump odds fell. EU hours: The MoM change in BTC's 7 DMA price increased 1% among European traders this month, possibly due to them adding during selloffs in the larger Asian and American markets. Regional Trading MoM Change (%) YoY Change (%) Asia Hours Price Change MoM ($) -4 -9 US hours Price Change MoM ($) -6 -14 EU hours Price Change MoM ($) 1 2 Source: Glassnode, as of 8/19/24. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Funding rates: Over the past 30 days, the 7 DMA annualized cost of funding Bitcoin futures has dropped from ~11.6% to ~8.8% for a relative decline of ~24%. These levels indicate a risk appetite similar to those seen during market recoveries following 20%+ BTC price drops in early May and July of this year.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Bitcoin's Network Activity, Adoption, and Fees Daily transactions: Average daily transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain dropped 11% from their all-time highs set last month. However, this figure still rests at the 99thpercentile of all-time history, indicating sustained network adoption. Ordinals inscriptions: Curiously, Ordinals inscription transactions increased 83% after months of decline. While the metric is still down 80% YoY, this month's surge in activity is a welcome change for Ordinals ecosystem artists, developers, and users. We believe activity may be picking up amid cautious optimism particular to Bitcoin ecosystem dominance. Total transfer volume: Transfer volumes were down 14% for the month. After adjusting for 9% price declines, this number was essentially flat in the 85thpercentile. Average transaction fees: Average transaction fees dropped 44% to $0.79 this month, down 17% year-over-year, despite increased daily transactions. This decline is driven by Bitcoin's hash rate reaching new highs in 2024 and reduced network congestion. Fees have been decreasing since their June spike, where they peaked at ~$50 per transaction due to a surge in unconfirmed transactions, reportedly linked to OKX's wallet sorting. Concurrently, Bitcoin's difficulty adjusted to a record high level at the start of August, with further increases expected in the next adjustment anticipated on August 28th. Bitcoin Market Health and Profitability Percent of addresses in profit: The weekly average of Bitcoin addresses in profit declined 9% over the past 30 days, reducing the total to 84% and representing the 72nd percentile of the metric's all-time history. Despite the pain for short-term investors, we remind newcomers to the asset class that this drawdown is well within the bounds of a typical bull market retracement. Net unrealized profit/loss: This ratio dropped 1% to an average of 0.47 this month, hovering just below the 'Optimism - Anxiety' and 'Belief - Denial' sentiment line drawn at 0.50. This week's reading reinforces the neutral sentiment noted earlier, as this metric has remained close to this line since late June. Bitcoin Miners Total daily BTC miner revenues: Daily mining revenue averages dropped 12% to approximately $27.4 million this month, a metric we advise caution in over-indexing. While bitcoin mining revenues have faced challenges due to post-halving block reward reductions and low network fees, many publicly traded bitcoin miners in the MarketVector Digital Asset Equity Index (MVDAPP) are outperforming this year by capitalizing on opportunities in AI and high-performance cloud computing. For instance, miners like Core Scientific (CORZ) and Hut 8 (HUT) are reallocating power capacity to meet the growing demand for AI/HPC infrastructure. Early indications suggest that AI/HPC could deliver significantly higher margins per megawatt than traditional bitcoin mining, offering a compelling avenue for miners to diversify their revenue streams. We are closely monitoring this trend and have published in-depth research on our updated thesis for bitcoin miners, which can be accessed here: Bitcoin Miners' AI Arbitrage Play to Boost Revenue . Transfer volume from miners to exchanges ((USD)): Transfer volumes from miners to exchanges fell 21% over the past 30 days, suggesting stabilization from miners after their post-halving selling increased significantly in June and July. We believe some miners' strong equities performance on the back of their emerging AI/HPC story may contribute to this month's increased 'HODL' strategy, in which bitcoin miners keep their bitcoin in anticipation of monetizing it at higher future values. Chart of the Month: Bitcoin Miner Selloffs Hit New Lows as Halving Pressure Eases Source: Glassnode, VanEck research as of 8/19/24. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Notes: Net unrealized profit/loss ratio (NUPL) can be calculated by subtracting the realized market cap from the market cap and dividing the result by the market cap. When a high percentage of Bitcoin's market cap consists of unrealized profits, it can be interpreted that investors are greedy. Background reading here .

Index performance is not representative of fund performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Investments in digital assets and Web3 companies are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk. These risks include, but are not limited to: the technology is new and many of its uses may be untested; intense competition; slow adoption rates and the potential for product obsolescence; volatility and limited liquidity, including but not limited to, inability to liquidate a position; loss or destruction of key(s) to access accounts or the blockchain; reliance on digital wallets; reliance on unregulated markets and exchanges; reliance on the internet; cybersecurity risks; and the lack of regulation and the potential for new laws and regulation that may be difficult to predict. Moreover, the extent to which Web3 companies or digital assets utilize blockchain technology may vary, and it is possible that even widespread adoption of blockchain technology may not result in a material increase in the value of such companies or digital assets. Digital asset prices are highly volatile, and the value of digital assets, and Web3 companies, can rise or fall dramatically and quickly. If their value goes down, there's no guarantee that it will rise again. As a result, there is a significant risk of loss of your entire principal investment.

This unexpected news has fueled Bitcoin’s recent volatility, with prices swinging unpredictably in the past weeks. Related Reading: Investors Buying Bitcoin (BTC) Over Ethereum (ETH): Key Data Reveals Crucial on-chain data from CryptoQuant is providing a glimmer of optimism. According to the data, traders are positioning for further price appreciation. As the market digests the Fed’s new stance, all eyes are on Bitcoin to see if this could mark the beginning of a new bullish phase. Bitcoin Data Showing Market Optimism Bitcoin is trading above $63,000 and gaining momentum as it prepares to break past the critical $65,000 mark. On-chain data from CryptoQuant reveals growing market optimism, highlighting a significant trend that could drive prices higher. Specifically, Bitcoin exchange reserves on centralized exchanges have plummeted to an all-time low. Since the end of July, the supply of BTC on exchanges has decreased from over 2.75 million to approximately 2.67 million, representing a 3% drop in just 30 days. This decline indicates that less BTC is available for trading on exchanges, which could create a supply shock, a situation where demand outstrips supply, leading to a potential price surge. As Bitcoin’s availability on exchanges diminishes, the likelihood of a price increase grows. With Bitcoin starting to gain strength, the market is closely monitoring this trend, potentially pushing Bitcoin into new bullish territory. BTC Price Action: $65,000 Next? After two weeks of volatility and consolidation, Bitcoin is currently trading at $64,100 at the time of writing, holding above the crucial daily 200 Moving Average (MA). This level is essential for bulls to maintain the uptrend in a higher time frame. For the price to break past the $65,000 mark, it must confirm its bullish structure by holding above the $57,500 level. Ideally, staying above the daily 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which sits at $59,538, is preferable. Related Reading: Bitcoin Analyst Expects Bulls To Break $74,000 Within Two Months, History Favors BTC In Q4 2024 These levels are vital for establishing continued upward momentum.

32778540,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637538,1724477448,Solana Eyes Price Surge To $220: Breaking Through This Resistance Is The Key,"Solana (SOL), currently positioned as the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is mirroring Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent pattern of recovery, exhibiting a positive trajectory over the past couple of weeks. Friday’s recent price spike comes on the heels of positive macroeconomic developments from the US Federal Reserve (Fed), which have had a positive impact on the broader cryptocurrency market. 7% Weekly Uptick Amid Economic News In the last 24-hour window, SOL has surged by nearly 4%, showcasing a 7% uptick over the past week. This rebound comes after SOL plummeted to the $110 mark on August 5, marked by overall market turbulence triggered by adverse economic news impacting risk assets. Contrary to the negative economic backdrop previously witnessed, the recent scenario has taken a turn for the better following a noteworthy statement by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaches $62,000: Market Reacts To Powell’s Speech In a speech delivered earlier today, Powell hinted at the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the central bank in September. While specifics regarding the magnitude of this move were not explicitly disclosed, Powell emphasized the Fed’s readiness to adjust policies to safeguard the job market from further deterioration and to ensure a smooth economic transition. “The time has come for policy to adjust,” remarked Powell during the Kansas City Fed’s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. He emphasized the clarity of the direction for policy adjustments, highlighting that the timing and scale of rate cuts would hinge on incoming data, evolving economic forecasts, and risk evaluations. Solana Price Projection The market response to Powell’s statements has been palpable, with Bitcoin surging to the $63,000 mark at the time of reporting. Additionally, Ethereum (ETH) has seen a 4.4% upsurge to reach the $2,730 level, a height not observed since the end of July. Related Reading: Cardano Investors React To 14% ADA Price Surge To $0.37 In addition, a recent observation from crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests that Solana may be forming an Adam & Eve pattern, hinting at a potential surge towards $164 if SOL manages to breach this resistance level. In the event of a successful breakthrough, a substantial 33% increase towards $220 could be on the horizon. Should this projection materialize, SOL’s price would fall just shy of its previous all-time high of $259 recorded during the 2021 bull run, which peaked in November of that year. This expected spike would also put SOL well above its annual high of $210, which was reached five months ago. In the near term, however, the SOL price must first overcome the $151 resistance wall that has prevented the token from moving higher since August 11. Should the price break through this level, it would favorably position the token to potentially retest and consolidate above its next major resistance at the $161 zone.

32777461,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637547,1724473856,"Analyst Predicts 2,200% Explosion Will Send Cardano To $8, Here’s When","Cardano has gotten a lot of bullish predictions lately, especially in relation to the much-anticipated Chang upgrade. The upgrade is one of the most important upgrades for the network in a while, and this has triggered a wave of optimism among supporters. Amid this, another bullish prediction has been presented by crypto analyst Alan Santana, who predicts a significant rally for the altcoin’s price that would send it to new all-time high prices. Where Cardano Is In This Cycle In the last three years, the Cardano price has seen various waves of bullish and bearish cycles, and unfortunately, the bears look to have won out. This began after the ADA price hit its current all-time high price of $3.10 in 2021, and since then, it has been mainly down-only. While this would usually scare off investors, crypto analyst Alan Santana points it out in his bullish analysis. Related Reading: The Shiba Inu Shibarium Suffers 97.6% Crash In Active Accounts, What’s Going On? According to the crypto analyst, the period when the Cardano price hit a new all-time high and 2023 when the price began moving upward, it showed that the altcoin was in a bear market. However, this was followed by a consolidation phase, which lasted from the beginning of 2023 to the end of 2023. Once the consolidation period was done, the ADA price began to see an upside at the start of 2024. This saw its price go from as low as $0.24 to as high as $0.79. This phase, Santana refers to as the “initial bullish breakout.” Now, the reason this phase is important is it is what the analyst refers to as the “entree or appetizer before the major bull-market.” This means that is the analyst is right, then this initial breakout is only a preview of what’s to come. The decline that followed the local peak of $0.79 has been a source of worry for Cardano investors as the altcoin lost around 50% of its value since then. However, the crypto analyst calls this a “minor correction” which wouldn’t matter much when the bull cycle rolls around. How High Can The ADA Price Go? From the analysis, Santana seems to expect the Cardano price to bottom somewhere around $0.22. Soon after, a bounce is expected to follow the decline, pushing the price even higher. From here, the targets come in, both for the short and long term. Related Reading: This Triangle Pattern Triggered In 2021 Suggests XRP Price Will Surge 5,000% To $32 Short-term targets include a 284.5% increase to $1.36, and a 475.39% increase to $2. Over the long term though, the crypto analyst expects much more explosive rallies for the ADA price. Two in particular stand out: One is a 1,272.18% increase to a new all-time high of $4.8. While the most notable rally is a 2,200% increase that would put the price at $8.

Zeberg, who forecasted a rise to $95,000-$100,000 in December 2022, revised his prediction based on his Business Cycle Model. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready to Soar? Key Indicators Signal Potential $72K Target Bitcoin On The Verge Of A Breakout? Despite a generally bearish sentiment in late 2022, Zeberg maintained his optimistic outlook, which he still holds today. He pointed out that while many predicted an “imminent crash,” the market bottomed out in October 2022, setting the stage for the potential rally he now anticipates. In a post uploaded today on X, Zeberg reminded his followers of his earlier predictions, highlighting that he was bullish on Bitcoin even when others were not. He has adjusted his targets upwards, aligning his forecast with what he sees as “developing euphoria” in the US markets. Although he did not specify a timeline for Bitcoin to reach these new highs, Zeberg remains confident in his outlook, even while acknowledging that a severe recession, which he predicts will be worse than the one in 1929, is on the horizon.

Another prominent crypto analyst, Crypto Jelle on X, recently shared a similarly optimistic outlook. According to Crypto Jelle, Bitcoin’s price could reach as high as $180,000. He pointed to a bullish megaphone pattern forming over the past six months as a key indicator of this potential price target. Crypto Jelle noted that the pattern’s target remains intact, and he believes that the fourth quarter of this year could bring Bitcoin much closer to this target. After 6 months of consolidation, this bullish megaphone still has a target of $180,000. Have a funny feeling Q4 will get us a lot closer to that target. Hold on tight, and enjoy the ride. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/i0Kc8vCv3n — Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) August 23, 2024 Zeberg’s and Crypto Jelle’s predictions come when BTC is slowly recovering, reclaiming the $61,000 to trade for $61,484 at the time of writing. Regardless of the sluggishness in price recovery, Zeberg and Jelle remain convinced that Bitcoin is poised for substantial gains. However, Zeberg also cautioned investors that while the market may be heading towards a significant top, a major downturn is also likely.

32772653,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637546,1724457655,"Crypto Analyst Predicts 42,263% Breakout For XRP Price To $280, Here’s The Roadmap","A crypto analyst is predicting a massive price breakout for the XRP price, the native token of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Despite XRP’s sluggish price performance, the analyst believes that this cryptocurrency could soar as high as 42,263%, potentially hitting an ambitious price target of $280 this bullish cycle. Roadmap To XRP’s $280 Price Increase In an X (formerly Twitter) post on August 22, crypto analyst, Javon Marks expressed his optimistic projections for XRP, highlighting critical points where the cryptocurrency is most likely to experience a significant upward momentum. Sharing a historical price chart illustrating XRP’s price movements from 2014 to 2024, Marks outlined a unique triangle pattern which formed just before a bullish breakout in the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Cardano Investors React To 14% ADA Price Surge To $0.37 Based on the chart’s data, the XRP price formed a triangle pattern between 2014 and 2017, which led to its dramatic surge to an all-time high of $3.84 in 2018. Marks has identified that this triangle pattern has reemerged in XRP’s chart from 2018 to 2024. As a result, the analyst forecasts that XRP is on track to witness a 42,263% surge, potentially propelling its price to an ambitious target of $262.23. Given XRP’s current price of $0.59, this projected 42,263% increase would bring the cryptocurrency’s price to around $253.15. In his post, Marks notes that XRP was right at or near the point of a bullish breakout. He predicted that if XRP’s price increases by about 3% to 4% from its current price level, it could trigger the anticipated breakout. While the analyst remains optimistic about XRP’s future outlook, he also pointed out that the cryptocurrency has been stuck in a triangle pattern for roughly 6 years (2,424 days). However, Marks has revealed that if XRP can successfully break out of this long term pattern, it could attract a significant amount of buying interest, potentially sparking a strong “bullish presence,” not seen since 2016 to 2017. Update On XRP Price Analysis The price of XRP has been on a seemingly never ending consolidation phase for the past few years, persistently trading around the $0.5 price mark. Following the conclusion of the almost four year long court battle between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), XRP witnessed a massive price surge which pushed it to trade above $0.6.

Although the cryptocurrency has seen a 6% price increase over the past week, XRP has continually failed to hold above the $0.6 level. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.598, witnessing a slight increase of about $0.23% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. A crypto analyst and XRP supporter identified as ‘XRP Captain’ has highlighted a new technical pattern observed on the 4-Hour (4H) price chart of XRP. The analyst has identified this pattern as a “bull flag,” predicting that if XRP can break out of this unique bull pattern, the price could rise to a target of $0.65.
