42395302,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaHAy,1419873780,How 2014 Became the Year of Multisig,"Will O'Brien is CEO and co-founder of BitGo, a bitcoin security company and pioneer in multi-signature technologies. In this article, he examines bitcoin security trends from the last year and looks ahead to what 2015 has in store.  2014 was a pivotal year in bitcoin security. Although the industry had a rough start to the year with the collapse of the largest bitcoin exchange, Mt Gox, trleading companies have made significant strides toward making the ecosystem more secure and ready to scale.  After experiencing incredible growth in 2013, in which the price of bitcoin grew from a low of $13.16 to a high of $1,165.89, the digital currency seemed poised for mainstream adoption at the beginning of 2014.  But all was not well at Mt Gox, the exchange with the largest trading volume in the world. By February, Mt Gox would file for bankruptcy citing the loss of 850,000 BTC.  The mainstream press pointed to Mt Gox’s demise as the end of bitcoin itself. How could a digital currency revolutionize the financial system if it can’t be secured properly? Fortunately, pioneering companies were already solving the challenges of security and new solutions began to roll out.  The year of multisig  Gavin Andresen, chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, made a proclamation during his State of Bitcoin address at the Bitcoin 2014 conference in Amsterdam. He said without hesitation: “This is the year of the multi-signature wallet.”  What is 'multisig'? Multisig is short for multi-signature, the digital equivalent of a safe deposit box.  A multisig bitcoin wallet uses P2SH (BIP16) and requires M-of-N keys (eg: two of three) to sign a transaction. The resulting address starts with a '3' instead of a '1', which is an easy way to tell whether you are using a multisig wallet or not.  The first multisig wallet was launched in August 2013 by BitGo and many bitcoin companies have embraced this new standard, including BitPay, Circle, Coinbase, CoinKite, Armory, and GreenAddress.  Heading into 2014, the predominant model for securing bitcoins was single-key cold storage, in which a private key is generated offline and then stored in a vault.  While this is a good approach to preventing digital theft of private keys, it has put the industry in a cold storage ice age, where bitcoins are locked away and companies deploy off-blockchain transaction systems that are susceptible to the same manipulation that occurred at Mt Gox.  Cold storage also presents the possibility of loss due to user error or backup failures, even if the threat of theft is reduced.  Multisig is the first foundational infrastructure technology that will make the bitcoin ecosystem safer. At the beginning of 2014, only 0.02% of all BTC were secured with multisig; that number is now more than 5%.  Over the past year, there was a 79-fold increase in daily multisig transactions. In November, we saw the first ever multisig exchange come online, when TeraExchange partnered with BitGo for on-blockchain collateral management for its regulated swaps execution facility.  While we still need more adoption of multisig as an industry, 2014 was a turning point in implementing a better security model.  Bitcoin security in 2015  2015 promises to be a year of continued innovation to improve bitcoin security. Developments are already being implemented at limited scale, but 2015 will be the year in which we see them become much more central to the industry.  Here are some of the top trends to expect based on the progress made in 2014:  HD wallets  HD stands for 'hierarchical deterministic', a technique for generating private keys introduced in BIP32.  In an HD wallet, a new address is used for every transaction to maintain financial privacy and prevent others from identifying connected transactions on the blockchain.  Transaction signing policies  Your bank account has limits on wire transfers that require a second approval and your credit card blocks transactions that trigger their fraud filters.  Bitcoin as a core technology has none of these, but wallet providers and exchanges have already begun rolling out treasury protections and transaction signing policies such as spending limits, multi-user approvals and recipient whitelists.  Hardware devices and trusted computing  Trezor launched the first hardware wallet in 2014 and now other companies are following suit with hardware key fobs and hardware security modules.  Trusted computing is also entering the bitcoin ecosystem through companies like Rivetz. Advancements in hardware security will make it nearly impossible for hackers to get access to private keys.  Moving from multisig to multi-institutional  Multisig wallets require M-of-N keys to sign a transaction. Multi-user wallets require M-of-N users to sign a transaction with their respective private keys.  Additionally, multi-institutional wallets require those keys to be distributed to more than one organization, so that there is no opportunity for insider theft or targeted attack at one institution.  Industry standards and APIs  Best practices for security have been introduced by the pioneers over the last two years. The time is ripe for industry standards and API platforms to emerge, so that the next generation of companies can build on the work of the last generation, rather than reinventing the wheel.  As the industry forms standards, we hope to see other parties including regulators, insurance underwriters and auditors coming to the table in a spirit of collaboration.

42377906,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCMP,1419870685,MegaBigPower: 2014 Was a Game Changer for Bitcoin Mining,"The bitcoin mining landscape was, perhaps, permanently shaped over the past year, as events both great and small made their marks on the industry.  2014 saw community uprisings against large hashrate contributors, growing amounts of capital flowing into the space, the expansion of mining into the remote corners of the planet and much, much more.  MegaBigPower  ’s Dave Carlson argues that the last year was a game changer that brought both risk and reward for those who decided to throw their hat in the mining ring.  Carlson operates a bitcoin mine out of Washington state and began establishing a franchisee mining initiative over the summer.  According to Carlson, 2014 saw dramatic change that has deep implications for the industry moving forward. This evolution has both benefits and costs, he says, and any enterprise that didn’t maintain a pragmatic stance and invest in infrastructure “is now suffering the consequences”.  He told CoinDesk:  “The promise of running magic money machines in your own home caught consumers' imaginations. The chance to grab quick profits enticed entrepreneurs and investors. Huge risks were taken. They were exciting times, but they were short lived.”  Carlson also speculated that 2015 could bring big changes to mining, saying that, at the end of day, the ecosystem may evolve but will always be governed by that one key metric: the price.  Big leap for tech  On the technology side, Carlson indicated that ASICs improved in both performance and design quality throughout 2014. He cited the work by companies in the hardware space today as a vast improvement over past generations of equipment, and predicted that this trend will continue.  “The first ASIC mining rigs were really community-designed hobby kits,” he said. “The new stuff coming out is more professional and much higher quality.”  ASIC developments followed established trends of technology growth in the past year, he added, explaining:  “We are watching bitcoin transaction-processing technology progress very rapidly through the same stages that data center servers have gone through.”  However, he noted that ASIC improvements won’t be that significant as we move into 2015. While certainly an improvement over previous generations, Carlson argued that any foreseeable performance enhancements will not result in a significant boost to the overall network hash rate.  Centralization remains an issue  The rise of the ASIC and the profitability shifts for mine operators has resulted in what can only be called the death of the retail bitcoin miner, according to Carlson.  “The market for retail miners has all but disappeared,” he explained. “The amount of power required to make a relevant amount of bitcoin has pretty much just left the larger operators who can run at scale using cheap power.”  Calling large mining pools a ""direct threat to bitcoin’s future"", Carlson said that the community should be as much against the existence of several large mining entities as they are about one huge one.  He said:  “Each and every investor, owner, entrepreneur or bitcoin enthusiast should be concerned that having two large pools and one 'Unknown' does not ensure the healthy future of the bitcoin ecosystem.”  What’s coming in 2015  Carlson sees the price as the determining factor for network growth in 2014, though he sees a steady rise playing out over the next year. At the same time, he didn’t rule out big changes if something unexpected redraws the lines in the industry.  He explained:  “As price fluctuates up and down, we will see the network size follow. If a new market dynamic causes significant reduction in BTC supply, or there's a significant increase in demand we will see prices move higher.”  Carlson is interested in seeing how transaction volumes change over the course of 2015, he said, explaining that mining pools in the space are evolving their business practices as the nature of transactions change.  “Large mining pools are already adjusting their thresholds to accept only paid transaction,” he said. “Soon they will begin to adjust those thresholds higher, requiring more pay for more critical transactions.”  Carlson suggested that sidechains may prove to be a potential source of future growth as well.  Overall, he pointed to the environment for existing mine operators as a strong one, and Carlson noted he looks forward a more “steady” pace in 2015.  “I'm really excited to see the market settling down,” Carlson said. “This gives an opportunity to clearly identify the economic expectations around securing capital for growth.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/29/megabigpower-2014-was-a-game-changer-for-bitcoin-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4aff38a86e3d1e4a55ce2647c65efe3fd988402e-1277x950.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377908,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCNf,1419864814,Russian Ministry Criticises Draft Bill Banning Bitcoin,"Russia's Ministry of Economic Development has criticised a proposed ban on ""cash equivalents"", according to a report.  The ministry said that legislation aimed at banning cash equivalents, including digital currencies like bitcoin, could have negative effects on retailers, telecom operators and banks.  Specifically, some provisions of the bill could create excessive restrictions and obligations, creating unreasonable costs for businesses, it said. The ministry therefore asked that the bill be reworked and resubmitted for further consideration.  The bill in question  was drafted earlier this year by the Russian Ministry of Finance, and would prevent the issuance of digital currencies and all operations involving digital currencies – effectively placing a ban on the fledgling technology.  In September, the finance ministry suggested that Russia could pass the proposed bill in the spring of 2015.  Blow to retailers  In its comments, which were reported by Russian news agency TASS, the Ministry of Economic Development said the proposed bill lacks precision, as it could potentially ban the use of all cash equivalents including gift cards and retailers' certificates.  The bill’s definition of what constitutes cash equivalents is ambiguous, the ministry said, adding that, while the bill would ban the use of unregulated digital currencies, or 'surrogate money', it could also affect other cash equivalents.  The ministry stated:  “Participants in public debate believe that the proposed definition, interpreted literally, would apply to any other cash equivalents, such as gift cards, retailers’ certificates and various bonuses used for promoting customer loyalty and attract clientele.”  The ministry concluded that this lack of clarity could create serious difficulties for companies’ marketing campaigns, which often involve some sort of cash equivalents as part of a wider loyalty programme. For example, major telecoms operators would be unable to offer bonus points, which are a popular marketing tool.  The ministry said the bill could cause more harm than good:  ""The proposed draft regulation act doesn’t solve any tasks assigned, but only serves to create legal barriers to the implementation of marketing programs of businesses and business development in general.""  The proposed bill can now either be reworked to reflect the Ministry of Economic Development's criticisms, or submitted it in its current state, but including the comments.  Bill a 'step backwards'  Russia’s National Payments Council has also said the definition used in the draft bill would outlaw bonuses to consumers who prefer to pay using their cards.  The move could undermine the payments market, the council said, effectively throwing it “a few years into the past” and potentially leading to a fall in non-cash payments for goods and services.  Several companies, including major mobile carriers Megafon and MTS, have also voiced their concerns about the draft bill.  In addition, WebMoney development director Peter Darakhvelidze has said that, since Russia could soon start experiencing difficulties in accessing the global financial system, the government should not try to ban innovative financial solutions.  Support for cryptocurrencies  This is not the first time Russia’s financial sector has spoken out in favour of digital currency technology.  In July, the Bank of Russia argued that digital currencies should not be rejected. Deputy chairman Georgy Luntovsky said that, while there was evidence of bitcoin use in criminal circles, the bank would not seek “harsh measures” against its use.  German Gref, the president of state-owned Sberbank, currently the largest bank in Russia and Eastern Europe, also spoke out in favour of digital currency technology.  In an interview conducted at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Gref described digital currencies as a “very interesting global experiment” that breaks the paradigm of currency issuance.  An outright ban of bitcoin would be a colossal mistake, he said, arguing for more research into the phenomenon and ""proper"" regulation.

42377905,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCJt,1419856610,Markets Weekly: 2014 Closes on Bearish Note for Bitcoin,"The bitcoin price has been in the doldrums in the last week, closing out a month of persistent losses. It's now trading at the lowest levels of the year.  Bitcoin opened the week at $330.67 and closed at $316.80, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. That represented a loss of $13.87 in the bitcoin price over the last seven days, or 4.2%.  Over the week, the price hit a high of $335.88 on the 23rd December, only to fall to a low of $312.40 four days later. That was a drop of some $23.  The bitcoin price has not been kind to bulls this month. While it was trading in the high-$300s – even breaking the $400 mark at one point – in November, the start of December saw a period of sustained downward pressure on BTC/USD.  Trading volumes offer little optimism. Volumes have fallen sharply across the board this week, with the total amount of bitcoins changing hands down by 24% compared to the previous week, according to data from Bitcoinity. The Christmas holidays this week surely deepened the decline.  Big Chinese exchanges OKCoin and BTC China showed drops of 18% and 17% respectively. Exchanges elsewhere showed far steeper plunges, with Bitstamp showing a decrease in trading volume of 56% and Bitfinex showing a 54% drop.  Pressure from tax-loss selling  One market observer attributed December's plummeting price to widespread tax-reduction measures. In December, investors in the US securities markets often offload stocks or other assets that have performed poorly at a loss in order to avoid paying short-term capital gains taxes. The practice influences the markets so greatly that trading strategies have been devised around these fluctuations.  It's tax-loss selling that could be driving the bitcoin price down in December, says Harry Yeh, managing partner at digital currency fund Binary Financial. Punters who speculated on bitcoin and lost have the option of cutting their losses by selling in December, before the new tax season starts.  With bitcoin now trading in the low $300s, Yeh said it has bottomed out and that is poised for a rebound in the coming year.  One catalyst that could give a bitcoin rebound impetus is the rise of derivatives, Yeh said.  As futures contracts become more widespread in the cryptocurrency world, payment processors, miners and speculators gain the ability to hedge their bitcoin holdings. This should make them more comfortable holding larger quantities of bitcoin, according to Yeh.  The Nasdaq's Martin Tillier broadly agrees. In his outlook for bitcoin in 2015, he also pointed to holding power as the main driver for a rising bitcoin price.  Hope for the new year  For Tillier, the big merchants who have announced that they will accept bitcoin payments this year have been putting selling pressure on the price because they don't hold on to assets in bitcoin. Instead, they immediately convert any bitcoin holdings to fiat currency.  In the coming year, some of these merchants will start to hold bitcoin instead of cashing out instantly. As merchants begin to hold bitcoin and transact with one another in the digital currency, demand for bitcoin will creep up again, boosting the price, Tillier argued.  Looking at the larger macro factors, there's always the possibility that a fiat currency will lose its value so quickly that bitcoin begins to look like a safe haven.  The Russian ruble for example has lost about a third of its value against the US dollar this year. Trading volumes in the BTC/Ruble currency pair have enjoyed growing volumes this year on both the BTC-e exchange and the Local Bitcoins peer-to-peer marketplace, according to data from Bitcoin Charts.  As bitcoin tests new lows at the end of 2014, it seems the bears have won this year. Bitcoin bulls must hope that the new year offers fresh hope for a lift in prices.

42377921,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCe1,1419852574,Gregory Maxwell: How I Went From Bitcoin Skeptic to Core Developer,"Bitcoin holds a lot of promise as a decentralized currency, but there are many technical issues to be tackled as adoption increases.  No one knows this better than core developer Gregory Maxwell, who has been contributing to bitcoin’s software since the early days.  A long time open-source and cryptography advocate, Maxwell was an early contributor to Wikipedia and worked for the Mozilla Foundation. He is now a co-founder of Blockstream, which has raised $21m with ambitious plans to push forward the development of bitcoin to better secure its future.  Maxwell recently talked to CoinDesk at the Future of Money Summit about his early disdain for the idea of digital currency, how he plans to create more core developers and the technical issues Blockstream intends to take on.  From skeptic to believer  Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the concept of bitcoin on a cryptography mailing list back in 2008. Like many members of that list, Maxwell was initially skeptical of a digital currency not requiring third party trust.  He told CoinDesk:  “When bitcoin first came out, I was on the cryptography mailing list. When it happened, I sort of laughed. Because I had already proven that decentralized consensus was impossible.”  Much of his doubt came from the fact Maxwell was an early supporter of Wikipedia, becoming a contributor to the online encyclopedia in late 2004. He realized during those formative years working on Wikipedia that complete decentralization is hard to pull off.  “Traditional consensus systems have needed an admissions control system,” Maxwell said, referring to the fact that Wikipedia needed gateways to provide highly accurate information to visitors.  “Bitcoin gets around [admissions control] with the proof-of-work stuff. I thought, this is cool. Maybe some people will use it for anti-spam, but it can’t be secure,” he said.  Later on in 2009, Maxwell noticed bitcoin was still around. He then read over the source code.  He said:  “I started contributing to the bitcoin software basically right after paying attention to it and learning how it worked. Seeing, 'oh, this isn’t impossible'.”  After that, he started sending in patches to Sourceforge, the precursor to GitHub where bitcoin's codebase was originally stored.  The origins of Blockstream  According to Maxwell, Blockstream was born out of the sheer amount of work that needs to be done developing bitcoin’s core software. “On the technical side, there is no end to interesting technical problems,” he said.  Sidechains  , which allow bitcoin to move to an alternative blockchain for additional uses and features, and also allow experimentation with the technology, are a key aspect the company is focusing on.  A proof-of-concept whitepaper on sidechains was released in October that caused much buzz in the community for its potential to reshape the digital currency ecosystem.  Prior to this, Maxwell said, the concept of one-way pegged sidechains had long been discussed. However, this idea gained little traction because users could end up with worthless coins if a proposed sidechain project didn’t work out.  “The problem with a one-way peg is that if it turns out to be a lemon, you’re stuck. You can’t get out, you can’t go back,” Maxwell explained.  Blockstream, though, found a way to perform a reciprocal peg.  “I realized how to go in the other direction – something that could reasonably go back and plausibly have good security. Every other proposal before then just wouldn’t work or couldn’t be secure.”  Funding bitcoin development overall is also a part of Blockstream’s mission. There are few companies today working on deep infrastructure issues which will help bitcoin scale.  Maxwell said:  “It’s very difficult to fund infrastructure development. Particularly forward-looking, longer-term things.”  Maxwell conceded that sidechains, for example, is a complex project. “It’s not a small piece of engineering to go build this,” he said. However, Blockstream will have dedicated developers who will devote time to working out the specific complexities of sidechains, Maxwell assured.  Creating core developers  Blockstream's Adam Back and Austin Hill have both talked about the need to accelerate the development of bitcoin technology, yet there simply are not enough core coders available right now.  One of Maxwell’s roles at Blockstream is the creation of new talent to help drive bitcoin development. “The real problem is just expanding the base of people who can do this stuff,” he said.  He explained:  “We’re going to make more core developers. My goal in hiring has not been to sort of fight over the meager scraps of stuff that’s available.”  Maxwell described development work on bitcoin as “mission critical.” Blockstream also aims to offer thought leadership within the industry to voice opinions on how bitcoin can remain a stable and secure technology.  “I think [bitcoin is] easier for the folks at Blockstream to talk about. Because we’ve been involved in this stuff, we are the biggest technical guns in the bitcoin space,” he said.  November's $21m funding round, led by Reid Hoffman, Khosla Ventures and Real Ventures, among many others, was completed with long-term bitcoin development as a focus.  “[Development] is some of the stuff that we told our investors about. It takes money to go and do that. It does not have a short-term immediate payoff, it’s a long-term payoff,” said Maxwell.  Addressing centralization concerns  Many in the bitcoin community are concerned the ethos of bitcoin’s decentralization is eroding.  They point to off-chain transactions, regulatory scrutiny and companies like Blockstream employing many bitcoin core developers as problematic.  Maxwell stressed that while the company would generate new bitcoin core developers, this doesn’t mean that they will have to stay at the company permanently.  “If we manufacture someone who is making this stuff, they are not bound to Blockstream forever,” he said.  He added:  “From one perspective, it shouldn’t matter. Because if having a bunch of people, [or] control over a bunch of people, working on the reference client is bad, then we’re already in trouble.""  Problems with decentralization as bitcoin grows are not going to diminish either, according to Maxwell: “There’s an inherent tradeoff between scale and decentralization when you talk about transactions on the network.”  The problem, he said, is that as bitcoin transaction volume increases, larger companies will likely be the only ones running bitcoin nodes because of the inherent cost.  He pointed out:  “You’d need a lot of bandwidth, on the order of a gigabit connection. It would work. The problem is that it wouldn’t be very decentralized, because who is going to run a node?”  Maxwell identified BitPay, Coinbase, Bitfinex and Bitstamp as the few large bitcoin companies that will likely be running nodes if transaction volume grows.  This brought the core developer back to why sidechains, in the end, will be critically important to bitcoin. Figuring out how to properly scale bitcoin will require a lot of testing.  “The tradeoff isn’t a constant. We can do some things where you can get some scale without hurting decentralization. But that requires some experimentation,” he said.

42377924,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCgX,1419844915,6 Weird and Wonderful Bitcoin Events of 2014,"It's been a roller coaster year in bitcoin, and not just for the price.  While companies like Circle ventured to make bitcoin a serious contender in mainstream finance, there were many events that highlighted the not-so-serious side of the currency. Here are six of the best.  Poop mail  Whoever said that bitcoin couldn't buy you things? Alongside Xbox credits, university tuition and craft beer, 2014 was the year that the digital currency first bought you a parcel full of crap.  Founded in October, Shitexpress is a service that mails a tupperware container of horse manure with a personalised message on your behalf (see Motherboard journalist Jason Koebler's I hate your guts).  In its first 30 days, the company made over $10,000.  On the Shitexpress blog, CEO 'Peter' said he had received orders from over 30 different countries and plans to expand his ""killer app"".  It's raining coin  While the sex industry took slow, tentative steps into the realm of bitcoin in 2014, one strip club in Tampa, Florida, put the digital currency centre stage.  2001 Odyssey's 'Make it Rain' machine – a $1 bill dispenser that 'rains' money onto the club's performers – added bitcoin payments via payment processor BitPay in April.  Members watching the space-themed club's livestream can send $50- or $100-worth of the digital currency raining over its dancers, the DJ or even the club's manager.  To celebrate their flurry of generosity, punters even get a 'shout out' from the DJ and a 'thunder rumble' sound effect to boot.  Blockchain wedding  This year, two bitcoin fans decided to take their love for the cryptocurrency (and each other) to the next level.  Joyce and David Mondrus exchanged vows at the world's first 'blockchain wedding' at Disneyland, Florida on 5th August.  The event, officiated by none other than author and libertarian Jeffrey Tucker, was part of the Coins in the Kingdom conference, a perfect setting for the so-called ""magic Internet money"".  The couple stood beside a bitcoin ATM and guests could verify their 0.1 BTC transaction via a QR code, while tucking into their computer-shaped cake.  “For better or worse, ’til death do us part, because the blockchain is forever,” the transaction's metadata reads.  Hand-y wallet  In a year marred by hacks, scams and losses, the issue of wallet security was more relevant than ever.  During a ‘biohacking’ event in the Netherlands, one man, Martijn Wismeijer (also known as Mr Bitcoin), took matters into his own hands, rather literally.  With the help of a body-modification specialist, two NFC-enabled chips capable of storing bitcoin private key data were injected into the flesh between Wismeijer's thumb and index finger.    Speaking to CoinDesk, the entrepreneur said he has so far experimented with storing litecoin, darkcoin, dogecoin and bitcoin on the tiny devices, which can hold up to 888 bytes of data each (around 26 different mini private keys).      “As long as you can export your private key, you can write that into your hands,"" he said.    Wow, such Nascar  2014 also witnessed the rise of the alts. While projects like Ripple, Stellar and litecoin gained ground, an unlikely meme-based currency also caught on: dogecoin.  What started as a joke soon snowballed into an active community known for its charitable giving and non-sensical grammar.  Campaigns included the Doge4Water drive, which raised $50,000 to build Kenyan water wells, and the $30,000 campaign to send Jamaica's bobsleigh team to the Winter Olympics, Cool Runnings-style.  But, most notable was the dogecoin community's Nascar sponsorship, which saw driver Josh Wise race with a Shiba Inu logo on his bonnet at the Talledega Superspeedway.  Chasing Dorian  The search to uncover the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto reached fever pitch this year.  Although researchers and casual users had tried and failed to track down the bitcoin's mysterious creator (or creators) using various methods before, Newsweek claimed it had succeeded.  The main giveaway? The phonebook. Yes, according to Newsweek, Satoshi Nakamoto – a notoriously secretive cryptographer – was not using a carefully constructed alias, but his real name.  Alas, not everyone was convinced by Newsweek's scoop, timed to relaunch its print edition, but it triggered a frenzy among journalists to reach Dorian.  Soon, news crews swarmed his LA home and, after his decision to take a 'free lunch' from an AP reporter in exchange for an interview, a farcical car chase took place with journalists in tow.
