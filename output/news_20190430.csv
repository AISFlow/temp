42402865,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddMpz,1556652088,Two Charged With Running 'Shadow Banking' Service for Crypto Exchanges,"The U.S. Department of Justice announced Tuesday that it has hit two individuals with bank fraud charges in connection to a system for depositing funds to cryptocurrency exchanges.  In a statement  , U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York alleged that Reginald Fowler of Arizona and Ravid Yosef, said to live in Tel Aviv, Israel, were part of a scheme that involved using bank accounts to move money into a series of unnamed cryptocurrency exchanges.  Court documents  released by the Justice Department purport that the alleged money services business operated between February and October 2018. During that period, prosecutors say, the two ""opened and used numerous bank accounts at financial institutions that were insured by the [FDIC],"" including one based in Manhattan.  Two of the bank accounts named in the court document are allegedly held under the name Global Trading Solutions LLC, one apiece from HSBC Bank USA and HSBC Securities USA/Pershing LLC.  That firm was previously identified in October as having done business with crypto exchange Bitfinex, which is being investigated along with stablecoin issuer Tether by the New York Attorney General's Office in a development that last week spilled into public view. Past reporting suggests that the corporate entity said to be involved is tied to Crypto Capital, a payment processing firm that has provided services to crypto exchange Bitfinex and others.  “Reginald Fowler and Ravid Yosef allegedly ran a shadow bank that processed hundreds of millions of dollars of unregulated transactions on behalf of numerous cryptocurrency exchanges,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a statement. ""Their organization allegedly skirted the anti-money laundering safeguards required of licensed institutions that ensure the U.S. financial system is not used for criminal purposes, and did so through lies and deceit.""  Fowler was charged with bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and and a count of operating an unlicensed money transmission business (along with a charge of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmission business), whereas Yosef, who has not been arrested at the time of announcement, was charged with bank fraud and conspiracy to do so.  According to the press statement, agents from the FBI's New York Money Laundering Investigations Squad and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) participated in the investigation.  Crypto Capital connection  While the court documents themselves don't directly state it, supplementary reporting suggests that Global Trading Solutions LLC is tied to licensed financial institution Global Trade Solutions AG. Global Trade Solutions is the parent company of Crypto Capital, a payment processor named in in the NY AG's investigation of Bitfinex and Tether, the company behind the USDT stablecoin. The firm is cited as parent company on Crypto Capital's website.  In addition to doing business with Bitfinex, Crypto Capital's website names among its customers the now-defunct QuadrigaCX and Coinapult, among others. According to the Wayback Machine, past customers include exchanges Kraken, BTCC and Bitt.  In a letter published by journalist Amy Castor, dated December of last year, Global Trade Solutions's Ivan Molina wrote that ""Global Trade Solutions AG and related entities are being denied banking services in the United States, Europe and other select international locations, as a result of certain AML and financial crimes investigations by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation and cooperative international law enforcements and/or regulatory agencies.""  ""Authorities investigating GTS and related entities have effectively frozen bank accounts and disabled traditional banking services as it relates to crypto currency and exchange services; in many instances ex parte without a warrant or court order,"" Molina stated, a possible reference to the timing in Tuesday's indictment which indicated that the funds in the HSBC accounts were seized in October.  He then outlines account seizures at HSBC in London, as well as similar actions occurring in the United States, moves that ""have resulted in bank accounts being frozen and blocked without warning or explanation, banking services terminated, and access to bank accounts denied.""  Molina included two links in his letter, one of which was to a story by crypto publication The Block that reported the use of Global Trading Solutions LLC's services for depositing funds to Bitfinex.  As reported last week, Bitfinex and Tether are accused of papering over an alleged $850 million loss using funds originally intended to provide backing for Tether's USDT stablecoin, a move that the AG's office alleged wasn't disclosed to the exchange's customers. Yet per the court filings, lawyers for Bitfinex and Tether told the AG's office that the funds aren't actually lost, but had been seized from Crypto Capital and are being held by authorities in the US, Poland and Portgual.  To date, neither Bitfinex or Tether have been charged with any crimes, and the two sides are set to meet in court in New York on Friday.  This story is actively developing and will be periodically updated with more information.  The superseding indictment can be found below:    u.s. v.

42402866,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddMp0,1556639239,Tether Lawyer Admits Stablecoin Now 74% Backed by Cash and Equivalents,"UPDATE (May 1, 2019, 01:40 UTC): Later Tuesday, New York Supreme Court Justice Joel Cohen ordered the NYAG's office to demonstrate to the court why the attorney general's initial Ex Parte order should not be canceled outright or at least modified to allow Bitfinex and Tether's employees to access a line of credit offered by Tether to Bitfinex. The NYAG must submit a response detailing its reasoning by May 6, 2019.      The USDT stablecoin is only about 74 percent backed by fiat equivalents as of April 30, says its issuer's general counsel.  Tether, the company behind USDT, holds about $2.1 billion in cash and short-term securities, wrote its general counsel Stuart Hoegner in an affidavit Tuesday. Hoegner is also general counsel to Bitfinex, a crypto exchange which shares executives and has overlapping owners with Tether.  The two companies are at the heart of allegations by the New York Attorney General, who says Bitfinex borrowed more than $600 million from Tether after losing as much as $850 million to a currency converter.  [embed width=""560"" height=""315""]https://www.youtube.com/embed/UjQjq1eWqCc[/embed]  Hoegner filed the affidavit to support an Order to Show Cause to vacate or modify the NYAG's ex parte order filed last week, and to stay the order, which would compel Bitfinex and Tether to produce certain documents by May 3.  Indeed, under a subheading labeled ""Tether Holders Are Not At Risk,"" Hoegner confirmed that USDT is no longer backed 100 percent by cash or liquid assets, saying:  ""As of the date [April 30] I am signing this affidavit, Tether has cash and cash equivalents (short term securities) on hand totaling approximately $2.1 billion, representing approximately 74 percent of the current outstanding tethers.""  According to Omni Explorer, a block explorer for Tether, there are approximately 2.8 billion USDT tokens issued as of press time.  Not fully backed  Another attorney representing Tether, Zoe Phillips of law firm Morgan Lewis, wrote in a memorandum of law in support of the defendants' order to show cause that Tether does not need to hold $1 for every USDT issued.  She wrote:  ""According to the Attorney General, the line of credit needed to be frozen because it improperly impairs the reserves Tether would use for redemptions. The Attorney General appears to believe that Tether must hold $1 in cash fiat currency for every dollar of tether. These allegations are wrong on multiple levels.""  The terms of Tether and Bitfinex's credit agreement were ""negotiated on an arm's length basis on commercially reasonable terms,"" she added, saying that each of the companies was represented by independent counsel.  However, as Bitfinex critic Bitfinex'ed noted on Twitter, the same individual – Giancarlo Devasini – signed both Tether and Bitfinex's agreements.  Hoegner echoed Phillips' claim that the agreements were negotiated independently, while also adding that Tether has noted on its website that its stablecoin is no longer 100 percent backed, citing media reports when the platform changed its stance.  Market protection  Hoegner wrote in his affidavit that the Bitfinex and Tether lending agreements were made ""for the protection of the virtual currency market,"" perhaps underscoring concerns that the two companies compose a significant part of the crypto market infrastructure.  ""Tether, and holders of tether, have a keen interest in ensuring that one of the dominant trading platforms of tethers has sufficient liquidity for normal operations,"" he wrote, addressing what possible benefits exist from the deal.  He added that any disruption to Bitfinex's operations could risk harming Tether as well.  Between December 2018 and April 29, 2019, an average of $566,066 in USDT has been redeemed, Phillips added, with the largest redemption in that period checking in at $24.2 million.

42402876,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddN0o,1556637022,Microsoft Outlook Hackers Stole Crypto Using Victims' Emails: Report,"Hackers who breached Microsoft Outlook have reportedly used the email service to steal cryptocurrency users' funds.  Motherboard reported Tuesday that hackers had managed to gain access to Microsoft customer support employee’s accounts in recent weeks, after which they were able to access non-corporate email accounts, including in Hotmail and MSN. Microsoft confirmed the breach to TechCrunch.  Since the attack, ""multiple victims"" have reported having cryptocurrencies stolen, Motherboard said.  One victim, named Jevon Ritmeester, posted on the Tweakers forum that his Kraken cryptocurrency exchange account had been hacked and that he lost around 1 bitcoin (worth about $5,260 at press time) as a result.  Ritmeester wrote that after visiting Kraken and finding his password no longer worked, he searched his emails in Outlook and found that several notifications of the changed login were in the trash. He further found that someone had enabled Outlook to automatically move any email mentioning Kraken to the trash and forward that message to a Gmail address, presumably owned by the hackers..  Ritmeester said he did not have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled on his Kraken account. Just last month, the exchange said it was introducing compulsory 2FA process to enhance users’ security.  Other users also said they had lost crypto via the Microsoft breach. One, going by the username ""Keats852,"" posted on Reddit earlier this month that he'd lost “25,000 in crypto” (currency not stated), also because hackers had accessed and deleted his emails.  Another Redditor said in the same thread that they had reported ""something major going on"" to Microsoft over the last two months, but had been ""ignored.""  Ritmeester told Motherboard that Microsoft is not taking the breach ""seriously"" and that he intends to file a police complaint over the issue.

HTC decentralized chief officer Phil Chen said at a recent event in Taipei that the company is preparing to release a second generation of its blockchain phone, the EXODUS, by the year's end, Taiwan News reported Sunday.  The HTC EXODUS 1 was officially released last October, after being first announced during CoinDesk’s Consensus 2018 event last May.  The phone includes a cryptocurrency wallet and also supports decentralized applications or dapps. Sales of the device have been in line with the company’s expectations, Chen reportedly told the event.  Rival blockchain phone maker, Israel-based Sirin Labs, on the other hand, recently axed a quarter of its workforce due to disappointing sales of its Finney phone.  According to DigiTimes, Chen indicated the second-gen device will sport extra features over the current model, saying:  “The new phone will extend its blockchain apps to include other areas such as browsing, messaging, and social media.”  The apps will further utilize peer-to-peer connections ""instead of passing through cloud or mainframe boards as done previously,” he added.  Earlier this month, Chen also launched a blockchain-focused venture capital fund worth $50 million, along with two partners. The fund, called Proof of Capital, aims to bring blockchain technology to the masses by investing in early-stage startups.  Proof of Capital has also partnered with HTC on its EXODUS line, stating it will work with the company “to define the standards and interactions for this new internet and bring mobile and hardware know-how for our portfolio companies.”  The EXODUS 1 was notably only available for purchase with bitcoin and ether at launch.

42402870,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddMuu,1556629235,Bitcoin Startup Unveils 'Thunder Bird' Lightning Code for IoT Devices,"Japanese startup Nayuta is releasing an in-progress lightning implementation with a compelling new focus: the internet of things (IoT).  As revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Nayuta is publishing the first lightning implementation geared specifically toward IoT, or networks of connected devices that feed data to one another. The idea behind Nayuta's release is that it connects to bitcoin's live network (as opposed to a test one), allowing transactions of real BTC.  To date, Nayuta's release represents the fourth lightning implementation to officially launch on bitcoin's mainnet so far, following software pushes from startups Acinq, Blockstream, and Lightning Labs.  Called Ptarmigan, the Japanese word for ""thunder bird,"" the name plays off the fact that the promising bitcoin technology it builds upon is named ""lightning.""  The startup view micropayments as a major element for the budding Internet of Things industry, which has attracted attention from many big name firms. Some of those companies are investing time and resources at the intersection of blockchain and IoT, and while there's not one clear direction for how the tech can be integrated into connected device networks, recent headlines make it clear that significant industries are getting involved.  The idea behind one aspect -- as demonstrated by Jaguar's IOTA experiment as well as work by startups like Nayuta, is that IoT devices will be capable of making small payments to one another. In the case of lightning, such micropayments could be conducted using bitcoin.  As Nayuta co-founder Kenichi Kurimoto explained to CoinDesk:  ""The lightning network has the following promising characteristics: (a) small transaction amounts, or ""micropayments"" (b) borderless and cross-domain payments (c) real-time payments (d) large transaction per second (TPS) potential. Especially the combination (a) & (b) has the potential to create a whole new market. Because humans do not want to make payment-action many times, it is required to link with other actions performed by many people or with some kind of autonomous actions.""  Nayuta partnered with a major electric Japanese company last year to put lightning payments to the test for recharging electric cars. But while this is also a vision shared by larger companies like Qualcomm Ventures, thus far, these ideas haven't taken off at a large scale, perhaps partly because bitcoin's micropayment technology is still under-developed.  But Nayuta is trying to put the idea to the test. Soon to follow is a device they call a lightning ""shield."" Arduino's are little computers used mostly by hobbyists to create robots or other technology. ""Shields"" add extra functionality, from motors for making things spin or better sound. a new type of technology that can be clipped onto an Arduino board.  ""It means dramatically increasing the number of people who can develop prototypes of IoT applications that use Lightning Network feature,"" Kurimoto said, adding:  ""IoT is one of the important Lightning Network application area, but no one knows what the killer-app is. In such situation, an increasing number of developers and prototyping trials are very important.""  But this one adds lightning functionality, or the ability for said device to send or receive small payments.  ""Our long-term goal is to make Ptarmigan the small-footprint lightning network software that operates on small hardware. This mainnet version experimentally implements an SPV wallet mode with which it operates on an independent node on Raspberry Pi Zero,"" Nayuta said in a press release.  ""SPV,"" which stands for simplified payment verification, is a small lightning node on the network that requires an end-user to download less data.

42402872,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddMvt,1556625610,JPMorgan Exec Joins Blockchain Gold-Trading Firm Tradewind as CEO,"Tradewind, a blockchain-powered marketplace for precious metals, has hired a senior executive from JPMorgan to be the startup's first-ever CEO.  Michael Albanese, most recently the global head of collateral management at the New York-based megabank, has over 20 years of experience at major financial institutions and will be helping the startup expand its product offering and client base, Tradewind said.  “Michael is a leader with significant experience working with corporations, creating capital-efficient products, operating at scale, and delivering value to shareholders,” Blake Darcy, executive chairman of Tradewind, said in a press release. “The board and I are confident that he is the right person to take Tradewind to the next level in our global pursuit of a more efficient, transparent, secure and cost-effective precious metals ecosystem.”  Tradewind, launched in March 2018 with the goal of putting gold trading on a blockchain, was backed early on by IEX, the stock exchange featured in Michael Lewis' bestseller ""Flash Boys."" IEX's former head of product Matt Trudeau is a co-founder of Tradewind and served as its president (he is now chief strategy officer at crypto futures exchange ErisX). The startup says it's using the VaultChain blockchain based on R3's Corda platform.  Until now, Tradewind didn't have a CEO, only a director, Mike Haughton, who will keep his job, according to the company's press representative.  Albanese spent 15 years at JPMorgan, the last three of them in collateral management. Before that, he worked as global head of securities clearance, head of the corporate trust business in Japan, and a vice president of product management for global corporate trust.  “Clear opportunities exist to improve how physical assets trade, settle, are custodied, and are mobilized as collateral—both in the precious metals space and beyond,” Albanese said in the press release. “Smart deployment of technology can benefit multiple participants in the ecosystem. I am excited to join a company that has already successfully executed on a major asset class.”  Tradewind has secured partnerships with such entities as the Royal Canadian Mint and Asahi Refining, as well as funding by large metal producers like Goldcorp, Agnico Eagle Mines, IAMGOLD and Wheaton Precious Metals. It's raised a total of $19.6 million, according to Crunchbase.

42402882,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddN4k,1556623867,Bitcoin's Price Closes In on First 3-Month Win Streak Since 2017,"View  Bitcoin is set to end April with around 26 percent gains. The growth marks the third straight monthly increase and the first three-month winning streak since the final quarter of 2017.  A falling channel breakout seen on the monthly chart confirms a long-term bullish reversal. A similar breakout seen in October 2015 had paved way for a record rally to $20,000.  Bitcoin may post stellar gains in May if the 30-day MA, currently at $5,142, reverses the recent pullback. In that case, prices could rise to $6,000.  A close below the 30-day MA at $5,142 would validate the bearish indicator divergence and allow a deeper drop toward the 50-day MA, currently at $4,675.  Bitcoin (BTC) is on track to confirm a long-term bullish reversal with a first three-month winning streak for over a year.  The crypto market leader is currently trading at $5,166, representing a 26.58 percent gain on the monthly opening price of $4,081, having gained 9.8 and 8.16 percent in February and March, respectively, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  That is the first three-month run of gains since the last quarter of 2017. Back then, the cryptocurrency appreciated by 48, 54 and 39 percent in October, November and December, respectively.  Bitcoin's previous three-month bullish wave ended with prices topping out at a lifetime high of around $20,000 in December 2017. The cryptocurrency entered a bear market in the first quarter of 2018 to hit lows near $3,100 in December 2018.  The cryptocurrency ended the record six-month losing streak with a 9.8 percent rise this February, having scored gains in just three months during 2018.  The 26.58 percent monthly gain seen at press time is the biggest since April 2018 when prices rallied 33 percent.  April gains would have been in excess of 35 percent had the cryptocurrency managed to hold on to five-month highs above $5,600 hit on April 23.  Nevertheless, BTC has achieved a feat last seen at the height of the bull market in the final months of 2017 and has extended its three-year April winning run.  More importantly, with the solid double-digit monthly gain, the cryptocurrency has violated a long-term bearish channel, confirming a bull breakout. A similar pattern seen in October 2015 paved way for a 2.5-year long bull market.  Monthly chart  As seen above (left), BTC topped out at the then-record high of $1,163 in November 2013 and fell into a bear market in February 2014, (prices via Bitstamp).  In the following months, the cryptocurrency established a falling channel – bearish lower highs and lower lows – which was breached to the higher side in October 2015. That bullish breakout was followed by a rally to $20,000 by December 2017.  So, bitcoin's latest channel breakout could be considered a confirmation of the long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change first signaled by bitcoin's convincing move above $4,236 on April 2.  The probability of BTC posting a strong follow-through over the coming months is high, as the cryptocurrency is set to undergo a mining reward halving in May 2020. The process, aimed at curbing inflation by reducing the reward for mining on bitcoin's blockchain by half, is repeated every four years and tends to put a strong bid under prices.  Notably, bitcoin's previous bull market ended with a bearish channel breakout almost a year ahead of the reward halving in July 2016.  Looking forward, with the monthly chart flashing a historically bullish price pattern, BTC looks likely to register gains in a seasonally mixed month of May.  Bitcoin has registered gains in May in five out of the last 8 years.  The positive takeaway is that the losses in May have mostly been significantly less than the gains.  The odds of BTC posting gains in May, however, would fall sharply if the price finds acceptance below the crucial 30-day MA, currently at $5,142.  Daily chart        On the daily chart, BTC is currently hovering around the 30-day MA, which reversed pullbacks in March and has served as a base throughout the rally from lows near $3,300 seen in February. As a result, a strong bounce from that average could invite buying pressure, leading to a rally to $6,000.  A deeper drop to the 50-day MA at $4,675 could be seen if prices find acceptance below the 30-day MA, validating the short-term bearish case put forward by the bearish divergence of the 14-day relative strength index.

42402875,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddMxr,1556622055,ErisX Launches Crypto Spot Market on Heels of New $20 Million Raise,"Aspiring crypto derivatives provider ErisX took one step closer to its ultimate goal Tuesday with the launch of a spot market.  The exchange announced that it will immediately support dollar trading pairs with bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin and ethereum, as well as bitcoin trading pairs with the other three cryptocurrencies at launch. While ErisX has a number of firms looking to trade on its platform at launch, it did not disclose any names.  Chief strategy officer Matt Trudeau told CoinDesk that, at launch, ErisX's platform will include both its exchange and clearinghouse, allowing it to take custody of both cash and cryptocurrencies. That being said, he added:  ""The spot market is really the first component of our overall corporate strategy of what we’re looking to do in 2019.""  While the spot market launch is a ""major milestone,"" Trudeau sees it as merely an initial step in the company's broader road map. Up next is ErisX's derivatives offerings, which are still pending regulatory approval. Should the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sign off on the startup's derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license application, it plans to also offer futures on each of those cryptocurrencies as well.  Trudeau was not able to speak to ErisX's progress with the application process, saying only, ""We are engaged in an active dialogue with the CFTC and appreciate the staff's diligence in reviewing our application.""  Ongoing process  Although ErisX is formally launching its spot market Tuesday, the exchange still has work to complete, said CEO Thomas Chippas in a statement.  ""We know that a launch such as this is a process, not a one-off event,"" he said. ""We are moving from an initial phase to a public launch, and will continue to work with our partners, investors and regulators to expand access.""  Trudeau concurred, saying that many of ErisX's current team have backgrounds working with exchanges and clearinghouses. Just launching a platform is a ""nontrivial"" amount of work, which is then followed by onboarding clients.  ""Some people will be there in time for your production launch, others will be later,"" he said.  Still, he anticipates that ErisX will see customers for both its spot and futures market onboard in the coming months, as the exchange continues developing its platform.  ""We look forward to a point where exchanges become so reliable and so performant that the market almost starts to take them for granted, that [they may already] do for other, more mature capital markets,"" he said. ""In terms of fundamental infrastructure, we hope to make a competent [platform], that people confidently use our exchange and clearinghouse.""  Continued fundraising  ErisX is continuing to build out its technology, as well as raise funds to support it, Trudeau told CoinDesk.  ""There’s a process to building a new market, so the exchange technology needs to be deployed, the [clearinghouse] stack needs to be deployed and tested, there also needs to be new clients,"" he said.  To continue developing these technology stacks, ErisX has just raised a third round of Series B investments, adding another $20 million to its total.  Arc Light Securities, Castle Island Ventures, Dragonfly Capital Partners, Flow Traders, Tradestation, NYDIG, Cboe Global Markets, CMT Digital, ConsenSys, CTC, DRW Venture Capital, ED&F Man Capital Markets, Nasdaq Ventures, Pantera Capital, Susquehanna International and Virtu Financial all participated in the round.  ErisX also raised $27.5 million as part of its Series B round last December, which saw many of the same firms participate, alongside Bitmain, Fidelity Investments and Monex Group. TD Ameritrade has also backed the exchange in the past.  The initial amount raised during its Series B was not disclosed, and it is not clear how much in total ErisX has raised to date.  In other ErisX news, NYDIG COO and CFO Rob Flatley has been named to ErisX's board, joining members including ConsenSys' Joseph Lubin.

42402868,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddMrx,1556618419,Voters on Ethereum App Veto Proposal to Fund Polkadot Blockchain,"Aragon (ANT) token holders have voted to restrict the project's development funds from being used to support work on the blockchain interoperability platform Polkadot.  Aragon is an ethereum-based project that builds tools and applications for decentralized organizations. It raised over $25 million in an initial coin offering back in 2017. At present, the non-profit organization – the Aragon Association – in charge of accumulated investment holds roughly $30 million in ETH and another $6 million in other crypto and fiat currencies.  This past weekend, token holders of Aragon voted on a proposal to further diversify project funds into a new type of currency not yet publicly available for sale. Aragon Governance Proposal (AGP) 41 proposes that the Association buy up to $1.5 million worth of DOT tokens, which would be used to further the development of Polkadot.  The DOT token price was not disclosed in AGP 41 for “legal reasons” according to Aragon One CEO Luis Cuende. However, back in January of this year, it was reported that Polkadot was seeking $60 million in funding after raising an initial $145 million during its first token sale.  Yet there's apprehension within the ethereum community toward Polkadot, with some seeing it as a direct competitor. In fact, one ethereum developer, after remarking on the speed of Polkadot development, was heckled mercilessly on social media and subsequently quit the ethereum community.  This time, along with AGP 41, a competing proposal was created by Ameen Soleimani, CEO of adult entertainment blockchain platform Spankchain, in a bid to block development of Aragon on any other network than ethereum.  How the vote went down  As tweeted out on Saturday, Aragon (ANT) token holders ultimately rejected both proposals.  A reported 92.29 percent of votes on AGP 41 were against the proposal. Conversely, only 68.71 percent of votes on AGP 42 were against keeping Aragon development focused strictly on ethereum and not Polkadot.  The main reason behind the rejection of AGP 41, according to Cuende, was due to the lack of transparency over the pricing of DOTs.  “I think if we could make the price public and there was a new proposal with the price public, I think people would be way less concerned and would probably vote yes,” Cuende told CoinDesk.  Cuended added that AGP 41's rejection came down to a matter of token holder trust in the Aragon Association. In Cuende's view, ANT holders don't trust the Association to make wise investment decisions without knowing all the important details of the token sale such as price.  ""If you want to build a democracy, you have to have very diligent citizens that think adversarially,"" he commented.  While the Aragon Association will not invest in DOT tokens as a result of Saturday’s vote results, individual board members of the Association like Cuende have expressed their intention to buy up DOTs at the privately disclosed price regardless.  Next steps  Moving forward, Cuende highlighted that he hopes to see a different Aragon developer team that isn’t Aragon One take on the initiative of exploring blockchain “infrastructure” options for the Aragon project more deeply.  “We at Aragon One...have always been doing initial research [on Polkadot] but we don’t have the bandwidth to take on this effort ourselves,” noted Cuende. “We are going to be looking for another flock team, that is, another Aragon [developer] team, that may actually be able to take on infrastructure in general.”  Of course, this idea would be subject to another community vote where funding is approved by ANT holders, similar to how developer team Aragon Black received its funding of $450,000 during the most recent round of voting.  This being the third official round of voting to conclude on Aragon, Cuende told CoinDesk that only about 4.8 percent of all available ANT tokens actually participated.  The participation rate not being nearly as high as Cuende would like, he told CoinDesk that plans are underway to incorporate other mechanism designs to encourage greater token holder participation.  “We’re working on [token delegation] for the next version of the Aragon client where you basically delegate tokens to another entity,” explained Cuende. “Even if the interface is really great and you can vote with two clicks, it’s still a lot of work to read about what’s going on and inform yourself and vote.”  AraCon 2019 image courtesy of Aragon One",NEGATIVE,DOT | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/30/voters-on-ethereum-app-veto-proposal-to-fund-polkadot-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/993412479d2f75e08318276462103e200189c58f-1280x721.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402863,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddMo1,1556611246,"Bitfinex Is Planning to Issue an Exchange Token, Shareholder Says","Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex may soon issue a proprietary exchange token, according to a shareholder of the platform claiming knowledge of the plan.  Dong Zhao, a well-known over-the-counter trader in China who holds a stake in Bitfinex, who first announced the news on Weibo, told CoinDesk that the exchange is indeed planning the issuance, although the ""details are not 100 percent confirmed.""  Bitfinex has not responded to a CoinDesk request for comment as of press time.  It's unclear at this stage how the plan would play out or what exactly participants in an exchange token offering would be promised. However, if confirmed, the claim is notable as it comes soon after allegations from the New York Attorney General's office that Bitfinex lost $850 million in customer and corporate funds.  Subsequently, the attorney general said, Bitfinex then secretly arranged a $900 million loan from the exchange's affiliated company Tether, which issues the tether (USDT) stablecoin, to cover the shortfall.  Bitfinex later claimed that the $850 million had been ""seized"" by various authorities and that it was working to retrieve the funds.  Zhao, who is also the founder of blockchain investment firm DGroup, said it was he who suggested the token plan to Bitfinex. On April 28, days after the New York AG's allegations, he said on his Weibo account that the exchange should take the opportunity to issue tokens worth $850 million to bring in tether equal to the frozen amount. Participants would get the exchange token in return.  He told CoinDesk that the advantage to users is that ""exchange tokens have better liquidity. They are the only real token that is not a shitcoin.""  ""The issuance method could be similar to that of other exchange tokens, which were distributed through pre-paid trading fee packages,"" he said, and later added he would do his best to make the deal happen.  Zhao's suggestion has had a mixed reception on Weibo, with some skeptical on whether Bitfinex is indeed able to recover the frozen funds.  ""Didn't Bitfinex say [there] are certain the funds can be recovered? If so, then no other plans are needed. But if they issue tokens to swap debts to shares, that could mean those funds are really gone and could lower the platform's credibility,"" one user commented.  Last Friday, Zhao said that Bitfinex's chief financial officer told him the frozen $850 million would be recovered ""within a few weeks.""  Dovey Wan, founding partner of blockchain fund Primitive, has also raised several inconsistencies regarding public information about Bitifnex and Tether so far.  For instance, in one tweet that also noted Bitfinex's exchange token plans, she said, ""if the $850 million can be easily crawled back, then why [would it do] initial exchange offering?"" and ""if Bitfinex is highly cash flow positive, why borrowed from Tether?""

And while Bitfinex doesn’t exactly rhyme with Mt. Gox, there are several parallels in the stories of these two exchanges. People interested in understanding Bitfinex are well-served to understand what happened with Mt. Gox.  Bitfinex and Tether were investigated  by the New York York Attorney General (NYAG). Here’s a synopsis for those unfamiliar with the story. Bitfinex is a cryptocurrency exchange, the owners of which also control Tether, issuer of the most popular stablecoin, known as tether or USDT. The NYAG accuses Bitfinex of losing over $800 million. It alleges the exchange tried to recoup those losses by dipping into the cash reserves of tether, the stablecoin its principals also control.  Problem is, taking money held by Tether would render the stablecoin more or less useless. This is because Tether is supposedly backed by cash reserves and there are people who still believe this. Yet if there are no cash reserves, or significantly less cash than believed, then the whole concept of Tether is essentially fraudulent.  This is laid out in the filing from late last week. At the end of the document, the NYAG issues an ultimatum. The office “does seek to enjoin Respondents from taking any further action to access, loan, extend credit, encumber, pledge, or make any other similar transfer or claim between Bitfinex and Tether.”  Where’s the money?  The cliff for BTC on Coinbase April 25 once the Bitfinex/Tether lawsuit dropped. Source:Tradingview  One may rightly wonder: how exactly did Bitfinex manage to lose more than $800 million? The answer is closely intertwined with the exchange's banking relationships, or lack thereof. Crypto “OGs” and insiders may be feeling like they’ve seen this movie before.  Indeed, those feelings would be quite valid. In the early days of crypto, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges, known as Mt. Gox, also got into significant trouble due primarily to its banking relationships. It got so bad that in February of 2014, Mt. Gox stopped all trading and filed for bankruptcy protection. At the time, it claimed to have lost 624,408 BTC.  What unbanked, noncompliant cryptocurrency exchange holdings look like. Source: Wizsec  A Japanese bank that handled Mt. Gox’s cash transactions had been trying to close its account. In addition, no U.S. banks would work with Mt. Gox. This made it essentially impossible for Mt. Gox to send users’ cash back to them when they tried to withdraw their money. Users experienced delays of weeks or months until the exchange shut down unceremoniously.  In the case of Mt. Gox, the fallout lingered for a long time and still continues to this day. If history is any guide, we can expect any potential fallout from significant troubles experienced by Bitfinex to linger too. While this should give many participants in the crypto industry pause, it is an excellent opportunity to reflect on the state of crypto in general – and for the crypto space to do a little soul-searching.  Exchange implosions  At issue in 2019 is the presence of so many problematic cryptocurrency exchanges. Spectacular failures where hundreds of millions of dollars go missing, in the case of Bitfinex, are not good. The fact that this appears to be happening again in the span of five years speaks volumes.  From the Mt. Gox crisis docs. Could other failing exchanges try to follow this same playbook? Source:CoinDesk  This industry is still young, immature, and experiencing growing pains. These latest issues with Bitfinex are also a learning opportunity. It’s now clear that exchanges without normal banking relationships are the weakest link in this volatile market. Now prominent traders and funds have been pulling assets from exchanges in fairly large amounts.  Inflow/outflows on BItfinex by USD value. Activity has increased since the allegations were announced. Source: TokenAnalyst  One can understand why exchange outflow would increase in the current environment. Certain exchanges clearly cannot be trusted to safeguard cryptocurrency assets.  It is time for some of the best engineers and developers to turn their attention to the most basic of mandates: Compliance and custody for crypto. Until there is an improved layer of trust, it will be difficult for this industry to grow in ways many advocates want to see.  Lawyer Stephen Palley knows crypto folks want BTC to be worth a ton. Yet that will only happen with much stronger and more compliant exchange infrastructure. Source: Twitter  What does 'custody' really mean?  Cryptocurrency goes beyond just computer science at this point. Experts are needed – people who have experience in the various arts and sciences needed to safeguard large amounts of money.  This is what is meant when using the word ""custody."" More security, legal, regulatory, and compliance experts are required to push this ecosystem to new frontiers. Auditors, accountants, and experienced financial operators with enough seasoning in the traditional world. These people should have a vision for the challenges and also the amazing promise of crypto. And innovations in bank-backed stablecoins such as USDC and PAX are a great start.  “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” There’s certainly a familiar rhyme going around right now. It’s easy to look back at Mt. Gox and see similarities to Bitfinex and Tether. This time, though, it's arguably even more complex given the Tether stablecoin inflows and outflows.  Yet all the same signals, like the large price spread between Bitfinex and regulated exchanges such as Coinbase, are there. And we can stop the repetitive, ""Groundhog Day""-type scenarios. We can do better and not let this happen ever again.  Bill Murray is trapped in a mysterious time loop in the movie ""Groundhog Day."" Crypto doesn’t always have to repeat the same mistakes over and over. Source: Moviefone  We may be trying to build a better world at the intersection of finance and technology with crypto. However, perhaps it is time to acknowledge that we can learn some things from the legacy financial systems on Wall Street we are working to upgrade.  It’s not about “teaching an old dog new tricks,” but rather about a young, promising puppy learning a few tricks from the old dogs who’ve been managing money for a couple of centuries.  Mt.
