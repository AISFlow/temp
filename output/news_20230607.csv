42420274,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUemWz,1686178860,UK FCA Proposes Ban on Crypto Incentives in Tough New Marketing Rules,"The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is set to put in place tough new rules for crypto advertising as soon as planned laws for the industry are finalized, according to documents published Thursday.  Under the new rules, crypto will be classified as “restricted mass market investments,” which will require any advertisements or promotions to contain “clear risk warnings,” and bans incentives to invest such as “refer a friend” or “new joiner bonuses,” the regulator said.  Crypto is set to be included in the scope of U.K.’s regulated financial activities through the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which represents the country’s post-Brexit financial strategy and is currently moving through Parliament. With the bill, the FCA gets powers to set rules for the sector in accordance with the applicable laws.  When the FCA consulted on these rules last year, respondents largely disagreed with the proposals including the regulator’s intention to treat crypto as a high risk investment and to block new investors from receiving non-real-time promotion offers (DOFP), the report said. The FCA will proceed with these measures nonetheless, it added.  Alongside the upcoming rules, the FCA also opened for public comment new guidance aimed at ensuring “firms clearly understand the implications of this requirement for crypto asset promotions,” the document said.  The proposed guidance says crypto firms should carry out “adequate due diligence and have sufficient evidence of the underlying crypto asset to ensure the financial promotion is fair, clear and not misleading.”  For those communicating promotions for stablecoin firms, they will have to ensure that claims regarding stability or links to a fiat currency are not misleading. It also set out a range of other measures.  The new rules on promotions have been put forward because estimated crypto ownership in the U.K. doubled from 2021 to 2022 with 10% of 2,000 people surveyed by the regulator stating that they own crypto, according to a separate report published by the FCA.  The FCA also set out this strategy as part of its commitment to reduce and prevent serious harm, a press release said.  ""It is up to people to decide whether they buy crypto. But research shows many regret making a hasty decision,” Sheldon Mills, executive director of consumers and competition at the FCA said in a press release. “Our rules give people the time and the right risk warnings to make an informed choice.”  If firms breach the FCA’s upcoming promotion rules they could face up to two years of imprisonment, a fine or both.  Starting on Oct. 8, the marketing of ""qualifying cryptoassets"" will fall within the scope of the FCA's promotions regime, and registered crypto firms will be able to approve their own advertisements under a temporary exemption, the document said.

13600807,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536840,1686178803,Cardano (ADA) Declines As Market Recovers Amid Security Charges,"Cardano (ADA) has emerged as one of the worst performers over the last day despite the rest of the market seeing some upside. This can be attributed to the security charges from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a classification that has loomed heavy over staking tokens in the last year. Cardano Foundation Deny Security Claims In the SEC lawsuits that have circulated against crypto exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase this week, the SEC has pointed to some cryptocurrencies as being securities in a bid to nail the exchanges for unregistered securities trading. Related Reading: Not Immune To FUD? Binance Sees $1.5 Billion In Outflows In 24 Hours One of the cryptocurrencies that were named is Cardano, a network that uses a proof of stake mechanism where users stake their native token, ADA, to help secure the network, and earn rewards for it. ADA was named among a list of other tokens including MATIC, BUSD, BNB, FIL, SOL, SAND, ATOM, MANA, COTI, AXS, and ALGO. And despite this already long list, the SEC seems to believe more tokens qualify as securities given the wording of “including but not limited to.” In light of this recent classification by the SEC, the Cardano Foundation has come forward to contest the regulator’s claims. In a tweet on its official page, the foundation expressed its disagreement with this classification and said it looked forward to working with regulators. “The Cardano Foundation disagrees with the recent qualification of ADA as a security under US law. We look forward to the continued engagement with regulators and policymakers to achieve legal clarity and certainty on these matters,” the Foundation said. ADA price falls to $0.33 | Source: ADAUSD on TradingView.com ADA Continues To Struggle Despite the Cardano Foundation taking to Twitter to debunk the SEC’s claims of ADA being a security, the coin has not fared well in the market. While the general market is on a recovery trend with Bitcoin moving back above $26,000, ADA has remained stagnant. Out of the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, ADA is currently the worst performer of the bunch. Where Bitcoin and Ethereum are seeing an upside of around 3% at this time, Cardano’s token is nursing 3.6% losses. Its performance is even worse on the weekly chart with 9% losses in seven days. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz Says This Will Kickstart The Bitcoin Bull Market ADA’s performance is not out of the ordinary as such a classification has put selling pressure on the digital asset. Investors are understandably moving to remove some of their holdings for fear of further legal action from the SEC. However, there has been no indication of what the regulator plans to do against the digital assets it classified as securities. At the time of writing, ADA is changing hands at a price of $0.3406, bringing its total market cap to $11.89 billion.

42420268,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUemQn,1686172243,‘Stand With Crypto’ NFT Spreads Across Crypto Twitter Amid SEC Crackdown,"The past 48 hours have been grim for the crypto industry. On Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued crypto exchange Binance and its founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao for allegedly violating federal securities laws. The next day, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase over similar allegations. Later in the afternoon, the SEC sought to freeze assets related to Binance.US, the exchange’s US-based entity.  The crackdown isn’t surprising to some; however, it’s added to the frustration around the lack of policy and regulatory clarity in the United States surrounding crypto. While the lawsuits are so far only against Binance and Coinbase, the entire industry has been shaken up by the news, and the value of tokens named in the filings has plummeted. Some critics hyperbolized that the situation could mark the downfall of crypto.  But those native to the crypto space are familiar with cycles of volatility and regulatory pushback and have urged one another to be outspoken in their support of a decentralized financial future. Since Monday morning, figures across the crypto space have minted Coinbase’s Stand with Crypto non-fungible token (NFT) on minting platform Zora to mark their commitment to crypto while demanding regulatory clarity.  An NFT for Regulatory Clarity  In April, as regulatory fears continued to consume the crypto space following the series of crypto banking collapses, Coinbase rolled out its open-edition mint of the Stand with Crypto NFT. According to its listing on Zora, the commemorative NFT symbolizes the crypto community’s desire for regulatory clarity and commitment to the space despite legal challenges.  After minting the NFT, Twitter users have been called to display a shield emoji in their username in solidarity with the movement.  “We stand united with the crypto community in our efforts to advocate for sensible crypto policy in the U.S.,” a spokesperson for Coinbase told CoinDesk. “The Stand with Crypto commemorative NFT is a symbol of unity for the crypto community – representing our collective stand to protect and promote the potential of crypto in the United States.”  While the Stand with Crypto NFT is free to mint, the site specifies that platform mint fees will be donated to vetted organizations via Crypto Advocacy Round through Gitcoin to support crypto advocacy efforts.  At the time of writing, over 138,000 of the NFTs have been minted. Prominent figures across the NFT and crypto space have minted the NFT so far.  When Zora released the collection in April, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted that he had just minted one of the NFTs.  Tuesday night, following the lawsuit, he tweeted the link once again.  Other figures in the space also tweeted shield emojis to underscore their support.  Alex Xu, the founder of popular NFT collection Azuki who goes by Zagabond on Twitter, posted an edit of his profile picture (PFP) with Coinbase shield artwork.  “Coinbase has been the most compliant exchange and has onboarded millions of people into crypto,” Xu said in a tweet. “I supportBrian Armstrong for standing up to the SEC and hope this fight brings more regulatory clarity for the entire space.”  However, while sentiment around the shield has mostly been positive, some Twitter users have critiqued Armstrong for using the NFT to virtue signal.  “If your CEO tweets this after being sued by the SEC it’s over,” said Twitter user BuccoCapital Guy. “Also, your ‘Stand with Crypto’ NFT hits a little differently when you tweet it from your $113M compound.”",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/06/07/stand-with-crypto-nft-spreads-across-crypto-twitter-amid-sec-crackdown,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a7558da5a7c1471b1f66bee27e44b53c39ab6a20-758x505.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Material Indicators suggest that if this happens, the liquidity and sentiment at the 50-Month MA will be stronger, potentially leading to a bullish market reversal. However, it is important to note that a “rug pull” at $25,000 – a sudden and significant drop in BTC’s price – could lead to a bearish market and further retest of the lower levels of $24,000 and $23,000. For the bulls, it is crucial to maintain control of the $27,000 level and push BTC’s price above the next significant resistance at $27,500. Doing so would allow the cryptocurrency to make another attempt at reaching the key psychological level of $30,000, which it has not achieved since April 19th. On the same note, according to Baro Virtual, a Crypto Quant author, the leverage ratio is overheating, potentially leading to a dip in BTC’s price to $24,000. The leverage ratio refers to the borrowed funds traders use to invest in BTC. When the leverage ratio increases, traders take on more debt to invest in the cryptocurrency. This can lead to a higher level of risk in the market, as a sudden drop in BTC’s price could trigger a significant amount of selling, resulting in a dip in price. BTC’s Bullish Engulfing Pattern Signals Buying Opportunities According to CJ, a cryptocurrency trader, there are several points that he is leaning into which could potentially provide opportunities for buying BTC. CJ notes that BTC has experienced a range of low deviation and reclaim and a daily bullish engulfing pattern. These indicators suggest that any dips into the FVG (fair value gap) are buying opportunities, with a target of $29,000-$30,000 liquidity. However, a close below $26,100 would be bearish for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s recent price movements have left traders and investors unsure of what to expect in the near term. While the cryptocurrency initially showed a bullish reaction to the fair value gap, with a bullish 4-hour candle, it is now retracing. It remains to be seen whether BTC can bounce back once again from its 200-week Moving Average or if a sudden and significant drop in price will push BTC into a new price regime and visit the lower levels. Despite the uncertainty in the market, BTC is currently trading above key levels, and it needs to close above $26,000 to expect a further continuation of the uptrend. BTC’s gains in the past 24 hours have narrowed to only 0.8% after a recovery of 8% in the last few days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Loss Remains Low Despite Volatility, What Does This Mean?

His comments came after the SEC on Tuesday sued Coinbase for a swath of violations, including allegations the company sold unregistered securities. A ten-state coalition led by the Alabama Securities Commission also took aim at the exchange, slapping Coinbase with allegations the company’s staking program had violated various state securities laws.  Coinbase’s staking service is a cornerstone of the company’s strategy to diversify its largely trading fee-dependent revenue base. In 2022, roughly 90% of the company’s revenue came from transaction fees, but the company’s earnings have plunged as a prolonged crypto bear market has caused some investors to turn away from trading.  Armstrong insisted Coinbase would not be at risk of a bank-run-like rush of withdrawals similar to those some of its peers have suffered. “All the funds are backed one-to-one, and you don't have to take our word for it,” Armstrong said. “As a public company, we have auditors … who have gone in and verified all that.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/07/coinbase-ceo-armstrong-says-not-shutting-down-staking-service,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c424f2996566b45536a31ff060b350926d449890-2001x3000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As the crypto community collectively holds its breath, the dog-inspired cryptocurrency could skyrocket to major highs sooner than expected. The latest catalyst propelling SHIB’s resurgence is a leap into the Metaverse. On June 6, the Shiba Inu Metaverse division unveiled its impending release of the long-awaited Rocket Pond trailer. As an integral part of Shiba’s virtual cosmos, the reveal of this trailer is set to enchant audiences with a peek into the Metaverse odyssey. The Dawn Of The SHIB Metaverse: Rocket Pond Since the unveiling of Rocket Pond’s initial sketch in September 2022, the SHIB community has been buzzing with anticipation.

My issue here isn't with regulation but the clumsy way it is implemented. Meanwhile, Hong Kong has laid the groundwork to become Asia's crypto hub. Crypto is a global phenomenon, so I believe it will survive the SEC's attacks. Overview The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), on Monday, June 6, in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, filed 13 charges against Binance Holdings Limited ( BNB-USD ), operators of Binance.com—the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume. Binance and some major crypto firms and exchanges have been in the crosshairs of the SEC, as the SEC tries to tighten crypto regulation and make crypto firms and exchanges comply with its somewhat obscure securities laws. The new wave of regulatory attacks has struck panic into the crypto market, with cryptocurrencies falling across the board. Nonetheless, my belief is that, the most the SEC can do is change the landscape in the crypto world, but it will not be able to significantly limit demand, especially when it comes to Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The SEC Attacks Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (popularly known as CZ) and Binance's US-based affiliate BAM Trading Services Inc. (BAM Trading) were charged alongside Binance. Part of the charges brought forward by the SEC includes allegations of operating unregistered exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies, and the unregistered offer and sale of crypto assets. while Zhao and Binance publicly claimed that U.S. customers were restricted from transacting on Binance.com, Zhao and Binance in reality subverted their controls to secretly allow high-value U.S. customers to continue trading on the Binance.com platform, Source: SEC Binance launched its US-based trading platform Binance.US in 2019, when it announced its partnership with BAM trading. The SEC has alleged that Binance, CZ, and BAM Trading ""engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law."" The SEC has also labelled several tokens listed and traded on Binance.US as securities, citing an unlawful solicitation of US investors to buy, sell, and trade crypto asset securities and a conscious evasion of US securities laws. In the charges filed, the SEC also alleged that while CZ and Binance publicly claimed that the Binance.US platform was a separate, autonomous trading platform created for US-based investors and operated by a separate entity, in reality, CZ and Binance controlled Binance.US behind the scenes. Another securities law violation cited by the SEC is the offer and sale of Binance’s crypto assets, which includes its exchange token BNB-USD, its Paxos-issued stablecoin ( BUSD-USD ), some DeFi products, and a staking-as-a-service program. Court documents also listed Solana ( SOL-USD ), Cardano ( ADA-USD ), Polygon ( MATIC-USD ), FileCoin ( FIL-USD ), Cosmos ( ATOM-USD ), Sandbox ( SAND-USD ), Decentraland ( MANA-USD ), Algorand ( ALGO-USD ), Axie Infinity ( AXS-USD ), and COTI ( COTI-USD ) as crypto asset securities, citing that they are offered and sold as investment contracts. The SEC charged Binance for the unregistered offers and sales of BNB, BUSD, and crypto-lending products known as Simple Earn and BNB Vault, Source: SEC press release According to the SEC, Binance failed to restrict US-based investors from accessing Binance.com even though Binance claims that US-based investors can't trade on the platform. CZ has been accused by the SEC of allowing many high-value US-based customers concealed access to Binance.com. The SEC further alleged that CZ and Binance exercise control of customers' assets at Binance.US and these assets are commingled and diverted to other entities, including Sigma Chain—an entity owned and controlled by CZ. These allegations of commingling of users' funds bear similarity with the events that led to the collapse of FTX as users' funds were commingled and used for trade at Sam Bankman-Fried's Alameda research. Similar to Alameda Research's wash trading to prop up trade volume on FTX, the SEC accused CZ-owned Sigma Chain of engaging in manipulative trading to artificially inflate Binance.US' trading volume. Binance's Response Binance has expressed disappointment at the SEC's charges. In a press release , Binance claims it has actively cooperated with the SEC's investigations and worked hard to answer all questions and address all of the SEC's concerns. Binance says it has recently reached a negotiated settlement with the SEC. Binance revealed that despite efforts to cooperate with the SEC and reach a settlement, the SEC abandoned the negotiation process and chose to act unilaterally by filing charges. Binance declared in its statement that the SEC's allegations that users' assets on Binance.US were never at risk or commingled. Today’s action is another in a line of examples where, as with other crypto projects facing similar suits, the Commission has determined to regulate with the blunt weapons of enforcement and litigation rather than the thoughtful, nuanced approach demanded by this dynamic and complex technology, Source: Binance press release Binance has vehemently denied the SEC's allegations and has vowed to defend against any allegations vigorously. Coinbase in the Cross Hairs The SEC's approach to crypto regulation has become a thorn in the side of US-based crypto firms. Barely twenty-four hours after the SEC filed charges against Binance and its CEO, the SEC, in a US District Court for the Southern District of New York filed complaints against Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ). The SEC revealed in a press release that Coinbase has been charged for operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency, saying since 2019 Coinbase made billions of dollars unlawfully by facilitating the buying and selling of crypto asset securities. The SEC also alleged that Coinbase violated US securities laws by engaging in an unregistered securities offering through its staking-as-a-service program. Brain Armstrong, Coinbase CEO, in reaction to the SEC's litigation, said that regulators have failed to publish a clear rule book, giving conflicting statements on what a crypto asset should be a security or a commodity. Armstrong said the firm is confident in its facts and the law, hinting at a possibility of facing the SEC at the courts just like Ripple Labs (XRP-USD) has done for over two years. Brad Garlinghouse CEO of Ripple Labs, another major crypto firm that has been in a legal brawl with the SEC for over two years, reacted to the latest events. Garlinghouse, in a tweet , suggested that the SEC is using these charges to divert attention from its involvement in the FTX fiasco. What does this mean for Binance, Coinbase and Crypto? The SEC’s attack on crypto exchanges is nothing new, but it does come at an interesting time, just as Hong Kong has opened the doors to retail investors . This puts the SEC’s actions into perspective. Crypto is a global phenomenon, and the SEC only has control over the US. Sure , this is a big market now, but global crypto adoption should one day dwarf this. Contrary to what most believe, Binance might be in better shape than a company like Coinbase. If the SEC is hell-bent on fighting crypto, then it can probably curtail most of Coinbase’s activities since this is a US-based company. Binance, on the other hand, has a global footprint. Having said this, I don’t expect the US to eliminate crypto completely. Regulation is a necessary evil; my only issue is the clumsy approach the regulatory body has taken. Until this blows over, one can, and probably should anyway, store their crypto in a cold wallet. Takeaway This isn't the first time the SEC will bring charges against a crypto firm; however, the crypto market reacted to the news of the Binance litigation, causing a slight drop in the prices of major cryptocurrencies. To avoid a similar fallout with the SEC, some US-based crypto exchanges, like Robinhood (HOOD) , have hinted at delisting crypto assets labelled as securities in the SEC's litigation against Binance. Ultimately, I believe in buying the fear, and I hold some small positions in BNB and COIN.",NEGATIVE,BNB,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4610093-binance-sec-strikes-again-again?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13596175.jpeg

Crypto markets extend losses as central banks globally signal further rate hikes.  Major cryptocurrencies targeted as unregistered securities in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase dropped sharply to lead an altcoin sell-off Wednesday as traders sought the relative safety of bitcoin (BTC).  BNB, the Binance Smart Chain’s native token, dropped 8% in the last 24 hours to as low as $252, its lowest price since early January, according to CoinDesk data. Cardano’s ADA, Polygon’s MATIC and Solana’s SOL, all top 10 tokens by market capitalization, also nosedived between 6% and 8% through the day.  BTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was outperforming, down 0.9% over the same period and changing hands at around $26,500. BTC has been trading between $25,000 and $27,000 for much of the past week.  Ether (ETH) was changing hands at $1,850, down 1.3% through the day, performing roughly in line with broader digital asset markets. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which tracks the price action of a basket of cryptocurrencies, declined 1.1%.  Unregistered securities  The SEC’s inclusion of 13 altcoins in its filings Monday and Tuesday weighed on those token’s prices, potentially restricting U.S. investors’ trading offerings.  “Altcoins are under pressure as the SEC has made it clear they will make it nearly impossible for key exchanges to offer them,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at broker platform Oanda.  “With an SEC tag of being a security, crypto traders are abandoning ship with BNB, ADA, MATIC, and SOL, with some moving those funds towards bitcoin.”  These tokens might extend their losing streak, particularly if the SEC looks to restrict staking, institutional-focused digital asset brokerage Enigma Securities said in a market report.  “ADA in particular would be the major victim, with its growth over the last 4-5 years heavily driven by consumer staking,” Joe Edwards, head of research at Enigma wrote.

42420276,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUema5,1686164892,12 Ways Web3 Media Could Embrace AI,"This article was not written by AI. But will that be the case in the future?  As questions about artificial intelligence dominate every industry -- from crypto to law to farming -- it’s only natural that newsrooms, too, are weighing the promise and the peril.  “Artificial intelligence will soon transform media on a scale and pace that rivals the internet two decades ago,” predicts a recent Axios newsletter. “The media companies that survive -- and thrive -- will be those that adapt quickly to fast-changing consumer needs.”  Read more: Michael J. Casey - Why Web3 and the AI-Internet Belong Together  Which brings us to the spirit of this exercise: How could a savvy media website -- specifically a Web3-focused publication, such as CoinDesk -- smartly use AI in the future? Will us fleshy organic humans, with our pesky needs for sleep and food and paychecks, soon be replaced by machines?  And is it worth even opening this Pandora’s box? “I think there’s a first-order question for newsrooms to ask themselves, which is, ‘Why are we even using these tools in the first place? Is there a need?’” says Claire Leibowicz, head of the AI and Media Integrity Program at The Partnership on AI, a non-profit organization devoted to the mandate of responsible AI.  Leibowicz’s team concluded that ultimately, yes, AI can be leveraged as a tool to support sustainable journalism…with some important caveats. It could give a boost to small local newsrooms, for example, which might otherwise be headed for extinction. This doesn’t mean that AI should replace the human writers and editors. (I’ll cop to some bias. Full disclosure: I am a human writer.)  Let’s start with the range of journalistic functions that Leibowicz says AI should not be doing, which includes: Editorial decision-making, story curation, interviewing, and the writing of high-stakes stories. “We should take a step back and consider which stories are high stakes,” says Leibowicz. “Any story can be high-stakes, whether it’s pop culture or public health, and there should always be a human in the loop.”  That’s the theme from every expert I interviewed: AI can be an additive tool, but not a substitute for humans. There is a very real risk, of course, that AI could gobble up jobs anyway. It would be naive to ignore the possibility. But on a more optimistic note, Zain Kahn, who writes the AI-focused Superhuman newsletter, says that AI is “like having a very competent intern. It saves you from the work that you find to be drudgery anyways.”  The Partnership on AI has grouped the role for AI in newsrooms into three buckets, which we’ll adopt as a framework for this piece:  i. Lead Generation and Investigative Tools  ii. Content Creation and Distribution  iii. Audience Engagement  It’s early days for AI. (Everyone in crypto, of course, is familiar with the theme of “early days.”) There will surely be more use cases. And this list is hardly comprehensive. So with all of those disclaimers in mind, here are 12 ways that Robot Journos could help a Web3 newsroom:  Bucket I - Lead Generation and Investigative Tools  1. Spot trends and insights from large pools of data  Even the speediest of readers have trouble poring through 5,000 pages of financial documents, court papers, or on-chain transactions. AI can help with this, and it’s already happening.  “A classic example is the Pandora Papers,” says Leibowicz. Journalists used machine learning to help make sense of 11.9 million documents containing information on the secret offshore accounts of presidents and billionaires, which they used to break a Pulitzer-winning story.  2. Analyze social media trends  The question of “what to cover?” is at the heart of every newsroom. AI could suss out what the crypto community is most interested in. “There’s a world where AI tools are analyzing social media and trending topics, and we think both of those are vital,” says Leibowicz. But she adds a note of caution -- trending topics might actually mask the more important stories that no one’s talking about. “You don’t want to overlook these insights in favor of an algorithmic tool that’s deriving its data from the more macro picture,” she says.  Put differently, it’s the newsroom’s job to not simply react to what people are chattering about, but to seek out and report on the stories that people will be talking about. (See: CoinDesk breaking the FTX story.)  3. Help brainstorm story ideas and angles  While AI shouldn’t replace human brainstorming, it could be used as a jumping off point. Maybe it could get the creative juices flowing? “Why not have a fallible but potentially creative thought partner in coming up with lead generation ideas?” says Leibowicz.  This article was not written by AI. But will that be the case in the future?  Kahn, of the Superhuman newsletter, gets even more concrete. “Let’s say you want to write a piece and you’re not sure what the angle is,” says Kahn. “You can say, ‘Give me a list of 10 article ideas based off the text below.’” Many of those will be garbage, but only one needs to be useful.  Bucket II: Content Creation and Distribution  4. Write (low stakes) automated news articles  This is tricky and controversial. The consensus from the AI experts, generally, was that human beings should stick to actually writing the news. But Leibowicz suggests that in addition to the stories that would already be written, AI could be used to knock out “lower stakes” stories that would otherwise fall through the cracks. This is already happening. Leibowicz says the BBC used ChatGPT to write “7,000 or so hyper-localized news stories on British shopping trends,” which is an example of creating “stories that might otherwise be overlooked.”  Or maybe a local newsroom doesn’t have the bandwidth to cover every City Council meeting, but AI could scrape the transcripts and whip up some quick summaries. It’s easy to see the application in Web3. There are hundreds if not thousands of projects, conferences, and meet-ups that aren’t being covered by crypto media -- AI could help plug the gaps.  Read more: Michael J. Casey - What AI Governance Can Learn From Crypto’s Decentralization Ethos  Of course, what counts as “low stakes” vs. “high stakes”? Does AI have the expertise to understand this rapidly evolving field? Can AI differentiate between the authorities and the hucksters? None of these questions are easy.  5. Quickly translate technical papers for a mainstream audience  AI is good at analyzing dense, weedy academic papers and plucking out the insights. Kahn suggests feeding ChatGPT a long intimidating document -- a blockchain white paper, for example -- and then asking it for 20 key insights. Humans, ideally, would then vet this for accuracy and coherency.  6. Summarize crypto-adjacent news  “I don’t think you’re going to get replacements for reporters,” says Nathaniel Whittemore, who now hosts a daily AI podcast as well as his daily Web3 podcast. He imagines that traditional journalism -- with human interviews, reporting, and a dose of skepticism -- will help publications differentiate themselves from AI-reliant content farms.  That being said, Whittemore imagines that in the Web3 space specifically, AI could be used to quickly summarize crypto-adjacent news. “CoinDesk is the destination website for a lot of people in Web3,” says Whittemore. But CoinDesk is not the destination for all business or financial news. So for areas outside of its core competence, why not use AI as a service to the readers? What happens to the S&P 500 is not exactly CoinDesk’s bailiwick, but it’s of interest to most in the space. So Bloomberg or Wall Street Journal articles could be summarized and then linked to by AI, says Whittemore, as these are “sort of orthogonal to their interests, but relevant.”  7. Extract insights from long videos  There are already plug-ins for ChatGPT that allow you to instantly summarize and synthesize videos. Those will only get better. “Let’s say there’s a Bitcoin conference, and some dude’s yapping for two hours,” says Kahn. “Don’t watch the full two hours. Plug it in, and within a couple of minutes, you can get the whole transcript, or a few bullet points.”  And if there’s one thing the entire space can agree on, it’s that there’s a lot of yapping at crypto conferences.  Bucket III: Audience Engagement  8. Create AI chatbots  Francesco Rulli, an Italian businessman and philanthropist, has already used AI chatbots to quickly scale education platforms for young Afghanistan women. (Teaching financial empowerment, for example, when they lack that education at home.) He suspects that a Web3 website could do something similar. Rulli imagines that the AI could be trained on an accepted body of Web3 knowledge -- an archive of CoinDesk explainers, for example -- and could then serve as a dynamic guide for those learning about crypto. “You have a digital assistant that helps you to navigate,” says Rulli, “just like Virgil did with Dante in the inferno.”  What if instead of reading an article, you chat with a bot who tells you about the news?  Then there’s the wilder idea. Rulli envisions an AI chatbot that’s primarily about crypto education. But if we expand the idea further, perhaps chatbots could even change the very nature of news itself. What if instead of reading an article, you chat with a bot who tells you about the news? Getting even more out there, perhaps the AI Newsbot is able to hoover up data and insights and facts and stories, and dynamically answer any questions you might have about what’s happening in the world. This one is obviously more speculative. Back to the shorter-term utilities…  9. Facilitate better reader comments and interactions  Comments are the cesspool of the internet. AI could help clean this up. “The New York Times relies on something called Perspective API,” says Leibowicz, which uses machine learning to rank comments based on an automatic (if fallible) detection of how toxic they are.  10. Quickly transform content to publish across other platforms  Every newsroom struggles to keep up with the changing whims of content platforms -- one day Facebook is hot, the next day it’s Snapchat, the next day it’s Tik-Tok, soon it will be that trendy hologram start-up. AI could easily help publish across platforms. “You as a journalist can write this story, but maybe there are other modes of storytelling that can reach a different audience,” says Leibowicz. With a few clicks you could transform a 1,000-word article into a punchy Tik-Tok video.  11. Scale and automate social media  Once an article is finished, every editor I know dreads this lingering chore: Think of “call to action” tweets. This is not why anyone went to journalism school.  Here’s where AI shines. Kahn says that AI is already a powerful tool for quickly creating graphics and prompts for social media. Feed it an article, then ask it for 10 Twitter prompts. In the future, you’ll likely be able to automate the entire flow.  12. Customize the news reading experience  “The AI can actually match interests with information, and information with interests,” says Rulli. For example, he notes that he is Italian, so naturally he’s more interested in news from Italy. The AI could learn readers’ preferences and tailor the content to your appetites. Are you into NFTs? Great, then you’ll get more of that. Bitcoin maximalist? Then more bitcoin and Lightning network and Michael Saylor.  Final thoughts  The potential is dizzying. So are the risks and the caveats, such as: Concerns about data privacy, bias in AI, inaccuracy and hallucinations, an over-reliance on AI, security, the loss of a personal touch, legal murkiness, and ethical issues.  Many of these disclaimers were suggested by our final AI expert, who adds a note of caution: “As always, it's important to carefully consider the implications of AI integration and to use AI responsibly,” says the expert. “AI can be a powerful tool for improving efficiency and user experience, but it should be used in a way that respects user privacy, maintains accuracy, and upholds the site's values.” This AI expert, of course, is ChatGPT.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/07/12-ways-web3-media-could-embrace-ai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/46f04ce6557e18c2456ad3dd80576d7705e57c46-2059x1456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420270,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUemSr,1686164839,Bitcoin Halving Is Coming and Only the Most Efficient Miners Will Survive,"The bitcoin mining hashrate, a measure of computing power on the network, will likely decline dramatically a year from now, once rewards are halved.  Roughly every four years, the reward for successfully mining a bitcoin block is cut in half. This event, known as the halving, reduces inflationary pressure on bitcoin. Currently, rewards are 6.25 BTC per block ($170,000) and in April 2024 they will be reduced to 3.125 BTC per block ($85,000).  Currently, publicly listed miners mine at a cost of $10,000-$15,000 per bitcoin, said Wolfie Zhao, head of research at mining consultancy Blocksbridge. Once the halving happens, these costs will double, bringing miners’ breakeven point to $20,000-$30,000.  “If bitcoin isn’t seriously above $30,000, many of them could be mining at a gross loss,” he said.  Wall Street giant JPMorgan predicted the cost to mine bitcoin could rise as high as $40,000 after the halving.  With such a high cost of mining and absent any significant rally in the price of bitcoin, only the most cost efficient miners will survive, while others will be forced to shut down their operations.  “Energy cost and equipment efficiency will determine winners and losers post halving,” said Kerri Langlais, chief strategy officer at bitcoin miner TeraWulf (WULF).  Operators with higher production costs per bitcoin will have a more difficult time surviving the halving. According to data compiled by Zhao, Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG), Cipher Mining (CIFR) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) have the lowest costs of production, with Stronghold at $8,200, Cipher at $8,600 and Riot at $10,400 per bitcoin in the first quarter.  Efficiency matters  Considering that margins are likely to shrink, “miners have begun strategizing on capital preservation, fleet efficiency, and diversification,” investment bank Stifel’s analyst Bill Papanastasiou wrote in a note in late May.  Broadly speaking, the industry has turned its focus to the efficiency of operations and machines, as opposed to simply bringing as much hashrate online as possible, which was the case during the bull market of 2021.  Read more: A Huge Glut of Bitcoin Mining Rigs Is Sitting Unused in Boxes  Once the hashrate sees a “large drop off” immediately after the halving, we will see “very slow growth the following months as the efficient machines replace older machines, and machines change hands to lowest cost operators,” said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at mining services firm Luxor Technologies.  New investments  Moreover, investments in new machines have been “measured,” Papanastasiou said, given the uncertainty over the economics of mining for the upcoming year. The mining business already comes with a high cost of capital relative to other industries, double that of the precious metals sector, according to Luxor Technologies analyst Jaran Mellerud.  The lack of investment might seem counterintuitive considering that hashrate and difficulty—a measure of how easily miners can discover a block of bitcoin— has been consistently increasing in the past few months, despite the crypto bear market. Both metrics, key measures for the miners’ profitability, have been setting new all-time highs throughout 2023.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty’s Record Setting Streak Shows No Signs of Stopping  However, the rising hashrate can reflect economic conditions of several months ago. Because mining facilities and equipment take several months to be developed, the hashrate growth largely reflects investments made in previous periods.  Still, discussions for new developments have seen an uptick in 2023, said B Riley analyst Lucas Pipes in a note to investors. Investment in new buildings is subdued compared to 2021 levels, but relative to the autumn of 2022, when bitcoin prices were in their lows of around $15,000, the situation has improved for the industry.  A rally in the price of bitcoin or a major slump in energy prices could boost miners’ profitability, such that they don’t have to power off after the halving. Bloomberg Intelligence and Matrixport said that the halving has the potential to supercharge the price of bitcoin by as much as 81%.  “Historically, the rise in the price of BTC has outpaced the impact of the halving. Time will tell what happens in this cycle,” said Langlais.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/07/bitcoin-halving-is-coming-and-only-the-most-efficient-miners-will-survive,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ce9ba598e33e8aac5c82fd669aff6bd8f730fc8a-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The number one crypto by market cap could yet see crab-like price action, but the bulls could catch a break in the short term, according to an analyst. Related Reading: LDO Leads Top Coins, Registers 6% Gains In One Day As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $26,500 with a 2% profit in the last 24 hours. In the previous week, BTC recorded a 2% loss. In contrast, other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market cap recorded similar price action except for Binance Coin (BNB), which recorded a 14% loss over the same period. Positive Outlook For Bitcoin Price? According to analyst Ali Martinez, the price of Bitcoin could see further appreciation. Over the week, the cryptocurrency has retraced but stayed above critical resistance. Despite the unfavorable and uncertain macro conditions and regulatory environment, crypto market investors continue to battle to determine a clear direction. In this context, Martinez stated the following for BTC’s price using the TD Sequential Indicator, as seen in the chart below: The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the hourly chart, which could see $BTC rebound to $27,000 – $27,300. Still, #BTC must avoid an hourly close below $26,360 because it could lead to a downswing to $25,800. Despite the forecast, uncertainty could be the most critical factor, rendering the buy sequence ineffective. A break above the $27,000 to $27,300 levels could hint at a positive outlook for BTC traders in the short term. Conversely, $26,000 and $26,300 are still critical support levels, as the 200-weekly moving average (WMA) sits around that area. Bulls must defend this average to prevent the price from declining further, possibly into the low $20,000. As a positive sidenote, the spike in volatility in the previous trading sessions contributed to a cleanse in Open Interest (OI). Per a separate analysis, over $800 million in OI was wiped out as BTC took liquidity in both directions.

The Ether Trend Indicator signals a “significant uptrend.”  Long position traders remain willing to pay a fee to short position traders for bitcoin and ether, with this so-called funding rate indicating that crypto assets are bullishly charting their own course. Meanwhile, the CoinDesk Indices Ether Trend Indicator is signaling increased strength for the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

Funding rates ensure that spot and futures prices for crypto assets converge, as they do in traditional derivatives markets. Positive funding rates indicate positive investor sentiment, while negative rates indicate the opposite.  Funding rates for bitcoin and ether have been positive since May 14 and May 27, respectively. The positive sentiment comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed lawsuits against crypto exchange giants Binance and Coinbase for allegedly violating securities law, and targeted digital assets more broadly.  “We don’t need more digital currency.

42420280,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUemeD,1686163047,"NFT Lending Is Trending, Raising Concerns of ‘Predatory’ Platform Behavior","While non-fungible token (NFT) trading volumes slumped in May, the adjacent NFT lending space is blooming. And so far, reviews are mixed.  NFTfi – an evolving term for technology that sits at the intersection of NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi) – is on the rise. NFTfi encompasses a range of tools that aim to offer broader utility and liquidity for NFTs, including NFT collateralized loans, fractionalized tokens and renting or lending NFTs.  What started as a way to capitalize on the bull run of NFTs in 2021 has recently exploded in popularity as major Web3 players entered the market. In May, leading NFT marketplace Blur launched Blend (short for Blur Lending) – a peer-to-peer lending platform that allows users to borrow against their NFTs as collateral. The platform, which capitalizes on the popularity of Blur, quickly seized 82% of the entire NFT lending market share within its first three weeks.  Shortly after, other NFT lending platforms began to spring up. Binance launched its feature called Binance NFT Loan, which allows holders to secure ETH loans by using their NFTs as collateral. And Joseph Delong, the former CTO of DeFi protocol SushiSwap, launched Astaria, which utilizes a third party to facilitate its lending market.  Scores of traders have flocked to these platforms to begin “pawning” their tokens to earn yield. Additionally, traders who may not have been able to afford an expensive blue-chip NFT from collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) or Azuki can now lease these tokens for a fraction of the cost.  No doubt there are pros to participating in NFT lending, though the activity also comes with risks. Some Blur traders and NFTfi-native users called Blend’s lending mechanics into question and urged newer traders to educate themselves on how to borrow NFTs safely before diving in.  And while traders may support the idea of earning extra cash by lending out their dormant tokens, the risk of liquidation and concern over platform-specific lending mechanisms and decentralization among these platforms remains.  NFT lending benefits ‘lazy’ traders with big bounties  This rise of NFT lending platforms makes sense when you consider the current market conditions. Many NFT holders who purchased their tokens during the bull run are looking to earn some extra ETH in down markets. They can pawn their NFTs by leasing them to a trader who will pay to hold them over a specified period, earning the original owner some ETH. In turn, the borrower gets to join an NFT ecosystem or access certain perks they may not have been able to access otherwise.  For people like Polygon director of growth Hamzah Khan, who playfully describes his approach to NFT trading as “lazy,” lending can be lucrative.  “I just keep stuff long-term,” Khan told CoinDesk. “I don't use them daily … fundamentally, I like [NFT lending] because it gives me more capital.”  When asked about the potential dangers of NFT lending, Khan noted the risk of liquidation if the asset price drops, which can happen if the token price falls below 30-40%. However, he emphasized that he’s bullish on the growing industry and sees value in lending assets beyond the highly sought-after blue-chip NFTs.  “I have so many PFPs and I want to use them somewhere, but this vertical can become much bigger because homes can also be NFTs and mortgages can be can be denominated as ERC-721s,” said Khan. “I think people are people are severely underestimating how much we can do with NFTs.”  While NFT lending markets have primarily courted JPEG traders hoping to earn additional yield on their tokens, they operate similarly to lending markets outside the crypto space, like the housing market, that have the potential to onboard thousands more traders and companies to the Web3 landscape.  New traders are most at risk of ‘predatory’ behavior  Not all NFT lending platforms operate in the same way. Mason Cagnoni, chief operating officer of NFT lending platform Wasabi Protocol, and Karan Karia, vice president of business development at Wasabi, told CoinDesk that while the primary risk of NFT lending is early liquidation if a token’s price falls, Blend’s “down payment” feature allows a trader to make multiple payments on an NFT purchase over time, which can be tricky for traders new to trading NFTs.  “It's pitched as a ‘buy now, pay later’ that uses a perpetual lending on the back end, which is super predatory to the borrower,” said Karia. “Have you ever heard of a loan where you can get called instantly and you have 24 hours to repay? Like, the only person that does that is the mob.”  Cagnoni noted that new traders are more susceptible to engaging in risky behavior without fully understanding the consequences.  “Lending platforms were already in existence – if you go look at a Dune dashboard with the overlap of users, the Blend users are all new,” said Cagnoni. “Like, they're not NFTfi users.”  According to a recent report from blockchain analytics platform DappRadar, in Blend’s first three weeks, it amounted to 46.2% of Blur’s total trading volume. Cagnoni and Karian both explained that it’s likely so many new traders have flocked to Blend due to Blur’s points farming system. While Blur is not alone in offering rewards to its users for trading activity, its fast-paced growth and market dominance are often attributed to its successful BLUR token airdrops.  Karia suggested that once Blur users earn their long-sought-after tokens through an upcoming airdrop, current numbers may start to dwindle. He noted that in the greater lending ecosystem, the emerging platforms must put decentralization at the forefront of their mission to keep NFT lending as close to DeFi as possible.  “I think that we're all in this Web3 space because we believe in decentralization, and so having these decentralized open permission protocols that all tie into each other and create an actually open NFTfi system – I think that's a much more positive outlook,” said Karia. “That's what we're building towards, rather than just everything being siloed in one place, whether it be a centralized exchange like Binance, or a pseudo-centralized platform like Blur.”",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB | AIRDROP,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/06/07/nft-lending-is-on-the-rise-raising-concerns-of-predatory-platform-behavior,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a08f3544b1d06adadf1541b74f4eb25083ca9c5f-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420278,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUemc9,1686161348,Robinhood Joins Coinbase in Saying It Tried to 'Come In and Register' Like SEC Wanted,"With Coinbase (COIN) and Binance accused of running illegal exchanges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the latest industry testimony in the U.S. House of Representatives this week revealed that companies had desperately sought the agency’s help to properly register but were turned away.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler has a go-to crypto invitation to the firms that are operating without the agency’s approval and oversight, which he’s repeated so often it’s become a messaging mantra: They just need to come in and register.  Robinhood Markets' chief compliance lawyer told lawmakers that the popular trading firm was trying to register as a special-purpose broker for digital assets. Dan Gallagher, a former SEC commissioner who has spent a career in securities and corporate law, couldn’t get the agency to guide Robinhood into crypto compliance, though he said the staff seemed to want to help.  “When Chair Gensler at the SEC in 2021 said, ‘Come in and register,’ we did,” Gallagher said in his testimony. “We went through a 16-month process with the SEC staff trying to register a special purpose broker dealer. And then we were pretty summarily told in March that that process was over and we would not see any fruits of that effort.”  His story echoes longstanding complaints from Coinbase, whose top lawyer was also present at the House Agriculture Committee on Tuesday and is now facing an SEC lawsuit alleging his company offered unregistered securities and didn’t get approval as an exchange.  “When Coinbase has attempted to do just that, to talk about how we could register as a broker-dealer or an [alternative trading system] or even as a [national securities exchange] after months and months of discussion, we’re simply dismissed with no response or any counter proposal or ideas coming back from the SEC,” said Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer.  Gallagher said one of the regulator’s final sticking points for Robinhood was the lack of registration and disclosures from issuers of tokens that trade on the platform, and Gallagher argued there’s no way for his company to insist that outside issuers meet SEC demands.  Sen. Cynthia Lummnis (R-Wyo.) jumped into the debate with a tweet this week promoting her crypto bill: “The SEC has failed to provide a path for digital asset exchanges to register.”  The possible counterweight to this argument is the series of approvals of digital-assets broker-dealers by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), an industry-funded oversight arm created by the SEC. The brokerages, including Prometheum Ember Capital LLC, Bosonic Securities and OTC Markets Group, are officially approved to trade crypto securities, a category of assets whose borders aren’t yet well defined. Meanwhile, the companies trying to navigate a path as compliant crypto firms haven’t yet demonstrated a fully formed business model.  In comments after his agency’s enforcement actions, Gensler now seems to suggest the U.S. “doesn’t need more digital currency,” and that the industry must fix its compliance problems or he foresees a possibility of it “collapsing like a house of cards.”  However, this compliance dispute is no longer in the hands of the industry or the SEC but will be decided in the courts.

42420273,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUemVx,1686160484,The SEC Is Fighting the Last War,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) one-two punch of suits against Binance and Coinbase this week hardly came out of the blue. The question of how to regulate crypto exchanges has been at a high simmer for years, and while the specifics of their approach are eminently debatable, the SEC was bound to go after the big boys sooner rather than later.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But the messaging surrounding the suits makes the SEC’s recent moves seem reactive, political and frankly, just beneath the bluster, weak. Specifically, the SEC seems to be trying to put Coinbase and Binance into the same bucket as the frauds of 2022, such as Luna, Celsius and above all FTX. The SEC has been widely viewed as giving FTX deferential treatment before it was revealed as a massive fraud, so now it’s demonstrating that it really can be a hard-nosed regulator – it’s just doing so a couple of years late, and to the wrong targets.  Essentially, the SEC wants the public to see the current suits as part of a campaign against fraud. In reality, the suits represent a paternalistic attempt to keep people from making what the SEC views as the wrong kind of investments. That conflation is obviously deeply unfair, both to the companies being targeted – Coinbase especially – and to an American public that looks to the SEC for expertise.  Crimes and sins  The SEC, like all legislators and regulators, can’t be expected to distinguish between crimes that break the law, and sins that actually harm and exploit people. Regulators enforce codes, not morality itself – but that doesn’t mean such distinctions don’t exist.  The SEC’s core claim in its charges against Coinbase is simply that the exchange “has made calculated business decisions to make crypto assets available for trading in order to increase its own revenues, which are primarily based on trading fees from customers.”  [I]t’s hard to escape the sense that [the Binance and Coinbase lawsuits] are being framed as a do-over for the SEC’s and Gensler’s FTX missteps  There’s a complex debate to be had about whether Coinbase could have complied with the rules in the way the SEC says it should have. But the substance of the SEC claim here is that Coinbase broke the rules by creating a service that customers (including me) actually used, and then tried to make it better.  Whatever that is, to paraphrase Mae West, it ain’t no sin.  Yet the Coinbase charges are being tortuously represented as protecting investors against some manipulative, horrifying predator. SEC director of enforcement Gurbir S. Grewal, in a quote which the SEC has highlighted on social media, alleges that “Coinbase’s calculated decisions allowed it to earn billions … at the expense of investors by depriving them of the protections to which they were entitled.”  Binance, by contrast, does stand accused of a few things that look like genuine sins, particularly price manipulation that harmed customers. But other charges against Binance amount to a denial of its right to provide services that its customers clearly want.  If the protections Grewal wants include standards for reporting and transparency around assets similar to what exists in the stock market, it seems clear both U.S. and global exchanges would welcome such a regime.  But in fact, the SEC appears to think crypto exchanges are exploiting their customers simply by allowing them to do anything so foolish as buying cryptocurrency under their own free will.  ‘We don’t need more digital currency.’  The SEC’s suit against Coinbase in particular hinges on the moral presumption that cryptocurrency is inherently fraudulent and valueless. This allows them to paint Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong as the same as Sam Bankman-Fried in the public eye – despite the fact that the first has run a stable and trustworthy service for a decade, and the second was an incompetent boob with zero moral compass or basic mathematical ability.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler advanced that muddying agenda this morning on CNBC. He first made noises about the SEC’s supposed neutrality on asset quality. But he then launched into a sweeping and frankly boneheaded disquisition against crypto as such, declaring that ""we don't need more digital currency, we have digital currency. It's called the U.S. dollar. It's called the euro. It's called the yen. They're all digital right now.""  This is not just an embarrassing misrepresentation, but one Gensler must know the truth of. After all, he taught MIT students about blockchains. He can’t possibly actually believe there’s no distinction between the banking rails over which he and the rest of the U.S. government have incredibly oppressive, direct and politicized control, and monetary cryptocurrency networks they don’t and ultimately can’t control.  See also: Best Universities for Blockchain 2022: Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Gensler appears fully pot committed, in short, to misrepresenting the underlying facts to the public.  An embarrassment of entanglements  This is all best understood in the context of what happened in 2022. In fact, the SEC and other regulators performed pretty admirably in moving against frauds at the top of the crypto bubble. They put productive pressure on both Do Kwon’s Luna and Alex Mashinsky’s Celsius.  But Gary Gensler personally wound up embarrassingly exposed on Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX, above all because Gensler’s staff reportedly had ongoing discussions of crypto regulation with an FTX team. That intimacy may have kept them from seeing the fraud – at least one congressman publicly laid blame for FTX at Gensler’s feet. Though Gensler wasn’t involved, Sam Bankman-Fried’s appearances before Congress increased the impression that the FTX founder had special access to regulators.  Now, while there are legitimate reasons for the SEC’s charges against Binance and Coinbase, it’s hard to escape the sense that they are being framed as a do-over for the SEC’s and Gensler’s FTX missteps. But that doesn’t mean they’re actually the same thing, and misleading the public to that effect may wind up undermining Gensler’s position in the long run.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,David Z.

42420286,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUemkP,1686160026,The Petrodollar and Its Discontents Point to Bitcoin's Role in the Financial Future,"Over the past several years, and with accelerating frequency in the past six months, oil producing nations like Russia and Saudi Arabia have signaled their intent to break with the so-called “petrodollar” system. The petrodollar system, which emerged starting in roughly 1973, is the nearly uniform use of U.S. dollars to denominate, and often settle, worldwide oil trades.  David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.  Though it is sometimes mistaken for a formal rules-based system, the petrodollar is better understood as one aspect of the broader role of the dollar as a global reserve currency, and the resulting “exorbitant privilege” the U.S. enjoys. Specifically, historians regard the petrodollar as one of the most important consequences of the transition from the Bretton Woods framework for global finance, which centered on a managed gold standard, to the more decentralized and market-based neoliberal money system that supplanted it.  Signals of a reduction in petrodollar trade have added to persistent anxieties about the dollar’s reserve currency status, which is also currently under pressure thanks to inflation. An erosion of the dollar’s reserve status could seriously undermine U.S. debt financing and other economic fundamentals.  That’s why some recent news in oil markets has raised anxiety about the dollar. In March, it was reported that Saudi Arabia and China were accelerating talks to price and settle oil contracts in Yuan via a Shanghai petroleum exchange. China has also conducted talks with Brazil, a significant crude oil exporter, about ditching the dollar. Indian traders have reportedly settled some Russian oil purchases in rubles and dirham, the currency of the United Arab Emirates. That all sounds very worrisome for the dollar, and for U.S. financial hegemony.  But a deeper dive suggests much of this is empty posturing – not because the world loves the dollar or the U.S., but because no other national fiat currency is positioned to supplant their role in the system. At the same time, the petrodollar system has given oil exporters large and sometimes troubling influence over the United States via investment. Viewed on a long enough horizon, the deadlock highlights potential demand for a truly neutral, global currency not subject to politicized manipulation by a single issuer.  In short, the tensions at the heart of the petrodollar system point towards a solution that looks something like Bitcoin.  Power politics? Or just economics?  Because the petrodollar system emerged very soon after the Nixon administration ended the Bretton Woods regime of gold-backed U.S. dollars, the two are sometimes viewed as analogues. One widespread but reductive characterization describes dollars as “backed” by oil starting in the 1970s, the way they once were by gold. This framing is often accompanied by a conspiratorial view that the system emerged through a backroom arms-for-debt financing deal between the Nixon administration and Saudi Arabia.  But “none of this was a conspiracy,” according to economic historian David Spiro. “Whatever they refer to as the petrodollar standard, it doesn’t exist. It shows no understanding of the international monetary system and its goals.” Spiro’s 1999 book “The Hidden Hand of American Hegemony: Petrodollar Recycling and International Markets” is one of the definitive texts on the subject.  The U.S. certainly engaged in deceptive and secretive behavior. But this was not in pursuit of a multi-decade agenda to cement the dollar’s reserve status with an oil deal. Rather, the immediate burning issue was a global trade imbalance and potential resulting instability. As the price of oil rose in the early 1970s, oil exporters, and Arab nations in particular, began to enjoy huge trade surpluses. Those trade surpluses left them with large and growing piles of cash, of various sorts, and parked in an increasingly far-flung web of banking institutions.  In a worst-case scenario, if those oil earnings didn’t get back into the global capital system, credit markets could have seized up and collapsed. The most conspiratorial view of the petrodollar system hangs on the genuinely secretive U.S. efforts to help solve the issue. The fate of the credit system and funding for U.S. debt, far more than the future dominance of the dollar, was the priority when Nixon administration Treasury Secretary William Simon traveled to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in 1974 to pitch the Saudis on investing in U.S. Treasuries.  Simon offered to let the Saudis bid on U.S. Treasury bonds via the so-called “add-on” system, rather than via the standard Treasury auction. This gave the Saudis better pricing, but more importantly, it made the purchases secret. This secrecy, according to Spiro, was necessary because the U.S. was breaking a trade agreement with Europe by cutting a bilateral deal to recruit Saudi capital. The subsequent Saudi purchases of a total of $117 billion dollars’ worth of Treasuries was kept secret from the world until 2016, when Bloomberg reporter Andrea Wong uncovered Saudi holdings through a Freedom of Information Act request.  The yen, yuan, ruble, and euro all have individual shortcomings for filling that role  But many experts also believe that the Saudi-U.S. deal included an unrecorded agreement for the U.S. to aid in Saudi defense. Some historians argue that the two Iraq Wars were pursued in service to a clandestine Saudi-U.S. defense pact.  Petrodollars and the neoliberal order  Spiro argues that this U.S. deal amounted to America using political and military leverage to maintain economic hegemony. His views contrast, though, with another line of thinking that claims Saudi investments were guided by market forces, not by U.S. power. According to this so-called “institutionalist” view, the petrodollar system essentially emerged because dollar assets were appealing places to put capital. This line of thinking aligns with so-called “neoliberal” ideas about the power of free-market forces in global finance, in contrast to the more managed gold-standard monetary regime.  One piece of evidence for this naturalist, free-market interpretation is financial data predating Simon’s deal. Dollar assets held by oil-exporting countries in European banks stood at $0.8 billion in 1964, according to 2009 research by Christopher Kopper, but had rocketed to $10 billion by 1972 – well before the Nixon deal. This is even more striking because the U.S. in 1963 had begun passing rules intended to reduce U.S. bank lending to foreign borrowers.  Those investments rose not because of any deal, then, but despite formal barriers, seemingly attracted by the fundamentals of the dollar assets themselves. The desire to skirt U.S. barriers, in fact, led to an offshore market for dollar bonds and deposits in Europe, sold via London- and sometimes Luxembourg-based banks and branches. These became known as “Eurodollar” assets. This financial market was already developed, then, when a long-term climb in oil demand and prices began in 1973, leaving oil exporters with even more money to invest.  The idea that U.S. defense of Saudi is part of a secret oil deal is also debatable. An early mutual defense pact between the U.S. and Saudi was signed in 1951, more than two decades before William Simon went to Jeddah. Moreover, the broader Cold War context may be as or more significant than oil per se: before the 1990s, Saudi’s hereditary monarchs wanted good U.S. relations as a bulwark against both domestic insurrection and the nearby Soviet Union.  And whatever the public or private terms of the U.S.-Saudi relationship, it never had juridical power over the broader oil market. Economist Dean Baker wrote in 2009, for instance, that “oil producers are free to construct whatever terms they wish for selling their oil, and many often agree to payment in other currencies.” In fact, even the Saudi relationship has had to be shored up occasionally, as in a 1978 meeting when Saudis reiterated their commitment to the dollar.  The paranoia of global finance  Questions about the petrodollar system’s origins are important because they help us understand its future. At the highest level, if U.S. political maneuvering was a key determiner of where petrodollar surpluses wound up invested, that should make it relatively simple to escape the petrodollar system through similar political deals, such as those discussed among India, Russia, and China. By contrast, if market forces are the main factor pushing oil surpluses into dollar assets, and in turn maintaining the dollar’s reserve status, it’s far less plausible that even a command economy can will an alternative into existence.  On this count, the neoliberal explanation seems to be winning: political attempts at creating a petrodollar alternative have been fizzling for decades. Current worries about Russia and China cutting deals with Saudi Arabia are easily recognizable in this 2009 account of similar discussions, which ominously warned “an extraordinary transition from dollar markets within nine years.”  Obviously, that didn’t happen. Economist Dean Baker characterized those 2009 fears of a game-changing anti-dollar deal as something that “would make a good plot for a Hollywood movie, but it doesn’t make much sense as economics.” According to that view, meetings and discussions amongst non-U.S. oil trading nations can hardly hope to bend the monumental economic forces that make the dollar the preferred instrument for global trade in general, not just for oil.  Global finance theater  Even if a political exit from the petrodollar were possible, even David Spiro doesn’t think the current Saudi-China-Russia constellation has much chance of accomplishing it.  “I think the Saudis are trying to become more of an international player and power,” Spiro told me. “And they’re trying to move away from the U.S.” In other words, having meetings with China about pricing oil in yuan is something like a threat of economic blackmail from Saudi Arabia, aimed less at actually transitioning away from the dollar than at influencing U.S. monetary and foreign policy in the short term.  But there’s been little evidence so far that this kind of threatening gesture is effective, and Spiro is deeply skeptical of the upside for the Saudis. “The crown prince is young and ambitious and not terribly well-educated about some of this stuff.”  There’s rich historical irony here. Many Americans in the 1970s were anxious that “the Arabs, and the Saudis, in particular, could use their money, as well as their oil, as an economic weapon,” as Judith Miller summarized in 1979, “And throw the American markets into chaos by abruptly liquidating assets and transferring them abroad.” That exact scenario was even explored in a popular novel, “The Crash of ’79.”  But it has become clear that holding U.S. debt doesn’t actually translate to much power. This was demonstrated quite clearly with the 2016 revelation of Saudi holdings of U.S. treasuries. The secret had been kept by U.S. administrations for decades on national security grounds before Bloomberg’s Andrea Wong sent her Freedom of Information Act request and finally got the numbers. Spiro speculates that information was finally released by the U.S. as a strategic ploy in a then-simmering conflict between Saudi and U.S. officials over legislation connecting Saudi to 9/11 .  “The Saudis made some sort of stupid comment threatening to sell off their treasuries,” Spiro recounts. “It was an idle threat. But … [Wong] requested the information and the request happened to coincide with the Saudi’s making this stupid comment, and the Treasury released the data.”  We have the capability now to do something entirely different: to build a system that’s more genuinely fair, precisely because no one controls it  The released data showed $117 billion in Saudi holdings of Treasuries. That’s hardly a pittance, but it was far smaller than the $750 billion the Saudis claimed to be prepared to sell. That gap may result from not counting the holdings of quasi-governmental investment funds - or the Saudis may simply have been exaggerating their holdings in pursuit of leverage. Economists have argued, however, that neither number represents a serious threat to the market for U.S. Treasuries, because aggregate demand for Treasuries remains strong.  In other words, despite the worst fears of the 1970s or 2023, the U.S. debt held by Saudi Arabia doesn’t seem to actually offer them terribly much in the way of leverage.  Petrodollars forever: Why the system can’t change  To crudely synthesize the historical debate over petrodollars, it doesn’t seem a stretch to accept that both U.S. power politics and liberalized economic forces contributed to the emergence of the petrodollar system. But in the present day, it seems the economic reality of the dollar trumps any politicking. As so often seems the case in a supposedly free-market system, there simply is no alternative.  China’s yuan and Russia’s ruble offer none of the liquidity and convertibility of the dollar, and add risks to boot. China’s yuan does not trade freely, making it unusable as a reserve currency. China’s rulers have also recently demonstrated their willingness to compromise property rights and reshape laws on the fly. Russia’s economy, already a dog before the Ukraine invasion, is flailing under international wartime sanctions, making its currency utterly laughable as a dollar replacement.  In short, threats of a shift away from the dollar have strategic political benefits for the likes of Saudi Arabia, but that doesn’t mean they’ll be stockpiling rubles and Russian equity any time remotely soon.  Officials in the Middle East agree with that analysis, if quietly, according to Bloomberg columnist Javier Blas. On the question of converting to a petroyuan (to say nothing of a petroruble), Blas reports, Blas says oil exporters are skeptical: “The greenback is freely convertible, the yuan isn’t; the dollar is liquid, the yuan isn’t. That’s the polite version; the more candid answers sounded even more emphatic about the absurdity of turning to a managed currency produced by an opaque and unpredictable financial machine.”  In short, while many global actors resent the privilege it represents, the “petrodollar” isn’t going anywhere, anytime soon. More generally, the dollar is unlikely to be supplanted by another fiat currency for global trade more generally. The current wave of posturing by Saudi, Russian, and Chinese officials is aimed at enhancing those nation’s leverage and influence, but won’t alter the deadlock of dollar finance.  Money talks: Petrodollars and venture capital  While Arab holdings of U.S. debt don’t seem to intimidate the U.S. government, reinvested petrodollars do have seemingly serious sway over another powerful block: U.S. businesses on the hunt for capital.  This is nothing new: back in the 1970s, for instance, AT&T took a $650 million loan from the Saudi central bank (That’s over $2.8 billion in 2023 dollars). But for a time, the murder of Jamal Khashoggi made Saudi entanglements in particular a serious reputational risk.  Khashoggi was a complicated figure rumored to have intelligence ties, but his most public role was as a journalist for the Washington Post. That made his gruesome dismemberment on the orders of Saudi Crown Prince Muhammed Bin Salman particularly emblematic of the Kingdom’s much broader illiberalism, which also includes the oppression of women and labor practices sometimes indistinguishable from slavery. For years after Khashoggi’s murder, U.S. firms stayed away from the Saudi’s Future Finance Initiative (FFI) summit, also known as Davos in the Desert.  But rising U.S. interest rates over the past year seem to have made morals an unaffordable luxury for some – in particular, U.S. venture capital funds. Last year’s Davos in the Desert was viewed as a kind of return to polite society for the Saudis, attracting JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, among other U.S. financiers dependent on Saudi money. At a recent smaller event backed by Saudi’s sovereign wealth fund, a16z cofounder Ben Horowitz offered his belly like a subservient dog, declaring Saudi a “startup country,” and that “Saudi has a founder; you don’t call him a founder, you call him his royal highness.”  This is pathetic stuff, but it’s merely a small index of the much deeper perverse influence that recycled petrodollars have on U.S. investing. Petrodollar reinvestment has been a huge factor in the recent startup ecosystem – and arguably, not for the better. Mohammed bin Salman (pre-Khashoggi) contributed nearly half the capital to SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son has joked that his meeting with MBS amounted to raising “$1 billion per minute.”  But as they say, easy come, easy go. The Vision Fund became emblematic of the dangers of too much money, with its winner-take-all approach to helping companies like Uber buy market share with subsidies instead of worrying about profits. The approach hasn’t quite panned out, and the Vision Fund since its founding has underperformed the boring old S&P 500. Headline Vision Fund investments like WeWork, Uber, Opendoor and Doordash have been yawning sinkholes for capital, and are now in zombie-like states of perpetual unprofitability.  Saudi does get something in return, though: a veneer of legitimacy. In 2018, Masayoshi Son, former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, and Y Combinator’s Sam Altman (now focused on OpenAI) were all named to the “global advisory board” for NEOM, a proposed “smart city” to be built in the Saudi desert. NEOM is a pet project of Muhammed bin Salman, and reflects the same high-concept, low-IQ approach as the Softbank investments. Sam Altman quickly resigned from the board, but Kalanick and Son seem to be ride or die for the Saudis, who reportedly invested $400 million in Kalanick’s CloudKitchens startup.  All this paints the picture of a startup ecosystem grown fat and lazy on the perpetual Arab petrodollar spigot. The job of VCs like Ben Horowitz is increasingly not to build companies that work, but to do a Sheherezade act for one Prince or another, spinning never-ending stories about the future thrilling enough that the prince spares their lives (or at least their extremely lucrative jobs) for another day. And while the a16z crew is the most transparently thirsty, they’re far from alone. Sanabil Investments, the venture arm of Saudi’s sovereign wealth fund, recently revealed ties to 40 U.S. venture firms.  Though hardly comparable in scale or impact, these compromises could be the venture capitalists’ equivalent of the Iraq invasions, pursued to keep the Saudis, their allies and their money happy.  As the New York Times’ Judith Miller wrote both presciently and ironically back in 1979, “If the [1973] oil embargo was the stick, the [Arab] investments are the carrot — some would say drug, on which [the U.S.] has become increasingly dependent.”  The bitcoin option  While the specifics of Arab petrodollar reinvestment may be toxic, the existence of trade imbalances as such isn’t necessarily bad. In a capitalist global trade system, there will be periods of economic dominance by one force or another. In the postwar environment, the United States has enjoyed both structural advantages as a sole economic superpower, and a real competitive edge, particularly in technology. That gives the rest of the world plenty of motive to give Uncle Sam loans.  The problem is that the same economic titan also effectively controls the global money supply, in which its own debts are denominated. Through that control, the U.S. also substantially controls global monetary infrastructure, giving it significant power to change the rules of the game to suit itself.  The Arab world may be making unhappy noises about the petrodollar system largely in an attempt to raise its global standing, but the other major players in the drama have more concrete concerns about being trapped in a dollar-denominated world. For Russia, there was the recent humiliation of having $600m worth of foreign reserves seized by the West. China, as a major holder of U.S. debt, is likely unhappy to see recent U.S. money-printing devalue its holdings.  But even focused and coordinated efforts to exit the petrodollar system, and the broader dollar reserve system, have failed. In large part, it seems that’s because there simply is no viable alternative. The yen, yuan, ruble, and euro all have individual shortcomings for filling that role.  But more fundamentally, any single dominant currency would simply reproduce most of the same problems that dollar dominance has, such as risk of debasement.  This finally brings us to the case for Bitcoin. Or perhaps more accurately, the case for a neutral, global money – of which Bitcoin is the best existing example. The non-U.S. nations trying to leave the petrodollar system seem to at least partly share this view: the 2009 discussions revolved around creating a new unit of trade consisting of a “basket” of various currencies, with the seeming goal of preventing dominance by any one national scrip. That plan didn’t pan out, perhaps because the creation of such a synthetic instrument would itself be almost endlessly contentious.  Bitcoin has the advantage of already existing, without formal ties to any national currency. Of course, since we’re talking about deficits, adoption for global trade would involve denominating debt in bitcoin terms instead of dollars – which might be a hard sell given persistent volatility.  That’s just one of what would certainly be endless technical and administrative hurdles and nuances in the transition away from dollar dominance. It doesn’t seem likely to happen any time soon, and by the time it comes to fruition, a different kind of neutral ledger and unit of account may well have supplanted Bitcoin itself.  But if nothing else, those who feel they’re under the heel of the petrodollar should look to Bitcoin as a model. It’s not enough to simply move away from the dollar to another fiat currency, even if a viable option existed. We have the capability now to do something entirely different: to build a system that’s more genuinely fair, precisely because no one controls it.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET,David Z.

The lawsuit claims that Coinbase has knowingly allowed the trading of cryptocurrencies that could be classified as securities, despite having internal measures to identify such assets. This development, along with other legal issues and a decline in trading volume and user activity, makes the outlook for Coinbase Global and its investors increasingly bleak. 2023 is proving to be a really dark and painful time for Coinbase Global ( COIN ) and its shareholders. The most recent development that came out that will likely have a deleterious effect on the company was revealed on June 6th. In short, the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) decided to file a lawsuit against the company, claiming, amongst other things, that the firm is operating as an unregistered broker-dealer and that it is engaged in a variety of unlawful activities. In response to this development, shares of the company closed down 12.1% for the day, but not before initially falling as much as 21%. In my mind, this further solidifies why investors and market participants should be bearish about the company. In addition to operating in a space that I believe has little to no true long-term value, the company now has to deal with a legal crisis that could prove very costly in the long run. An awful but unsurprising development On June 6th, shares of Coinbase Global plunged, dropping in response to a lawsuit filed by the SEC. In the lawsuit, the SEC alleges a number of issues regarding the company. As I mentioned already, one allegation is that the company is essentially operating as an unregistered broker-dealer. In addition to this, they claim that Coinbase Global commingled funds, unlawfully operated as an exchange, and even provided clearing house functions that it should not have given its registration status or lack thereof. This is not the only legal issue that the company is facing right now. Multiple states are also putting pressure on it and other firms. Alabama, for instance, recently gave Coinbase Global 28 days to justify why it shouldn't be forced to stop selling unregistered securities in that state. Alabama is one of just ten different state securities regulators that are part of a joint enforcement action against the company. However, this article will focus not on the state issues, but instead on the federal. The entire lawsuit itself is just over 100 pages. So the purpose of this article will be to zero in on some of the key facets that investors should be aware of. In the very opening of the lawsuit, the SEC summarizes the core issues rather eloquently. They start by saying that, ""the Coinbase Platform merges three functions that are typically separated in traditional securities markets-those of brokers, exchanges, and clearing agencies. Yet, Coinbase has never registered with the SEC as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency, thus evading the disclosure regime that Congress has established for our securities markets. All the while, Coinbase has earned billions of dollars in revenues by, among other things, collecting transaction fees from investors whom Coinbase has deprived of the disclosures and protections that registration entails and thus exposed to significant risk."" I am no lawyer. But I do have extensive experience in the securities industry. In addition to the analysis that I perform on a daily basis, I ran a state-registered investment advisory firm for nine years. And I am in the process of setting up another. I have explored a great deal when it comes to setting up a broker-dealer as well, given that some of my future endeavors might involve such a legal structure. At the core of the argument, as I see it at least, is that Coinbase Global would not have any of these as regulatory problems if the cryptocurrencies that they have on their platform cannot be classified as securities. Author In my mind, a security is ultimately backed by some asset, or it is backed by something that is backed by an asset. But that is not the framework in which the SEC operates. Thanks to a Supreme Court ruling, there is a very specific test that's utilized called the Howey Test. This can be seen in the image above. At the end of the day, all four of these must be answered with a yes in order for an asset to be classified as a security. Given the nature of cryptocurrency, there has been a tremendous amount of debate over what is an asset and what is not. Regulators, such as SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, have long claimed , for instance, that Bitcoin is not a security according to the Howey Test. This is because Bitcoin does not involve funds flowing into a common enterprise, there is no promoter or issuer of it, and because an investor's success ends up not being reliant on the efforts of other parties. But now there are 10s of thousands of cryptocurrencies out there. And each one has some degree of differentiation. In its enforcement action that it filed against Binance the other day, the SEC listed 61 different cryptocurrencies that it considers to be securities. Meanwhile, in the lawsuit against Coinbase Global, the Commission listed 13 different cryptocurrencies that Coinbase Global facilitates trading for that it considers to be securities. To be very clear, they did say that list is non-exhaustive. I won't go through the entire list, but I will give a couple of examples. The first that I have decided to mention is SOL, or Solana. For those not familiar, SOL is the native token of the Solana blockchain. Between May of 2018 and early March of 2020, the creator of SOL, Solana Labs, filed multiple forms with the SEC in which it claimed that offers it was making to investors that involved the issuance of SAFTs (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) In exchange for capital to build out its business, involved the sale of securities. Specifically, the securities in question would be the SOL that the SAFTs we're supposed to convert into. The company ended up going on to raise hundreds of millions of dollars, including $314 million in August of 2021. While SOL was very open in that it viewed its offerings as offerings of securities, this was not the case with every example provided by the SEC. An example on the opposite end of the spectrum was DASH, which is the native token of the Dash blockchain. In short, the Dash platform operates as a financial transactions service for its customers. Earlier this year even, the SEC asserted that DASH was a security, an allegation that the official DASH community took significant issue with and addressed on Twitter. At the core of the SEC's argument is that its Masternodes (a subset of users who 'purportedly' run the network and that provide extra services through it) not only exert significant control over the platform, but also that they have made statements that would lead outsiders and investors to view DASH as an investment that they should expect to profit from. One such statement involved the fact that the platform's mission is ""to provide greater financial freedom by delivering and improving financial solutions which are secure, reliable, decentralized, and usable for all."" If it were just a case of Coinbase Global accidentally allowing some securities onto its platform in an environment that nobody will say is crystal clear, this would probably be a rather small matter. But the problems are bigger than that. Back in late 2016, according to the SEC, Coinbase Global released a document on its website called, 'A Securities Law Framework for Blockchain Tokens' That talked about the Howey Test and that even acknowledged that some cryptocurrencies or tokens might very well pass it. The company followed this up in late 2018 with its publication of its 'Coinbase Crypto Asset Framework'. This framework included with it a listing application form so that crypto asset issuers and promoters who are hoping to make their cryptocurrencies available on the company's platform could apply. Many of the questions asked in the application could be used, according to the SEC, to perform a Howey analysis. From this, the company eventually went on in 2019 to create its own Crypto Rating Council, which created its own test to measure the likelihood that any particular cryptocurrency would pass the Howey Test. On its own, this is perfectly fine. However, the company found itself under pressure to grow more rapidly and, along the way, it ended up onboarding onto its platform even cryptocurrencies that ranked as high risk according to this new framework. In one case, a team at the company even allegedly advised a cryptocurrency issuer about statements that had been made regarding a cryptocurrency that could elevate its risk. And they even went so far as to advise that issuer to change certain language that they use when describing the asset and to avoid making problematic statements moving forward. What this all shows to me is not only did Coinbase Global understand the law, they purposely avoided compliance with it and blatantly disregarded their own internal measures that were telling them that certain cryptocurrencies were almost certainly classifiable as securities. There are other issues as well. For starters, Coinbase Global has gone so far as to create what it calls its Coinbase Staking Program and to market it as an investment opportunity. On its website, for instance, the company even claimed at one point that users who would like to stake their cryptocurrency can 'earn on as much' as they want. Examples of annual yields as high as 7.5%, plus bonuses from time to time, have proven to be useful marketing initiatives. Staking on its own may not be all that problematic from a regulatory perspective. But it is a problem when the cryptocurrencies being staked are classified as securities. And according to the SEC, the five stakeable assets that Coinbase Global provided users an opportunity with passed the Howey test in large part because the Coinbase Staking Program was classifiable as an investment contract. Furthermore, this is an issue because the individual cryptocurrencies or tokens included in the Coinbase Staking Program are segregated, pooled, and staked by asset class. But each individual cryptocurrency is not further segregated by account holder. So for instance, all SOL units that are staked are held in the same account. This is only one example of a commingling of assets. According to the SEC, commingling occurs across the Coinbase Platform, as well as through both its Prime and Wallet features. For those not familiar, Coinbase Prime is described by management as a 'prime broker for digital assets', while the Coinbase Wallet serves as an individual wallet that routes orders through third party crypto asset trading platforms in order to access liquidity outside of the company's platform. To me, this is especially problematic when we talk about Coinbase Prime. Based on the data provided, Coinbase Prime serves as a full-service prime brokerage platform that provides customers with institutional grade trading activities and other features. But to use the word 'brokerage' without actually being one seems to me to not just tiptoe on the line of fraud, but to pass over it. Pain just keeps piling on Truth be told, I have no idea how this legal debacle will play out. The allegations being made by the SEC are damning and some of the quotes and other pieces of evidence that they provide look incredibly incriminating. But the picture most certainly looks awful in the grand scheme of things. In order to rectify this situation, one avenue that Coinbase Global could explore is to remove any questionable assets from its platform. Coinbase Global There is still uncertainty as to whether Ethereum should ultimately be classified as a security or not. It currently accounts for 25.6% of the $124.4 billion worth of crypto assets on the company's platform. Bitcoin is even larger, accounting for 44.7%. The miscellaneous crypto assets that consist of all of the identified problem tokens, not to mention countless others that might not be classified as securities, only account for 28.9% of these assets. Author - SEC EDGAR Data Unfortunately, such a maneuver couldn't come at a worse time. Even though customer crypto assets on the company's platform are up 65% year over year, a lot of the other metrics provided by management look painful. Revenue in the first quarter of 2023, for instance, came in at $772.5 million. That's down substantially from the $1.17 billion reported one year earlier. This decline has been driven by a couple of factors. For starters, the trading volume on the company's platform has been plummeting. In the first quarter of 2022, it came out to $309 billion. In the first quarter of this year, the number was less than half that at $145 billion. The MTUs (monthly transacting users) are also down, having fallen from 9.2 million last year to 8.4 million today. By definition, this all indicates that not only are there fewer users, but also that the users who have remained have cut down significantly on their trading activities. Author - SEC EDGAR Data To be fair, management has done well to reduce costs substantially. Even with $144.5 million of restructuring costs on the company's income statement for the first quarter of this year, its net loss of $78.9 million was far better than the $429.7 million net loss the company experienced one year earlier. Operating cash flow went from negative $91.4 million to positive $463.1 million, while the adjusted figure for this that ignores changes in working capital improved from negative $17.1 million to positive $147.8 million. And finally, EBITDA for the company expanded from only $20 million to $284 million. While these bottom line results are great to see, I believe that the long-term outlook for the company is anything but great. As I have written about before, Bitcoin on its own is very nearly worthless. Once the market does eventually come to terms with this, the company will face pain the likes of which regulators are unlikely to be able to inflict upon it. I won't make a blanket statement about cryptocurrencies in general. I believe some of them likely do have some true value to them. But with such a large portion of customer assets in the form of Bitcoin, and with the prospect of the company likely having to unload at least some of the 253 other crypto assets that it had as of the end of the most recent quarter, it's unclear exactly what the fallout will be. Takeaway At this moment, the picture for Coinbase Global and its investors looks awful. Since I wrote a bearish article on the company a little over a year ago, shares have dropped another 3.9% while the S&P 500 has increased by 8.9%. Honestly, I'm surprised that the drop hasn't been worse. This latest development spells significant costs for the company moving forward. And I'm not just talking regulatory fees. Legal costs will be a problem, further lawsuits will likely bubble up, and the company is already dealing with some issues outside of this as I mentioned previously. All combined, I have no problem downgrading the company further from the 'sell' that I had it at previously to a 'strong sell' to reflect my view that the stock should significantly underperform the broader market from here on out.",NEGATIVE,SOL,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4610047-coinbase-global-is-in-serious-trouble?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13592048.jpeg

The BTC-U.S. dollar trading pair on Binance.US jumped as high as $28,800 earlier on Wednesday morning, some $1,700 higher than the average price across other exchanges at that time, data shows. Recently, the BTC-USD pair was changing hands at $27,900, while the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX), which feeds from prices on multiple exchanges, stood at around $26,400. The difference represents an almost 6% price premium on Binance.US.  The ETH-USD pair was trading at $1,932, compared to the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX) at $1,840. Tether’s USDT, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, changed hands at 6 cents above its typical $1 peg on the exchange.  The price anomaly developed as the SEC was seeking to freeze assets on the exchange, according to a court document filed on Tuesday. This followed the agency’s Monday lawsuit against Binance, CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and Binance.US, alleging multiple federal securities law violations.  The unusually high price premium is a sign of deteriorating liquidity on the platform as traders are retreating in anticipation of a potential asset freeze, according to Clara Medalie, research director of digital asset data firm Kaiko.  “Market makers are wary ahead of this double blow to Binance's U.S. entity, and are removing liquidity from the exchange's order books in anticipation of a possible freeze,” Medalie said in a note. “No trader wants to get caught with their assets stuck on an exchange.”  BTC and ETH market depth – the ability to absorb large sell and buy orders without moving the price significantly – on Binance.US has dropped significantly since Monday’s lawsuit, Kaiko data shows.  Binance.US announced Wednesday that it will remove a plethora of USDT, BTC and BUSD trading pairs from its Advanced Trading platform and will pause its over-the-counter (OTC) trading service. The move will allow the exchange to concentrate liquidity to the remaining asset pairs and services.  It is not the first time that Binance.US users experienced price discrepancies. In May, the BTC-USD pair traded $650 higher on that exchange than on Coinbase, as crypto market watchers contemplated a possible SEC crackdown and U.S.-based market makers began scaling down operations there.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/07/bitcoin-ether-trade-at-premiums-on-binanceus-as-investors-flee-following-sec-actions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/daf10318cb93f32c353a1641ebbc2e6f5fcac4fe-2134x1264.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Robinhood Markets Inc. is reportedly reassessing the cryptocurrencies it offers on its platform after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance. On Tuesday, the company’s chief legal officer, Dan Gallagher, told Congress that it is “actively reviewing” the SEC’s analysis “to determine what, if any, action to take.” A former SEC commissioner, Gallagher, testified before the House Agriculture Committee during a meeting on digital assets. SEC Believes Several Popular Cryptocurrencies are Unregistered Securities In its lawsuit against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao, the SEC alleged that popular cryptocurrencies such as Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) are unregistered securities.

13590305,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536848,1686153625,"Bitcoin Realized Loss Remains Low Despite Volatility, What Does This Mean?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin realized loss metric has stayed at a low value recently, despite the volatility that the coin has experienced. Bitcoin Realized Loss Continues To Be At A Relatively Low Value According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, investors realized just $112 million in losses during the recent plummet in the cryptocurrency’s value. The “entity-adjusted realized loss” is a metric that measures the total amount of loss (in USD) that Bitcoin investors have recently been realizing on the blockchain. Whenever a coin sits still on the network for a while (meaning that it hasn’t been transferred to another address) and the price goes above or below the value at which it was acquired, the coin is said to gain an “unrealized profit/loss.” When such a coin that’s carrying an unrealized profit or loss is finally moved or sold on the blockchain, the profit/loss it was carrying previously then becomes “realized.” The realized loss metric specifically tracks such losses being harvested throughout the network (and naturally, the counterpart indicator, the realized profit, measures the profits). Related Reading: Dogecoin Plunges 7% As Whales Make Large Moves Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin entity-adjusted realized loss over the last couple of years: Looks like the value of the metric has been relatively unchanged in recent weeks | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As shown in the above graph, when Bitcoin crashed a couple of days back after the news of fresh regulatory pressure on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, the realized loss had measured around $112 million. Then, the following day, losses were almost halved as the metric measured to around only $64 million. Usually, during volatile events like crashes, there are a large number of investors who panic and sell off their coins, even if they are holding them at a loss. Such investors are generally inexperienced short-term holders, who are quick to lose their conviction in the asset. Because of this reason, sharp plunges in the price of the cryptocurrency have historically been marked by huge capitulation events where the realized loss indicator registers a large spike. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash To $25,800 Sends 6.5% Of Supply Into Loss From the chart, it’s visible that the May 2021 crash, the LUNA collapse in May 2022, the 3AC bankruptcy in June 2022, and the FTX collapse in November 2022 all saw widespread capitulation from the holders. Out of these, the crash after the 3AC bankruptcy saw the largest amount of realized losses, as the indicator’s value hit around $3.1 billion during it, while the FTX collapse saw the least amount of losses at $1.45 billion. Both of these values are, however, extremely large when compared to the losses that Bitcoin investors have harvested in this latest period of price volatility. According to Glassnode, this trend would suggest “an increased degree of resilience amongst market participants.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,800, down 1% in the last week.

42420284,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUemjN,1686153600,To Identify or Not in a Web3 World?,"The topic of identity on-chain has stirred an active debate among participants. The proponents of a fully permissionless ecosystem cite “access for all” and preserving privacy as key arguments for not identifying users on a blockchain. However, the answer to the question of whether it could be beneficial to verify aspects of one’s identity while protecting sensitive information is more nuanced.  Ironically, permissionless decentralized applications (dapps) leave significant groups of users unable to participate. Regulated entities such as asset managers or allocators are generally not able to do business with “bad actors” (terrorists, financial criminals, etc.). In a completely permissionless environment, the participants are unknown, and, therefore, the “bad actor” risk cannot be addressed. Hence, know-your-customer (KYC) checks and the assessment of the potential money laundering risk are important steps to building trust in the digital asset ecosystem and broadening institutional adoption of Web3 opportunities.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  According to a 2022 Institutional Investor survey of 140 respondents with $2.6 trillion of assets under management, regulatory compliance and trust remain the key factors considered with respect to selecting Web3 partners. Therefore, applications seeking institutional liquidity are looking to create compliance-aware platforms. These factors frequently come to the fore on the heels of permissionless pools by the same developers.  When it comes to protecting personal information, permissionless Web3 is hard to beat. Yet, if the users are not able to reveal any aspects of their identity, they cannot leverage their reputations or distinguishing attributes. For example, it’s difficult to prove the “humanity” of a player or the accredited status of an investor if all that is needed to access an application is a digital wallet. Therefore, disclosing certain parts of one’s identity can improve user access to more selective opportunities.  A system where applications can check attributes of user identity without accessing the underlying private data can facilitate more targeted use cases while preserving privacy. For example, a user can decide to share information about their credit reputation while remaining pseudonymous. As a result, dapps can create more differentiated solutions for users meeting particular thresholds.  In conclusion, being able to verify elements of user identity while protecting sensitive data can boost institutional adoption of Web3 and enable participants to be rewarded based on their reputation. Such broader usage of blockchain technology is complementary to the existing permissionless Web3 applications. Additionally, blockchain technology and cryptographic techniques can provide enhanced privacy and secure identity management that let users have greater control over their personal information. By striking a balance between privacy and identity verification, blockchains can realize their full potential so they can support a significant portion of global economic activity.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Lisa Fridman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/06/07/to-identify-or-not-in-a-web3-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be6b0938bcc8dad00b2a752be4b1e453b0b84da8-8333x4687.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420282,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUemfF,1686153600,Bitcoin (Somewhat) Takes Binance Accusations in Stride,"What is it with the month of June within the crypto industry? I had something completely different planned to write this week. Crypto just logged its first losing month of 2023, and my thoughts were around valuations, prices relative to indicators and technical support levels.  But my focus shifted as I was literally putting pen to paper (or fingers to keys for accuracy’s sake).  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Picture two neighbors (who you thought would get along fine) who seemingly dislike each other more every day, arguing outside your window – and then hearing things continue to escalate. That’s how I would characterize the recent developments between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Binance.  Truthfully, the dispute seems to be between regulators and cryptocurrencies in general, where on one side are politicians, the other side are crypto entities and somewhere in the middle are decentralized assets wondering what’s going on as they’re being hit.  The respite from regulators following crypto’s lack of inclusion in the debt-ceiling deal appears to have lasted less than a week.  On Monday, June 5, news broke that the SEC was suing Binance and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao for alleged securities violations.  Of all of the allegations levied, which include offering unregistered securities and running an unregistered exchange, the most damaging one from my vantage point is the allegation of the “commingling” of customer funds.  “Defendants were free to and did transfer investors’ crypto and fiat assets as Defendants pleased, at times commingling and diverting them,” according to the SEC’s filing.  Binance is vehemently pushing back on allegations, stating that “any allegations that user assets on the Binance.US platform have ever been at risk are simply wrong,” and “all user assets on Binance and Binance affiliate platforms including Binance.US. are safe and secure”  But here’s the rub: I personally don’t think that the SEC cares much about “safe and secure” in this instance. What they seem to care about is the word “separate.” And if, through the movement of assets, any customer funds touched an account held by Zhao, even for a millisecond, the SEC will likely jump at the opportunity to throw a punch at Binance.  And if that did in fact occur, then Binance’s chin may truly be exposed. The usage of an old boxing metaphor seems appropriate given that crypto and regulators very much seem to be in a fight.  It's also worth noting that on June 1, Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that crypto is “helping fund” the fentanyl trade, signaling the reintroduction of a Digital Asset Money Laundering legislation, which “closes loopholes.”  It will be interesting to see what ultimately constitutes a “loophole,” along with how many international jurisdictions agree. The Q&A between Warren and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing Elizabeth Rosenberg implies that they would seek international coordination as they take their fight to crypto.  In regards to Binance, the tone of the SEC’s press release seemed a bit more personal than procedural with the inclusion of the descriptor “so-called” when referring to the BNB token and BUSD stablecoin.  The irony of the timing of this announcement is not lost on me, as the month of June is emerging as the worst month of the year for crypto investors.  Where daily average returns for the month of June ranked sixth among all months between 2014-2020, its returns from 2021-2023 rank last.  It was on June 13, 2022, that crypto lender Celsius froze withdrawals and transfers for all customers, citing “extreme market conditions.”  Almost exactly 48 hours later, crypto was caught off balance with this tweet from Three Arrows Capital Founder Zhu Su.  The result of the turmoil was a 37% decline in bitcoin (BTC) during June 2022 from almost $32,000 to $19,966, falling as low as $17,690 at one point. And, almost a year to the day, we receive news of the SEC’s action versus Binance. The market response was notable, with prices declining 5.4% on higher than average volume.  Still it would appear that with every hit that bitcoin and crypto take during June, the blow has tended to weaken. June 13, 2022, is the worst-performing day for BTC since 2021, with prices falling 16%. The 9.7% decline just a few days later on June 16 is the 13th-largest loss over the identical time period.  The 5.4% decline following the SEC’s Binance case doesn’t rank within the top 50 worst-performing days.  It would appear that as each punch is thrown, the assets themselves (i.e. bitcoin, ether, etc.) have certainly taken a hit, but less so than the entities being targeted, which are often centralized in nature.  I’ve contended before and will contend again that the vast majority of issues within crypto surround the actors and not the asset itself.  Digital assets remain a way to transfer capital, essentially moving money around the internet/blockchain, without the need for a trusted third party.  I have no doubt that the fight between regulators and crypto will continue to escalate, but as it intensifies, I’d argue that the assets themselves are starting to weather the impact better.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here’s some news worth reading:  JUXTAPOSITION: On Friday, the Republican chairs of two House committees released a proposed overhaul of crypto regulation in the U.S. It was only a “discussion draft” meant to get negotiations going, and widespread support was far from guaranteed. But it was the kind of comprehensive review of crypto rules that the industry has been asking for for years. And then, days later, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) went nuclear on Binance and then Coinbase, suing both of them, essentially on grounds that existing regulations are adequate and strongly suggesting these businesses simply are not allowed in the U.S. The takeaway here sure seems to be that the direction the political winds blow could determine crypto’s viability in the country.  ANTI-CRYPTO: SEC Chair Gary Gensler wasn’t always anti-crypto. But his stance sure seems to have shifted significantly. “We don’t need more digital currency,” he said on CNBC. “We already have digital currency. It’s called the U.S. dollar.” Gensler said. “We have not seen, over the centuries, that economies and the public need more than one way to move value.” Given how broad that statement is, is the most plain vanilla of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin (BTC), even safe from Washington’s aggressive new stance?  BINANCE’S FUTURE: Often, when the SEC takes action, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) does, too. So far, only the SEC has gone after Binance and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, but there is speculation DOJ could be next. In the face of that, Binance let it be known that Richard Teng is a rising star at the exchange. One wonders if that’s bait for a potential settlement: CZ steps down and Teng takes over.  A BET: Five years ago (back when regulators were barely paying attention), two significant figures in crypto, bitcoin maximalist Jimmy Song and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, tentatively placed a bet. If just five Ethereum decentralized applications (dapps) hit agreed-upon usage thresholds, Lubin would win. They seem to have never finalized their pact, but CoinDesk journalists took a crack at figuring who did win. The conclusion in the article: “If Lubin was the victor, he just squeaked by; it wasn't a blowout. And he might’ve lost, depending on whom you ask.” That feels like a surprise given how much attention and money was thrown at dapps over the past few years.",NEGATIVE,BTC | BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/07/bitcoin-somewhat-takes-binance-accusations-in-stride,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/703bb7b2c9512f44f8904fe675678bf3273661da-4622x2600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Is Tether going to be the next port of call for the SEC? SEC master plan All the grandmasters of chess were able to think many moves ahead and thus lay ambushes for their opponents. While the SEC can hardly be likened to a grandmaster, it probably has it in mind that in order to cause the most consternation in the crypto world a Wells Notice for Tether would be a good move. The SEC, led by its captain Gary Gensler, isn’t the fastest moving or rapier like opponent for crypto, but it does have bludgeoning force. Sending in a suit against Binance was like a typhoon. Then pouring it on by suing Coinbase was akin to a hurricane. Going next for Tether would hit the crypto markets like a tsunami. Choppy seas remain Currently, the crypto market is in rather stormy waters. Bitcoin suffered a 6.4% fall on Tuesday when the Coinbase news came roaring in. The rest of the crypto market followed suit and many cryptocurrencies fell in the double digits. However, perhaps big capital funds were nimble enough to jump into the market when things looked pretty bad and bought the dip, sending Bitcoin and crypto back up to pretty much where they were at the start of the day on Tuesday. So the SEC- inspired storm hit, caused a fair bit of havoc and carnage, but as with all storms it blew over after a while and much fairer weather ensued. Today, the same old lingering fear is palpably still there in crypto. All must be asking themselves that if the SEC cuts off all the banks, swamps the big exchanges with litigation, has a quiet word with the big market makers, and brings in crushing regulation, then how on earth is the industry going to survive? Tether next? And on top of that there is the potential of an SEC move against Tether. John Reed Stark, former SEC Head of Internet Enforcement, has stated that Tether needs to undergo a full traditional financial audit, expressing his astonishment that Tether is allowed to continue without one. John Reed Stark is only a self-styled expert on these matters but he still may have the ear of the SEC and could also be aware of impending moves that the agency might be preparing. Fairer weather for Bitcoin So for crypto at least, the next few weeks and months could see a fair bit of volatility, especially when the waves of bad news come crashing in. However, Bitcoin appears to be outside of all of this. It is one of the only cryptos that the SEC grudgingly admits to being a commodity. That its bull market has begun is a very strong possibility. Also, with other asset classes potentially about to be pummelled should the US and other major economies enter recession, Bitcoin could finally be that hedge out of the toxic traditional financial system that it has wanted to be for so long.

The SWEAT tokens, which constitute around 13% of the total supply, were allocated to users at the app's conception last September but these users have not downloaded the wallet nor followed any of the other steps required to claim them, making them ""abandoned"" or ""idle,"" according to a blog post.  Sweat users can vote on whether to recover the tokens and transfer them to the protocol's treasury for a potential future distribution. The vote will also decide what the Sweat Foundation will do with them in the future, including ""burning a percentage, funding operational costs, or supporting future product launches,"" the blog post said.  A minimum of 75,000 votes are required for the proposal to be accepted or denied. The vote will last for seven days with the possibility of a three-day extension and follow the one-person-one-vote-format introduced for a previous poll in April.

The regulator filed an emergency action application against Binance.US to freeze its assets, as part of the regulator’s recent crackdown on the crypto exchange. Protecting Customer Funds On Binance According to the documents filed with the court, the request was brought forward with the intention of ensuring that the assets of Binance.US clients are safeguarded and kept in the United States. At least pending the outcome of the ongoing litigation being conducted by the SEC. Related Reading: Now That Optimism ‘Bedrock’ Hard Fork Is Done, What Can We Expect? The filing is also looking to activate other emergency relief against Binance Holdings Limited, the arm of the exchange operating globally, and its founder, Changpeng Zhao. This is coming after news broke out on Monday, June 5, that SEC brought 13 charges on Binance.US and its billionaire founder, Changpeng Zhao, saying the company broke US rules by offering securities in the form of cryptocurrencies. According to the charges, the exchange had “no oversight or controls to ensure that the assets are properly secured.” What Does This Mean For The Industry? Basically, the SEC is arguing Binance.US has been illegally facilitating the trading of securities. As the biggest exchange in the world, this has got many investors feeling a bit rattled and confused about what it all means. However, Binance is not the only target of the SEC. The commission also went after Coinbase, alleging that popular cryptocurrencies offered by the exchange qualify as securities. A big part of the crypto community seems to be unified on the matter, as many investors see this as an attack on the entire crypto industry. Of course, Binance.US and Coinbase deny all allegations, with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeting that the “SEC has taken a regulation by enforcement approach that is harming America.” BNB price continues to trend low as SEC goes after Binance | Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com Stay SAFU Binance seems to be calm on the matter as in response, the exchange released a statement saying “we intend to defend our platform vigorously,” although it “will continue to cooperate with regulators and policymakers in the U.S. and across the globe.” Changpeng Zhao also took to Twitter to announce that if the order is granted, it would only affect funds under Binance.US, and not the global Binance.com.

42410455,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdWwal,1686149826,"U.S. SEC Enforcement Could Boost Europe's Crypto Chances, Officials Say","BRUSSELS, Belgium – As the U.S. securities watchdog flexes its muscles against major crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase, officials in the European Union are showing off a brand-new crypto framework they say offers greater clarity to blockchain innovators.  Few if any of the internet giants that dominate Web2 can call the EU their home, but some in Brussels now wonder if Europe’s different approach – regulate first and then see how the market responds – could give it the edge.  Some argue the bloc’s new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) law makes it well-placed to compete with those across the Atlantic, where big crypto players complain the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is indulging in regulation by enforcement rather than setting out clear rules.  “What we hear from businesses is that now a lot of them are looking to grow, to stay safe, and to manage their risks,” said Joachim Schwerin, a principal economist in the European Commission’s department responsible for economic growth. “They don't know what will happen in the U.S., so they come to us. This is good for us, this is good for competitiveness.”  The SEC, which issued suits on Monday and Tuesday against the two popular exchanges, is broadly arguing that the platforms should have registered to offer trading, clearing and brokerage services for crypto, on the grounds that native tokens for blockchains such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and Polygon (MATIC) constitute securities under existing financial law.  Binance’s U.S. arm has called the claims “baseless,” while Coinbase’s Chief legal Officer Paul Grewal said they were damaging to U.S. competitiveness.  “We don't think … that regulators can sit in an office and wait for someone to come in, asking for advice or information, and then before that person goes out, I decide whether to arrest that guy or not,” Schwerin said. “That is not the division of labor that we have in Europe.”  The EU has taken a different approach, legislating a separate tailor-made regime that proponents say better matches what crypto is for. Lawmaker Ondřej Kovařík – the main negotiator of MiCA on behalf of the economically liberal Renew Europe party – appears to agree this rules out the kind of uncertain enforcement seen in the U.S.  U.S. authorities “let you do whatever you want until they don’t, and then they stop you… we don't have this approach here,” Kovařík said, adding the recent SEC moves “can be an opportunity” for Europe.  “I hear businesses saying they may be considering shifting … because of the new framework” offered by MiCA, he said – but stressed the law would need to be implemented smartly.  National and European regulatory agencies are due to set out exactly how the rules will work over the coming 12-18 months. “If it's not applied successfully, then the trend can actually very easily be overturned,” he said.  In France – the EU member with perhaps the most well-developed crypto licensing regime before MiCA takes effect – regulators have said fleeing U.S. companies are “welcome,” while influential U.S. lawmaker Patrick McHenry (R–N.C.) has said Europe’s relative success in legislating for crypto “should send chills up the spines of Americans” because of the likely boost to innovation.

Solana’s charts show bullish potential, although SOL is one of the coins that may be affected by the SEC. Tradecurve, currently in presale, recognises the growing problems of regulation in the US and offers a solution for traders around the world. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW Ripple lawyers remain confident of a win The crypto market reels from the latest Binance lawsuit from the SEC, that could see coins such as SOL, ADA, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, and COTI as securities. However Ripple is notably absent from the lawsuit, adding strength to Ripple lawyer John Deaton’s argument that XRP will not be declared a security. Deaton now anticipates that the case will come to a close around the end of September. He expects either an outright win, or the potential that a cut off line will be drawn that allows Ripple to officially not be a security. He also predicted a potential price for the XRP token assuming that the outcome is favorable, saying that “I certainly believe that somewhere between $2 and $10 is reasonable”. Solana is named in the SEC vs Binance lawsuit. Although Solana has been demonstrating bullish potential from a technical analysis point of view, the recent Binance lawsuit names Solana’s coin SOL in the lawsuit, as an unregistered security. This isn’t the first lawsuit that Binance have faced, and similarly to the XRP vs Ripple case, the judgment could go either way. Still it’s not great news for the layer 1 chain, and Solana’s price has fallen by 7% over the last 24 hours, currently trading at around $20 per coin. Solana and the other tokens and coins named in the lawsuit, may take comfort in the words of John Deaton, who believes that it may be possible for future redemption even if they do get named as securities. This is because once cryptocurrencies like Solana achieve a significant level of decentralization, there is a possibility that they could transition from being classified as securities to being recognized as commodities. Is Tradecurve the answer to regulatory woes? As the US continues to pursue aggressive anti crypto regulations, in what Nic Carter sees as a concerted effort to de-platform crypto from the banking system, the need for regulation free platforms increases. This could be where Tradecurve gets its chance to shine, offering a borderless and KYC trading platform that combines the financial products of TradFi, including commodities, stocks and bonds, and of course, crypto. Tradecurve are based in St Vincent and Kitts where offering these products are legal. Tradecurve follows Binance and other exchanges such as Gemini, who are increasingly looking to move their operations outside of the US. Tradecurve’s token is TCRV, and is currently in stage 3 of presale. TCRV is changing hands at $0.015 and will launch at a minimum price of $0.088. Experts are predicting a rise as big as 1000x once it is listed on Uniswap and tier 1 CEXes.

InQubeta (QUBE) proves to be a promising option.","Investing in cryptocurrency is one of the most rewarding ventures. The volatility of the crypto market makes it easy for cryptos to multiply or decline rapidly. With recent market issues surrounding some of the best cryptos, investors are actively searching for promising cryptos to boost their portfolios. InQubeta (QUBE) is the new kid on the block. The emerging token is one of the best investment options on the market. After attracting numerous enthusiasts, the coin has raised over $295k in presale. This presale success sets QUBE apart as a must-have token for any investor. InQubeta has solidified its position as the best cryptocurrency to invest in, alongside Hedera (HBAR), Binance Coin (BNB), and Ripple (XRP). As investors seek alternative investment options, these four tokens have the most promising and unique features. This article will examine why InQubeta, Hedera, Binance Coin, and Ripple are the best options for great returns. InQubeta (QUBE) is a unique decentralized crowdfunding platform for AI startups. InQubeta is a rising cryptocurrency taking the lead among other AI cryptos. The project provides an innovative platform that offers funding solutions for the budding artificial intelligence market. The token has shown massive growth potential after raising over $295,000 in the first week of the presale run. The InQubeta platform offers equity-based NFTs for investors looking to ride on the wave of AI. InQubeta's NFT marketplace enables AI startups to create and develop their NFTs as a fraction of their project. As a beginner cryptocurrency leveraging AI and the decentralized finance market, InQubeta has massive growth potential. The QUBE token is the best cryptocurrency to invest in because of its remarkable growth rate. The unique ERC20 token is set to rise by over 400% before its presale concludes. The token has sold over 70% in the ""Beta Stage"" and is projected to do more in the coming weeks. The demand for the QUBE token is about to skyrocket as the crypto market prepares for the next bull season. Investors can benefit from possible price increases and earn rewards from the dedicated reward pool by holding and staking QUBE tokens. Visit InQubeta Presale Hedera (HBAR) is a secure cryptocurrency for decentralized applications (dApps). Hedera is a decentralized network that provides a sustainable and more efficient open-source network for dApps. The platform uses a cutting-edge solution that eliminates older blockchain networks' limitations. Hedera uses a consensus mechanism that facilitates communication among dApps. HBAR became popular in the last bull run after a new all-time high. The coin's value has sharply declined since the beginning of the year. The HBAR token is, however, projected to bounce back in the next bull market. Binance Coin (BNB) shows new bearish signals. Binance Coin is the native token of the Binance network. The token has grown massively over the years due to the growing popularity of its host network. Binance Coin enables users to invest in dApps on Binance. Binance Coin has received great patronage, and the token is one of the best cryptos to invest in. The BNB token has spiraled downward, plunging below 7% in the last two weeks. Analysts believe that the negative pressure in the market causes this bearish stance. BNB might be struggling, but it is a worthy investment option. Ripple (XRP) is positioned for massive price gains. Ripple is getting media attention because of its move to expand the company using cash inflows. The platform announced that it had acquired stakes in Bitsmap, one of the oldest exchange platforms. Ripple could have significant gains because of this move. The XRP ledger recorded more than 1.32 million daily transactions in the first quarter of 2023. This token has promising growth potential. XRP is a good crypto with long-term returns. Conclusion As investors seek alternatives to boost their portfolios, InQubeta proves to be the most promising investment option. The beginner cryptocurrency is snowballing, and investors are enjoying its popularity. Furthermore, InQubeta's growing community is bringing together like-minded people interested in AI startups. This will allow users to share ideas, thoughts, and lessons about the crypto and AI markets. As a result of this, the InQubeta platform will gain more ground.

Shift your focus to InQubeta the new 30x AI Crypto Token,"Lately, the crypto market has been on a topsy-turvy ride, but that hasn’t deterred investors from seeking the next big opportunity. Dogecoin (DOGE), a cryptocurrency that gained popularity through its meme-inspired branding, saw significant growth in the previous bull run. However, with the market evolving and new prospects emerging, investors are now turning their attention to promising projects like InQubeta (QUBE). This article explores whether it's too late to buy Dogecoin and why investors are shifting their focus to InQubeta's presale as interest in AI coins continues to surge. The Dogecoin Phenomenon Dogecoin made headlines as a playful cryptocurrency that gained a cult-like following, largely driven by social media and celebrity endorsements. Its low transaction fees and fast transaction times attracted a considerable user base, pushing its price to unprecedented levels. However, as the market matures and investors seek more sustainable and long-term opportunities, the question arises: Is it too late to buy Dogecoin? The Rise of InQubeta InQubeta (QUBE) has been steadily gaining attention in the cryptocurrency community due to its unique value proposition and focus on the AI industry. The platform offers fractional investment in AI start-ups using blockchain technology, enabling investors to participate in the growth of this burgeoning sector. As interest in AI technology continues to rise, InQubeta's presale has garnered significant attention from investors looking for the next game-changing project. There are several reasons why investors are shifting their focus from Dogecoin to InQubeta. First and foremost, Dogecoin's meteoric rise has led to concerns about its sustainability and long-term viability. The initial hype and speculative trading have created a volatile market, making it riskier for investors seeking stability and long-term growth. On the other hand, InQubeta presents a compelling opportunity for investors interested in the AI industry. AI is a rapidly evolving field with immense potential, and InQubeta's platform provides a means to access this market through fractional investment model. This not only lowers the barrier to entry but also incentivizes users who invest in the native asset, $QUBE.

As more investors recognize the potential of AI technology and the opportunities presented by InQubeta's platform, QUBE might well climb the ladder quicker than anyone can anticipate. The presale price will keep on increasing at every stage, so this may be a good time to invest. Conclusion While Dogecoin has captured the attention of the crypto world with its viral popularity, investors are now shifting their focus to more promising and sustainable opportunities. InQubeta's presale has emerged as an attractive option, offering fractional investment in AI start-ups and capitalizing on the growing interest in AI coins.

They still have a long way to go before regaining their losses from last year. If you are banking on either of these cryptocurrencies gaining value, you might consider looking for alternatives. Uwerx (WERX) has stolen the spotlight in the crypto industry and has the potential to grow into a significant cryptocurrency asset. Read on as we explore these projects one after the other. Polkadot and the Web3 Revolution One key distinction is Polkadot's (DOT) involvement in the visionary Web3 project, which seeks to create a decentralized, user-controlled internet. Polkadot's (DOT) design prioritizes interoperability, making it possible for several blockchains to communicate with one another without any hitches. Polkadot's (DOT) unique characteristics set it apart as a significant player in the evolving Web3 market. The rise of decentralized apps and services is changing how we interact with the internet. Polkadot (DOT) is the digital equivalent of glue, holding this idea together. It appears to be a formidable competitor in the crypto sector; however, no one can predict the future with certainty. Chainlink (LINK) Stuck? Chainlink (LINK) is a fundamental Web2-to-Web3 data interface that allows critical off-chain data integration in blockchains. Like Polkadot (DOT), its value has decreased over time. Currently, Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $6.49, a significant decline from its high point 20 months ago. During the 2021 bull run, the project also had a considerable uptick, with Chainlink (LINK) hitting an all-time high of $52.25 at that time. However, hope is not entirely gone. Many industry experts believe that as the current market improves, Chainlink (LINK) will as well. The Proof-of-Reserves strategy is also gaining traction in the business world. However, even the most bullish analysts predict Chainlink (LINK) won't go higher than $11. That is a somewhat lower expected performance than Polkadot (DOT), with Chainlink (LINK) achieving a maximum of 60%. The Value of Uwerx (WERX) Soars on the Cryptocurrency Market UWERX (WERX) is a freelancing platform that competes with large-scale traditional platforms by providing more affordable and transparent ways to work in the gig economy. According to reports, 70% of small to medium-sized organizations have used freelancers at least once. Transparent third-party audits by Interfi Network and SolidProof at prelaunch, a liquidity lock of 25 years after presale, and contract ownership renunciation on the books make this one of the safest investment choices available right now. The present presale performance demonstrates its credibility, as Presale Phase 4 exceeded expectations by selling out its allotted 77,500,000 WERX in record time. Uwerx is now in Presale Phase 5 with over 5,546 coin holders. Additionally, a test airdrop is in the works, and the newly released platform's Alpha version will bring in even more investors. In addition to its innovative features, Uwerx revealed the Uwerx Vault. This original and unique new feature is meant to optimize sustainability as well as reward and enhance user engagement. WERX is now trading at $0.041and is expected to rise to $1.03 by Q3 2023; it has also provided a 15% discount to early investors who wish to participate. Hop onboard the Uwerx train so that you may reap the rewards of the anticipated x100 growth over the coming months.

LDO has joined the top-gaining coins today, June 7, with an over 6% price increase over the past 24 hours. The token closely follows PEPE, which has gained over 12% in the last 24 hours. LDO Price Surge Amid Improved Market Sentiments While LDO ranked 6th among top daily gainers, it scored second among top weekly gainers with a 13.48% price increase over the past seven days. Having a high of $2.45 and a low of $2.22, LDO is eyeing the $2.5 price level and might conquer it if the bulls continue to dominate the market. Related Reading: Chainlink Bulls Must Uphold This Critical Support Line For Potential 8% Rally According to CoinMarketCap data, Lido DAO has witnessed impressive price performances over the past 30 days. The token price has increased by over 36% in the last 30 days, 20.2% in 14 days, and 13.48% over the past seven days. The crypto market seems bullish as investors anticipate the May CPI data, which the US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release on June 13. The inflation rate reduced to 4.95% in April from the 5.0% recorded in March against the 5.0% forecasted by economists. This shows that the Fed’s hawkish inflation-curbing strategy is taking effect. Moreover, given the increasing recession and severe macroeconomic conditions, the Federal Reserve said it would pause the interest rates hike. And that has been reflected in crypto prices as Bitcoin prices pushed higher above $28,000. The sentiments appear higher still, even as investors anticipate the upcoming CPI data release. At press time, the crypto market cap is up by 2.86%, while the total market volume has increased by 12.13%, rubbing off on most coins. Increased Network Activities Propel LDO Price The effect of the crypto market volume increase on assets is evident on LDO’s trading volume, which has increased by over 37% in the last 24 hours. That’s not all. According to Stelareum data, LDO total value locked (TVL) is up by 4.59%, against the 5.09% decline recorded on June 6. Lido Analytics also shows that LIDO TVL spiked 7.24% from May 29 to June 5, ending the week at $13.54 billion. As of June 5, LDO staking led on Ethereum with a net deposit of 264.99K ETH, followed by an unknown contract with 215.68K ETH deposits. That suggested increased trading activities on the protocol, which could also push the LDO price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Casino Canada: The Best Sites for Crypto Gambling 2023 Meanwhile, LDO technical analysis on TradingView flags a strong buy signal. LDO’s price has climbed above all the Exponential and Simple Moving Averages but remains below the Hull Moving Average at 2.360. Chances are high that the token would push above the $2.5 mark if it can conquer the Hull Moving Average.

The 2 billion SWEAT tokens, constituting ~13% of the total supply, are currently locked up in a 24-month contract in inactive user accounts. After the successful Token Generation Event last September, a considerable number of users, despite repeated prompts, have yet to activate the Sweat Wallet application and claim their tokens. The new governance vote aims to resolve the lingering question: what should be done with these idle tokens? Sweat Economy now allows token holders to participate directly in the decision-making process, exercising the principle of one person, one vote, thereby democratizing the token's future. Users can either vote in favor of having the 2 billion idle SWEAT tokens recovered and transferred back to the Sweat Treasury for potential future distribution (or other uses as decided by subsequent votes), or users can vote in favor of leaving these tokens in inactive user accounts. A minimum of 75,000 votes is required for the proposal to be accepted or denied, and in order to ensure everyone has a fair opportunity to make their vote count, the proposal will run for at least seven days, with the possibility of a three-day extension, in the event of an ongoing influx of votes. This new governance vote is notable because of the vast volume of SWEAT tokens at stake and the deepening commitment of Sweat Economy to community-centric decision-making. The platform is determined to ensure all voices are heard, regardless of the size of their SWEAT holdings. This intention resonates well with the community, as highlighted by user feedback: “Thanks for letting the community know before the vote is live. Much better for transparency.” “It’s a good proposal! I can’t wait to see what they propose to do with over 2 billion $SWEAT!” The previous vote attracted a whopping 153,783 participants, and Sweat Economy is optimistic about seeing even higher engagement numbers this time, given the magnitude of SWEAT tokens involved. This milestone event strengthens Sweat Economy's mission to create a more inclusive, transparent, and democratized ecosystem, continuing to foster strong community involvement and influence over pivotal decisions. About Sweat Economy Established in 2015, Sweat Economy promotes healthier living by encouraging people to move more. Sweatcoin, the most downloaded health and fitness app globally in 2022, incentivizes over 130 million users to move more by earning sweatcoins, dubbed 'Airmiles for steps.' The in-app currency can be redeemed for branded products, digital services, or donated to various charities. Last summer, Sweat Economy launched the Sweat Wallet app and its cryptocurrency, $SWEAT, to further reward users and establish a tangible financial unit of value for movement. Over 14 million users received airdropped tokens, constituting the largest crypto giveaway ever. By harnessing the decentralized power of Web3, the company is well on its way to creating a true economy of movement where health and wealth intersect.

This week, in two separate suits, the SEC alleged that the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, and its rival Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, violated securities laws because the agency considers many crypto assets to be securities, not currencies. Therefore, the assets need to be registered and the exchanges that facilitate trading also are required to be registered, according to the SEC's argument. ""If it takes going to the Supreme Court, that's what we're prepared to do,"" Coinbase ( COIN ) Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said in an interview with Bloomberg. ""I think that every court that looks at this issue is going to conclude the SEC has fundamentally gotten this wrong."" Meanwhile, Coinbase ( COIN ) has been seeking clearer guidance from regulators. In April, the company sued the SEC in its effort to get a ""yes"" or ""no"" to its July 2022 petition asking the regulator to use its formal rulemaking process to provide guidance to the crypto industry. In commenting on the suit via Twitter, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong again called for clarity around crypto rules in the U.S. ""There is no path to 'come in and register' — we tried, repeatedly — so we don't list securities. We reject the vast majority of assets we review,"" he said . Regarding Coinbase's ( COIN ) suit against the SEC, a U.S. court of appeals issued an order asking the SEC to provide within seven days a letter answering whether it has denied the petition and how much more time it would need to reach a decision. After the SEC's suit against Coinbase ( COIN ), BTIG analyst Isaac Boltansky says there's ""no viable argument to be made suggesting that this is positive for Coinbase, but we do believe it should be viewed as a positive step toward clarity for the whole digital ecosystem."" Of the crypto lawsuits outstanding, ""this one feels uniquely well positioned to be ultimately heard by the Supreme Court,"" Boltansky wrote in a note to clients. The Ripple case has procedural nuances that make it less ideal for bringing judicial clarity and the Binance lawsuit could add layers if the Justice Department also brings charges. The questions about crypto regulation would best be addressed by Congress rather than the courts, as it could take ""three to five years for judicial clarity that may be both narrower and murkier,"" Boltansky wrote in a note to clients. While Congress remains deeply divided along partisan lines, Armstrong sees a glimmer of hope for a legislative resolution, pointing to the McHenry Thomson draft bill that came out last week. ""This is the start of something really useful, which is a clear market structure for crypto clear delineation between what the CFTC and the SEC are supposed to do,"" he said on CNBC Wednesday.

On Tuesday evening, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed an emergency application for a temporary restraining order to freeze the assets of BAM Management US Holdings and BAM Trading Services. The SEC alleges that Binance’s parent company and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, secretly controlled these two units. The agency said in a press release that relief is sought to protect Binance.US customers’ assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed an emergency action application seeking a temporary restraining order freezing assets, directing defendants to repatriate assets held for the benefit of customers of the Binance.US crypto trading platform, and seeking other emergency relief against Binance Holdings Limited, BAM Trading Services Inc., BAM Management US Holdings, Inc., and their founder, Changpeng Zhao, to ensure that Binance.US customers’ assets are protected and remain in the United States through the resolution of the SEC’s pending litigation of this matter. In its motion, the agency said it resorted to this step following “years of violative conduct, disregard of the laws of the United States, evasion of regulatory oversight, and open questions about various financial transfers and the custody and control of Customer Assets.” According to the complaint, Binance has shown a “blatant disregard of federal securities laws.” Binance.US and CZ Respond Binance.US responded to the motion on Twitter, assuring customers that “User assets remain safe and secure.” This afternoon, the SEC filed a motion seeking a TRO and preliminary injunction against https://t.co/AZwoBOgsqS attempting to, amongst other things, freeze https://t.co/AZwoBOgsqS corporate assets.

The regulator accused the exchange of allegedly mishandling customer funds and lying to investors and regulators about its operations. It further accused Zhao and the exchange of failing to restrict US customers from its platform and misleading investors about its market surveillance controls. Both the exchange and its CEO have denied the SEC allegations. The SEC doubled down on its regulatory efforts on Tuesday by filing suit against fellow crypto exchange Coinbase. According to the agency Coinbase acted as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency and charged it for “the unregistered offer and sale of securities in connection with its staking-as-a-service program.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Many consider the power to selectively reveal or hide oneself to the world a human right, but it is often abused by criminals, leading to calls for increased government surveillance, which in turn encroaches on the privacy of law-abiding citizens who make up the vast majority of crypto users.

13220376,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536809,1686142820,Bitcoin Contrarians Win As Rebound Occurs Against Crowd Expectations: Santiment,"Data from Santiment suggests that the latest Bitcoin rebound took place after most investors had given up on the idea of it happening. Bitcoin Observes Rebound After “Buy The Dip” Crowd Goes Silent According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, calls for buying the dip had mostly disappeared right before the actual rebound. The indicator of interest here is the “social volume,” which measures the total number of social media text documents that mention a given topic or term. The text documents here refer to a collection of posts/threads derived from various social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Telegram, and 4chan. Note that the metric only cares about whether such posts make at least one mention of the given term, and not exactly how many times they do it. This means that even if a thread mentions the topic several times, its contribution to the social volume still remains one unit. The benefit of this restriction is that it provides a better picture about the trend being followed in the whole sector, as only a few posts with a lot of discussion can’t skew the total in their favor this way. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Below $26,000, Triggers Over $300 Million In Liquidations Now, in the context of the current discussion, cryptocurrency-related talks where users call out to “buy the dip” are of relevance. So, Santiment has taken the social volume of the entire digital asset sector and has then filtered it specifically using terms related to “buy” and “dip.” Here is a chart that shows the social volume related to this topic broken down for each of the major social media platforms: The value of the metric seems to have had a surge a couple of days back | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, right after Bitcoin and the rest of the market had crashed due to the news of SEC suing Binance breaking out, the social volume for discussions related to these terms had observed a large spike on Reddit and Twitter. This would imply that users had become hyped and had started calling for buying the dip as soon as the price plunge had occurred. As it turned out, however, there wasn’t any price rebound just yet, and BTC rather continued to go down after the market had become excited. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash To $25,800 Sends 6.5% Of Supply Into Loss As the coin continued to move mostly sideways over the next day, though, the discussions related to buying the dip started to die out. That’s when the actual rebound in the asset’s price took place, seemingly catching the mainstream crowd off guard. Historically, Bitcoin and other assets have usually been more likely to show moves in a direction opposite to the majority’s view. The more lopsided the crowd gets toward one direction, the more probable the market becomes to show the reverse kind of move. Because of this reason, the followers of “contrarian investing” believe that it’s best to buy whenever the crowd is fearful and ideal to sell when greed is king in the market. It seems like this Bitcoin rebound would have worked into the favor of these contrarian traders. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,600, down 2% in the last week.

42410460,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdWwkg,1686142801,No More FTXs! Consensus 2023 Attendees Discuss Future of Crypto Custody,"After the implosion of FTX, the conversation about trusting centralized bodies with crypto keys returned to the limelight. Several million customers are still waiting to reclaim somewhere between $1 billion and $10 billion worth of crypto assets tied up in the Bahamas-based exchange, according to the initial bankruptcy filings.  The collapse reminded people that self-custodying your own digital assets, by keeping the cryptographic keys (on their own computers, or a hardware device disconnected from the internet, or even written on a piece of paper locked in a safe), would spare consumers from being burned by schemes like FTX.  This article is excerpted from CoinDesk’s inaugural Consensus @ Consensus Report, the product of intimate, curated group discussions that took place at Consensus 2023.  Crypto purists have long argued that self-custody is the only way to go and that having control over one’s own keys avoids the perils of centralization. But crypto users have often observed that custodying one's keys is nerve-wracking, as there are few recovery mechanisms in place if users lose their keys.  A closed-door roundtable conversation at Consensus 2023 looked at how policymakers can create effective guidelines for consumer protection without undermining, and perhaps advancing, the crypto ethos of controlling your own assets. Participants hailed from a variety of backgrounds, from technology to regulation to business.  The challenge is acute. Consider the responses to a poll question posed to the broader Consensus audience: What percent of users have skills/comfort to store crypto keys?  See also: Thanks Sam! How FTX Led to World's Worst Crypto Policy | Opinion  Of the 169 attendees who answered the electronic survey, slightly more than half (54%) answered that less than 10% of crypto users were competent and comfortable storing their own keys.

Legal risk is always present in cryptos, and Coinbase is now under even more significant scrutiny. Bitcoin looks weak at the moment, COIN stock is nowhere near cheap, and I'm looking for a break below $47. Bitcoin-related stocks have been on a wild ride recently, and for good reason; the coin itself is on the verge of a major technical breakdown, and the regulatory authorities in the US are on the prowl. Bitcoin has been weak since mid-April when it hit a relative high, but has drifted lower ever since. That’s (rightfully) put pressure on crypto-related stocks, but this week’s news flow has introduced a more pointed headwind for crypto companies. On the 5 th , the SEC sued Binance for violating US securities regulations, and on the 6 th , Coinbase ( COIN ) had a similar fate befall it when the SEC sued it for operating an unregistered securities broker . To be clear, none of these things are bullish for crypto or crypto-related stocks, which is a far cry from my last update on Coinbase a few months ago. At that time, COIN was flying and had a nice uptrend in place; that’s all gone and we appear to be on the verge of a breakdown. In this article, we’ll explore why I’m downgrading Coinbase on this news. Coinbase stock - A tenuous hold for the bulls We’ll begin with a daily chart, and as you can see, the stock has a precarious hold on the prior relative low. Given the price action we’ve seen, I’m not sure this is going to hold. StockCharts We have a lower high put in at the beginning of June, and yesterday, the stock moved below the prior relative low at $47. It recovered to close at $51, but this chart has a significant amount of damage on it. On the more bullish side, the PPO is trading near the centerline, and should the low from yesterday hold, it would mark a positive divergence. However, given the high-volume selling yesterday, it looks to me like the bears are in control of this one for the time being. Should the low from yesterday break, I think there’s downside to the double bottom the stock put in at $31 a few month ago; that’s 33% lower from the low set yesterday if it were to occur, so watching that level is critical. If you insist on owning this stock right now, I would cut losses and run if yesterday’s low is violated, because it could get really ugly after that. The final panel shows Coinbase’s performance relative to Bitcoin itself, and we can see this ratio has been in a steady downtrend for the better part of the last year. This argues that if you want crypto exposure, you’re much better off just owning Bitcoin than Coinbase. Something to consider given the recent news flow. Speaking of Bitcoin, I think we’re at a crossroads here, and we’re on the verge of a potentially big move. StockCharts Bitcoin is putting in a rather bearish descending triangle right now, but I’ll note that critical support continues to hold. We’re nearing the point where Bitcoin is either going to breakout higher, or break down lower, as the triangle closes up. My bias right now, and it’s just a bias, is that we see Bitcoin break lower. Descending triangles like this one generally resolve with a break lower, and the PPO on this one suggests lower is the path of least resistance. None of this is a guarantee, but my preferred scenario for Bitcoin right now is a break lower. However, I’m open to either resolution, and I’ll wait for the chart to tell me which direction it’s going. If I’m right and the next move is lower in Bitcoin, that’s yet another headwind for Coinbase. But more immediately, Coinbase faces legal headwinds, which we’ll touch on now. Legal woes plague crypto sector We all know that crypto is subject to legal headline risk. That’s been the case for years, and it will probably remain the case until cryptos are regulated like stocks and commodities are today. This week’s news flow seems to support that as the SEC has made it clear it is not backing down on regulating this corner of the finance world. Coinbase was sued by the SEC this week as the regulator alleges that Coinbase is operating as an unregistered securities broker. The SEC says that Coinbase has “unlawfully facilitated the buying and selling of crypto asset securities” since at least 2019. Further, the SEC says Coinbase commingled and unlawfully offered exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions, which are to be separated according to securities regulations. The SEC is thereby alleging that cryptos are securities – not currencies – and should be regulated as such. As ugly as that is, Binance’s SEC suit was much worse, alleging fraud and inappropriate usage and movement of customer funds. To be clear, Binance is essentially being charged with fraud while Coinbase is more of a regulatory play. However, having a major crypto player like Binance being charged with some pretty nasty stuff is not a good look for cryptos or other crypto-related companies. I think that more regulation of cryptos and the companies that support them would ultimately be good for the space. While this is the exact opposite of what crypto enthusiasts want – which is total freedom and lack of regulation – making crypto more mainstream by having it regulated by the SEC would open up enormous sums of money to invest in it. So, while these new flows are short-term headwinds, I think at some point down the road this will all be good for crypto and the companies that are running legitimate businesses to support them. However, in the short term, these are significant headwinds for Coinbase, and I think the stock was rightly punished yesterday on the news. And as we’ll see below, even with the move lower, shares aren’t even really that cheap. Estimates continue to move lower Let’s take a look at revenue revisions, which aren’t exactly inspiring a lot of confidence in the bull case right now. Seeking Alpha Revenue has plunged, both in actuals in recent quarters, and in expectations from analysts. Coinbase needs a raging bull market in Bitcoin in particular to drive volume from customers, and we simply don’t have it. As I said above, my outlook for Bitcoin isn’t exactly bullish at the moment, and while I’m open to a bullish resolution on the pattern I noted, that’s not my base case. Given that, my outlook for revenue estimates for Coinbase is also flat to lower. Finally, the valuation of the stock isn’t even attractive. The stock is near relative lows, but the valuation is still in the middle of the range for the past year. TIKR The stock trades for 4.2X forward sales, which is near the average of 4.4X. If the stock were back at 2.5X forward sales I’d be more sympathetic to a bullish resolution, but it isn’t, so I’m not. The bottom line here is that legal risk, a weak chart for Bitcoin, and an even weaker chart on the stock itself has me thinking it’s time to move on from Coinbase. I’m downgrading the stock to sell as I simply don’t see the risk as being worth the potential reward. The key level is $47 on Coinbase, and if that fails, I think it could be a very attractive short. I’m not recommending anyone go out and short as that involves a lot of risk, but if that’s your thing, you can short Coinbase under $47, with a stop just above that. My base case right now is we see a break of $47, and a potential move down to the double bottom at $31. It’s a sell.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4609986-coinbase-stock-rating-downgraded-sell?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13210367.jpeg

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) quickly bounced back after tumbling to a three-month low of less than $25,500 on Tuesday following news that Coinbase (COIN), had been sued by the U.S. Securities and Commission Exchange (SEC) on allegations of violating federal securities law. This followed a similar suit against Binance on Monday. Already on its heels following the Binance suit, bitcoin sank further on the Coinbase action before recovering throughout the day to again top $27,000. It’s retreated a bit overnight Wednesday to the current $26,800, still up 4% over the last 24 hours. “The price action is certainly encouraging and shows the market remains confident on the outlook for the space despite attempts to slow it down by way of a path to regulation that has been less than clear,” said LMAX Digital in a morning note. The Coinbase lawsuit also listed 13 tokens which could be deemed as securities, including Cardano’s ADA, and Polygon’s MATIC, both of which are down 5% over the past 24-hours.  Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management, the second-largest holder of Coinbase Global (COIN) stock, added to its investment in the crypto exchange after the SEC lawsuit Tuesday sent the share price tumbling. ARK bought 419,324 shares of Coinbase, which would be worth around $21.6 million based on Tuesday's closing price of $51.61 (down 12% on the session). The purchase, the first since May 3, took Ark’s total Coinbase holdings to 11.44 million shares, valuing the position at around $590 million.  In a different case involving the SEC and Coinbase, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has ordered the agency to clarify its position on a rulemaking petition from the exchange. In April, Coinbase filed an Administrative Procedure Act Challenge, asking the court to force the SEC's hand and get the regulator to respond to its 2022 petition for formal rule making in the digital assets sector. With yesterday’s ruling, the SEC has been ordered to explain within 7 days if it intends to decline Coinbase’s request, the reasons for such a decision or a timeline of when it expects to come to a decision.

The case brought by investors against Kardashian, retired boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. and National Basketball Association Hall of Famer Paul Pierce among others, made headlines last year. The celebrities were accused of misleading investors through the promotion of digital assets tied to EMAX tokens, which are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain but are not tied to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.  Although a tentative ruling from December indicated District Court Judge Michael Fitzgerald was leaning toward granting Kardashian’s motion to throw out the allegations against her, an attempt to dismiss an amended complaint by her was denied in a Tuesday order.  “Plaintiffs substantially amended the previous complaint adding over 100 pages of new allegations,” the order said.  In the expanded complaint, plaintiffs “adequately alleged” that Kardashian’s social media posts from May 2022 “were false” and a June post was “misleading as it falsely suggested the EMAX tokens were scarce,” according to the document.  A motion to dismiss similar claims by Pierce was denied, while Mayweather’s motion was partly granted on the grounds that his comments regarding EMAX at the Bitcoin 2021 conference were statements of belief.  Judge Fitzgerald also ruled in favor of blocking several securities claims added to the plaintiffs' amended complaint, granting the dismissals for a “lack of specificity but not for lack of privity,” with possibility to amend.  The defendants, including EMAX Holdings LLC, argued the investors – after a full year following their initial complaint, which hadn't mentioned securities – ""now claim that purchases of EMAX Tokens are and have always been “investment contracts.”  In October, Kardashian was fined $1.2 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for shilling EMAX to her millions of Instagram followers.

13209460,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536804,1686137417,Chainlink Bulls Must Uphold This Critical Support Line For Potential 8% Rally,"At present, Chainlink (LINK) continues to witness further losses, with the altcoin experiencing a decline of nearly 7% in the past 24 hours. This depreciation has led LINK to touch its lowest point in several months, primarily driven by the overall weakness observed in the broader market. On the weekly chart, LINK has lost approximately 4% of its value. Although there has been a slight recovery from the nearest support, the technical analysis of LINK still suggests a bearish outlook. Demand and accumulation indicators have also declined on the chart. As Bitcoin begins to recover, moving back into the $26,000 range after a drop into the $25,000 zone, altcoins have also initiated their respective recovery processes. However, the sustainability of this recovery relies on the return of demand and buying confidence in the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Regains Strength But Key Downtrend Resistance Intact For LINK to experience significant price growth, it needs to surpass its overhead resistance level. Since encountering strong resistance at the critical level of $8.70, bears have dominated the market, resulting in intensified selling pressure and the breaking of significant support levels. Currently, the market capitalization of LINK remains low, indicating a lack of buyers in the market at the time of writing. Chainlink Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, Chainlink (LINK) was trading at $6.17. As Bitcoin rebounded to the $26,000 level, LINK also experienced a bounce from its support level of $6. The immediate overhead resistance for the altcoin was $6.36. If this resistance level is surpassed, Chainlink could potentially reach $6.70, leading to a significant rally of 8%. However, it’s worth noting that prevailing market weakness could still cause LINK to depreciate further at the time of writing. In such a scenario, a drop from the current price level would bring the coin to $6, followed by $5.60. If the bulls manage to defend the price at $5.60, it could pave the way for LINK to rise above the $7 level. The volume of LINK traded in the last session was in the red, indicating a lack of strong buying strength in the market. Technical Analysis Due to the prevailing low buying confidence, demand for Chainlink (LINK) has remained low. This is evident as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is below the half-line, indicating that sellers are dominating the market at the time of writing. Moreover, LINK has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, signaling a downtrend and sellers are driving the price momentum, further reinforcing the bearish sentiment in the market. In addition to other technical indicators, Chainlink (LINK) has displayed sell signals on the chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which indicates price momentum and changes, formed red histograms associated with sell signals for the altcoin. This suggests a bearish outlook for LINK. Related Reading: Aave Extends Losses But Here Are The Short Selling Targets The Directional Movement Index (DMI) also supports the downtrend, with the -DI line (orange) positioned above the +DI line (blue). Furthermore, the Average Directional Index (ADX), represented in red, moved above the 20-mark, indicating that the price trend is gaining strength.

42410450,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdWwKE,1686137241,Research Shows Majority of Pepe Investors Caught in High-Stakes Game of Musical Chairs,"The majority of Pepecoin (PEPE) investors were left playing a game of musical chairs as early participants made the bulk of gains, new research from SingularityDAO shows.  The early profit taking has drained the token of substantial liquidity, leaving majority of investors unable to make meaningful profits, the report adss.  Over 80% of potential profits were accrued in the first week of pepecoin’s issuance, when the ‘Pepe the Frog’ themed meme coins went from a market capitalization of low five figures to $33 million in just over a week.  The tokens since ran to a peak market capitalization of $1.8 billion in mid-May, seeing trading volumes surpass those of dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) – which are otherwise the biggest meme coins by trading volume.  Some analysts have repeatedly rang the alarm bells around the early activity of pepecoin traders as well as the absence of retail traders. The major risk has been too many tokens in too few hands, leaving the price action dependent on a few investors. PEPE prices have dropped 73% since their May peak, CoinGecko data shows, and available liquidity remains a persistent concern.  ""The limited amount of net liquidity is creating a high-stakes game of music chairs,” shared Rafe Tariq, Senior Quant at SingularityDAO in the research note. “Everyday investors are being lured in with the hopes of big profits but the reality is that a small percentage of investors will walk away with profit, while everyone else will get burnt.""  SingularityDAO also found that a small number of large-scale investors, known as ""whales"", hold up to approximately 25% of PEPE, while other large investors hold up 46% of the currently circulating supply.  “This means that a minority of investors hold a high degree of influence over the coin's price, creating an even more risky investing environment for hopeful traders,” Tariq added, indicating that the majority of investors had “already missed the opportunity to gain huge profits before even investing in the coin.”  “What appeared to be an exciting opportunity to make a quick buck on the surface was nothing more than false hope for the average individual,” Tariq concluded.",NEGATIVE,SHIB,BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | RESEARCH,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/07/research-shows-majority-of-pepe-investors-caught-in-high-stakes-game-of-musical-chairs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d926ee9442131cd638550762d158c8b43fe1132-2684x1510.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The collection is the first in a series of projects by the luxury brand that look to offer the brand’s elite clientele with exclusive perks and experiences. The Treasure Trunks Collection The collection will consist of a few hundred NFTs, with each Treasure Trunk NFT coming with a matching made-to-order Louis Vuitton trunk. A Louis Vuitton trunk sells for tens of thousands of dollars. The collection will open for registration on the 8th of June, 2023. It will only be available to consumers who are based in the United States of America, France, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, and Germany. Select customers will be able to purchase the NFTs from the 16th of June onwards, with each NFT priced at $42,000. Treasure Trunk NFT holders will also receive a physical replica of their Treasure Trunk. This will unlock exclusive access to upcoming Louis Vuitton products and exclusive immersive events. The luxury brand also plans to release further limited-edition experiences and products regularly. Part Of A Larger Project The collection is part of a larger initiative by Louis Vuitton called Via, from the Latin word for road. Treasure Trunk NFT owners can also purchase digital keys and gain access to future Louis Vuitton NFT collections. Furthermore, the Treasure Trunk NFTs and future NFTs will be sold as soulbound tokens. This means holders will not be able to transfer them to others once they have been purchased. Holders will also not be able to sell their Treasure Trunks. Louis Vuitton’s Foray Into Blockchain And NFTs The luxury brand has been expanding its presence in the blockchain ecosystem for several years. In 2019, its parent entity, LVMH, announced plans to roll out the Aura blockchain to help with the tracking of luxury goods. In 2021, Louis Vuitton announced a partnership with fellow luxury brands Prada and Cartier to create the Aura Blockchain Consortium. The primary aim of this consortium was to crack down on counterfeit products. It also released a free-to-play game called “Louis The Game,” offering players the chance to win 30 NFTs to celebrate the brand’s 200th birthday. Several other brands have also looked at experimenting with NFTs and blockchain. Balmain has been developing an NFT-backed club exclusively for its niche customers.

42410444,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdWw0O,1686134484,"Crypto Tokens' Status as Securities or Commodities Is Key to SEC's Binance, Coinbase Suits: Bernstein","Whether cryptocurrency tokens are securities or commodities is at the heart of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s allegations against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase (COIN), Bernstein said in a research report Tuesday.  The first judicial clarity on the matter will come from the SEC’s action against Ripple, the report said. A potential judgement on that case is expected later this year and will set the tone for the industry in the near term.  The regulator said on Monday that it was suing Binance, Binance founder and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and the operating company for Binance.US on allegations of violating federal securities laws. A day later it sued rival exchange Coinbase on similar charges.  Crypto regulation has become a “completely political debate between Republicans and Democrats,” Bernstein said.  “The intent seems to build a functional framework for digital commodities and payments stablecoins – providing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) more regulatory authority than the SEC,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  Given that the CFTC had already sued Binance alleging misconduct for attracting U.S. investors to its offshore derivatives platform, it was expected the SEC would follow, alleging securities violation and therefore implying that most tokens are securities.  The U.S. regulatory action is unfortunate, but not an “existential” risk, Bernstein said.  Most capital that had to leave the cryptocurrency market is already out, and the bad news appears to be fully priced in, with both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) trading up by around 3% after the event, the report said.

The acquisition aligned with the recent relaunch of BLK DNM as a modern, community-driven fashion house. It marks ChromaWay’s first acquisition of an established company for the purpose of implementing real-world decentralization: i.e., creating positive behavioral change, fairer access, and more control by users within traditional industries. ChromaWay’s blockchain capabilities will be integrated into BLK DNM’s strategy and products, the first meaningful use of the tech in fashion. In pioneering ‘connected fashion,’ BLK DNM will seek to inspire more responsible behaviors in the industry. First tech innovations will be announced ahead of BLK DNM’s F/W 2023 collections reveal First innovations to be revealed in BLK DNM’s F/W 2023: ChromaWay’s blockchain capabilities will be integrated in a revolutionary way into both BLK DNM’s brand and products. BLK DNM will consequently become a pioneer of ‘connected fashion’ - the use of technology to create community and responsibility within fashion - heralding the first significant use of blockchain tech in an industry yet to be meaningfully impacted by Web3 technologies. BLK DNM will reveal the first tranche of technological innovations built on ChromaWay’s ‘Chromia’ relational blockchain in the coming weeks. This will include software- and hardware-based innovations built into BLK DNM’s F/W 2023 collections, underpinned by the ethical and communal concept of ‘connected fashion.’ Toni Collin, CEO of BLK DNM, and Henrik Hjelte, CEO and Co-founder of ChromaWay Henrik Hjelte, CEO and Co-founder of ChromaWay, comments: “BLK DNM is a brand with an ethical mission and decentralization in its soul - it’s something of a borderless community already. It was a natural fit for our aspirations to transform the fashion industry through innovation. BLK DNM’s imminent tech rollout will illustrate the power of our blockchain capabilities to create true behavioral change in an industry that has hitherto struggled to control its problematic environmental impact and embrace progress.”Toni Collin, CEO of BLK DNM, comments: “Our industry must start looking toward innovation: fast fashion’s environmental impact is totally unacceptable, and at the same time, as the world becomes more digitized, the concept of community is changing. That’s why BLK DNM joining ChromaWay is so exciting. The potential of this technology to create genuine change in fashion is evident, but no one else in the industry is using it in a meaningful way yet. Together, BLK DNM and ChromaWay are building something truly unique and groundbreaking. We will be able to reveal the first innovations very soon.” About ChromaWay ChromaWay is an industry leader in blockchain technology and specializes in creating and deploying cutting-edge, scalable blockchain solutions for businesses and governments.

Gho has been available on the Ethereum blockchain’s Goerli testnet since February, where it has functioned without encountering any major bugs.  In a governance post on Tuesday, developer Aave Companies proposed the V3 Ethereum Facilitator – to allow for gho lending against collateral deposits – and the FlashMinter Facilitator – a variant of flash loans, or loans that are issued against zero collateral.  These facilitators, which can be protocols or entities, have the ability to generate and burn GHO tokens up to a certain limit, enabling depositors to borrow GHO against their collateral deposited in Aave V3's Ethereum mainnet pool.  Both facilitators were approved in outline earlier. A voting schedule for the more detailed proposals, which are in the discussion phase, has yet to be set.  The FlashMinter Facilitator will allow users to borrow GHO and repay it in a single transaction and have an initial capacity of 2 million GHO on zero fees.  Gho was first proposed in June last year as a decentralized stablecoin backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies chosen at the discretion of Aave users, while borrowers would continue earning interest on their underlying collateral.  The token is expected to generate additional revenue for the Aave decentralized autonomous organization by sending 100% of interest payments on GHO borrows to the DAO, the proposal said at the time. It will initially be on Ethereum, and is expected to be issued on other blockchains based on community demand and voting, according to the proposals.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/07/aave-lending-protocol-moves-closer-to-launching-gho-stablecoin-on-ethereum-mainnet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/183bfe59f68de08aee8f2ff5ce53d9ee5826c86d-3085x1735.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

These include the Circle Account, which allows institutional customers to access USDC.

Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder and CEO of Circle, stated that the company was committed to being an integral part of Singapore’s economy and was honored to receive the Major Payment Institution (MPI) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). “Singapore is integral to Circle’s global expansion and mission in raising global economic prosperity and through the frictionless exchange of value. We are honored to receive the MPI license from MAS, and we remain committed to being a part of Singapore’s dynamic economy by advancing the future of financial technology innovations in the city-state, uplifting its emerging technology and fintech sector, and creating business and career opportunities for its technology and financial industry talent.” MPI License Underscores Circle’s Strong Reputation In a press release, Circle stated that receiving the Major Payment Institution License highlighted Circle’s strong reputation as a responsible digital financial company.

Now that it is a licensed entity, Circle Singapore can look to leverage its expertise and drive innovation fully. It can also expand its offerings and deliver value to clients and stakeholders.

While the allegations are different - Coinbase centers around the registration of securities and market functions, while Binance includes fraud and efforts to evade - the two are similar in other ways. The cases should provide more clarity around crypto rules, as well as the scope and authority of regulators over crypto platforms. Bigger picture: In the early innings of the crypto experiment or revolution (depending on who you ask), digital asset firms took a similar approach to traditional companies that make waves with innovation. In some respects, it was like the emergence of gig workers, or the gig economy, which steamrolled through tax and labor laws until things were eventually regulated. A similar view - that regulation would bend to innovation - was adopted early on in the crypto craze, but more recently it has become apparent that this is not going to happen. ""The investing public has the benefit of U.S. securities laws, crypto should be no different, and these platforms and intermediaries need to come into compliance,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler declared. ""Frankly, the public should really be more careful... We don't need more digital currency. We already have digital currency. It's called the U.S. dollar. It's called the euro or it's called the yen, they're all digital right now."" Back in March, Coinbase ( COIN ) received a Wells notice for a potential enforcement action from the SEC, though the company said the agency refused to respond to its proposals regarding registration. In April, Coinbase ( COIN ) even sued the SEC seeking to force a response on its rulemaking petition, while the CFTC subsequently accused Binance of breaching certain trading and derivatives rules . The latest lawsuits cement regulators' jurisdiction over the crypto industry using federal securities laws and investor protections, instead of an expansion of the rulebook or updated framework strongly sought out by crypto proponents. Outlook: Investors sent shares of Coinbase ( COIN ) plunging 12% on Tuesday after considerable foreshadowing in the months prior. In the article, The Downtrend Could Be Stronger Than You Think , SA Investing Group Leader Danil Sereda called the extended slump - following the SEC enforcement action in March - and followed up with another piece Coinbase Stock: Don't Fight The SEC at the beginning of May. Coinbase's woes don't end with legal trouble. The company recently reported its fifth consecutive quarterly loss , while suffering nearly $1.3B of net customer outflows following yesterday's lawsuit.

These sizable movements of funds on the network have caught the attention of market observers, prompting speculation about the motives and actions of cryptocurrency whales. The catalyst behind this flurry of activity appears to be the recent lawsuit filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance and Coinbase. As regulatory uncertainties loom over the industry, the surge in large transactions on Polygon has become a key indicator of the strategies employed by these investors. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Investors Go All-In: 338 Billion Token Accumulation Signals Bullish Cue Surge In Large Transactions On Polygon Network Raises Speculation Large transactions within the cryptocurrency market are often viewed as indicative of whales’ actions, serving as a glimpse into the strategies they are formulating. According to IntoTheBlock, an on-chain analytics firm, large transactions are defined as those exceeding $100,000. The firm reports a notable surge in the volume of large transactions on the Polygon network, reaching $64.44 million, which represents a staggering 742% increase within the last 24 hours. The surge in large transactions on Polygon occurs against the backdrop of a broader cryptocurrency market downturn. Following the SEC’s actions against the major crypto exchanges, most cryptocurrencies have experienced declines. As regulatory uncertainties loom over the industry, market sentiment has been dampened, leading to widespread selling pressure and a decline in prices across various digital assets. MATIC market cap currently at $7.4 billion. Chart: TradingView.com As of the time of writing, Polygon’s native token, MATIC, is trading at $0.804240, based on CoinGecko data. Over the past 24 hours, MATIC has witnessed a 2.8% decline, while the past seven days have seen a notable slump of 9.6%.

SEC Targets Coinbase Following Binance Lawsuit In a sequence of regulatory actions, the SEC has filed a lawsuit against Coinbase, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in San Francisco. The legal action comes just a day after the regulator sued Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, for alleged securities violations. According to the SEC’s statement released on Tuesday, the regulatory body accuses Coinbase of unlawfully facilitating the buying and selling of crypto asset securities, generating billions of dollars in revenue since at least 2019.

13206518,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-unfazed-by-sec-lawsuit,1686128220,Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Unfazed By SEC Lawsuit,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has welcomed the SEC lawsuit against his exchange, stating that a court battle will help establish much-needed clarity around crypto rules and regulations. The CEO expressed complete confidence in the exchange’s legal team and the facts and the law around crypto. A Chance For Better Clarity Coinbase CEO Armstrong appeared unfazed in the face of a new lawsuit against the exchange by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Both Coinbase and its CEO issued separate statements discussing Coinbase’s views and chances of victory against the latest legal battle against the regulator. In a tweet shared on Tuesday, Armstrong stated that Coinbase would be proud to represent the crypto ecosystem against the SEC, adding that a court battle was probably required to get some much-needed clarity around crypto and the rules governing it. “Regarding the SEC complaint against us today, we’re proud to represent the industry in court to finally get some clarity around crypto rules. We’ll get the job done. In the meantime, let’s all keep moving forward and building as an industry. America will get this right in the end.” Armstrong added that the Securities and Exchange Commission had reviewed Coinbase’s business and allowed it to become a public company in 2021. He also added that the exchange does not list securities, rejecting a vast number of assets that they review. Armstrong also talked about conflicting statements emerging from the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), adding that they can’t agree among themselves on what is a security and what is a commodity. “There is no path to “come in and register” - we tried, repeatedly - so we don’t list securities. We reject the vast majority of assets we review. The SEC and CFTC have made conflicting statements and don’t even agree on what is a security and what is a commodity.” Why Is The SEC Suing Coinbase? The SEC sued Coinbase, alleging that the New York-based crypto exchange broke US securities laws by offering unregistered securities. The lawsuit alleged that Coinbase never registered as a clearing agency, broker, or national securities exchange. The regulator further alleged that several crypto tokens offered by the exchange, including prominent assets such as Polygon (MATIC), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and several others, qualified as securities. The lawsuit also alleges that Coinbase has been operating as an unregistered security broker since 2019, two years before its initial public offering. A Tetchy Relationship Coinbase and Armstrong have been extremely critical of the SEC for failing to draft clear rules and clarifying how securities laws apply to the crypto industry. The crypto space has long requested clarification about which digital assets would qualify as securities and which as commodities. Coinbase had sued the SEC in April when the latter failed to respond to a petition by Coinbase to provide rules governing digitally traded securities. At the time, the SEC stated that crypto already had clear rules and regulations to govern it and responded to the suit by arguing for dismissal on the 5th of May. In response, Coinbase filed a mandamus reply supporting its suit against the SEC. The United States Congress is looking to introduce crypto-specific legislation, which could lend some clarity to the situation. For the moment, Coinbase and the Securities and Exchange Commission are entangled in separate legal proceedings against each other. Coinbase Committed To Regulatory Compliance Coinbase also provided stats to prove that it is committed to regulatory compliance and failure on the SEC’s part to cooperate. The exchange stated that it had mentioned “staking” 57 times in its S1 report, which the SEC approved. It also added that it met the SEC privately to seek guidance on how to stay legally compliant. The exchange criticized the SEC, stating that it had established no rules pertaining to crypto and relied on a test written in 1946 (Howey test) to determine if assets are securities. However, others have pointed out that the SEC had made it clear in its approval that it did not necessarily approve the legality of the exchange’s underlying business. “To the folks posting that it’s unfair that the SEC is filing an action when they approved the Coinbase IPO, please stop. @coinbase was warned that approval of the registration statement didn’t mean approval of the underlying business activity.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42410453,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdWwNX,1686127722,"Bitcoin, Dogecoin Lead Bounce in Crypto Majors Day After Record 8-Month Liquidations","Crypto markets inched higher on Wednesday as traders shook off the regulatory troubles of Binance and Coinbase (COIN), two of the largest crypto exchanges by trading volumes, in a move that suggested bullish strength for major tokens.  Bitcoin (BTC) and dogecoin (DOGE) rose 5% in the past 24 hours to lead gains among majors. Litecoin (LTC), XRP and shiba inu (SHIB) jumped as much as 4%, while the total crypto market capitalization rose 3.3% to $1.12 trillion.  The bounce reversed losses for traders reeling from a record liquidation event on Monday, when over $293 million worth of token-tracked futures products were liquidated.  Liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  The reversal came as traders likely shook off long-term implications of regulatory troubles for influential exchanges in the U.S, with some tokens termed as a security. A security is a negotiable financial instrument that represents some type of financial value, usually in the form of a stock, bond, or option.  In separate filings on Monday and Tuesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Binance and Coinbase with selling of unlicensed securities in the country. The charges came despite a lack of regulatory clarity from the SEC on whether crypto tokens can be considered securities. The SEC has not given any official legal definitions to token issuers and is yet to respond to a petition from Coinbase seeking clear rulemaking definitions.  BNB coin (BNB), Solana's SOL, Cardano's ADA and Polygon's MATIC, tokens alleged as securities in multiple filings earlier this week reversed losses as well, but were ultimately trading at a 3% haircut compared to Tuesday.  As such, some market observers suggested that crypto majors termed as securities in the SEC filings could see near-term turbulence.  “We’ve seen somewhat of a bloodbath for altcoins. Most likely this is due to the fact the SEC’s lawsuits name a basket of altcoins as securities, while not categorizing bitcoin and ether in the same class,” said Jeff Mei, COO of crypto exchange BTSE, in an emailed statement. “And in general crypto traders seem to be fleeing to the relative safety of the top cryptos by market cap.”  “It’s possible we’ll continue to see this bifurcation of crypto markets, with the blue-chip bitcoin and ether holding ground, but with continued uncertainty for the majority of altcoins,” Mei added.  Some say the filings strengthened the value proposition of bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency, alongside the second largest cryptocurrency ether (ETH), was not explicitly termed as a security by the SEC.  “The fact that the SEC did not mention bitcoin anywhere in its filings against Binance and Coinbase also underscores the SEC’s previously stated position that bitcoin is not a security and thereby not under the agency’s purview,” shared Alex Adelman, CEO of bitcoin rewards app Lolli, in a statement to CoinDesk.  “The agency’s enforcement actions against select tokens as unregistered securities may continue to work in bitcoin’s favor, as investors increasingly shift their capital into bitcoin as a fundamentally secure, sound, and independent store of value,” Adelman opined.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE,BTC | DOGE | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/07/bitcoin-dogecoin-lead-bounce-in-crypto-majors-day-after-record-8-month-liquidations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77b9be46f121aff1bed4aa4fc81646dc4bcad465-1918x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

About TRON DAO TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps. Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of June 2023, it has over 164.8 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 5.78 billion total transactions, and over $12.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.

In the filings, the regulator detailed evidence hundreds of millions of dollars in profiteering by the crypto exchange.  The SEC on Monday sued Binance’s U.S. and global entities, alongside its CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, alleging that they had operated unregistered securities exchange by allowing people to trade crypto. The regulator has since sought to freeze Binance.US assets.  The agency internally ordered the investigation and designated officials to take testimony on August 17, 2020, said a court filing by SEC lawyer Colby Steele.  “The investigation concerned, among other things, possible violations of the federal securities laws by BAM Trading Services Inc,” Steele said, citing the company which does business as Binance.US.  A further filing by SEC accountant Sachin Verma said BAM Trading had generated $411 million in revenue for a period covering slightly over four years, a period in which he also calculated $225 million in gross profit. As it is not listed on a stock market the company has usually maintained relative secrecy over its financial affairs.  In a statement tweeted on Monday, Binance.US said it had engaged with the SEC in good faith for nearly two and a half years, but added that the lawsuit was “baseless… unjustified by the facts, by the law, or by the Commission’s own precedent.""

ARK bought 419,324 shares of Coinbase, worth around $21.6 million based on Tuesday's closing price of $51.61. The buy was split across ARK's Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), the Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW), and the Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKF).

In April, Coinbase filed an Administrative Procedure Act challenge asking the court to force the SEC's hand and get the regulator to respond to its 2022 petition for formal rulemaking in the digital assets sector, arguing that the existing requirements are ill-suited for digital assets.  Now, the SEC has been ordered to explain within 7 days if it intends to decline Coinbase’s request, the reasons for such a decision, or a timeline of when it expects to come to a decision.  “Rules of the road, from legislation or rulemaking or both, must come before enforcement actions. That is why we petitioned the SEC for rulemaking nearly a year ago in the first place,” Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, said in a tweet thread.  All this comes as the SEC sues Coinbase over allegations that it operates an unregistered securities exchange.  “We continue to believe that the SEC could not be proceeding with litigation against our industry, like the case filed against us today, if the SEC had not already decided to deny our petition for rulemaking,” Grewal tweeted.  The SEC also needs to explain why the court shouldn't keep overseeing the case and why the SEC shouldn’t provide Coinbase with regular updates on rulemaking as asked.  “If the SEC’s answer to our petition for rulemaking is “no,” then they are required by law to tell us, because we have the legal right to question that “no” in court.

Dogecoin, SHIBA INU, and the recent Pepecoin ($PEPE) are a few of the top-selling meme coins in the crypto space. These coins have gained thousands in price surges in the shortest period. Offering investors ample opportunities to make significant profits based on a small investment. The trending meme coin, $PEPE, barely a month after its release, reached a whopping $1.5 billion in market cap. And a Spot Trading volume exceeding $2.7 billion. This value, according to various reports, rivaled Bitcoin’s Spot Trading on the top crypto exchanges within the same timeframe. A testament to these coins’ ability to generate gargantuan returns for investors. $PEPE’s initial price at the time of launch was a mere $0.000000001 and with a total token supply of over 420 trillion. Since listing on top exchanges, the meme coin experienced a price surge of over 3000%. While it has suffered countless sell-offs from early investors looking to make huge profits, Pepecoin is still ranked as one of the top 100 coins (number 78) based on market cap, per CoinMarketCap. Again, substantial proof of its unprompted leap in price in the shortest time possible. The Role of Exchanges and How Early Listing Impact Investors’ Returns Crypto exchanges enable the seamless purchase of Bitcoin, altcoins, and meme coins alike. They are committed to providing customers with the hottest coins on the market, allowing them to become early investors. Now, why crypto exchanges are core components of the industry, obviously, their effect on the market continues to grow daily, partly a work of meme coins. How? These crypto exchanges understand the influence meme coins have on the market and investors. Hence why they are constantly on the lookout for the next hot project. To better understand the impact of early listing and how these exchanges actively influence investors’ returns, we’ll use $PEPE and LBank, and other exchanges as examples. Via LBank’s Articles Section, the global crypto exchange announced its decision to list the newly launched meme coin, $PEPE on its platform. Per the source above, the listing was scheduled for April 18, 2023, at 8 AM (UTC). LBank claimed the meme coin was a feasible, high-quality coin for its users. 12 days later, OKX Exchange announced its decision to list $PEPE. The result? An 850% surge in price. LBank users enjoyed a whopping 850% increase in their investment. Bitget Exchange also listed $PEPE the same day as LBank and since then (until the time of writing) has raked in returns exceeding a 5346% increase in price for investors. Substantial proof of early listing’s impact on investments. Besides $PEPE, the listing of emerging meme coins like $PSYOP, $GEN, $SPONGE, $AIDOGE, $BEN, and $RFD further shows the role exchanges play in price surges. According to available market data, LBank, MEXC, and HUOBI are at the forefront of early token listings. For the previously mentioned emerging meme coins, LBank was the first to list 5 out of the 6 tokens—$BEN, $PSYOP, $RFD, $GEN, and $SPONGE. With MEXC Exchange listing $AIDOGE first and HUOBI following behind. In line with this data, LBank also recorded the highest gains for these meme coins, except for $AIDOGE and $BEN where MEXC recorded the highest gains. LBank Exchange: $PEPE; 6387% $AIDOGE; 19364% $BEN; 313% $PSYOP; 433% $RFD; 216% $SPONGE; 296% $GEN; 716% MEXC Exchange $PEPE; 2259% $AIDOGE; 70429% $BEN; 353% $PSYOP; 0% $RFD; 138% $SPONGE; 0% $GEN; None HUOBI and Gate.io recorded impressive gains—2710% and 2324%, respectively—for $PEPE. However, listing a day after LBank and Bitget cost their users over 2300% value increases on their investments. How Meme Coins are Driving Unconventional Innovation As these crypto exchanges compete against themselves by constantly searching for potentially hot coins, one thing stands out—their willingness to openly embrace unconventional projects. By actively seeking out new projects to list, crypto exchanges show their commitment to supporting peculiar projects. Although meme coins are loosely based on famous memes, animals, or characters, they have become an avenue for experimentation in the web3 space. Meme coins are continually pushing the boundaries of conventional investments and attracting a diverse audience. Comprising a community of exuberant individuals committed to contributing to the growth of a project. By fervently seeking the next big meme coin, exchanges are encouraging developers to keep experimenting and launching unique projects. Additionally, the rise of these meme coins is proof of the impact of the internet and meme culture. Memes have become a huge part of the internet and social media experience. And by listing meme-based coins, exchanges are tapping into a potentially replete environment with millions of global supporters waiting to be onboarded. Speaking about these meme coins and how they're opening doors for mass adoption, Johnasson Chen, co-founder of LBank reiterates that the pursuit of meme coins contributes to the resilience and diversity of the emerging web3 ecosystem. “Staying on top of the market for memes is crucial to delivering top-notch investments to our users as early as possible. The pursuit of meme coins also contributes to the overall diversity and resilience of the Web3 ecosystem. The inclusion of such coins alongside more established cryptocurrencies fosters a healthy balance between established projects and innovative newcomers, allowing for a continuous cycle of disruption and growth,” the co-founder said.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $27,200, up 4.3% over the past 24 hours. BTC sank near $25,400 on Monday in the hours after the SEC announced a lawsuit against Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. But bitcoin started edging upward by the end of the day and continued its path even as the SEC announced a second lawsuit against Binance rival Coinbase on Tuesday, and later in the day, asked a Federal court to grant a temporary restraining order to freeze assets tied to Binance.US.  “The fact that the market has rebounded leads me to believe that this was at least partially priced in,” Joshua Franklin, CEO and co-founder of digital asset information services platform The Tie, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “No one is surprised by Gensler's actions.”  Read More:Coinbase Traders Withdraw $600M in a Day Amid SEC Lawsuits  Ether also spent much of Tuesday on the upswing to trade near $1,900, a 4% gain from Monday, same time.

ADA and SOL, the tokens of smart contracts platforms Cardano and Solano, regained slivers of ground lost amid lawsuit aftershocks with the former rising about a half a percentage point and the latter more than 1%. Layer 2 platform Polygon’s MATIC was down about 1.5%. In its filing, the SEC identified those tokens among 13 as unregistered securities.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto market performance, was up 4.8%.  Fueled by AI euphoria and recent gains among several tech giants, including chipmaker Nvidia, the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 both rose slightly with the former hitting its highest point in 10 months and the latter in more than a year.  The Tie’s Franklin noted that institutional investors remain ambivalent months after crypto exchange FTX’s spectacular collapse in November and the increasingly harsh U.S. regulatory environment.  Read More: SEC's Latest Crackdown Could Drive Crypto Firms Out of the U.S.  “Many funds that invested in FTX got burned, and some partners that led their firms' FTX deals were fired,” Franklin wrote. As a result, many VCs are feeling nervous to enter crypto. There is a similar trepidation among institutional allocators like pensions and endowments that broadly were burned on their earlier crypto allocations.”  Franklin added that even hedge funds that were not-too-long ago accelerating their participation in the crypto space faster than any other institutional group, have also applied “the brakes,” amid concerns about regulation, a lack of credit and “viable venues to trade on in the U.S.,” limited custody options and angst about doing business with digital asset firms that may not survive in the wider crypto contagion.

Weeks prior, internal control issues took center stage in a Reuters report accusing it of commingling customer and company funds, which the company's chief communications officer has refuted.  Comparing and contrasting the accusations that Binance co-mingled funds with those against FTX, which also co-mingled funds, might be tempting.  However, these comparisons are superficial. While they could both be described as co-mingling, the process and implications are different.  In its complaint, the SEC suggests that billions of dollars of customer funds were accessible to entities connected to Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, namely market makers Merit Peak and Sigma Chain. Among the allegations from the SEC, $200 million was reportedly transferred from BAM Trading, a Binance-related entity, to Sigma Chain, another entity controlled by CZ, and a Binance bank account sent CZ $62.5 million.  If true, it’s hard to call this anything but co-mingling.  But missing here is any mention of BNB, its native exchange token.  Center to FTX’s co-minging problem is FTT, and how it played a role at Alameda Research.  As CoinDesk reported last November, a large portion of Alameda's assets consisted of FTT tokens, which were issued by FTX. This arrangement raised massive questions about the interconnectedness of the two entities, particularly given that the value of the FTT token is partly sustained by FTX's own activities.  Alameda, a market maker and investor, was a material stakeholder in the crypto economy at the time; thus, the market was dutifully concerned about how much of Alameda’s investing power was printed out of thin air.  This isn’t the case for BNB. Binance isn’t an investor like Alameda was, and BNB doesn’t compose the material portion of anyone’s balance sheet.  Sure, Sam Bankman-Fried also later admitted to not segregating customer accounts, which later formed part of the prosecutors’ case against him. And this sounds a lot like what CZ is being accused of. However, Binance's accusations revolve more around the alleged diversion of customer funds and interference in U.S. operations, while the issues with FTX/Alameda pertain to blurred lines between the two entities and the non-segregation of customer funds.  Similar, but different things.  And we’ll see in the coming weeks how much of CZ’s empire this takes out.  Important events.
