'Crypto Dad' Says Soon,"Former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo, aka ""Crypto Dad,"" sees the current set of financial systems – the older systems associated with the pre-digital age – as hopelessly obsolete. He aims to fix them.      “During my five years at the commission we saw this sort of new wave of the digitization of our world that's taking place,” he said. “The first wave was the digitization of information, and that's created the Internet as we know it today. But we’re seeing what some people call the digitization of value, or the or the Internet of value.”      Giancarlo recently called for the creation of the digital dollar and is working with former LabCFTC head Daniel Gorfine to experiment and ultimately ship a framework for a truly digital version of the currency.      “I've been also thinking a lot about how so much of our physical infrastructure – our bridges, our tunnels, our airports – have been allowed to age and decay. They were state of the art in the fifties and sixties. They are well past their sell-by day today,” he said. “So much of our financial infrastructure has also been allowed to age and decay and not been modernized.”      Since leaving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Giancarlo has joined the Chamber of Digital Commerce as an advisor and also joined the board of the American Financial Exchange. During his time with the CFTC, Giancarlo called for a lighter regulatory approach when it came to cryptocurrencies.      Now, sitting down with CoinDesk's Michael Casey at the LATOKEN Blockchain Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the former chairman is ready to expand the definition of digital currencies in the United States.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | FIAT | TRADING,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/03/when-will-we-see-the-digital-dollar-crypto-dad-says-soon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/475243af509b39d2df45b5f9f21c261b3d37f974-1921x1081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

What Brexit means for the crypto community - practically and metaphorically.    Find past episodes of The Breakdown on CoinDesk.

42383245,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uqHp,1580752828,Aztec Launches Privacy Network on Ethereum,"Aztec has launched its privacy network on ethereum, providing users with what it said is a cost-efficient solution for keeping transactions private.      Aztec CEO Thomas Walton-Pocock said in a blog post Friday those using the system will be able to transact with private ethereum-based assets. Using the same zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) as zcash, the protocol has also launched a privacy software development kit (SDK) that allows users to mint their own private assets.      Initially available with dai, Aztec plans to add support for other ethereum-based assets over the next six weeks, according to Walton-Pocock. The team wants to allow users to make their own completely private custom assets by the end of March.      The Aztec protocol uses the zk-SNARKs privacy algorithm to encrypt blockchain data. Its London-based team claim it works more efficiently and at a lower cost than many existing alternative solutions. It is also intended to be used by banks: JPMorgan's blockchain team trialed Aztec during a series of ZKP tests in February 2018.      The ethereum startup incubator ConsenSys led a $2.1 million funding round for Aztec in November 2019.      Ethereum transactions are easy to trace. Although users don't usually input personal information, analytics firms like Chainalysis have been able to develop sophisticated tracking solutions for enforcement agencies that utilizes data freely available on the public blockchain.      Walton-Pocock said Aztec is still on course to offer its ""triptych of privacy."" In its next phase, the team plans to introduce user privacy to prevent third parties from determining user identities; it will then develop a technique to keep smart contracts private.      Aztec isn't the first protocol offering private transactions in the ethereum ecosystem.

42383243,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uqFJ,1580745633,Minecraft Players Can Win Bitcoin on New Treasure Hunt Server,"A new Minecraft server allows players in the blocky universe to compete against one another to find hidden treasure and receive a bitcoin reward.      Known as SatoshiQuest, the challenge is to find the hidden loot within ""vast Minecraft landscapes."" Users pay $1 in bitcoin for an in-game life. Entry fees are collected and most will go towards a specific treasure wallet address, which is awarded to the player who finds the loot first.      In order to participate, users set up their own in-game wallet they can use to pay for lives and receive their winnings. Should they wish, they can also connect an external wallet to the Minecraft game server.      More than 180 million copies of Minecraft have been sold since late 2019, making it the single best-selling video game in history. It allows users to create their own worlds on their own servers. The game has already featured bitcoin, with the BitQuest and PlayMC servers, from 2014 and 2015 respectively, which both integrated the original cryptocurrency to test and educate users about digital currencies.      The first round of SatoshiQuest began on Jan. 26 and the game resets once treasure has been found. The server checks the bitcoin spot price every 15 minutes, automatically updating the participation fee to keep it at $1.      The project is open source, with the code available on GitHub.      Ninety percent of total game fees go towards the treasury address, with the remaining 10 percent going towards developer costs. After finding the treasure, winners receive 85 percent of the balance, while the remaining 5 percent is kept the wallet until the next round. The reward is only paid out if the treasury wallet balance exceeds the transaction fee.      The Minecraft contest comes after another more real-world bitcoin treasure hunt was launched last April. Called Satoshi’s Treasure, the game's developers hid the keys to $1 million-worth of bitcoin across the globe.      The keys to the bitcoin wallet containing the prize were divided into 1,000 fragments, requiring a minimum of 400 key fragments to access and transfer the funds.

42383244,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uqGZ,1580742300,What Are China’s Goals Behind Its Digital Yuan?,"Michael Sung, a professor at Shanghai’s Fudan University, spoke to CoinDesk’s Michael Casey on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The topic? The intertwined growth of digital currency and blockchain projects in China.      How big a deal is it? And what are they actually doing? Sung had some surprising answers.      “So I think the world kind of noticed on Oct. 24 when [Chinese President] Xi Jinping stood up and basically announced two major things for that week,” said Sung. “First, there was something called the fourth plenary sessions for the CPC (Chinese Communist Party). It’s is one of the most important high-level government meetings to decide the strategy of what's happening in China. Then they said they're going live with the digital currency that they had been in planning since 2014.”      Sung had been following the new currency project for nearly half a decade as the Chinese Communist Party has built out plans for a country-wide digital solution. The party accelerated that project, he believes, as a direct reaction to Facebook’s Libra.      “Because of the Libra situation, Mu Changchun, who is the head of the official Digital Currency Research Institute, ran back to Beijing and held a special workshop for all the Communist officials and decided, ‘OK, get in front of this.’ But actually, in my opinion, that was the lesser of the news happened that week,” he said.      “The second piece of news was Xi Jinping announcing the country’s blockchain strategy,” said Sung. This was far more meaningful because, Sung noted, the president himself announced the digital yuan. In China, said Sung, this puts an official imprimatur on the plans and will make other governments take notice.      “This means it’s serious business and I think the implications of this blockchain strategy will be felt around the world because what it indicates [is] that China has developed a national strategy,” he said. “All the big players are trying to get in the game. But this is signaling that the central government [is] stepping in and sort of taking a central role.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | RESEARCH,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/03/what-are-chinas-goals-behind-its-digital-yuan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5008e6a243dcc8e02a6153211d7e9e1ea8ae5323-1902x1188.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383239,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uqAH,1580742059,PoolTogether DeFi App Announces $1M Investment After No-Loss Lottery Payout Tops $1K,"One lucky DAI holder won over $1,400 on PoolTogether Friday, reaching a new order of magnitude in prize payouts for risk-averse gamblers.      A so-called ""no-loss lottery,"" deposits to the decentralized finance (DeFi) project have been growing fast since its September 2019 launch. PoolTogether’s DAI pool also hit $1 million in locked-in crypto for the first time Friday.      Reflecting that success, the company is announcing a $1.05 million investment round under a simple agreement for future equity. IDEO CoLab Ventures led the round; ConsenSys and DTC Capital also invested.      ""Our goal is expanding access to the prize-linked savings protocol,"" Leighton Cusack, the project's founder, told CoinDesk in an email. ""Our hope is that others will begin building on top of the protocol to expand access to a financial primitive we believe has been overlooked thus far in DeFi.""      Cusack described PoolTogether as a bet on ethereum's promise. ""We think the 'last mile' infrastructure on ethereum is finally getting to the point where mainstream users can be on-boarded and we're excited to leverage all the tools the ethereum ecosystem has to offer,"" Cusack said.    How it works    PoolTogether players sacrifice interest they could have earned on holdings of the stablecoin DAI in exchange for a shot at winning the interest of everyone else in the pool.      All the money placed in PoolTogether goes into the Compound protocol where borrowers pay for access to it. The current yield on DAI placed in Compound is 7.81 percent, as of Monday morning.      PoolTogether is attractive to savers for two reasons: because they don't put their principal at risk and because a large portion of the pool is sponsored. Some of the sponsored money comes from PoolTogether and some comes from other organizations that want to encourage participation in the networks the project touches.      In the current pool, about a quarter of the $1,000,000 pool is sponsored, and therefore out of the running for prizes. That chunk of crypto still feeds interest into the prize pot, however, adding to the project’s appeal.      In short, PoolTogether offers a simple way to gamify savings and make it slightly more fun, though there is the very real risk of never winning and merely losing out on the all-but-guaranteed yield from placing your DAI in Compound directly. For small users, though, this yield is negligible.      “We initially became interested in PoolTogether because we found the concept of a global Prized Linked Savings protocol to be both highly compelling as well as something that is uniquely enabled by blockchain technology,” Dan Elitzer, an investor at IDEO CoLab Ventures, told CoinDesk. “We were impressed that even with a very early-stage prototype and the friction of needing to first purchase both ETH and DAI, then send them to a non-custodial wallet like Metamask, they were managing to attract new users into the ecosystem.”      PoolTogether has been experiencing strong growth since its first pool, though it did see a hiccup as MakerDAO made the switch to multi-collateral DAI last November. (Users had to actively switch over to new currency. There are still a tiny number of users in the pool for single-collateral DAI.)      ""We've always felt getting the weekly prize over $1,000 would be a big psychological barrier,"" Cusack wrote. ""The next target we're shooting for is $10,000 prize and we think that will be another big inflection.""      PoolTogether recently updated its business model so that it no longer holds 10 percent of each winning pool, as we previously reported. Cusack told CoinDesk the project is now exploring new business models based on its current growth trajectory.      ""PoolTogether is a unique company that enables entrenched behavior using new crypto primitives and provides a foundation for the emergence of new behavior as a result,"" Min Teo, an investment partner at ConsenSys Labs, told CoinDesk via a spokesperson. ""ConsenSys is excited to support PoolTogether in their work to decentralize the protocol and increase access to this innovative new savings tool.""    New product    With its success so far with DAI, PoolTogether is bringing a new product onto the market: a daily prize powered by USDC, the fiat-backed stablecoin created by Circle and Coinbase.      ""Daily prizes mean you have a higher chance to win over a period of time so it's more favorable to small depositors,"" Cusack explained.      USDC earns 3.91 percent on Compound as of Monday morning. To incentivize players, PoolTogether will seed the new pool with $100,000 worth of USDC that is not eligible for winning. Early entrants likely will have an outsized shot at winning interest on that pile of crypto.      The new daily pool is live now and the first payout will be tomorrow afternoon.      PoolTogether went with USDC because it's the only other stablecoin live on Compound as of now.      ""Ultimately, our goal is that the pools will support multiple stablecoin types in the same pool but the protocol is not there yet,"" Cusack said.

The ""Spider"" crypto routing scheme, according to its developers – including Vibhaalakshmi Sivaraman, a graduate student at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) – offers a more efficient type of payment channel network, or PCN.      Used on ""layer 2"" scaling solutions like bitcoin's lightning network, PCNs allow users to charge accounts with a chosen amount of cryptocurrency. Payments are made across a network of such accounts and only the setting up and closing of the accounts is registered on the blockchain.      This can result in payments that are far faster and more scalable than those made directly on the blockchain, and is touted as a way to make crypto payments more feasible in bricks-and-mortar stores. Bitcoin transactions, for example, currently take on average roughly 11 minutes to be confirmed on the network, though the figure has sometimes peaked at over 15 minutes. Lightning is said to take from milliseconds to seconds, by contrast.      According to a CSAIL report on Spider, PCNs can be slowed by inefficient routing schemes, and often quickly run down users’ accounts, meaning they are forced to top up their funds frequently.      Spider is claimed to be a more efficient way of routing payments, in which participants can invest just a fraction of funds in their account. It's also said to be able to process around four times the number of transactions, compared with other PCNs, before registering the events on the blockchain.      Spider works by splitting transactions into smaller amounts or “packets” that propagate over different channels at varying rates, CSAIL writes. By dividing the amounts into bite-sized chunks, large payments can be routed through accounts that may have low funding levels. Unlike with other systems that will send the full payment and possibly be rejected by accounts with insufficient funds – thus causing delays as the transaction is rerouted – Spider can produce payments that are less likely to clog up the network or fail, its team say.      “Routing money in a way that the funds of both users in each joint account are balanced allows us to reuse the same initial funds to support as many transactions as possible,"" Sivaraman said.      The routing system was inspired by packet switching, a method of efficiently transmitting data over the web.      Another feature of the tech is it allows payments to be queued at congested accounts rather than being rejected, while the team also built an algorithm they say can help spot congested accounts.      In tests looking at how it handles one-directional payments where an account becomes depleted and needs to be topped up on the blockchain, the team says Spider can also outperform other PCN systems.      The researchers aim to present a paper on Spider at the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation later this month.      “It’s important to have balanced, high-throughput routing in PCNs to ensure the money that users put into joint accounts is used efficiently,” said lead author Sivaraman. “This should be efficient and a lucrative business. That means routing as many transactions as possible, with as little funds as possible, to give PCNs the best bang for their buck.”      The research team included other members of CSAIL, as well as Radhika Mittal of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Kathleen Ruan and Giulia Fanti of Carnegie Mellon University.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/03/mit-develops-spider-tech-to-enable-more-efficient-off-chain-crypto-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/569d53cddb51965f316e800ca373a407b2edd8bb-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ajay Banga, who has been the CEO and president of Mastercard since 2009, told the Financial Times his attitude towards Libra deteriorated as project members proposed linking what was supposed to be a globally inclusive currency to a proprietary digital wallet, Calibra.      “It went from this altruistic idea into their own wallet. I’m like: ‘this doesn’t sound right,’"" said Banga.      He said financial inclusion would mean a government is able to pay citizens in a certain currency, which they must be able to understand how to use and must be usable in day-to-day transactions for items like food.      ""If you get paid in Libra [coin] . . . which go into Calibras, which go back into pounds to buy rice, I don’t understand how that works,"" he said.      A lack of a clear business model for Libra raised another red flag for Mastercard. Banga said there were no obvious means for the Libra Association to become profitable or make money from its users. ""When you don’t understand how money gets made, it gets made in ways you don’t like,"" he said.      Banga also had concerns when association members would also not firmly commit to know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) controls or data management controls.      Mastercard left the Libra project alongside its main competitor Visa back in October. Although Mastercard did not say at the time why it had decided to leave, a Visa spokesperson said the company had pulled out because the project had not been able to ""satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations.""      Out of the 28 founding members of Libra, eight have left. British telecom conglomerate Vodafone was the last to leave in January when it decided to focus on its own digital payments service.      Mastercard has adopted a very cautious approach to distributed ledger technology. Although it has sponsored several initiatives that leverage blockchain – most recently a cross-border payments platform together with R3 – the company has a history of skepticism around cryptocurrencies.      Matthew Driver, Mastercard’s president for South-East Asia, said way back in 2014 that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies did not have a clearly defined purpose and could not be trusted as a payment method. In a lecture series in July 2018, Banga described cryptocurrencies as ""junk"" and argued that they should not be considered as a medium of exchange.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/03/mastercard-left-libra-association-over-regulatory-and-viability-concerns-says-ceo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe1cb5153d76d9739f494d8b98400974809f7c72-500x333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Confirmed by an FSIS spokesperson, the $269,450 blockchain feasibility assessment will search out efficiencies in a process marred by regulations and often complex, multi-country documentary requirements. FSIS is responsible for certifying America’s exported meat, poultry and eggs are up to snuff; this means checking them against the U.S.’s standards, and, depending on the destination, other countries’ regimes as well.      FSIS inspectors verify documents, stamps, shipping containers and at least a sample of the export product itself against a broad set of regulations, the inspector training manual shows. The ensuing manual and digital paper trail accompanies products in transit.      The proof-of-concept will assess if blockchain can bring “increased immutability and visibility of critical documentation traversing across the supply chain,” the spokesperson explained, noting the FSIS will start by studying the “export business process.”      “This is the first time that FSIS has sought to utilize blockchain technology,” the spokesperson said.      The IBM-built project is part of FSIS’s wider import-export modernization initiative, according to the FSIS 2020 Annual Plan, where the food regulator first revealed the proof-of-concept’s existence without naming its private-sector partner.      FSIS awarded IBM a nondescript “blockchain proof-of-concept” contract worth nearly $270,000 in August 2019. Its spokesperson confirmed FSIS gave IBM the export certification study last year.      IBM declined to comment.      The contract runs through June 2020. In that time, IBM’s blockchain will help FSIS understand what role the tech might play in the agency’s future, according to the spokesperson, who added:      “The intent of the proof-of-concept is to identify and quantify the potential benefits [of blockchain] so that the agency can make an informed decision on the next steps.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/03/us-food-inspectors-to-test-ibm-blockchain-for-export-certifications,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac8e185f5b5cbe7dea97e868215d351e5d43f66a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383250,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uqQd,1580728500,Bitcoin Price Spikes to 3-Month High as Bull Cross Approaches,"View  Bitcoin's ongoing upward trend still looks strong with the 50- and 100-day averages eyeing their first bullish crossover since March 2019.  The cryptocurrency looks set to test $10,000 over the next few weeks.  A minor pullback to levels below $9,000 may be seen before a stronger rally as the short-duration charts are suggesting bull fatigue.    Bitcoin printed a three-month high on major exchanges early Monday with key indicator eyeing its first bullish turn in 11 months.      Prices rose to $9,615 on Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange during the Asian trading hours. That was the highest level since Oct. 28. The top cryptocurrency also hit a three-month high of $9,628 and $9,615 on Bitfinex and Coinbase, respectively.      Meanwhile, bitcoin’s global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), fell $30 short of Friday’s high of $9,633 – the highest level since the end of October.      Notably, the move higher happened as China’s stock market fell 8 percent in early trading – likely due to the coronavirus outbreak and its potential impact on the nation's economy. The Chinese equity markets were closed last week for the extended New Year holiday.      Futures on the S&P 500, however, remained bid and rose 0.65 percent despite the risk-off mood in the Chinese markets. Traditional safe havens like gold are also facing selling pressure at press time – a sign the broader markets may be done pricing the negative impact of coronavirus on the global economy.      Interestingly, bitcoin’s break above $9,600 was quickly undone with a drop back to $9,250. The cryptocurrency was last seen trading around $9,330, representing a marginal loss on a 24-hour basis.      Despite the pullback from three-month highs, the overall trend remains bullish with the list of technical indicators calling an upside move growing with each passing week.      Soon to join that bandwagon is a bull cross of the 50- and 100-day moving averages (MAs), as seen below.      Daily chart    The 50-day MA is trending north and looks set to cross above the 100-day MA in the next day or two. The resulting bullish crossover would be the first since March 2019.    Bull trap?    MA crossovers are lagging indicators and often trap buyers on the wrong side of the market.      For instance, the 50- and 100-day bull cross observed in June and August 2018 has failed to inspire buyers. However, back then the broader market conditions were bearish – bitcoin topped out at $20,000 in December 2017 and had been charting lower highs ever since.      Such crossovers, however, are widely followed and tend to attract stronger buying pressure when the broader market conditions are looking bullish.      The latest bull cross is accompanied by a bullish higher lows and higher highs setup. Further, key indicators like the weekly MACD histogram and the relative strength index are reporting bullish conditions.      Hence, BTC may see increased chart-driven buying on the back of the bull cross.      As for the next 24 hours, the odds appear stacked in favor of a drop to $9,000.    4-hour and daily charts    The four-hour chart shows bitcoin has been largely restricted to a narrow range of $9,200-$9,600 since Jan. 29.      A convincing move above $9,600 would imply a continuation of the rally from the Jan. 24 low of $8,213 and open the doors to $10,000.      A downside break would expose the psychological support of $9,000. If that level is breached, sellers will likely attack the 200-day MA located at $8,874.      The RSI on the four-hour chart is trending south, indicating scope for a range breakdown. Supporting the bear case is the long upper shadow attached to today’s daily candle.      Dips to the 200-day MA, if any, will likely be short-lived, as longer-term indicators are biased bullish.

42383253,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uqPN,1580726954,Jack Dorsey Enables Bitcoin Emoji on Twitter Posts,"Twitter has activated a new bitcoin-branded hashtag, with founder Jack Dorsey calling for it to become part of the universal web standard.      Dorsey announced Sunday Twitter users could now use the bitcoin symbol as an emoji, appearing automatically after ""#bitcoin"" or ""#btc.""      His tweet also tags the Twitter account for Unicode – the computer text and emoji standard for the internet – possibly pushing for the administrating consortium to introduce an emoji that can be used across all web platforms.      So far, the branded bitcoin hashtag works only for conventional tags and not for the ""$BTC"" tag that is also popular among Twitter users when talking about cryptocurrency trading.      The bitcoin symbol has not been Recommended For General Interchange (RGI), meaning there is no existing emoji that is widely supported across major internet platforms, including the likes of Facebook, LinkedIn as well as Twitter. Dorsey's tweet Sunday suggests he is trying to push Unicode into turning it into an RGI emoji.      Unicode has supported the bitcoin symbol as one of its currency signs since 2017. But there is currently no emoji version, meaning the symbol only appears as a black and white glyph, and not in the orange it is frequently portrayed in.      Twitter charges companies up to $1 million for them to add a branded emoji or symbol after a designated hashtag to help differentiate their branding from that of their competitors, helping to create a buzz amongst consumers.      Popular branded hashtags in the past have been #PokemonLetsGo, which was purchased in late 2018, as well as #Coca-Cola during a marketing campaign in 2015. These are generally temporary, though, lasting only until the end of the marketing campaign.      Dorsey has been a high-profile advocate of cryptocurrency. His payments platform Square has supported bitcoin trading since 2014 and patented a new fiat-crypto payment gateway last month.      Last March, he also set up Square Crypto, a small team dedicated to assisting with development of bitcoin.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/03/jack-dorsey-enables-bitcoin-emoji-on-twitter-posts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3f55112acbe00d0c16f27bee04ef9f8567f49ab-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Monday, iSTOX has graduated from the Singapore central bank’s fintech regulatory sandbox and is set to be one of the first securities token platforms that is licensed as a capital markets services provider, said the platform's operator ICHX Tech.      The platform will provide both institutional investors with issuance, custody and trading services for digitized securities. One of the firm’s goals is to open certain parts of the financial market to more investors, Chief Operating Officer Darius Liu previously told CoinDesk.      Private market opportunities such as equity in series B startups, corporate debt and hedge funds are usually opaque and fragmented for most investors. The new platform will eliminate middlemen and time-consuming settlement time, Liu said.      According to the firm, the Security Token Offerings (STO) available on its platform will offer issuers more options for capital fundraising and investment besides the existing mechanism.      Since ICHX entered MAS’s regulatory sandbox in May 2019, the startup has secured a spate of investments from significant backers in Asia. Its early investors include Singapore Exchange (SGX) and Heliconia, a subsidiary of Singapore’s state-owned conglomerate Temasek Holdings.      The firm later received three other investments including Thai investment bank Kiatnakin Phatra Financial Group, Japanese financial services firm Tokai Tokyo Financial Holdings and South Korean asset manager Hanwha Asset Management.      ICHX also boasts several former financial regulators as members of its board, including Chew Sutat, EVP of SGX, and Chua Kim Leng, a former special advisor to MAS.

42383237,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uq7l,1580720400,"Bitcoin Usage Among Merchants Is Up, According to Data From Coinbase and BitPay","Although bitcoin adoption may move at a glacial pace, merchants are seeing sustained traction regardless of market dips.      According to BitPay Chief Marketing Officer Bill Zielke, the payment processor facilitated $1 billion worth of cryptocurrency transactions in 2019, with bitcoin leading the pack. Likewise, a Coinbase spokesperson said Coinbase Commerce processed $135 million worth of cryptocurrency payments for thousands of merchants in 2019, which represents a 600 percent increase in the number of unique transactions via Coinbase Commerce since 2018.      Ether and various stablecoins make up a small percentage of both of the above-mentioned totals, with Chainalysis reportedly estimating roughly $4 billion in bitcoin alone was sent through payment processors in 2019. As such, Coinbase is looking to build out its merchant services in 2020.      Of course, the number for credit card payments is much higher, dwarfing bitcoin’s $4 billion purchasing power. Credit card purchase volume in 2018 was $3.7 trillion, according to a 2019 report from the U.S. Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.      “In 2020, we’re hyper-focused on providing a complete merchant experience with business features and insights, better serving other geographies with internationalization, adding more currencies, and building seamless integrations that leverage other Coinbase products,” Coinbase Commerce lead Sahil Amoli told CoinDesk.      Among consumer-facing companies, Fold CEO Will Reeves said his shopping app processed more than 2,000 purchases during the 2019 holiday shopping season, out of which 80 percent were Lightning Network transactions.      “Amazon, Starbucks, Sephora were the most gifted brands by lightning users,” Reeves said.      Another option for merchants also emerged on the scene last week, in the form of Zap’s Strike, an application that lets users make U.S. dollar payments via the lightning network.      Tales from the cash register    All things considered, there’s ample reason to be cautiously optimistic about bitcoin usage beyond speculative trading in 2020. However, Lola Luna boutique owner Jean-Michel Daumas, a Coinbase Commerce customer who runs a luxury lingerie business in Paris, warned it’s still too soon to describe bitcoin payments as routine or trendy.      “People are not ready to pay with crypto. They prefer to keep it rather than spend it,” Daumas said. “I prefer to receive payments in crypto because they are more secure for me. For example, when I receive payments from PayPal, some people cheat and say they didn’t receive the goods.”      Daumas said his boutique received more than 90 bitcoin payments since early 2018, never more than four bitcoin payments a month. His customers are 80 percent men spending bitcoin on lingerie as a status symbol, an insight that aligns with BitPay’s findings that jewelry, precious metals and high-end tech products garner the most bitcoin buyers.      “It’s a very high level of fabric, couture-level,” he said. “We sell much more during the Christmas holidays, for example, [which] has much more influence [on the store’s sales trends] than the price of bitcoin.”      Indeed, Lola Luna is best known for statement pieces such as open G-string bottoms with dangling feathers to tickle sensitive areas. Perhaps some shoppers may choose to pay with bitcoin so that a “naked bra” and lace collar set doesn’t show up on a credit card bill. But, given French lingerie culture, Daumas said it’s “too early” to conclude why some shoppers prefer using bitcoin.      For broader context, BitPay’s Zielke said Europe and the Middle East are generally home to the most high-value merchant transactions, while there are more North American shoppers in terms of unique transactions. In the meantime, Daumas prefers to simply transfer the bitcoin earnings to a hardware wallet and hodl.      “I was one of the first global lingerie boutiques on the internet because I’ve always been interested in technology. I remember it was so difficult to build a website,” Daumas said. “It’s the same thing with crypto, that’s where we are now.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/03/bitcoin-usage-among-merchants-is-up-according-to-data-from-coinbase-and-bitpay,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37d3a78fb9cf71994ee209d73a32964c7ea931ce-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a letter submitted by the prosecutor of the case on Jan. 31, Fowler ""rejected the current plea offer"" on Jan. 30 and the U.S. government ""has formally withdrawn that offer."" As such, the parties will move to trial as scheduled on April 28.      Fowler was indicted in April 2019, along with Israeli national Ravid Yosef, by the U.S. government for allegedly, among other charges, running ""shadow bank"" services that are tied to Crypto Capital.      Crypto Capital is a payment processing firm that has facilitated fiat currency onramps for several crypto exchanges including Bitfinex, Kraken and the now-defunct QuadrigaCX, among others.      The payments firm is also involved in another ongoing case filed by the New York Attorney General against Bitfinex and its sister company Tether, which accused the two of using a secret loan to cover a loss that Bitifnex alleged was caused by Crypto Capital.      It was reported in December that Fowler was initially expected to plead guilty to at least some of the charges. According to a Bloomberg report on Feb. 1, the plea deal was for Fowler to admit to one single felony if he would forfeit as much as $371 million.

42383234,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uq3z,1580706000,Winklevoss Patents Tout Use Case for Gemini Stablecoin Tech in Banking,"The owners of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, the Winklevoss brothers, have won a flurry of U.S. patents for stablecoin technology they say could be issued by commercial banks.      Six patents, awarded between August 2019 and January 2020 to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss' intellectual property company, outline a system, similar to the collateralized token model already used by tether and the brothers' Gemini dollar (GUSD), that allows users to directly swap fiat currency for their digital equivalents.      The stablecoin system needs ""trusted entities"" charged with generating, exchanging and destroying the stablecoins, as well as holding the fiat currency collateral on a 1:1 ratio with the number of tokens issued.      A trusted entity could be the Gemini exchange itself, the patent says, but ""other types of trusted entities (e.g., banks, trusts, etc.) may also be used to issue, administer, redeem, and/or otherwise manage"" the stablecoin as well.      One of the patents, awarded Jan. 21, describes a means by which entities, like banks, could create and issue new tokens to users quickly and efficiently. Trusted entities could also be allowed to charge users a ""processing fee"" for minting stablecoins.      The patents also detail a means by which stablecoins could be used as collateral ""in financial transactions that are executed via smart contracts."" Another suggests dividends from securities and other such instruments could be paid out in the stablecoin.    Protecting investments      Last summer, Gemini applied for U.S. broker-dealer license that would allow customers to buy digital securities and receive dividends, all in GUSD. The stablecoin, which launched back in September 2018, has been approved by the New York Department for Financial Services (NYDFS).      Stablecoin providers already use banks to hold customer funds. Boston-based State Street acts as the custodian for the dollar collateral backing the Gemini dollar. In December, the bank announced it would work with Gemini to examine reporting scenarios for cryptocurrencies.      ""Our patent covers the unique way in which the Gemini dollar smart contract interacts with the Gemini exchange,"" Carolyn Vadino, Gemini's head of communications, told CoinDesk. ""Our patents protect the investments we make in the research and development of our products.""      Given the patents' embodiments, it may be possible the system is being considered for licensing it out to banks or other financial institutions. It's also not apparent if Gemini would use the existing GUSD coin or custom tokens based on the same tech.
