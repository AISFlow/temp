By that point, the digital asset was still trading below $20,000 and with market momentum declining, it wasn&apos;t expected that there would be much recovery and Brandt&apos;s chart said as much.

42395258,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXpRC,1657312937,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Gains for Third Consecutive Day as Binance Launches Zero Trading Fees,"Hi, I'm Jimmy He, here to take you through the day's crypto market highlights and news.  Bitcoin was on the rise in Friday trading, even cracking $22,000 at one point early in the day before dipping to its previous day's perch closer to $21,500.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at about $21,800, roughly flat although more on the green side over the past 24 hours.  Bitcoin has enjoyed a rare up week so far, jumping over 14% since Monday, swept up in the same optimism that has carried equities higher this week amid encouraging signs the U.S. Federal Reserve will be undeterred in its battle with inflation. Bitcoin has risen for three consecutive days.  Still, the rally has done little to impress a number of analysts, who have yet to see evidence of a longer-term price surge that would carry bitcoin further beyond the current upper threshold in the low $20,000 range of the past month.  “Since the beginning of the month, BTC/USD has gained more than 17%, which looks like an impressive result but only at first glance,” FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich wrote in an email about the bitcoin/U.S. dollar pair. “The thing is, bitcoin was driven as low as possible by the end of June, and the current remarkable rise is just a recovery to the levels of three weeks ago.”  Kutpsikevich said that BTC is still below its 200-week average and its Friday morning sell-off indicates there is still “a significant supply overhang from sellers.”  Bitcoin is over 50% down from early 2022 levels and over 68% from its all-time high in November 2021.  Analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex said on Friday that the S&P 500’s rally this week and rebounding tech stocks increased risk appetite, supporting BTC's price despite a wave of recent liquidations and solvency issues in the crypto space.  “It will be interesting to see if a buoyant cryptocurrency market over the past 24 hours carries forward into more buying this month,” Bitfinex wrote to CoinDesk.  Most altcoins were recently higher on Friday, with Internet Computer's ICP leading the charts, up 7% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down 0.4% over the same period.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Binance Volume Surges After Zero Trading Fee Policy Goes Live  Trading volume spiked higher at Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, after its worldwide, zero trading fee policy went live on Friday morning. The zero trading fees for 13 crypto pairs began Friday at 14:00 UTC (10 a.m. ET). The move caused an explosion in trading at the exchange, with bitcoin/tether (USDT) spot volume surging to 320,000 coins within hours. The exchange hasn’t seen volume that high for even a full day since March 2020.  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao attributed the surge to people trying to gain VIP tiers via high trading volumes. “We will exclude BTC trading from VIP calculations,” he tweeted. “Remove all incentives to wash trade. Announcement with details coming shortly.” A wash tradeoccurs when an investor buys and sells an asset for the purpose of artificially inflating the price. Read more here.

42421144,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZWQP,1657311312,"Bitcoin Will Make a Comeback, Rockefeller International Chairman Says","Bitcoin (BTC) is fundamentally a good idea that has been spoiled by too much cheap money and speculative interest, according to Rockefeller International Managing Director and Chairman Ruchir Sharma.  Sharma, a former emerging markets investor at banking giant Morgan Stanley (MS) as well as a New York Times bestselling author, said bitcoin could make a comeback in similar fashion to that of e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN), which plunged about 90% in the early-2000s dot-com collapse, but subsequently rose more than 300 times in value over the next 20-plus years.  First, however, “we need the excesses to get weeded out,” Sharma said about bitcoin on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program. “And then we can see the emergence once again of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, as a steadier asset.”  Read more: Three Arrows Capital Liquidation Ordered in British Virgin Islands  Bitcoin, he said, for now remains “caught up in this speculative mania,” whose global collapse still isn’t complete. He returned to the Amazon example, noting it took some time for that company to recover. Indeed, it was several years until the stock of the online retailer caught up to and surpassed its bubbly 1999 level.  For bitcoin and other digital assets, Sharma thinks the next six months could see further drops, at least in part thanks to a continued decline in U.S. stocks. He noted typical bear markets last about a year and stocks fall 35%. This current bear is less than a year old and the S&P 500 has fallen by just 20%.  “I’m not willing to call the [market] bottom as of yet on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies,” he said. “The U.S. bear market regime, which is the driver of risk appetite around the world, is still very much in play.”  Something different?  Sharma supports the idea of a currency regime that does not center on the U.S. dollar. While there hasn’t been a currency able to take the greenback’s place, bitcoin could be the answer, he suggested.  “The dependence on the U.S. dollar in general cannot continue … There is a need for having another currency out there with some transactional need, which is a bit more stable in value … Three to five years from now, hopefully [bitcoin] will emerge as a more stable asset.”  Read more: Digital Dollar Would Secure Greenback as Global Reserve Currency, Lawmaker Argues  “The window of opportunity is open,” Sharma added, but the clearing of speculative excess needs to happen first.  Bullish on India  Sharma is bullish on crypto in India, saying the government is limited in how much it can control digital assets.  From an economic standpoint, the country’s use of bitcoin and other digital cryptocurrencies to issue payments via direct digital transfers is helping everyday residents.

42395261,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXpV8,1657311006,"Celsius Pivots Toward Paying Off Aave, Compound Debt, With $950M Collateral as Prize","Celsius, the liquidity-strapped crypto lender that this week paid down $223 million of loans on the blockchain protocol Maker to free up $450 million in collateral, now might be trying a similar strategy with two other big decentralized-finance (DeFi) platforms – Aave and Compound.  Data on DeFi data dashboard Zapper shows that a crypto wallet linked to Celsius by blockchain intelligence firm Nansen reduced its outstanding debt to Aave and Compound to $235 million from $258 million on Friday.  Should Celsius fully pay off the loans, the crypto lender will theoretically be able to reclaim about $950 million in assets that are pledged against the debt and are locked up as of now on the DeFi protocols.  These moves look like part of the firm’s strategy to restructure its debt to DeFi protocols and reclaim the valuable collateral that is locked up for now to cover the alleged hole on the firm’s balance sheet.  The bigger picture is that keen observers with access to blockchain-data explorers are getting a front-row seat to watch a troubled crypto firm as it works to solve a liquidity crunch in the era of decentralized finance.  ""DeFi debt repayment could provide necessary liquidity to maximize recoverable value in a potential transaction,"" John Freyermuth, research analyst at Enigma Securities, told CoinDesk.  How Celsius pays off its debt  Celsius, helmed by CEO Alex Mashinsky, is reportedly working with restructuring experts from advisory firm Alvarez & Marshal and hired banking giant Citigroup (C) for advice on financing options. The company said June 30 that it was exploring options to “preserve and protect assets” – such steps might include pursuing strategic transactions and restructuring liabilities.  One day after that announcement, Celsius started to reduce its debt to DeFi protocols, blockchain data shows.  These types of automated loans are generally overcollateralized, meaning that the borrower pledges more assets in value than the loan it can take out. To prioritize repaying these DeFi loans is net positive for Celsius, because the firm can reclaim the valuable collateral by spending a fraction of collateral’s value.  First, Celsius started to pay back its debt to DeFi protocol Maker, which amounted to $223 million.  In less than a week, the crypto lender fully paid off its loan and got a hold on the debt’s collateral worth $450 million, CoinDesk reported Thursday, in the form of wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), a bitcoin derivative product on the Ethereum blockchain.  Hours later, the firm transferred $500 million in WBTC to the crypto exchange FTX, possibly with the intention to sell.  And now, Celsius appears to be getting more active on Aave and Compound, where the payoff might be even bigger.  What does it mean for crypto prices?  At press time, the Celsius wallet owed $150 million to Aave in Circle’s USDC stablecoin and another $85 million to Compound in Maker platform’s DAI stablecoin, according to data on Zapper.  The collateral Celsius pledged against the Aave and Compound loans was worth about $633 million and $316 million, respectively, in the form of various cryptocurrencies or derivatives such as WBTC, ETH, LINK, SNX, UNI and COMP.  Blockchain data tracer Etherscan shows Celsius transferred $16 million in Maker’s DAI stablecoin and a transaction of $3 million in Circle’s USDC stablecoin to Aave in the early hours of Friday.  Transaction history on Zapper also shows that Celsius converted yield-earning token derivatives issued by the Aave protocol of ETH, LINK, BAT and SNX back to regular tokens, amounting to $50 million at current prices.  FundStrat analyst Walter Teng told CoinDesk earlier this week that the reclaimed collateral can later be sold on exchanges or via over-the-counter deals to meet creditor demands and customer withdrawals. Any dumping by Celsius might put pressure on prices for crypto assets.  At press time, smaller altcoins among Celsius' holdings such as BAT, COMP and SNX were down down 5%, 3.2% and 7.6%, while the rest of the cryptocurrency market trades flat.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SNX,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SNX,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/08/celsius-pivots-toward-paying-off-aave-compound-debt-with-950m-collateral-as-prize,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a9e8aea8f12058c5c0b826a3f617ed6de402a67-1641x1231.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

From the daily chart, SRM crypto prices may retest $1 in a bullish continuation formation. Past Performance of Serum After surging to as high as $13.5 in September 2021, Serum prices sank 94 percent to $0.72 in June 2022. Technically, Serum bears are still in charge, but there could be hope for bulls if prices clear $1.

Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Observes Sharp Rise To Positive Values As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, after many months of negative values, the Coinbase premium gap is now above zero. The &apos;Coinbase premium gap&apos; is an indicator that measures the difference between the Bitcoin price on Coinbase Pro (USD pair) and the value on Binance (USDT pair). Since Coinbase is popularly used by US investors (especially institutionals), while Binance is used more in other parts of the world, the difference in BTC prices between the exchanges can suggest where the buying/sell pressure could be coming from. When the value of the premium gap is greater than zero, it means the value of the crypto listed on Coinbase is currently more than on Binance.

Zero trading fees worldwide for 13 crypto pairs at Binance – the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume – began Friday at 14:00 UTC (10 a.m. ET). The move caused an explosion in trading at the exchange, with bitcoin/tether (USDT) spot volume surging to 320,000 coins within hours. The exchange hasn’t seen volume that high for even a full day since March 2020.  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao attributed the surge to people trying to gain VIP tiers via high trading volumes. “We will exclude BTC trading from VIP calculations,” he tweeted. “Remove all incentives to wash trade. Announcement with details coming shortly.” A wash tradeoccurs when an investor buys and sells an asset for the purpose of artificially inflating the price.  The exchange made the zero-fee announcement on Wednesday, with the plan becoming effective Friday on Binance’s fifth anniversary.  “With the onset of the crypto bear market, exchanges like Binance have been seeking ways of attracting and retaining users on their platforms to ensure their slice of the depleted pie remains healthy,” CoinDesk reported at the time.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Jimmy He,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/08/binance-volume-surges-after-zero-trading-fee-policy-goes-live,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/adf8cf70ba879755f3c6172809b1c446f2621c4d-5149x3862.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421512,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoWFx,1657303303,Decentralization's Failed Promise in Iran,"In the middle of a volatile cryptocurrency market, you might not care that Iranians have greater financial problems than citizens of the privileged world. For years, there have been considerable bans on Iranian nationals' activity – from access prohibition to the blocking of users and assets – on various crypto platforms.  Mahzad Elyassi is a journalist, writer and anthropologist from Iran.  Crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, LocalBitcoins and the Blockchain.com website have restricted access to their platforms for all Iranian users. Crypto exchange platform Bittrex froze millions of dollars of Iranian users' crypto funds from 2017 to 2019 without any prior warning or explanation.  In a similar move, NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace OpenSea removed Iranians from its platform overnight in March 2022. There is no direct financial exchange on OpenSea, and yet not only have the NFT assets of Iranian artists and creators vanished, but also Iranian art buyers have lost their property without any warning.  Meysam is one of the creators who has lost his NFTs on this platform:  One day, I realized all the meta data of my accounts on OpenSea is gone. The transactions were still available on blockchain but the data for the buyers also disappeared. I had another account that had no transaction but the NFTs were gone on that account too. It was a shocking experience for me and the others. Iranian NFT community is so active and successful but even the collectors are now cautious about buying NFT from Iranian artists  Against the ethos of decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized exchanges such as ShapeShift and IDEX have banned Iranians from their platforms. The Uniswap front end has excluded Iran from the website, but the protocol itself – based on smart contracts hosted on the Ethereum blockchain – is still accessible to Iranians. The Uniswap ban was apparently discovered via a change on a code posted on GitHub, not by an official announcement on the website.  This is not just about crypto exchanges or NFT platforms. ConsenSys, the Ethereum software powerhouse, suspended the enrollment of 50 Iranian students in the middle of its online course, and Gitcoin, a crowdfunding platform, discontinued a campaign funded by grants aimed at helping Farsi-speaking women students (including women from Afghanistan) learn Ethereum coding.  This is what Salman Sadeghi, one of the Iranian students who received the scholarship from ConsenSys, wrote about the incident:  It seems so disappointing to me, not because some young talented students would not be able to learn how to be the new world developers, you know that there are always alternative solutions, but because it with itself unfolds the underlying truth of our current transition to the so-called decentralized world, a world which surprisingly ConsenSys itself is a designer of     Iranians overseas  Iranian residents of Europe and the U.S. haven’t been exempt from such policies. Binance customer service allegedly mentioned that Iranians “by blood” were banned from the platform regardless of their place of residence. This could be a mere language mistake by a non-English-speaking employee, and yet no formal apology or explanation ever followed this shocking statement.  U.S. regulators' requirements come from the sanctions imposed by the U.S. government following its withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (commonly known as the “Iran deal”), which is supposed to target the assets and activities of Iran’s government as part of the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s sanctioned nations.  In practice, however, the restrictions have barely affected the regime’s agenda. Western countries have been insensitive to the fact that the closed crypto accounts belong to real human beings with hopes and dreams. It is easy to dehumanize people who are under sanctions, but some lives have been seriously affected by the bans.  Money lost  “It's more than four months and my Bittrex enhanced account is disabled. They don't give me the right answer. I got a loan from the bank and invest in coins in Bittrex but they don't give back my money. I am losing my money and my house because of Bittrex,” said a 2018 tweet with the hashtag #bittrex_disabled_accounts from a user desperately trying to voice his loss.  There are similar kinds of messages on different forums, and it is unclear what has happened to the cryptocurrencies involved. But Reza Lotfian, a user I interviewed for this article, said he got his money back from Bittrex with a huge loss due to the timing of withdrawal.  Additionally, the scams have been growing in Iran’s crypto market thanks to the black market revolving around third parties claiming to be experts in bypassing sanctions by creating fake IDs. Surely, there would be those who are rightfully targeted by sanctions among the users, but indiscriminately targeting a country's whole population is comparable to bombing a wedding to kill a couple of terrorists lurking among the attendants.  They are doomed to wrestle with restrictive internet filtering policies and geo-blockades of blind obedience to international sanctions  I am working in Tehran in a shared space consisting of more than 600 startups, mostly staffed by a younger generation of educated people who are trying to think and work globally. Nevertheless, they are doomed to wrestle simultaneously with the restrictive internet-filtering policies imposed by their government and geo-blockades of blind obedience to international sanctions.  These talented people have been excluded from the news headlines and removed from international consideration. We are simply trapped in the political conflicts of governments. Banning all the users of a country not only blocks accounts but also wipes out a nation, culture and engagement – in a nutshell, freedom of expression.  The 1996 manifesto “A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace"" written by John Perry Barlow now sounds more like a fantastical utopia than ever before. We can repeat that the five pillars of blockchain tech are open, public, borderless, neutral and censorship-resistant, but while the exchange platforms are still abiding by fiat institutes’ monetary rules, it is dishonest to call bitcoin decentralized money for exchange.  Far from utopia  We are far away from the distributed ledger technology utopia once portrayed by enthusiastic users of blockchain forums. There is no genuine Bitcoin “community” as long as a part of the community shrugs off another part. It is hypocritical to pretend to function as an open-community decentralized platform while using the trend as an attraction, and then discarding the idea after reaching a considerable capital virtue that is required to be “regulated.”  Since we have accepted the surveillance of governments out of terrorism fears (which are usually created by those very governments), no wonder the dominance will grow increasingly stringent even for U.S. citizens and others dwelling in the “free” world.  Now that people from Iran, Venezuela and Cuba are barred from the community, tomorrow the community might shrink to even fewer “acceptable” users, cutting off crypto's nose to spite its face.  Banning all the users of a country wipes out a nation, culture, engagement, and in a nutshell, freedom of expression  Iran’s economy is imploding under unprecedented sanctions. Inflation rates are hammering the middle class, which represent the main defenders of values such as freedom and democracy. But some people are concerned about peace and freedom, no matter from which country or nation citizens come. These people need to recognize one another and establish a dialogue.  As activists, we know that dehumanization begets aggression, discrimination and violence. The case of GitHub proves that geo-bans shouldn't be taken for granted – whereas defending the rights of all users will result in the free flow of information. Sanctions need more-efficient bureaucratic procedures, but the easier way, unfortunately, is to eliminate all people of a country rather than incur the cost.  As internet activists and believers in decentralized core principles, we should emphasize finding a solution to the prior presumption of innocence, not vice versa. We should react and protest against the irresponsible behavior of regulators who are supposed to provide services for cryptocurrencies.

42421504,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoW9l,1657301005,"Celsius Looks Sloppy in New Lawsuit, but So Does the DeFi Legend Suing It","Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we angle to offer 18% APR on crypto deposits.  A lawsuit filed Thursday in New York State’s Supreme Court claims an asset manager that deployed customer funds for troubled crypto-lending platform Celsius Network has not been paid for its services. The suit contains extremely troubling (if unsurprising) allegations about trading and risk management practices at Celsius as the firm worked to generate the huge returns it promised depositors.  The lawsuit, alongside a recent research report, also cast new light on a pseudonymous Twitter account, @0x­_b1, that became highly influential with the 2020 rise of decentralized finance, or DeFi, tools. The account was regarded as a “whale,” or large crypto holder, but was not widely known to, in fact, be managing assets for Celsius. As the suit was filed, the account “doxed” itself as a group including a DeFi trader and staking strategist named Jason Stone.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the top stories in crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Stone was one of the founders of KeyFi, a firm that agreed in August 2020 to deploy customer funds to DeFi and staking protocols on behalf of Celsius. This in and of itself was one of the overlooked red flags at Celsius, which premised its initial yield strategy on institutional lending but soon began to chase riskier returns through DeFi. That led in at least one instance to multimillion-dollar hacking losses – and it’s increasingly unclear that it generated any real revenue.  In the filing, KeyFi claims it has not been paid money owed from profits generated from its trading activities on Celsius’s behalf. According to the lawsuit, KeyFi was promised “7.5% of ‘Net Profits’ for all staking activity and 20% of Net Profits for DeFi activity.” Crucially, the agreement purportedly specified “profits” as denominated in U.S. dollars.  The suit reinforces some things we already strongly suspected about Celsius’s operation. Most notably, it presents examples of sloppy internal controls and serious disregard for risk to Celsius customer funds. The suit claims, for instance, that in one case “Celsius improperly [accounted] for certain payments owed to customers, resulting in a $200 million liability the company did not even understand how or why it owed.”  Even more dramatically, KeyFi alleges Celsius misled it about hedging activities that shaped trading strategies. KeyFi claims Celsius said it had hedges in place against the risk that the U.S. dollar price of crypto assets owed to customers would rise, but did not in fact have such hedges in place. As described by KeyFi, this meant trading activities that generated profits in dollar terms but involved trading away or locking up crypto assets could still wind up underwater when depositors decided they wanted their ETH or BTC back.  Stranger still, KeyFi claims Celsius denominated profits in dollars under the trading agreement, while Celsius’s obligations to customers were denominated in tokens. That kind of asset/liability mismatch can present extreme and unpredictable risk in finance, and it appears to be the root of the current dispute. According to the KeyFi suit, Celsius cited token-denominated rather than U.S. dollar metrics to claim KeyFi didn’t actually generate any returns that would merit promised royalty payments. Celsius has not yet publicly responded to the suit.  What the suit leaves out  It’s vital to keep in mind that allegations made in a lawsuit like this are just that – allegations, unvetted by anyone other than the plaintiff’s legal team and framed to look good for the plaintiff. The KeyFi suit, as it happens, arrived on the heels of a report from analytics firm Arkham Intelligence that seems to challenge several elements of KeyFi’s account.  Most notably, the Arkham report undermines the suit’s claim that “KeyFi’s investment strategies were extremely profitable.” Instead, according to Arkham’s analysis, dollar returns on KeyFi’s strategies relied entirely on rising values of the underlying assets. In fact, Arkham concludes Celsius would have generated better returns simply by holding customer deposits.  “Had Celsius held these assets instead of sending them to 0x_b1,” Arkham concludes, “their value would have been $1.52 billion – close to $400 million more than what 0x_b1 appears to have returned.”  If true, that’s a bombshell in itself. 0x_b1 has for years now been something of a standard bearer for DeFi as a whole. If the group’s returns were illusory, it could cast doubt on at least some aspects of the entire DeFi project.  And as even KeyFi describes in its own suit, the circumstances are extremely strange. In a traditional finance setting it would be inconceivable for a trading desk to operate merely on assurances that someone, somewhere, was tracking and appropriately hedging its activities. Hedging is so granularly intertwined with trading that such separation makes little sense on its face, and agreeing to such an arrangement does not paint KeyFi in a particularly professional or sophisticated light.  Even leaving that aside, though, Arkham found that KeyFi/0x_b1’s returns began to falter when markets turned against the team. 0x_b1 was repeatedly liquidated on margin longs as the price of ether (ETH) and other assets dropped in early 2021. Arkham claims $61 million of “what appears to be Celsius money” was lost in liquidations against 0xB1.  That strongly suggests an alternate narrative about Celsius and the 0xb1/KeyFi's breakup. Via the lawsuit, KeyFi claims it terminated its relationship with Celsius in March 2021 after discovering and contesting perceived mismanagement. But given that the KeyFi traders’ strategies appeared to fail in the then-slumping market, it wouldn’t be surprising if the team’s real motivations were a bit less altruistic, and a bit more about protecting their own reputation as DeFi deities.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | ARKM,David Z.

The digital asset which had been struggling to hold the $20,000 had finally broken out of this funk and was able to make a rally to the mid $22,000s. This rally had naturally led to liquidations in the market and as time goes on, these liquidations ramped up with the volatility that has followed this price recovery. More Than 65,000 Traders Rekt As of Friday morning, data from Coinglass shows that more than 65,000 traders have been liquidated over the last 24 hours. The liquidations had surged following the quick recovery of bitcoin above $20,000 and by the end of the day, it had added over $2,000 to its value. Traders were quickly caught off guard and millions of dollars in short positions were liquidated. Related Reading | Bitcoin Funding Rates Are Climbing As Price Continues To Struggle In total, there have been more than $280 million in liquidations over the last day and they continue to grow. The majority has come out to be shorts with $214.74 million in the last day. However, long traders have not been spared the onslaught with $67.35 million in the same time period. The reason for the long liquidations is that the digital asset had peaked in the mid-$22,000s and has lost about $1,000 since then.

42395246,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXpJK,1657297091,"Three Arrows Wanted a $100M NFT Collection. Instead, It’s Worth Less Than $5M","At the height of last summer’s non-fungible token (NFT) mania, Three Arrows Capital – then a behemoth managing tens of billions of dollars – partnered with pseudonymous non-fungible token collector Vincent Van Dough to launch Starry Night Capital, an NFT fund that aimed to raise $100 million.  But in the crypto-markets wreckage of 2022 that has Three Arrows looking down the barrel of a court-ordered liquidation, the Starry Night fund is worth a fraction of what it aimed for and its only institutional investor has declared a total write-off of its investment.  While Three Arrows made an effort to obscure its relationship with its over-the counter trading desk TPS Capital via a complex paper trail, the relationship between Three Arrows and Starry Night has never been much of a secret.  According to estimates prepared by DappRadar using on-chain data, Starry Night’s wallet has an estimated net worth of $4.2 million. CoinMetrics researcher Kyle Waters said the fund spent $21 million amassing this portfolio, with numerous blockbuster purchases sometimes in the millions of dollars. At one time, Waters later tweeted, it amounted for 10% of NFT marketplace SuperRare’s volume.  Starry Night’s Vincent Van Dough didn't respond to a request for comment.  Now, the fund has been moved from its prior home on SuperRare to a new wallet, tweeted one prominent NFT collector, leading to speculation that a fire sale might be in the works.  Total write-off  Amid the bull market hype of last summer’s NFT rush, Three Arrows and Starry Night got KR1, a U.K.-based listed digital assets fund, to invest $5 million into the fund.  According to a June 30 earnings release from KR1, its $5 million subscription into Starry Night Capital was done via a purchase of ""Class Starry Night Shares"" in British Virgin Islands-registered Three Arrows Fund Ltd. A search of corporate registries in Singapore, BVI and the Cayman Islands showed no results for an entity named Starry Night.  In a recent earnings statement, KR1 said it had impaired the value of these Starry Night Shares by 100%, writing off its value entirely from its books. A spokesperson for KR1 declined to comment further. The company’s stock, listed on the Aquis exchange, has declined by nearly 80% on the year.  Pressure on the NFT market  As bankruptcy proceedings begin in BVI and Starry Night’s value is assessed, the question is for how much these NFTs can be sold.  The DappRadar valuation of the Starry Night portfolio at $4.2 million notwithstanding, even that diminished level might not be reliable – with volatile cryptocurrency markets still recovering from their recent crash.  Data from NonFungible shows that in the last three months, the secondary sales market for NFTs has been obliterated compared with when Starry Night was amassing its collection last year.  On Aug. 12, the NFT market had peaked with 746,000 weekly primary NFT sales, according to NonFungible, and approximately 506,000 secondary sales.  But those were bull market times. Fast forward to now, and the primary and secondary markets have flipped in prominence. The secondary market is down to around 134,000 weekly sales while the primary market has 60,000. That suggests a grand unloading.  The average value of an NFT is down 68% in the last three months to $628, according to NonFungible’s data tracker. To underscore the data point, former Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey’s $2.9 million first tweet is now worth just $280.

And she suggests an answer: “Strong regulatory guardrails will help enable investors and developers to build a resilient digital native financial infrastructure.”  The vice chairwoman contends that the shortcomings of crypto are basically the same as traditional finance, and the sector needs to meet the same safety standards before it gets large enough to become a threat to the rest of the financial system.  “We have seen crypto trading platforms and crypto lending firms not only engage in activities similar to those in traditional finance without comparable regulatory compliance, but also combine activities that are required to be separated in traditional financial markets,” she said at the Bank of England event. “For example, some platforms combine market infrastructure and client facilitation with risk-taking businesses like asset creation, proprietary trading, venture capital and lending.”  TerraUSD’s meltdown has drawn the attention of the Fed and other regulators, and Brainard equated it with other financial runs throughout history.  “New technology and financial engineering cannot by themselves convert risky assets into safe ones,” she said. Brainard argued that stresses throughout the industry have revealed that crypto platforms suffer from classic vulnerabilities and contagions, “illustrated by the freeze on withdrawals at some crypto lending platforms and exchanges and the bankruptcy of a prominent crypto hedge fund.” Last week, hedge fund Three Arrows Capital filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York federal court.  She suggested that all this reinforces the idea that a central bank digital currency from the U.S. “may be an advantage for future financial stability.” Such a government token could have profound implications for the private stablecoin market.  The Senate is soon expected to confirm Michael Barr, President Joe Biden’s pick to be the next Fed vice chairman for supervision, who will lead the central bank’s regulatory and financial-supervision efforts, including how the U.S. will oversee stablecoins. Barr is widely seen as a consumer advocate who will promote tough regulation. He served for a time on the advisory board of crypto firm Ripple, and so he is familiar with the industry.

42421513,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoWGz,1657293779,Need a Use Case for Decentralization? Start With Energy,"If the crypto industry cares about mainstream adoption – rather than just pumping its bags – it will need to demonstrate socially useful applications for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology that resonate with the wider population.  Let’s face it: The recent collapse of major crypto lending institutions and the sell-off in bitcoin, ether and other tokens have confirmed that crypto’s main value proposition so far has been the opportunity to speculate on “number-go-up” expectations.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  As a model for the market structure of the future, decentralized finance (DeFi) contains the promise of a more equitable financial system. But the high yields it offered were driven by demand for crypto borrowing and lending, which in turn depended on there being arbitrage opportunities in the underlying token markets. As expectations for rapid returns in cryptocurrencies wane, activity in those markets will drop, which will lead the arbitrageurs to retreat and “yield farming” to cool off.  The challenge now is to find real-world use cases that produce lasting, meaningful returns upon which DeFi yields can be sustained.  Our starting point should be to identify non-financial markets whose centralized structure is doing clear harm. Note: Decentralizing those markets won’t necessarily generate use cases for cryptocurrencies or blockchains, but the arguments for them should be stronger in these situations.  In my mind, there is one industry above all where centralization is a massive problem, one where the costs to society are self-evident and rising: energy.  Energy’s centralization costs  Consider the effect of recent disruptions in oil and natural gas markets.  The world is so dependent on oil that shifts in its supply, and the resultant swings in prices, can determine the health of the global economy. And it's all built around a highly centralized industry, with most of the world’s proven crude reserves located in a few, authoritarian states, creating dependencies, bottlenecks and profound political vulnerabilities.  In late February, one of those states, Russia, invaded Ukraine. It almost immediately incurred Western sanctions on its exports, which sent prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil skyrocketing by 40% to almost $120 a barrel. That sent the cost of gasoline and other oil derivatives soaring, which when added to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes accelerated the world’s march into a recession. One measure of that harsh whipsaw effect is a recent reversal in those same crude prices, which this week briefly dipped below $100, as analysts started to predict a plunge in demand.  Similarly, the dependence of Germany and other European countries’ on natural gas from Russia has sent prices for natural gas, as well as its shippable alternative, liquid natural gas, up by 700% since last year. Just as bad, gas shortages have threatened the viability of much of the Continent’s electricity.  Besides the war in Ukraine, other vulnerabilities to the energy industry’s centralized bottlenecks abound.  Remember last year’s Colonial Pipeline shutdown? A pipeline supplying 60 million people gave hackers huge leverage with which to extort the company into paying their ransom. It offered the physical equivalent of a “single attack vector,” enabling a classic “man in the middle” attack.  Or consider how Hurricane Maria, after wiping out just a few of the high-voltage transmission lines that transport electricity from Puerto Rico’s dirty, fuel oil-dependent generation plants, left 90% of the potentially renewables-rich island without power for months in 2017.  Read more: Michael Casey - LTCM and Other History Lessons for Crypto  Vulnerability to outside events such as these – which electricity system designers describe as a lack of “redundancy” – is just as big a reason to advocate for renewable energy as the climate crisis.  We desperately need to decentralize our energy model. Renewables such as solar, geothermal and wind are the answer because they are locally sourced and can function at wide ranges of scale – from single-home solar arrays to massive wind farms.  Crypto’s role  Decentralizing the energy system doesn’t necessarily translate into an accompanying need for a decentralized monetary system or blockchain-based transaction and data recording system. But crypto is a natural fit for such systems, and over the years, people have worked out a variety of ways in which it can be useful.  First, if we are going to spread solar, geothermal and wind across a wide swath of the world, we face the problem that many of those places are without access to traditional sources of finance to fund the installation.  One solution is to invite bitcoin miners to locate in such areas and have them underwrite the project development. Companies such as Griid are at the forefront of building relationships with developers of renewable energy projects and miners. A Texas project spearheaded by Block, Tesla and Blockstream is looking to show that mining and solar can be combined at scale.  Meanwhile, smart chips like those that Australia-based Sunified, can be embedded into solar panels to generate provable data that when recorded in a blockchain environment can be converted into tradeable digital assets. The hope is these kinds of DeFi assets can be used by institutional investors looking to satisfy their environmental, social and governance (ESG) mandates, fostering liquid markets in carbon-neutral assets that can help to unlock the trillions of dollars in investment needed to combat climate change.  There are still millions of people who believe crypto can be a force for positive change.

42394519,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwAV5l,1657293052,"The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, Explained","If you’re a crypto investor, chances are you might have stumbled across the Crypto Fear and Greed Index on social media or in the news. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a metric designed to gauge the market sentiment of cryptocurrency at any given time.  It is important to understand the structure of the index, what it captures and what it tells you about the market so you can decide whether it’s an indicator you should pay attention to for your investment decisions.  See Also: How to Avoid Crypto Bear Market Mistakes and Be Ready for the Next Bull Run  What is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index?  The index generates a single number, between 1 and 100, with 1 indicating that the crypto market is in a state of extreme fear (meaning people are selling,) while on the other end of the spectrum, 100 indicates that the market is undergoing an extreme level of greed (meaning people are buying).  A general rule of thumb is that when the index value is at 1, this generally correlates to a buying opportunity. This is because the number 1 indicates “extreme fear” in the market, meaning people are afraid of buying at this time, and the price may be deflated as people stay away or sell over fears the crypto is going to lose value. As billionaire American investment guru Warren Buffett once said, “buy when there’s blood in the streets.”  Read more: 4 Tips to Maximize Your Crypto Investment  On the other hand, if the index is showing 100 it would be seen as “extreme greed” and would generally be interpreted as a sell signal. Think of this as a rush of people trying to get into a hot market at any price, as they want to get into a meteoric rise as investors saw with meme stocks in 2021. When prices rise quickly, there’s a chance prices will sharply reverse and fall just as fast.  To make this simple: When the Fear and Greed Index value is low, this may signal that the crypto price will increase, and when the index value is high, this could indicate the crypto price will soon move lower.  How the Fear and Greed Index is calculated  So how do they arrive at the final number? There are multiple factors that influence the ultimate output.  Volatility: The index compares volatility and max drawdowns (a drawdown is a decline in value) against the 30-day and 90-day average volatility and drawdown numbers. Higher volatility is considered fearful and increases the final output. Volatility represents 25% of the index value.  Momentum/volume: The index measures the current momentum and volume of the bitcoin market. Again, against the 30-day and 90-day averages. High volume and momentum are seen as negative metrics and increase the final index output. Momentum/volume represents 25% of the index value.  Social Media: The index tracts mentions and hashtags for bitcoin, and compares them to historical averages. Higher mentions and hashtags are interpreted as increased market involvement and lead to an increase in the final index output. Social media represents 15% of the index value.  Surveys: The index conducts large, market-wide surveys on a weekly basis. Usually, there are 2,000-3,000 participants in each survey. More enthusiastic survey results drive the index higher, pointing to market greed prevailing. Surveys represent 15% of the index value.  Dominance: The index measures bitcoin dominance in the overall market. The higher the bitcoin dominance, the more fearful the market – as interpreted by the index. As alternative coins gain market share, the market is acting courageously and not fearfully. The lower the bitcoin dominance, the greedier the market is becoming. Dominance represents 10% of the index value.  Trends: The index includes Google trend numbers in the final value. The higher the search interest of cryptocurrency becomes; the higher amount of greed is seen in the market. Trends represent 10% of the index value.  Is the Fear and Greed Index reliable?  The question becomes: Does the fear and greed index provide insight into the future price of cryptocurrency? LookIntoBitcoin.com has charted the Crypto Fear and Greed Index against the bitcoin price, going back to 2018.  The price and index value seem to be quite correlated – albeit over a relatively short period of time. A higher bitcoin price seems to have led to a higher Fear and Greed index value.  There are a few things to consider when using the Fear and Greed Index as a trading indicator. Ask yourself a few important questions:  Am I a trader or a long-term investor? If you are a trader and constantly moving in and out of crypto positions, you might gain insight from following the index value. If you are a long-term investor, actively trading might result in you missing major rallies and ultimately decreasing your total return.  Have I thought about my tax strategy regarding cryptocurrency? If you’re actively trading, either day trading or swing trading crypto based on technical indicators such as the Fear and Greed Index, you’re more prone to short-term capital gains tax (the same as income tax) on your gains. It is crucially important to factor this into your trading decisions.  Am I a fundamental or technical trader? The Fear and Greed Index is a technical indicator. It does not consider any fundamental factors of cryptocurrency in its final output. If you are investing in cryptocurrency based on a macroeconomic outlook, for example, it’s easy to argue that the Fear and Greed Index is entirely irrelevant to your investment thesis.

Three Arrows Capital, which boasted billions of dollars in assets under management earlier this year, has imploded thanks to a combination of plummeting crypto prices and poor risk management, with many crypto lending businesses becoming exposed.  Smith pointed out that Three Arrows has borrowed and repaid over $700 million worth of cryptocurrency in the four years that the firm has been a counterparty of Blockchain.com. Smith also emphasized that Blockchain.com “remains liquid, solvent and our customers will not be impacted,” in the letter dated June 24.  About a week ago, Blockchain.com and derivatives exchange Deribit were reported to be among the creditors that pushed for the liquidation of Three Arrows, also known as 3AC. In a Bloomberg News report, Smith said 3AC had “defrauded the crypto industry,” adding that this company intended “to hold them accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”  A person familiar with Blockchain.com’s finances told CoinDesk the company was in good shape to weather the losses.  “We are not getting the sense there is any kind of stress on the organization,” the person said.

42395264,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXpW7,1657287883,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin’s Bear Cross Is Bullish and a Big June Jobs Beat,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price Point: BTC is trading up on the day as short liquidations get washed out, triggering buy orders. Traditional markets react to the news of the death o former Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  Market Moves: Omkar Godble looks atthe bearish but historically contrarian ""bear cross"" indicator, which suggests an end to the market decline and a bullish revival ahead.  JUST IN: The U.S. jobs report for June showed a gain of 372,000 in nonfarm payrolls, exceeding economists’ estimates for a 275,000 increase. The report might suggest that the Federal Reserve will have little choice but to raise the benchmark U.S. interest rate by an 0.75 percentage point at a meeting later this month to keep the economy from getting too hot. Bitcoin was trading about 1% lower in the minutes after the release of the report. (Check CoinDesk for updates.)  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) traded above $21,500 for the first time in a week. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was up 4.5% on the day after dipping to a low of $19,300 earlier this week.  U.S. stock futures slid and European equities were lower as the news broke that Abe, Japan’s former longest serving prime minister known for his ""Abenomics"" policy, was shot while making a campaign speech in Nara, Japan.  Ether (ETH) was up 2.5% to about $1,211. ETH started the week off at lows of about $1,000 and has climbed since then.  The correlation between cryptocurrencies and other risky assets continues to strengthen as the global macro environment appears to be driving prices.  Fabio Ackeret, a sales trader at Crypto Finance AG, said he doesn't see a breakout in the crypto market anytime soon.  “To see crypto breaking out on the upside, the dust of all recent events needs to settle (UST, Celsius, 3AC),” Ackeret wrote in a note on Friday, referring to the collapse in the price of Terra's UST stablecoin and the woes at crypto lender Celsius Network and hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.  Meanwhile, as bitcoin's price goes up, the shares of publicly traded crypto miners rose 9.6% between Wednesday and Thursday, according to data from CoinDesk.  In other news, Celsius deposited $500 million in wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), a bitcoin derivative product of the Ethereum blockchain, to crypto exchange FTX just hours after Celsius repaid its debt to the decentralized lending protocol Maker and reclaimed $450 million of collateral in WBTC.  Moon Tech Spain, the Spanish subsidiary of trading platform Binance, has been granted registration as a virtual asset services provider by Spain's central bank.  In Latin America, Bitso, announced on Thursday it has launched a cryptocurrency remittance service in Colombia. The service – which will allow individuals and businesses to send and receive digital dollars – is the first crypto remittance product in Colombia to date, according to Bitso.  Remittances totaling $8.56 billion were sent to Colombia from abroad in 2021, an all-time record, El Tiempo newspaper reported.  Compass Mining has laid off 15% of its employees and cut executive compensation to ride out the crypto downturn. The bitcoin mining company said it's reassessing its priorities after growing too quickly.     Market moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin 'Bear Cross' Raises Outlook for Bull Revival  Yes, you read the title right. An impending bearish crossover, a technical pattern theoretically suggesting continued weakness in the bitcoin price, could be a trap for sellers and portend a bullish revival.  A three-day-candlestick chart shows the simple moving average (SMA) of the past 100 candlesticks is on the verge of crossing below the 200-candle SMA, confirming the first bearish crossover of the two averages since December 2018.  Historically, the crossover has marked an end of bear markets and paved the way for notable bull runs.  The averages crossed bearishly in December 2018, trapping sellers on the wrong side of the market. Bitcoin hit a bottom of about $3,200 and spent the following three months building a base for a rally. The cryptocurrency hit a high of $13,800 by the end of June 2019.  The bear cross of February 2015 coincided with peak selling, and bitcoin began a multiyear bull run seven months later. The first bear cross, dated June 2012, also trapped sellers on the wrong side of the market.  Crossovers between longer duration moving averages are known to be contrary indicators because they are based on past data and tend to lag prices. The market is often battered, oversold and overdue for a reversal higher by the time the crossover is confirmed.  Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. That said, history could repeat itself because the Fed's hawkishness, or anti-stimulus stance, appears to have peaked and traders are now pricing interest rate cuts for 2023.

42421518,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoWJ3,1657287000,Unpacking the Latest Bitcoin ETF Rejections,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected more spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund applications. It’s worth unpacking the agency’s reasoning, even as new applications are filed.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  One step closer?  The narrative  Two bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications were denied last week. The big question for me is whether we’re learning anything new from these rejections. At this point, I’m not sure – a lot of these rejections really read the same.  Why it matters  Even if the bitcoin ETF rejections are all similar, it’s always worth digging in and examining the Securities and Exchange Commission’s reasoning, and what we can learn from it.  Breaking it down  To no one’s surprise, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected yet more bitcoin ETF applications, this time by Grayscale Investments and Bitwise Asset Management.  Grayscale almost immediately filed a petition for review with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., asking the federal court system to take a look at the SEC’s decision and either declare it is with the Administrative Procedures Act or possibly just remand the decision back to the SEC but asking it to take another look at the application and review its process as to whether or not the rejection complied with its internal processes.  Disclosure: Grayscale and CoinDesk share a parent company in Digital Currency Group. CoinDesk remains editorially independent of all DCG companies.  The SEC reiterated its at this point very frequent concerns that there is the potential for market manipulation, that the stablecoin tether (USDT) might be used to manipulate the market and that it does not believe that Grayscale or its partner, the NYSE Arca exchange, have met their obligations to reassure the SEC that this is not possible.  For its part, Grayscale says the approval of bitcoin futures ETF products should indicate that a spot market-based ETF product is safe for consumers. In the words of Grayscale Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm, like products should receive like treatment.  To better understand the SEC’s rejection, we should probably take a look at the Teucrium futures ETF approval. This is the bitcoin futures ETF that was filed under the same law that all the spot ETF applications have been filed under. When it was approved earlier this year, a lot of bitcoin ETF advocates said they believed it was a sign the SEC might actually be willing to budge on the spot bitcoin applications.  The reasoning is this: SEC Chair Gary Gensler said last year that he was comfortable with futures ETFs filed under a specific law because that law enshrined certain consumer protections. The law that will govern spot bitcoin ETFs does not have the same protections.  In approving a futures ETF filed under the other law, the SEC opened the door to a spot ETF under that law, these advocates said.  (I’m keeping things relatively simple and vague – these are the 1940 and 1933-34 Acts, respectively, for those of you curious.)  The Teucrium approval also addressed the market manipulation concerns, saying:  “As Arca states, as a Designated Contracts Market … the CME ‘comprehensively surveils futures market conditions and price movements on a realtime and ongoing basis in order to detect and prevent price distortions, including price distortions caused by manipulative efforts.’ Thus the CME’s surveillance can reasonably be relied upon to capture the effects on the CME bitcoin futures market caused by a person attempting to manipulate the proposed futures [exchange-traded product] by manipulating the price of CME bitcoin futures contracts, whether that attempt is made by directly trading on the CME bitcoin futures market or indirectly by trading outside of the CME bitcoin futures market. As such, when the CME shares its surveillance information with Arca, the information would assist in detecting and deterring fraudulent or manipulative misconduct related to the non-cash assets held by the proposed ETP.”  In other words, the SEC believes the CME can identify futures market manipulation regardless of how it’s attempted, even if the CME futures market is based on the price of bitcoin in some spot markets.  As a footnote in the Teucrium approval notes, “the CME CF BRR aggregates the trade flow of major bitcoin spot platforms during a specific calculation window into a once-a-day reference rate of the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin.”  At the same time, the SEC says it does not believe that the CME’s specific surveillance tools would be able to identify manipulation of the spot market “even if the Exchange or the Sponsor had demonstrated a link between the BRR and/or the Index and the prices of CME bitcoin futures ETFs/ETPs and/or the proposed ETP, which they have not.”  Once again, we must turn to the footnotes for the real juice. In footnote 46 of the Teucrium order, the SEC states that its reasoning in approving a futures ETF based on the CME’s ability to spot futures market manipulation “does not extend to spot bitcoin ETPs. Spot bitcoin markets are not currently ‘regulated.’”  In other words, Gensler may indeed be holding the bitcoin ETF “hostage” in an effort to bring crypto exchanges under his agency’s regulatory umbrella.  So what does all this mean for the Grayscale appeal? Meh, who knows. The company staffed up and prepared for this in recent weeks, bringing on former Solicitor General Don Verrilli and having an appeal letter ready to go pretty much immediately.  Christopher LaVigne, a litigation partner at the law firm Withers, told CoinDesk that “Grayscale’s in an uphill battle here,” saying the law tends to be “deferential” to the SEC.  “It’s just whether they made that decision and exercised that discretion in a way that was completely arbitrary, completely capricious and had no grounding in the law,” he said. “I think that’s a hard standard to meet and it’s intentionally a deferential standard. Otherwise, all federal agencies’ decisions would be constantly second guessed and they’d be subject to an unending amount of litigation.”  Bloomberg Intelligence’s James Seyffart pointed out that other industries do have ETFs despite a regulated spot market during a Twitter Space we held last week.  “There's equity markets that the ISG does not have surveillance sharing agreements with, that we have ETFs for,” he said. “My overarching view is more so that the the SEC and Gary Gensler are holding these applications hostage until he can get regulation of the underlying spot market.”  So the next question may be what this actually looks like – it’s hard to see Congress moving swiftly to clarify when or how a crypto trading platform must register as a national securities exchange, and the SEC itself has yet to publish any proposed rule making on the matter.  Cheyenne Ligon contributed reporting.  Markets in Crypto Assets legislation  The European Union’s landmark Markets in Crypto Assets regulation is essentially a done deal now. Jack Schickler explains:  Last week was a big news week in the European Union. The bloc’s Council and Parliament, the two bodies that need to agree on new laws, have done just that twice over – for a landmark Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), and for identity checks on crypto payments. The latter is intended to stamp out money laundering, but with big consequences for privacy – and is an implementation of the international Travel Rule that’s proved so hard to apply in the crypto space.  The final deals seem to have steered clear of some near misses that had plenty of crypto companies sweating. In the end, the laws don’t ban the proof-of-work technology that underpins bitcoin, or impose endless checks on transfers to self-hosted wallets, or force decentralized finance players to register with the authorities (and who would fill out the form, anyway?).  In principle, MiCA offers a sweet deal to crypto companies – who, in exchange for jumping through the EU’s hoops, get to market their wares across the bloc, which is one of the biggest economies in the world. But there’s still some pretty major questions over exactly who will have to sign up to the new system, and whether stablecoin rules that are designed to avoid collapses like terraUSD’s (UST) might strangle the market all together. In particular, there’s a lot of confusion about what the MiCA deal means for non-fungible tokens (NFT) – and whether platforms like OpenSea will have to seek a license as the EU seeks to curb wash trades and other market abuses.  As the first major jurisdiction in the world to have such a comprehensive law, officials reckon they’re setting the tone for the rest of the world, and establishing the EU as the home of sound crypto. With the U.S. contemplating its own legislation on the issue, the bloc may not keep its lead very long.  CoinDesk reported both deals from the Room Where It Happened, here and here.

Here's What Still Needs to Happen Before the EU's MiCA Bill Becomes Law: The European Union is closer to implementing its landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill, but there's a few steps left.

The not entirely pleasant trip lasted almost 10 months. The HBAR price reached the 2020 levels and started the braking process on the weekly timeframe. Of course, slow down is not a reversal. And it is worth seeing the HBAR rebound from the global mark of $0.055 first. However, given the last uncorrected HBAR fall wave from April 2022, the probability of breaking the $0.055 mark without a deep bounce upwards is extremely unlikely. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/yRbz72sM/ The first milestone that buyers should conquer is $0.086. It is at this mark that the first local rebound of the HBAR price can stop. It is from this mark that sellers will try to check the strength of buyers in the range of $0.055. Given the magnitude of the tragedy after the downtrend, it will take some time for buyers to gain positions for growth and buy out aggressive sellers at local lows. Therefore, it is not worth rushing to buy cryptocurrencies without checking the strength of buyers.

42395257,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXpQD,1657284562,"US Job Growth Remains Historically Strong, Exceeding Economists' Expectations","U.S. job growth cooled in June, but still vastly exceeded economists' expectations, a U.S. government report Friday showed.  Employers added 372,000 jobs last month, a minimal slowdown from the revised 384,000 added in May and the lowest since the coronavirus pandemic recovery, a report by the Labor Department on Friday showed. But the figure is still higher than the 275,000 increase predicted by economists, based on a FactSet survey.  The unemployment rate remained at 3.6%, with average hourly earnings up 0.3%, or 10 cents, the June jobs report showed.  Bitcoin (BTC) is down nearly 27% since the last jobs report in early June, and crypto markets continue to grapple with risk-off sentiment by investors as macroeconomic uncertainty persists.  Economists had expected a much bigger slowdown, suggesting the labor market might be cooling off after the U.S. economy added more than half a million jobs on a monthly basis during the recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic. But the June data suggests the job market is still very hot, and it will likely force the Federal Reserve to go through with another 75 basis point (0.75 percentage point) rate hike – faster than the usual increment of 0.25 percentage point.  The U.S. central bank has two responsibilities: price stability and maximum employment. With almost two jobs available for every person seeking employment, the latter is fulfilled.  The other, however, is a bigger challenge for the Fed with inflation still running at a four-decade high, more than quadruple the official target of 2%. Last month, the Federal Reserve had to raise interest rates by a hawkish 75 basis points.  Such accelerated rate hikes look likely for the coming months, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell has hinted at multiple times, and Friday's ""Employment Situation Summary"" will play a critical role in guiding central bankers.  “From the perspective of today, either a 50-basis-point or a 75-basis-point increase seems most likely at our next meeting,” Powell said at a conference following the central bank’s decision in June. “We anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate.”  Fed Governor Christopher Waller and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard are also in favor of a 0.75 percentage point rate hike, they said during a webinar on Thursday.  Higher interest rates could potentially increase the unemployment rate, because companies might have to cut back on spending. Blockchain-focused companies including Crypto.com, BlockFi and Coinbase (COIN) have announced layoffs. Non-crypto companies including Tesla (TSLA) and Netflix (NFLX) have also announced they’ll be cutting jobs.  Powell has repeatedly said he is not worried about the labor market being negatively affected by rising interest rates. He even said the labor market was “too hot,” while Kansas City Federal Reserve President James Bullard called it “sensational.”  “It’s our job to get it to a better place where supply and demand are closer together,” Powell said during a panel hosted by the International Monetary Fund in April.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/08/us-job-growth-remains-historically-strong-exceeding-economists-expectations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a01b0bec73ed915b2f0e762ef81dbba94dfba099-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395254,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXpLI,1657282825,"Aave Proposes Decentralized, Yield-Generating Stablecoin GHO","Aave has proposed the creation of a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin, GHO, as it looks to improve on the features of its lending platform.  The fully collateralized stablecoin will be native to the Aave ecosystem and available on the Ethereum network initially. It is expected to be offered on other Aave-supported blockchains based on future community votes.  Still a proposal, the plan is for Aave to allow users to mint GHO tokens against their supplied collaterals. GHO would be backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies chosen at the users’ discretion, while borrowers would continue earning interest on their underlying collateral.  This would work similarly to existing algorithmic stablecoins, which mint exactly $1 worth of tokens when users provide $1 worth of cryptocurrency. In GHO’s case, a user must supply collateral (at a specific collateral ratio) to be able to mint GHO.  Correspondingly, when a user repays a borrow position (or is liquidated), the GHO protocol burns that user’s GHO, the proposal explained.  All decisions relating to GHO will be in the hands of Aave governance. GHO is expected to generate additional revenue for the Aave DAO by sending 100% of interest payments on GHO borrows to the DAO, the proposal said.  Aave said the GHO stablecoin will rely on “facilitators” for the smooth functioning of GHO. A facilitator, such as another protocol, will have be able to trustlessly generate and burn GHO tokens. The facilitators would have to be approved by Aave governance.  Facilitators, however, will have limits in place to ensure they don’t abuse their powers. “For each facilitator, governance will also have to approve something that we call a bucket. A bucket represents the upward limit of GHO a specific facilitator can generate,” the Aave proposal said.  Borrow interest rates for GHO will be deterehd by the AaveDAO, with a stable rate that may be adapted depending on market conditions. This design retains the Aave protocol’s borrow interest rate model flexibility, and it will be possible in the future to implement any interest rate strategy the Aave community sees fit.  Community voting for the creation of GHO is expected to begin soon. Sentiment among Aave users remained mostly positive as of Friday. However, there were concerns around Aave controlling the interest rates offered to users and the intent of arbitrageurs who would work to maintain GHO’s $1 peg.",POSITIVE,없음,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/08/aave-proposes-decentralized-yield-generating-stablecoin-gho,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfa9129660d4d98600f636688e5537cc394023ff-3085x2314.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At issue are possible violations of the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999 (FEMA), which outlines formalities and procedures for all foreign exchange transactions in India. The law's main objective was to facilitate external trade and payments and ensure orderly development and maintenance of the Indian forex market. The ED is tasked with ensuring compliance with the law and probing violations under the FEMA act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002 (PLMA).  ""Transaction history, relationship with foreign exchanges, how much money is going out of India – ED is examining every detail on offshore transactions,"" an ED official told the Economic Times.  The renewed focus on alleged FEMA violations comes amid the Indian rupee's (INR) continued slide against the U.S. dollar. The INR fell to a record low of 89.40 per dollar on Tuesday, bringing the year-to-date decline to 6%.  Cryptocurrencies allow a free movement of money across political boundaries, bypassing traditional banking channels. Increased outflows through the decentralized crypto setup could put downward pressure on national fiat currency. Further, the system can be used for money laundering and terror funding, as India Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman noted early this year.  Bangalore-based crypto exchange CoinSwitch Kuber confirmed receiving an ED notice: ""We receive queries from various government agencies. Our approach has always been that of transparency. Crypto is an early-stage industry with a lot of potential and we continuously engage with all stakeholders,"" it wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  According to the Economic Times' sources, crypto exchange CoinDCX also received a notice, and the platform's CEO, Sumit Gupta, is cooperating with agency investigators. CoinDesk was awaiting a response from CoinDCX at the time of writing.  India's crypto ecosystem saw explosive growth after the Supreme Court set aside the Reserve Bank of India's banking ban on crypto exchanges in March 2020. That boom, however, attracted the attention of various government agencies. Last year, the ED issued a show-cause notice to Mumbai-based crypto exchange WazirX for transactions involving cryptocurrencies worth Rs 27.91 billion ($382 million).

XRP rose more than 5%, leading gains as bitcoin broke $22,000 in early Asian hours on Friday. Market capitalization almost touched the $1 trillion mark, reaching levels last seen in early June before systemic risks from within the crypto market and a bleak macroeconomic outlook led to steep declines.  Bitcoin (BTC) traded at about $21,600 at publication time, extending weekly gains to more than 10%. ether (ETH) added 3%, while Solana’s SOL, Cardano’s ADA, and BNB showed nominal gains.  Some analysts, however, remained neutral about prospects of a longer-term bitcoin recovery considering the sentiment in broader equity markets.  “The only bitcoin bottom signal for me is persistent data showing us that inflation is convincingly inflecting down,” said Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at crypto broker GlobalBlock. “This should result in the Federal Reserve becoming less aggressive with their monetary policy, and therefore provide confidence that the liquidity crisis in the crypto market is over.”  Policymakers back higher rate hikes  However, in separate comments on Thursday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard backed higher rate increases in the coming months even at the cost of slower growth.  Higher rates would increase the chances of a recession as consumers spend less, potentially hurting the prices of equities as companies miss revenue targets.  That would likely feed through to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Crypto assets have tracked growth and declines in the broader equity markets in recent months.  “We need to move to a much more restrictive setting in terms of interest rates and policy, and we need to do that as quickly as possible,” Waller said Thursday during a webcast hosted by the National Association for Business Economics.  “I am definitely in support of doing another 75-basis-point hike in July, probably 50 in September,” Waller said, adding that a 25-basis-point hike could then be in the cards after that. Concerns that the Fed would tip the U.S. into a recession were overblown, he said, and added that he saw a “good shot” of the economy having a soft landing.  “I think it would make a lot of sense to go with the 75 at this juncture,” Bullard said. “I’ve advocated and continue to advocate getting to 3.5% this year. Then we can see where we are and see how inflation’s developing at that point.”",NEUTRAL,ADA | BTC | XRP,ADA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | XRP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/08/xrp-leads-recovery-among-major-cryptocurrencies-fed-policymakers-back-75-basis-point-hike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/864a96c5b7b29c63ec07df02ad929d3617da5ff4-1757x1318.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It&apos;s all about the fall wave without corrections, the potential of which has simply been exhausted. Starting from the trading week of 13 June, the AXS price stopped in a relatively narrow consolidation range of $13.5-$18. For 4 weeks, market participants have been trying to resolve their relationship in this range. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/a5UJmZIj/ In our opinion, the probability of a breakout of this upward consolidation with the main target of $27.25 is much higher. The main question is how long the consolidation will last before a new growth impulse. An alternative scenario for AXS to continue falling will become possible after breaking down and fixing the AXS price below the $11 mark. In this case, this cryptocurrency will fall into a depression for a long time with a probable final target of $3.

Registration allows Binance to offer crypto exchange and custody services in Spain in compliance with the country's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing rules, it said Friday.  The Bank of Spain's approval follows similar registrations for Binance in France and Italy in recent months.  Having obtained approval to operate in Bahrain, Abu Dhabi and Dubai earlier this year, Binance has been seeking to expand its regulatory ambit in Europe.  Last year, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume received a string of warnings from regulators about its lack of authorization to operate or offer certain services in their markets. These included the U.K. and Italy.  Since then, it has been beefing up its regulatory and compliance teams.

42395260,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXpTA,1657276954,Crypto Mining Stocks Bounce Amid Bitcoin Recovery,"Crypto miners' share prices were up 9.6% between Wednesday and Thursday as bitcoin showed signs of a steady recovery, breaking over the $21,000 mark.  Investors were likely uncertain about how listed miners would react to the bear market, but feel more confident seeing the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap stabilize, Jaran Mellerud, a researcher at Oslo, Norway-based Arcane Research, said.  Digihost Technology, TeraWulf and Marathon Digital led the pack with 26.6%, 18.94% and 17.62% increases respectively from Wednesday's open to Thursday's close. TeraWulf's run came as the company announced on Tuesday that it had added $50 million to a $123.5 million loan signed with Wilmington Trust to continue its growth.  ""It's possible some people are making the bet"" that if bitcoin isn't declining to $18,000, ""then this may be an attractive time to start accumulating some of the miners,"" which are still profitable, said Joseph Vafi, managing director of equities research at investment bank Canaccord Genuity, which covers Argo Blockchain, Iris Energy and Hut 8 Mining.  At the same time, many miners ""are still growing their exahash (a measurement of computing power on the Bitcoin network) pretty nicely this year,"" Vafi said.  Investment bank D.A. Davidson last week slashed its expectation for computing power growth for the rest of the year to include only ""current, funded orders,"" according to a note from senior research analyst Christopher Brendler. However, that still represents a 37% hashrate increase for last three quarters of 2022 for the five miners that Brendler analyzed, including Argo Blockchain, Hut 8 Mining, Core Scientific and Riot Blockchain.  At the same time, the difficulty of mining bitcoin has decreased by about 6.7% since May 22 as miners unplugged unprofitable machines, according to data from information platform Blockchain.com. This makes it easier for the miners left standing to mine bitcoin and bring in revenue.  ""Many of these stocks are very undervalued compared to their assets and cash flows,"" Mellerud said. D.A. Davidson said in last week's note that the risk-to-reward ratio of miners' stocks is better than markets have priced in.  The 15 publicly listed miners CoinDesk analyzed have lost on average of 64% of their stock value in the past two months.  ""The stocks are just moving a little bit with bitcoin coming off of a bottom, honestly,"" Canaccord Genuity's Vafi said, adding that the stock market has also firmed up over the last few days.  Many miners are facing margin calls on debt as the price of their collateral, mostly bitcoin and mining rigs, has decreased, and so they are selling their bitcoin holdings to continue paying their bills.  Vafi said he is ""not particularly concerned that leverage becomes a large issue"" because miners are still profitable, and so they can keep servicing their loan installments. They can also continue selling bitcoin, he said. One possible negative aspect is that their growth will be constrained if they have trouble raising more capital, he said.

Recupero had served as CFO since June 2021 and will be replaced by Chief Accounting Officer Diana Jajeh.  In a letter to employees, CEO Matt Furlong said GameStop is focused on ""eliminating excess costs and operating with an intense owner's mentality.""  GameStop has hired more than 600 people since the start of 2021, but it is now looking to reverse that expansion to reduce expenses. Its shares were down 6% to $126,97 in premarket trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  The company has been taking steps into Web3 over the last year, developing a digital asset wallet for storing crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) ahead of its planned launch of a NFT marketplace later this year.  In its latest quarterly report, GameStop reported proceeds of $76.9 million from digital asset sales. It remains to be seen how much the crypto bear market will affect the company.

42422803,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0pj3h,1657275197,Why Ethereum Name Service Is Seeing a Spike in Domain Registrations,"Ethereum Name Service (ENS) registrations spiked this week as a prominent address sold for hundreds of ether, sparking retail interest.  ENS is a decentralized domain name protocol that runs atop the Ethereum network. It provides users with an easily readable name such as “abc.eth” instead of a complex, long-form alphanumeric address for their crypto wallets, similar to the way the Domain Name System substitutes memorable names such as ""coindesk.com"" for websites' numeric Internet Protocol addresses.  Some ENS buyers treat the names as investments, purchasing popular and common names and selling them for a profit, research firm Delphi Digital said in a note this week. Last week, “000.eth” was sold for a record 300 ether, fueling interest in three-digit ENS names as “traders tried to capitalize on the hype,” Delphi Digital added.  Daily ENS registrations also spiked, reaching over 30,000 new addresses on July 4 and over 20,000 on July 7. This followed a lean period in late May and early June, when registrations ranged between 3,000 and 5,000 a day.  Some analysts noted that ENS addresses were among the most popular and liquid assets trading on NFT marketplace OpenSea.  “The interest we are seeing in ENS is partly driven by the fact that it's one of the very few pure true utility NFTs that are visible, widely known, liquid and traded on OpenSea,” said Anderson Mccutcheon, CEO of Chains, in a Telegram message.  “The difference in value is also less subjective, as an address like ""chains.eth"" is objectively more valuable than ""asd1asdg3.eth,” Mccutcheon said. “The fundamentals and value that ENS addresses are far more certain than other opportunities” for retail crypto investors.  Jeff Mei, chief marketing officer at ChainUp, said the uptick in shorter domain name registrations could be linked to NFT investors preferring the shorter tags due to a presumably higher value.  Other market observers said lower ether and gas prices also incentivized market participants to purchase and trade ENS addresses.  ""ETH gas prices are lower during this bear market environment,"" said Jisu Park, founder at Sooho.

42422800,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0pivh,1657269737,Bitcoin 'Bear Cross' Raises Outlook for Bull Revival,"Yes, you read the headline right. An impending bearish crossover, a technical pattern theoretically suggesting continued weakness in the bitcoin (BTC) price, could be a trap for sellers and portend a bullish revival.  A three-day candlestick chart shows the simple moving average (SMA) of the past 100 candlesticks is on the verge of crossing below the 200-candle SMA, confirming the first bearish crossover of the two averages since December 2018.  Historically, the crossover has marked an end of bear markets and paved the way for notable bull runs.  The averages crossed bearishly in December 2018, trapping sellers on the wrong side of the market. Bitcoin (BTC) bottomed near $3,200 and spent the following three months building a base for a rally. The cryptocurrency hit a high of $13,800 by the end of June 2019.  The bear cross of February 2015 coincided with peak selling, and bitcoin began a multiyear bull run seven months later. The first bear cross, dated June 2012, also trapped sellers on the wrong side of the market.  Crossovers between longer duration moving averages are known to be contrary indicators because they are based on past data and tend to lag prices. The market is often battered, oversold and overdue for a reversal higher by the time the crossover is confirmed.  Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. That said, history could repeat itself because the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkishness, or anti-stimulus stance, appears to have peaked and traders are now pricing interest rate cuts for 2023.
