42379087,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mwdz,1481928533,Overstock Just Closed its First Day of Blockchain Stock Trading,"The first-ever day of stock trading on a blockchain-based, shared ledger has come to a close.  After six-and-a-half hours of being open for business, Overstock.com’s tØ blockchain platform has very little to show in terms of trade activity. In fact, there was almost no activity at all.  But that’s not the point, according to Patrick Byrne, Overstock’s founder and CEO, who has been waging a personal fight against some of Wall Street’s more opaque business practices. In conversation with CoinDesk, Byrne likened the day of trading to test pilot Chuck Yeager breaking the sound-barrier for the first time — but for only a few seconds.  While activity on the tØ blockchain explorer was confined to the verification of two blockchain addresses, the fact that there’s a public record at all is what Byrne says is the most important detail.  In the market ecosystem Byrne imagines, it is exactly this record that will prevent a wide range of profit generation employed by the middlemen responsible for connecting buyers and sellers and helping them settle their transactions.  Byrne explained:  ""There’s a new age coming to humanity riding the blockchain. Over the next decade, what the Internet did to communications, blockchain is going to do to about 150 industries, and capital markets is just one of them.""  Slow start  The reason for the slow start might not be because of lack of interest.  Yesterday, Overstock announced it had raised $10.9m in an unusual offering comprised of $1.9m worth of stock traded via digital assets on the tØ platform. Fifty-five people purchased a total of 126,565 shares for $15.68.  And it's not just investors who stand to benefit from increased transparency.  Byrne cites the recent ""IPO drought"" as evidence that entrepreneurs are increasingly reluctant to list their shares on public stock exchanges from fear the value might be unfairly driven down by price manipulation.  ""It’s like being dropped in a shark tank,"" said Byrne. ""The people who’ve been up to mischief have the most to lose because they can’t do it with a blockchain-based capital market.""  Blockchain obstacles  While multiple parties have posted sell offers, the difficulty that inhibits new people from creating and capitalizing accounts has prevented purchases from being made, according to Byrne.  Overstock’s broker-dealer Keystone Capital yesterday released instructions to investors looking to participate in the offering, including details on how to create an account and add funds.  While Byrne said he would have preferred to let investors know sooner, Keystone Capital CEO Steven Capozza described the onboarding process as ""extremely smooth and orderly.""  ""We continue to open new accounts and there appears to be a good amount of interest,"" Capozza told CoinDesk. ""The shares from the rights offering have been credited to the accounts and new accounts are being opened and funded for secondary trading.""  Byrne expects that as these accounts are activated, the trading session set to begin at 9:30am ET on Monday will be more active than today.  A bold proposal  Johnathan Johnson, the president of Overstock subsidiary Medici (which developed the tØ platform) told CoinDesk he expects additional firms to list over time.  The result, he said, would be a small but growing ecosystem of stocks that are easy for regulators to audit.  Yet as far as introducing radical transparency to the stock trading ecosystem is concerned, Byrne has another strategy up his sleeve.  Last month, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates post-trade in the US, approved a plan to create a ""consolidated audit trail"", a plan the regulator estimates will cost $3.4bn to implement and an additional $1.7bn per year to run.  As the federal regulatory body is taking these steps to force shady trades into the light, Byrne told CoinDesk that he’ll build them a blockchain-based audit trail at no cost instead.  Byrne noted:  ""The SEC has half a billion dollars to create a consolidated audit train and it falls out of our office for free. We’ll give it to them for free if they use our system.""

42379099,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mwrp,1481926647,Bitcoin Prices Fluctuate Around $780,"Bitcoin (BTC) prices repeatedly surpassed $780 on 16th December, a feat that up until today has only been achieved a handful of times since February 2014.  The digital currency first exceeded this price level today at 12:15 UTC, reaching $780.08 before falling back down to as little as $779.75 at 12:30 UTC, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal.  The digital currency continued to fluctuate within a very tight range over the next several hours, falling to as little as $779.41 at 13:45 UTC and rising to as much as $781.07 at 16:45 UTC, BPI data shows.  Bitcoin prices stayed within this range until 18:00 UTC, when they closed at $779.53 and remained below $780.  This tight, range-bound activity continued at the time of report, as BPI figures showed bitcoin prices were trading at $780.18.  Bitcoin prices have been trading at elevated levels, staying north of $760 since 7th December and surging to a 34-month high of $788.49 on 13th December.

42379091,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mwhl,1481909105,ABN Amro Tests Blockchain for Real Estate Transactions,"ABN Amro has begun a new blockchain pilot focused on real estate transactions.  The Dutch bank said yesterday that it is working with IBM to develop a system in which buyers, sellers, brokers and regulators (among other parties) can share and record real estate transactions.  According to ABN Amro, the proposed system would support connectivity with regulators such as the country's central bank and the Land Registry Office. In its announcement, ABN Amro suggested that the pilot could ultimately lead to new kinds of client-facing services.  The bank said in a statement:  “This latest pilot is part of the bank’s strategy to offer innovative solutions for commercial real estate financing.”  The project is the latest for the Amsterdam-based bank. In October, ABN Amro announced that it was working with Delft University of Technology to develop a range of prototypes. At the time, the two sides said that the pilots they develop would ultimately be open-sourced.  ABN Amro is also part of a recently announced project involving the Port of Rotterdam, Europe's largest port, to develop logistics tools using blockchain.

42379104,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mwy7,1481896813,5 Things the Bitcoin and Blockchain Industry Needs to Stop Saying in 2017,"In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, journalist Bailey Reutzel takes aim at some of the dominant talking points in the bitcoin and blockchain space today.  The bitcoin and blockchain industry continues to grow, but as new people begin to take notice, they’re often greeted with the same tired talking points.  As we head into 2017, some of those talking points should be left by the roadside entirely.  Below, let's review the blockchain tropes that are not only hypocritical, but also unimportant to the greater goal of the technology.  1. To the moon  Bitwala tweeted a question that was posed to Eric Martindale and his response at this year’s Money2020.    Q: Price of #Bitcoin #Money2020 2017? A: 6000 USD! - @martindale To the moon!        — Bitwala (@bitwala) October 24, 2016      Is there any reason to still give lip service to outrageous predictions about the bitcoin price? Predictions that last year and the year before were all wrong.  Bitcoin could hit $10,000 per bitcoin by 2018. Seriously, Tim Draper? I guess there’s still plenty of time for his prediction. Not so much for Pantera Capital’s 2014 prediction of $10,000 per coin that year.  Earlier this month, Saxo Bank offered an (albeit 'outrageous') prediction that bitcoin could hit $2,000 next year because of the supposed spending spree of President-elect Donald Trump after he takes office in the US, not to mention the currency restrictions of both China and India.  Not only is talking about the bitcoin price irrelevant to its goal as an alternative currency and payment method, but it also does nothing more than spark more speculative fervor.  According to Coinbase, about 70% of the transactions on its platform are speculative in nature, while only 30% are used for actual payments. So, hyping the price of bitcoin merely makes day traders richer. Nothing wrong with that, per se, although as I’ve always said, not really the altruistic goal.  So let’s stop saying things like this: “If you bought $1k in Facebook shares at IPO and $1k in bitcoin at the same time, your FB shares would be $3200 vs $141,000 for your bitcoin.”  Thanks, in hindsight, Roger Ver. We get it, you made millions.  2. Blockchains for EVERYTHING!!!    Blockchains will fundamentally upend most of today's business models: https://t.co/ykF3oYhYRS        — Fred Ehrsam (@FEhrsam) October 19, 2016      Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase, tweeted this with a link to his column in The Wall Street Journal about how blockchain could totally rework corporate structure. In his mind (and many others), centralized institutions will fall to decentralized software protocols that allow people to do everything peer-to-peer.  While decentralized networks make sense in some cases, in others they are truly inefficient. They’re hard to manage, ask anyone that’s worked on projects of this nature, including Bitcoin Core developers who lament the process for getting consensus.  Many blockchain entrepreneurs speak in broad, abstract concepts (snake oil) that don’t dig into the technicals of how the technology will be able to solve issues faced by those industries. Many times, it’s because these entrepreneurs aren’t exactly clear how and why current industries, like healthcare, operate the way they do.  This empty-headed optimism also rubs off on the consumer value proposition as well, with many evangelists wondering why anyone would use paper money, checks, cards or anything other than cryptocurrency to transact.  The sentiment is at times pompous, lumping every consumer – from grandmothers to business owners to teenagers – into one category, even though these demographics have very different incentives and disincentives for transacting in particular ways.  3. No complaining  Andreas Antonopoulos, an industry pundit recently tweeted:    Profitable bitcoin companies that have never contributed anything to bitcoin dev or open source code have no basis to complain. #takers        — Andreas (@aantonop) December 8, 2016      That’s funny. What happened to “We are all Satoshi?” I guess that only applies if you agree with Antonopoulos. Sounds a bit tyrannical for someone that hates the state.  This is exaggerated throughout the sector. When someone disagrees, there’s not civil, educated discourse, there’s bullying. Opponents, or just those with a little different worldview, get verbally attacked by people hiding, many times, behind pseudonymous profiles.  The real problem, though, is that while bitcoin developers have created and maintained a protocol for businesses to use, businesses have made it easier to interact with that protocol. And in turn, have onboarded significant amounts of people.  This uptake brought even more developers and entrepreneurs, even more consumers and even more investors into the space.  As Tim Swanson, director of market research at R3CEV tweeted:    it's par 4 the course 2 see @jerallaire being villified & trolled by a community that has directly benefited from his entrepreneurial effort        — Tim Swanson (@ofnumbers) December 9, 2016      While these companies should give back to the developers of the protocol (just like every company that runs online should give back to the open-source community that keeps the Internet maintained), these businesses still get a voice in the industry.  4. Code is law  Less than three months before The DAO hack, Stephan Tual, founder and chief operating office of Slock.it, the company that developed the free and open-source software for The DAO, tweeted:    ""But, how can I sue a DAO?"" said the confused decentralization activist. Code is Law. #ethereum #blockchain        — Stephan Tual (@stephantual) March 21, 2016      This was after publishing an introductory blog post that stated, “A DAO is an organization that’s self-governing and not influenced by outside forces: its software operates on its own, with its by-laws immutably written on the blockchain, not controlled by its creators.”  Immutably, huh?  And another one, only a couple of days before the attack, emphasis on the picture from Slock.it, retweeted by founder and chief technology officer, Christopher Jentzsch:    Proposal Framework 1.0 + DAO 1.1 draft! https://t.co/fhkiwFbli5 - #theDao #ethereum #blockchain pic.twitter.com/4qMvibpUHH        — Slock.it (@slockitproject) June 11, 2016      For as much testing and verification as The DAO code supposedly got, no one noticed the recursive calling vulnerability that allowed The DAO attacker to – under the conditions of the code – move more than $60m-worth of investor ether into his own account.  Decentralized software cannot code away social problems (a class that many problems are). The DAO, not only its fallout, gives the industry an example.  Using the number of tokens an individual holds as a basis for their reputation and, in turn their decision making power, only leaves those less socio-economically sound at a disadvantage, the same disadvantage they struggle with in today’s more traditional systems.  In parallel with this mantra is one of victim blaming, one that states that people should be free to invest in whatever they want, and if they lose because of a vulnerability in the code they should have more closely examined the code.  It’s the same nonsense that happens when someone’s phone gets hacked and their sexy pictures exposed on the Internet. They shouldn’t have taken them or they should have had better passwords.  It’s similar to the cryptocurrency community’s stance on initial coin offerings (ICOs), crowdfunding campaigns that sell native cryptocurrency tokens to people in an effort to fund the development of their platform.  But with the belief that those that participate should know every risk, especially in a technological area that’s new and opaque, this has lead many people to get screwed by pump-and-dump schemes and all-out scams.  While knowing the risks and how to parse the code is beneficial if not necessary, that doesn’t mean the industry should excuse the scammer from consequences.  A more appropriate slogan, which has gained some steam after Primavera De Filippi and Samer Hassan published an academic paper on the topic, is “law is code”. In the paper, the two suggest that law can be defined as code, but that code comes with limitations since it’s difficult to render ambiguous and flexible legal documents into a language for a machine.  5. Everything’s a blockchain  What is blockchain?  It’s a term that many years on, the industry is still trying to define. Typically, the definition depends on whether you put an “a” or “the” before the word.  Yet blockchain has also become interchangeable with distributed ledger technology and distributed ledger technology can really be damn near anything that looks to pass information between more than a couple of parties.  Pushing the obscurity forward, William Mougayar, author of ""The Business Blockchain"" and an adviser at several blockchain startup projects, tweeted out a link to a post he penned likening blockchain to the Google Docs’ feature for simultaneous editing:    If You Understand Google Docs, You Can Understand Blockchain https://t.co/rjAUmRMmX9 via @CoinDesk        — William Mougayar (@wmougayar) September 8, 2016      It’s not only confusing, but misleading, stripping bitcoin (which launched the first blockchain) of its delicate balance of economic incentives that make the protocol something more innovative than a traditional database.  According to James Wester, a research director responsible for global payments at IDC Financial Insights, the term “blockchain” has lost its mystique.  “It works still for outsiders, but inside the industry these blanket terms almost signal that the person you’re talking to doesn’t have a good grasp on what goes on underneath,” he said.

42379109,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mwwr,1481889439,Regulating ICOs: Striking a Balance in 2017,"Iliana Oris Valiente is a finance professional (CPA, CA) leading Rubix, a Deloitte-backed blockchain venture.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review feature, Valiente discusses how blockchain technology is impacting venture capital – and why that brings both cause for excitement and pause heading into 2017.  Please note the views reflected are those of the author, not their employer. The below is not meant to be construed as legal or financial advice.  ICOs, or initial coin offerings, have garnered substantial attention in the past few months and unsurprisingly the majority of the analysis to date has centered on the debate over whether a particular coin or token should be considered a security, and the technical considerations for setting up such an investment vehicle.  In the midst of this, notably absent are the regulatory bodies to provide appropriate guidance in demystifying the treatment of ICOs and carrying out their role as stewards of the public interest.  Here's the simple explanation as to why this topic should be at the forefront of regulatory discussions: ICOs allow anyone in the world with a computer and an Internet connection to invest in projects, initiatives or ventures anywhere in the world by means of digital token purchases.  This is fundamentally disruptive and a tremendous feat to bring much needed innovation to the world of traditional investment vehicles; the closest analogy to existing financial mechanisms would be a blend between an IPO and an equity crowd-funding raise.  The ICO process brings up more questions that are not being adequately covered:  Who are the investors?  Where are the funds coming from?  Who are the people behind the ICO?  How is the consumer being made aware of the suitability of the investment according to their risk profile?  These are all questions the regulators should be asking, although there are no clear answers since it’s neither an IPO nor an equity crowd-funding raise, and it may or may not be a security.  In fact, there may not even be an active role for the regulator to play in a world where the ICO phenomenon is occurring in a completely decentralized fashion outside of the traditional jurisdictional boundaries and prior financial infrastructures.  Complexity in the eye of the beholder  What is clear is that ICOs introduce complexities for three distinct groups of stakeholders:  Issuers  As an issuer, the onus is there to be proactive in understanding the few rules that do exist and self-comply with emerging best practices.  From a technology perspective, open-source guidance such as ERC 20 provide the basis for standardizing key token functions; these guidelines are focused more on aligning on interfaces and software security, not necessarily with end-investor protection in mind.  In the absence of regulator input, industry players Coinbase and others have taken the initiative to create a legal framework to catalogue the main considerations that issuers should be aware of to help them determine if their token is likely to be treated as a security.  The goal behind the framework was to create a decision matrix to help developers incorporate design decisions that are less likely to land them in legal trouble down the line.  Investors  As an investor, caveat emptor is still in effect – significant research and taking on the risk of failure are still required.  The role that VCs typically play in vetting and reviewing startups or projects is now in the hands of the retail investor. And unlike traditional investments available to consumers, there are no existing safeguards.  For the time being, the old words of wisdom still apply: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is; if you can’t afford to lose all of that money tomorrow, don’t invest.  Regulators  Regulators certainly have their work cut out for them. What’s perhaps most unsettling from their perspective is that with or without their active involvement, ICOs have proven a new model that will continue to evolve and perhaps outside of the regulatory reach to a certain extent.  Yet the implications for consumer protection, and the broader market stability implications are too significant to ignore; another DAO-style raise of $160 million and subsequent hack could shake the trust in the blockchain ecosystem, hindering future investments while also having a devastating effect on consumers.  Overwhelming challenge  The precarious legal position of the issuers and the potential exposure to risk of the retail investor is precisely the reason that this needs to be a priority on the regulatory agenda.  To their credit, regulators worldwide are taking steps in the right direction. The UK, Singapore, and Hong Kong have all moved to set up sandboxed environments for blockchain-based companies to experiment.  The state of Delaware and the state of Illinois have both been pro-active in declaring their jurisdictions as forward-looking to promote blockchain adoption, having taken a close look at the lessons learned from the New York State Department of Financial Services BitLicense regulatory framework from 2015.  Despite these positive developments, very little is publicly available as it pertains to the view of the regulators on the ICO subject specifically. I suspect that’s in part due to the overwhelming challenge of staying on top of the rapid pace of change in the blockchain space.  For the regulators tasked with overseeing a diverse number of portfolios or potential issues at a 30,000-foot view, it’s possible that the ICO wave has yet to hit their radar.  Why do we need a regulator’s input?  As much as the blockchain community can be portrayed as relying solely on the decentralized nature of the technology and proclaiming that the future lies in self-governing smart contract code, the reality is that code is not yet considered to be law, VCs are waiting for this technology to leave the grey zone of ambiguity, and consumers may in fact need and want additional protection.  In an ideal world, all would end well if:  Technology standards are created and ratified by the community and adopted by prospective ICO issuers  Investors are sophisticated and understand the difference between investing in tokens to fund a centrally organized distributed entity (CODE), a decentralized autonomous organization DAO, or a new platform all together  Investors select the ICOs that match their unique risk profile and are part of a well-diversified portfolio  The teams behind the ICOs deliver on their promises, roadmap objectives are clearly communicated and met according to plan  Investors have a long and happy set of interactions with the entity behind the raise, long-term value is created and dispute resolution is never required.  Unfortunately, the reality is that this is unchartered territory. And if we use the example of the DAO, there are over 20,000 investors, at least a fraction of whom would have arguably been unfamiliar with the nuances of wallets, key management best practices, how to convert out of the DAO holdings, and so on.  In fact, the only way that an investor would become aware that anything was wrong with The DAO was through the media coverage. For the blockchain community, which has already gotten into the daily habit of catching up on all crypto-news from a few sources, this may appear to be a non-issue.  Yet traditional investors have grown to rely on the intermediaries that manage their portfolios for them, making changes in holdings as new information becomes available, and sending alerts as appropriate – all under the auspice of a watchful regulator making sure that the rights of the investors are held up as being of paramount importance.  The risks of blockchain investments are magnified for newcomers to the blockchain space who have a hard time deciphering important nuances that should in fact drive their decisions.  So what's a regulator to do?  As it relates to this specific topic, there are a few suggested courses of action:  Learn and engage with the community  As an example, a few weeks ago, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) ran the first ever hackathon by a Canadian regulator.  The problem statement was simple:  “The financial services regulatory environment is becoming increasingly complex. Solutions that help streamline the regulatory environment are beneficial not only for regulators, but also for the regulated organizations and even for the economy as a whole. Bring your strategists, subject matter experts, developers and UX designers together for three days of purposeful interaction, and make your mark contributing to a more efficient Canadian regulatory ecosystem.”  And the OSC encouraged the use of blockchain technology to address some of these issues, going as far as to include a blockchain SME, Ethan Wilding, on the judging panel.  The results must have been surprising to the organizers, given that more than half of the teams ultimately pitched blockchain-affiliated solutions and two of the teams introduced the ICO concept. The first team suggested that the role of the OSC could evolve to provide technology reviews and automated testing of ICO code, potentially taking on some of the responsibilities that a VC would typically perform as part of a technical due diligence.  The team I was on built a prototype for a voluntary registration program for ICO issuers, a smart contract template for issuers to implement a hypothetical OSC-standard ICO, leading to an OSC-branded investor portal to help consumers compare multiple ICOs and select from a list curated by a neutral party that has no vested financial interest in promoting a specific investment.  In both of the previous scenarios, the traditional role of a regulator such as the OSC would evolve to undertake functions not typically in their purview.  Also likely is that regulators will be required to create new standards and issue new guidance, ideally preceded with close collaboration with the ecosystem players who would be impacted. Even if this topic is on their radar, the software at hand is very low-level and it’s not obvious how a non-specialist would figure out what’s going on in isolation.  This brings us to the second point of what the regulators could be doing...  Design next steps appropriately, taking due care to do no harm  I think the regulators will be pleasantly surprised to find that embedded in the ethos of the blockchain community is the desire to self-regulate and achieve consensus in community-driven ways.  That has given rise to the efforts already underway to create technology standards and best practices that many ICO issuers are keen to abide by, and the guidance issued by prominent investors in this space outlining key things to consider in evaluating ICOs.  Yet industry observer William Mougayar made the sensible comment:  “[If] we don’t self-govern to higher standards, the regulators will come and put a damper on this journey.”  In support of a measured approach to regulation  When it comes to ICOs, it will take time to see how these various initiatives will go, and we can only hope to avoid another DAO-scale breakdown. But, in the meanwhile, I think that regulators would be well advised to take steps to investigate ways to improve the protection of the investing public.  In anticipation of the counter argument that the rights and obligations of the investors or shareholders are included in the underlying code of the project and therefore regulator involvement is not needed, my take is that it’s only consolation if the investors at hand are both:  Financially literate and capable of understanding complex investment options with information presented in a wide array of formats and with non-standardized data points  Technically proficient to understand the underlying code to go and verify claims made by the team behind an investment ICO proposal.  That’s a high bar to set, given that with any new technology there will be asymmetric knowledge and varying levels of understanding, and, in the blockchain world specifically, there is a disconnect between the “business level” explanations behind how something works and the ability to appreciate the complex technical workings under the hood at the developer level.  Thinking creatively  Until such time that issuers and curators of ICO projects and investors have applied tried and true information sharing, risk management and governance models that evolve to capture all sorts of edge-cases, there will continue to be a knowledge gap.  And that’s where regulators typically step in – to protect consumers and provide operational certainty to the ecosystem of participants to facilitate efficient markets.  Yet the fact that ICOs do not neatly fall into any of the traditional categories of investments, will make the process of expanding the regulatory parameter to include ICOs and token trading, and applying measured regulation inherently difficult.  On the bright side, this provides an opportunity for the blockchain community to come together with the regulatory world and flex some critical thinking muscles, keeping in mind that we’re at a crossroads and should look at this as a chance to think about the “spirit” of the law, when the letter of the law is not applicable.  And the first step to accomplishing that must be the acknowledgement that technology cannot and should not exist in a vacuum.  Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016? A prediction for the year ahead?
