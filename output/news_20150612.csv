42426408,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN9fh,1434142587,US Treasury: Bitcoin's Use in Funding Terrorism 'Unclear',"A new US Treasury Department study reports that bitcoin could possibly be used to fund terrorism but says the actual risk posed remains uncertain.  The National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment, published 12th June, includes virtual currencies on a list of ""potential emerging"" risks as a tool for funding terrorism, stating that bitcoin ""may be vulnerable to abuse by terrorist financiers"".  The report notes:  ""Given the attractiveness of virtual currency to conduct illicit financial transactions, the possibility exists that terrorist groups may use these new payment systems to transfer funds collected in the United States to terrorist groups and their supporters located outside of the United States, although the degree to which this presents a residual TF [terrorist financing] risk is unclear.""  The Treasury Department suggested that the use of virtual currencies by criminals looking to launder illicit gains may serve as an example for terrorism funders. The report outlined how ""the U.S. Secret Service has observed that criminals are looking for and finding virtual currencies that offer anonymity for both users and transactions"".  For now, the report asserts, terrorist groups are relying on cash to facilitate the transfer of funds worldwide, an outcome fuelled by broad financial surveillance in the global banking system.  Other methods, including charity fraud, also present significant terrorism financing risks.

42426402,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN9rh,1434137022,Lloyd's Report: Bitcoin Will Always Be Risky,"Bitcoin's security risk will ""never be reduced to zero"", according to a report released by insurance market Lloyd’s today.  The 31-page document, commissioned to assess the risks involved in insuring bitcoin operations, warns that companies will continue to face a ""dynamic threat"", regardless of their security practices.  Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at London School of Economics (LSE) and one of the report's authors, told CoinDesk that while security in the industry is tightening, systemic issues remain:  ""The improvements we’re seeing in many bitcoin risk areas, particularly at the firm level with the incorporation of multisig and other industry best practices, have been well documented. What has been covered less is how many old risks remain (eg 51% attacks) and new risks that are emerging.""  He cited the fact that the majority of mining takes place inside ‘The Great Firewall of China’ as one of his concerns. The report mentions several others: bitcoin's volatility, its lack of liquidity and an uncertain regulatory climate.  Though these global issues are important in shaping the ""overall risk profile"" of bitcoin, the report says they are unlikely to be transferred directly in a policy.  Risky businesses  For the growing number of bitcoin businesses applying for insurance, there are other risk factors in play. Coin Center's Jerry Brito and Peter Van Valkenburgh outline the 'local' threats faced by companies (ie insider attacks) and the kinds of solutions that may help prevent them: server-side security, multisig or hybrid wallets and cold storage.  The duo also address the poor track record of exchanges in guarding bitcoins to date, citing early research that 45% of the exchanges tracked failed.  ""Rather than quantifying risk from past performance, Coin Center advises that insurers and industry observers keep tabs on whether a business is employing these new controls,"" the authors write.  On the whole, the takeaway from Bitcoin: Risk Factors for Insurance is mixed. While bitcoin crime is shown to be an order of magnitude larger than credit card fraud, the authors point to signs the ecosystem is maturing.  While it might run against the decentralised ethos of the bitcoin network, the establishment of recognised security standards for enterprises may help bitcoin in the long-term, it says.    ""As with any system of security, measures must evolve with the threat, and their effectiveness will rely on routine and robust application [...] with responsible and innovative risk management, insurance can be a key component of the future of bitcoin.""            Bitcoin insurance  Reporting profits of £3.2bn in 2014, Lloyd's market, one of the oldest of its kind, houses 96 syndicates who underwrite risk. It specialises in ""unusual risk"", including celebrity body parts and space tourism.  Its report, Bitcoin: Risk Factors for Insurance, part of its research series on emerging risks, coincides with the expansion of its cyber division. Currently, Lloyd's holds around 15% of the world's insurance against cyber attacks.  Lloyd's was first linked to bitcoin after a deal to insure London-based vault Elliptic, at the time hailed as a ""milestone"" for the nascent industry, fell through last year.  Since then, bitcoin companies including Circle, Coinbase and Xapo have gone public with details of their insurance policies. However, they are anomalies in a market still lacking in consumer protection.  The tides could be turning however, as more insurers engage with digital currency technology. The Lloyd's report was commissioned, Hileman said, following growing interest expressed by the bitcoin ecosystem in Lloyd’s insurance coverage.  The report's launch and panel discussion at One Lime Street yesterday, was very well attended, he said, adding:  ""The underwriters asked very specific, savvy questions, the type you’d expect from people who are actively examining the suitability of insurance for various aspects of the bitcoin value chain.""  Correction: An earlier version of this report misspelled Jerry Brito's last name.

42426409,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNA3h,1434131419,Political Group Backing Joe Biden Starts Accepting Bitcoin,"A political action committee pushing for US Vice President Joe Biden to seek the presidency has announced it will accept bitcoin donations.  Draft Biden 2016  , according to a report by The Hill, will accept donations in the digital currency. The campaign is using BitPay as a payments processor, allowing donors to contribute up to $100 in bitcoin per year as an in-kind donation.  “This is in keeping with Vice President Biden’s strong support of technology and innovation throughout his career,” Draft Biden 2016 director Joseph Schweitzer told the publication.  The US Federal Election Commission ruled in favor of bitcoin donations last year, following requests from several political campaigns looking to solicit support through the digital currency.  Earlier this year, the presidential campaign for US Senator Rand Paul announced it was accepting bitcoin.

42426403,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN9th,1434128547,Bitcoin in the Headlines: US Teen Sparks ISIL Media Frenzy,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at bitcoin news, analysing media and its impact.  Bitcoin has been scrutinised in the past, but this week's criticism took on a rather unexpected – and perhaps questionable – sense of humour.  The coverage over the last few days also exemplified just how unpredictable the media's attention can be. On the one hand, bitcoin's negative association with terrorist activity reached mass coverage by a wide range of mainstream outlets.  Criticism by a multinational financial services corporation, however, failed to launch the media into a reporting frenzy.  CoinDesk has looked at the top bitcoin-related headlines from across the world.  New York, North Korea  Bitcoin enthusiasts were faced with the release of New York's long-awaited BitLicense last week – a hotly debated state regulation for business handling the digital currency – and its coverage also weaved its way into this week's reporting.  The New York Post's Kevin Dugan said:  ""Ben Lawsky is having a hard time winning over the bitcoin crowd,"" adding ""ShapeShift, a Switzerland-based exchange for digital currencies, slammed the outgoing Department of Financial Services superintendent over new regulations for operating a bitcoin exchange in the Empire State.""  He continued: ""Lawsky's BitLicense, which went into effect last month, collects an ""Orwellian"" amount of information on its users and creates a security risk, according to Erik Voorhees, ShapeShift’s founder and chief executive. Voorhees, 31, likened Lawsky’s bitcoin crackdown to communist rule in North Korea.""  Cited in the piece, Voorhees, said:  “He’s certainly not as bad as Kim Jong Un. Does he require some of the same spying provision on his citizenry? Absolutely.”  The comparison was also picked up by Dealbreaker, which featured an image of Lawsky with a characteristic North Korean haircut.  The article began:  ""Life as an unregulated currency ain’t easy, just ask Bitcoin,"" adding: ""but for Erik Voorhees, CEO of a Swiss-based digital currency exchange called ShapeShift, even a little regulation is pretty bad.""  Thorton Mcenery, the author, said that Vorhees was angry that Lawsky's regulation compelled the users of a ""brand-new currency to transact in at least a dim glow rather than the total darkness they prefer"", concluding:  ""Whether or not you agree with what bitcoin is trying to do – and good arguments are being made form both side – the passive-aggressive vitriol coming off of Voorhees is indicative of the bitcoin community’s general lack of interest in negotiating with its philosophical adversaries and finding a middle way to cryptocurrency acceptance.""  Bitcoin and terrorism  It is obviously not the first time that bitcoin has been mentioned in the context of financing terrorist activities, with rumours of ISIS using the digital currency surfacing earlier this year.  However, this week, reports of a teenager pleading guilty to allegedly encouraging ISIL (or ISIS) supporters on Twitter and instructing them on how to fund terrorism with bitcoin sent the media into a reporting frenzy.  Unsurprising, given that the teenager, ISIL and bitcoin all in one sentence is nothing short of media gold – resulting in over 200 articles during a Google news search.  CoinDesk also covered the news, pointing out that Ali Shukri Amin, who if convicted faces a maximum of 15 years in prison, had previously written for digital currency news site CoinBrief.  The Washington Times, who went with ""Va. teen caught teaching extremists how to covertly fund Islamic State,"" as its headline, noted how the teenager had created a pro-Islamic blog, where he exposed his technical expertise to aspiring jihadis and ISIL supporters. That report noted:  ""The blog provided detailed descriptions of how to use security measures in online communications, encryption and anonymity software, tools and techniques and the use of virtual currency such as bitcoins to anonymously fund the Islamic state, court documents state.""  Writing for the International Business Times, Mary Papenfuss also highlighted bitcoin's role in the teenager's involvement with the terrorist group.  The article read: ""A 17-year-old Virginia boy has pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide material support to a terrorist organisation by suggesting ways Isis could use bitcoin to dodge detection of its ventures and posting thousands of pro-terrorist tweets on Twitter.""  Interestingly, the news captured the attention of local news sources, with Jamaica Observer also touching upon the teen's interest in bitcoin.  Elsewhere, a loosely translated snippet of Venezuela-based El Universal report read: ""Camouflaging funds is possibly because bitcoin, which emerged in January 2009, is a crypto currency, a payment mechanism whose encrypted data is backed its material value.""  MasterCard talks bitcoin  Typically, whenever a renowned financial institution touts bitcoin or the blockchain, the media usually reacts with widespread coverage.  We've seen it happen before, specifically last month, when the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) announced it was launching a bitcoin price index (NYXBT) - resulting in over 50 online articles.  However, this week only saw a couple of media outlets pick up on MasterCard's submission to the UK treasury in response to a call for information on digital currencies last November, recently obtained by CoinDesk via a Freedom of Information (FOI) request.  MasterCard claimed the risks presented by digital currencies outweighed the benefits, and although its submission had the necessary ingredients to hit the big time with mainstream journalists, it failed to deliver. Could it be that criticising bitcoin is no longer trendy?  A Google news search only brought up a few articles – a stark, albeit predictable, contrast to the combination of bitcoin and terrorism.  That aside, Shelly Banjo, a regular on the bitcoin scene, summarised the findings and voiced her opinion on the matter for Quartz:  ""Its [MasterCard's} claims are self-serving, of course, but the company has a fair point. If traditional financial companies that make loans, issue credit, and transfer money all have to follow globally agreed-upon rules to prevent institutional failures, consumer fraud, and illicit activity, then so, too, should the upstarts.""  The International Business Times' Anthony Cuthbertson also covered the submission, as part of a crypto currency round-up which included mentions of a man being robbed at gun point for his bitcoin and Global Drugs Survey's (GDS) findings that online drug sales had surged since the closure of the infamous Silk Road marketplace.  Also writing for the same outlet, Ian Allison puts forward an interesting argument. quoting Marcel Roelants, a former MasterCard employee:  ""If you asked 10 people you'd get 10 opinions, said Roelants, I think MasterCard initially was a bit like 'we don't like this.'""  Allison went on to note that the card provider was being careful, affected by the negative press provided by notorious scams in the bitcoin space.    Terrorism, criticism and regulation heartache. One can only hope that next week's coverage verges more on the somewhat positive, if not balanced, side of the spectrum.

42426395,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN9Zh,1434110112,Russia's Central Bank Meets With Finance Reps for Bitcoin Talks,"Russia's central bank will meet with representatives from the country's financial markets to discuss bitcoin regulation next week, a local news source claims.  Izvestia  , a prominent Moscow-based news outlet, says it is likely that the bank will be supportive of cryptocurrencies.  A loosely translated version of the article, which cited a source close to the central bank, reads:  ""The central bank's stance [on cryptocurrencies] has changed over the last year. The source admitted that the central Bank may authorise and regulate bitcoin – in particular, carrying out transfers and payments to individuals and interconnect them.""  In conversation with CoinDesk, a spokesperson from the Cryptocurrency Foundation Russia (CCFR) expressed disappointment at the news. The group had previously approached various authorities to discuss regulation, they said, however these attempts proved unfruitful.  Questioning the bank's sudden interest in digital currencies, the spokesperson voiced a desire to see an open dialogue with those knowledgeable about financial freedom and civil rights, but again, seemed doubtful this would happen. ""It is unlikely that these people will be heard by officials and their recommendations will be implemented,"" they said.  ""The true supporters of decentralisation will have to forget about their dreams. Russia's regulation will not comply with the ideals of Satoshi Nakamoto.""  CoinDesk contacted Russia's central bank for comment but no reply had been received at the time of press.  Bitcoin in Russia  The meeting follows on from statements by The Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation (MVD) concerning bitcoin regulation in February.  The domestic agency, responsible for establishing government policy and regulation, suggested it would defer the decision to the central bank prior to taking any policy action.  Earlier this year, Russia's media watchdog cut off access to a series of bitcoin-related websites, including Bitcoin.org, Bitcoin.it, BTCsec.com and bitcoin exchange Indacoin. Three .ru domains were also blacklisted.
