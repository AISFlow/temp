42400563,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK4K8,1509140401,Michigan Man Charged for Unlawful Bitcoin Exchange,"A Michigan man has been charged with running an unlicensed money transmitting business after selling nearly $150,000 in bitcoin online.  According to an indictment released by Detroit TV news services WD-IV Friday, 52-year-old Bradley Anthony Stetkiw ran an exchange through the LocalBitcoins website, conducting transactions at restaurants in the Bloomfield area. Stetkiw is alleged to have sold bitcoin as part of a business venture for approximately two years, at a volume that would make him subject to federal anti-money laundering regulations.  Of the total, the documents, filed with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, assert Stetkiw sold more than $56,000 worth of bitcoin to federal agents through six meetings.  According to the indictment:  ""Operating under the user name 'SaltandPepper,' Stetkiw bought, sold and brokered deals for hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoins while failing to comply with the money transmitting business registration requirements set fort in Title 31, United States Code, Section 5330.""  Stetkiw is notably not the first LocalBitcoins user to be charged for trading bitcoin.  Earlier this year, Detroit resident Sal Mansy plead guilty to the charge of operating an unlicensed money services business. He allegedly conducted $2.4 million-worth of transactions over a two-year period ending in July 2015.  Other arrests in Missouri and New York suggest actions against independent U.S. bitcoin sellers are becoming more commonplace.

42400573,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK4Ty,1509132640,SEC Enforcement Director: ICO Fraud Requires 'Thoughtful Approach',"The SEC's new cyber unit appears to be stepping up its rhetoric on ICOs.  Speaking at the Securities Enforcement Forum on Thursday, SEC Division of Enforcement co-director Stephanie Avakian took the opportunity to give a broad overview of the unit's mission, once again emphasizing that token sales, the process by which startups use custom cryptocurrencies for fundraising, would be a focus.  The cyber unit, first announced late last month, has said it will target ""misconduct perpetrated using the dark web,"" particularly where cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are used.  As such, Avakian said that the cyber unit was created to consolidate the regulatory body's expertise on cybercrime, and include a focus on blockchain technology, particularly initial coin offerings.  While blockchain technology can be used to raise funds legitimately, it can also be abused, she said, noting that ""like many legitimate ways of raising capital, the popular appeal of virtual currency and blockchain technology can be an attractive vehicle for fraudulent conduct.""  Referring to a previous SEC report which said digital tokens would be considered the way securities are under U.S. law, she ultimately said blockchain needs a ""consistent, thoughtful approach.""  She said:  ""We think that creating a permanent structure for the consideration of these [ICOs] within the Cyber Unit will ensure continued focus on protecting both investors and market integrity in this space.""

In a new interview with CNBC this week, Sergio Ermotti expressed doubt about cryptocurrencies, stating that the role of the technology still ""needs to be defined.""  However, he was more bullish on private distributed ledger technologies, noting his company has already invested in a partnership with IBM to run international trade transactions on a blockchain.  He told CNBC:  ""I believe there is a future for blockchain technology, and [that] technology will play a big role in changing and reshaping our industry.""  With the remarks, Ermotti joins other financial sector luminaries, such as Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett, who have recently cast doubt on both bitcoin and the cryptocurrency asset class more broadly. Although, he perhaps hinted most at the divide between permissionless blockchain technologies, like bitcoin, and bank-sponsored alternatives.  UBS and IBM's joint project, for example, is called Batavia, and it has been built on the open-source Hyperledger Fabric framework.

Announced Thursday by Riad Salameh, the governor of the Banque du Liban, Lebanon's central bank, it's not yet clear if the project will be based on blockchain technology, though the idea appears to have been addressed in conversation.  According to local news source The Daily Star, Salameh used the opportunity to underscore why cryptocurrencies, which utilize blockchain, were ineffective in serving as national currencies. The comments were made at the 7th Corporate Social Responsibility Lebanon Forum, as part of the conference's opening ceremony.  Salame told attendees:  ""These [bitcoin] are not currencies but rather a commodity whose prices rise and fall without any justification. For this reason, BDL has banned the use of this currency in the Lebanese market.  Elsewhere, he dismissed the cryptocurrency as ""unregulated,"" while reportedly referring to the technology as a threat to current payment systems.  However, Salame was bullish on the idea that money will eventually be digitized.  ""We understand that electronic currency will play a prominent role in the future. But BDL must first make the necessary arrangement before taking this step and develop [a] protection system from cybercrime,"" he said.  No further details nor timeline were reported, and as such, it's possible that Banque du Liban will use other forms of technology to create a centralized digital currency.  Such an option has been pursued in countries like Ecuador and Sweden, though other countries, such as China, are exploring the use of blockchain.  Still, more details should be forthcoming about Lebanon's plans, that is if a proposed timeline is any indication.  According to the report, Salameh said the digital currency will ""be available in the next few years.""

As such, the program will update its Atlas every week, adding use cases, research updates and information on current projects being studied. The Atlas will also include resources ""that anyone can use for evaluation, testing, and potential adoption,"" according to the website.

42400575,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK4Xu,1509114902,Stuck in Limbo? Bitcoin Cash Price Clocks 9-Day High,"Bitcoin cash price caught a fresh bid wave today, reaching a nine-day high of $373.  At press time, the bitcoin cash-U.S. dollar (BCH/USD) exchange rate is trading at $346 levels. The relatively new cryptocurrency has gained 4.12 percent in the last 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.  Still, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a narrow range around $330 in the last two weeks, with only occasional spikes above $350. Meanwhile, the downside was capped below $300 levels.  However, today's price gains look sustainable as trading volumes are on the rise. Notably, the rally to $350 levels on Thursday was backed by a 54 percent boost in volume, according to CoinMarketCap data.  Once again, it seems gains are being fueled by a surge in South Korean trading – volumes on Bithumb (which offers a BCH/KRW pair) are up 42 percent.  Daily chart  So, will BCH build momentum to retake $400? The price action analysis puts the odds of a rally to $400 and beyond above 50 percent.  The above chart shows:  Prices formed a base around $300 and are currently trading at the descending trend line.  Repeated failure on the part of the bears to keep prices below $300 yielded a rally to $370 levels.  The money flow index (MFI) is bullish and sloping upwards, adding credence to the bullish price action.

42400577,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK4Wv,1509109210,Can Blockchain Save Us from the Internet's Original Sin?,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  In this opinion piece, one of a weekly series of columns, Casey looks at how blockchain might free society from the stranglehold of the four giant data hogs of the internet era: Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple.  What's wrong with this picture?  The front page of The Wall Street Journal, Tuesday: ""Amazon Lures 238 Bids for its Second Home.""  It's not a good thing that a single company can get the political leaders of so many American cities and states to scramble over each other to try to lure $5 billion in spending on some new buildings.  The story shows that Amazon's influence over American urban life is far more than one company deserves: over tax policies, over city planning decisions, over the aesthetics and culture of our communities. Society's interests lie in sustaining a dynamic, innovative and evolving economy, not one in which hegemonic companies have oversized sway over everyone's decision-making.  This is the core problem of centralization in the internet age – a pet topic for those of us who believe the ideas behind blockchain technology can point us toward a better economic model.  Amazon is not alone, of course. But it's in a very select group. An acronym has emerged to define the small club of digital behemoths to which it belongs: GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple).  Two other WSJ stories this past week bring home the distorting influence of two other members of that club. One was Christopher Mims' column about Facebook's ""master algorithm,"" which in determining what we see and read is literally dictating how we think. The other was about Google winning the quantum computing race, a prize that will afford the winner unimaginable competitive advantages in data-processing capabilities.  Meanwhile, with my iPhone 6's screen cracked and its functionality deteriorated since I upgraded to iOS 11, I'm tempted to switch to a Samsung phone, but don't want to lose all the data and connectivity that the Apple universe has locked me into. And I know that with the Android OS, I'd just be getting Google's version of the same dependency anyway.  The internet's original sin  How did the GAFA gang get to be so powerful? It comes down to an original sin in the first design of the internet.  The inventors of packet switching and of the basic protocols on which the modern web is built did a masterful job figuring how to move information seamlessly across a distributed network. What they didn't do was resolve the problem of trust.  Since information is power, it is often highly sensitive. So when people share it with each other, they need to know that data can be trusted. But since there was no truly decentralized trust mediation system in place in the 1990s – no permissionless way to solve the Byzantine Generals' Problem – an asymmetric solution was found.  On the one hand, the distribution of public information was disintermediated, which put all centralized providers of that information, especially newspapers and other media outlets, under intense business pressure from blogs and other new information competitors. But on the other, all valuable information – particularly money itself, an especially valuable form of information – was still intermediated by trusted third parties.  It was a centralized solution bolted onto a decentralized information infrastructure.  So, we got website hosting services to manage each site's files. We got certificate authorities to authenticate reliable addresses. We got banks and credit card providers to run the payment system. And since we craved the network that Facebook's community offered and that Amazon's marketplace could reach and Google's search engine could tap, we fed ever more valuable information into the hands of these entities – those that won the early, defining battles to establish dominance of those services.  A new internet version of the trusted third party was born, and it was just as powerful, if not more so, than those archetypal trusted third parties of the pre-internet era: banks.  Only these newcomers' currency isn't dollars, it's data.  A decentralized way forward  Lately, problems such as Facebook's ""fake news"" dilemma and Equifax's cyberbreach have finally begun shining a light on the fundamental flaws of a centralized system for controlling sensitive information. But our economy was suffering long before that as result of this re-intermediation.  Since producers now depend on Amazon to reach their customers, their entire business model – from production processes to their planning strategies – is determined by whatever information is generated by the Seattle company's algorithm. That's an inherent impediment to effective innovation and creates a dependency that limits competitive capabilities.  If you think this level of domination is bad, consider what will happen when we arrive at a world in which artificial intelligence, machine learning and the Internet of Things have combined to ensure that virtually every decision we make is automated by some algorithm. The question ""who owns the data?"" is going to become a much bigger problem.  I don't know if the blockchain will ultimately solve all this. In the blockchain space, there are unsolved challenges relating to how to scale permissionless blockchains such as bitcoin, as well as questions about how much autonomy people want or should have over their own money and their data.  But surely the answer lies somewhere within the core concept of a decentralized trust mechanism that blockchain points to.  Within the model that Satoshi Nakamoto's invention produced – a system for how to agree on the validity of information shared by strangers in an environment of mistrust – we have a new framework for thinking about who gets to manage data in the internet age.  The idea that the global economy of the future will be one in which individuals and small businesses have direct control over their data, and yet can still operate in open markets and generate network effects is an exciting prospect. It's a future in which a more level playing field gives rise to true competition and unleashes the kind of open-source innovation that's needed to solve many of the problems we face.  That world will eventually come. The places that win in that environment will be those that first embrace a new, decentralized model for data sharing and peer-to-peer trading that promotes true competition. The losers will likely include whichever city wins the 2017 beauty contest to host Amazon's new headquarters.

The first attempt ran out of steam at $5,978 yesterday at 13:00 UTC, while a second fell apart at 01:00 UTC today.  As of writing, the BPI is down 0.90 percent at $5,834.  While the reasons for the exhaustion are unknown, it may simply be the case of the formation of a new psychological level, with traders unsure of whether higher prices above $6,000 will hold.  Whatever the reason, the price action analysis calls for vigilance.  Daily chart  The above chart shows:  Bearish price-money flow index (MFI) divergence, indicating the rally ended with the Oct. 21 record highs above $6,100.  Bearish 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA crossover (i.e. 5-day MA cuts 10-day MA from above).  Exhaustion near $6,000 adds credence to the bearish price-MFI divergence and indicates potential for a drop below the 5-day MA of $5,786.  A break below $5,786 would validate the bearish 5-day MA and 10-day MA crossover and could open doors for a drop to head-and-shoulders neckline (red line) support of $5,440.  The rising trend line (blue dotted line) is also likely to offer support around $5,440 levels.  View  As per CoinMarketCap, total bitcoin trading volume dropped 28 percent on Wednesday, and decreased by another 3 percent on Thursday.  This further suggests the rally from $5,376 lacked substance (weak volumes), thus the exhaustion near $6,000 is perhaps to be expected.  Looking ahead to today:  The odds of a break below $5,786 and a drop to $5,440 levels are high.  On the higher side, only a convincing move above $6,000 would open doors for new record highs above $6,200.

42428005,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL59Rh,1509098407,D3 Unveiled: Russian Platform Would Turn Legacy CSDs into Crypto Custodians,"Executives of Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD) have revealed new details about a plan to build a blockchain-based depository platform for safeguarding crypto assets.  The platform, separate from the NSD itself, is designed to turn traditional financial market infrastructures into compliant custodians of digital currencies and tokens.  Related exclusively to CoinDesk, the newly dubbed Decentralized Digital Depository (D3) is being designed to provide institutional investors with a compliant way to own such assets. It incorporates a wallet developed under a partnership disclosed earlier this year with tech provider Waves. Back then, the biggest question was whether or not the central securities depository would be legally allowed to deal with crypto assets.  However, that hurdle appears to be dissipating, with President Vladimir Putin recently mandating that Russia's legislative body modify existing laws to clarify the status of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. This stands to potentially unlock a slew of projects in the country, such as D3, that are in development and are open to enabling currently dormant business opportunities.  ""The main target audience is for investors who do want to invest a big amount of money, but into crypto assets – and we're talking about cryptocurrencies and tokens which are generated during ICOs,"" said Artem Duvanov, director of the NSD and an adviser to D3, adding:  ""But they cannot do that now, because big money normally requires a certain level of transparency – that's the first barrier, which we can remove.""  Because part of the bridge D3 is expected to provide between traditional centralized assets and these new decentralized counterparts is an anti-money laundering (AML) program, the platform is constructed to make it easier for regulators to gain insight into who owns which assets.  In short, Duvanov said, the depository will help collect and maintain all the personal information necessary to comply with know-your-customer (KYC) and AML requirements.  Crypto bank?  But that's not the only way the NSD plans to build D3 with existing financial systems in mind.  The securities depository will look to integrate both cryptocurrency exchanges and traditional custodians into the D3 platform. In this way, the NSD's head of decentralized solutions, Alexander Yakovlev, explained, the platform could eventually result in something similar to a bank, but for crypto assets.  At D3, ""we are trying to solve this by [creating] an environment where each legal entity can be identified and have an account in crypto, like they have normal accounts in banks at the moment, and to have it with safekeeping featured in a distributed manner,"" said Yakovlev, who is also a co-founder of D3.  He and Waves founder Sasha Ivanov are personally funding the project, Yakovlev said.  D3 is also part of a larger effort within the NSD to work with international central securities depositories (CSDs) to ensure blockchain transactions comply with Swift's messaging standard ISO 20022.  Originally designed to let Swift's 11,000 institutional members more seamlessly conduct transactions between one another, ISO 20022 has become the lingua franca of sorts for any large exchange. By encoding this format into D3's blockchain-based smart contracts, Duvanov hopes to prepare the crypto industry for what he expects will be increasing demand for these assets over the next 20 years.  Yakovley said:  ""We are keen to support these current standards ... to have easy integration with the existing CSD system.""  By using a system familiar to existing financial institutions, the builders of D3 are trying to make integration of the platform as easy as possible.  Making waves  Easier integration is also key to the project's success as a place for all different kinds of ICO tokens.  While part of D3 has been built on decentralized trading solution Waves (and the NSD continues to use it), NSD is currently in talks with several other blockchain teams, including Hyperledger Fabric, so that its platform can custody and manage any kind of token, no matter what blockchain it is built on.  That desire is, in part, a component of the NSD's belief that the D3 platform could be a place where ICO issuers hold their annual general meetings (AGMs). Commonplace in more traditional companies, these gatherings are held to discuss the health and future of the company, and are where shareholders vote on topics relative to the shares they own.  Because D3 will provide the NSD insight into who owns how many shares of which tokens, Yakovlev believes the platform will be integral for ICO issuers when they decide to hold annual general meetings of their own.  Last year, the NSD announced it had tested a voting system using the NXT blockchain, in an effort to create a prototype enabling shareholders to more easily vote as part of AGMs or corporate actions.  Pointing to how these two ideas might eventually connect, Yakovlev concluded:  ""We want to provide an infrastructure to have something like general meetings, but with tokens.""

However, it went on to claim that cryptocurrencies are used to ""launder low amounts at high volume.""  The paper comes two years after a similar statement was made in another terrorism financing threat analysis report by the Treasury department. That report took a similar stance, and suggested that, if the use of digital currencies become more widespread in the country, the ""risk could rise.""  The latest report also expects the money laundering risks associated with digital currencies to grow in correlation with the increase in the technology's adoption as a payment method.  The report reads:  ""As the number of businesses accepting digital currency payments grows, there is an increasing risk of criminals using the currencies to launder funds without needing to cash out into non-digital, or 'fiat' currencies.""  In terms of terrorist financing, the use of digital currencies is assessed to be ""unlikely"" to increase in the next five years, the paper states.  The paper further cited the peer-to-peer lending industry, which it said has the potential to be used as a ""terrorist financing tool,"" though no incidences have been observed in the U.K. to date.

According to a patent application released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Thursday, Verisign is considering using blockchain technology as part of a potential new DNS Security Extension (DNSSEC) project.  DNSSEC protocols exist to protect users from accidentally being sent to malicious websites disguised to look like real ones. These protocols verify that the website the user is trying to reach is the one they actually reach.  Verisign proposed potentially building a system which uses a public ledger on a blockchain to store digital certificates, public keys or other authenticating objects.  The DNSSEC protocol would compare the authenticating objects stored on the ledger with the ones returned by the website to confirm they match. Other iterations of the protocol would use public and private keys as an additional security measure.  The use of a blockchain ensures that the objects stored on the ledger are immutable, affirming that the objects are secure from hacking or malicious attacks.  According to the application:  ""A relying party can look up the information from the public ledger by specifying the hash value, and validate that the information so obtained is correct by comparing the received information's hash value to the specified value.""  While the company outlines a number of potential methods for implementing a DNSSEC protocol, it has not indicated any plan to proceed with the development of a new system yet.  Still, the idea that blockchains can be used to store keys for websites is not new, with a number of projects and startups already seeking potential ways to manage web domains using various forms of the technology.

The new venture, called Amentum, is seeking to raise $10 million from individual investors for the first fund and aims to begin putting the money to work at the beginning of 2018.  Among the four general partners, probably the best-known name in the blockchain community is Steven McKie, the former head of growth and product content at Purse.io, the bitcoin shopping site. McKie is joined by Boyma Fahnbulleh, who was previously a software engineer at Chain, the enterprise blockchain software startup.  Another member of the Amentum team is Chris Russ, the private equity investor and a former investment banking analyst at Credit Suisse. Rounding out the quartet is Kyle Forkey, previously a project manager for Pegasus Builders in Wellington, Florida, who now also runs a separate firm specializing in equity-oriented ICOs.  Three of the four Amentum partners are African-American, an unusual level of representation in the crypto space, but that is not the only type of diversity they are emphasizing in their pitch, according to McKie.  There is also ""diversity of mind, diversity of skill set, diversity of the assets which we invest in,"" he said, noting the different professional backgrounds of his co-founders.  He added:  ""The more different types of individuals we have in the space ... the more enriched the space can be in long term.""  Portfolio breakdown  The team plans to invest roughly 70% of the fund in liquid cryptocurrencies – a portfolio that will be actively managed – and reserve the other 30% to selectively deploy in initial coin offerings and public blockchain launches.  The ICO investments will include discounted pre-sales, though not exclusively, McKie said.  Amentum's main investment criteria for a blockchain are sustainability (Does a project have the use cases and committed developer community that will last?), interoperability (Can it integrate with other projects to create additional value?) and security (Is it safe to use?)  According to McKie, it will charge investors the standard ""two and twenty"" management fee – 2% of assets under management plus 20% of the profits.

42427994,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL597h,1509062459,Kansas Commission: Political Candidates Cannot Accept Bitcoin,"A government ethics body in Kansas is advising political candidates to not accept bitcoin.  New guidance from the Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission indicates that election watchdogs in the U.S. state are planning to study the issue further, but for now, campaigns are being told to abstain from taking cryptocurrency contributions.  Mark Skoglund, the commission’s executive director, told CoinDesk he asked the body for guidance after a candidate for public office asked about the option.  While the guidance disallows bitcoin from being used in campaign contributions at present, the door to future acceptance appears to be somewhat open for now.  Skoglund said:  ""That is the current guidance. It is not a formal opinion, but as a director I asked the commission for guidance, and until further studies are conducted, bitcoin cannot be used for a campaign contribution.""  Unlike an advisory opinion, the guidance issued by the commission does not have the force of law. It is unclear whether a formal advisory opinion will be issued in the future.  While there is no set plan for conducting studies on bitcoin or otherwise looking into its use, Skoglund said he intends to compile research on what other states have done and speak to officials from these states during an upcoming conference.  It's a notable development, given that the Federal Election Commission (FEC) – which oversees national-level campaigns – approved the acceptance of bitcoin as an in-kind donation – effectively property that can be contributed – in 2014. Additionally, as previously reported by CoinDesk, the FEC could move to shift the rules around bitcoin, treating them like cash donations instead.
