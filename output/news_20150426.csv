42398320,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTGKn,1430056813,5 Ways to Spend Bitcoin in Amsterdam,"Amsterdam has always been somewhat of a bitcoin haven.      With startups seeking to make the city the ""bitcoin capital of the world"", it has historically attracted high-profile bitcoin events. Last spring, for example, saw the opening of Amsterdam's very own Bitcoin Boulevard, a project that signed up 10 merchants in the city to accept bitcoin.    The Bitcoin Foundation also picked Amsterdam to host its Bitcoin 2014 conference last May in what may have been the most high-profile testament to the city's pull for bitcoin aficionados.  Sander Regtuijt, business development manager at BitStraat, encouraged bitcoin users who haven't yet been to explore its offerings.  Regtuijt said:  ""Visiting Amsterdam because of bitcoin-related reasons would be a good idea, because, besides all the places where you can spend your bitcoin, there is a lively bitcoin community as well.""  With this in mind, CoinDesk takes a look at five different ways in which you can fund a trip to Amsterdam.  1. Traveling with bitcoin  If you want to take in the sun whilst sipping on an ice-cold beer purchased with bitcoin, now is your chance. Did we mention you can do so by one of the city's world-famous canals?  If air travel is the only feasible option for you, then don't panic.  Paying for airplane tickets with bitcoin has never been easier with AirBaltic, Air Lituanica, BTCTrip and CheapAir accepting payments in the digital currency.  2. Accommodation with bitcoin  Now you have your transportation is sorted, but where will you stay?  If you are after a bitcoin-friendly hotel, check out the easyHotel Amsterdam City Centre - located in the “De Pijp” district. The hotel's website offers a bitcoin payment option at checkout and generates a BitPay invoice, QR code and wallet address to settle the payment.      If you are willing to spend more time researching a suitable hotel, then head over to Expedia, which also began accepting bitcoin payments for hotel bookings in June last year.  Alternatively, you can also spend your bitcoin at the Cocomama hotel, a boutique hostel.  Don't be put off by the lack of an obvious bitcoin payment option, the hotel asks you to provide credit or debit card details in guarantee of the booking. Bitcoin payments will be made upon arrival at the premises and must be stated in the comments section of the booking form to avoid your card being charged.        3. Sightseeing with bitcoin  Amsterdam has all the advantages of a big European city: cultural and historical heritage, a lively nightlife scene, international restaurants and thanks to its extensive canal infrastructure – little road traffic, which makes it ideal for cycling.  To make the most of the city, hire a bike. You can do so with bitcoin at Starbikes, where a half-day rental will only set you back an affordable 5€.  If cycling is not for you and you are traveling in a group, why not invest in a boat tour? Amsterdam Boat Events, offers a series of bitcoin-friendly options, including the chance to enjoy a BBQ on board your very own boat.  4. Eating with bitcoin  All the cycling will inevitably work up an appetite. Head over to Cafe Kobalt, within walking distance of Amsterdam's Central Station for a bite to eat or a quick drink.  Barbershop  , a less conventional option, is both a place to hang out and grab a drink or get a hair cut or a shave.  5. Shopping with bitcoin  Whether you want to treat yourself or those back home to a souvenir, Amsterdam offers plenty of options.  Mensocks  described by Regtuijt as a ""funny place with great hosts"", is home to a large variety of unique socks should you be interested in replacing your old alpacas.  If you are a creative type, you may also want to head over to Galerie West, on the Bitcoin Boulevard, and invest in some art.  With its thriving community, Amsterdam is one of the best places in Europe to spend your bitcoin holdings.
