42398777,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgZU7,1445887275,Health Care Giant Philips Exploring Blockchain Applications,"Philips Healthcare has confirmed it is currently exploring potential applications for blockchain technology.  A division of the larger Netherlands-based parent company, Philips Healthcare saw €9.18bn in sales for fiscal year 2013–2014, a figure that doubled the sales recorded by its consumer lifestyle and lighting divisions and accounts for roughly 40% of its revenues, according to The Wall Street Journal.  The company’s interest was first revealed in a tweet by Wayne Vaughan, CEO of blockchain-based record-keeping startup Tierion, who touted the service as a “first project” with the health care company, though no additional details were provided.  In statements, global IT innovation lead Arno Laeven was more subdued in his remarks, suggesting the two companies had worked together, but that there was nothing further to announce at this time.  Laeven told CoinDesk:  ""We are exploring blockchain in relation to health care just the same as we are exploring many new technologies.""  The news coincides with reports Philips is seeking to revamp its health care services following industry-wide growth issues and amid declining sales growth expectations.

42398786,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgZX4,1445882681,Bitcoin Startup Cleared of Breaching Securities Law,"The Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority (FCAA) of Saskatchewan, Canada, has cleared a bitcoin startup of breaching securities law.  A decision from the FCAA panel, announced on 22nd October, found that Dominion Bitcoin Mining Company Ltd did not solicit investors, nor offer shares illegally.  Its statement reads:  ""It is the determination of that Panel that, notwithstanding the initially apparent validity of the allegations of the FCAA staff, an offering of shares did not at material times exist, and the parties did not engage ... in any breach of the provisions of the Act [The Securities Act, 1988].""  The decision follows a 17-month dispute over claims Dominion's founders – Jason Dearborn, Peter Voldeng and Ronald Gibbonthe – had offered securities from their website, dominionbitcoin.com.  During a FCAA hearing, investigator Harvey White presented screenshots from the site, including a page that read: ""By taking part in our offering, you own a share in one of ten provincial companies that own Dominion. That share allows you an equal part in EVERY SINGLE BITCOIN WE EVER MINE.""  Another section of the website stated Dominion was accepting ""sophisticated"" investors from the 10 provinces that make up Canada.  However, the respondents argued that their website was under construction at the time (they allege encrypted data was exposed following a hack) and did not accurately reflect the project's status. In fact, the corporations mentioned on the site did not yet exist – and there were no Dominion securities to sell.  As a result, the founders were cleared. ""The Respondents had no clear picture of what an investor might be investing in,"" the FCAA's document reads.  Future plans  At this point, little is known about Dominion beyond its name. ""We're expecting to actually develop the largest bitcoin mine in Canada,"" President Voldeng told CBC News last September, while plans to trade the currency are reportedly in the works.  The company – whose domain is now disconnected – said it is unlikely to operate in Saskatchewan. Voldeng said it is also planning to sue the FCAA for libel.  While Dominion has been cleared of all allegations, other bitcoin schemes have been revealed to be highly profitable scams.  Last month, US resident Trendon Shavers plead guilty to securities fraud, having received approximately $4.5m while operating the Bitcoin Savings & Trust (BS&T).  The organisation, which was investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2013, promised investors 7% returns on bitcoin arbitrage in 2011 and 2012.

42398783,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgZb0,1445876923,Ebay Files For Two Cryptocurrency Patents,"Multinational e-commerce giant eBay has filed two cryptocurrency-related patent applications.  Published by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) last week, the applications were both submitted on 18th April last year.  According to the filings, eBay wants to patent a ""distributed cryptocurrency unauthorised transfer monitoring system"" and a ""distributed cryptocurrency reputation system"".  Ebay's filings come after the USPTO published Coinbase's applications for nine bitcoin-related products and 21 Inc's filing for a digital currency mining circuitry patent.  Speculation about eBay's possible involvement in crypto has been rife in recent years, with John Donahoe, CEO at the time, hinting at bitcoin integration for PayPal – eBay's former subsidiary – on various occasions.

42398779,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgZT8,1445863564,FBI: Malware Victims Should Pay Bitcoin Ransoms,"Victims of malware, such as bitcoin ransomware Cryptolocker, should just pay off the perpetrators if they want to see their data again, an FBI agent has advised.  According to Security Ledger, Acting Special Agent Joseph Bonavolonta, who oversees the bureau's Boston office, told C-level executives at Wednesday's Cyber Security Summit they'd be better off stumping up the ransom.  According to an FBI report from June, this sum can be anywhere from $200 to $10,000. Bonavolonta said:  ""The amount of money made by these criminals is enormous and that’s because the overwhelming majority of institutions just pay the ransom ... To be honest, we often advise people just to pay the ransom.""  Programs like Cryptolocker and Cryptowall – typically spread through phishing emails – demand bitcoin to unlock files they have encrypted on a user's computer.  The FBI said it had received 992 complaints about (now defunct) Cryptolocker in a 14-month period, with victims reporting losses of $18m. ""Criminals prefer bitcoin because it's easy to use, fast, publicly available, decentralized and provides a sense of heightened security/anonymity,"" its report read.  Because ransomware has found success on such a vast scale, Bonavolonta said attackers are likely to keep their demands low to maximise profit. For this same reason, they are mostly honest, he added: ""You do get your access back.""  No guarantees  Bonavolonta's advice comes counter to many public advisories on the subject to date. In 2013, when Cryptolocker first swept the UK, the National Crime Agency (NCA) issued a statement telling businesses not to pay up.  ""The NCA would never endorse the payment of a ransom to criminals and there is no guarantee that they would honour the payments in any event,"" its statement read.  In April, a security researcher from Kaspersky Labs, Jornt van der Wiel, echoed this sentiment, telling CoinDesk: ""As there are few ways to get files back without paying, users often just give in. This is the wrong strategy, but it’s often the easiest for the user.""  Others, including authorities in The Netherlandshttps://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2015/april/13/11politie-zorgt-voor-doorbraak-in-recente-cryptoware-aanval.html, argue that payment actually helps to perpetuate the problem, as it gives malware operators an incentive to continue – and target new victims.  A 2014 study of 39,760 people from security firm ESNET showed that only 1.4% of victims actually paid the Cryptolocker ransom.  While some were given access to decryption software, others were not – usually because the full amount hadn't been paid.

42398782,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgZa1,1445856686,Australian Securities Exchange 'Considering' Blockchain Technology,"The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) is seriously considering replacing its current clearing and settlement system with blockchain technology, reports claim.  According to the Sydney Morning Herald, ASX CEO Elmer Funke Kupper said blockchain technology could help cut the cost and time associated with its Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS).  The CEO added:  ""We are looking at what we can do to bring end-to-end efficiencies, and we have people looking very closely at blockchain to see if we can create efficiencies for our clients, investors and companies.""  He continued: ""We're thinking about whether there are smarter ways to do things – to remove a lot of administrative costs and reconciliation costs from the back end of investment banking and broking, and this is where blockchain could be potentially quite helpful.""  The upgrade of ASX's clearing and settlement system is expected to begin by the end of next year.  Crypto in Australia  Funke Kupper's comments come after the National Bank of Australia and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia – which is experimenting with Ripple's technology – joined distributed ledger startup R3CEV's project, which seeks to develop standards to spread the use of blockchain technology within the wider financial industry.  The news also follows reports that various banks in Australia had decided to shut down the accounts of bitcoin operating businesses in the country. The closures are currently being investigated by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).
