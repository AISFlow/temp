42381524,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9n4Mn,1549659924,Crypto Tax Bill Clears First Hurdle in New Hampshire Legislature,"A proposed law in New Hampshire that would allow residents to pay their taxes with cryptocurrency is seeing some early traction.  House Bill 470, which would allow state-level agencies (including New Hampshire's tax office) to accept cryptocurrencies for payment if approved, cleared its first minor hurdle last week after being passed unanimously by a subcommittee on the House Executive Departments and Administration Committee, with amendments.  The subcommittee – composed of Reps. Mark Proulx, Jaci Grote, Carol McGuire and Samantha Fox – voted to add some protections for the state as an amendment, ensuring that if a transaction fails or is sent to the wrong address, New Hampshire can still collect on the appropriate taxes.  That being said, the amendment is more technical than substantial, McGuire said, explaining:  ""It's just being more specific about how we do it ... it doesn't change the intent of [the bill] at all.""  The text of the formal amendments was not available at press time. There will be another subcommittee work session on Feb. 13, according to Legiscan.  If the bill is approved by the House and Senate, and signed by Governor Christopher Sununu, it would direct the state treasurer to determine how it may accept cryptocurrencies for tax payments by November 2019. Actual acceptance of cryptocurrencies would then commence in July 2020.  State agencies would have to partner with a to-be-determined third-party processor to convert funds into fiat, similarly to how Ohio currently processes its own crypto tax payments.

42381518,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9n4GV,1549652856,Funds Were Moving On QuadrigaCX Right Before Its Collapse,"Nearly $1 million worth of ether (ETH) left QuadrigaCX and went to other cryptocurrency exchanges in December, the same month its CEO died, a CoinDesk review of public blockchain data shows.  In a series of transactions sent from QuadrigaCX’s hot wallet (meaning one connected to the internet), more than 9,000 ETH moved from the embattled Canadian exchange to accounts at Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken and Poloniex (owned by Circle).  The lion’s share – 5,000 ETH – was transferred from Dec. 2 to Dec. 8 – the day before the recorded death in India of QuadrigaCX founder and CEO Gerald Cotten. Most of the ether sent that week (4,550) ended up at Binance.  It is unclear whether it was the exchange itself that initiated these transactions, its customers, or some combination. But the flows of funds have come under scrutiny in the crypto community because of the company’s growing troubles.  Last week, QuadrigaCX went offline and subsequently filed for creditor protection in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, saying it owes customers $190 million but cannot find its late founder’s private keys to retrieve crypto held in cold storage.  That followed months of customer complaints about withdrawal delays, both for fiat and crypto. But looking at the ethereum blockchain, it is clear that someone was able to move significant amounts of QuadrigaCX as recently as December. (The company did not respond to a request for comment by press time.)  Besides ether, QuadrigaCX also held several other currencies on behalf of customers and users have been trying to identify its wallets on the bitcoin and litecoin blockchains. But ethereum is perhaps the easiest blockchain to follow the money in this case.  That’s because there is an obvious starting point: address 0x027BEEFcBaD782faF69FAD12DeE97Ed894c68549, labeled as QuadrigaCX’s on the block explorer site Etherscan. (It identifies wallets as belonging to specific companies when they request it, subject to verification.)  The money trail  The trail starts in June 2017, the last time the publicly identified QuadrigaCX wallet was used. It was emptied into two other addresses.  One  of the two wallets received 3,000 ETH (around $825,000 at that time) on June 2, 2017. According to Taylor Monahan, founder and CEO of the wallet startup MyCrypto, this wallet is probably a certain user’s deposit account for another exchange, Bitfinex, since funds were regularly put into this wallet from QuadrigaCX addresses and then sent to Bitfinex.  “When you deposit to an exchange, you are given a unique address that is linked to your exchange account,” Monahan explained. “In most exchanges, you send funds to this account, it is automatically recorded in the exchange’s database, that amount shows up on the balances/dashboard of your exchange account, and the funds are moved from your ‘personal deposit address’ to the exchange’s ‘main’ or ‘hot’ wallet.”  The last transaction from this wallet was made on December 3 of last year, sending 1,099 ETH to Bitfinex.  The other wallet that received funds from the original QuadrigaCX address is identified as the exchange’s hot wallet in the court filings (0xB6AaC3b56FF818496B747EA57fCBe42A9aae6218).  Even before that, this address was widely believed to belong to the exchange. It was mentioned in a discussion about long withdrawal waits in a subreddit dedicated to the exchange and in Twitter thread about the problem.  And it is the source of the large transfers that took place in December 2018.  The December transfers  From Dec. 2-7, this wallet sent 4,550 ETH in several large transactions to another wallet which mostly interacted with QuadrigaCX’s addresses. During the same period, the latter wallet sent 4,550 ETH to a now-empty wallet, which most likely is a deposit address for Binance, based on the pattern of usage (funds come in, mostly from the QuadrigaCX-linked address, and then go out to Binance).  However, it’s hard to tell if the wallet sending ETH to the Binance deposit address was controlled by QuadrigaCX or belonged to a client who would send ETH from one exchange to the other. In several instances, funds were sent from this wallet to other addresses.  During the same time, through deposit addresses 177 ETH went to Bitfinex on December 6 and 386 ETH were sent to Kraken on December 8. Overall, during the entire month of December, more than 4,550 ETH were sent from QuadrigaCX to Binance, 2,400 ETH to Poloniex, 1,609 ETH to Bitfinex and 883 ETH to Kraken.  One possible explanation for the large December transfers is that QuadrigaCX sent the funds itself as it needed to convert crypto to fiat to fund its operations. The bank account of the exchange’s payment processor was frozen last year, blocking access to $22 million.  “Whether that is server bills or contractors, at some point you need cash,” said Monahan. “If you have a strained relationship with your banking partners, you may choose to obtain fiat via another mechanism. So it wouldn’t surprise me if an exchange used an [over-the-counter] desk or another exchange in the space in order to move ETH or BTC into fiat and ultimately pay bills.”  However, this explanation only goes so far. Binance and Poloniex weren’t dealing with fiat money at the time of these transactions (Binance launched a fiat-to-crypto exchange in January). So sending to those two exchanges would not have helped with raising operational cash.  As such, the reason for the transfers remains unclear, along with their originators. Binance, Kraken, Poloniex and Bitfinex didn’t respond by press time to CoinDesk’s questions about the deposit addresses listed above.  Cold comfort  Another open question is the degree to which QuadrigaCX kept coins offline, in so-called cold storage, where the private key is not on any device connected to the internet.  In her affidavit filed with the Canadian court, Jennifer Robertson, identified as Cotten’s widow, wrote that the company kept “only a minimal amount of coins” in its hot wallet connected to the internet. In the normal course of business, Cotten “would move the majority of the coins to cold storage,” she wrote, adding that he held “sole responsibility for handling the funds and coins,” and the remaining team members have had no luck accessing the exchange’s cold wallets since.  Observers have been trying unsuccessfully to identify the cold wallets on the blockchain. Monahan said she suspects that the exchange had no cold wallet at all, at least for ether.  “Unless they enacted remarkably different practices in the last year, I would be very surprised to learn of a cold storage ether address based on what I’ve seen so far,” Monahan told CoinDesk. “Almost all of the largest transactions are either sent to exchanges or amongst three ‘primary’ addresses (1, 2, 3). I haven’t seen anything indicating a large reserve or cold storage mechanism being used on the Ethereum chain.”  All told, the analysis of QuadrigaCX’s ether wallets doesn’t look optimistic for the users who have their funds stuck on the exchange, with cryptos bleeding in the direction of other exchanges.  Kraken CEO Jesse Powell commented on the situation in Twitter, writing that his company has “thousands of wallet addresses known to belong to QuadrigaCX” and the team is now investigating “the bizarre and, frankly, unbelievable story of the founder's death and lost keys.” He also offered assistance to Canadian police in case they are investigating the situation.

Litecoin (LTC), the world's fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, led the charge by surging just over 40 percent from its opening price of $33 to reach a 3-month high of $47.  The move was backed by $1.4 billion in trading volume, which is its most since Feb. 20, 2018, according to Coinmarketcap.  Soon after litecoin picked up the strong bid, other well-known cryptocurrencies followed suit.  According to data from CoinDesk's Crypto-Economic Explorer (CEX), seven other cryptocurrencies are currently boasting double-digit 24-hour price increases, including EOS (EOS), ether (ETH), cardano (ADA), bitcoin cash (BCH), IOTA, NEO and lisk (LISK).  The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, bitcoin (BTC) is also flashing green.  BTC opened the day with a price of $3,359 but was able to rise just over 10 percent to reach a 20 day high of $3,702. BTC's price has since slightly pulled back and is now trading at an average price of $3,625, per the CEX.  In all, the capitalization of the broader cryptocurrency market has appreciated roughly 9 percent in the last 24 hours, jumping from $112 billion to $122 billion to clock its highest valuation since Jan. 20th.  As it stands, the market's $122 billion valuation represents an 85 percent depreciation from its all-time high north of $820 billion set in January 2018.

42381532,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9n4Y7,1549648849,TCR Party: The #CryptoTwitter Popularity Contest Everyone’s Talking About,"An experiment is playing out on Twitter that seeks to demonstrate the effectiveness of token-curated registries through a Crypto Twitter popularity contest.  The project is the brainchild of Gregory Rocco, a staffer at ethereum venture studio ConsenSys, who told CoinDesk that he had the idea in the shower several weeks back, leading to its Feb. 4 launch.  The TCR Party, as its dubbed, is being run by ConsenSys project Alpine, which is populated by the former token design team from Token Foundry, which has seen its fortunes shift with the winds of the token space writ-large.  By Thursday, over 250 people were participating in the token-curated registry, which aims to separate Crypto Twitter’s top influencers from its mere wannabes. Users started by tweeting ""Hey @TCRPartyVIP let's party!"" and following the instructions sent to them via direct message.  Rocco, Alpine’s head of strategy, says the TCR Party experiment is a way for mainstream audiences to engage with a technology that incentivizes authoritative list-making.  Speaking to how the bot automates interactions with backend cryptocurrency wallets, Alpine’s Steve Gattuso told CoinDesk:  “Behind the scenes, any time a user registers to participate we actually generate a multisig wallet for them … you basically use the bot as the wallet.”  There are several projects working on TCRs of their own, including mapping startup FOAM and advertising startup MetaX. However, both Rocco and Gattuso are skeptical about TCRs, concerned that they inevitably become plutocratic popularity contests where people amass disproportionate control through token holdings.  “My hunch was that TCRs will end up being plutocracies, where the rich get richer and control the lists,” Gattuso said.  Rocco added:  “We’re already starting to see the benevolent cartels form.”  Play money  Although Alpine plans to continue adding features to this ongoing experiment, Gattuso said it is merely a side project built to gather data and observations. There are no plans to monetize TCR Party.  In fact, TCR Party participants can earn staked testnet tokens simply by interacting with the program. Since the abstracted tokens don’t hold any monetary value, both Alpine researchers contend this experiment isn’t perfectly comparable to projects undergone by enterprise clients.  Edwin Cheung, a software engineer at MetaX, further highlighted this point by telling CoinDesk:  ""Without token economics on the Rinkeby Testnet, it is difficult to predict how people will behave on the Ethereum Mainnet.”  Even so, the Alpine team has already gleaned valuable insights.  The first testnet implementation promptly failed because an influential miner stopped contributing to the network, forcing TCR Party to migrate to another blockchain. Then, Twitter blocked their API access and the Alpine team had to wait to talk with the social media company’s support staff.  Clearly, a TCR is only as reliable as the infrastructure it lives on.  Plus, Rocco pointed out that Alpine’s goal is not to merely “jockey tokens,” but to discover where and how blockchain solutions can offer tangible value.  “Token modeling is just one small component of what the entire team is working on,” he said, adding that more experiments with technology beyond ethereum, such as bitcoin’s lightning network, could be in Alpine’s future.  Alpine isn’t the only team experimenting with TCRs, and others are taking note.  “We're keeping a close eye on these experiments as we work towards releasing our own TCR for Messari's disclosure registry,” Messari CEO Ryan Selkis told CoinDesk, adding:  “Most of the cool tech that's been built in crypto wins initial awareness from the games that are built on top. Satoshi's Place with Lightning, CryptoKitties with NFTs, even Satoshi Dice with bitcoin back in the day.”  Tempering expectations, Gattuso warned against drawing premature conclusions from this light-hearted Twitter experiment.  “We’ll learn a lot more over the next couple of weeks,” Gattuso said. “Maybe this will turn out to be a well curated registry.”  Brady Dale contributed reporting.

42381530,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9n4UL,1549643721,A Fight Is Brewing Among QuadrigaCX Crypto Exchange's Creditors,"Creditors of the failed cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX are bracing for a fight – among themselves.  Customers who had fiat currency balances at the exchange before it went offline and sought protection from creditors in a Canadian court last week are beginning to argue they should be paid back first from recovered assets.  But they expect customers who stored crypto at QuadrigaCX to push back on such demands. And even some fiat holders say such prioritization would be unfair.  ""There seems to be a conflict going on between creditors themselves,"" Canadian resident and QuadrigaCX customer Xitong Zou told CoinDesk.  Tensions  between different classes of creditors are a timeless theme in distressed financial situations, but the QuadrigaCX case adds a distinctly modern twist: while the $50 million of fiat in question has largely been held up at third parties, the roughly $140 million worth of crypto is, for all intents and purposes, missing.  Stepping back, QuadrigaCX announced in mid-January that founder and CEO Gerald Cotten had died the month before. Last week, the company said in court filings that Cotten was the only member of the Quadriga team to manage its private keys, meaning the exchange could not locate $137 million in crypto stored offline in cold storage.  To give itself some breathing room and fend off customer lawsuits, the exchange successfully filed for creditor protection under the Canadian Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA). Now the company has roughly a month to try and sort out what assets it has before reappearing in court for a progress hearing.  Customers are not taking the news well. Many have turned to social media to call for criminal investigations of the exchange to try to determine whether their crypto holdings are truly frozen or potentially stolen.  And they've started to stake claims about who should be first in line to get paid back, in forums such as an unofficial Telegram channel.  Zou explained that he and other customers are waiting to receive completed fiat withdrawals, meaning they received emails from the exchange saying their funds had been sent to payment processors. Their refunds should be prioritized because ""from a legal standpoint you could argue that this money is not even Quadriga's from that point, and that we could be seen as trustees rather than creditors,"" he said.  On the other hand, acknowledging that the majority of creditors appear to be cryptocurrency holders, Zou added:  ""Of course people who hold more crypto ... will end up getting less if this happens, so I don't see this happening.""  A question of fairness  So far, there don't appear to be any crypto holders making a counterargument that they should be treated on an equal footing with the fiat creditors. The closest thing to a rebuttal to arguments like Zou's has been insults and name-calling in the chats.  But Elvis Cavalic, another QuadrigaCX customer whose funds were held in fiat, not crypto, told CoinDesk he does not think his class should get prioritized.  ""If there was a major divide and a legal precedent for preferential treatment towards fiat holders, I'm not going to lie I'd be more than happy to recover my losses but is that fair? No not at all,"" he added in an email.  In contrast, a third customer who wished to remain anonymous, citing fears of being attacked for his views, told CoinDesk that he believed fiat holders should not have to share their recovered funds with crypto holders.  ""I don't care what value bitcoin is for someone else, my Canadian dollars [don't] = [some] amount of bitcoin,"" said this person, who showed CoinDesk a log of his transactions at QuadrigaCX. ""What happens if they find the cold wallets and the value of bitcoin apparently tripled since, are my fellow crypto investors going to share their 300 [percent] profit with me although I only had fiat? What happens if they find the cold wallets and the value of bitcoin went down. I am going to pay for other people's bad investment?""  Citing the common saying ""not your keys, not your coins,"" the user said he personally would not hold any cryptocurrencies on an exchange, adding:  ""I have absolutely no reason to pay for other people's stupidity.""  The customer said he is currently looking to organize a class action lawsuit specifically for fiat holders, to be filed once Quadriga's stay of proceedings expires.  ""I'm not expecting a full refund,"" he said. ""What I'm expecting is that I'm not sharing my CAD with crypto holders.""  But Cavalic argued the situation was ""simple"": given that every customer who used the platform trusted it to some extent by storing funds in either form on Quadriga, they are essentially in the same boat because they were all caught off guard when it announced it was filing for creditor protection.  Lawsuits ahead?  So far, Zou has filed an affidavit with the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, calling for one law firm – Bennett Jones – to be appointed as representative counsel for a possible class action. Other customers have reached out to different firms, including Miller Thompson, Osler Hoskin and Harcourt and Gowlings as possible counsel.  The court has not yet designated any particular firm as representative counsel, but a hearing will be held on Feb. 14 to discuss the issue.  Christine Duhaime, a financial crimes lawyer and a partner with Duhaime Law, told CoinDesk that the firm that does get appointed as representative counsel would conduct preparatory work on building a case against Quadriga, though no lawsuit can be filed during the stay of proceedings. The firm would also be paid to find the different affected parties, alongside address information for these individuals.  She further told CoinDesk that she believes there should be two different counsels appointed – one focused on contacting customers and communicating with court-appointed monitor Ernst and Young, and one focused on the litigation itself.  As of Feb. 5, Bennett Jones had petitioned to be appointed representative counsel alongside McInnes Cooper, another firm which ""has significant experience in complex CCAA matters,"" according to an affidavit filed by Zou.  Still, there remains the question of what customers will actually receive.  Cavalic believes the majority of creditors are expecting the legal system to reimburse them for their losses, including their crypto holdings.  Zou was less hopeful that creditors would receive a full refund, though, noting that the exchange's reported assets were far outweighed by the reported debt; that legal fees and other administrative costs might cut into the amount ultimately sent out to each individual; and that it will likely take years to resolve the matter.  ""I anticipate them extending the stay as well,"" he said.  Speaking more broadly, he said creditors have not been positive about the situation, saying:  ""That's been the general sentiment so far – lots of [anger], bitterness, and most likely seeing pennies on the dollar after waiting a while.""

In an announcement Friday, the island nation's Financial Services Commission (FSC) said that, after publishing draft rules in a consultation paper in November 2018, the framework has now been finalized and will come into effect on March 1.  In effect, the framework sets out the rules for a licence that allows the holder to provide custody services for digital assets. The move makes the Mauritius the ""first jurisdiction globally to offer a regulated landscape for the custody of digital assets,"" according to the FSC.  Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, prime minister of the Republic of Mauritius stated:  “In revolutionising the global FinTech ecosystem through this regulatory framework for the custody of Digital Assets, my Government reiterates its commitment to accelerating the country’s move to an age of digitally-enabled economic growth.  While the final framework will be published in full in the upcoming Government Gazette on March 1, the announcement indicates that holders of the digital asset licence will be mandated to comply with the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism funding rules ""in line with international best practices.""  Although likely changed in some aspects in its final form, the November consultation paper lists a series of stipulations for licensees, including statutory reporting and disclosures to clients, a minimum of reserve assets and ""comprehensive"" program for risk management.  Custodians would also have to follow guidelines for storage of digital asset keys and seeds, demonstrate security procedures for onsite cold storage of assets and have in place a system for detection and reporting of suspicious transactions, as per the draft.  The FSC added in today's announcement that it has engaged with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development on the governance and regulation of digital assets and that the effort guided development of the new licencing rules.  The process has also been ""collaborative across industry stakeholders, policymakers and the regulator,"" Loretta Joseph, regulatory consultant to the FSC, told CoinDesk.  ""This regulatory framework reiterates the stance taken over the last year to be a forward thinking and innovative nation that can lead appropriate and sensible regulation for the region,"" Joseph said.

42387638,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQlwYt,1549634427,SEC Commissioner Says Bitcoin ETF Will Be Approved 'Eventually',"A commissioner at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) believes a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will ultimately be approved.  Robert J. Jackson Jr., in an interview published by government-focused news source Roll Call on Wednesday, said:  “Eventually, do I think someone will satisfy the standards that we’ve laid out there? I hope so, yes, and I think so.”  A number of bitcoin ETF proposals have filed for SEC approval, but none has yet got the green light.  Jay Clayton, chairman of the SEC) has said he doesn’t see a pathway to a cryptocurrency ETF approval until concerns over market manipulation are addressed.  The SEC has to date rejected at least 10 such proposals. Last August, it turned down seven filings from ProShares, Direxion and GraniteShares. A day later, though, the regulator said it would review the proposals.  In July, the SEC for the second time rejected Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss’ proposal to list a bitcoin ETF on the Bats BZX Exchange.  Discussing the Winklevoss’ proposal with Roll Call, Jackson said it was “not a difficult case,” but the risk of manipulation and harm to investors was ""enormous,"" while the market has a ""very serious” liquidity problem.  He continued:  ""I’m happy to say market participants have begun to come in with ideas. Whether or not we’re going to find one that really protects investors I don’t know, but I do know that that [Winklevoss] case wasn’t especially close.""  Another SEC commissioner has been even more pragmatic over the possibility of a bitcoin ETF. Back in July, Hester Peirce said that the Winklevoss' proposed rule change ""satisfies the statutory standard and that we should permit BZX to list and trade this bitcoin-based exchange-traded product (‘ETP’).”  “From my perspective, we need to be mindful of what our role is, and it’s not to be the ones who decide which innovations and which technologies get through and which ones don’t,” Peirce told CoinDesk soon after.  Today, Peirce tweeted that she looks forward to working with Jackson “to open the doors to innovation.”  The SEC’s rejections have clearly not deterred all from trying to make the ETF breakthrough.  Last month, due to the U.S. government shutdown, Cbeo withdrew its proposed rule change that, if approved, would clear the way for a bitcoin ETF backed by VanEck and SolidX. Days later it refiled.  Also in January, Bitwise Asset Management announced its plan to launch a bitcoin ETF.  R. J.

According to Reuters, the British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) spokesman Brian Kladko said Thursday that, as Vancouver, B.C.-based QuadrigaCX was not trading in securities or derivatives, the exchange does not come under its purview.  The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) also told Reuters: “No crypto-asset trading platform had been regulated as a marketplace by Canadian securities regulators.” The CSA is a collective forum comprising the regional securities regulators of Canada.  Possibly as much as $190 million in both cryptocurrency and fiat owned by QuadrigaCX users have been unreachable since the firm's founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten, died in December, leaving no a way for staff to access the computer apparently storing its funds.  Cotten’s death has been at the center of concerns and theories about the state of the exchange and the sequence of events leading up to the current situation.  The exchange has since sought creditor protection in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court as it seeks to find a way to refund users and access the locked funds. On Tuesday, a judge from the court granted the exchange its application, giving it a 30-day stay of proceedings to try and resolve the situation for users.

42381535,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9n4ad,1549623603,Bitcoin Price Still Trading Flat While Litecoin Hits 7-Month High,"View  The immediate outlook for bitcoin will remain bearish while prices are held below the 6-hour chart 50-candle moving average, currently at $3,417.  Litecoin's BTC-denominated exchange rate (LTC/BTC) clocked seven-month highs earlier today. A close above 0.010182 BTC would confirm an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout and open up upside toward 0.013 BTC. The rally, however, may not happen immediately, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is reporting overbought conditions.  LTC's bullish setup would be invalidated if prices fall back below 0.010182 BTC. That looks unlikely, though, given the bullish long-term moving averages.  Bitcoin (BTC), which continues to languish near seven-week lows, is being outshone by a surge in litecoin prices.  BTC, the world's leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently trading at $3,390 on Bistamp and risks falling to December lows near $3,100, having charted bearish higher low at the crucial 6-hour chart 50-candle moving average (MA) this week.  Meanwhile, litecoin, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is currently changing hands at $37.70 – a 12.7 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. LTC’s BTC-denominated exchange rate jumped to 0.011404 BTC on Binance earlier today marking the highest level since July 21, 2018.  The rally looks sustainable, too, as trading volumes across exchanges have increased by 34 percent to $879 million in the last 24 hours.  While the exact reason for double-digit gains is not clear, the cryptocurrency may have picked up a strong bid in reaction to the news that the Litecoin Foundation is in talks to implement privacy features for litecoin via the Mimblewimble protocol.  So far, litecoin’s double-digit jump has not had a positive rub off on the broader market, and the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are still trading flat or with minor gains.  The broader market sentiment, however, may improve if BTC responds to LTC rally by climbing the crucial resistance of the 6-hour chart 50-candle moving average (MA), currently located at $3,417. That would boost the odds of a corrective bounce toward the resistance at $3,658.  LTC/BTC daily chart  On the daily chart, LTC/BTC is trading well above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline level of 0.010182 BTC. A bull breakout would be confirmed if prices close today above that level.  The inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern works best when it appears at the bottom of the sell-off, as is the case with LTC/BTC currently.  Therefore, a breakout, if confirmed, could yield a rally to 0.0134 BTC (target as per the measured move method) – albeit after a minor bout of consolidation, as the 14-day relative strength index is reporting overbought conditions.  LTC/BTC weekly chart  As seen above, the 5- and 10-week moving averages (MAs) are trending north, indicating a bullish setup. Further, the 14-week RSI is reporting bullish conditions with an above-50 reading. So, the probability of LTC confirming an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout is high.

Announcing the news on Thursday, the firm said that the new Hong Kong-based venture – Ortus – is a “block deal, matchmaking service” for institutional clients. In an OTC deal, two parties trade directly with each other, unlike on an exchange where orders are matched between buyers and sellers.  “Ortus will operate to allow institutions to buy and sell digital assets through a network of global liquidity providers and benefit from a competitive and best price execution service,” said Rahul Khanna, Bithumb’s director.  According to its website, Ortus has offices in the U.K., Hong Kong, Japan, Australia and Argentina.  To get started, clients will have to go through “strict” onboarding processes, including know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) documentation, the firm said.  Ortus offers features such as insured custody and transfers from a U.S.-based bank account. The firm did not set out which digital assets it will offer for OTC trades.  Several crypto exchanges have launched OTC trading desks in recent months to capitalize on growing interest from institutions.  Just last month, U.S.-based Bittrex launched an OTC desk supporting nearly 200 cryptocurrencies. In December 2018, Poloniex opened OTC trading service for institutional clients with a minimum order size of $250,000.  And a month prior, crypto exchange unicorn Coinbase also opened an OTC service for its Prime customers – that is, financial institutions looking to trade with business funds.

Fundsquare, the fund distribution arm of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the project's technical partner, announced the news on its blog Thursday, saying Credit Suisse Asset Management and Portugal-based bank Banco Best have “successfully processed live end-to-end fund transactions” using blockchain technology.  For the trial, the firms used the FundsDLT platform, developed in a partnership with professional services firm KPMG and software provider InTech, for cross-border distribution of an investment fund. Banco Best developed an API integration and created a custom app for the effort.  The test enabled the participants to achieve “more efficient, scalable, and timely” cross-border transactions, “from delivery of the order to the processing of the trade,” Fundsquare said.  “With the successful completion of real, live transactions, we were able to prove that considerable benefits can be achieved with distributed ledger technology for both clients and asset managers,” said Credit Suisse Asset Management’s chief digital officer Pascal Nägeli.  Other asset management firms have been exploring the same use case for blockchain tech. Back in December, Calastone, operator of a London-based transaction network for investment funds, said it was looking to move its entire settlements system to a blockchain by May 2019.  In December 2017, U.S. mutual funds manager Vanguard said it will begin using smart contracts over a private blockchain for some of its business operations soon.

42381519,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9n4J1,1549612813,Latest Lightning Code Release Trolls With a 'Block Size' Increase,"The latest code version for the lightning network – often trumpeted as the future of bitcoin payments – includes a ""block size increase.""  One of the most active lightning implementations, LND, pushed out its newest ""minor"" release, version 0.5.2, of its beta code on Wednesday. Though it includes several changes from many contributors, mostly with the goal of making the still-experimental payment system easier for end-users, the feature that's sure to stick out to bitcoin veterans a “block size increase,” bringing to mind the parameter that the bitcoin community went to war over a couple years back.  But don’t worry: all hell isn’t about to break loose, as the feature is not really related.  “It’s for the command line tool to be able to get a snapshot of the network. Thought I’d troll with the title lol,“ Lightning Labs developer Olaoluwa Osuntokun told CoinDesk.  Each node on the network stores a ""graph"" of its view of other lightning nodes on the network. That's so that when a user sends a payment to someone else, the node can determine the best route to go through to reach its destination.  However, the graph has been ballooning as more people test out the lightning network, so developers have been brushing up against the limits. Thus, the team increased the ""block size"" of the graph, from 4MB to 50MB, so that developers can grab a larger snapshot.  ""With this commit, we give ourselves some breathing room,"" the release notes explain.  Others following developments aren't missing the block size connection either, responding by parroting talking points often made in the debate. On the GitHub pull request for the block size change, one GitHub user wrote:  ""While we're increasing the block size, we should also re-enable some deprecated features and then call it gRPC Cash!"" he said, ridiculing the cryptocurrency bitcoin cash, which split off of bitcoin in the fire of debate in the summer of 2017, charting out its own technical vision.  Even with releases such as this, the lightning network is still experimental and considered risky to use as users might lose money if the software doesn't work as planned.  As such, the release also lays the groundwork for much-anticipated lightning changes for making it easier to use, such as Atomic Multi-Path Payments (AMP), a way to combine funds from many lightning channels into one payment, and ""neutrino"" light wallet support, which would allow users to use the payment system with less data.  0.5.2 is a ""miner"" release, meaning it mostly includes bug fixes and other small optimizations, which differs from a ""major"" release, where new features are released.

In the order, filed in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York on Thursday, Judge Jed S. Rakoff ruled Shrem should be reimbursed for a prior court ruling that gave the plaintiffs the ability to seize up to $30 million worth of his assets.  The initial order was rolled back on November 8, at which point Shrem filed a motion to recoup attorney's fees and related costs to defending the motion.  Lawyers for Winklevoss Capital had attempted to argue Shrem should not recoup the funds for his costs, as he was only ultimately only charged a ""de minimis amount"" of less than $5. The court, however, ultimately rejected the idea this invalidated Shrem's claim, though the judge found the requested damages should be reduced by 40 percent on reviewing the charges.  Brian Klein, partner at Baker Marquart LLP, said of the ruling:  ""We are glad that the judge ruled for Charlie and ordered WCF to reimburse him for legal fees he incurred in overturning WCF’s approximately $30 million attachment order. This is another big step towards his full vindication.""  Overall, the court filing is the latest in a recent lawsuit that has pitted three high-profile cryptocurrency industry personalities and former business partners against each other in the headlines.  Winklevoss Capital was previously an investor in Shrem's first startup BitInstant, an early cryptocurrency exchange that was one of the most public before its eventual shut down in 2013. Shrem was later found to have violated anti-money laundering rules during his tenure as CEO, for which he would ultimately serve a one-year prison sentence.
