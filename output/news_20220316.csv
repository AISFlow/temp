The miner said it is ""continuously evaluating strategic opportunities,"" which it may decide to undertake as part of its strategic growth initiatives, company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on Tuesday.  The miner reported 2021 revenue of $213.2 million, which is up 1,665% from 2020 and beat average analyst estimates of $211.06 million, according to FactSet data.  A rise in the company's hashrate and bitcoin price helped the company's revenue in 2021, the miner said.  The company reported a net loss of $7.9 million in 2021, versus a net loss of $12.7 million in 2020. The net loss for the fiscal year 2021 was significantly impacted by non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of $68.5 million and a non-cash, unrealized loss of $36.5 million on impairment of cryptocurrencies, according to a statement.  Riot also increased the bitcoin held on the balance sheet by 353% in 2021, compared to 1,078 in 2020. On March 3, the miner said it held about 5,783 self-mined bitcoins as of end of February.  Furthermore, the miner reiterated its expectations of reaching a 2022 hashrate of 12.8 exahash per second (EH/s). By comparison, its peer Marathon Digital said it expects to reach a hashrate of 23.3 EH/s by early 2023.  Riot shares rose slightly in post-market trading, while bitcoin hovered above $40,000, according to TradingView data.

42435253,wOc5H8d0GcW5NDeNpBvCek,1647469882,First Mover Asia: India Crypto Investors Await Taxation Clarity; Bitcoin Rises on a Day of Big Price Swings,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin went on a roller-coaster ride but also rose above $41,000.  Insights: India's crypto community awaits a finance bill that will clarify the government's approach to crypto taxation.  Technician's take: BTC pared earlier losses; support at $37K and resistance at $45K.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $41,609 +3.8%  Ether (ETH): $2,754 +6%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Chainlink LINK +6.8% Computing Polkadot DOT +6.5% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM +5.9% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Bitcoin rises on a day of price swings  Bitcoin was well into the green over the past 24 hours, although not before experiencing a roller-coaster ride of steep ascents and dips spurred by news events, including economic fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the widely expected decision by the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates.  The largest cryptocurrency by market cap had soared past the psychologically important threshold of $40,000 early Wednesday morning (UTC time) and then climbed past $41,000 over a roughly 90-minute period. The source of the quick spike remained unclear, although some market observers believe it was tied to China's pledge to support its real estate and tech industries, a move that calmed investors who have been abandoning stocks in droves after a regulatory crackdown and recent slowdown in the country's storied economic growth.  After dropping under $40,000 on two occasions during Asian and U.S. trading hours, bitcoin was changing hands again above $41,000, up about 4%. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was trading at nearly $2,800, a roughly 6% gain. Most other major altcoins had gained ground over the past 24 hours.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed into law a bill that legalizes crypto in the country. Ukraine has been using a flood of digital asset donations to support the country's defense against the Russian invasion. In an impassioned speech delivered virtually, Zelenskyy asked the U.S. Congress to provide more support and to strengthen sanctions against Russia. ""We need such principles of European business that the Russian state does not have the money to ruin lives,"" he said.  The Federal Reserve decided to raise interest rates by 25 basis points and indicated it would increase rates in similar increments six more times in 2022. The Fed has adopted a more hawkish stance to tame rising inflation but without sending the U.S. economy into recession.  Ben Emons, the managing director of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors, said crypto markets had largely already priced in the interest rate increase. ""It's a fair point to say that there's been anticipation in the affect of rate hikes,"" Emons told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" hosts, adding: ""As [for] the Fed signal it's ready to do this faster, that's not priced in.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,358 +2.2%  DJIA: 34,063 +1.5%  Nasdaq: 13,436 +3.7%  Gold: $1,946 -0.4%  Insights  India awaits crypto taxation clarity  India’s crypto community will likely have to wait till next week to receive clarity on new tax rules.  This after India’s Parliament websites did not mention the introduction of the finance bill that is expected to explain the government's crypto taxation policies. At least one source said the bill is unlikely to be introduced on the last working day of the week, Thursday. The week is shortened as Friday is a holiday celebrating Holi, one of India’s most significant festivals.  The delay gives India’s crypto community more time to mobilize and express themselves to the framers of the bill. Since the announcement of the proposed taxation, crypto supporters have been knocking on the doors of the finance ministry, holding informal and formal conversations urging them to make changes.  The current tax proposal includes a 30% tax on any income generated from crypto transactions and a second tax of 1% at source on all transactions (tax deducted at source, or TDS). Expectations are low that the government will roll back the 30% tax but the industry is hopeful the 1% TDS could be tweaked.  A change.org petition asking for a reduction in the 30% tax and the 1% TDS, among other demands, has already received around 100,000 signatures out of the 150,000 sought.  ***  Meanwhile, as the world is laser-focused on watching whether crypto is being used by Russia to avoid sanctions, Afghans are using crypto to avoid U.S. sanctions, according to BBChttps://ca.news.yahoo.com/afghans-turn-cryptocurrencies-amid-us-004916747.html.  ***  China looks to allay investors' fears  China’s top financial policy committee, the Financial Stability Development Committee of the State Council, promised to keep the market stable and support property and tech companies.  Following reports of the meeting in Chinese state media Wednesday, Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index, which had its biggest loss since 2018 on Monday, posted double digit gains in Wednesday afternoon trading.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Holds Above $40K; Resistance at $45K  Bitcoin (BTC) pared earlier losses and returned above $40,000 toward the end of the New York trading day. The cryptocurrency experienced wild price swings over the past few days, which typically occurs during times of low trading volume.  For now, support around $37,000-$40,000 remains intact, although resistance toward $45,000 could stall the upswing in price.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart continues to rise from an oversold reading on Jan. 21. Still, price jumps have been capped at resistance over the past two months, indicating persistent selling pressure.  On a positive note, BTC could see additional price gains if the daily RSI remains above 50, which could signal the end of the four-month long downtrend.

This would include data including physical addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, IDs, phone numbers, bank account numbers, passwords, bitcoin (BTC) addresses, bitcoin balances, loan balances, trading activity, vault statements and loan statements.  Kelly added that while client bitcoin custody is protected by multisig cold storage, clients nevertheless should be aware of what happened and be vigilant against phishing attacks.

The project’s official Twitter handle highlighted the “ApeCoin” drop late Wednesday.  An accompanying press release took great pains to distance ApeDAO’s token launch from the Bored Ape Yacht Club, presumably for legal reasons. Club-style NFTs with perks for long-term members can start to resemble investment contracts, which, in the U.S., are overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). NFTs, at least so far, are not.  Yuga Labs plans to “adopt ApeCoin as the primary token for all new products and services,” but press materials insist that ApeCoin is really only the product of a new organizational unit called ApeCoin DAO.  The token will be owned and operated by ApeCoin DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that gives token holders governance rights over the DAO’s “Ecosystem Fund.” Holding ApeCoin is the only membership requirement for the DAO, according to the Twitter thread.  Web 3 celebs including investor Alexis Ohanian have said they’d be on the council initially overseeing the token’s governance.  According to the ApeCoin Twitter account, 62% of the token’s total supply will be allocated to the ApeCoin community, with 15% being available to claim in an airdrop on March 17.

42410903,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtFxu,1647466155,Juno's Proposal 16 Vote Is a Watershed for Blockchain Governance – For Better or Worse,"For perhaps the first time, a blockchain community has formally voted to confiscate a user’s funds.  Proposal 16, a governance proposal on the Cosmos-based Juno blockchain, has passed via the chain’s token-voting governance system. The proposal signals community approval to cut the balance of JUNO tokens held by a “whale,” or large holder, accused of manipulating the Juno launch airdrop enacted in October. The plan is extremely notable because it appears to mark the first major instance of on-chain governance being used to change a user’s token balance.  The vote initially seemed likely to pass with a strong majority because it was widely seen as correcting something akin to a theft. But in recent days a variety of stakers and developers have publicly signaled their opposition out of concern such a move would undermine the perceived rules-based trustworthiness of the system, or its “immutability.”  The whale accused of manipulating the airdrop (a kind of crypto giveaway), meanwhile, represented itself as an investment group rather than an individual in statements defending its behavior ahead of the vote. In part, the whale argued the wallet splitting that appeared to be “gaming” the airdrop was in fact intended to serve its clients. The whale stated it considered the airdropped funds to rightfully belong to those clients. Those claims were met with significant skepticism, but may have influenced some to vote against the proposal.  The Proposal 16 vote by Juno holders was ultimately very close. The final vote tally was 40.85% Yes, 33.76% No, 3.59% No with Veto, and 21.79% Abstain. (“No With Veto” is a voting option on Cosmos systems that signals belief the proposal itself is harmful and can result in penalties for the proposer.)  The closeness of the vote is likely to heighten tension as the Juno community moves to implement the edict, much as an official elected by a slim margin lacks a “mandate to govern.” This is an issue because, first, Prop. 16 was what’s sometimes referred to as a “signaling proposal,” and a subsequent proposal will be needed to outline the specific implementation of the decision. (The Juno whale’s tokens are currently locked and should not be able to move to dodge the haircut.)  That implementation will not be frictionless. Different on-chain governance systems allow different parameters to be changed automatically via vote. Juno, and most similar systems based on Tendermint open-source software, allow automated changes of system parameters for future issuance, but not alteration of current balances.  The hard thing about hard forks  Instead, implementing Proposal 16 would require a hard fork, or backward-incompatible code change, to Juno. That would involve taking a “snapshot” of the chain’s state (how many tokens each address owned at a point of time), altering the whale’s balance and restarting the chain. This is essentially the same process that followed the huge 2016 hack of The DAO on Ethereum, though that fork was spearheaded by Ethereum’s founders, with no on-chain process.  “If someone [hypothetically] passed a signaling proposal that said all coins must move to some wallet, by coercing everyone to support it on-chain … [u]nless validators willingly coordinate on the hard fork, it still won’t happen,” according to Tor Bair, founder of the Cosmos-based privacy network Secret.  There is an added complication to doing a hard fork rather than an automated parameter change. Validators, the equivalent of Bitcoin’s miners on Cosmos and other proof-of-stake systems, could choose to continue monitoring transactions for the original chain, as with any blockchain hard fork. But there would likely be few users remaining on that chain, particularly after the fork of a relatively small project like Juno, making the choice to continue the original chain financially risky for validators.  Finally, the vote may have highlighted a possible governance-based attack vector that hadn’t been widely considered. The rules for the Juno airdrop were first published in August, but according to archived versions of the page a provision limiting the airdrop to one instance “per person or entity” was added at an unknown subsequent date.  That clause has been used to rally support for Proposal 16 because it would mean the airdrop gamer violated not just the spirit of the process, but the bright-line letter of the rules. Yet, depending on when the “person or entity” clause was added, the argument begins to seem misleading.  The complexity of all this, though, may distract from a fundamental truth of blockchain systems. On-chain voting systems may provide a layer of communication, coordination and formality, but ultimately the mechanism for making really big changes remains essentially the same. When a cadre of dissident bitcoiners cloned Bitcoin and increased the block size to create Bitcoin Cash, they were essentially voting with their feet. Few blockchain systems have effective means of preventing such forks, whether they’re used to shift an operating parameter, or to take away someone’s money.  “There is always a risk of immutability,” says Bair. “It’s a hard fork, at the end of the day.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | AIRDROP | FORKS,David Z.

42435254,wOc5H8d0GcW5NDeNpBvCzK,1647462961,Market Wrap: Cryptos Recover From Drop After Fed Rate Hike; Expect Higher Volatility,"Most cryptocurrencies traded higher over the past 24 hours, albeit with large price swings after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 2018.  The Fed also boosted its inflation forecasts and signaled plans to raise interest rates in similar increments six more times this year. Low rates and central bank stimulus have contributed to rallies across speculative assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin (BTC) fell about 3% immediately following the Fed announcement, but quickly pared losses toward the end of the New York trading day. Similar price moves were seen in the S&P 500, while Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar pared earlier gains.  The central bank also announced that it will reduce its balance sheet of bond holdings ""at a coming meeting,"" not specifying whether it will happen at the next meeting in May. Over time, analysts expect higher volatility and lower market returns as a result of tighter monetary policy.  Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy legalized crypto in the country. The law determines the legal status, classification, ownership and regulators of virtual assets. Ukraine has received at least $100 million in crypto donations over the past three weeks from people who want to support its defense and help fund humanitarian efforts.  In crypto markets, many alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) outperformed on Wednesday, suggesting a greater appetite for risk among traders. Chainlink's LINK was up 5% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 10% rise in SAND and a 2% gain in BTC.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $40,771, +2.41%    ●Ether (ETH): $2,741, +2.93%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,358, +2.24%    ●Gold: $1,927 per troy ounce, −0.07%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.19%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  The chart below shows elevated BTC implied volatility versus realized volatility, which means bitcoin traders have positioned themselves for an increase in price swings over the past week.  Lately, there has been large demand for longer-dated options toward June-December, coupled with increased activity in ETH put options, according to QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto trading firm. QCP expects BTC's volatility curve to steepen after the Fed decision as traders discount short-term price price swings.  The options market has placed a 52% probability that BTC will trade above $38,000 in April, according to Skew data.  Bitcoin correlations  Bitcoin's 90-day correlation with the overall crypto market is near all-time highs, which makes it difficult for investors who want to diversify across tokens.  Generally, altcoins outperform during bull markets because they have a greater risk profile relative to bitcoin. And during down markets, bitcoin outperforms as investors reduce their exposure to risk. So, when correlations are high, there is less opportunity to reduce volatility in a crypto portfolio, which is why some traders have remained on the sidelines.  Rising correlations ""paint a picture of an overall risk-averse sentiment in the market,"" Arcane Research wrote in a recent report. ""In the summer of 2020, the correlation was headed downwards, caused by bitcoin's strength compared to altcoins. The correlation bottomed in Jan. 2021, before it grew as altcoins began moving more inline with bitcoin.""  Since cryptos have moved in the same direction over the past year, there is less desire among traders to rotate into altcoins, according to Arcane Research. That could enhance bitcoin's outperformance relative to altcoins.  Altcoin roundup  GRT post rally: GRT, the primary token on the Graph ecosystem, is up 23% over the past week due to the continuing subgraph migration from Ethereum to the Graph's mainnet.

Buyers could drive the coin back to $2.1 as prices bottom up after a 65 percent dump from 2021 peaks. Past Performance of Fantom (FTM) There could be elements of strength when writing, but FTM prices are down over 65 percent from peaks. When writing, FTM is down 14 percent on the last trading week versus the USDT, but gains of March 15 appear to be changing the fortune for Fantom holders. In the previous 24 hours, the coin is up 14 percent, rising from around the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the July to October 2021 trade range. Fantom Technical Analysis The FTM price is within a bear breakout pattern following losses below $1.30 in early March 2022. The recovery from $1—a round number—and 2022 lows could signal strength in the short term. Thus far, the rejection of lower lows and FTM prices trending inside the bullish engulfing pattern of March 15 points to strength. Accordingly, aggressive traders may find entries on pullbacks within the March 15 bull bar with immediate targets at $1.3 and $2.1 in the medium term. On the reverse side, sharp losses below $1 confirm sellers from mid-January 2022. In that eventuality, FTM may dump to May 2021 highs of $0.85 in a retest. What to Expect of Fantom?

However, the size of the candles and the trading volumes by which sellers implement their initiative speak of their complete depletion.

42435250,wOc5H8d0GcW5NDeNpBvCjt,1647454312,Fed Raises Benchmark Interest Rate by 25 Basis Points,"In a widely telegraphed and anticipated move, the U.S. Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it will lift the fed-funds rate by a quarter-percentage point to a range of 0.25%-0.5% from the current rate of close to zero. This is the first time since December 2018 that the central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate.  ""Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices and broader price pressures,"" the Fed said in a statement. ""The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.""  The Fed also announced that it will reduce its balance sheet ""at a coming meeting."" It didn't specify whether that will happen at its next meeting in May.  The interest rate hike, approved by the Federal Open Market Committee, comes after the widely tracked consumer price index (CPI) accelerated to a four-decade high of 7.9% in February, with many economists predicting inflation still hasn't peaked yet. On Tuesday, the U.S. Labor Department reported that the producer price index (PPI) rose 10% in February to an all-time high.  Crypto traders were closely watching the Fed's policy statement. The prospect of what could be a prolonged series of rate hikes or balance sheet reductions or both has been a headwind for digital asset prices, particularly for the price of bitcoin (BTC).  “I'd say that the market is not going to react to the rate hike but will likely react very sharply to anything said in the statement or more likely, the press conference, that indicates a change in the quantitative easing exit schedule or the start of quantitative tightening,“ Bob Iaccino, chief strategist at Path Trading Partners and co-portfolio manager at Stock Think Tank, said before the Fed made its announcement.  “Equity markets do not tend to suffer all that often or all that much, during rate-hike cycles, [and] since the bitcoin/Nasdaq correlation is still holding very strong, I would expect the same thing for cryptocurrencies in general,” Iaccino said.  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading below $40,000 after the decision was announced, still within range of swings that occurred during Asian trading hours.  Traders were likely watching whether the Fed's comments would be “dovish” or “hawkish,” two terms used to describe an either cautious or more aggressive path ahead by the Fed. The CME FedWatch Tool shows that traders are split evenly over whether the central bank will go with a 25- or a 50-basis point increase at its meeting in May, which could bring the rate to as high as 1%.  Alongside Wednesday's policy decision and statement, the Fed also released its quarterly economic projections and its “dot plot” showing expectations for the fed-funds rate, which is the overnight lending rate between banks.  The median expectation is now for seven 25-basis point hikes for 2022, which would bring the fund's rate up to 2.8%. That is about 100 basis points higher than what was expected three months ago.  Committee members are also predicting much slower gross domestic product growth for 2022 that what they predicted before. They now see 2.8% growth, down from the 4% growth they estimated in December.  UPDATE (Mar. 16, 18:26 UTC): Added information about GDP projections.

42411486,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOO2W,1647452140,A 'Petroyuan' Could Further Shake the Dollar's Dominance,"In the latest sign the dollar-centric global financial system is under immense strain, China and Saudi Arabia have “accelerated” ongoing talks to price oil contracts in yuan instead of greenbacks, according to a Wall Street Journal report.  The dollar’s ongoing steady decline as a global trading and reserve instrument has significant implications for the U.S. economy, and could make neutral or non-state monetary networks more useful to a wider range of actors.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in crypto. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Crucially, the “petroyuan” talks were not triggered by events in Ukraine, but have been ongoing for six years. They have been accelerated not by Russia’s invasion, according to the Journal, but by U.S. Middle East policy in recent months. That includes the military withdrawal from Afghanistan and a White House more assertively critical of the allegedly Saudi-planned murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  U.S. support for the regional political agendas of OPEC nations was key to the arrangement that standardized the dollar pricing of oil in the 1970s, so hints of a pullback shouldn’t be surprising. The U.S. is also consuming only one-quarter as much Middle Eastern oil as it was when the petrodollar system was established, while Chinese imports have grown. In many respects, that’s for the good – Saudi Arabia is a brutally repressive monarchy, hardly less politically toxic than Vladimir Putin’s Russia, and the U.S. willingness to step back from a dangerously cozy relationship there is good for the world.  But the ongoing shift creates a fundamental structural problem. The dollar-denomination of OPEC oil sales plays a huge role in unifying global markets around a common currency. If the U.S. itself has looser ties to OPEC, both this powerful dollar-trade node and the broader dollar network will almost inevitably begin to splinter and unravel.  The news follows unprecedented sanctions against Russia, including the freezing of central bank reserves, and the seizure of U.S.-held central bank funds from Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.  Read more: America's Quiet Default  These measures are a clear warning to other dissenters or rivals to the U.S.-Europe power nexus that they can’t rely on the good faith of Western banking authorities. That doesn’t necessarily mean the yuan is suddenly a superior instrument – it has serious problems of its own. But the dramatic erosion of the dollar’s immutability certainly makes any dollar alternative that much more appealing.  There have been rapid assurances that the Saudi threat is merely a strategic feint against the U.S., or that a small petroyuan trade would not be a threat to dollar dominance.  This is true in the sense that the first thousand gallons of water taken on by the Titanic didn’t sink it. What matters isn’t the water but the holes letting it through the hull of the U.S.S. Dollar. Until those weaknesses and pressures change, every pinprick makes the dollar's fate less certain.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

42410907,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtFub,1647447745,Russian Crypto Miners Brace for Sanctions Fallout Amid Ukraine Conflict,"Crypto miners in Russia have been unscathed so far by the war in Ukraine, but sanctions could soon indirectly squeeze their businesses.  Last August, Russia was the world’s third-biggest bitcoin (BTC) mining country after the U.S. and Kazakhstan, according to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance’s Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. Mines are mostly located in remote parts of Siberia, some around 3,700 miles away from Kyiv, and so they haven’t seen any serious interruptions to their operations. By contrast, earlier this year in Kazakhstan, another former Soviet state, civil unrest led to internet shutdowns that disrupted the operations of crypto mines for a few days.  Mining remains a “sustainable business” in Russia despite the conflict, said Sergey Arestov, co-founder of Russian mining hosting firm BitCluster. He pointed to the supply of relatively inexpensive energy and construction materials as well as to the weak ruble. As a result of the local currency’s fall, bitcoin is worth more in rubles, and so “mining has become even more profitable,” Arestov said.  Further, the ruble’s decline has made local energy cheaper by global standards, said Denis Rusinovich, co-founder of Berlin-based Cryptocurrency Mining Group (CMG) and Switzerland-based miner Maveric Group. Electricity tariffs in Russia dropped 25%-30% in U.S. dollar-denominated terms, he said, a few days into the conflict.  The global bitcoin hashrate, a measure of computing power on the network, has been unchanged three weeks into the war, which Russian President Vladimir Putin calls a “special military operation.”  On top of the conflict itself, however, Russia has become the world’s most sanctioned country, with banking restrictions, export and import bans and the freezing of assets owned by some of Russia’s richest and most powerful people.  “We definitely will not see any investments in new sites or hosting for bitcoin mining in the region from anyone outside Russia,” Rusinovich said. That once again raises concern over the centralization of the network and the ever-diminishing range of options for geographic diversification of computing power, he said.  Driven away by sanctions  At least two Europe-based miners interviewed by CoinDesk have abandoned plans to expand operations in Russia. Rusinovich said he has given up on projects in Russia in light of the current situation.  “We don’t plan to look for new sites in Russia, but we are developing more than 300 megawatts in the next six to eight months,” Roman Zabuga, a spokesman for BWC UG, a Germany-based mining hosting firm, told CoinDesk. BWC UG will likely host Chinese miners from Kazakhstan once the firm’s mines are complete, he said.  BitCluster, which also hosts mining rigs for other firms, will reorient itself from Western Europe and North America to the east when looking for investors and clients, Arestov said. The Middle East, Central Asia, India and Africa are huge markets, he said.  The decisions of some European and U.S. miners to pivot away from Russia won’t severely disrupt the crypto mining industry, said David Carlisle, director of policy and regulatory affairs at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.  Switzerland-based BitRiver, which is one of the largest mining players in Russia, declined to comment for this story.  Those who stay in Russia “might face a shortage of spare parts and difficulties with logistics” because of the sanctions, Arestov said.  But specialized chips for crypto mining, known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), can still be purchased from China, Carlisle said. The major manufacturers of ASICs remain in China, which hasn’t placed any sanctions on Russia.

The restrictions and logistics difficulties regarding equipment procurement will lead to a slight uptick in mining hardware demand inside Russia, as it could also be seen as an investment protected by soaring inflation, Rusinovich said.  Regulatory uncertainty  Prior to the conflict, Russia was brewing what was likely to be its biggest regulatory step in crypto trading and mining yet.  About a week before the war started, the Russian Ministry of Finance submitted a bill that would regulate crypto trading and mining to the parliament. The press release announcing the bill gave few details about how mining would be regulated, only mentioning that dedicated government agencies would be responsible for the industry.  There is uncertainty about how the new legislation will treat mining, as well as how Russia’s capital controls will be implemented on crypto.  The central bank ordered exporters to convert 80% of their foreign currency deposited to their bank accounts under cross-border traded contracts into rubles. A similar logic could be applied to bitcoin as it is a convertible digital hard currency, Rusinovich said.  One Russian miner said that he expects regulation to be introduced quickly to deal with the federal budget deficit and capital flight.  The regulation might turn out to be a ban on cryptocurrency activities, with higher electricity tariffs for miners (similar to what China has done), instead of a tax rebate, as previously hoped, this miner said.  Read more: China's Zhejiang Province Implements Punitive Electricity Prices for Crypto Mining  By contrast, Elliptic’s Carslile thinks the Kremlin may suddenly see mining as a much-needed source of cash flow: “A key question is whether the Russian government may look to mining as a way to generate revenue in the face of sanctions – either by directly getting involved in mining, or by seeking to license and tax it,” he said.  Considering that sanctions are now specifically targeting Russia's oil and gas industries, it is “increasingly likely that Russia could turn to mining.” State-owned Russian natural gas giant Gazpromneft is among the firms that has been engaged in mining itself.

Luno's parent company, Digital Currency Group, is also the parent of CoinDesk.  Luno Expeditions will focus on early-stage investing (seed and pre-seed) with the aim of making 200-300 such investments per year.  The division will spearhead all the early-stage investments of Digital Currency Group.  ""Practically speaking, we expect to invest a range of $15 million to $75 million per year,"" Luno Expeditions CEO Jocelyn Cheng told CoinDesk.  Luno plans to invest $50,000 to $250,000 per company with flexibility for this figure to grow, she added.  Luno, which is based in London and is one of Africa's largest crypto exchanges, is funding this venture from its own balance sheet rather than via a fund structure, which Cheng explained provides greater flexibility.  ""The reason we didn’t go with a fund structure is because we don’t need any external funding to be able to build this business, both from a capital and management fee perspective,"" said Cheng. ""It also allows us to finance investments with evergreen capital, which we believe is more valuable to founders building companies in the fintech space.""  Luno Expeditions has so far made investments in 20 companies, including a crypto compliance tool in Israel and a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace in the U.S.  Many of the world's major crypto exchanges boast an investment arm as part of their structure in order to generate growth in the broader digital assets ecosystem.

Traders in 2018-19 endured a similar death march. The charts speak for themselves (stunning vistas of troughs and valleys are abundant among the few names that survived at all), but in some ways on-chain activity paints an even more desolate picture.  Weekly active Ethereum addresses fell as low as 165,000 in February 2019. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) effectively didn’t exist until Moloch DAO and MakerDAO resuscitated the concept. OpenSea, now a non-fungible token (NFT) powerhouse transacting in the billions of dollars, sold $475,000 in tokens total for the entire 2018 year. Decentralized finance (DeFi) accounted for under a million dollars.  This time around the bear looks a little different, to say the least. Indeed, there’s even some debate as to whether or not we’re truly in a bear market at all: In traditional finance, bear markets are marked by a 20% downturn. In crypto, grizzled old heads will tell you the carnage hasn’t started until your favorite long-term play is down 90% ... and then another 90% when you try to buy the dip.  By those standards, so far the bear market of 2022 looks more like Winnie the Pooh than a proper predator.  Ethereum continues to fizz with activity, with pockets of development, usage and adoption that remain robust – and one could argue might even be stronger than ever – in spite of anemic price action.  Ultimately, it’s a sign of the maturity of the technology. In 2018 the ecosystem was the asset: The only value Ethereum had was the speculative promise of what it could one day become, and to what degree ether (ETH) reflected that promise.  Today, vast swaths of what’s being built on Ethereum are largely agnostic to ether’s price, and in at least one instance may even be inversely correlated. Far from a horrific trek across a desolate, bloody tundra, this bear market features plenty for Ethereans to be excited about.  Let’s take a look:  DeFi defiant  Since the end of January, the aggregate total value locked (TVL) across the DeFi ecosystem has remained in a comparatively tight $210 billion to $190 billion range, despite price fluctuations upwards of 25% in ETH ($3,250-$2,400), and even more volatility from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains like Avalanche’s AVAX ($98-$65) and Fantom’s FTM ($2.4-$1.05) during the same period.  This stable rate of deposits roughly confirms the thesis I laid out in early December 2021: Despite having a reputation for being used primarily as a tool for speculation and leverage, DeFi will remain robust even during times of market turbulence – and, indeed, perhaps even in an extended bear market – because of the ample income opportunities afforded to users.  Read more: After Major Crypto Sell-Off, Why Did DeFi Stay So Sticky?  Back then, I was trying to figure out why DeFi was so resilient in the face of a veritable Kubrickian blood-elevator in prices: Bitcoin (BTC) nosedived from $57,000 to $42,000, while ether tanked from $4,600 to $3,500 – all in a matter of hours. And yet, deposits remained healthy.  What experts told me was that as long as yield farmers can reap bumper returns relative to off-chain opportunities, the deposits will stick around. In fact, many yields are actually driven by volatility: Uniswap positions, for instance, feast on high volumes. In some ways, DeFi can actively benefit from blood elevators.  The outlook for traders remains grim, but for those who venture into the fields opportunities abound.  The face of mainstream NFT adoption  In NFT-land volumes and floor prices look anemic compared to 2021 highs, but ultimately the market’s vitals are not those of a patient on life support – not even close.  On the one hand, OpenSea’s Ethereum volumes are set to post an eight-month low. On the other, monthly active users are on pace to narrowly break the all-time high of ~550,000. Not to mention, the overwhelming market leader just closed a funding raise at a $13.3 billion valuation.  Trying to scry floor prices also yields mixed signals. Volumes for popular collections are down as much as 60% on a 30-day basis, and floors for CryptoPunks are also down 50% from their highs. Nonetheless, newcomers like Azukis continue to break into the top-10 charts and sell out with ease.  Mainstream adoption continues at a stunning clip. Nike (NKE) made one of the few acquisitions in its company history when it bought RTFKT, and NFTs are widely reported to have taken center stage at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival.  Add to all of that a recent report from Nansen shows that NFTs may be inversely correlated to broader crypto markets – a sign they may be emerging as an asset class in their own right.  Cherry-pick from above however you like. I’m assuming the Kotakus of the world will attempt another “NFTs are dead” piece at some point and they have a reasonable case, but I’m personally dubious this all collectively gets put back in the box.  NFTs are leading the adoption charge for crypto, and while the most high-profile new entrants skew older (say, newly unretired quarterback Tom Brady or former New York Times writer Kevin Roose), the demographic coming in is overwhelmingly young and willing to experiment. I don’t think they’re going anywhere.  If NFTs can survive Kevin, they can survive the bear.  DAO sentiment  Finally, when it comes to DAOs, the nascent organizations are widely anticipated to be a hotspot for innovation and development throughout the bear market – and for good reason.  Having prepared for this bear for years, DAO treasuries are likely to emerge as one of the most popular sources of developer funding in the coming months and years. The money is abundant enough that CoinDesk’s own Tracy Wang has wondered if the organizations could replace traditional VC firms.  Money aside, however, here’s my pitch on why DAOs will emerge from the bear stronger than ever: There are dozens, if not hundreds, of tremendously well-capitalized entities that have glaring needs, and instead of waiting for our VC overlords to fund solutions, they can shell out the dough to address those needs themselves.  Huge swaths of that estimated $9.1 billion in treasury funds will go to tooling, and there will be far fewer pain points this time next year.  Cute Lil Grizzly Bear  If any of this strikes our loyal readers as overly optimistic, I don’t blame you! Price action has been sucking wind.  Still, even the most beaten and bloodied trader can’t compare the current bear with the last one. Price action was all that mattered back then; today, even an inexperienced user can deposit funds across a wide range of platforms offering smart contract-based equivalents of most financial services. They can then vote on the future health of those platforms via DAO governance, and I don’t know why they would, but they can even collect cute monkey picture NFTs with the interest on their deposits.  And that’s the opportunities afforded to a casual user – for developers, the options and promise are unending.  The technology has largely delivered on its promise. Put in the most basic terms, the difference between the last bear and this one is that there’s stuff to do, and after a historic bull run there’s money to spend doing it.  This simple fact is a testament to the work believers put in four years ago, and it’s why this trek through the tundra won’t be as grueling.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  Ethereum builder ConsenSys raised $450 million at a $7 billion valuation. BACKGROUND: ConsenSys has been a core driver in the development and usage of the Ethereum ecosystem. For instance, MetaMask, ConsenSys’s flagship Ethereum wallet, has reached over 30 million monthly active users, while Infura, a platform created by ConsenSys that provides API services to connect to Ethereum, has over 430,000 developers. The company is reportedly planning aggressive expansion, though looming litigation from disgruntled shareholders may slow it down.  The Ethereum Foundation announced the Kiln Merge testnet, which is “expected to be the last merge testnet created before existing public testnets are upgradeable.” BACKGROUND: The Kiln is set to be a successor to the Kintsugi merge testnet, which allowed Ethereum developers to successfully implement stable and robust protocol specifications for the ecosystem. Now that developers, node operators, infrastructure providers and stakers can test on the Kiln testnet, we are closer than ever to a proof-of-stake Ethereum mainnet.  A $200 million raise has valued Immutable, a liquidity and scaling platform for NFT’s built on Ethereum, at $2.5 billion. BACKGROUND: The funds will be used toward global expansion, including boosting Immutable Gaming Studio and merger-and-acquisitions activity. Robbie Ferguson, co-founder and president of Immutable, said on CoinDesk’s “First Mover” for March 15, 2022, that Immutable plans to bring blockchain gaming to the masses and reinvent the most important Web 2 companies, especially in social media.  Goldman Sachs (GS) is offering clients access to an ether fund through Galaxy Digital, a technology-driven financial services firm. BACKGROUND: Regulatory documents filed last week with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission show the fund has sold approximately $50 million to clients with a minimum investment amount of $250,000. The bank’s attempt to offer more exposure in ether to their clients demonstrates large institutional demand for digital assets and its ecosystem.

42395763,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzLHO,1647442863,DeFi Platform Aave Lauches Version 3 With Cross-Chain Swaps Front and Center,"One of the largest lending platforms in decentralized finance (DeFi) is taking a step forward Wednesday with the launch of a third iteration, or “v3.”  The Aave Companies announced the launch of Aave v3 across six different blockchains, with a seventh – Ethereum mainnet – forthcoming at an unspecified date.  The release follows a series of votes in Aave’s governance forums concerning on which chains the new protocol would launch, as well as a December vote on a business license for the protocol designed to prevent forks.  According to Aave founder Stani Kulechov, v3 will feature a range of new functionalities and mechanisms designed to improve user experience, risk management and capital efficiency.  The upgrades may help further cement Aave as a leading money market. According to DefiLlama, Aave is currently the second-largest lender with over $11 billion in total value locked (TVL), trailing only the Terra blockchain-based Anchor with over $13 billion.  Headlining the new features are cross-chain “portals,” isolated markets that will allow the protocol to better compete with permissionless counterparts and a “high efficiency” mode enabling high loan-to-value borrowing on select assets.  Cross-chain lending  Currently, Aave is live on Avalanche, Ethereum and Polygon, with dozens of assets featuring variable borrow and interest rates on each chain.  Along with interest rates, liquidity demand can vary significantly between the chains, and Kulechov expects those returns and demand fluctuations to “flatten” as a new cross-chain “portals” feature goes live.  Portals is a feature that allows cross-chain bridges to mint and burn atokens – tokens representing deposits into Aave. Bridges will mint Aave’s “aTokens” on one chain and burn them on another, maintaining accounting between the different chains while allowing users to pursue yield arbitrage and other strategies.  “You could deposit in [Ethereum] mainnet, but borrow from Polygon and repay on Avalanche – all under the hood,” said Kulechov.  Isolated markets  In addition to greater capital mobility, v3 also makes it significantly easier to onboard new forms of collateral, albeit with stripped down utility.  “V3 is mostly about two things: risk awareness/mitigation, and capital efficiency,” said Kulechov. “In terms of risk mitigation, we can actually reduce the risk of new collaterals coming into the ecosystem, and still get them listed but with limited exposure.”  Aave is facing increasing pressure from lending platforms like Euler, Kashi and Rari that can better cater to long-tail or exotic assets with permissionless lending pools.  Read more: Euler Finance Launches New DeFi Lending Platform in Crowded Market  As a result, v3 introduces “isolated markets” – effectively a pipeline for allowing Aave governance to list assets as collateral faster than the current process, but only as a single source of collateral, and not as a bundle.  Additionally, isolated markets will have supply caps controlled by the DAO governance.  “Over time, as that asset matures you can increase the ceilings, and eventually turn the isolation model for particular assets off. So it kind of allows asset scalability,” added Kulechov.  Collateral efficiency  Finally, the feature about which Kulechov said he was most excited is the forthcoming “high efficiency mode.”  This feature will allow users to leverage extremely high loan-to-value ratios so long as they take loans in the same asset that they deposit as collateral – in some instances, even up to 98% LTV.  A screenshot of a dashboard for the feature included ether (ETH) and staked ETH derivatives, wrapped bitcoin (BTC) like wBTC and renBTC and stablecoins.  “The main idea here is that once we have different kinds of stablecoins – euro stablecoins, pound stablecoins – then you can essentially have FX trading on-chain,” Kulechov said.  However, one area in which v3 will not have an impact is in Aave’s institution-focused compliant implementation, Aave Arc.  Read more: Fireblocks ‘Whitelists’ 30 Trading Firms for Aave’s Institutional DeFi Debut  “The nature of the Aave Arc market, it should be the most boring market out there. The participants, they don’t want to see changes. They want to see boring, everything working fine. Once v3 becomes more proven, then we can bring the v3 infrastructure to Arc,” said Kulechov.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | MATIC,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/16/defi-platform-aave-lauches-v3-with-cross-chain-swaps-front-and-center,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9308f599f966cfafa038bfd44fbfb182006b6aba-1441x940.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395773,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzLPG,1647440747,NY Fed Staffer Jumps Into DeFi as Euler COO,"DeFi’s latest headline hire comes from an unusual source: the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  On Wednesday, permissionless crypto lending protocol Euler Finance announced the appointment of Brandon Neal as chief operating officer.  Neal spent 10 years at the New York Fed in a variety of roles, including most recently with the Markets Trading Desk, or what Neal called “the tip of the spear in implementing monetary policy” in an interview with CoinDesk.  The career transition was facilitated in part by Dave White, a protocol design specialist at crypto venture giant Paradigm and a friend of Neal’s who turned him on to novel concepts in decentralized finance – such as flash loans and automated market makers – over lunch.  Afterwards, Neal began more deeply researching the space and eventually met the team at Euler, where he was impressed with the group's deliberate and iterative approach designed to mitigate the risks associated with permissionless finance.  “Of all the teams I spoke with I was excited most about the team at Euler – having a super, super robust risk management system, carefully designed and built and thoughtfully implemented, is paramount,” said Neal.  In December, Euler founder Michael Bentley told CoinDesk that the protocol’s growth would be a process and not an event. The platform currently accounts for $52 million in total value locked (TVL), per DefiLlama.  Read more: Euler Finance Launches New DeFi Lending Platform in Crowded Market  “From our perspective, we’re really focused on managing risk – I don’t want to target some total value locked number we can market to people,” Bentley said.  ‘Bloated’ industry  Neal told CoinDesk that he believes decentralized finance (DeFi) has the potential to significantly shake up the finance world.  “If we zoom out and look at what finance is supposed to do, it was always meant to be the oil that greases the wheels of real industry. It was never meant to become a wheel unto itself that employs an excessive number of people and becomes rent-seeking, to use an economics term. But it’s become that – the financial industry is bloated, it’s not innovative, and there’s valid arguments that it’s stuck,” he said.  He admitted that a “handful” of his former colleagues think he’s crazy for the career shift, but many of them are coming around to the promise of the DeFi sector, particularly as new use cases develop.  “Everybody is rightfully skeptical. People who work at the Fed are skeptics by nature – it’s evidence-based, and you look at outcomes,” said Neal, adding:  “There are elements of hype in crypto that can often drown out the real, deep innovation happening by serious, thoughtful teams. Those people are the loudest in the room sometimes, and the thoughtful builders who are meticulously and carefully innovating, they’re just really quiet.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/16/ny-fed-staffer-jumps-into-defi-as-euler-coo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f682b1dfe147dd41ef8b9286c2e9e4b4376befe-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company offers a white-label product that allows any brand to launch a mobile service and serve as a mobile operator for end users or companies, Oxio CEO Nicolas Girard told CoinDesk. In other words, Oxio develops and operates the service, but other companies sell the service under their own brands.  As with projects like Helium, GIANT and others, Oxio is taking a crypto twist on non-finance applications in the realm of bandwidth and connectivity. Notably, it’s also working with big brands.  The company now has 15 clients in Mexico, including Grupo Bimbo, the country’s largest bread maker, and Rappi, a leading food delivery app in the region that uses Oxio to provide internet service to its riders, Girard said.  Ascend, Leydon and CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group also participated in the funding round and were joined by previous investors Multicoin Capital, Monashees, Atlantico Capital and FinTech Collective.  The proceeds will be used to accelerate Oxio’s business in Mexico and expand its network to the U.S. and Brazil, Girard said, adding that the company plans to boost its product and engineering teams in the U.S. and Mexico.  “The best way to think about the role of the blockchain is around a wireless data token, so harnessing wireless as an asset class,” Girard previously told CoinDesk. “You’ve never traded wireless because there’s no instrument to address it,” he added.  Read more: Blockchain Startup Raises $12M Series A to Turn Brands Into Cellular Networks  Integrations with telco companies in the U.S. are “almost done,” Girard said in an interview this week, adding that the company is working on integrations in Brazil, in a process that usually takes five months. According to Girard, current regulations in countries such as Brazil and Mexico require telecommunications or satellite operators to provide access to companies such as Oxio.  The price of mobile data needs to fall by 80% to allow all people in Latin America to be connected, Girar said.  “That is a deadlock that we are in, and the only way we can do that is by opening up access to the infrastructure to companies like us, to create new opportunities and a new business model,” he said.

42395786,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzLX8,1647435563,First Mover Americas: Focus on Fed's Inflation Take,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Fed set to hike rates by 25 basis points. Fed's language on inflation and recent tightening of financial conditions may inject volatility into the market.  Chartist's Corner: Bitcoin bulls eye cloud resistance.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Today’s show will feature guests:  Rebecca Rettig, general counsel, Aave  Metta Sandiford-Artest, former LA Laker  Ben Emons, managing director, Medley Global Advisors  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) will announce its monetary policy decisions on Wednesday at 18:00 UTC. The rate decision will be followed by Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference.  ""It makes sense to start the tightening cycle with a 25-basis point rate hike,"" Morgan Stanley's chief economist, Ellen Zentner, told Bloomberg early Wednesday.  Indeed, a 25-basis point Fed rate hike is a foregone conclusion. Interest rate derivatives show traders are pricing a total of seven quarter percentage point hikes in borrowing costs for 2022. Further, the central bank is expected to raise forecasts for inflation and median terminal rate – the peak interest rate to 3%, as discussed on Friday.  Therefore, risk assets, including bitcoin, are likely to take cues from the central bank's language on inflation and the recent tightening of financial conditions, which could signal the Fed's willingness to pursue aggressive series of rate hikes in the coming months.  The Fed's December statement said: ""Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation.""  According to Jon Turek, author of the Cheap Convexity blog, the Fed may introduce a hawkish change in the language, emphasizing the need to stop high inflation from becoming a norm and threatening economic growth.  ""I think we are due for a hawkish shift to the inflation portion of the statement and that March meeting is when that begins,"" Turek said in the Fed preview published Tuesday.  ""Something to watch for is a sentence to appear in the statement this week that echoes the tone Powell was trying to communicate in his congressional testimony two weeks ago, the Fed is trying to engineer a sustainable expansion. Powell said the Fed will use its tool to make sure that happens and that higher inflation does not become entrenched,"" Turek added.  The headline consumer price index rose to a four-decade high of 7.9% last month and the core personal consumption expenditure deflator, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, stood at a 30-year high. Add to that the risk of the Russia-Ukraine conflict sending a new inflation wave across the globe and the possibility of the Fed introducing a hawkish change in the inflation language appears to be strong.  Moreover, such a change may rekindle fears of a 50-basis point rate hike in the coming months, perhaps putting asset prices under pressure. ""Powell's tone on inflation will go a long way to showing where he is on the 50bps debate,"" Turek noted. Traders scaled back expectations for a 50-basis point hike in March following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.  Powell downplaying the recent tightening of financial conditions during the press conference could also see traders price in aggressive tightening.  Markets have done the Fed's job to some extent, as data tracked by Goldman Sachs shows that U.S. financial conditions have tightened the most since June 2020. That could slow down economic growth in the near term. As such, Powell is widely expected to express discomfort about tightening financial conditions.  Lastly, Fed's comments on quantitative tightening (QT) or the process of balance sheet normalization, a way of sucking out liquidity from the system, will be keenly followed by traders. The Fed discussed QT in December and then pushed out the great balance sheet unwinding to the third quarter just before the war broke out in Europe. A hint of an early start to quantitative tightening may bring selling to the market.

Will XTZ buyers withstand the pressure? Key technical points: XTZ prices rest at the $2.90 support level. The 50-day EMA promotes the lower high formation. The 24-hour trading volume of Tezos is $89 Million, marking a 38% rise. Past Performance of XTZ On 1st March, the XTZ coin price faced rejection at the new-upcoming resistance trendline resulting in the descending triangle pattern. The $2.89 support level creates the base for the triangle pattern, and overall the triangle accounts for a downfall of 35% last month. Finally, the price fills up the triangle indicating the breakout point arrival. Source-Tradingview XTZ Technical Analysis XTZ coin price faces extreme selling pressure evident by the increase in trading volume as the altcoin faces rejection from the trendline. Thus, the chances of a bearish breakout resulting in a fall to $2.5 increases. After achieving the bearish alignment, the crucial EMAs (50,100, and 200) maintain a falling trend. Meanwhile, the 50-day EMA moves along the resistance trendline and provides a consistent dynamic barrier.

As of Tuesday, 10,462 bitcoin miners and 712 Ethereum miners have been deployed in the firm's North America sites, which equate to 0.511 exahash/second (EH/s) and 0.188 terahash/second (TH/s) of computing power respectively. All of its rigs have been in North America since November, but it takes a while to secure electricity and develop the facilities to house them, the miner said in a press release.  In total, the firm held 27,744 bitcoin miners and 731 Ethereum miners at the end of 2021. It also placed an order for 10,000 machines with Bitmain last October, for a maximum price of $65 million, the firm said in the press release.  Bit Digital mined 240.57 bitcoins (BTC) in the fourth quarter of last year, a substantial fall from the 695.96 BTC mined in the fourth quarter of 2020. The drop was primarily due to the migration and redeployment of the mining machines, the firm said.  All in all, Bit Digital expects 103 megawatts (MW) of hosting capacity for its mining rigs to be ready by the end of the year, paying a base fee for power and hosting of $0.037 per kilowatt-hour on average across different contracts.  Compute North is providing around 20 MW to Bit Digital's mining sites in Nebraska and Texas, and will deliver another 28 MW of hosting capacity to the miner during the last two quarters of this year, according to the press release.

Ethereum’s multi-stage shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism would validate transactions using nodes run by “stakers.” This is in favor of the current proof-of-work design, which relies on centralized entities called “miners” for validating transactions on the network.  “Merge” refers to deploying Ethereum’s execution layer – the term for the current Ethereum network – to the “consensus layer” of the Beacon chain, the term for Ethereum’s upcoming proof-of-stake blockchain.  Kiln is expected to be the last merge testnet created before existing public testnets are upgraded, Ethereum Foundation developers said in a post. Application and tooling developers, node operators, infrastructure providers and stakers are currently encouraged to test on Kiln.  While the Merge was largely successful, developer Tim Beiko pointed out a single client was not producing blocks and that the issue was being looked into.  Stakers have locked up over 10 million ether (ETH), which was valued at over $25 billion at the time, on the Eth 2.0 deposit contract, as reported. Locked ether effectively takes out freely-traded ether from the open market while reducing circulating supply.  Ether issuance per block would drop by two ether once the merge is live on the public Ethereum network. This would add to further pressure on supply and act as a catalyst for ether prices in the long term, some analysts say.  Ether gained 6.2% over the past 24 hours as the merge was deployed on Kiln.

One year ago, Beeple&apos;s &apos;Everydays: The First 5000 Days&apos; sold for over USD 69 million as an NFT at the prestigious auction house Christie&apos;s. Since then, NFTs have undergone a radical paradigm shift from being an obscure tech phenomenon to a mainstream one. The NFT industry has continued to expand at an astounding rate, with conservative estimates indicating that this area has risen by more than 1,785% since Q1 of 2021. The explosive trend involving NFTs has led the sales volume of NFT marketplaces to skyrocket to over USD 40 billion.

Bitcoin jumped from $39,120 to $41,700 in 30 minutes to 02:15 UTC (10:15 p.m. ET) only to fall back to $39,000 by 03:30 UTC, CoinDesk data shows. The sudden rise perhaps stemmed from stop orders on short trades and ran into stronger selling pressure.  ""There was a sharp jump in the rate from $39,200 to $41,700, followed by an almost equally rapid pullback to the area below $39,000. Stop orders were triggered in the morning low-liquid market, but it is clear that the selling pressure remains huge,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FXPro, said in an email.  ""In fact, since Feb. 10, the rises in the bitcoin rate have become less and less long and end at ever lower levels,"" Kuptsikevich added.  The cryptocurrency has recently seen multiple bull failures above $42,000. The latest from today's Asian session likely resulted from the activity of market makers – entities quoting both a buy and a sell price in a tradable asset held in inventory satisfy the market.  ""In sluggish and bearish markets, market makers have a tendency to be systematically short the market, i.e. they are outright selling on exchange and/or sell the futures,"" Laurent Kssis, a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert and director of CEC Capital said.  ""If a spike like we've seen this a.m. occurs, then there is a risk the exchanges will call for more margin and hence [market makers] risk being liquidated. To avoid that, market makers push the market down, [perhaps by shorting the cryptocurrency in the spot or futures market],"" Kssis added.  Broadly speaking, trading activity has cooled in recent weeks, as evidenced by the declining trending in daily trading volumes on major exchanges. As such, relatively smaller trade sizes can have a notable impact on the market.  ""Recently, there has been a lack of dynamism in both the spot and derivatives markets. Yesterday's BTC spot trading volume was slightly over $7 billion, while the perpetual contract trading volume was only around $40 billion,"" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto-asset management company Blofin said in a Telegram chat. "" Since derivatives rely on index prices, it is not difficult to ""spot blast"" against the BTC index prices in several smaller exchanges in this case.""  Looking ahead, the liquidity could remain thin at least until the Federal Reserve rate decision, scheduled at 18:00 UTC. The U.S. central bank is expected to hike interest rates by 25 basis points, kicking off the tightening cycle that is expected to take rates to highs of 2.5% from the current 0.25%.  Bitcoin was trading near $40,300 at press time, representing a 2% gain on the day.  UPDATE (March 16, 10:56 UTC): Federal Reserve rate decision is scheduled at 18:00 UTC.

Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post (SCMP) appears to have found one in selling non-fungible tokens (NFT) of its front pages from historical events, and has such confidence in the business that it is spinning it off into its own division called Artifact Labs.  The SCMP’s NFTs are front pages from historical events such as the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, the Avian flu outbreak, the Asian Financial Crisis and the death of the U.K.'s Princess Diana.  Its NFT collection exists on Flow, a blockchain built by Dapper Labs, which also powers NBA’s Top Shot collection.  Buyers can bid on a specific NFT from a historical event, or buy a mystery box of front pages from selected events.  In its last auction, the newspaper sold over 1,000 NFTs and brought in approximately $127,000.  “SCMP’s creation of ‘Artifact Labs’ to explore the potential of blockchain applications for media is a transformational step for our 118-year old organization,” said SCMP Chairman Joe Tsai.  Tsai is also the co-founder and executive vice-chairman of Alibaba (BABA).  SCMP will continue to be a shareholder in Artifact Labs and will seek third-party capital to help fund the company’s growth, according to a press release.  In late December, Tsai tweeted: “I like crypto,” hinting at the future expansion of his businesses into crypto. As mainland China-based Alibaba can’t get deeply involved in crypto, SCMP’s foray into NFTs is a logical step for his crypto expansion.

Bitcoin is trading up 6% over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko.  The uptick in price comes as major equity markets in Asia open for trading Wednesday in the green, shrugging off contagion fears of the U.S.-China equities skirmish, while investors in the region wait for Fed minutes to be released.  Tokyo's Nikkei 225 opened 1.6%, Korea's KOSPI is up 0.85%, Singapore's Straits Times Index is up 1.4% and Taiwan's TAIEX is flat.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, which had its worst trading days since the 2008 recession, is up 2.6%. Despite the intense market decline in Hong Kong, bitcoin had been spared from the carnage.  As the Tuesday trading day came to a close in the U.S., bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies traded slightly higher given an expectation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by 25 basis points.  Even with the modest rally, bitcoin and most of the broader crypto market continue in their choppy range of the past few weeks, with geopolitical, economic and regulatory uncertainties perhaps as great as they've been in many years.

He added that states that “ban technologies they cannot control commit a mistake,” and that the U.S. has to be ready to seize the opportunity to become a leader.  The event in Miami took place as that city and New York City race to become a hub for the fast-growing digital asset industry and attract blockchain businesses with high-paying jobs.  Adams stressed that blockchain technology can help combat income inequality and serve as a tool for giving incentives to residents. He said governments can use blockchain technology to send food stamps directly to digital wallets, put public records on the blockchain, or give out a dollar-to-dollar reimbursement for such products as healthy baby food.  He also said that he is “going to build a blockchain and crypto educational platform” for young people and will “give them cryptocurrency” to learn about the technology.  Earlier in his keynote speech, Suarez said Miami’s local government created “a back-office concierge service to help companies with onboarding and relocating” in the city.  Both mayors are known for their crypto-friendly agenda and public announcements to take their salaries in bitcoin (BTC). Adams, who was sworn in on Dec. 31, promised to convert his first three paychecks into the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Suarez reiterated that he took all his pay in bitcoin starting in December.  Crypto has assumed a new focus in politics in recent weeks as the U.S. and ally countries attempt to isolate Russia from the global financial system with sanctions for invading Ukraine. The U.S. has been monitoring whether Russia has been using crypto to evade sanctions, and it has been pressuring crypto companies to join those from other industries in halting services for Russian nationals.
