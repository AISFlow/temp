42420313,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUf0Mn,1685576711,"Bitcoin, Crypto Prices Brace for Downturn in Coming Liquidity Shock, Observers Say","Crypto markets are bracing for a downturn as liquidity tightening resumes after the U.S. debt ceiling is lifted, observers said.  The replenishment of the U.S. Treasury general account and the Federal Reserve (Fed) winding down its balance sheet will remove hundreds of billions of dollars from the financial system, weighing on cryptocurrency prices in the coming months.  Thawing liquidity conditions earlier this year helped lift the prices of risk assets, including equities and digital assets. The market-wide crypto rally propelled bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, to as high as $31,000 before turning into a meme coin speculative frenzy reminiscent of the sugar rush near bull market tops.  The trend, however, is set to turn once U.S. lawmakers approve raising the government’s ability to issue new debt, putting pressure on risky investments.  First, the U.S. Treasury will have to refill its almost completely depleted Treasury General Account (TGA), which means replenishing some $500 billion of cash from the financial system.  “This is likely to especially hit risk assets as they tend to be more sensitive to liquidity conditions than safer plays such as bonds and many groups of equities,” macro analyst Noelle Acheson said.  “The Treasury drawing down its account at the Fed was one of the tailwinds for the market earlier this year, as money that would normally just sit there was put into the economy in the form of government expenditures,” Acheson explained.  “Now, the reverse is likely to happen: the government needs to replenish that account balance by issuing debt which will draw liquidity out of the market and back into the Treasury's account.”  Read more: What Does the Debt Limit Showdown Mean for Bitcoin?  Refilling the general account coincides with the Fed continuing its quantitative tightening campaign, briefly interrupted in March due to the regional banking crisis, to reduce its bloated balance sheet from propping up the economy during the pandemic.  Macro analyst Lyn Alden called this a “negative double-whammy for liquidity” in a market report.  “The attractiveness of many large liquidity-driven equities is lackluster for the next few months unless or until we get more clarity on forward liquidity conditions,” Alden said. “This is an environment where an investor should know what they own, be prepared for volatility and avoid excessive leverage.”  The debt ceiling resolution bill – if passed in its current form – will also contribute to the negative impact on liquidity, according to Tom Dunleavy, founder of Dunleavy Investment Research.  Some key points of the deal such as curbing non-defense funding, clawing back unspent pandemic relief funds and resuming student loan payments will constrain the available money left for consumers to invest, he explained in a tweet. ""Liquidity is going to be very net negative,” Dunleavy added.  The U.S. House of Representatives is poised to vote on raising the debt ceiling Wednesday evening.  Tightening liquidity conditions, decreasing probability of the Fed cutting interest rates this year and the present trading environment with depressed volatility and volumes make crypto markets ripe for a shock, institutional trading platform FalconX wrote in a newsletter.  “This macro scenario (...) makes me believe we could be in a calm-before-the-storm moment for crypto,” David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/31/bitcoin-crypto-prices-brace-for-downturn-in-coming-liquidity-shock-observers-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ed02917aeb654f40a157e939143fa68354513d6-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13067722,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535978,1685572241,Did The US SEC Just Endorse Ethereum After This Settlement?,"On May 30, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that Ishan Wahi, the former Coinbase product manager, and his brother, Nikhil Wahi, had agreed to settle charges brought forth by the regulator accusing them of engaging in an insider trading scheme. SEC Settlement With Former Coinbase Product Manager In this way, the two defendants also agreed that their actions violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act. Accordingly, Ishan has been sentenced to two years in prison, while his brother, Nikhil, will serve ten months behind bars. In a statement, the SEC also said the former Coinbase product manager forfeited 10.97 ETH and 9,440 USDT. On the other hand, Nikhil has submitted to the state 892,500 USDT. Related Reading: Russia scraps plans for a national cryptocurrency exchange, as HedgeUp (HDUP) Prepares for world Domination migrating on Stellar This is part of the settlement and forfeiture of securities the SEC said were ill-gotten. The case was settled roughly a year after the SEC filed the suit at the District Court for the Western District of Washington, accusing the former Coinbase product manager of using confidential information to benefit from trading crypto assets, most of which, the regulator claims, were securities. According to the Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, Gurbir S. Grewal, their actions amounted to insider trading. Grewal stated: While the technologies at issue, in this case, may be new, the conduct is not. We allege that Ishan and Nikhil Wahi, respectively, tipped and traded securities based on material nonpublic information, and that’s insider trading, pure and simple. How Will The SEC Handle Ethereum? While the SEC succeeded, questions are being asked about how the regulator will allow the forfeiture of those digital assets, including Ethereum, in a way that the regulator considers legal and lawful. Though there is an argument that all assets received from the two brothers will be forfeited to the Department of Justice (DoJ), some maintain that the SEC must first confirm receipt. Recently, Gary Gensler, the chairman of the SEC, failed to clarify whether Ethereum, like Bitcoin, is a commodity that should be treated as a property and its capital gains tax. While in front of the House Financial Services Committee, Gensler repeatedly said the agency was learning more about Ethereum. This didn’t help ETH since a clear endorsement from the SEC, the principal regulator, could lead to regulatory clarity, possibly driving prices and on-chain activity. SEC’s position differs from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which classifies Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin as commodities, not securities.

42420321,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUf0X7,1685570621,"Pixel Penguins, an NFT Charity Scam, Shows Dangers Of NFT Influencer Culture","Achieving influencer status on social media is something that many up-and-coming non-fungible token (NFT) collectors dream of. Hidden behind profile-picture (PFP) NFTs are figures who send “gm” messages, share the latest crypto news and boost morale within the Web3 community when the market takes a blow.  Many of these influencers have amassed tens of thousands – sometimes millions – of followers. But with a large following comes a responsibility to act in good faith, knowing that their tweets may sway opinions about whether to buy or sell an NFT.  The role becomes less glamorous when an influencer promotes an NFT project that turns out to be a scam.  On Tuesday morning, Web3 influencer Andrew Wang posted a Twitter thread promoting an NFT collection called Pixel Penguins. In his post, he shared that one of his friends named “Sarah,” or Hopeexist1 on Twitter, had been battling cancer since and released the collection to raise money for her hefty medical bills.  “I'll put my rep on the line to say this is for real amidst all the scams in our space,” said Wang. “I speak with her art teacher often when she's gone for treatment and he says she's the best student he's ever had, that her talent is too precious, that she must survive.”  According to Wang’s thread, each NFT in the pixelated art collection was $13 to mint, with 20% of the profits donated to charity while the rest would be used to pay for Sarah’s treatment. The collection was not new – it was launched in February, and Twitter user LeviNotAckerman previously shared a similar story about the Pixel Penguins collection in April.  Wang’s tweet gained traction on Twitter, and soon many users, likely encouraged by his conviction, began to mint Pixel Penguins to help her cause. Within hours of the initial thread, Pixel Penguins sold out and began to trend on secondary marketplace OpenSea, with its floor price raising to 0.07 ETH, or about $130, on Tuesday evening.  However, as the day wound down, Twitter users began to suspect that the project was not all it claimed to be. Soon, users uncovered dubious tweets from Sarah’s account dating back to 2021 and resurfaced prior accusations of stolen artwork. Some even suggested that her cancer diagnosis was made up to attract donations.  But the damage had already been done. Soon, the Hopeexist1 Twitter account was deleted, along with other traces of the account across the internet.  As rumors intensified, pseudonymous crypto sleuth ZachXBT shared ETH addresses linked to the Pixel Penguin NFT collection, showing that the contract had amassed nearly 61.6 ETH, or about $117,000. Two hours later, ZachXBT shared that 63.5 ETH, nearly $119,000, of the funds earned from the project were distributed across two new wallet addresses. While users who had been duped rushed to figure out how to recoup their losses, the scammers apparently deposited funds into a wallet on cryptocurrency exchange OKX, further obfuscating their paper trail.  “I wanted to help a struggling artist that was battling cancer,” shared Twitter user DachshundWizard, who wrote that he had been taken advantage of. “I felt like I could use the momentum from today of giving hundreds of thousands to people for nothing for good – it worked, but it turned into a rug and I was taken advantage big time.”  As of publishing, the collection’s floor price has plummeted to 0.004 ETH, or about $7. Still, the collection has raked in 216 ETH, or about $403,000, in trading volume, according to OpenSea.  Blame, shame and anger  Many NFT collectors who fell for the apparent rug pull began directing their anger at those they felt misguided them, especially Andrew Wang.  In the hours after the Hopeexist1 story imploded, Wang posted a follow-up thread denouncing the collection and apologizing for his role in its promotion.  “I didn't have the proper wisdom to navigate something like this,” wrote Wang. “Hearing a story as heartbreaking as hers, backed up with art that she was making, made it hard for me to be objective.”  He tweeted that he had spoken to someone claiming to be her teacher before buying her artwork, which gave the allure of legitimacy.  “I would say that I would be better in the future, but to be honest, I'm not sure that I would be any different,” Wang wrote. “I personally feel hurt and cheated … and I feel more terrible that the community bought into Pixel Penguins following me being one of the people who shared her story. I'm deeply sorry about that.”  For some, the apology was not enough, considering the impact of his promotion among his thousands of followers. Another user pointed out that he had posted another thread promoting her work in December 2022.  “How did you verify her story?” asked ZachXBT. “Ngl most people probably minted bc of your thread.”  “I bought one of her pieces, trusting you had verified this,” said user Rocketgirl.  Wang declined to be interviewed for this story.  The role of influencers in Web3  The crypto community has gravitated towards social media sites like Twitter and Discord for years in order to find community and anticipate price movements. As PFP projects grew in popularity, NFT enthusiasts took to the platform to show off their holdings and develop followings around their digital identities. This has led to an influx of influencers with thousands of followers evangelizing and pushing NFT collections, often without any oversight.  Investments are always risky, especially in the crypto space, and even more so when dealing with NFTs that have an artistic or emotional value attributed to them. It can be difficult to discern honest projects from grift, which is why influencers often position themselves as trusted thought leaders.  But scam after NFT scam has served as a reminder that trusting one source explicitly without doing your own research – a tenet of the crypto space – is a fool’s errand.  Read more: NFT Scams: How To Avoid Falling Victim  Thousands of jittery users tuned into a Twitter Space on Tuesday night to hear from a handful of influencers, including Wang, about the Pixel Penguins scam.  While the discussion focused on the lies that were used to prop up the project, Twitter user Fetty spoke up about the greater implications of influencers promoting collections that sometimes turn out to be rug pulls.  “I've kind of heard people iterate the point that it's really hard to do due diligence, or like, we can't blame [influencers] for not realizing this was a scam,” said Fetty. “If you're going to be in a position of influence like this… or even try and support projects, you have to take responsibility.”  Wang responded, claiming that he never meant to provide any investment guidance or push individuals to mint NFTs from the collection.  “Please don't ever take what I say as trading advice,” said Wang. “If I hinted at that today with my tweets, I don't think I did, but because that's where the space is … I'm sorry.”  While some jumped to Wang's defense, others pointed out that this is often a familiar playbook used by influencers to absolve themselves of responsibility.  In April, former journalist and Web3 influencer Nicole Benham promoted the free mint of the Blocky Doge NFT collection, created by Dogecoin founder BillyM2K. As she hyped the collection on Twitter spaces, she also dumped 220 of the 250 Blocky Doge NFTs she owned. According to data from OpenSea, the collection’s average price lost half of its value in 24 hours.  After receiving backlash, Benham tweeted that she was “doing my best to rectify the situation,” though others doubted the authenticity of her apology.  In February, NFT collection Friendsies deleted its Twitter account, raising concerns that the project was a scam. In the process of uncovering details of the collection, Twitter users pointed fingers at Web3 show Rug Radio host Farokh and artist Jen Stark – who each have tens of thousands of followers – for their prior promotions of the project.  As with many other digital subcultures, NFT communities have flourished online and leading voices in the space have emerged. But oftentimes it feels as though the NFT space is particularly lawless, and influencers face little consequences for their actions that ultimately impact thousands.  Ultimately, the onus is on each individual collector to properly scope out a project before investing funds. Still, these familiar stories serve as a reminder that while you may feel you ""know"" an influencer, you rarely know their motivations and how well they've actually vetted a project.",NEGATIVE,ETH,DOGE | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/05/31/pixel-penguins-an-nft-charity-scam-shows-dangers-of-nft-influencer-culture,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97eb14724df42b338f53001e0d37bcf08defba0d-1226x888.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13066659,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535965,1685568600,XRP Breaks 2-Year Trendline: Is A 500x Surge On The Horizon?,"XRP, one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, has been bullish since May 26th, outperforming most of the top 10 cryptocurrencies. This surge in price comes as investors have high expectations for the outcome of the ongoing SEC vs. Ripple Labs case. Related Reading: Trader Joe Goes All-In On Auto-Pools: Game-Changer For DeFi Investors? XRP Shatters 2-Year Trendline The recent uptrend in XRP is particularly significant as the cryptocurrency has just broken through a two-year trendline, a key technical indicator for traders and investors, according to the trader Jaydee. Per the analysis of Jaydee, In 2017, XRP experienced a significant breakout when it surpassed a two-year trendline. This breakout led to a massive increase in value for the cryptocurrency, with XRP seeing a surge of 504x over just one year. This means that if an investor had purchased XRP at the start of 2017, they would have seen a return on investment of more than 50,000% by the end of the year. If XRP were to experience a similar surge in value today, with the cryptocurrency currently trading at $0.5116, it could reach a value of $258 by 2024. However, it’s important to note that predicting future price movements in cryptocurrency markets is highly challenging, and many factors could impact the value of XRP. For example, the ongoing SEC vs. Ripple Labs case could significantly impact the token’s future price movements. If the case is resolved in Ripple Labs’ favor, it could lead to increased adoption and investment in XRP. On the other hand, if the case is decided against Ripple Labs, it could lead to a decrease in demand for the cryptocurrency and a drop in its value. However, Jaydee believes that the cryptocurrency will not experience a surge of 504x shortly. According to the analyst, XRP’s market cap is too high to support such a significant increase in value. The token has a market cap of over $26 billion, making it the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Despite these uncertainties, many investors remain bullish on XRP’s prospects. The cryptocurrency has already seen significant adoption within the financial industry, with many major banks and payment processors using XRP for cross-border transactions. Key Indicators Point To Significant Growth Potential According to the Average Sentiment Oscillator (ASO), the current set-up for XRP is highly bullish, with several key indicators pointing toward a strong upward trend in price. One key factor contributing to this bullish sentiment is the high volatility of XRP’s market depth, indicating significant interest and demand for the cryptocurrency. Additionally, the current trend’s strength is strong, with a bullish cross indicating that XRP is likely to continue its upward trajectory, per a recent analysis by Egrag Crypto. While XRP has been ascending in the price for almost four months, there is still a major resistance level known by Egrag as the ‘Final Wake Up Line’ that XRP has yet to break through. However, even if the token experiences a minor correction after a 20% pump, there are still possible support levels at $0.4810 and $0.4277 that could prevent a significant drop in value, according to Egrag Crypto’s latest analysis.

If XRP does dip below these support levels, it is considered normal and not necessarily a cause for concern as long as it respects its below lines as strong support in the near term. This support box could act as a key area of stability for XRP, allowing it to continue its upward trend in price.

42410533,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfLjP,1685567535,What Is a Crypto Foundation?,"Crypto foundations are non-profit organizations created to support specific blockchains and related projects. They can foster community building and support decentralized control over a project. Though it may seem odd that an entity is responsible for a community-led project, foundations are a common practice in the industry.  Operating alongside the community and for-profit developers, crypto foundations have offered some significant benefits to blockchain projects, including assistance and assurance that a blockchain remains decentralized in its development. They also can provide marketing and education about the project to boost recognition and adoption.  While there are benefits to crypto foundations, some have recently looked more skeptically at the crypto foundation model and are questioning who the structure benefits. To provide context to crypto foundations, we’ll cover what crypto foundations do and why they exist.  What do crypto foundations do?  Despite the close relationship between foundations and blockchain ecosystems, foundations do not take an active role in developing or controlling the blockchain. Instead, foundations are primarily responsible for the continued growth and support of a blockchain, its related technology and support for the community.  The support offered by crypto foundations can come in the form of non-financial and financial support.  Non-financial support can include engaging with the community, creating connections for projects and hosting events. The Ethereum Foundation, for example, hosts the Devcon Conference and other Ethereum events for developers and researchers to learn more about Ethereum while connecting with other builders in the community.  While these foundations tend to invest and support ecosystem projects, this is not to be confused with the charity work done by traditional non-profits.  Instead, foundations are funding projects in a way more similar to the work of a traditional venture capital firm, granting funding to projects that will help the overall ecosystem around that blockchain. The Solana Foundation, for instance, offers investments through the Solana Foundation Grants program to “ initiatives aimed at decentralizing, growing, and securing the Solana network.” Crypto foundations can also be involved with non-grant funding or investments alongside traditional venture capital firms like a16z or Pantera Capital.  Why do crypto foundations exist?  Crypto foundations are designed to further the decentralization and evolution of a project. By providing support without direct involvement, crypto foundations ensure that the development of a blockchain is distributed across the community and not centralized by one single entity. Despite this ambitious goal, it’s unclear if foundations actually achieve decentralization.  Blockchains are not created in a void and some degree of centralization needs to occur for a project to launch. At launch, a for-profit entity is almost always the catalyst for the project’s creation. The foundation typically comes sometime after.  To illustrate, let’s take a look at Filecoin (FIL) and the Filecoin community. Protocol Labs is a for-profit, research and development lab specifically focused on developing decentralized storage solutions for Filecoin. Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web is a non-profit entity that provides guidance and support to projects looking to build within the Filecoin ecosystem. The same relationship exists among almost every other blockchain, like the Algorand Foundation (non-profit) and Algorand Inc (for-profit).  Debates around decentralization and crypto foundations arise when discussing the relationship between for-profit entities and non-profit foundations. Foundations are typically kicked off by for-profit entities and receive an allocation of tokens at the launch.  In the case of Polkadot (DOT), the Web3 Foundation received around 12% of the initial token supply, or 1.2M DOT. The amount of DOT was worth around $348K at the launch but has since exploded to over $7.5M today. This method of funding through token launches is not unique to Polkadot and happens with many other crypto foundations today.  The close relationship between foundations and for-profit entities has drawn skepticism beyond just crypto critics, but also the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and class action attorneys. In July 2022, a class action lawsuit was filed against both the Solana Foundation and Solana Labs alleging that the two entities violated the Securities Act by selling SOL tokens.  The lawsuit, and other similar actions taken against foundations, highlight another added benefit of having a crypto foundation: dodging securities liability.  For the purposes of evaluating whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security under US law, courts typically turn to the Howie Test. Under this test, the court will determine that a cryptocurrency is a security when it is:  An investment of money  In a common enterprise  With a reasonable expectation of profits  Derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.  If a cryptocurrency satisfies each of these four prongs in the Howey Test, then it may be considered to be a security under U.S. law. While the first three prongs may be true for nearly every cryptocurrency, the final prong of the test is what crypto foundations help to circumvent, though other ways such as DAOs (which may or may not be part of a foundation) or engaging proof-of-stake as the consensus mechanism are also used as proof of decentralization.  Foundations are responsible for the development and support of a blockchain but do so in passive or parallel ways. This decentralized approach to blockchain development has provided a pseudo-safe haven for developers to continue building without a token becoming a security. As long as there isn’t a centralized nature to the development, many believe that the blockchain’s underlying cryptocurrency cannot be considered a security.  Foundations serve as one key point in the argument that cryptocurrencies are exempt from securities law. To add an additional layer of protection from U.S.-based enforcement, these foundations are additionally created in Switzerland or other crypto-friendly countries.  Nonetheless, the only asset that the SEC has officially deemed to not be a security is Bitcoin, and ongoing debates in the U.S. over whether cryptocurrencies are securities or commodities are complex and time will tell if a blockchain having an associated foundation will factor in future decisions and regulations.",NEUTRAL,DOT | FIL | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | FIL | REGULATION | SOL,Griffin Mcshane,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-crypto-foundation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a6cb482af5271bc9dc933d6ff86dfe1c94e4396-2170x1381.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

We’d prefer giving you the bounty so we can focus on our protocol. Instead, we will deal with law enforcement to find you,” the Jimbos team wrote to the attacker on Twitter, after giving them several days to return 90% of the stolen funds. “The door remains open for the hacker to return the funds until they are arrested, at which point the offer will be rescinded.”  The recent move to work with the Department of Homeland Security comes three days after Jimbos faced a $7.5 million flash loan exploit and about two weeks after the protocol’s official launch date.  In addition to collaborating with law enforcement in the United States, the team is currently opening more cases in other jurisdictions and is offering a 10% bounty worth about $800,000 to the general public for anyone who provides information that leads to catching the exploiter and funds being returned.  “We have a good idea who it is,” said blockchain sleuth Ogle, who is part of the recovery process and has helped with the Euler Finance exploit. “I think they end up speaking, keeping their 10%, and returning the rest — it’s a win for everybody and makes the most sense.

While the company touts 4 distinct business models, 82% of the company's revenue comes from mining pools. BIT Mining continues to burn cash and crypto treasury management decisions raise concerns. When I last covered BIT Mining Limited ( BTCM ) in early September, it was just days before the long awaited transition of Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) from a Proof of Work to Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. In my article, I cautioned that 76% BIT Mining's self-mined crypto revenue came from Ethereum mining - revenue that would go away following the consensus mechanism change. After ""The Merge"" last September, BIT Mining Limited has had to adjust its self-mining approach. In this update, we'll look at the current status of BIT Mining's revenue segments and balance sheet following Q1 earnings. Full Revenue Picture Total Q1 revenue for BIT Mining Limited came in at $72.9 million. While this is up 19% over Q4, the company's Q1 performance represents a dramatic 75% decline in revenue year over year. This isn't necessarily unique to BIT Mining Limited as many crypto-related companies have seen drastic revenue declines over the last year or so. BIT Mining aims to have a diversified revenue generation model that includes mining pools, datacenter services, and miner manufacturing in addition to the company's self-mining segment. As expected last year, the self-mining portion of the revenue fell apart following The Merge falling from $7.1 million in Q3-22 to just $1.9 million the following quarter. At the end of Q1, crypto self-mining revenue came in at $6.2 million. This was up 226.3% sequentially but down nearly 73% from the year-over-year comp. Revenue from: Q1-22 Q2-22 Q3-22 Q4-22 Q1-23 QoQ YoY Self-mining $22.9 $14.8 $7.1 $1.9 $6.2 226.3% -72.9% Mining Pool $272.3 $178.5 $88.5 $53.9 $60.0 11.3% -78.0% Datacenter Services $1.5 $2.2 $1.4 $5.2 $5.9 13.5% 293.3% Source: BIT Mining Limited, millions Manufacturing revenue is a distant 4th place in terms of revenue segment rank and appears to have only accounted for $0.8 million to date. As of last quarter, datacenter services are the only meaningful area of growth for the company and it's a small percentage of revenue for the overall business. BIT Limited is still highly reliant on mining pool revenue as it makes up over 82% of the company's total figure. Though it should be noted that the company has reduced its reliance on mining pool revenue from 92% in Q1-22. In addition to losing the ETH mining revenue last year, the company also cited declines in crypto market prices as a cause for the reduction in crypto mining revenue as well. Due to the failing economics of the business, BIT Mining made the decision to suspend certain types of BTC mining rigs. For the quarter ended March 31st, BTCM was only able to mine 99 BTC with recognized revenue of $2.1 million. The majority of the company's mining revenue now comes from mining Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) and Litecoin ( LTC-USD ). Balance Sheet At the end of March, BIT Mining Limited had $40.2 million in current assets. This was up from $35.3 million at the end of 2022; however, the majority of that $4.9 million increase is from a $3.4 million revaluation in the company's cryptocurrency holdings. Cash declined from $5.4 million at the end of 2022 to $4.6 million at the end of March: BIT Mining Limited There was a bit of a rotation in the makeup of the crypto holdings as well. The company's crypto treasury is comprised of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), ETH, and DOGE: Holdings Q4-22 Q1-23 QoQ BTC 289 289 0.0% ETH 4,845 3,243 -33.1% DOGE 42,800,000 69,500,000 62.4% Source: BIT Mining Limited Quarter over quarter, the company didn't see any change in the BTC on the balance sheet. However, it did sell 1,602 ETH and grew DOGE holdings by nearly 27 million DOGE. This means roughly $5 million of BIT Mining Limited's $18 million in crypto holdings are allocated to a meme coin. The bigger head-scratcher though may be the decision to sell ETH when it is the only coin the company holds that can generate returns through staking. BIT Mining Limited From a liability standpoint, BIT Mining Limited cites $36 million in current liabilities and $39 million in total liabilities when adding lease obligations. Quarter over quarter shares outstanding grew a little over 4%. Risks There isn't much more information in the company's filings pertaining to liability details. We know BIT Mining Limited previously operated a lottery business before entering crypto mining in 2021. We also know the company has exactly one quarter of positive net income between 2016 and 2022: Data by YCharts This is not a company that has a history of generating positive earnings even when crypto was at all-time highs. Share dilution remains an ongoing concern. Summary BIT Mining Limited's mining pool and self-mining businesses are telling the tale. The broader trend for those segments is in decline. The opportunity in datacenters is interesting, but there will be quite a bit of competition in that space. Earlier in May, BIT Mining Limited announced a partnership with a company called Chain Reaction to producing BTC mining systems with a new ASIC chip that the companies describe as ""groundbreaking."" Though there were no specifics about production units and sales provided. Furthermore, the company's crypto treasury management decisions are odd from where I sit. While I've made it no secret that I think assets like Dogecoin don't have much a future, in my view the more egregious decision is selling the ETH on the balance sheet when the company could be generating rewards by staking it natively on-chain. It's difficult to understand why management would opt instead for holding meme coins rather than selling all DOGE production and staking Ethereum at virtually no cost. BTCM is still an avoid for me.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | ETH | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4608582-bit-mining-limited-selling-ethereum-holding-dogecoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13065988.jpeg

The bridge has processed 278 transactions in the past day, totaling around $2.6 million. It shows a sharp decrease in activity between Ethereum and Avalanche, among the world’s largest smart contract platforms. Related Reading: Trader Joe Goes All-In On Auto-Pools: Game-Changer For DeFi Investors? The Avalanche Bridge connects the Avalanche’s C-Chain, one of the three interoperable blockchains defining the low-finality platform, with Ethereum. Since C-Chain is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), assets can be smoothly transferred from Avalanche to Ethereum and vice versa. The compatibility with the EVM coupled with the decentralization of the bridge means users can move funds between the two blockchains securely. Avalanche, unlike Ethereum, is explicitly designed for decentralized finance (DeFi) dApps. It boasts high processing speeds, relatively low fees, and is decentralized. However, it lags Ethereum in activity, judging from the total value locked (TVL). According to DeFiLlama data, over $26.5 billion of the approximately $48 billion of all DeFi TVL is managed by dapps on Ethereum. More Assets Moved Between Avalanche And Bitcoin Notably, while there is a worrying contraction in the number of transactions and value between Avalanche and Ethereum, the Avalanche Core Bitcoin Bridge is booming. On May 31, there was a significant increase in transfers and value, with a spike of 2,726%. Within 24 hours, assets worth over $6.5 million were transferred through the bridge. This is roughly half the average weekly transfers which stand at $13.81. Bitcoin transferred to the Avalanche C-Chain from the Bitcoin network is tokenized and is compliant with the ERC-20 standard. In that case, it can be moved to Ethereum and used to participate in DeFi. Related Reading: Coinbase CEO Drops Bombshell Prediction – Is China Set To Dominate Crypto? Scanning the activities stemming from Avalanche to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the disparity could suggest that more users are moving their assets to and from Bitcoin. However, no direct fundamental event could explain why more users are bridging tokens from Bitcoin and cutting down engagement with Ethereum. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Avalanche prices have been under pressure, falling from recent highs. To illustrate, AVAX is down 6% from May 28 highs, extending losses from mid-April. AVAX is down 35% in the last six weeks and retesting March 2023 lows. AVAX may slip below a critical multi-week support level if sellers double down. In that case, it could drop to December 2022 lows at around $10.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) officially declared his candidacy last week, though he appears to have been laying the groundwork (campaigning) for quite some time. Crypto hasn’t been an issue in any previous presidential election, and barely popped its head up during the last few midterms. But as CoinDesk prepares to cover the next roughly 18 months, it looks increasingly likely that this industry will pop its head up.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  525 days  The narrative  Election season has kicked off. And now is your chance to help CoinDesk better cover this.  Why it matters  The cliche here is that the next president and Congress will have an important role to play in the regulatory efforts around crypto. That’s true, that’s been true for the current Congressional session and that was true for the last one as well. Still, let’s take a look at what that might look like.  By the way, it’s not just the U.S. that’s holding elections – over the next year and a half, we’ll see elections in India, Bangladesh, Belarus, Finland, Indonesia, Mauritania, Mexico, South Africa and possibly the U.K. Crypto may become an issue voters in some of these other jurisdictions also care about.  Breaking it down  The Iowa caucus kicks off primary voting in February 2024, which is roughly nine months from now. There's over 500 days before the Nov. 5, 2024 election. So naturally the upcoming election season is in full swing.  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced his intention to run for president, something that has long been hinted at for a number of months. He joins a crowded field including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Nikki Haley, Tim Scott and several other people. In his announcement on Twitter Spaces, DeSantis reiterated his anti-central bank digital currency (CDBC) stance in response to a question. The substance of his response is not as interesting as the fact that – right now at least – this is an actual topic of discussion during the campaign.  CoinDesk intends to cover the 2024 election, more comprehensively than we did in 2022. This includes the presidential, other federal and state elections – after all, despite much of the industry’s attention being focused on Congress, most of the legislation actually enacted that addresses crypto has happened at the state level in places like New York and Texas.  My question for this newsletter’s readers is which issues do you see as being most important, and which issues are you paying attention to over the next 18 months?  Are these crypto-specific issues like crypto legislation and the idea of central bank digital currencies? Are they adjacent issues like privacy and the right to transact? Are they broader issues like individual liberties and digital freedoms?  There's also, of course, the natural push and pull between policy and politics. Will crypto get eaten up as a political issue? Or will we see a robust and substantive discussion of the actual policy and regulatory questions?  Outside the U.S., it’s a bit less clear to me whether crypto will be even a blip on the radar for elections. Certainly the industry may have views and positions in places like India, which enacted steep taxes on crypto transactions, or the U.K., which is experimenting with crypto-specific legislation.  Will that be enough to make crypto or crypto-adjacent topics a campaign issue?  Respond to this email or weigh in on the State of Crypto Telegram group if you have thoughts!

42410535,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfLq1,1685564660,"Welcome, Crypto, to the Fiery Cauldron of U.S. Presidential Politics","Whether the crypto industry wants the spotlight or not, digital assets are among the earliest talking points in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, with the most prominent of the new candidates even invoking bitcoins in his campaign opener as evidence of President Joe Biden’s missteps.  In an election in which the heaviest fireworks will likely be seen on the side of the Republican challengers, former President Donald Trump – occupying the role as Biden’s leading nemesis – is himself facing an early-days threat from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who immediately staked out crypto as a kind of political shorthand.  “The current regime, clearly, has it out for Bitcoin,” DeSantis said from his campaign’s Twitter Spaces launch pad, using crypto to represent innovation and personal freedom. “Bitcoin represents a threat to them, they’re trying to regulate it out of existence.”  If digital assets keep figuring into presidential politics, they’ll likely feature as a stand-in to illustrate the perceived abuses of the federal government, according to industry insiders and political experts. But the attention may not contribute to the policy progress crypto businesses crave, because the sector is waiting for comprehensive rules, not political sentiments.  So far, Biden’s administration is being accused of squeezing emerging crypto businesses and trying to set up a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to spy on citizens, according to DeSantis and one of Biden’s challengers from his own party, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.  For DeSantis, his pro-crypto position also separates him from chief rival Trump. The digital assets views of the Republican frontrunner for the 2024 nomination have historically been rooted in distrust, with Trump having declared in 2019 that he was “not a fan” of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, “whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.” However, more recently Trump profited from his own series of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), so his position remains murky.  Two weeks before DeSantis opened his campaign beside tech mogul Elon Musk, he sought to make a political moment out of his state’s “ban” of a U.S. CBDC. Experts in the commercial law Florida used to act against a potential digital dollar have said Florida’s effort isn’t a ban at all, but that might not matter for political supporters impressed by DeSantis’ zeal.  “He seems to understand that private solutions being developed in the crypto markets are likely to be superior, in part because they pose fewer risks to the individual liberty of the public,” said Dave Weisberger, CEO of CoinRoutes, a trading tech startup in DeSantis’ home state.  But DeSantis is generally vague about his defense of cryptocurrencies, and his remarks don’t seem to acknowledge they are online instruments that can operate outside the whims of sovereign states. When he says that Democrats – given another four years – will “probably end up killing it,” it seems to suggest the U.S. lawmakers would have more reach than they do, and that crypto won’t find homes in other global jurisdictions, such as in Europe.  “It’s more about how he’s trying to paint himself as a fresh face,” said Ron Hammond, director of government relations for the Blockchain Association in Washington. “He’s trying to say ‘I’m the younger gun here who’s trying to get something done.’”  In the know  A rival Republican candidate, Vivek Ramaswamy, has argued the Florida governor doesn’t know the topic well. The biotech entrepreneur told CoinDesk he’s pro-Bitcoin because he sees it as a “decentralized alternative” to the U.S dollar, improving the country’s financial infrastructure by presenting “a source of competition to the existing system.” And he says he understands it much more than DeSantis.  Other notable Republican candidates, such as Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and his state’s former governor, Nikki Haley, have reserved comment on the financial movement. Despite his position on the Senate Banking Committee that could help decide U.S. crypto’s fate, Scott has taken the most neutral possible stance, saying lawmakers should take a “thoughtful, bipartisan and balanced approach” to overseeing the industry in the U.S.  Among the Democratic challengers to standard-bearer Biden, Kennedy – who also holds other views that overlap with Republican positions – is fervently pro-crypto.  “Cryptocurrencies, led by bitcoin, along with other crypto technologies are a major innovation engine,” Kennedy wrote in a tweet earlier this month. “It is a mistake for the U.S. government to hobble the industry and drive innovation elsewhere.”  The most popular of the pro-crypto candidates among voters, DeSantis, still trails well behind Trump in primary polling, but the fact that there are multiple candidates saying nice things about digital assets is a positive for some in the sector.  “We now have three presidential candidates, spanning both political parties, who explicitly support the digital asset industry,” CoinRoutes’ Weisberger said. “While Republicans are trying to make crypto a partisan issue, the industry itself doesn’t believe it should be, which is why the support from RFK Jr. is also potentially important.”  Biden is the only candidate with a federal record on digital assets. So far, his administration hasn’t set down any significant crypto policy, and the financial regulators he picked have taken a staunchly critical view of the industry. His Securities and Exchange Commission chief, Gary Gensler, may be the most antagonistic of the bunch, combating digital assets businesses in courtrooms and with his agency’s rule proposals. And the direct messages from Biden’s Department of the Treasury and his own White House have been increasingly suspicious of the industry.  Though it wasn’t a campaign remark, Biden, who last month formally announced his effort to stay in the White House another four years, made a crypto jab on Twitter that wealthy investors are dodging taxes. But unlike the social-media presence of a politician such as Trump, it’s unclear how directly involved Biden is with his messaging.  CBDC punching bag  Despite Biden’s administration keeping itself in study-only mode on CBDCs and not yet taking a position on whether the U.S. should have such a thing, the issue has so far become the sharpest political tool in the early presidential contest.  DeSantis accused the White House of pushing for a digital dollar that could not only become a tool of government surveillance but also a financial weapon for direct intervention against political enemies. U.S. Republicans have taken up the grievances of truckers in Canada as the cautionary tale of government run amok, because authorities there locked up the crypto wallets of truck drivers who led protests against Covid-19 related travel restrictions. DeSantis and other U.S. politicians say the Canadian actions could be repeated here.  “There is a degree of fearmongering happening with the CBDC to frame it as another way that the big, bad, scary government is looking to control your daily lives and track you,” said Owen Tedford, an analyst at Beacon Policy Advisors. “So the opposition for these Republicans has little to do with fundamentals, nor is it necessarily based in fact since there is no CBDC, yet.”  Criticizing the non-existent digital dollar is getting increasingly popular and has spawned a number of legislative efforts to stop a CBDC before it starts. Political observers expect the fight – so far one-sided – will keep showing up on the presidential campaign trail.  “I think CBDC is going to be coming up a lot more,” said Hammond of the Blockchain Association, who added that the issue has a ton of points the Republicans can find drama in, from its big-government implications to the fact that the chief global rival of the U.S. has already started down that road. “It’s a combination of China, privacy and mistrust in government.”  The crypto factor  Apart from the question of government-issued assets, most don’t think cryptocurrencies will weigh heavily in the election.  “I don't expect crypto to end up factoring much in the 2020 race unless there is a large market boom or another FTX-scale industry implosion,” said Tedford at Beacon. “I think candidates are more using it as a tool to demonstrate other points.”  Hammond agreed that the sector is not likely to play a significant role.  “I could see it coming up occasionally, but it’s not going to be a stump speech,” he said.  But Perianne Boring, who heads the Chamber of Digital Commerce, said the topic’s prominence might depend on who survives the primaries.  “Given how active the Biden administration has been with crypto, I would assume it would come up in debates,” she said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/31/welcome-crypto-to-the-fiery-cauldron-of-us-presidential-politics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16686b0ab2d05a79c29a354935e6d28aa9e661d7-2880x1620.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The traditional finance giant is bringing crypto to more institutional investors during a prolonged bear market and after a number of headline-grabbing scandals rocked the industry.  “While the crypto-native landscape still feels a little somber, when we look at our traditional client base and we look at the relationships we’ve been developing, it actually feels reasonably optimistic,"" Simon Forster, global co-head of Digital Assets at TP ICAP Group, told CoinDesk. ""There’s a lot of people building interesting things. And it feels like 2022 is this watershed moment where the crypto landscape has changed we think probably forever.""  Traditional finance-tailored companies need to have strict governance and regulatory structures in place before offering any service to investors, which makes the launch of a new marketplace a long and difficult process. TP ICAP aims to offer infrastructure that looks more familiar to institutional investors than what’s offered by vertically-integrated crypto exchanges that combine their exchange, custody and other businesses and create potential conflicts of interest, explained Forster.  Fusion Digital Assets has a partitioned operational structure that includes TP ICAP’s Fusion electronic trading platform that provides the non-custodial crypto exchange, Fidelity’s Digital Assets SM as the custodian that holds and settles client assets, and an aggregation of liquidity sources including Flow Traders and XBTO Global. TP ICAP plans to bring on additional custodians in the future to provide more options for investors.  The first trade was a bitcoin-U.S. dollar (XBTUSD) pairs trade. The marketplace currently supports trading in bitcoin and ether (ETH) against USD, but the firm is open to expanding the assets it supports according to client demand.  TP ICAP’s Digital Assets arm has existed since 2019. Three years later, TP ICAP announced it would offer clients the ability to trade crypto-linked exchange-traded products (ETPs). The company gained its UK crypto license in December after registering with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), meaning the new Fusion Digital Marketplace is open to traders in the region. The firm plans to add additional supported regions as regulatory approvals permit, said Forster.",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/31/tradfi-giant-tp-icap-brings-crypto-spot-trading-to-institutional-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a0ad4b3938c182b36512fd927c52130530e2157-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410539,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfM6Y,1685562589,"Inflation Concerns, Strong Jobs Data Put Bitcoin on the Defensive","The price of bitcoin (BTC) retreated on Wednesday after a Federal Reserve official reiterated her concerns about jobs data and inflation.  “I don’t really see a compelling reason to pause, meaning wait until you get more evidence to decide what to do,” said Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester in an interview with the Financial Times.  Despite some encouraging signs in recent months, said Mester, the Fed had more work to do to stem inflation.  Mester is an Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) “alternate member,” meaning that she votes on interest rates in the absence of one of the 12 voting members. Known as one of the more hawkish members of the Fed, her comments shouldn't have been too surprising, but nevertheless helped knock the price of bitcoin down about $500 to $27,000 early Wednesday morning.  Meanwhile, an unexpectedly strong Job Openings and Labor Turnover (JOLTS) report showed openings increasing to 10.1 million in April, more than an anticipated 9.375 million, and bolstering Mester’s argument that labor markets remain stubbornly tight.  Not all market participants have been phased by the price decline.  Mikkel Morch, of Digital Asset Fund Ark36 believes that the fundamental drivers of bitcoin, including adoption and institutional interest, point to higher prices despite current macroeconomic concerns.  “While short-term volatility persists due to the Federal Reserve's tightening measures and ongoing global economic uncertainties, our stance at ARK36 remains bullish on Bitcoin for the long term”, stated Morch.  Michael Silberberg of crypto hedge fund Alt Tab Capital, echoed those sentiments, indicating that institutional investors often embrace volatility in crypto markets. “This is a highly volatile market,"" he said, ""which is one of the traits that attracts institutional investors in the first place.”  A key to watch in upcoming days is to what extent BTC prices settle near $27,000, which coincides with its 20-day moving average. A decline below this threshold could see bitcoin approach the lower range of its Bollinger Band at $26,300.  Among upcoming data points of interest will be Friday’s nonfarm payrolls data.

According to its website, Fewos are characters in Fewoworld, Fewocious’ Web3 universe of digital art. The three species of Fewo NFTs – Frankenstein, Misunderstood, and Humanoid – have their own unique artistic traits. There are no details on the price of the NFTs at this time.  “From squiggly eyes, to linework bones, and everything in between, these creatures were born from the mind of FEWOCiOUS, with every trait hand drawn and then converted into beautiful 3D art,” the website explains.  While the mint will open for public sale later in the summer, there will be a presale for holders of Fewocious’ previous Paint Drop collection, as well as holders of other Fewocious digital art tokens.  The site specifies that each Fewo comes with a ERC-6551, meaning the token can transform into a wallet. The wallet will be used to claim a mint pass for FewoFashion, a collection of digital wearables and accessories.  Fewocious, who’s real name is Victor Langlois, has risen to the ranks as one of the most successful NFT artists to date.

Despite attestations claiming a $2.4 billion surplus, some question Tether's ability to meet all redemption obligations in a run situation. In my view, Tether is too reliant on Tron for scaling its token supply. One of the most polarizing cryptocurrencies in the entire industry is the stablecoin Tether ( USDT-USD ). With a market capitalization of over $83 billion, USDT is the third-largest crypto coin after Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). The coin is designed to maintain a 1 for 1 peg with the US Dollar and is used for DEX trading and on-chain lending protocols. One of the big reasons why Tether has been polarizing is due to questions regarding what and where the coin's issuer holds collateral for the token's backing. Types of Stablecoins There are essentially three different types of stablecoins that have had market success to this point: Algorithmic Crypto-collateralized Fiat-collateralized Algorithmic coins are unique because the backing of those coins could be considered the code rather than actual assets. That code is designed to adjust the supply of the tokens outstanding depending on demand thresholds for the coin. Developers of coins like this aim for a mechanism that maintains a stable peg. This doesn't always work well, and the most relevant example of an algorithmic stablecoin is probably UST, which notoriously collapsed in May 2022 when Terra Luna ( LUNC-USD ) melted down. Crypto-collateralized coins generally have overcollateralized backing from one or several cryptocurrencies. Maker's DAI ( DAI-USD ) is the most notable example of a crypto-collateralized coin and has a 190% collateralization ratio backed by Ethereum and a handful of other tokens. A recently launched algorithmic stablecoin on Cardano ( ADA-USD ) aims for a 400% collateralization rate. The fiat-collateralized coins are theoretically the safest because they're minted by a central issuer when a user deposits real dollars with that issuer. Circle's USD Coin ( USDC-USD ) and Paxos Trust ( BUSD-USD ) are good examples of fiat-backed stablecoins. Tether is the biggest fiat-backed stable coin. The Stablecoin Market The fiat-backed coins are by far the preference from major market participants, judging by the size of the circulating supply. According to data from DeFi Llama, just under 94% of the $129.3 billion in total stablecoin market capitalization is from fiat-backed coins. Tether is a fiat-backed stablecoin, but it has generally carried a bit more skepticism than some of the other large fiat-stablecoin peers like USDC due to what many believe to be poor transparency regarding what is backing the USDT in circulation. Stablecoin Market (DeFi Llama) Despite that skepticism, Tether has bucked the recent redemption trend in the USD-denominated stablecoin market and has actually seen a roughly 25% increase in supply (green line) while USDC (blue line) and BUSD (yellow line) have seen heavy redemptions since the FTX ( FTT-USD ) collapse. This dynamic intensified in March when USDC and DAI briefly lost their pegs following the banking problems in the traditional finance industry while Tether actually traded slightly above $1: TradingView Tether notably did not see a de-pegging in Mid-March, when USDC and DAI briefly fell by more than 10%. DAI's peg went lower because USDC is one of the assets that DAI uses as collateral. USDC lost its peg because it had exposure to Silicon Valley Bank (SIVBQ). A small portion of the collateral that was used as backing for the USDC supply in circulation was held with SVB, and there were questions about how Circle would be able to manage a run on USDC. Tether Collateral Even though it didn't lose its peg in March, there have been several red flags pointed out about Tether through the years from independent analysts and financial journalists. Those red flags have led to claims that Tether is either an offshore hedge fund with more exposure to risk than competing stable issuers at best or an alleged fraud at worst. Earlier this year, Forbes reported Tether's collateral was held with Cantor Fitzgerald, Capital Union, and Ansbacher. The latter two are Bahamas-based banks. In Tether's most recent quarterly attestation , the company claimed $81.8 billion in total assets backing $79.4 billion in liabilities as of May 9th: Asset Breakdown (Tether) Roughly 65% of those assets are held in US Treasuries and just under 2% is held in Bitcoin. Tether claims to have an asset surplus of a little over $2.4 billion. Where is the USDT? Beyond the questions about what exactly Tether the company is holding as collateral and where that collateral is being held, a clear risk that I personally see regarding Tether the coin is that more than half of the USDT in circulation is on the Tron ( TRX-USD ) blockchain: Circulating USDT (DeFi Llama) Like Tether, Tron is a somewhat controversial topic within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Tron was started by crypto whale Justin Sun back in 2017. More recently, the SEC sued both Justin Sun and the Tron Foundation for a variety of alleged infractions; including selling unregistered securities and participating in manipulative trading. In the past, reports from third-party data analysts have speculated that as much as 84% of the activity on Tron has been from wash trading. TVL Rank Network Protocols Total Stables Top Stable 1 Ethereum 805 $69.23b USDT:48.22% 2 Tron 22 $45.15b USDT:94.82% 3 Binance 605 $5.68b USDT:59.56% 4 Arbitrum 341 $1.86b USDC:62.95% 5 Polygon 424 $1.52b USDT:44.62% Source: DeFi Llama From a DeFi standpoint, Tron is among the most concentrated blockchains in the entire cryptocurrency industry with just 22 protocols, reliance on the top protocol for 65% of total chain TVL, and a stablecoin footprint that is 95% dominated by USDT. In my opinion, Tether and Tron are highly reliant on each other. If there is ever a serious failure or stoppage of the Tron blockchain, redemption of the $43 billion USDT on that network could become challenging. Bitcoin Backing Like other stablecoins in the crypto market, Tether does have some collateral backing to Bitcoin. In mid-May , Tether announced it would be adding to that Bitcoin position by using up to 15% of operating profit to buy additional BTC for collateral backing. Tether's CTO Paolo Ardoino said the following: Our investment in Bitcoin is not only a way to enhance the performance of our portfolio, but it is also a method of aligning ourselves with a transformative technology. This alignment with Bitcoin apparently isn't just limited to holding more BTC in reserve. In late May , Tether announced it would begin putting resources to work in the Bitcoin mining sector in Uruguay. The company chose this location due to its 94% reliance on renewable energy. Summary Tether remains one of the great mysteries in the crypto market. Many have wondered very openly if the company actually has enough liquid collateral to meet redemptions if the token were to experience a run on assets. Even if you take the view that Tether's balance sheet is structured as the company says it is, I believe there are still several valid reasons to avoid USDT anyway. First, Tether's issuance and redemption are through a centralized, offshore entity. Like Circle, Tether has the power to freeze assets or ban usage at the wallet address level and has done so to a larger degree than USDC: Banned Addresses (Dune Analytics/KARTOD) Furthermore, fiat-backed cryptocurrencies introduce traditional finance industry risk to an ecosystem that is built to disrupt traditional finance. When exposed to USDT, the holder has exposure to the blockchain network and its validators, the centralized entity that mints and redeems the tokens, the custodian of the collateral for that centralized entity, and then the collateral itself. There are other stablecoin projects that are instead overcollateralized by blue-chip cryptocurrencies and the backing is verifiable on-chain. I think those are much better options for on-chain swaps and DeFi lending.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDT | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | USDT | USDC,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4608559-tether-too-many-risks?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13064519.jpeg

13064250,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535960,1685559795,Why This Is The Most Important Bitcoin Chart You’ll See This Week,"Bitcoin price action is at an impasse. Bulls and bears are divided as to what happens next, leading to months of consolidation. It could all come down to the next few days, according to the most important BTCUSD price chart you’ll see this week. The chart shows just how critical the stalemate in crypto markets is currently, and why this week could be the end of the indecision. Bitcoin Momentum Takes A Pause, But What’s Next? In technical analysis, the velocity of price increases or decreases can be measured by momentum. Various tools exist that get the job done, including the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator. The tool is designed to give overbought and oversold signals, plus buy and sell signals based on crossovers of the signal and MACD lines. Passing through the zero line is also an indication of momentum strengthening, as well as the underlying trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Double Fractal Points To “Extended” Parabolic Rally It is for all these reasons and more that the chart below is so important. The chart consists of BTCUSD on the one-week timeframe. Underneath the price action is the LMACD – a logarithmic version of the MACD. The log version allows more comparative analysis between long-term cycles. At just a glance, it is easy to see that the tool appears ready to cross downward, generating a sell signal. The inflection point is visible in the LMACD | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Below The Zero Line: Doom Or Redemption? What’s worse is the fact the sell signal will occur alongside a failure to hold above the zero line on the LMACD. Such a sign of momentum failure would more than likely lead to a retest of current bear market lows across crypto. However, the D in the indicator’s name stands for “divergence.” Signals are generated based on the tool converging or diverging. Diverging upward in Bitcoin, could send the crypto market blasting off higher instead. Related Reading: Down But Not Out: The One Line Bitcoin Must Hold To Be Bullish But beware. It is possible that both situations could happen before the week’s end. The LMACD could cross down and turn the histogram red for the first time in 2023 and shake out those eager to jump the gun on the sell signal. After the shakeout, the tool could diverge up before close and continue to push momentum and price to new highs. Alternatively, the tool could diverge upward at this inflection point, only to later cross back down. What is for certain is that the current lack of a decision in price direction is about to end, according to the LMACD. Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

42410531,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfLcn,1685558829,The PulseChain Sideshow Tent Is Collapsing,"One of the perverse truisms of crypto is that for a certain kind of founder, the clearest path to success is to never actually build anything. Token presales incentivize infinite delay because you can cash in so effectively on grandiose promises – and the reality of what you create is always going to fall short of those fantasies.  Backers of Richard Heart (aka Richard James Schueler), longtime crypto raconteur and leader of the Hex and PulseChain projects, have spent the past two weeks learning that the hard way. PulseChain and PulseX, essentially a clone of the Ethereum smart-contract platform and the Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX), had been eagerly anticipated by investors – sorry, “sacrificers” – for years by the time they launched this month. And yea, there was much rejoicing.  But in the weeks since PulseChain’s May 13 launch, as laid out by Protos, the system has seized up and failed in a variety of ways. That included high fees, despite the entire rationale for the PulseChain project being essentially “Ethereum, but with lower fees.” After Protos published its analysis, another devastating bug was discovered which is thought to have robbed liquidity providers on the PulseX DEX of millions of dollars’ worth of fees. In another index of how busted the economics of the system are, wrapped bitcoin briefly spiked to $70,000 per token on PulseX, more than twice its open market price.  Meanwhile, the price of related assets including HEX, PLS and PLSX have sold off aggressively since launch, dropping on the order of 30% or more in the days since PulseChain launched.  Some version of this comical catastrophe was easily predictable. PulseChain, you see, isn’t just a fork of the Ethereum code, but was pitched as a copy of the Ethereum state. That is, it includes all wallet balances and assets as they existed on Ethereum, apparently as of the mid-May launch. Numerous critics over the years have pointed out that this ignores the vast number of dependencies behind these Ethereum assets, which would break in a dazzling variety of ways if cloned. A simple example would be stablecoins like USDC that are backed by reserve assets. Clones of such assets on PulseChain have no backing, and hence no actual value.  PulseChain’s most devoted critic is blockchain researcher Eric Wall, who recently referred to PulseChain as part of “bizarro crypto world.” While it’s difficult to be specific about what makes something Bizarro Crypto, it’s a hugely useful label.  On the one hand, you have the likes of Ethereum and Bitcoin and Uniswap and Filecoin, things that more or less work as intended. Then you have projects that look a lot like the real thing, but are inverted or compromised in crucial ways – the same way DC Comics’ Bizarro represents the inverse shadow-self of Superman. The differences that mark out Bizarro Crypto can be far more subtle and arcane, though, sometimes only visible to those of us who have, as the saying goes, seen too much.  One thing I’ve definitely seen too much of is Richard Heart’s backside. His specific brand of carnival-barker shtick centers around four things: track suits, gold chains, cars and twerking. He has made vulgar displays of his poor taste and apparently vast wealth – wealth largely harvested from Hex and Pulse investors – the defining characteristic of his online persona.  See also: The Trash Moat: When the Media Lies About Crypto | Opinion  Perversely, this is one of the reasons you may not have heard much about Hex or PulseChain. Heart’s absurd persona seems calculated to keep his projects firmly in Bizarro Crypto World, beneath serious attention. It’s the tactical equivalent of misspellings in deceptive emails, which security experts say are intentionally included to scare off people with good critical thinking skills. By selecting his own pool of credulous (and possibly vulnerable) investors, Heart has created a parallel universe where he is viewed as some mix of Satoshi Nakamoto, Vitalik Buterin and Tai Lopez. (Because, you know, Lambos prove you're smart).  That kind of parallel universe can, it seems clear, be very seductive. But eventually, Bizarro Crypto does have to come face to face with the real thing – and that rarely goes well.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,David Z.

The Circle Reserve Fund, managed by global investment giant BlackRock, held all of its $24 billion of assets under management in overnight repurchase (repo) agreements as of May 30, according to the fund’s website.  This is a significant change since the end of April, when the fund held more than $30 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds, according to Circle’s monthly attestation. The last Treasury bond worth $4 billion among the fund’s holdings matured on Tuesday, the fund’s website showed.  The milestone is a result of Circle’s attempt to protect the $29 billion USDC stablecoin from potential turbulence on the bond market while U.S. lawmakers are scrambling for a deal to avert a government default.

According to the DeFi researcher Tindorr, this innovative solution offers a set-and-forget yield farming strategy for liquidity providers (LPs), eliminating laborious position management. Auto-Pools allows LPs to provide liquidity to multiple assets through Liquidity Books, with strategies built and hosted off-chain by the Trader Joe’s team in a “Black Box”. The scalability and adjustability of Auto-Pools make it a simple yet smart move by Trader Joe’s to outperform other emerging DEXs and ignite bullish sentiment for $JOE. Related Reading: Coinbase CEO Drops Bombshell Prediction – Is China Set To Dominate Crypto? Can Trader Joe’s Auto-Pools Ignite Bullish Sentiment? The combination of Liquidity Book and Auto-Pools provides capital efficiency and the best user experience approach for new DeFi users, attracting more liquidity to the protocol. With the current size of Trader Joe, it has a niche to capitalize on untapped areas in the DeFi market. While competitors are entering the market, being a first mover gives Trader Joe’s an advantage, with the main challenges for new protocols being liquidity and real usage. For LPs, the first Auto-Pool called “The General” will launch soon, automatically rebalancing and auto-compounding all associated fees and rewards. By staking $JOE, users can get $JOE and earn protocol revenue generated, with a significant Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of 22.7%. The staked $JOE increased by 2x in just one week, indicating a strong bullish sentiment towards the token. DeFi researcher Tindorr believes that Trader Joe’s Auto-Pools have the potential to revolutionize the DeFi market. When trading within one bin, the one-click yield farming solution with zero-slippage trading could be a game-changer for DeFi investors seeking a solid product-market fit. Furthermore, hosting the strategies off-chain gives Trader Joe’s a double-edged sword, with the ability to be highly scalable and dynamically adjustable but also requiring users’ trust in the “Black Box” execution. Overall, Trader Joe’s Auto-Pools represents a pivotal moment for the DEX to outperform its competitors and attract more liquidity to the protocol. With its niche in untapped areas of the DeFi market, the combination of Liquidity Book and Auto-Pools offers capital efficiency and the best UX approach for new DeFi users. The first Auto-Pool, “The General,” is set to launch soon, and with the increasing staked $JOE and high APR, it’s worth keeping an eye on Trader Joe’s future growth. Trader Joe And WOO Network Partner Up For A Revolutionary Omnichain Ecosystem Trader Joe and WOO Network have announced a strategic collaboration to strengthen the liquidity of the WOO token on Arbitrum and to expedite growth towards a joint vision of a unified, omnichain future. Per the announcement, this partnership brings together both platforms’ resources and innovative capabilities to enhance market presence and drive innovation in the DeFi space. As part of the collaboration, WOO traders and liquidity providers can now trade and earn WOO on Trader Joe’s decentralized exchange through the Liquidity Book, one of the most capital-efficient automated market makers (AMMs) in DeFi. Liquidity Book offers zero-slippage swaps and provides liquidity providers unparalleled ease and flexibility in deployment and management, making it an ideal tool to help boost WOO to new heights.

""We consider this latest action by the OSC to be ungrounded,"" a Binance spokesperson told Seeking Alpha in an emailed statement. ""The OSC has made a request to access virtually limitless private data in the hope they may find something untoward."" Binance in early 2022 struck a deal with the regulator ""committing to several actions, including restricting Ontario users and providing quarterly reporting to the OSC. Since signing this agreement, Binance has diligently fulfilled its terms."" Over the last few years, Binance has come under increased regulatory scrutiny, having most recently been sued by the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trade Commission for allegedly violating certain trading and derivatives rules, a move that briefly roiled crypto prices. In March, a handful of U.S. senators called on Binance to disclose its finances and raised doubts over its regulatory compliance . The regulatory clampdown on crypto combined with a lingering market downturn has resulted in a notable drop in Binance's still-dominant market share.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) cited the rampant use of cryptocurrency in the Chinese fentanyl trade during a Wednesday Senate hearing, arguing for legislation to help break that pipeline.  The prominent member of the Senate Banking Committee referred to data from research firm Elliptic that revealed more than 90 Chinese businesses offering to ship fentanyl precursors, with almost all of them taking crypto in exchange.  “Unfortunately, that is a mode that some of these precursor manufacturers and illicit drug organizations have used – the receipt of bitcoin payments in wallets, cryptocurrency wallets,” said Elizabeth Rosenberg, the U.S. Treasury Department’s assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes, in testimony during the panel’s hearing.  “The reason why they would find this appealing is the same reason that other financial criminals would find it appealing, which is to say there's an element of pseudonymity that they seek,” Rosenberg said.  U.S. overdoses involving fentanyl have become the leading killer for those aged 18-45. The chemicals used to manufacture the dangerous drug often come from China and wind their way across multiple borders on their path to U.S. users of the synthetic opioid, which the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) says is 100 times more potent than morphine.  Warren suggested her Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act may help cut off the crypto payments, and she said the bill will be reintroduced in this Congress.  “Crypto is helping fund the fentanyl trade, and we have the power to shut that down,” Warren said. “It's time.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/31/us-sen-elizabeth-warren-calls-for-shutdown-of-crypto-funding-for-fentanyl,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b7d60811476cec2c3cd3627218d05bf2eed9f8b-2880x1620.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13062175,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535917,1685552414,Coinbase CEO Drops Bombshell Prediction – Is China Set To Dominate Crypto?,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has warned that the US risks ceding its global financial leadership and innovation hub status if it fails to recognize the transformative potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. In a recent interview with Market Watch, Armstrong urged policymakers and regulators to provide regulatory clarity to ensure consumer protection and realize the promise of crypto. Armstrong further claimed: By enforcing restrictive policies, the U.S. is inadvertently driving crypto-innovation offshore. That shift will compromise America’s legacy of pioneering technological advancements, and weaken our national security posture. Brian Armstrong Warns U.S. Could Lose To China The Coinbase CEO emphasized that currency has always embodied innovation, from the earliest coins as physical stores of value that transitioned the human race from bartering to commerce to the advent of portable paper currency that bolstered lending and investments. Related Reading: Indian Banks Urged To Embrace AI And Blockchain For Future Readiness Armstrong also notes that the technologically driven financial system of the 20th century, which was characterized by innovations such as credit cards, electronic transfers, and online banking, helped to make it the “American Century” – a period of US economic and political dominance. This highlights the importance of technological innovation in driving economic progress and global influence and suggests that the US must continue to lead in this area to maintain its position as a global economic leader. However, Coinbase CEO suggests that now the US and other democratic nations are up against digital systems promoted by an ambitious adversary, China. Armstrong revealed that China is promoting two Chinese tech behemoths, Alipay and Tencent, which offer integrated payment systems with direct, instant access to an array of services. With the recent launch of its digital yuan, China aims to directly challenge the US dollar and its role in global commerce. Given these moves and China’s strategy to leverage financial technology to protect its national interests, Hong Kong is positioning itself as a global crypto hub. Coinbase CEO Urges US Congress To Seize Historic Opportunity Armstrong put forward that smart and bespoke regulation in the 1990s and early 2000s enabled the US to define the Internet Age. And just like then, now is the time for Congress to seize the historic opportunity presented by crypto, pass comprehensive legislation that safeguards consumers, and fosters innovation. Moreover, he stressed that crypto has the potential to play a significant part in stimulating the American economy and promoting democratic values worldwide. “If the US falls short today, the next generation of Americans will pay the price,” the CEO said. Furthermore, Armstrong warned that if the US fails to recognize the transformative potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, it risks ceding its global financial leadership and innovation hub status to other countries. Bringing crypto and blockchain innovation back to the US a decade from now will require a colossal and sustained effort that may not succeed. Therefore, Armstrong urged policymakers and regulators to work together to modernize the financial system and reaffirm the country’s role as a global technology leader rather than abdicating it. Related Reading: Optimism Crashes 33% Following Token Unlocks, Why There Could Be More Pain To Come He also acknowledged that traditional financial capitals, including the UK, United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Japan, the European Union, Australia, and Singapore, are also vying to become crypto hubs. He argued that the nexus between financial technologies and democratic values is integral to America’s identity. It’s why he decided to base Coinbase in the US. Overall, Armstrong highlights the potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency to revolutionize the financial system and other sectors, and the importance of the US in fostering innovation in this space. By providing regulatory clarity, he believes the US can safeguard consumers, stimulate the economy, and maintain its position as a global financial leader and innovation hub.

42410530,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfLZU,1685552303,A House Bill Would Make It Harder for the SEC to Argue Crypto Tokens Are Securities,"A new bill introduced in the House would clarify that a digital asset that is sold as part of an ""investment contract"" does not necessarily become a security. If passed, the Securities Clarity Act would help settle one of the most debated legal questions in the crypto space and make it more difficult for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to argue that many existing tokens are unregistered securities.  In 2018, Bill Hinman, then director of the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance, the agency’s unit that handles securities registration and disclosure, gave his now-infamous speech on how the securities laws apply to digital assets. He suggested that if the network on which a particular token functions was “sufficiently decentralized” to the point where “purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts,” then the “digital asset transaction may no longer represent a security offering.”  Tuongvy Le is a partner and head of regulatory at Bain Capital Crypto. Khurram Dara is a regulatory and policy principal at Bain Capital Crypto.  Since then, the question of “sufficient decentralization” and whether a digital asset could “transform” from a security to a non-security has been the subject of much debate. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly expressed skepticism over projects’ claims about decentralization and has pointedly refused to confirm that the reason he believes bitcoin is not a security is because it is “sufficiently decentralized.”  Meanwhile, in its still-ongoing litigation against Ripple Labs and two of its executives over the XRP token, the SEC has sought to distance itself from Hinman’s 2018 remarks, claiming that they were not official agency guidance.  Even so, a number of the SEC’s recent enforcement actions have considered whether a token project’s claims of decentralization would place it outside the definition of an “investment contract” – a type of security defined by a set of standards known as the Howey Test. In essence, the agency is implying it would be possible for a truly decentralized token to fall outside of its ambit, based on the “facts and circumstances” of each crypto project.  But on the question of whether a security can “transform” into something else, Gensler has previously stated that there is no precedent in the federal securities law for the concept.  If the recently introduced Securities Clarity Act becomes law, however, the answer to that question may no longer matter.  What would the Securities Clarity Act change?  The bipartisan bill, which Representatives Tom Emmer (R-MN) and Darren Soto (D-FL) announced in May, would clarify and codify that an asset sold or transferred pursuant to a fundraising transaction deemed an “investment contract” – and that is not otherwise a security – does not become a security just because it was sold or transferred as part of a securities offering. A version of the bill was first introduced in 2021.  The bill essentially distinguishes between an investment contract transaction, which is a securities offering, and the underlying investment contract asset, which is often not a security (like the orange groves in Howey). This means that a token offered as part of an investment contract would not need to “transform” into a non-security – it would not be a security in the first place.  The distinction is important because today, unlike the initial coin offerings (ICOs) of the past, many development teams that are interested in launching a token in the U.S. raise funds in SEC-compliant securities offerings using Regulation D (Reg D) offerings, an exemption from SEC registration typically associated with a public offering. In these private offerings, rather than sell to the public, issuers sell to “accredited investors” who acquire future token interests through purchase agreements (e.g. SAFEs or SAFTs) that call for token delivery upon certain conditions being met, such as network or protocol launch.  The key question for these projects is not whether a security can “transform” into a non-security, it is whether a token can be packaged in a multi-stage agreement involving a securities offering, without itself becoming a security.  This distinction between an investment contract transaction and an underlying asset had been “well-settled” according to the bill’s text, but has been “unnecessarily conflated in the context of digital assets.” Lewis Cohen of DLx Law argued the distinction is consistent with how federal courts have historically viewed “investment contracts.” In this sense, the bill does not break new ground as much as it provides certainty.  The bill is also good policy. Gensler frequently says existing token projects should “come in and register” their assets with the SEC. But conflating an investment contract transaction with the underlying token in order to shoehorn digital assets into the securities laws would not result in better investor protection. In fact, it might have the opposite effect.  See also: Come in and Register? These Firms Say They Found a Friendly Crypto Path  As our friends at Paradigm have thoroughly detailed, the current SEC disclosure framework is unfit for crypto assets, as it “fails to provide crypto-asset users and investors with the information they need, while also denying crypto entrepreneurs a viable path to compliance.”  By providing certainty over the distinction between an investment transaction and the underlying assets, the Securities Clarity Act provides a path to compliance in the U.S.  Moreover, given most crypto purchases take place in secondary market transactions that are independent of the issuer, by separating the investment contract from the underlying asset, the bill helps provide some comfort for trading platforms that currently struggle with evaluating whether a token that may have initially been offered in a securities transaction can subsequently be listed or made available for trading.  Finally, a world in which a digital asset can transform from a security to a non-security (and potentially back again?) presents real practical challenges in terms of supervision and enforcement.  Emmer’s bill does have an important qualification that the asset underlying the investment contract is “not otherwise a security.” Without this qualification, the bill would essentially create a loophole allowing issuers to evade securities laws. Unfortunately, this qualification also means that the SEC can still ultimately determine that an asset underlying an investment contract is a security – discretion that could be abused by a more aggressive regulator.  Facts and circumstances  Still, the bill would provide much-needed clarity and could not have come at a better time. For instance, a day before the bill was introduced, Grayscale revealed in a press release that the SEC had informed the firm of its view that filecoin (FIL) is a security, in connection with Grayscale filing a registration statement for a filecoin trust product.  But Protocol Labs, the team that developed the Filecoin protocol, raised funds from accredited investors in a compliant securities offering that was exempt from registration. Given that Protocol Labs did not sell tokens to the public to raise funds for the development of Filecoin, the SEC's argument that FIL is a security likely hinges on conflating the distinction between the investment contract and the underlying asset, which is used to help secure and purchase storage space on a decentralized file storage network.  Filecoin has been used to collect, verify and preserve everything from evidence of war crimes in Ukraine to important scientific information, representing one of the most compelling non-financial use cases in all of crypto.  Even though the proposed legislation would not preclude the SEC from determining that investment contract assets are otherwise securities, it would significantly reduce uncertainty for investors and issuers alike. At just five pages in length, it is a short but effective bill that would provide clarity with a simple amendment to the definition of a “security” in the federal securities laws.  While any potential legislation faces an uphill battle in the Senate, the bill is another step in the right direction from the House Financial Services Committee, which appears poised to pass a bill on payment stablecoins and is also rumored to be working on a market structure bill.",NEUTRAL,FIL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIL | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,"Tuongvy Le, Khurram Dara",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/05/31/a-house-bill-would-make-it-harder-for-the-sec-to-argue-crypto-tokens-are-securities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72b7a7b00243d9cc3ec6d5da0da447f60180acbb-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

These AI-powered tools make things like communication, collaboration, and getting stuff done a breeze, opening up all sorts of amazing opportunities we never had before. However, here's the thing: no industry can thrive without networking, and web3 is no different. So, if you want to stay ahead of the game, you’ve got to build a strong network and connect with other pros in the field. Stats show that networking is the secret sauce for 88% of successful professionals who've climbed the career ladder. And guess what? 61% of these pros believe that reaching out to their network creates awesome opportunities. Plus, networking conferences are like treasure troves for event planners, with 66% saying they're the best way to find new clients. A solid network of contacts in the web3 industry can make a huge difference. It opens doors to exciting possibilities and gives you access to capital, resources, and expertise that would otherwise be tough to find. You can team up with awesome people, bridge gaps between different parts of the industry, and make your professional dreams come true. Sure, LinkedIn and other networking platforms are helpful, but they lack that personal touch we all crave. They're not exactly built for the highly technical and specialized world of web3. And let's face it, not everyone has the guts to reach out to strangers or get warm introductions. Looking for the perfect fit isn't easy, and networking can be time-consuming and daunting. It doesn't end there! Web3 experts struggle to find trustworthy projects and individuals through exclusive communities and private events. They rely on word of mouth to find reliable contacts, but sometimes it doesn't work. That's why there should be a web3-specific network grounded in trust and professionalism, making it easier to connect with blockchain professionals. This is where web3-centric, AI-driven platforms like CryptoMatch come in handy. Using embedded OpenAI technology, CryptoMatch pairs C-level executives, developers, investors, and founders, while also taking on a warm introduction role.

Additionally, it builds community and connection within a fragmented web3 ecosystem. CryptoMatch links users to a network of more than 8,000 blockchain pros from 20 countries. It has arranged upwards of 12,000 successful meetings since its launch, and continues to be the go-to platform for web3 professionals worldwide. It has partnered with leading industry names, such as xDAO, Everscale, AIBC Conf, EpicWeb3, Guild DAO, Pontem Network, etc. There are a bunch of web3 products, communities, and DAOs signing up as well. To put it another way, CryptoMatch is a web3 crowd-puller where founders can collaborate, or top-level analysts, advisors or marketers can find rip-roaring projects to work on. From an investor's perspective, CryptoMatch helps VCs find the highest-quality startups to invest in. They can talk directly to founders about the ventures of interest and learn more about them.

The arrest came after the state government warned against using cryptocurrencies as payment options for any transaction. Bali Police Worked Undercover To Arrest Car Rental Business Owner While working undercover as customers, Bali police agents arrested an individual identified as TS (33) on May 29 in Jimbaran, Badung, in Bali, Indonesia. The Bali Police’s Cyber Unit started its investigations following increasing reports of people using crypto assets for transactions in the state. These include businesses like car rentals, cafes, hotels, property agencies, and others. Related Reading: Bullish Case For Litecoin Grows Stronger As LTC Halving Draws Close Chief of the Crime Investigation Unit Nanang Prihasmoko spoke to CNN Indonesia about the arrest. The unit chief stated that the police contacted the suspect as a potential renter by secretly infiltrating a car rental group on the Telegram app. The police then requested TS’s crypto wallet address for rental payment and set a physical meeting to conclude all arrangements. Finally, the police arrested the car rental owner at the point of the meeting. Prihasmoko revealed that TS had started accepting crypto payments from foreigners on the island three months ago. And following his arrest, the police seized some of the suspect’s assets, including his mobile phone used for crypto transactions. They also seized an Indodax account, a Pajero Sport vehicle, his ATM card, a Telegram account, and Telegram screenshots. According to Nanang, using any other currency for payments or financial obligations except the Indonesian rupiah violates Indonesian law. Offenders of such law could face one-year imprisonment and a penalty fine of IDR 200 million. Bali Warned Against Using Crypto For Payments The government of Bali has previously warned against the use of cryptocurrencies for payments in the region. In a statement by Bali Governor Wayan Koster, the ban on crypto payments cuts across different areas such as shopping, accommodations, restaurants, rentals, and other activities. Related Reading: Here Are The Top 3 Chinese Coins To Buy As China Leads The Bull Run The governor mentioned that anyone caught in the act would be strictly punished and the penalty could even include a forceful closure of the offenders’ businesses in the state. Furthermore, Governor Koster extended the warning against crypto use to tourists and other foreigners within the island state. He said the state has zero tolerance for violating laws and improper actions from tourists. According to the governor, foreigners violating Balian laws could face deportation, sanctions, or penalty fines. Indonesia only encourages the use of its local currency, the Indonesian rupiah. It is the only legal tender permitted for conducting transactions in the country.

42410529,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfLWB,1685548804,"EU Formally Signs New Crypto Licensing, Money Laundering Rules Into Law","The European Union formally signed its landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation into law on Wednesday, taking the bloc closer to becoming the first major jurisdiction in the world with tailored rules for the sector.  The law was signed by the European Parliament President Roberta Metsola and Swedish Rural Affairs Minister Peter Kullgren, alongside a separate anti-money laundering law that requires crypto providers to verify their customers' identity when they transfer funds.  The news was announced on Twitter by the Swedish government, which is chairing legislative talks as it holds the EU presidency. A parliament spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk that the laws in question include MiCA and the transfer of funds rules as well as two unrelated regulations on trade with Ukraine.  MiCA will enter into force in a few weeks after being published in the EU’s official journal, which is likely in June. Its provisions – offering crypto exchanges and wallet providers a license to operate across the 27-nation bloc, and requiring stablecoin issuers to hold appropriate reserves – will take effect between 12 and 18 months later.  MiCA was first proposed by the European Commission in 2020, and drew controversy when lawmakers came close to inserting environmentally minded provisions that could have amounted to a ban on the proof-of-work technology used by Bitcoin.  While the provisions were broadly welcomed by the industry, attention has also turned to the next stage of EU crypto regulation, with future laws potentially covering topics such as staking, non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance.

42410542,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfMDA,1685548800,"Sell Crypto Volatility in May, and Go Away?","As we approach the halfway mark for 2023, the year has been difficult to characterize for both equities and digital assets. Ongoing debates about the macroeconomic picture, both at home and internationally, have analysts wondering when the next shoe will drop. In March, when I wrote about the U.S. banking crisis, digital assets were rallying to annual highs, touted as a safe-haven asset and hedge against financial Armageddon.  Since then, almost any meaningful headline has been shrugged off as unimportant. In the face of bank instability, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, a 25-basis-point rate hike in May, a looming global recession and the U.S. debt-ceiling fight (that may or may not be resolved), digital assets (and equities) have seemingly lost interest in all conventional narratives that would normally spark a reaction from investors.  In trading terms, both realized and implied volatility have drifted into all-time-low territory. Bitcoin’s (BTC) range over the past two weeks has been reduced to 6.3% with 30-day realized volatility at 42.1 (4th percentile on a one-year lookback) and ether (ETH) stuck in a narrow 7.1% range, with 30-day realized vol at 41.9 (1st percentile over a one-year lookback).  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  To take advantage of the ever-decreasing volatility in digital assets, traders are pressing short vol bets, wagering that the current conditions will persist, and with major market makers like Jane Street and Jump Crypto reportedly slowing their crypto trading, maybe they are right.  But can it really be that simple? “Sell volatility in May and go away?” Or are investors ignoring meaningful signals that could push bitcoin and ether out of their recent boundaries?  The June 1 debt-ceiling deadline emerged recently as the obvious candidate for a binary volatility event. And for good reason: A default would send shockwaves through markets worldwide.  In response to the uncertainty around this, bond markets have been pricing in risks, with 2- and 30-year Treasury yields rising sharply in May. And the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has initiated a strong double bottom rally off the 101.0 level. Typically, holding above this level hasn’t been good for bitcoin. A simple look at the chart below gives some perspective on the inverse correlation between bitcoin and DXY.  Suffice to say, the recent calm in bitcoin and ether volatility should not lull market participants into a false sense of security. As the winds of macroeconomic change continue to blow, and underappreciated narratives start to play out, we could witness the sharp return of volatility that these assets are known for. If the “higher for longer” narrative continues to play out, expect a sticky dollar index above 101, and ongoing pressure for digital assets as investors navigate these murky waters.

42410540,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfM9r,1685548800,Washington Ignored Crypto for Now. That’s Good for Bitcoin.,"So, there was a deal resolving the U.S. debt ceiling battle in Washington, D.C. Now what? First, let’s look at where we are.  The words “crypto” and “cryptocurrencies” don’t appear at all in the initial version of the deal. I wrestle with whether that’s good or bad. The Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax wasn’t included, so I’ve landed on the former since the omission is positive for the industry.  The proposal would’ve levied a 30% tax on any firm using computing resources to mine digital assets. The premise was driven by concerns about the consumption of fossil fuels in mining, and subsequent environmental harm.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Ironically, the debt ceiling agreement may be viewed as a win for fossil-fuel advocates. It includes a provision for the expedited completion of a natural-gas pipeline between West Virginia and Virginia (the Mountain Valley Pipeline). That is expected to transmit natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale gas fields to markets in the Mid- and South Atlantic regions of the U.S.  At first glance, this provision may actually be a positive for bitcoin (BTC) miners. Since some of them use excess natural gas as an energy source, several have previously set up operations near the Marcellus and Utica Shales to accomplish this.  Increased infrastructure for natural gas may lead to increased production, and thus increased excess gas, resulting in increased sources of energy for miners in the region. I would label this as an indirect benefit, and definitely one that was unintentional.  Indirect benefits notwithstanding, bitcoin reacted favorably to the agreement, with prices increasing 4% on Sunday. The move higher seems related more to increased certainty, and at least a sigh of relief that nothing antagonistic towards crypto was included.  The price increase ranked 10th in daily moves for 2023.  Where do we go from here? A quick look at the schedules for both the House and the Senate indicate nothing currently planned as it relates to hearings.  Total public debt will undoubtedly rise, as will the amount of interest payments being made by the U.S.  The spread between 2- and 10-year Treasury yields remains negative, as short-term debt rates remain higher than longer-term debt. The problematic nature of the inverted yield curve can’t be ignored. It's the equivalent of telling someone that you have more faith that someone will be able to pay you back in 10 years than in two – not exactly a ringing endorsement of present economic strength.  An increased issuance of bonds could occur, as the U.S. looks to rebuild its balances within the Treasury General Account – the result of which could be a withdrawal of liquidity from financial markets, and a potential headwind for bitcoin prices.  Another interpretation could be that the latest chapter of borrowing and spending will be viewed as exactly the reason why cryptocurrencies hold value. Particularly those with hard monetary supply caps like bitcoin. Advocates for ether (ETH) will likely trumpet its deflationary nature.  What will be interesting to see is the extent to which cryptocurrencies become a political football in 2023 and moving forward. Both sides of the aisle include individuals both for and against digital assets. Admittedly, it's taken a decidedly more partisan turn over the last year, which I view as problematic.  The exclusion of a crypto mining tax allows the current administration the latitude to state that they took no negative action versus bitcoin, avoiding an issue that still appears to be very much up for grabs.  It will be important over time to keep an eye on who says what about crypto assets in the political realm. But as it relates to this most recent debt deal, not much was said at all.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here’s some news worth reading:  BITCOIN POLITICS: It sure looks like crypto, bitcoin and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are going to be hot topics on the campaign trail leading up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election. “The current regime, clearly, has it out for Bitcoin,” Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor and Republican candidate for president, said last week. “And if it continues for another four years, they’ll probably end up killing it.” One can’t help wondering if this is bait for libertarian-minded crypto advocates who might view Republicans’ attacks on civil liberties (anti-abortion and anti-trans legislation, book bans, etc) distasteful. And here’s CoinDesk’s Daniel Kuhn on the growing culture war around bitcoin.  SEC FRIENDLY: Much of the talk around crypto lately has involved big industry players arguing U.S. regulators have been opaque and frustrating to work with. And, yet, this CoinDesk piece explains how a couple companies, Prometheum Ember Capital and OTC Markets Group, have just figured out how to use existing rules (not ones especially tailored to crypto) to get themselves approved to operate in the crypto space. Food for thought!  BUY AND HODL: The long-term trend with U.S. stocks has been clear: people are holding equities for less and less time. Warren Buffett’s approach is not ascendant in stocks. However, over in bitcoin – an asset class the Oracle of Omaha hates – his long-term approach is how things work! Investors are hanging onto BTC longer than ever. It’s doubtful this’ll persuade Buffett to dive in, though.  WORLDCOIN’S DEAL: Worldcoin, the project that was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, just raised an eye-catching $115 million in venture funding. Worldcoin is the creator of World ID, a privacy-focused decentralized identification project. There is an artificial intelligence angle, which probably explains the big dollars. “As we embark on the age of AI, it is imperative that individuals are able to maintain personal privacy while proving their humanness. In doing so we can help ensure that everyone can realize the financial benefits that AI is poised to deliver,” said Alex Blania, CEO and co-founder of Tools for Humanity, the team behind Worldcoin.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | WLD,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/31/washington-ignored-crypto-for-now-thats-good-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/321efe35c4b636754a6e094c7adc420f2ab6208c-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Tuesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that Ishan Wahi, a former Coinbase Global product manager, and his brother, Nikhil Wahi, agreed to settle charges that they engaged in insider trading relating to at least nine crypto asset securities. Wahi Brothers Agree to Settle Civil Charges The securities watchdog said the Wahi brothers agreed to settle civil charges that they engaged in a scheme to trade ahead of multiple announcements relating to at least nine crypto asset securities, which would be made available on Coinbase’s platform. Ishan Wahi was arrested in 2022 and charged with insider trading after it emerged that he was feeding his brother Nikhil, and another individual, with information about crypto assets to be listed on Coinbase. Authorities investigating the matter said Wahi’s brother and a fellow conspirator, Sameer Ramani, made over $1 million between June 2021 and April 2022 with the information provided by Ishan Wahi. Ishan Wahi was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Nikhil Wahi was sentenced to 10 months in prison in January and was ordered to pay a fine of $892,500 after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. SEC Argues Digital Assets Should Fall Under Its Oversight The SEC has grown increasingly active in policy in the crypto industry, filing numerous lawsuits against several major crypto-related firms since the start of 2023. Reuters reports that in the lawsuits, the agency has argued that many digital assets are securities and fall under its oversight, including the case against the Wahi brothers. During pleading to the criminal charges, Ishan Wahi stated that he did not believe any of the tokens in question were securities. Coinbase is not a party to the SEC allegations against the Wahi brothers, but the firm filed an amicus brief supporting the Wahi brother’s motion to dismiss the SEC’s case.

Tether (USDT) has already added a whopping $1.5 billion of BTC to its reserves, and traders view this sustained buy pressure positively. With Tether (USDT) supporting Bitcoin (BTC), it allows the rest of the market to move upwards, and analysts have put the spotlight on Tradecruve (TCRV), a new AI-specialized trading platform they believe will surge 5,000% in the coming weeks. Tradecurve (TCRV) Democtaziing Access to Financial MarketsTradecurve reimagines the trading experience and powers a futuristic experience, all while users maintain anonymity. No KYC is required to use the platform, and investors can begin trading with just an email account. The protocol blends the best of decentralized trading platforms (self-custody & anonymity) with the best features of centralized trading platforms (institutional-level liquidity) to deliver the ultimate trading experience. Tradecurve goes beyond a regular derivatives service provider with an integrated Metaverse trading academy, social trading features such as copy trading, and its artificial intelligence trading algorithms. These features are unlockable through token ownership, causing analysts to forecast massive buy pressure for $TCRV. They further stated it could quickly 50X in the coming weeks before the presale closes.The platform will introduce Proof of Reserves to ensure legitimacy. And detailed in the whitepaper is a thorough plan for registering 100,000 traders within three months of operation. With 500:1 leverage, low latency trades, and access to multiple markets, including forex, commodities, stocks, and cryptos from a single interface, Tradecurve has democratized access to financial markets for millions of retail investors globally and will grow in line with this outstanding value proposition. A pioneering derivatives service provider and an investment opportunity investors would be foolish to miss. Tether (USDT) Adds Bitcoin to its ReservesTether (USDT) initially launched in 2014 and is the crypto market’s largest stablecoin ranked via market cap. Tether (USDT) was a beneficiary of the USDC depeg event as traders, users, and even whales rotated from USDC to Tether (USDT). Tether (USDT) has been doing excellent business as the FED has raised interest rates. Tether (USDT) holds billions and billions of dollars in short-dated treasury bills to back the value of Tether (USDT), which can be sold when investors want to exchange Tether (USDT) at a 1:1 ratio for dollars.As short-dated yields hit decade highs, Tether (USDT) has been clipping coupons and pocketing interest payments from the United States. Tether (USDT) has now decided to use some of this funding to buy Bitcoin (BTC), and this steady buy pressure should help markets rise.

42410544,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfMGT,1685547000,"5 Years After the $500K Ethereum Wager Between Joe Lubin and Jimmy Song, Who Won?","The bet placed five years ago on the future of crypto feels like an echo from a completely different era.  Announced at CoinDesk's Consensus conference in 2018 with a May 2023 end date, the wager emerged before the DeFi Summer of 2020, when development of decentralized financial products built on top of Ethereum exploded. Before the gigantic bull market that crumbled last year. Before 2022's disasters including FTX, Terra and Celsius.  Yet, it's not an irrelevant historical curiosity. The terms between bitcoin maximalist Jimmy Song and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin – major figures on what are arguably polar opposite sides of crypto – and who won tell a lot about the current state of the industry and the prospects for mainstream adoption as it recovers from the wreckage of the past year.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  After Song said onstage at that 2018 conference that there wouldn't be any significant decentralized applications in five years, Lubin offered to bet “any amount” that he was wrong. They later got more specific about the terms of a wager: For Lubin to win, five or more applications built atop Ethereum needed to hold onto 10,000 daily and 100,000 monthly active users for at least six months in any 12-month period before May 23, 2023. A daily active user was defined as an on-chain transaction initiated by a single Ethereum address.  In other words: A handful of Ethereum apps needed to get, as Song put it, the sort of traction enjoyed by a minimally successful Android or iPhone app.  The bet was sealed with a handshake.  Who won? “Given we never specified the terms, I have no idea,” Song wrote when contacted by CoinDesk last week. Lubin didn’t say who he thinks won when contacted recently by CoinDesk.  Though Song and Lubin may be fuzzy on the original agreement, CoinDesk took a crack at sorting out who would’ve won based on the publicly disclosed terms.  Two blockchain data firms (Artemis and Nansen) say five decentralized apps (dapps) met the specified usage levels over the past half-decade – the bare minimum for a Lubin win. But there might be some wiggle room over whether the five names in the datasets qualify as dapps.  So, if Lubin was the victor, he just squeaked by; it wasn't a blowout. And he might’ve lost, depending on whom you ask.  Given all the hype around dapp development during the last bull market run that took Ethereum total value locked (TVL) – a measure of how much money is sloshing around a protocol’s ecosystem – above $100 billion back in November 2021, that’s counterintuitive, and telling. (There are over 14,000 Ethereum dapps today, according to DappRadar. They’re just mostly small.)  “I think the results show how early the industry is,” Laura Shin, who hosted the duo on her Unconfirmed podcast in 2018 shortly after the bet, told CoinDesk.  The crypto bet  Back when this all started five years ago, the main innovation of Ethereum – a blockchain that served as a platform for smart contracts that automatically do things in a decentralized way, or programmable money, as it were – was still nascent. Song wasn’t convinced it’d go anywhere.  “Even if by some miracle you have some popular dapp, you're going to be able to build it much cheaper, faster, more scalable and more maintainable and upgradable on a centralized platform and crush that dapp,” Song told former CoinDesk reporter Brady Dale at Consensus 2019.  Lubin said at the time: “Jimmy's thesis was that there would be no significant applications on blockchain, and the only thing relevant in blockchain was Bitcoin. … My thesis is, Bitcoin is awesome, and there's a narrow set of use cases built on Bitcoin and that's wonderful. We love that, but decentralized applications are also really useful.”  If the conditions were met, Song would pay 810.8 ETH to Lubin. If not, Lubin would pay Song 69.74 BTC. Each bet was worth $500,000 at the time. (By today’s numbers, Lubin would win $1.5 million and Song would win $1.9 million.)  The results  According to blockchain data firms Artemis and Nansen, the five applications that broke both the 10,000 daily active and 100,000 monthly active user marks in the agreed-on time period were Circle, OpenSea, Tether, Uniswap and wrapped ETH (WETH).  While MakerDAO, 0x, Gnosis Safe, Chainlink, MetaMask and 1inch also had more than 100,000 monthly active users in the agreed-on time period, they did not meet the 10,000 daily active users criteria.  But before declaring this a Lubin victory, consider the disagreement in the crypto community about what constitutes a dapp.  “I don't count WETH as an application,” Station Labs co-founder Mind Apivessa told CoinDesk over Telegram. “WETH is an ERC-20 token standard. It’s used because it makes it easier to trade on dApps with ETH.”  Lindsey Winder, CEO of Hedgey Finance, said, “Smart contracts are not by default dapps. … Dapps in my mind are the interface that allow people to interact with smart contracts in a no-code way. If I’m using a service like Uniswap to wrap and unwrap ETH, then I'm using a dapp. If I’m wrapping and unwrapping ETH directly with the smart contract, then I’m not using a dapp.”  Circle and Tether don’t count as dapps, Nansen data journalist Martin Lee said, mainly because “most users can’t interact with it freely.”  Shin of Unconfirmed said: “Looks like Jimmy won since I don’t think anyone would call Circle, OpenSea or Tether a dapp.” She added that she thinks there eventually could be enough dapps that meet the thresholds from the bet.  Artemis Chief Operating Officer Jimmy Zheng does think all five qualify as dapps, saying via Telegram: “Fundamentally, the definition of an application is a construct given that the actual atomic unit within these blockchain platforms is the smart contract, which other contracts/addresses interact with. So from that perspective, they are dapps in the sense that there are a multitude of other addresses/contracts interacting with applications such as WETH, OpenSea, Circle and Tether.”  Apivessa conceded that while she wouldn’t consider wrapped ETH an application, “I can see one can philosophically categorize WETH as an application since it makes ETH compatible with certain apps that it wouldn’t otherwise be compatible with.”  Epilogue  Jimmy Song’s overarching thesis for the wager depended on whether significant applications could exist on the Ethereum network, and it is clear there are several.  A glance at data from Artemis and Nansen on daily and monthly active users shows a number of applications on the Ethereum blockchain with heavy usage, even if they don’t meet all the bet’s criteria.  In 2019, Lubin said that even if five dapps didn’t have the number of active users from the bet, the ecosystem might be just fine.  “It's possible that I will lose and Ethereum will come out very strong,” he said.  Regardless of who won this round, Song or Lubin, the long-term rivalry between the two largest blockchains is far from settled.  Additional reporting by Melissa Montanez.

By joining HKVAC, an organization dedicated to providing credit ratings for crypto asset exchanges and trading products. Huobi aims to develop a venture capital database that caters to the needs of the market, actively engage in educating the public about crypto investments, and offer Hong Kong traders a ""one-stop"" crypto asset trading service. Ultimately, with Huobi Hong Kong (Huobi HK) as the pivot, Huobi is committed to supporting Hong Kong in its efforts to become a global Web3 hub. HKVAC is said to be a collaboration of many crypto industry players, including exchanges, institutional investors, and Hong Kong-licensed rating agencies. It was established primarily to enhance the industry's capabilities in security risk management and to assist the Central Government and Hong Kong's local authorities in building a world-leading hub for virtual asset and digital finance. At the same time, it commits itself to creating a safe, open and transparent environment for crypto asset investments under the guidance of ""Hong Kong's new crypto regulations.” It will also promote the acceptance and recognition of crypto assets by helping the public gain systematic, correct and secure knowledge about crypto investments. As an exchange that always prioritizes ""global security and compliance operations"", Huobi has maintained the best industry record of 100% functionality and no security incidents for ten years since its inception. Huobi will bring its expertise in security technology and its compliant, standardized processes to HKVAC as a reference. Together they can provide risk management indicators to investors in the industry and set strict rating standards to evaluate existing exchanges, so that more crypto investors can have a clear understanding of the risk level of their investments. This will accelerate the creation of a safe and friendly crypto environment in Hong Kong. In addition, as a pioneer in establishing itself as a Web3 gateway, Huobi will join hands with HKVAC to continuously pursue multi-dimensional collaborations and advancements in technology, data, and ecosystem development. Together, Huobi and HKVAC will facilitate the application of Web3 infrastructure and build a bridge between the real world and the realm of Web3 to encourage wider acceptance and participation in Web3. These endeavors will drive the development of Hong Kong's Web 3.0 industry and serve as the stepping stones on Hong Kong's way to becoming a global hub for Web 3.0 (the third-generation Internet). As previously reported, Huobi will officially launch Huobi HK. Starting June 1, Huobi HK is expected to deliver unparalleled trading experiences to Web3 users through its wide range of products. Users can trade cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, TRX, LTC, BCH, DOGE, SHIB, BTT, SOL, ADA, and other major cryptocurrencies listed in the independent index on Huobi HK. A Huobi representative said that joining HKVAC will boost Huobi's business in Hong Kong and lay the foundation for future operations that comply with laws and regulations. Meanwhile, Huobi intends to work with various parties in the industry to build the ecosystem of Web3 under the premise of policy compliance. It will start by establishing itself as a Web3 gateway to promote the development of Web3 in Hong Kong. Hopefully, Huobi will be granted a cryptocurrency trading license in Hong Kong in the near future, so that it can collaborate with the Hong Kong government, regulators, and other institutions to create a better crypto market in the region. About Huobi Founded in 2013, Huobi has evolved from a crypto exchange into a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain businesses that span digital asset trading, financial derivatives, wallets, research, investment, incubation and other areas.

SBI Governor Addresses The Potential Risks During his speech, Deputy Governor Mahesh Kumar Jain evaluated the risks involved in sustainable growth. He further discussed the importance of effective corporate governance, governance structure, and how to prepare for potential risk. According to Jain, banks face a series of challenges arising from technological disruption, customer expectations, and cyber threats in today’s ever-changing environment.

SItharaman believes the central bank must drive crypto; otherwise, it can fall like those without proper government backing, causing huge spillover effects like FTX. She highlights the limitations of individual countries’ actions in regulating crypto assets, stating that the interconnectedness of the global order renders such measures ineffective.

13059886,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535826,1685544219,U.S.A. TikTok Ban: What is the Potential Impact on Crypto and Finance Influencers?,"TikTok has been in the news recently as the U.S. wants to ban the app over fears of the Chinese government using it for surveillance, with Montana being the first state to officially ban the app. With 150 million Americans using TikTok, a blanket ban of the app could have a large impact on people’s livelihoods, especially those who rely TikTok for income. At NewsBTC we wanted to analyze some of the biggest crypto and financial influencers on the platform to find out what they could potentially lose if TikTok is banned in the U.S.A. TikTok Financial Influencers Potential Monthly Loss From our seed list the financial influencer who could have the biggest loss in earnings is Tori Dunlap or @herfirst100k on TikTok. Dunlap has 2.2 million followers on TikTok and we estimate she could lose over $600k a month if TikTok is banned. Another influencer who could see a massive loss in earnings is Vivian Tu or @yourrichbff on TikTok. With 2.4 million followers Tu is estimated to have a potential earning loss of almost $160k a month. Mark Tilbury – @marktilbury – is also set to lose a massive $108k a month if TikTok is banned. TikTok Crypto Influencers Potential Monthly Loss From our list of crypto influencers the influencer who could have the biggest loss in earnings is Mason Verslius @cryptomasun on TikTok. According to our research he could lose over $61k a month if a ban is put in place. The crypto influencer who could face the second largest loss in earnings is @cryptowendyo, who could lose just under $60k a month. Lucas Dimos – @theblockchainboy – is third on our list with a potential monthly loss of over $31k. TikTok Financial Influencers Total Earnings Estimated earnings are based on the number of videos an influencer posts and their engagement rate. Therefore, for some of the larger influencers analyzed, the TikTok ban is estimated to have less impact. For example, Erika Kaulberg – @erikakullberg – has 9.2 million followers but is 6th on our list for total earnings at $1.09 million and estimated to lose $45k a month. TikTok Crypto Influencer Total Earnings From our list of crypto influencers @cryptoprojects has the biggest following of 1.4 million with estimated total earnings of $106k putting him at 7th on our list of top earners. Just above @cryptoprojects is @nft.degen, the second largest crypto influencer on our list with 1.3 million followers. His estimated total earnings are just $124k, making his estimated monthly earning loss $5.6k. Methodology NewsBTC analyzed the biggest Finance and Crypto influencers on TikTok to find out what their potential monthly loss of earnings could be if TikTok is banned in the U.S.A. A list of the top 50 influencers was collated by merging a list of ‘best crypto currency influencers’ from the top Google results. NewsBTC did this by calculating what the estimated total earnings are for top crypto and financial influencers, and dividing that by the number of months they had been active on the platform. Total earnings were calculated using the TikTok Money Calculator on Influencer Marketing Hub which takes the number of videos and engagement rate into account when providing earning estimations.",NEUTRAL,없음,RESEARCH,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/research/usa-tiktok-ban-impact-on-crypto-and-finance-influencers/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

""This is not a case of rightsizing, but rather, reevaluating whether we have the right talent and expertise in critical roles, and therefore we will still be seeking to fill hundreds of open roles,"" a spokesperson told CoinDesk on Wednesday.  A report earlier Wednesday by independent journalist Colin Wu claimed that Binance may have laid off as much as 20% of its staff. The firm currently has 8,000 employees, the Binance spokesperson said.  Binance Chief Communications Officer Patrick Hillman later confirmed via tweet the ""need to streamline,"" though he denied the company is cutting 20% of staff.  ""We have regularly gone through a talent density audit and resource allocation exercise every six months or so,"" said Hillman. ""There is no specific number, just direction on where we need to streamline.""

42420340,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUlMmz,1685542738,"EU’s Banking Regulator Highlights AML Risks in Privacy Coins, Self-Hosted Wallets","Crypto companies should watch out for customers using privacy coins or self-hosted wallets as they try to spot potential money laundering activity, the European Banking Authority said in draft guidance published Wednesday.  The plans, open for comment until August 31, follow a series of crackdowns on crypto tools which can enhance online privacy, but which lawmakers worry can be used to hide criminal or terrorist money.  Providers of crypto asset services such as exchanges and wallets, known as CASPs, can see heightened money laundering risks due to the innovative technology that enables instant transfers across the world, the EBA said in a statement.  “The EBA is proposing to amend its [money laundering and terrorist financing] risk factors guidelines to set common, regulatory expectations of the steps CASPs should take to identify and mitigate these risks effectively,” and to help them vet potential and existing customers, the EBA said.  Using mixers and tumblers, zero-knowledge proofs and privacy coins indicates higher risk, the guidance said. So do customers with multiple accounts who make transactions to self-hosted wallets that aren’t operated by a regulated CASP, or are located in supposedly under-regulated overseas jurisdictions.  Banks looking to take on crypto clients will also need to check their regulatory license and ownership, the guidance said.  In recent months and years, the European Union has sought to tackle money laundering risks from secretive crypto transactions. New money laundering rules could curb trades with self-hosted wallets where the owner can’t be identified, and may even ban anonymous coins such as zcash, monero and dash outright. In a March proposal, the EBA also highlighted extra risks for businesses that use crypto-style distributed ledger technology.  Meanwhile, U.S. authorities have sanctioned Tornado Cash, a privacy tool on the Ethereum blockchain that they say has been used to discreetly raise funds for North Korean regime. Some lawmakers and former regulators have suggested U.S. regulators’ actions amount to a deliberate attempt to isolate crypto from the traditional banking system, mirroring a previous “Choke Point” crackdown on gun businesses.

With Germany leading the European Union’s economy, many expect that Germany could pressure the European Central Bank to cut rates to stimulate the economy. Low-interest rates act as rocket fuel for altcoins, and analysts predict it would cause Shiba Inu (SHIB) to rally and add more fuel to Tradecurve (TCRV), a hybrid exchange that has already posted impressive growth in the past weeks. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW Tradecurve (TCRV) On-Track to Raise $20 Million in PresaleTradecurve (TCRV) remains on track to raise a staggering $20 million in its presale as demand spikes. It seems the market has begun to process the value proposition of this exciting new platform that has already announced its plans to onboard 100,000 traders within three months of launch. Tradecurve will provide high leverage, anonymity, and unfettered access to global markets, including forex, stocks, crypto, and commodities. This nascent challenger in the trading industry features transparent on-chain pricing, intuitional level liquidity powering excellent fills for traders, and, most excitingly, has integrated artificial intelligence trading algorithms accessible only to $TCRV holders. Tradecurve is a derivatives platform where users stay anonymous. It provides a haven for millions of retail clients worldwide who cannot access leveraged trading products due to shortsighted government regulations. Analysts predict explosive growth for $TCRV expecting a 5,000% leap before the presale closes. They cited the protocol’s AI speciality and its plans to introduce Proof of Reserves to validate these claims. Some analysts even compared it to the famous Binance Coin (BNB) ICO in 2017 that began at a price of $0.15. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price PredictionShiba Inu (SHIB) benefitted from the memecoin mania that descended on Crypto Twitter recently. Still, the real hype has come from the impressive metrics posted by Shibarium, a layer two scaling solution built by the developers of Shiba Inu (SHIB). Shibaroium has executed more than twelve million transactions, and it will allow Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders to swap between the native ecosystem tokens $BONE and $LEASH with lower fees. Additionally, the chain will utilize $BONE for gas fees, and rumor is gas fees will be swapped for Shiba Inu (SHIB) and burnt. Analysts have forecast a range between $0.00001473 and $0.00001762 for Shiba Inu (SHIB), which appears slightly conservative given the amount of development currently taking place on the network. The release of Shibarium perfectly encapsulates the Shiba Inu (SHIB) philosophy of being a memecoin but also delivering utility.

Some new altcoins have properties that make them stand out amongst established cryptocurrencies. Consequently, those with unique profit-making capabilities enjoy more success in the crypto market. For new cryptocurrencies hoping to gain investors' trust, it is important to be backed up by properties that contribute to the token's value. One of the ways of doing this is by creating systems that can keep up with the technological evolution of the 21st century. InQubeta (QUBE) is here to usher AI technology into the crypto market this season. By ensuring that crypto investors can now invest in AI start-ups, InQubeta is one of the unique altcoins that has created a new playing field for itself, and analysts suspect that it may soar higher than crypto giants like Ethereum (ETH). InQubeta (QUBE) Merges AI Investment with the Crypto Market InQubeta is certainly on the right path to becoming one of the biggest cryptocurrencies. With an impressive presale, InQubeta is already making the right moves to ensure that it remains relevant long after it has been launched. The presale is in its early stages and has already raised over $200,000, with more than 50% of the Beta Stage tokens sold. The increased demand for QUBE tokens will only increase its value. The InQubeta platform will make significant contributions to the growth of AI technology. The way it works is that AI start-ups needing investors can create trending NFTs with inherent utilities and list them on the InQubeta platform, allowing investors to choose what kinds they want. By leveraging the properties and popularity of trending NFTs, InQubeta has positioned itself as a crypto project worth long-term investment purposes. The QUBE token also offers an avenue for governance on the platform. This means that QUBE holders can use their ERC20 tokens to participate in important decisions on the platform. InQubeta ensures that investors can keep in touch with innovations in the AI market. Its ERC20 tokens are an added advantage as the Ethereum blockchain successfully allows the platform to host its NFT marketplace. What makes it all the more impressive is that InQubeta is projected to grow more than Ethereum in 2023. Visit InQubeta Presale Ethereum (ETH) Opens the Door to a New Generation of Crypto Tokens Ethereum (ETH) was one of the cryptocurrencies created to serve as an alternative to Bitcoin. It is now one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world. A large portion of Ethereum's popularity is because it allows other cryptocurrencies to grow. Several projects rely on the Ethereum blockchain, and numerous tokens rely on the Ethereum standard, making it a valuable addition to the crypto market. Many of these tokens are in the top 100 list on the DeFi market. ETH was the first project to introduce the idea of smart contracts, making it possible for different parties to carry out transactions with each other. Overall, Ethereum has reduced transaction costs and increased the number of operations on its blockchain. By introducing periodic updates, Ethereum can stay ahead of the demands of the crypto market. It also allows for a cryptocurrency, such as InQubeta, to potentially experience bigger growth. Conclusion What better way to make money from the DeFi market than to invest in new crypto projects like InQubeta? This AI cryptocurrency is already on the way to making a name for itself worldwide. Every indication indicates that InQubeta could grow bigger than Ethereum in 2023. Buying QUBE tokens from the InQubeta presale presents an opportunity to make more profit. The token's value increases further as time passes, ensuring that early investors can make more money. Be a part of InQubeta now to benefit from the evolution of the AI market.

This report delineates a milestone in financial technology, showcasing an altogether new financial instrument that consistently outperforms existing options desks in generating both competitive premia and sustainable yields, backtested against genuine, multi-year historical cryptocurrency market data and options prices. The report is the culmination of a two-year exercise in Research and Development powered by a $20m investment and derived in collaboration with CADLabs and the Swiss Centre for Cryptoeconomics. Key highlights from the simulation report: On average, Bumper Takers paid 9.3% cheaper premia than buyers of traditional put options. During the 2022 bear market, Bumper’s simulation showed a yield improvement of 46.2% for Makers compared to options pricing, without resorting to token incentives. The protocol remained solvent throughout the simulated conditions. Despite having different inputs and methodology, Bumper’s results reveal a remarkable correlation with the Nobel Prize-winning Black-Scholes model. These results have been pivotal in understanding and honing the resilience of the Bumper protocol across diverse market conditions. On the release of the report, Bumper CEO Jonathan DeCarteret expressed, ""By challenging and potentially reshaping the accepted norms of options pricing, Bumper stands to revolutionise not just the crypto options market, but also has the potential to penetrate traditional finance and disrupt the colossal $13T derivatives market in the future."" The report underscores the anticipated outcomes of Bumper's dynamic pricing, based on forward volatility rather than the usual implied volatility. The findings of the simulation report positions Bumper as an immensely appealing prospect for institutions and fund managers, in addition to retail crypto investors. The economic simulation report released today marks the most significant validation of Bumper's innovative approach to date, and signals what could be one of the most substantial challenges to the Black-Scholes derived pricing in half a century.

The second sale of 3AC collectibles from the ""Grails"" collection will be held in New York on June 15 and will feature 37 works from generative artists like Dmitri Cherniak, Tyler Hobbs, Jeff Davis and more.  In a press release, the auction house said that the sale will mark the largest-ever live auction of digital art.  ""For the live auction, we specifically wanted to focus on showcasing generative art, and the sale was curated to reflect not only the collection’s deep holdings of some of the most sought-after and renowned generative artists in the movement, but also to spotlight the wider community of artists pushing the boundaries of the algorithm-based art,"" Micahel Bouhanna, Sotheby's head of digital art and NFTs, told CoinDesk.  Highlights from this batch of NFTs include Cherniak’s Ringers #879, a seminal generative artwork that has become known as ""The Goose"" for its resemblance to the bird. The collectible was purchased by 3AC co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies in August 2021 for about 1,800 ETH – worth roughly $5.8 million at the time.  Bouhanna called this piece a major highlight of Cherniak's portfolio and ""one of the most significant works from the generative art movement.""  ""What makes it so special is the unique variation caused by the randomness of its generation, creating the goose-like image at the center, and perfectly encapsulating the realm of possibilities inherent in algorithmic art,"" he explained.

The upcoming auction follows a successful first NFT sale earlier this month, which brought in over $2.4 million, including another Hobbs' Fidenza NFT that sold for over $1 million, far exceeding its estimated sale price.

Announced Wednesday, the fundraising event was led by one of the top Web 3 VC firms CMCC Global. The latest capital round aims to further Anoma’s goal to bring the third generation of blockchains to market and decentralize the financial system, giving power back to the users. The fundraising also welcomed pledges from other prominent industry players including Electric Capital, Delphi Digital, Dialectic, KR1, Spartan, NGC, MH Ventures, Bixin Ventures, No Limit, Plassa, Perridon Ventures, Anagram, and Factor. Additionally, over 30 angel investors across the blockchain space also participated in the round, embracing Anoma Foundation’s vision. The Swiss non-profit firm is focused on funding the development of its blockchain architecture to bring fully decentralized systems to Web 2.5 apps including rollups, DEXs and other DApps. With significant backing from investors across the blockchain industry, Anoma will further the development of intent-centric blockchain architecture, bringing to life a “new paradigm for building blockchain infrastructure layers”, the press statement reads. “Compared to existing architectures such as Ethereum/EVM, it makes dApps an order of magnitude more composable and an order of magnitude easier to build,” said Adrian Brink, Co-founder of Anoma. Anoma’s intent-centric blockchain architecture allows these “partially decentralized apps” to give power back to their users while promoting the development of novel apps that previously could not be built on existing architectures. “The team is pushing the boundaries of protocol design and reimagining how base layer infrastructure should operate,” said Charlie Morris, Co-founder and Managing Partner of CMCC Global. “It is refreshing to see Anoma’s designs and philosophy against the backdrop of a homogenous group of layer-1 smart contract platforms.” Apart from offering a platform to build fully decentralized apps, Anoma’s latest capital raise will also enhance the platform’s scalability, user experience, privacy and interoperability, Tommy Shaughnessy, Founding Partner of Delphi Digital shared in his statement. “Anoma's intent-centric architecture represents a significant advancement across all fronts of blockchain infrastructure[...],” Shaughnessy added. “We are excited to be part of their journey towards revolutionizing decentralized applications.” Notwithstanding, the funding will also be used to support ongoing research and development initiatives, and boost adoption rates via easy-to-integrate development tools that enable the development of novel DApps. In addition, the cash will be used to form strategic partnerships and enhance the overall ecosystem development. “We are super excited to be investing in Anoma,” added Dialectic founder Ryan Zurrer. “Their intent-centricity and inherent focus on low-level privacy promises to unlock novel use-cases, particularly in areas such as next-generation DeFi, and represents a major step forward for the space.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The reason for this was a massive amount of OP tokens that were unlocked this week, leading to significant buy pressure on the digital asset. However, the bearish trend does not seem to have ended yet given that the altcoin could see more buying pressure. $600 Million Token Unlock Sends Optimism Spiralling On Tuesday, Optimism saw one of its largest token unlocks when over 300 million were released into circulation. These tokens accounted for around 9% of the total OP supply, which was a significant amount to move into the market, especially during a bear market. Related Reading: Bullish Case For Litecoin Grows Stronger As LTC Halving Draws Close The coins totaling 386 million OP at the time were worth approximately $600 million. This meant that there was now $600 million worth of new potential selling pressure for the token and the altcoin began to respond before the unlock was live. In the hours leading up to the massive unlock, OP’s price first dropped around 7%. But then the unlock triggered further sell pressure and by the time the sellers were done for the day, the digital asset had already lost more than 20% of the value it began the day with. OP falls to five-month low | Source: OPUSD on TradingView.com More Pain To Come For OP Holders? While it does seem that OP sellers are starting to tire out, the bearish case for the altcoin continues. This is because the $600 million unlock was only the first unlock for core contributors and investors, meaning VCs and others. Data from Token Unlocks shows that Optimism has another token unlock coming up at the end of June for a total of 24.15 million tokens. This means that a month from now, another $34.5 million worth of tokens will be unlocked. This 0.562% of supply may be smaller than the 9% unlock that took place in May but it will put selling pressure on the token nonetheless. $34.5 million in OP set to be unlocked on June 30 | Source: Token Unlocks At the time of writing, the coin is down 10% on the daily chart and 33% on the monthly chart. OP’s price has now fallen to $1.37, a price level that has not been seen since January. This is a 50% decline from its 2023 highs. Related Reading: Here Are The Top 3 Chinese Coins To Buy As China Leads The Bull Run If the bulls fail to recover OP’s price this week, then it could fall below the $1.3 support.

42420334,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUlMgn,1685539325,Crypto Traders Need to Pay Attention to Chinese Yuan,"China's yuan (CNY), one of the five currencies in the International Monetary Fund's special drawing rights basket, has depreciated by 2.7% against the U.S. dollar (USD) this month, its worst performance since September.  Going back to February, the decline goes to 5% versus the greenback, and investment banking giant Goldman Sachs suggests it could drop further.  Historically, yuan devaluation has been considered bullish for fiat currency alternative assets like bitcoin and gold, but the other side of that coin is a strong dollar. The U.S. unit is already on a rising trend and further strength might lead to continued monetary tightening worldwide and a headwind for risk assets, cryptocurrencies among them, say some observers.  The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank, loosely pegs CNY's value to a basket of 24 currencies through a managed-float system. The daily fix or midpoint is set every trading day to provide direction to the market. The currency basket reflects China's trading partners, and with the U.S. being the largest, the dollar has the highest weighting at 19.83%. The euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Australian dollar, Mexican Peso are some of the basket's other currencies.  The PBOC's managed float allows the yuan to fluctuate 2% on either side of daily fix, and the bank manages that band via active buying and selling of yuan. If USD/CNY threatens to rally beyond the 2% limit, for instance, the PBOC sells the dollar and buys yuan to shore up the latter's value. At the same time, the bank buys the dollar against other currencies to keep the proportion of the greenback in reserves stable, ensuring the intervention gets recycled back into other foreign units.  This process inadvertently puts upward pressure on the dollar index, mainly comprised of the euro and the Japanese yen, causing financial tightening worldwide and leading to risk aversion.  ""USD/CNY rally means PBOC will sell the pair to maintain the 2% band and has to buy the dollar against other currencies to maintain a stable proportion of USD in reserves. That pushes up the dollar index, leading to financial tightening and risk aversion,"" David Brickell, director of institutional sales at crypto liquidity network Paradigm, told CoinDesk.  Those with borrowings in the U.S. dollar and receipts in other currencies struggle to service their debt when the dollar surges. Per Brickell, more than $17 trillion of USD debt has been issued outside of the U.S. Thus, dollar strength tends to create risk aversion worldwide.  The dollar index has rallied 2.7% this month. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has declined by 7.3%, its most significant monthly loss since December.  Noelle Acheson, former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading, said that the PBOC's interventions may be dollar bullish but stressed that such actions are not assured.  ""The PBOC has been hinting at more flexibility on the CNY target band than in the past - so it's not a given that it will intervene, especially if a weaker yuan helps exports (which are suffering),"" she wrote in her latest newsletter. ""Now China's priorities are different - also, PBOC has been diversifying reserves and could buy gold instead of more USD.""  Last month, PBOC Governor Yi Gang said that the central bank can wind down regular interventions, providing market forces more leeway in determining the yuan's exchange rate. Yi, however, stressed that the bank retains the right to intervene in times of market turbulence.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/31/crypto-traders-need-to-pay-attention-to-chinese-yuan-heres-why,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c84ffc3141593da6f95c317709dec4455de378cb-1280x704.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BTC, in particular, snapped its six-session winning streak and is on track to log a 7.3% drop for May, marking the worst monthly decline since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ) late last year. China's official NBS Manufacturing PMI unexpectedly fell to a five-month low of 48.8 in May, indicating a faster-than-forecast contraction in the world's second-largest economy's factory activity. U.S. stock index futures also slipped at the time of writing amid growing pessimism on China's economic woes. Among crypto-related stocks driving lower in premarket trading: Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ: COIN ) -3.2% , Marathon Digital ( NASDAQ: MARA ) -2.9% , Hut 8 Mining ( NASDAQ: HUT ) -3.9% , MicroStrategy ( NASDAQ: MSTR ) -2.3% , Bit Digital ( NASDAQ: BTBT ) -5.5% and CleanSpark ( NASDAQ: CLSK ) -3.1% .

13057779,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535815,1685536470,"Bitcoin Wealth Is Transferring From Old To New Hands, Why This Is Positive","On-chain data shows Bitcoin is slowly moving from the old holders to new investors, a sign that could be positive for the market. Bitcoin RHODL Ratio Has Been Climbing Up In Recent Days According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, this kind of trend is usually seen in the middle of cycle transitions. The “Realized HODL (RHODL) ratio” is an indicator that tells us the ratio between the supplies held by the 1-week-old holders and the 1 to 2 years old investors. To be more specific, this indicator doesn’t simply measure the amount of market cap held by these groups, but rather the “realized cap.” This capitalization method calculates the value of the supply by assuming that each coin is worth not the current spot price, but the price at which it was last moved on the blockchain. Here, the 1-week old investors represent the youngest of the BTC participants, who have just bought their coins. Thus, the realized cap held by them provides hints about the wealth owned by the newcomers. The 1-2 years old BTC investors, on the other hand, are a segment of the long-term holders, meaning that they are the more experienced players in the market. Since the RHODL ratio compares the supplies of these young and old holders (though, only some segments of them), it can deliver insight into how these supplies are changing relative to each other. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin RHODL ratio over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As you can see in the above graph, Glassnode has marked the wider trends that the indicator has followed during the previous cycle as well as in the current Bitcoin cycle. It seems like during the bear markets in both the previous and the current cycles, the indicator had been observing a constant downtrend. This means that the young investors had been leaving the market while the long-term holders had been accumulating. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Receive Inflows Of 7,000 BTC, What Does It Mean? This trend makes sense, as the young investors would constantly get into losses during a bear market downtrend, so a lot of them would quickly sell their holdings. Following the bear market bottom formation in the last cycle, the Bitcoin RHODL ratio stopped its decline and soon reversed the trend when some fresh bullish momentum came in the form of the April 2019 rally. A similar trend has also been observed during the current cycle, implying that the bottom after the FTX crash back in November 2022 may have been the bottom after all. Just like during the April 2019 rally, the indicator has been moving up during the current rally. This suggests that new participants are once again interested in accumulating the cryptocurrency.

42420330,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUlMbd,1685535288,Venture Capital Firm Tribe Capital Targets $100M for Latest Crypto Fund: Sources,"Venture capital company Tribe Capital, which has previously backed cryptocurrency firms Kraken and Bitfinex, has introduced a new crypto fund and is targeting a $100 million raise for the fund, sources familiar with the matter told CoinDesk.  San Francisco-based Tribe, which has $1.6 billion in assets under management, plans to make early-stage investments of $500,000-$3 million in layer 1 and 2 ecosystems, decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and infrastructure plays to bring real-world assets on chain, the sources said.  Specifically, Tribe wants to help drive the development of protocols which can provide security, scalability, liquidity and cross-chain compatibility so that the crypto ecosystem garners greater trust, thus fuelling further adoption.  The ""Digital Future Fund I"" follows Tribe's previous cryptocurrency fund, for which it raised $75 million in October 2021.  Venture capital and other investments into crypto companies plunged over 90% in January compared to a year earlier, reflecting the turbulent events of 2022 brought to a head by FTX's collapse in November.  Tribe however may not be particularly phased, despite having held FTX in its portfolio. Instead, it was reportedly considering leading a $250 million fund raise to help the bankrupt exchange restart operations.  The VC did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) ran into selling pressure early Wednesday after a top U.S. Federal Reserve official said there is no compelling case to halt the central bank’s rate hike cycle. The Fed's historic string of monetary tightening has been among the major reasons for continued bear market in cryptocurrencies. ""I don't really see a compelling reason to pause,"" Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester told FT in an interview published on Wednesday. ""I would see more of a compelling case for bringing the rates up and then holding for a while until you get less uncertain about where the economy is going,"" Mester added. Her remarks helped send the U.S. dollar higher and bitcoin lower, with the crypto now off 3% over the last 24-hours to $27,000. Ether is also lower by 2% over that period.  U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) staff are warning companies to be wary of and to actively counter risks from clearing digital asset transactions. The CFTC's Division of Clearing and Risk sent out the advisory on Tuesday, saying it would put a special focus on the emerging risks in crypto in response to an upswing in its supervised entities clearing such trades. These risks include potential conflicts of interest, protections against cyber threats and how firms are managing physical delivery of digital assets in transactions requiring delivery. The agency said it expects companies “to actively identify new, evolving, or unique risks and implement risk mitigation measures tailored to the risks.”  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settled charges with a former Coinbase (COIN) product manager and his brother tied to 2022 allegations of insider trading on certain cryptocurrencies listed by the exchange, the regulator announced Tuesday. Ishan Wahi and his brother Nikhil Wahi were arrested last year on charges of wire fraud conspiracy and wire fraud in connection with a scheme to commit insider trading. On the same day, the SEC brought insider trading charges against the duo. In Tuesday's announcement, the SEC said the brothers agreed to disgorge their gains. Both brothers previously pleaded guilty to the Department of Justice criminal charges, with Ishan Wahi now facing a 2-year sentence and Nikhil Wahi serving a 10-month sentence. The SEC said that the brothers' fines from their criminal case satisfy the civil case's settlements, and it would not seek any other penalties.  Chart of the Day  XRP has risen by more than 8% to $0.51 this month, beating market leaders bitcoin and ether.  ""There has been speculation that the SEC / Ripple legal case could be settled within the next few weeks, which has driven XRP prices higher,"" crypto services provider Matrixport said.  ""A break above resistance at $0.55 could see prices rally to the next key resistance level of $0.80 — which is +44% higher,"" Matrixport added.

CEO Announces Layoffs Blockchain analytics platform Nansen has been the latest to lay off approximately 30% of its employees, seeking to navigate the challenging economic landscape and ensure long-term sustainability. The decision, which the CEO confirmed in a public statement on Monday, comes as the firm aims to cut costs and optimize its operations, especially with the crypto markets running on a continuous slump. Nansen CEO, Alex Svanevik tweeted, “This week we announced the extremely difficult decision to reduce the size of the Nansen team. I’m endlessly grateful to the incredible people we are parting ways with. They will go on to achieve great things, and we'll ensure they get a soft landing, with severance and support.” Nansen To Focus On Core Strategy The announcement statement, penned by Svenavik, claimed that one of the reasons behind the decision was the avalanche effect of the company growing too fast, too soon. Svenavik took responsibility as CEO of the company taking on challenges that was not part of Nansen’s core strategy and promised that the restructuring of the firm would focus on accomplishing less things but to a higher degree of quality. Secondly, the company also cited the less-than-ideal market conditions, claiming that their cost-base was too high relative to the company’s status. Nansen Not Immune To Market Challenges According to LinkedIn data, before the reduction, the company used to employ a 50-100 strong workforce. Major crypto-focused media publications like The Block and Bloomberg have worked with Nansen across major blockchain networks like Polygon and Ethereum. In addition, the firm has been a prominent player in the blockchain analytics industry, specializing in providing insights and intelligence for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystems across over 100 million crypto wallets. The layoffs, however, indicate that Nansen has been impacted by the challenges faced by the broader cryptocurrency market. Despite the rapid growth and innovation in the blockchain industry, the volatility and uncertainty inherent in the market can pose substantial risks to businesses. As such, cost-cutting measures have become necessary for many companies to maintain their financial stability. Mass Layoffs Plague Industry The restructuring efforts at Nansen align with the broader trend of companies in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry taking steps to ensure sustainability. The market's maturity has necessitated a more strategic approach, resulting in mass layoffs and restructuring efforts across the industry. Crypto companies like Polygon, WazirX, and Genesis have been some of the big names that have let go of significant portions of their workforce due to the unfavorable conditions in the market right now. Even entertainment giant Disney had to let go of its entire metaverse team as a part of its efforts to streamline its operations. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

13056402,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535832,1685531421,Shiba Inu: What’s Stifling The Meme Coin From Entering A Bullish Market Phase?,"Shiba Inu (SHIB), a popular cryptocurrency known for its vibrant online community and adorable dog-inspired branding, is currently facing a liquidity crisis. The situation has been persistent, with no signs of immediate improvement. Despite its initial success and enthusiastic following, Shiba Inu has encountered challenges related to liquidity, which refers to the ease of buying or selling an asset without causing significant price fluctuations. Liquidity crises can arise when there is an insufficient number of buyers or sellers in the market, leading to increased volatility and potential difficulties in executing trades. Related Reading: Pepecoin Eyes Rebound As It Finds Support In Strong Algorithm Data Score Constrained Volume And Diminished Stability The meme coin finds itself entangled in a liquidity crisis, which is primarily characterized by restricted availability of its tradable tokens. Insufficient liquidity jeopardizes the stability of the asset, creating a discouraging environment for potential investors and causing existing holders to reconsider their positions. As a result, SHIB’s upward price momentum is stifled, impeding its progress, and hindering its ability to enter an uptrend. Related Reading: Floki Inu: Does Meme Coin Have What It Takes To Re-Enter Top 100 Spot? Underwhelming APYs Adding to the liquidity challenges, the liquidity pools associated with SHIB offer unimpressive Annual Percentage Yields (APYs). These lackluster returns serve as an additional burden for liquidity providers, as they are not sufficiently incentivized to stake their SHIB tokens in decentralized finance (DeFi) pools. The unappealing APYs further contribute to the scarcity of liquidity, exacerbating SHIB’s liquidity crisis. Low TVL: A Sign Of Investor Mistrust The Total Value Locked (TVL), which represents the total assets staked in SHIB’s network or DeFi protocols, is another worrying aspect of the liquidity crisis. A low TVL indicates diminished activity within the network and is often interpreted as a lack of investor trust in the asset’s potential for generating yield. This lack of engagement from investors acts as a deterrent, impeding the inflow of new capital into SHIB and subsequently curbing its price growth. Shiba Inu Price Shiba Inu’s price on CoinGecko stands at a minuscule $0.00000853, experiencing a 2.3% dip over the past 24 hours and a gradual seven-day decline of 1.6%. Source: Coingecko Shiba Inu’s liquidity crisis has undoubtedly posed challenges to its stability and growth. Nevertheless, with a dedicated community and a proactive approach, the path to overcoming these obstacles can be paved. By fostering a robust and liquid market, Shiba Inu can regain investor trust, attract new users, and stimulate price growth. As the journey unfolds, the cryptocurrency world watches with anticipation to see how Shiba Inu will navigate its liquidity challenges and continue its quest for success in the ever-evolving digital landscape.

Called GNT V3, the tool aims to place creativity within the technological intersections of AI and Web3. Working in collaboration with MOOAR, FSL’s recently-released NFT marketplace, GNT V3 takes a user’s selfie as input to create AI-generated images that are minted on the Solana blockchain.  Yawn Rong, co-founder of FSL, said in a press release that GNT V3 has the capability to redefine digital identity in Web3.  “This is the advent of a new era of Web3 technology, where individuality merges with blockchain technology to redefine personal expression,” said Rong. “With GNT, we're pushing the boundaries of digital self-expression and enabling users to become creators of their own unique digital masterpieces, ready to be showcased and monetized in the vibrant Web3 ecosystem.”  Last month, FSL released GNT V1, which allowed artists to mint individual NFTs on the MOOAR marketplace. Later in April, it rolled out GNT V2, which improved its AI model.  “The world is discovering the pros and cons of AI technology, but we have been working for months to do something novel with the tech,” said Jerry Huang, FSL co-founder, in a press release.

It has always been so, that anyone who uses anything else other than a government-backed currency to make a transaction is considered to have broken the law, and is normally heavily sanctioned compared to other far more heinous crimes, depending on the country in which they reside. In this particular case, police in Bali carried out an undercover operation in order to expose the illegal transactions that were being made, i.e., taking payments in crypto in exchange for car rentals. The police set up the car rental owner by first infiltrating a Telegram group and then asked the suspect for a wallet address for crypto payment. In a subsequent meeting to finalise the deal the business owner was arrested and his mobile phone was seized as well as other possessions. If proven guilty, the punishment meted out by Indonesian courts for such an offence is up to one year in prison, and a fine of IDR 200 million (US$13,337). According to Coconuts Bali, Nanang Prihasmoko, the Bali Crime Investigation Unit Chief, said of the incident: “We encourage the use of the Indonesian rupiah because it is the only currency in Indonesia, and we must conduct transactions with it,” Opinion On the face of it, requiring citizens to transact in the officially recognised currency of the land appears to be not only sensible but laudable, given that the use of other, non-official currencies, can take away from the official currency, and over time confidence in it can erode. However, as the following chart demonstrates, the Indonesian rupiah is not maintaining its value. The chart is for the price of gold in kilograms against the Indonesian rupiah over the last 15 years. It can be seen that the rupiah has fallen around 400% to gold in this time. Source: Goldprice.org Every fiat currency in the world is also suffering a similar fate, leading to vastly reduced purchasing power for citizens of all countries. The question is whether citizens should agree to allow their governments to continue to prop up banks and save in rapidly devaluing currencies. The fiat currency experiment has failed on the most spectacular level. This being said, governments and banks have locked their citizens into this system with very few escape routes out. Crypto, gold, and silver are those routes out, so stand by for them to become ever more difficult to purchase. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The announcement was made on the 30th of May. ByBit joins a growing list of cryptocurrency exchanges that are exiting Canada, citing an unfavorable regulatory environment. ByBit To Shutter Canadian Operations ByBit added that Canadian users would be unable to access any services and products offered by the exchange. Furthermore, Canadian users will also be unable to open new accounts on the exchange starting from the 31st of May. The exchange announced the news in a blog post, stating, “It has always been Bybit’s primary objective to operate our business in compliance with all relevant rules and regulations in Canada. In light of recent regulatory development, Bybit has made the difficult but necessary decision to pause the availability of our products and services.” Additionally, existing users will not be able to trade or make deposits on the platform after the 31st of July, 2023. The exchange also asked its users in Canada to close out their positions by the 30th of September. Failure to wind down the positions would result in the automatic liquidation of any and all positions in both derivative contracts and margin products. “Canadian Customers who are implicated by these measures should take steps by the 30th of September, 2023, 8 AM UTC, to wind down and manage their positions. Failing which, open positions in any margin products and derivative contracts, including the following products listed below, will be liquidated, and the liquidated funds will be available for withdrawal.” A Mass Exodus ByBit becomes the latest in a long line of cryptocurrency exchanges that have chosen to leave the Canadian markets, citing the unfavorable regulatory environment prevailing in the country. Canada had imposed several new regulations on the crypto industry in the country and given exchanges the option of complying with them or leaving the markets. The new rules bar crypto exchanges from offering any type of leverage, including margin and credit. Furthermore, exchanges were also prevented from allowing the purchase or deposit of stablecoins without obtaining prior written consent from regulators, leading to a de-facto ban on stablecoins in the country. This de-facto ban on stablecoins is the primary driver of the mass exodus of cryptocurrency exchanges from the country. Some of the notable exits include Paxos, dYdX, Bittrex, OKX, and Binance. Binance had halted its services for Canadian users under similar circumstances back in May, stating that the current regulatory landscape made operations unfavorable. The exchange had stated at the time, “Unfortunately, new guidance related to stablecoins and investor limits provided to crypto exchanges makes the Canadian market no longer tenable for Binance at this time. We put off this decision as long as we could to explore other reasonable avenues to protect our Canadian users, but it has become apparent that there are none.” OKX had announced the suspension of services in Canada as early as March. This was followed by dYdX and Paxos in April, with both announcing they were withdrawing from the Canadian markets. Not All Exchanges Eying An Exit However, not all exchanges are looking to exit the Canadian markets and have decided to comply with the new regulations, despite the restrictions. Kraken and Coinbase are two of the major exchanges that have pledged to continue operations in Canada and have gone on record to state they would comply with the new rules. Coinbase Canada, the exchange’s Canadian arm, has signed a pre-registration undertaking (PRU) with regulators and has pledged to help create a strong regulatory framework. “We applaud the Canadian securities regulators’ efforts to bring clarity to the industry and look forward to continuing our collaboration with them on regulation that protects consumers while embracing innovation.” Coinbase vice-president of international and business development, Nana Murugesan, stated that the Canadian approach to crypto is better than America’s because the rules are clearly defined. “There’s a couple of ways we see regulators acting: one is regulation by engagement; the other one is regulation by enforcement. The latter part is tough because you don’t know what the rules are. But the Canadian regulator is definitely the former, which is regulation by engagement – which we love.” Kraken also made its intention of staying in the Canadian markets clear by announcing that it had filed a PRU with Canadian regulators. Kraken pointed out an OSC survey stating that 31% of Canadians planned to buy crypto next year as the main reason to stay in the market. Other exchanges that have filed a PRU with Canadian regulators include Gemini, Shakepay, and BitBuy. BitBuy is one of the top exchanges in Canada and was brought under the regulatory umbrella much before others, such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Gemini.

13053673,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535797,1685521594,Litecoin (LTC) Remains Red Despite Surge In Network Ahead Of Halving,"As the countdown to Litecoin’s highly anticipated third mining reward halving begins, the cryptocurrency has witnessed a surge in network activity, indicating growing investor interest. However, despite this update, Litecoin hasn’t seen any significant movement in the past 24 hours but instead has remained in the red. Litecoin’s upcoming halving, scheduled for early August, will see the block reward slashed by 50% to 6.25 LTC, setting the stage for potential price impacts and market shifts. Following its latest decline, various on-chain metrics and indicators have painted a positive picture for Litecoin’s network, suggesting a promising future for the popular altcoin. Onchain Activity Sees Surge According to recent data from IntoTheBlock, Litecoin has recorded an uptick in on-chain activity. Since the end of April, the total count of addresses holding a balance has experienced a surge, reaching a significant milestone of 8.5 million LTC addresses last week. Related Reading: Why Litecoin Is The Most Undervalued Asset in Crypto This surge in active addresses not only demonstrates the growing popularity of Litecoin but also highlights the expanding user base and interest in cryptocurrency. Moreover, Litecoin number of new addresses being created and the count of active addresses have approached close to all-time highs, slightly surpassing the creation of new Bitcoin addresses. This achievement underlines Litecoin’s robust network growth and the increasing adoption of the altcoin within the crypto community. The heightened on-chain volume has caught the attention of the crypto analytics platform Santiment, indicating that prominent market participants may be strategically positioning themselves in LTC investments ahead of the halving event. Santiment noted: If this trend of increased on-chain volume continues, it will absolutely be a strong sign that some big players are beginning to jump in on their LTC investments in anticipation of the halving. Litecoin Remains In The Red Despite the surge in network activity, Litecoin (LTC) price has not seen any notable movement in the market in the past 24 hours but instead a continuous downtrend. Over the past 24 hours, Litecoin has seen a 2.2% loss from its value. At the time of writing, Litecoin currently trades at $89.38 after trading slightly above $90 on Tuesday. LTC’s trading volume has plunged a bit from $700 million last Thursday to $578 million in the past 24 hours indicating less trading activity. Related Reading: Litecoin Surpasses $90, But This Level Remains Crucial For The Altcoin It is worth noting, however, that LTC is up 3.4% in the past week with a market cap up by more than $200 million in the same period. Meanwhile, Litecoin’s hash rate, a measure of the computational power dedicated to the network’s mining operations, has demonstrated consistency. Despite minor fluctuations, the processing power devoted to Litecoin’s blockchain has witnessed a surge of over 24% since the beginning of the year, currently standing at 714 TH/s. This upward trend not only enhances network security but also signifies the confidence and commitment of miners in supporting Litecoin’s ecosystem.

The announcement comes on the heels of the stablecoin issuer stating that it would begin to purchase Bitcoin at regular intervals using its profits. Tether’s Foray Into Mining The company announced that it would soon begin mining operations in the country and has entered into a partnership with a local licensed company. However, Tether has not shared the name or any other details regarding the local entity. The news about the company’s entry into the mining space comes soon after it announced that it would invest around 15% of its profits into purchasing Bitcoin in an effort to strengthen its reserves, similar to strategies adopted by Tesla and MicroStrategy. The announcement also indicates that Tether is bullish about the prospects of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. CTO of Tether Paolo Ardonio stated in the announcement, “By harnessing the power of Bitcoin and Uruguay’s renewable energy capabilities, Tether is leading the way in sustainable and responsible Bitcoin mining. Our unwavering commitment to renewable energy ensures that every Bitcoin we mine leaves a minimal ecological footprint while upholding the security and integrity of the Bitcoin network.” Tether also added that it is on the lookout for experts to help the company expand its footprint in the renewable energy space. Bitcoin mining is extremely energy intensive and relies on a distributed global network of computers to verify transactions and release new Bitcoin tokens into circulation. Is Uruguay The Ideal Location? Tether also shared its reasoning behind choosing Uruguay to set up its Bitcoin mining operations. In its announcement, Tether stated that the South American country had emerged as a major global leader in renewable energy. In fact, the country has generated 94% of its electricity from renewable sources such as solar power and wind energy. Tether stated in its announcement, “Blessed with abundant natural resources, Uruguay offers ideal conditions for the production of renewable energy, facilitating the establishment of wind farms, solar parks, and hydropower projects, guaranteeing a consistent supply of clean and environmentally friendly energy.” Tether is also looking to hire people in various roles in its new Bitcoin mining and energy venture and plans to expand its Bitcoin mining operations to several other countries. Tether’s Controversial Past Tether is the entity that issues the USDT, which is the largest stablecoin in the crypto market, with a circulating supply of 83,184,323,408 USDT. It competes with other major stablecoins in the market, such as Binance’s BUSD and Circle’s USDC stablecoins. According to Tether, each of its USDT stablecoins is backed in a 1:1 ratio by US-denominated assets held in reserve. However, the company has gotten into trouble with regulators, with several questions raised about the integrity of the assets backing the stablecoin. Previously, Tether held all its reserve assets in the form of reserve paper, which is a less liquid form of corporate debt. However, the company has since replaced all the commercial paper held by it with US Treasuries. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42420335,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUlMir,1685517988,Bitcoin Recedes to $27K as Fed's Mester Favors Unabated Tightening,"Bitcoin (BTC) ran into selling pressure early Wednesday after a top Federal Reserve (Fed) official said there is no compelling case to halt the liquidity tightening. The Fed's unrelenting tightening has roiled risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  ""I don't really see a compelling reason to pause,"" Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester told FT in an interview published on Wednesday. ""I would see more of a compelling case for bringing the rates up and then holding for a while until you get less uncertain about where the economy is going,"" Mester added.  The weak China data released early Wednesday likely added to bearish pressures around bitcoin and other risk assets. China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index for may came in at 48.8 against a forecast of 49.4, signaling signaling a faster-than-expected contraction in the manufacturing activity in the world's second-largest economy.  Bitcoin, a pure play on the dollar liquidity, fell by nearly 2% to $27,021 after Mester's comments were published, CoinDesk data shows.  Futures tied to Wall Street's tech-heavy index Nasdaq fell by 0.38%, hinting at a negative open on Wednesday. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, rose 0.27% to 104.40. Gold remained resilient, trading 0.2% higher at $1,962 per ounce.  The Fed has raised rates by 500 basis points to 5% since March 2022 to tame inflation. Mester's support for another rate hike and the higher-for-longer stance comes on the heels of hotter-than-expected inflation data and validates the recent hawkish repricing of interest rate expectations in the U.S.  Official data released last Friday showed the consumer spending in the U.S. increased more than expected in April even as the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core PCE rose to 4.4% on a yearly basis in April from 4.2% in March. Per the Fed funds futures, traders no longer expect the Fed to cut rates this year and have fully priced in a 25 basis point rate hike for June.  Over the past seven months, traders consistently hoped that the Fed would pause its rate hikes in the first half of 2023 and resort to liquidity-boosting rate cuts in the second half. That's one of the significant reasons behind bitcoin's year-to-date gain of over 65%. The cryptocurrency clocked a 10-month high of $31,000 in April. The dollar index dropped by over 12% in the seven months to April.  Mester added that the debt ceiling deal removes a ""big piece of uncertainty"" from the U.S. economy.  Over the weekend, U.S. President Joe Biden and the House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, reached a tentative deal to suspend the $31.4 trillion and avoid a default. The lawmakers now need to push the deal through the House and the Senate to avoid a default.  Analysts told CoinDesk that once the deal is approved, the Treasury would begin refilling its coffers by issuing bonds and, in the process, sucking out the dollar liquidity from the system. That would be bearish for risk assets, in general.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: A new report from K33 highlights heightened volatility in Bitcoin and Ether in 2023, despite a slow start to the year.

Good morning Asia,  Bitcoin is opening the East Asia trading day at $27,686, down 0.2% while Ether is at $1,901, up 0.4%.  2023 has been an odd year for crypto. In December, during the depths of crypto winter, the price predictions for bitcoin were pretty grim. $10-12K by the first quarter of 2023, said VanEck.  But a lot has happened since then. Ordinals, bank failure, a liquidity crisis.  Between March and mid-May, the market was fairly stale, and bitcoin barely moved.  A new report from K33 Research says this is beginning to change.  Bitcoin's trading range fluctuated between $25,800 and $28,000 over the last week amid increased volatility. The variation was fueled by a prospective debt ceiling agreement, prompting market rallies, increased Bitcoin dominance and trading volumes, and may lead to more market activity due to Asian regulatory changes and Recep Erdogan's re-election as president of Turkey, K33 said in the report.  K33 said that this surge was partially amplified by over-leveraged shorts creating a decrease in open interest. At the same time, progress in U.S. debt ceiling negotiations spurred a rally in the crypto and U.S. equities markets.  All of this, they say, along with the transformation in the crypto market structure with stablecoins and ether gaining prominence, and bitcoin's increased yet comparatively lower dominance, indicates a resemblance to the previous bear market with potentially insufficient de-risk rotation.  The cure for all of this is more liquidity, but that’s nowhere in sight.  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector XRP XRP +4.6% Currency Solana SOL +3.4% Smart Contract Platform Stellar XLM +1.8% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Dogecoin DOGE −1.3% Currency Polygon MATIC −0.8% Smart Contract Platform Chainlink LINK −0.6% Computing  Insights  Could Ether Be the Next Market Driver?  Ether is set to end May flat, down 0.3%, while bitcoin, against ether, is down nearly 7%.  Indeed, bitcoin is on track for its first monthly loss since December, as CoinDesk previously reported, primarily due to the increased likelihood that the U.S. central bank will maintain elevated interest rates, boosting the U.S. dollar and causing a decline in the crypto market.  Experts suggest that the market needs a new driver to lift prices higher.  Ether has that driver.  During the last month, over 143,830 ether worth $275 million has been burnt, according to tracker ultrasound.money.  Ether is well into its deflationary stage, with a negative supply growth of 1.46% per year. The network is forecasted by the tracker to burn 2,441,000 ether this year, or approximately $4.5 billion worth.  In contrast, if Ethereum stayed on as a Proof of Work protocol, it would be on track for supply growth of 2%, the tracker shows.  Data shows that because of Ethereum's deflationary stance, ether and bitcoin are breaking their correlation.  The positive correlation between the two digital assets has weakened this year, suggesting a long-lasting market shift where they operate more independently due to diverging supply-demand economics.  ""What we are seeing could be the beginning of a long-term regime change. As Ethereum has shifted from PoW to PoS, the economics of supply and demand underlying the two tokens will continue to diverge,"" Pulkit Goyal, Vice President of trading at OrBit Markets, previously told CoinDesk.  Over 13% of all ether in existence has been staked, according to CryptoQuant data, leading to ether balances on exchanges hitting all-time lows.  Ether is up 2.8% over the last week, while bitcoin has lagged behind, up only 2% during the same period.  Important events.

In this article, we will explore three notable developments: Big Eyes Coin (BIG) gearing up for its June 15 launch, HedgeUp (HDUP) presale attracts Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR) whales, and the potential bounce in Stellar (XLM) price despite its fragile outlook. These developments offer unique perspectives on the cryptocurrency landscape and highlight the opportunities and challenges that investors may encounter. Big Eyes Coin Unpacks The Power Of Memes To Build An Ecosystem For Success Big Eyes Coin is set to launch on June 15, following a successful presale campaign that edges closer to raising $50 million. $BIG stands out as a meme token, featuring an adorable cat as its central theme. With impressive presale performance and strong community support, BIG is poised for growth and has attracted significant attention. The upcoming launch presents an opportunity for investors to participate in a project that has already generated substantial interest and funding. The token's integration of a casino and its approach to building a dedicated ecosystem add further appeal to the investment proposition. The presale for $BIG is coming to an end on June 3rd with the available token supply predicted to be sold out in the next 48 hours. The current presale valuation is locked in at $0.00017 with the valuation expected to increase by 250% or $0.0006. HedgeUp Empowers Traders With Asset-Backed Trading HedgeUp is an emerging trading platform that introduces the concept of asset-backed trading. Its recent presale has garnered attention from influential Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR) whales, renowned for their strategic investments and ability to influence market trends. The unique value proposition of HedgeUp, along with its potential for high returns, has attracted these whales, who see it as a groundbreaking project. Bitcoin whales, in particular, are interested in projects that can replicate or surpass the success of Bitcoin. HedgeUp's commitment to security and its innovative approach to trading make it an enticing option for investors seeking both risk mitigation and profitability. Stellar In Search For A Short-Term Rebound Amidst Long-Term Uncertainty Despite a decline in the Stellar (XLM) price since April and a fragile outlook in the long term, there are indications of a potential bounce in the short term. Stellar lost a crucial horizontal area during its downward movement, but the short-term chart suggests the possibility of a rebound. While the long-term readings remain bearish, traders and investors are closely watching for any signs of a bounce. Stellar's underlying technology and partnerships continue to drive interest, and a short-term recovery could provide an opportunity for those looking to capitalize on market movements. Crypto Market Relishes HedgeUp Presale Offer, BIG Launch, and Hopeful Stellar These three developments reflect the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market, offering investors diverse opportunities and challenges. Big Eyes Coin's impending launch and successful presale demonstrate the potential for meme tokens to capture the market's attention and generate significant funding. HedgeUp's attracting of Bitcoin and Monero whales underscores the appeal of asset-backed trading platforms and the search for high returns among seasoned investors. Stellar's price dynamics highlight the volatility and potential for short-term rebounds, while also emphasizing the importance of long-term outlooks and technological advancements. Conclusion The world of cryptocurrencies continues to evolve, presenting exciting developments and opportunities for investors. Big Eyes Coin, HedgeUp, and Stellar exemplify the diverse projects and trends within the market. From meme tokens to asset-backed trading platforms and established cryptocurrencies, each presents its unique value proposition and challenges. As investors navigate this landscape, conducting thorough research and staying informed about market trends is crucial. The cryptocurrency market remains dynamic, and prudent decision-making is vital to success.
