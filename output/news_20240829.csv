32978724,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638591,1724972409,Bitcoin‚Äôs Momentum at Risk? NVT Golden Cross Sends Warning Signals,"Bitcoin price action despite being wobbly in the past days, is still being discussed by analysts. Earlier today, a CryptoQuant analyst turned the spotlight to the Bitcoin‚Äôs NVT Golden Cross, a metric that has been known to signal potential local tops and bottoms in Bitcoin‚Äôs price. According to the analyst, Burak Kesmeci, this metric is now showing a reason for concern as it is currently struggling to surpass its previous peaks. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Sudden Drop: Could This Be a Setup for a Massive Rally? Analyst Weighs In How Is The NVT Golden Cross Signalling a Warning For Bitcoin? To answer this question, it is worth first understanding what the NVT Goden Cross means. Notably, the NVT (Network Value to Transactions) Golden Cross is a major metric used to determine the health of Bitcoin‚Äôs market. It is calculated by dividing the network value (market cap) by the daily transaction volume, and then applying a moving average to this ratio. Traditionally, when the NVT Golden Cross rises above 2.2 points, it signals a local top, while dropping below -1.7 points indicates a local bottom. According to the report shared by the CryptoQuant analyst, the NVT Golden Cross has been showing a concerning trend over the past few months. The metric has consistently failed to surpass its previous peaks, which has historically been a bearish sign. Since March 2024, the peaks of the NVT Golden Cross have been steadily declining. Kesmeci disclosed that on March 31, the metric plunged to 3.17, on April 29, it decreased to 3.08, on May 27: 2.67, on July 29: 2.03 and on August 26: 1.46. According to Kesmeci, this declining trend suggests that the current uptrend in Bitcoin‚Äôs price may be losing steam. The analyst noted: It seems that for the momentum to be regained, the NVT Golden Cross needs to surpass the previous peak and bring the bulls behind it. Outlook On BTC Future Despite the cautionary signals from the NVT Golden Cross, not all analysts are sounding the alarm. Prominent crypto analyst Ash Crypto recently shared a more optimistic outlook on X, suggesting that the current price dips should be viewed within the context of a broader bullish pattern. Ash Crypto emphasized that the Bitcoin bull-flag pattern remains intact and that investors should focus on long-term charts rather than short-term volatility. Ash Crypto further supported his bullish stance by pointing to global liquidity metrics.

42417308,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTY5Eb,1724968091,U.S. House Committee Plans for Heap of Crypto Hearings in September,"The U.S. House of Representatives' financial-services committee is said to be tackling a ton of crypto issues next month, including DeFi and Securities and Exchange Commission matters.  Digital assets will likely be a hot topic for SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who is said to be scheduled to face the entire committee later in September.  The U.S. House Financial Services Committee is poised to launch a series of crypto hearings digging into several aspects of the industry, according to a person briefed on the planning, including decentralized finance (DeFi), the Securities and Exchange Commission's oversight of digital assets businesses and the implications of ""pig butchering"" scams.  The congressional panel, which has oversight over U.S. securities and most financial products, will set a September hearing calendar jammed with crypto-relevant topics, the person said. The committee chairman, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), is retiring at the end of the year and has said one of his top remaining priorities is finishing one of the bills to begin establishing tailored federal rules for crypto.  The first of the hearings on Sept. 10 will be a long-awaited subcommittee examination of DeFi, an aspect of the crypto industry that's received mostly negative attention from regulators to date. A number of proposed rules at various federal agencies could have existential consequences for DeFi projects, including at the SEC and Internal Revenue Service.  Read More: U.S. Treasury Issues Crypto Tax Regime For 2025, Delays Rules for Non-Custodians  A busy day on Sept. 18 will feature two hearings ‚Äì one in the morning on the enforcement practices of the SEC and one later on the implications of so-called pig butchering, the practice of posing as a romantic partner to scam people out of their assets.  But a full-committee hearing on Sept. 23 could carry the most crypto weight, with the SEC set to testify. The House panel is said to be seeking testimony from Chair Gary Gensler and the rest of the five-member commission in the same hearing ‚Äì a highly unusual approach.  They'd appear just as the lawmakers are also negotiating legislation that could seek to hem in the agency's digital assets jurisdiction in favor of casting the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in a more prominent role. The possibility of crypto legislation remains dicey this year, though the calendar includes time for work on bills, and prominent lawmakers ‚Äì including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) ‚Äì keep saying they intend to get something done.

Last week, Salame‚Äôs lawyers filed a petition with the court stating that prosecutors had obtained his guilty plea improperly, getting him to agree to plead guilty by dangling promises that they would cease their investigations into Michelle Bond, Salame‚Äôs long-time partner and the mother of his young child.  In an order published Thursday night, Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled that he would still hold a hearing on the original petition regardless of Salame's motion to withdraw it. The judge made Salame's attendance at the hearing a part of his bail conditions.  Read more: Former FTX Executive Ryan Salame Claims Government Backtracked on Plea Deal  Salame‚Äôs petition was filed one day before charges against Bond were made public. Bond, a former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawyer who spent years leading a D.C.-based crypto advocacy group, was indicted in federal court on Aug. 22 for taking illegal campaign contributions from Salame and other FTX employees during her failed 2022 run for a Congressional seat.  According to the petition, prosecutors threatened Bond during plea negotiations and implied that it would ‚Äúdiscontinue investigating Bond if Salame pleaded guilty.‚Äù  Now that Bond has been indicted, however, Salame is changing course.  ‚ÄúMr. Salame is withdrawing the Petition so that Ms. Bond may raise the matter in her proceeding,‚Äù Salame‚Äôs lawyers wrote in the new court documents. ‚ÄúTo be clear, Mr. Salame stands by the facts set forth in the Petition and his accompanying declaration. Mr. Salame is withdrawing the Petition, however, to allow the facts to be developed by Ms. Bond, and a ruling to be made in her case.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSince the primary relief sought in the Petition is dismissal of the indictment against Ms. Bond, it makes sense to adjudicate the issues raised in the Petition in the docket in which the indictment is pending,‚Äù Salame‚Äôs lawyers added.  Bond appeared before a magistrate judge in the Southern District of New York (SDNY) on Aug. 22 and was released on a $1 million bond.  She has been charged with four counts related to the alleged campaign finance violations ‚Äì one count of conspiracy to cause unlawful political contributions, one count of causing and accepting excessive campaign contributions, one count of causing and receiving an unlawful corporate contribution, and one count of causing and receiving a conduit contribution.

Local media reports indicate that Indonesia is contemplating a ban on Telegram due to its alleged facilitation of pornography and online gambling activities. Global Scrutiny On Telegram According to a local media report, Indonesian Communication and Informatics Minister Budi Arie Setiadi has voiced strong concerns, stating that the Ministry has already warned Telegram about its content moderation practices. Per the report, Minister Budi Setiadi emphasized that if evidence of illegal content is confirmed, the government would take decisive action to block the platform. This intensifying legal scrutiny comes on the heels of a troubling incident in Central Java, where a 20-year-old resident, identified as ‚ÄúMAFA,‚Äù was arrested for allegedly managing a child pornography group on Telegram. The Indonesian authorities are reportedly monitoring the platform for further violations. Related Reading: Solana Price (SOL) Slips: Will a Break Below $140 Trigger More Downside? In France, Durov‚Äôs legal troubles have deepened since his arrest at Le Bourget Airport. The Paris prosecutor‚Äôs office has reported that he faces 12 serious charges, including complicity in child pornography sales, drug trafficking, fraud, and failure to cooperate with investigations. Durov has since been granted bail under strict conditions: he must pay ‚Ç¨5 million, report to police twice a week, and remain within French territory. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau confirmed that there are sufficient grounds to investigate Durov on all charges related to his initial arrest. However, the legal challenges for Telegram extend beyond France and Indonesia, as the Indian government has also launched an investigation into the platform. As reported by NewsBTC, authorities in India are examining claims that Telegram is being used for criminal activities, including extortion and gambling. Similar to investigations underway in France and Indonesia, the messaging platform could face potential bans in these countries. TON Price Continues To Struggle Toncoin (TON) plunged about 20% after Durov was arrested outside Paris on August 24, before paring some of those losses. TON‚Äôs total value locked (TVL) has fallen to $357 million from a high of $769 reached in July, according to data provider DefiLlama. In the wake of this price crash, certain Toncoin supporters perceived an opportunity amidst the chaos. DWF Labs, a crypto market maker with a stake in the token, seized the moment to invest ‚Äúmillions‚Äù of dollars in Toncoin following the decline, as confirmed by co-founder Eugene Ng to Bloomberg. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forecast: Expert Reveals 4 Reasons To Be Bullish On Q4 Despite the efforts to stabilize Toncoin‚Äôs value, the cryptocurrency has struggled to regain its footing. The TON price has continued its downward trajectory, showing no signs of recovery with a further 1% drop in the 24-hour timeframe. The token has sustained substantial losses over the past month, amounting to nearly 17%, currently trading at $5.54. In case of further price retracements, bullish investors will need to keep a close eye on the $5.15 and $4.87 marks, the largest support levels for the token on its daily TON/USDT chart.

32974948,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638580,1724961620,Ethereum Will Remain Bearish Until This Key Trading Reading Changes,"Ethereum is steady at press time, as is visible in the daily chart. Even though prices are floating above $2,500, ETH bulls are still weak. The coin remains inside the bear bar of August 27, technically inside a bear formation. From price action, it would take effort for bulls to take charge in the short term. A convincing high volume close above $3,500 would signal a rapid trend shift beneficial for holders. Will Ethereum Bears Press On? Traders Monitoring This Reading Before then, one analyst thinks the short to medium term projection for the second most valuable coin is bearish. In an analysis, citing CryptoQuant data, the analyst said over the last few months, the funding rate in Ethereum perpetuals across exchanges like Binance and OKX has been positive but falling. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Could Drop To $8 If It Loses Current Support: On-Chain Data Reveals Through perpetual platforms, Ethereum traders can place positions using leverage, essentially borrowing from the exchange. The more leverage they have, the more they have to borrow, narrowing their safety margin and increasing the risk of liquidation. Depending on the prevailing price action, the funding rate in these perpetual markets can be positive or negative. Whenever the funding rate is positive, the outlook among leveraged traders is bullish. In this case, they expect prices to rise higher. For equilibrium, traders posting long positions have to pay those who are selling. Conversely, a negative funding rate means the prevailing sentiment is bearish, and the markets could fall further. In this event, short sellers must pay those posting buys. Looking at the price trend over the past few months, the analyst notes that the funding rate for Ethereum perpetuals has been consistently falling, though still in the positive territory. This state of affairs means that, though ETH has been wavy, moving even to $3,900 in May, the dominant sentiment is bearish. Eyes On Spot ETF Net Inflows For Growth Therefore, for the trend to change, there must be a sharp spike in buying interest. In turn, this will also help lift prices and funding rate across these perpetual platforms. Related Reading: Dogwifhat On The Edge: Can WIF Hold Above $1.47 As Bears Close In? Rising funding rates will signal a shift in trend, helping spur demand. One of the many factors that may drive prices is inflows to spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States. According to Soso Value, all spot Ethereum ETF issuers in the country recorded net inflows of over $5.8 million. Still, this reading is way lower than what was seen in late July.

32973092,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638483,1724956205,Polygon On-Chain Activity Lights Up: MATIC Reversal Incoming?,"On-chain data shows that some activity metrics related to Polygon have surged recently, which could be positive for the asset‚Äôs price. Polygon Active Addresses & Age Consumed Have Spiked Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment¬†discussed the latest trend in two MATIC indicators. The first¬†is the ‚ÄúDaily Active Addresses,‚Äù which tracks¬†the total number of addresses participating in some kind of transaction activity on the network every day. The unique number of active addresses can be considered the same as the unique number of users participating in network activities, so the value of this metric tells us about the amount of traffic that the blockchain is observing right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plummets To $59,000, On-Chain Data Reveals Why When the indicator‚Äôs value rises, more users are becoming active on the network. Such a trend implies that cryptocurrency is attractive to investors. On the other hand, the metric registering a decline suggests investor interest in the asset could be declining as fewer users make transfers on the blockchain. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Daily Active Addresses for Polygon over the past few months: The above graph shows that the Polygon Daily Active Addresses has recently experienced a surge. At the peak of the latest spike, 3,369 MATIC addresses made transactions on the network, the second-highest value for the year. Thus, investors appear to have been actively engaged on the network recently. It can generally be hard to say what the consequences of such activity may be for the asset, as both selling and buying activity would be flagged up in the indicator. One thing that can generally be said is that high user activity may lead to¬†cryptocurrency volatility. In the current case, though, there may be one other hint:¬†the surrounding price action. Interestingly, the largest spike in the indicator only came just after MATIC‚Äôs latest price decline, which could imply that investors may be rushing to buy the dip. If this is the case, then Polygon could benefit from a turnaround in the activity. The second indicator in the chart is the ‚ÄúAge Consumed,‚Äù which tells us whether dormant coins are on the move. From the chart, it‚Äôs visible that a large number of old tokens appear to have moved on the network during the latest activity rush. This can be a mixed signal, as it could suggest¬†that the asset‚Äôs¬†diamond hands are selling. It‚Äôs also possible that these investors have only shifted the coins for some other activity, as the last Age Consumed spike of a similar scale proved bullish for Polygon. Related Reading: Litecoin Sees Sudden Exodus Of Retail Investors: Why This Can Be Bullish Given the spikes these on-chain indicators have witnessed, how the coin develops from here remains to be seen.

Solana‚Äôs Rollercoaster: Highs, Lows, and What‚Äôs Next Solana (SOL) has had a remarkable run, establishing itself as one of the leading layer-1 blockchains in the crypto space. Known for its high-speed transactions and low fees, Solana (SOL) has been a favorite among developers and investors alike. However, recent data suggests that Solana (SOL)‚Äôs dominance may be waning. Daily transaction fees on the Solana (SOL) network have dropped by 65% compared to their August highs, signaling a potential slowdown in network activity. This decline comes amid growing competition from other blockchains like BNB Smart Chain and Tron, both of which are making bold moves to dethrone Solana (SOL). Despite these challenges, Solana (SOL) remains a strong contender in the market. Analysts continue to predict significant growth for SOL, with some even forecasting a 10x increase in value over the next year. However, with Solana (SOL)‚Äôs daily transaction fees at their lowest levels since May 2024, investors are beginning to explore alternative options to ensure they stay ahead of the curve. Enter Mpeppe: A Rising Star in the Crypto Universe While Solana (SOL) faces its ups and downs, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is making waves as a promising new altcoin with the potential to deliver substantial returns. Currently in its presale stage, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has already captured the attention of savvy investors who recognize its potential for long-term growth. Priced at just $0.001777, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an attractive entry point for those looking to get in early on what could be the next big thing in the crypto world. Mpeppe (MPEPE)‚Äôs explosive growth can be attributed to its unique value proposition. Unlike many other altcoins that rely solely on hype, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is building a robust ecosystem designed to support long-term sustainability and user engagement. The project‚Äôs viral marketing campaigns and strong community support have already led to over 80% of its tokens being sold in the presale, reflecting strong investor confidence. The Strategic Advantage of Mpeppe for Solana Investors For Solana (SOL) investors, adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios offers a strategic advantage in the current market environment. With Solana (SOL) facing increased competition and potential market volatility, diversifying into Mpeppe provides a way to hedge against these risks while also positioning themselves for significant upside potential. Long-term wealth creation in the crypto space often involves identifying high-potential projects early and holding onto them as they grow. Mpeppe fits this mold perfectly. Its low entry price, combined with its strong growth prospects, makes it an ideal candidate for long-term investment. By getting in on Mpeppe now, Solana (SOL) investors can take advantage of its early-stage growth while also benefiting from the potential for massive returns. The Future of Mpeppe and Solana: A Winning Combination As we look to the future, the combination of Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) in a single portfolio represents a powerful strategy for achieving both short-term gains and long-term wealth. Solana (SOL) continues to be a leader in the layer-1 blockchain space, with the potential for significant price appreciation in the coming years. However, the addition of Mpeppe offers an extra layer of security and opportunity, particularly as the memecoin market continues to grow and evolve. In the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency, timing is everything. Solana (SOL) investors who recognize the potential of Mpeppe and act now could be positioning themselves for a windfall of profits as the token gains traction. With its strong community backing, innovative approach, and low entry price, Mpeppe is quickly becoming the secret weapon for those looking to maximize their returns and secure long-term wealth in the crypto market. Conclusion: Don‚Äôt Miss the Mpeppe Gold Rush The cryptocurrency market is full of opportunities, but few are as promising as Mpeppe (MPEPE). For Solana (SOL) investors looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the next big wave of growth, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a compelling option. With its explosive growth potential, strong community support, and strategic advantages, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to become a major player in the crypto world.

32972344,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638632,1724954067,The Mpeppe Gold Rush Solana Whale Pledges $4m Into MPEPE and ICP,"The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to dramatic shifts and high-stakes investments, but the latest move by a prominent Solana (SOL) whale has set the community abuzz. This seasoned investor has recently pledged a staggering $4 million into Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Internet Computer (ICP), marking one of the most significant bets on the future of these rising tokens. This move signals a broader trend among crypto whales who are increasingly looking beyond established giants like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum, seeking the next big opportunity in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. The Rise of Mpeppe: A New Player in the Meme Coin Market Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly emerging as a major contender in the memecoin arena, a sector known for its rapid growth and intense community support. Unlike other memecoins that rely solely on hype, Mpeppe is building a robust ecosystem aimed at long-term sustainability and user engagement. Its presale has been nothing short of spectacular, with over 80% of tokens already sold at a price of $0.001777, reflecting strong investor confidence and growing community interest. Mpeppe‚Äôs appeal lies in its unique blend of viral marketing, community-driven development, and strategic partnerships that aim to extend its reach far beyond the memecoin niche. As more investors take note, the token‚Äôs value is poised for explosive growth, making it an attractive option for those looking to diversify their portfolios with high-potential assets. Why the Solana Whale Is Betting Big on Mpeppe and ICP The decision by the Solana (SOL) whale to invest heavily in Mpeppe and Internet Computer (ICP) is not just a gamble on short-term gains; it reflects a strategic move to capture value in two of the most promising sectors in the crypto world today: memecoins and decentralized web infrastructure. Solana (SOL) has long been a favorite among crypto whales due to its fast transaction speeds, low fees, and growing ecosystem. However, as the market matures, even the most loyal Solana (SOL) investors are exploring new opportunities. Mpeppe, with its potential for 100x returns, offers a tantalizing prospect for those willing to venture into the memecoin space. On the other hand, Internet Computer (ICP) represents a different kind of investment. As a project focused on decentralizing the internet, Internet Computer (ICP) has been steadily gaining traction among institutional investors and tech-savvy individuals alike. Its recent partnerships and technological advancements have positioned it as a leader in the race to build a decentralized web, making it a natural complement to more speculative investments like Mpeppe. The Strategic Importance of Diversification For the Solana (SOL) whale, diversifying into Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Internet Computer (ICP) is a way to hedge against market volatility while positioning themselves for substantial upside potential. By spreading their investment across these three tokens‚ÄîSolana (SOL), Mpeppe, and Internet Computer (ICP)‚Äîthey‚Äôre not only protecting their capital but also maximizing their chances of capturing the next big wave in the crypto market. Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its low entry price and strong community backing, offers a high-risk, high-reward opportunity that could pay off handsomely if the token‚Äôs growth trajectory continues. Meanwhile, Internet Computer (ICP) provides a more stable, long-term investment in a technology that could redefine how we interact with the internet. The Future of Mpeppe, Solana, and ICP As we look ahead to the future, the combination of Mpeppe (MPEPE), Solana (SOL), and Internet Computer (ICP) in a single portfolio represents a balanced approach to crypto investing. Solana (SOL) continues to dominate in the layer-1 blockchain space, with predictions of a tenfold increase in its value over the next year. Internet Computer (ICP) is poised to lead the charge in decentralized web technologies, offering a solid foundation for long-term growth. Mpeppe (MPEPE), though newer to the scene, has the potential to be the dark horse that outperforms both Solana (SOL) and Internet Computer (ICP). With its explosive growth and strong community, it could very well be the next memecoin to make headlines, offering early investors the kind of returns that are becoming increasingly rare in the crypto market. Conclusion: A Bold Move in a High-Stakes Game The $4 million pledge by the Solana (SOL) whale into Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Internet Computer (ICP) is more than just a large investment; it‚Äôs a statement about the future of cryptocurrency. In a market where timing and foresight are everything, this move underscores the growing belief that Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Internet Computer (ICP) are not just fleeting trends but significant players in the next phase of crypto evolution. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain traction and Internet Computer (ICP) solidifies its role in the decentralized web, the future looks bright for those who have the vision and courage to invest early. For the Solana (SOL) whale, this could be the beginning of a new era of wealth generation in the crypto space, and for everyday investors, it serves as a powerful reminder of the opportunities that lie ahead in this ever-changing market.

Recently, one of the most talked-about tokens has been Mpeppe (MPEPE), a rising star in the memecoin universe that has captured the attention of both retail and institutional investors. What‚Äôs fascinating is that Mpeppe is not only attracting new crypto enthusiasts but also seasoned investors from established tokens like Solana (SOL) and Internet Computer (ICP). With Mpeppe‚Äôs potential for a 100x return, Solana (SOL) and Internet Computer (ICP) holders are diving into this opportunity with fervor. The Growing Buzz Around Solana and ICP Solana (SOL) has been making headlines for quite some time now, thanks to its robust blockchain infrastructure and growing adoption.

42417299,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTY57N,1724951927,Beating the Bots: In Defense of Human Traders,"On March 18, some $9.5 billion was traded on decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, across all chains tracked by DeFi data site DefiLlama. March was a month of heavy trading, to be sure, but volume on the 18th was about the same as the day before.  But take a look at the data from a different angle and March 18 stands out: It was the highest volume trading day for crypto bots in the last six months, according to data tracked by the user @whale_hunter and published on the Dune Analytics platform.  According to the Dune dashboard, over $700 million was traded on March 18 by bots with names like BonkBot, Maestro and Banana Gun. They operate across a plethora of chains, from Ethereum to Solana. And that day, they collectively racked up $5.5 million in fees for themselves.  Scan the Dune dashboard further and you‚Äôll see that trading bots have raked in over $220 million in fees collectively since they were tracked. They‚Äôre responsible for over $33 billion in lifetime volume on DEXs. They‚Äôre crypto‚Äôs ‚Äúnew cash cows,‚Äù as one research report from Delphi Digital put it.  What are the odds that you, a retail crypto trader, can beat the bots at their game? Bots are great at acting on past information (and quickly), but the real gigabrain traders are foretelling what‚Äôs next ‚Äì often in ways that algorithms can‚Äôt. In short, acting slowly can give you the upper hand.  That‚Äôs where a new type of platform, predicated on human expertise and provable reputation, really shines.  But first we must understand the limits of our crypto-trading bot friends. How can it be that humans could ever hope to defeat an army of tireless robots at the toughest game of all: beating the market? The answer lies in the way bots and humans reason.  Can bots really beat the market?  As Ali Yahya, a former AI researcher and current crypto investor at Andreessen Horowitz lays out, AI today relies on a type of laborious inductive reasoning to arrive at its conclusions. This means it consumes a vast amount of data to draw connections between them. When prompted, it can fit the ‚Äúquilt‚Äù of connections it has created to respond and generate an answer.  By contrast, humans can carry out a creative inquiry: craft hypotheses and conduct experiments to prove them wrong, then take the results and write a general theory. This theory is deductive: It can be applied to a variety of scenarios and be logically correct.  This difference in modes of reasoning exposes AI most brutally when it comes to long-tail subjects. In these cases, the data required by AI models to stitch their ‚Äúquilts‚Äù of connections are scarce. This means the quilts become threadbare and the models spit out poor responses when prompted. AI models today ‚Äúmirror (rather than explain, as humans do) the chaos and complexity of the phenomena they observe,‚Äù Yahya writes.  So AI bots can‚Äôt create a theory that predicts future situations; they can‚Äôt explain a particular scenario. They can only mirror, from millions of past examples, what has already come before. They can act extremely fast; you can‚Äôt beat them on speed. But, often, the slower, analytical approach is what wins.  Nevertheless, trading bots are growing in popularity. A radically human-centered approach could counter them. We want human traders to post their predictions in an on-chain, verifiable, way so that others can cross-check them and, if they wish, follow those traders‚Äô future predictions. Verifiability is key: We all know tales of dubious influencers leading their followers astray for personal gain.  That‚Äôs where SanR comes in: Traders can use the platform to indicate whether they believe a particular token is moving up at a certain price, or down. These predictions are recorded as NFTs on-chain, meaning they can‚Äôt be falsified at a later date should the prediction prove inaccurate. As traders make their calls, the number of accurate and inaccurate predictions pile up, revealing the proportion of each. Other users can then review this data in assessing each traders‚Äô predictive powers, while remaining confident the data hasn‚Äôt been messed with.  If you are a trader with great predictive powers, why would you share this with others? To be sure, many will choose not to. Others, perhaps starting out on their journey, or for the love of market research, will. SanR is a permissionless platform that allows anyone to publish their signals in a transparent way.  In that way, we‚Äôve created a network of humans sharing market signals with one another, allowing them to publish these signals permissionlessly, while aligning incentives. Best of all, all these forecasts are on-chain and can be checked at any time, and cannot be altered after the fact.  On-chain reputation plus accountability: That‚Äôs how human-powered tools give traders their best shot at beating the bots ‚Äî¬†and the market.

32971583,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638624,1724951891,Solana Investors Are Losing Their Minds Over Mpeppe‚Äôs 100x Potential,"In September crypto investors are on the lookout for the next big opportunity, and it seems they might have found it in Mpeppe (MPEPE). This emerging memecoin is generating buzz across the crypto community, particularly among Solana (SOL) investors, who are starting to believe that Mpeppe might just be the next big thing. With Solana‚Äôs already impressive performance and a top analyst predicting a potential 10x surge for SOL, the excitement around Mpeppe‚Äôs 100x potential is reaching fever pitch. Solana‚Äôs Meteoric Rise and What It Means for Mpeppe Solana (SOL) has had a phenomenal year, with its price soaring by more than 600% in the past 12 months. Even with recent market corrections, SOL continues to show resilience, trading at around $147 despite being down from its July peak of $191. This performance has led to bullish predictions, with analysts like Raoul Pal, a former Goldman Sachs executive, forecasting a potential 10x increase for Solana (SOL), which could push its price up to $1,470. This optimism around Solana (SOL) is also spilling over to other promising tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE). As investors look to diversify their portfolios and maximize returns, many are now eyeing Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a high-reward opportunity that complements their holdings in SOL. With a presale price of just $0.001777 and over 80% of tokens already sold, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is being hailed as a potential moonshot that could deliver 100x returns, making it an attractive option for both Solana (SOL) enthusiasts and broader crypto investors. The Case for Mpeppe: Why Solana Investors Are All In Mpeppe‚Äôs (MPEPE) rise in popularity isn‚Äôt just due to its low entry price; it‚Äôs also because of its strategic positioning in the market. As a memecoin, Mpeppe (MPEPE) taps into the viral nature of the crypto space, where community-driven projects can experience explosive growth. But Mpeppe (MPEPE) isn‚Äôt just another memecoin; it‚Äôs designed with a strong foundation that includes robust community support and a well-planned marketing campaign, both of which are crucial for its long-term success. For Solana (SOL) investors, who have already seen significant gains from their SOL holdings, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a new frontier to explore. The potential for massive returns is undeniable, and the timing couldn‚Äôt be better. With Solana (SOL) itself predicted to experience a 10x surge, those who invest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) now could benefit from both the growth of SOL and the explosive potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE). Could Mpeppe Be the Next Ethereum-Like Success? The crypto world has seen its fair share of moonshots, with Ethereum (ETH) being one of the most notable examples. Early investors in ETH saw their investments grow exponentially, and many are now wondering if Mpeppe (MPEPE) could follow a similar trajectory. While Ethereum remains a dominant force in the blockchain space, Solana (SOL)‚Äôs rapid rise as an alternative has shown that there‚Äôs room for multiple winners in the crypto market. Mpeppe (MPEPE)‚Äôs potential to achieve Ethereum-like success hinges on its ability to attract a dedicated community and deliver on its promises. With the presale nearly complete and the token set to hit the open market soon, early investors could see significant returns. For Solana (SOL) investors, who are already bullish on their own blockchain‚Äôs future, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a chance to diversify and potentially capitalize on a new success story. Solana and Mpeppe: A Perfect Pair for Maximum Returns The synergy between Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is hard to ignore. Solana (SOL)‚Äôs blockchain has proven to be fast, efficient, and increasingly popular, especially with the recent adoption of PayPal‚Äôs PYUSD stablecoin, which has seen 64% of its volume processed on the Solana (SOL) network. This growing adoption of Solana (SOL)-based assets is a strong indicator of the blockchain‚Äôs potential to continue its upward trajectory. By adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios, Solana (SOL) investors can position themselves to benefit from two high-growth opportunities simultaneously. As Solana (SOL) aims for a 10x increase, Mpeppe (MPEPE)‚Äôs 100x potential offers an additional layer of upside, making it a compelling option for those looking to maximize their gains in the crypto market. The Future of Mpeppe: Ready to Take the Crypto World by Storm As the excitement around Mpeppe (MPEPE) builds, the token is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about new entries in the crypto space. With strong community support, a well-executed presale, and the backing of savvy investors, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to make a significant impact once it hits the open market. For Solana (SOL) investors, who have already enjoyed substantial gains from their SOL holdings, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a new opportunity to ride the next big wave in cryptocurrency. Whether Mpeppe (MPEPE) will reach the same heights as Ethereum or Solana (SOL) remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the potential for massive returns is there, and those who get in early could be handsomely rewarded. In the world of crypto, timing is everything. As Solana (SOL) continues to capture the attention of investors and analysts alike, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as the next big thing to watch. For those looking to capitalize on the next major moonshot, Mpeppe (MPEPE) might just be the ticket to extraordinary gains.

32971363,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638621,1724951280,Mpeppe: The Next ETH Moonshot? Solana Investors Are Going Wild!,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, new tokens emerge regularly, each with the potential to disrupt the market and deliver staggering returns. Among the most talked-about tokens recently is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a memecoin that is quickly becoming the talk of the town, especially among investors who are traditionally more aligned with Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). With the rapid adoption of Mpeppe and its promising trajectory, Solana investors, in particular, are going wild over its potential. The Solana vs. Ethereum Debate: Why Mpeppe Is Gaining Traction Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have long been competitors in the Layer-1 blockchain space. Each has its unique strengths: Ethereum often leads in Total Value Locked (TVL), reflecting its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi), while Solana (SOL) has recently excelled in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, thanks to its faster transaction speeds and lower fees. However, as the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, investors are constantly on the lookout for the next big opportunity. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new memecoin that has gained significant attention, is emerging as a potential moonshot that could rival even the best-performing assets on both Ethereum and Solana (SOL). Why Solana Investors Are Eyeing Mpeppe The recent surge in Solana (SOL)‚Äôs use, particularly with PayPal‚Äôs PYUSD stablecoin, highlights the blockchain‚Äôs growing prominence in the crypto ecosystem. Solana (SOL) now processes 64% of PYUSD‚Äôs market capitalization, with 81% of that volume actively used in DeFi protocols. This has positioned Solana (SOL) as a strong alternative to Ethereum, especially for investors looking to capitalize on the growing DeFi space. Yet, despite Solana (SOL)‚Äôs success, many of its investors are looking to diversify their portfolios further. Enter Mpeppe (MPEPE), a token that has rapidly gained traction due to its viral appeal and the promise of massive returns. Priced at just $0.001777 during its presale, Mpeppe offers a low-cost entry point with the potential for exponential growth, making it an attractive option for both seasoned and new investors. The Mpeppe Hype: A Perfect Storm for Solana Investors The excitement around Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just based on hype; it‚Äôs built on a foundation of strategic marketing, community support, and timing. The token‚Äôs presale has already seen over 80% of its tokens sold, a testament to the strong demand and investor confidence. This momentum has caught the attention of Solana (SOL) investors, who see Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a high-reward opportunity that complements their existing holdings in SOL. Moreover, Mpeppe (MPEPE)‚Äôs potential to follow in the footsteps of other successful memecoins, like those on the Ethereum network, adds to its appeal. For Solana (SOL) investors, who have already benefited from the blockchain‚Äôs recent successes, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a chance to participate in a new, high-growth opportunity without abandoning their core investments. Could Mpeppe Be the Next ETH Moonshot? The question on everyone‚Äôs mind is whether Mpeppe (MPEPE) can achieve the same level of success as some of the major tokens on the Ethereum network. Ethereum has long been the go-to blockchain for launching innovative projects, particularly those involving DeFi and Layer-2 solutions like Pepe Unchained (PEPU). However, the rise of Solana (SOL) and its ability to attract significant projects and stablecoins like PYUSD shows that the crypto space is becoming more diverse, with multiple blockchains sharing the spotlight. Mpeppe (MPEPE)‚Äôs success could very well hinge on its ability to appeal to both Ethereum and Solana (SOL) investors. The token‚Äôs low entry price, combined with its potential for massive returns, makes it an enticing option for those looking to catch the next big wave in cryptocurrency. For Solana (SOL) investors, who have seen their blockchain rise to prominence, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique opportunity to get in early on what could be the next ETH-like success story. The Future of Mpeppe: A New Era for Solana and Beyond As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain momentum, its future looks increasingly promising. With the presale nearing completion and the token set to hit the open market, early investors could see significant returns. For Solana (SOL) investors, who have already enjoyed the benefits of their blockchain‚Äôs growth, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a new frontier to explore. In the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency, staying ahead of the curve is crucial. Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a fresh opportunity for Solana (SOL) investors to diversify their holdings and potentially reap substantial rewards. As the token prepares to make its mark, those who invest now could be well-positioned to benefit from what could be the next big moonshot in the crypto space. Whether Mpeppe (MPEPE) will become the next ETH-like phenomenon remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Solana (SOL) investors are already going wild over its potential, and the excitement is only just beginning.

32971253,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638617,1724951039,Mpeppe Rapid Growth Build Traction From Internet Computer Holders,"The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to rapid shifts in sentiment, and as 2024 progresses, a new player has emerged that is capturing the attention of investors across the board. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a memecoin that has been quietly gaining momentum, is now seeing an influx of interest from a surprising source: Internet Computer (ICP) holders. These savvy investors are recognizing the potential in Mpeppe‚Äôs rapid growth and are flocking to the token as it builds traction in the market. The Rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Story of Viral Growth Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a memecoin that has taken the crypto community by storm. Launched with little fanfare, the token has quickly become a hot topic in crypto circles, thanks to its clever marketing, viral appeal, and the promise of significant returns. Priced at just $0.001777 during its presale, Mpeppe offers a low entry point that is attracting a wide range of investors, including those who traditionally focus on more established tokens like Internet Computer (ICP). The allure of Mpeppe lies in its potential for rapid growth. The token‚Äôs presale has already seen over 80% of its tokens sold, a clear indicator of strong investor interest. As more people become aware of Mpeppe and its potential, the token‚Äôs value is expected to rise sharply, making it an attractive option for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolios. Why Internet Computer (ICP) Holders Are Eyeing Mpeppe (MPEPE) Internet Computer (ICP) has long been a favorite among long-term investors, thanks to its innovative approach to decentralizing the web and its strong foundational technology. However, even the most dedicated Internet Computer (ICP) holders are always on the lookout for new opportunities to maximize their returns. This is where Mpeppe (MPEPE) comes in. The rapid growth of Mpeppe (MPEPE) has not gone unnoticed by the Internet Computer (ICP) community. With its low entry price and high potential for returns, Mpeppe represents a unique opportunity to capitalize on the current memecoin craze. For Internet Computer (ICP) holders, who are used to the steady, long-term growth associated with their primary investment, Mpeppe offers a chance to engage in the more volatile, but potentially more rewarding, world of memecoins. Building Traction: Mpeppe‚Äôs Appeal to the ICP Community The growing interest in Mpeppe among Internet Computer (ICP) holders is not just about the potential for quick gains. There are several factors that make Mpeppe particularly appealing to this group of investors: Diversification: For any investor, diversification is key to managing risk and maximizing returns. By adding Mpeppe to their portfolios, Internet Computer (ICP) holders can diversify their holdings into the memecoin market, which operates on a different set of dynamics than more established cryptocurrencies like Internet Computer (ICP). Community-Driven Growth: Both Internet Computer (ICP) and Mpeppe have strong, engaged communities that drive their success. Internet Computer (ICP) holders are drawn to Mpeppe not just for its financial potential, but also because of its vibrant community that is reminiscent of the early days of Internet Computer (ICP). High Reward Potential: While ICP offers a stable, long-term investment, Mpeppe provides the possibility of explosive short-term gains. This dual approach allows ICP holders to balance their portfolios with both steady growth and high-risk, high-reward opportunities. The Future of Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Its Growing Appeal As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain traction, its future looks increasingly bright. The token is on the verge of completing its presale, and once it hits the open market, its value is expected to rise significantly. For ICP holders, this presents a prime opportunity to get in early and reap the rewards of Mpeppe‚Äôs rapid growth. Moreover, the increasing interest from ICP holders is likely to further boost Mpeppe‚Äôs profile, attracting even more investors to the token. As the ICP community continues to engage with Mpeppe, the token‚Äôs community-driven growth model will only become stronger, setting the stage for sustained success. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for Savvy Investors The rapid growth of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a clear sign that this memecoin is more than just a flash in the pan. With its low entry price, strong community support, and high potential for returns, Mpeppe is quickly becoming a favorite among savvy investors, including those who hold Internet Computer (ICP). For ICP holders, the decision to invest in Mpeppe is a strategic move that allows them to diversify their portfolios and participate in the exciting world of memecoins. As Mpeppe continues to build traction and its value rises, those who got in early are likely to see significant returns on their investment. In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, Mpeppe represents a unique opportunity to capitalize on the next big thing.

Recently, the crypto community has been abuzz with news that several Internet Computer (ICP) whales have made substantial purchases of Mpeppe (MPEPE), a promising new memecoin, in anticipation of a staggering 340x return on investment (ROI). The Rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE): A New Contender in the Memecoin Arena Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly become a focal point for crypto enthusiasts, particularly those involved in the memecoin market. Priced at just $0.001777 during its presale, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an enticing entry point for investors looking to maximize their gains. Its low price, coupled with a strong marketing campaign and viral community support, has set the stage for what many believe could be an explosive rise in value. While Internet Computer (ICP) continues to be a stronghold for long-term investors, the allure of quick and substantial gains has led many of these whales to diversify into Mpeppe (MPEPE). The potential for a 340x ROI is not just a wild fantasy; it‚Äôs a calculated risk based on the memecoin‚Äôs trajectory and the broader market dynamics. The Whale Strategy: Why ICP Investors Are Eyeing Mpeppe (MPEPE) Internet Computer (ICP) whales are no strangers to high-stakes investments. Their significant holdings in Internet Computer (ICP) have given them a unique position in the market, one that allows them to take calculated risks on emerging tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE). The decision to invest heavily in Mpeppe (MPEPE) is driven by several key factors: Market Diversification: For any seasoned investor, diversification is crucial. While Internet Computer (ICP) offers stability and long-term growth potential, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a high-reward opportunity. By adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios, Internet Computer (ICP) whales are hedging their bets and positioning themselves for potentially massive returns. Memecoin Momentum: The memecoin market is known for its unpredictability and potential for rapid gains. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has already shown signs of following in the footsteps of other successful memecoins like Pepecoin (PEPE). The viral marketing and strong community backing have created a buzz that is hard to ignore. Strategic Timing: Timing is everything in the crypto world. With Mpeppe (MPEPE) still in its presale phase, the entry price is as low as it will ever be. Internet Computer (ICP) whales recognize the value of getting in early, before the token hits the open market and its price begins to climb. A Tale of Two Tokens: ICP and Mpeppe (MPEPE) The story of Internet Computer (ICP) is one of innovation and long-term vision. As a Layer 1 blockchain, Internet Computer (ICP) aims to decentralize the web, offering scalable, secure solutions that have attracted a loyal following of investors. These investors, or ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù have seen the potential of Internet Computer (ICP) to revolutionize the internet as we know it. However, even the most visionary investors understand the need for balance. While Internet Computer (ICP) offers a steady path to growth, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides the excitement of the unknown. It‚Äôs the kind of investment that could turn a modest sum into a fortune virtually overnight. For ICP whales, the decision to buy into Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not about abandoning their core holdings but about embracing the potential for exponential gains in a different sector of the market. The Potential for 340x ROI: A Calculated Gamble The prospect of a 340x ROI is what has driven many ICP whales to take the plunge into Mpeppe (MPEPE). This kind of return is not unheard of in the memecoin market, where tokens can skyrocket in value seemingly out of nowhere. The key is to get in early, before the masses catch on and the price begins its upward trajectory. For the ICP whales, this investment is a calculated gamble. They have the resources to take such risks, and the potential rewards are simply too enticing to pass up. If Mpeppe (MPEPE) does indeed achieve a 340x ROI, these whales stand to make a fortune, further solidifying their positions as some of the most influential players in the crypto world. The Future of Mpeppe (MPEPE) and ICP As Mpeppe (MPEPE) approaches the end of its presale and prepares to enter the broader market, all eyes are on its performance. Will it live up to the hype and deliver the promised returns? For the ICP whales who have invested heavily, the stakes are high, but so are the potential rewards. Meanwhile, Internet Computer (ICP) continues to build on its solid foundation, offering long-term growth opportunities for its investors. The story of these two tokens ,one rooted in the future of the decentralized web, the other in the fast-paced world of memecoins‚Äîhighlights the diverse strategies at play in the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion: A Bold Move with Potentially Huge Payoffs The decision by Internet Computer (ICP) whales to invest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a testament to their savvy and willingness to take calculated risks. While ICP provides the stability and long-term vision needed in any portfolio, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers the thrill of potentially life-changing gains. As we move further into 2024, it will be fascinating to see how these investments play out and whether Mpeppe (MPEPE) can indeed deliver on its promise of a 340x ROI. For now, it seems that the whales have made their move, and the crypto world is watching closely.

32971171,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638531,1724950807,XRP Gains Ground: 20% Of Institutional Investors Embrace The Crypto,"Institutional investors are gradually giving more attention to XRP. The digital asset is marking its place next to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Related Reading: XRP Poised For Over 5,000% ‚ÄòExplosive Charge‚Äô, Analyst Says According to a recent survey by EY-Parthenon, more than 20% of the world‚Äôs institutional decision-makers have XRP in their basket. It isn‚Äôt a small sample choice; 277 key players comprised of COOs, CEOs, portfolio managers, etc., took part in this survey, with participation spanning the US, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Canada, and Latin America. A well-known XRP community member known by his Twitter handle WrathofKahneman, aka WOK, shared findings from the survey on X. Judging from comments, it would appear that the altcoin‚Äôs growing institutional acceptance is a major talking point. Though Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the darlings of 98% and 78% of those surveyed respectively, the fact that 20% of portfolios have the altcoin is quite a big deal. Solana, on the other hand, is making noise too, with 24% of the respondents claiming to have invested in SOL. Institutional Interest Beyond Bitcoin And Ethereum What is interesting to note in the survey is that places are not just sticking to the tried and true Bitcoin and Ethereum but are also open to the use of altcoins such as XRP and Solana. In any case, the point is diversification, with 57% of the respondents attesting to investments beyond the top two cryptos. The growing traction in the crypto asset on the part of institutional investors corresponds with the global expansion drive of Ripple. According to recent reports by Tokenicer, it has highlighted that XRP has been deployed on all seven continents ‚Äì a versatility which is strong due to partnerships forged by Ripple across the globe. From the Bank of Colombia testing its CBDC on Ripple‚Äôs platform to other strategic moves across South America and Europe, XRP stands very far from being confined to a single geographical region. Legal Wins Boost Market Sentiment Meanwhile, as the XRP case against the Securities and Exchange Commission has been a dark cloud hovering over the coin‚Äôs market performance, recent developments are indeed the light at the end of the tunnel. Recently, World of Charts analyzed the outlook for XRP following a lawsuit filed by the SEC that had weighed heavily on the price. This resolution marked a huge win for this long battle and will allow XRP to pick up steam once more and probably soar in price. Related Reading: Crypto Crash: $320 Million Wiped Out As Bitcoin And Ethereum Nosedive From a technical viewpoint, XRP is positioned in a multi-year symmetric triangle, a pattern that usually precedes a big breakout. This technical setup, combined with positive sentiment from the legal resolution, positions XRP as likely to see bullish action in the next few months, according to many analysts. There‚Äôs speculation it could break out and reach $3, or even higher, if market conditions align. Buying Pressure Builds Increasing buying pressure by investors also confirms the case for XRP. In effect, more institutions and retail buyers believe in the potential of XRP, thereby raising demand accordingly. With prices higher as supplies get tighter, that could make XRP the crypto asset to watch in the short term.

More information might finally be coming soon.  Latest News: Trump's New Crypto Business to Offer Access to 'High-Yield' Investments, Website Says  Former U.S. President Donald Trump said he'll have more to say this afternoon about his mysterious upcoming cryptocurrency project, World Liberty Financial.  Trump posted a video clip to X on Thursday morning, tagging World Liberty Financial saying: ""This afternoon I‚Äôm laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet. They want to choke you, they want to choke you out of business. We‚Äôre not going to let that happen.""  Though ostensibly a teaser for World Liberty Financial, Trump‚Äôs comments are not new ‚Äì the video recycles audio from Trump‚Äôs 50-minute speech at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville in July. Trump‚Äôs speech in Nashville was about his plan to make the U.S. a crypto hub if reelected president.  What's known about Trump's crypto and DeFi plans  The details about the project have so far been scant.  The project appears to be spearheaded by Trump‚Äôs second son, Eric Trump, an executive vice president of his family‚Äôs holding company, the Trump Organization. On Aug. 6, Eric Trump posted on X that he had ""truly fallen in love with Crypto/DeFi"" and urged his followers to ""stay tuned for a big announcement,"" tagging both his father and older brother Don Jr. in the post.  The following week, Eric Trump gave an interview to the New York Post where he further teased the project, hinting that it could be a way for people to access loans without going through the traditional banking system, but declined to share any specific details.  ""Essentially over half this country right now cannot be banked,"" Eric Trump told the newspaper. ""Meaning they will be rejected for most loans from most institutions. But with this technology they could have the ability to almost instantaneously be approved or denied from a lender based on math, not policy.""  On Aug. 23, Trump announced the name of the project ‚Äì then called ""The DeFiant Ones"" ‚Äì on Truth Social, writing: ""For too long, the average American has been squeezed by the big banks and financial elites. It‚Äôs time we take a stand ‚Äì together."" The post also contained a link to a Telegram group for the project, which currently has nearly 54,000 members.  Five days later, Eric Trump took to X to announce that the project had been renamed World Liberty Financial. ""Excited to announce the launch of @WorldLibertyFi!,"" Eric Trump wrote. ""A new era in finance is here.""  In the absence of details about the project from the Trump family, scammers and chancers have capitalized on crypto users‚Äô enthusiasm ‚Äì and confusion ‚Äì about the forthcoming project, offering coins purportedly connected to Trump and World Liberty Financial.  ""If it‚Äôs not from us, it‚Äôs not real,"" Trump‚Äôs team warned the project‚Äôs followers in the official Telegram channel.

The crypto, though, hasn't yet enjoyed the ""widespread adoption"" in the country as hoped for, he added.  Under Bukele, El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender and started purchasing it as a treasury asset in 2021.  Nayib Bukele, El Salvador's pro-Bitcoin {{BTC}} president, said his plan to make the country a hotbed for the largest and oldest cryptocurrency has been ""net positive"" but adoption has fallen short of his expectations.

""I feel that it could have worked better, and there is still time to make some improvements, but it hasn‚Äôt resulted in anything negative.""  El Salvador, however, has benefitted in multiple ways from positioning itself as a Bitcoin-friendly country while the risks that institutions such as the IMF warned of have yet to materialize, according to Bukele.  ""It gave us branding, it brought us investments, it brought us tourism,"" he said. ""I do believe that the positive outcomes outweigh the negative, and the issues that have been highlighted are relatively minor.""  El Salvador, under Bukele's leadership, became the first nation state to start purchasing bitcoin as a treasury asset in September 2021. It also adopted the cryptocurrency as a legal tender that year. The country also laid out plans for issuing bonds backed with BTC mined there and introduced a citizenship through investment scheme for foreigners who donate to the government.  Bukele also reminded that El Salvador was a ""first mover,"" and today Wall Street companies are offering numerous Bitcoin-related investment products and the crypto playing a sizable role in this year's U.S. presidential election  El Salvador country has accumulated a sizable bitcoin stack through a combination of direct purchases and its citizenship program.

However, as 2024 unfolds, these seasoned Internet Computer (ICP) investors are looking to diversify their portfolios, and one token has caught their eye Mpeppe (MPEPE), a rising memecoin with the potential to rival Pepecoin (PEPE). The Rise of AI Tokens: A Boon for ICP Recently, AI tokens have been making headlines for their impressive performance, outshining the broader crypto market. Over the last seven days, AI-related tokens have added a staggering $8 billion to their market capitalization. This surge has been led by top performers like NEAR, FET, and RENDER, with Internet Computer (ICP) also benefiting from this wave of investor enthusiasm. Internet Computer (ICP) has seen its market cap swell to approximately $3.8 billion, reflecting a 9% increase in value over the same period. This growth is part of a broader trend where AI tokens are capturing the attention of investors looking for the next big opportunity in the crypto space. For Internet Computer (ICP) holders, this surge in AI tokens represents both a validation of their investment strategy and a signal to explore new avenues for growth. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) is Attracting ICP Investors While Internet Computer (ICP) continues to be a strong performer, long-term investors understand the importance of diversification. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new memecoin, has emerged as a compelling option for those looking to capitalize on the booming meme token market. Priced at just $0.001777 during its presale, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an attractive entry point with the potential for significant returns. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has gained traction thanks to its unique approach, combining the viral appeal of memecoins with the rapidly growing crypto gambling sector. This strategic focus has drawn the attention of investors who see parallels between Mpeppe (MPEPE) and other successful tokens like Pepecoin (PEPE). As over 80% of the Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokens have already been sold, it‚Äôs clear that the market is responding positively to this new player. The Appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE) for ICP Investors Diversification with High Growth Potential: For Internet Computer (ICP) investors, adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios represents a chance to diversify into a high-growth sector. The low entry price and the potential for massive returns make Mpeppe (MPEPE) an appealing option for those looking to balance their investment strategies. Leveraging the Memecoin Craze: Like Pepecoin (PEPE), Mpeppe (MPEPE) is riding the wave of the memecoin craze. However, Mpeppe (MPEPE) adds its own twist by targeting the lucrative crypto gambling market, which could drive further demand and price appreciation. Community and Viral Potential: Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly built a strong community, essential for the success of any memecoin. This community-driven approach, combined with effective viral marketing, positions Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a token with the potential to achieve significant growth in a short period. The Future of Mpeppe (MPEPE) and ICP As 2024 progresses, both Internet Computer (ICP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are positioned to benefit from the evolving dynamics of the crypto market. Internet Computer (ICP)‚Äôs strong foundation in the AI sector provides a solid base for long-term growth, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers the excitement of a new opportunity with the potential for explosive returns. For long-term Internet Computer (ICP) investors, the decision to add Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their holdings is not just about chasing the next big thing; it‚Äôs about strategically positioning themselves to capitalize on emerging trends. With the memecoin market showing no signs of slowing down, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) poised to make a significant impact, this could be the perfect time for investors to diversify and maximize their potential returns. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for 2024 In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, staying ahead of the curve is crucial. For Internet Computer (ICP) investors, adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios represents a strategic move that could pay off handsomely in the months to come. With its unique positioning in the memecoin and crypto gambling markets, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers the potential for substantial gains, making it an attractive option for those looking to diversify and enhance their investment strategies.

32970288,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638603,1724947951,Pepecoin vs Mpeppe How Will Make More Millionaires in 2024,"Only a few tokens have captured the imagination of investors quite like Pepecoin (PEPE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). As we move closer to 2024, the big question on everyone‚Äôs mind is: which of these meme-inspired tokens will mint more millionaires? While Pepecoin (PEPE) has already made a name for itself, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a strong contender, offering unique advantages that could potentially lead to explosive growth in the coming year. The Rise of Pepecoin (PEPE) Pepecoin (PEPE) burst onto the scene as a memecoin with a quirky frog mascot, quickly gaining popularity among crypto enthusiasts. Its viral appeal and strong community support have driven its value to new heights, turning early adopters into millionaires almost overnight. Recently, Pepecoin (PEPE) has been on a bullish trend, with its price surging by 14.5% in just a week. The token‚Äôs daily trading volume has surpassed $500 million, reflecting strong investor interest and indicating that Pepecoin (PEPE) is far from fading into obscurity. Analysts are keeping a close eye on Pepecoin (PEPE) as it approaches a critical resistance level around $0.00000830. Should it break through this barrier, the token could rally to the next resistance zone at $0.00000980, offering an 18% potential upside. With such prospects, Pepecoin (PEPE) continues to attract a loyal following, making it a strong contender for creating new millionaires in 2024. Enter Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Challenger While Pepecoin (PEPE) continues to thrive, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is making waves in the cryptocurrency community, particularly among those looking for the next big thing. Priced at just $0.001777 during its presale, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a low entry point with the potential for massive returns. Already, over 80% of the tokens have been sold, showcasing strong investor confidence in this up-and-coming memecoin. Mpeppe (MPEPE) differentiates itself from Pepecoin (PEPE) by focusing on the booming crypto gambling market. This strategic move positions Mpeppe (MPEPE) to tap into a lucrative sector that is still in its infancy, offering early investors the chance to reap substantial rewards. With a strong community backing and innovative use cases, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly emerging as a serious contender in the memecoin arena. What Sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) Apart? Targeting the Crypto Gambling Market: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is strategically aligned with the rapidly growing crypto gambling sector, which offers a unique angle for growth. This focus on a niche market could help Mpeppe (MPEPE) capture a dedicated audience, driving demand and potentially leading to significant price increases. Community and Viral Potential: Much like Pepecoin (PEPE), Mpeppe (MPEPE) has a strong and passionate community that is crucial for its success. The viral nature of memecoins often plays a significant role in their price movements, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is leveraging this to build momentum and attract a broader audience. Early Entry Advantage: With Mpeppe (MPEPE) still in its presale phase, early investors have the opportunity to buy in at a low price before it hits the open market. As the presale progresses and more tokens are sold, the price is expected to rise, making early entry a key strategy for maximizing returns. Pepecoin (PEPE) vs Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Verdict Both Pepecoin (PEPE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer compelling reasons to invest, but which one will create more millionaires in 2024? Pepecoin (PEPE) has the advantage of being a well-established token with a proven track record of success. Its recent price surge and strong trading volume suggest that it still has room to grow, potentially rewarding those who hold on for the long term. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents the excitement of discovering a new opportunity before it goes mainstream. With its focus on the crypto gambling market and low entry price, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a high-reward proposition that could pay off handsomely for those willing to take the plunge. Conclusion: A Balanced Approach For investors looking to capitalize on the potential of both tokens, a balanced approach might be the best strategy. By holding both Pepecoin (PEPE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), investors can diversify their portfolios, hedge against risks, and position themselves to benefit from the unique strengths of each token. As we move into 2024, the competition between Pepecoin (PEPE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is likely to intensify. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned investor or new to the crypto space, keeping an eye on both of these tokens could be the key to unlocking substantial wealth in the coming year.

32969320,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638539,1724945418,Bitcoin Forecast: Expert Reveals 4 Reasons To Be Bullish On Q4,"In his latest market analysis titled ‚ÄúSugar High‚Äù, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes lists four reasons to be bullish on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market in the final quarter of 2024. Hayes opens his analysis with a metaphorical comparison of his skiing diet to the fiscal approaches of major central banks. He likens quick energy snacks to short-term monetary policy adjustments, particularly the interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank. These cuts, he argues, are like ‚Äúsugar highs‚Äù‚Äîthey boost asset prices temporarily but must be balanced with more sustainable financial policies, akin to ‚Äúreal food‚Äù in his analogy. This pivotal monetary policy shift after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell‚Äôs announcement at the Jackson Hole symposium, triggered a positive reaction in the market, aligning with Hayes‚Äôs prediction. He suggests that the anticipation of lower rates makes assets priced in fiat currencies with fixed supplies, such as Bitcoin, more attractive, hence boosting their value. He explains, ‚ÄúInvestors believe that if money is cheaper, assets priced in fiat dollars of fixed supply should rise. I agree.‚Äù However, Hayes cautions about the potential risks of a yen carry trade unwind, which could disrupt the markets. He explains that the anticipated future rate cuts by the Fed, BOE, and ECB could reduce the interest rate differential between these currencies and the yen, posing a risk of destabilizing financial markets. Hayes argues that unless real economic measures, akin to his ‚Äúreal food‚Äù during ski touring, are taken by central banks‚Äîspecifically expanding their balance sheets and engaging in quantitative easing‚Äîthere could be negative repercussions for the market. ‚ÄúIf the dollar-yen smashes through 140 on the downside in short order, I don‚Äôt believe they will hesitate to provide the ‚Äúreal food‚Äù that the filthy fiat financial markets require to exist,‚Äù he adds. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plummets To $59,000, On-Chain Data Reveals Why To further solidify his argument, Hayes references the US economy‚Äôs resilience. He notes that the US has only experienced two quarters of negative real GDP growth since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which he argues is not indicative of an economy that requires further rate cuts. ‚ÄúEven the most recent estimation of 3Q2024 real GDP is a solid +2.0%. Again, this is not an economy suffering from overly restrictive interest rates,‚Äù Hayes argues. 4 Reasons To Be Bullish On Bitcoin In Q4 This assertion challenges the Fed‚Äôs current trajectory towards lowering rates, suggesting that it might be more politically motivated rather than based on economic necessity. In light of this, Hayes presents four key reasons to bullish on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market in Q4. 1. Global Central Bank Policies: Hayes highlights the current trend of major central banks, which are cutting rates to stimulate their economies despite ongoing inflation and growth. ‚ÄúCentral banks globally, now led by the Fed, are reducing the price of money. The Fed is cutting rates while inflation is above their target, and the US economy continues to grow. The BOE and ECB will likely continue cutting rates at their upcoming meetings,‚Äù Hayes writes. Related Reading: Buying Bitcoin Now Is Like Getting It Below $10,000 In 2019: Experts 2. Increased Dollar Liquidity: The US Treasury, under Secretary Janet Yellen, is set to inject significant liquidity into the financial markets through the issuance of $271 billion in Treasury bills and an additional $30 billion in buybacks. This increase in dollar liquidity, totaling around $301 billion by year-end, is expected to keep financial markets buoyant and could lead to increased flows into Bitcoin and crypto as investors seek higher returns. 3. Strategic Treasury General Account Usage: Approximately $740 billion remains in the US Treasury General Account (TGA), which Hayes suggests will be strategically deployed to support market conditions favorable for the current administration. This substantial financial maneuvering capability could further enhance market liquidity, indirectly benefiting assets like Bitcoin that thrive in environments of high liquidity. 4. Bank Of Japan‚Äôs Cautious Approach To Interest Rates: The BOJ‚Äôs recent apprehensive stance towards raising interest rates, particularly after observing the impact of a minor rate hike on July 31, 2024, signals a cautious approach that will consider market reactions closely. This cautiousness, intended to avoid destabilizing markets, suggests a global environment where central banks might prioritize market stability over tightening, which again bodes well for Bitcoin and crypto. Hayes concludes that the combination of these factors creates a fertile ground for Bitcoin‚Äôs growth. As central banks globally lean towards policies that increase liquidity and reduce the attractiveness of holding fiat currencies, Bitcoin stands out as a finite supply asset that could potentially skyrocket in value. ‚ÄúSome fear that the Fed cutting rates is a leading indicator of a US and, by extension, developed market recession. That might be true, but they will ramp up the money printer and dramatically increase the money supply. That leads to inflation, which could be bad for certain types of businesses. But for assets in finite supply like Bitcoin, it will provide a trip at lightspeed 2 Da Moon! Hayes states. At press time, BTC traded at $60,094.

The deal is expected to increase Alchemy's headcount by about 25%.  Alchemy disclosed the acquisition on Thursday without revealing the purchase price. However, company officials told CoinDesk this was its biggest acquisition to date, bringing on 41 developers and engineers from the Bware team and increasing Alchemy's headcount to 190.  Bware Labs was founded in 2021 in Romania by five engineers. The company's stated goal was to provide affordable blockchain tooling and infrastructure solutions to web3 developers.  With the purchase, Alchemy will expand its operational base into Europe. Currently, its operations are mainly focused on the U.S., as it has its two headquarters in San Francisco and New York City.  Alchemy co-founder and CTO Joseph Lau told CoinDesk in an interview that the Bware team will integrate with Alchemy‚Äôs existing product teams, where they‚Äôll be contributing to Alchemy‚Äôs core infrastructure products including their node API platform.  ‚ÄúThe EU represents about a quarter of the Web3 market, and so it's just even more important for us to be there today, as we look to expand,‚Äù said Lau. ‚ÄúSo both from a serving-developers-better, and from a hiring standpoint, we really wanted to be in the EU.‚Äù  Read more: Blockchain Developer Platform Alchemy Releases AI-Powered Tools for Web3 Builders",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/08/29/blockchain-developer-alchemy-buys-bware-pushing-into-europe-adding-25-to-staff,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f88a5afa86477da08a4831318b4a62b42f34d3c2-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Then, Jason Leibowitz from Hashnote provides insights about market trends and the hunt for yield in Ask an Expert.  - Sarah Morton  You‚Äôre reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk‚Äôs weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Weekly Crypto Market Review  Recently, the digital asset market saw little movement after cryptocurrencies were not discussed during the highly anticipated X space between Elon Musk and Donald Trump. BTC hovered around $58,750, down just over 1% from the previous day. The broader crypto market, represented by the CoinDesk 20 Index, experienced a similar decline. Despite high expectations from the crypto community and a 65% chance bet on Polymarket for ""crypto"" being mentioned, the topic never came up during the two-hour interview, which drew over 1 million listeners.  US Inflation Rate & Federal Reserve Outlook  The next U.S. FOMC meeting will take place on Sept. 18. As a result of the recent market rout, the market now expects the Federal Reserve to begin rate cuts in September, with about 100 basis points (bps) cut by the end of December. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) year-over-year is expected to stay at 3.0% for July's data release, while Core CPI year-over-year is expected to decrease from 3.3% to 3.2%. As usual, the Fed will not rush to make decisions but rather monitor economic data first. They are now stuck between increasing credits and fighting inflation.  ETF Developments  On Monday, U.S.-listed spot Ether ETFs saw a net inflow of $4.93 million, with Fidelity's FETH leading at $3.98 million. Franklin Templeton's EZET and Bitwise's ETHW posted inflows of $1 million and $2.86 million, respectively, while VanEck's ETHV saw an outflow of $2.92 million. Bitcoin ETFs, collectively, had a daily inflow of $27.87 million, despite Grayscale's GBTC and Bitwise's BITB recording outflows of $11.7 million and $17 million, respectively. Grayscale's two Ether funds showed no flows.  BTC & ETH Option Flows  The week saw successful hedge/bear plays targeting $54-58K puts, with funds adding exposure to Oct-Mar $60-65K calls on the rebound. While short-term put-skew shows caution, long-term call bulls remain strong, with the market awaiting Producer Price Index (PPI) and CPI data.  Although near-term volatility and skew have been retraced, long-term calls and spreads were not adjusted; instead, they increased. There's confidence in buying upside, funded by selling <$45K Puts, but short-term protection around $48-50K persists.  Skew dynamics show elevated short-term put-skew, while longer-term calls trade at a premium.  ETH saw strong volumes with protection around $2-2.3K Strikes and later added $2.3-2.7K Calls, impacting IVs and raising the ETH-BTC Dvol spread.  Recent FOMC and JPow AMA were overshadowed by NFP, raising recession concerns. Upcoming PPI and CPI data will provide more insight into market trends. BTC DVOL is at 57.45%, while ETH DVOL is at 72.92%.  ETH Technical Analysis  On August 12, 2024, Ethereum (ETH) was valued at $2,683, fluctuating within a range of $2,523 to $2,720. Despite significant market activity, technical indicators suggest that ETH is facing difficulties breaking through resistance levels, indicating a potential bearish trend. Short-term recovery is noted, but maintaining levels above $2,700 remains a challenge, with a possible drop towards $2,600 if selling pressure increases. While some indicators show buying opportunities, the overall outlook is bearish, with caution advised for traders. Ethereum's future movement will depend on breaking above key levels like $2,800.  Weekly Crypto Asset Flows  Digital asset investment products experienced inflows totalling $176 million as investors viewed recent price declines as buying opportunities.  Ethereum saw the most significant benefit from the market correction, drawing $155 million in inflows, bringing its year-to-date total to $862 million.  ETH Staking Statistics  ETH staking new validator activation takes 10 hours and 13 minutes, while the ETH exit queue is very short at 1 minute, showing that there is more interest in staking now.  The total amount of ETH staked is currently 28.06%, and the recent staking reward is 3.21% p.a. Compared with the Decentralized liquid staking solution, Lido‚Äôs market share still dominates at 71.56%.  In summary, the crypto market may still be sideways and volatile for a while as the market is speculating on the Fed‚Äôs September rate cut. Unfortunately, there is not much good news that could stimulate and send the market up to 70K soon. It is not surprising to see that yields generated from staking or other products are more welcomed than putting in ETFs.  - Xinghua Luo, Managing Director, Pioneer Asset Management Limited  The views, thoughts, and opinions expressed in this column belong solely to the author.  Ask an Expert  Q. How has the dispersion in crypto returns evolved over the past year, and what are the key factors contributing to this trend?  Over the past year, crypto returns have exhibited notable dispersion, with assets like Bitcoin and Solana outperforming many others. This divergence marks a departure from previous cycles where gains were more evenly spread across the market. Key factors contributing to this trend include macroeconomic conditions such as tightening liquidity and rising interest rates, which have generally suppressed performance in riskier and less established assets. Additionally, the recent Bitcoin halving has played a role by reducing new supply, historically leading to prolonged periods of bullish activity where Bitcoin outperforms the other majors.  A significant factor in this dispersion is the shift away from lending as a primary yield-generating strategy. The previous crypto cycle saw the creation of a credit bubble fueled by lending, which ultimately burst, leaving investors wary of allowing their assets to leave custodianship. In response to this shift in investor sentiment, some of the most forward-looking funds have introduced safer yield-generating solutions by utilizing the derivatives market. Products like Harbor allow investors to earn returns on idle assets like Bitcoin through options strategies such as covered call spreads, all while keeping assets secure within a custodian's control. This approach offers a creative and secure alternative to the lending practices that defined the previous cycle.  Q.In what ways have stablecoins and a hunt for yield influenced the current state of crypto market dispersion?  Stablecoins and the hunt for yield have significantly influenced the current state of crypto market dispersion. Stablecoins provide a stable medium of exchange and store of value within the volatile crypto ecosystem, facilitating seamless trading and access to DeFi services. However, while stablecoins offer stability, they generally do not provide any yield to investors.  This is where tokenized money market funds have started to play a crucial role. These assets offer investors a way to earn stable, risk-mitigated returns by directly passing on the yields from short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. Tokenized money market funds bring the benefits of blockchain technology‚Äîsuch as transaction speed, transparency, and composability‚Äîwhile minimizing the protocol, custody, regulatory, and credit risks often associated with other token projects. The advent of these assets adds a new layer of stability and yield potential to the crypto ecosystem, contributing to the diversification of investor portfolios.  Despite the benefits of stablecoins and tokenized money markets, there remains a growing portion of the crypto economy in search of further yield, particularly among investors holding idle assets like Bitcoin. While lending was once a popular strategy, the bankruptcies and frauds in 2022 highlighted the substantial risks involved in lending platforms. As the market recovers from these setbacks, new companies are beginning to emerge, offering more robust, transparent, and secure lending platforms. These platforms claim to have learned from past mistakes, leading to better risk management practices and contributing to the overall dispersion seen across various crypto assets.  Q.Considering current trends and factors, what should investors be aware of regarding the future trajectory of crypto market dispersion?  Investors should recognize that crypto market dispersion will likely persist in the foreseeable future due to ongoing and emerging factors influencing the space. The upcoming U.S. presidential election introduces potential regulatory changes that could impact market sentiment and asset performance, depending on the policies of the elected administration. Additionally, technological advancements and differing levels of adoption across various blockchain ecosystems will continue to drive disparate outcomes among crypto assets.  Diversifying investment strategies through well-regulated and professionally managed funds can help mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities across the spectrum of crypto assets. Emphasizing due diligence and a thorough understanding of individual asset fundamentals will be essential in navigating the evolving and segmented landscape of the crypto market.  - Jason Leibowitz, head of private wealth, Hashnote  Keep Reading  Franklin Templeton has extended it‚Äôs tokenized money market fund to the Avalanche blockchain.

42390522,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2UDz,1724941432,Art Is Not a Security,"Apparently, the Securities and Exchange Commission thinks the NFT market is a securities market. On Tuesday, August 27, NFT marketplace OpenSea received a Wells notice from the SEC. A Wells notice is a formal notification that the SEC staff intends to file a civil enforcement action against the recipient. While a Wells notice is a confidential communication, the SEC seems to think that some or all of the NFTs on OpenSea are unregistered securities and selling them violates the securities laws.  Brian Frye is a law professor at the University of Kentucky and conceptual artist who works with NFTs.  The SEC is wrong. No, it‚Äôs worse. The SEC is nuts. The NFT market is identical to the art market. Or rather, the NFT market is an art market. If the SEC can regulate the NFT market, then it can also regulate the art market. But the art market existed long before the SEC was created in 1934, and the SEC has never regulated the art market or even contemplated regulating the art market. It can‚Äôt and it shouldn‚Äôt. If Congress had wanted to give the SEC authority to regulate the art market, it would have said so. And, if it made sense for the SEC to regulate the art market, it would have done so a long time ago.  While this Wells notice is ridiculous, it‚Äôs also no surprise, at least to me. I predicted it five years ago, when I published a law review article styled as a work of conceptual art titled ‚ÄúSEC No-Action Letter Request‚Äù in 2019. The conceptual artwork consisted of filing a no-action letter request with the SEC, proposing to sell an editioned conceptual artwork titled ‚ÄúSEC No-Action Letter Request‚Äù and observing that it looked an awful lot like an unregistered security, according to the SEC‚Äôs definition. But the SEC ignored me, because it considered my observation ‚Äúfanciful.‚Äù  And others like Bloomberg‚Äôs Matt Levine, agreed with them, claiming that my artwork wasn‚Äôt a security because no one would actually buy it. Okay, I guess. But, when I was a securities lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell, I sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt have advised a client that they could avoid SEC regulation by offering to sell a security that no one would actually buy.  Along came the NFT market, and it turned out that people would buy my artwork after all. I refashioned ‚ÄúSEC No-Action Letter Request‚Äù as an NFT, and it sold out in less than an hour. I was delighted, not only by the money, but also by the proof of concept. I guess people would buy it after all. But the SEC still didn‚Äôt care and kept ignoring my no-action letter requests.  Read more: OpenSea Gets 'Wells Notice' From SEC, Which Calls NFTs Sold on Platform 'Securities'  What gives? At first, I thought the SEC didn‚Äôt care about NFTs. But I was wrong. They didn‚Äôt want to sue me, they wanted to sue someone with an incentive to settle. That‚Äôs why they sued Impact Theory and Stoner Cats. Both were conventional NFT projects that had run their course. The defendants had no reason to fight, because they had nothing to gain.  That‚Äôs why we sued the SEC. I don‚Äôt care about money. I care about the principle. I create and write about NFTs because I find them interesting. And part of what I find interesting about NFTs is that they expose the incoherence of the SEC‚Äôs understanding of what it‚Äôs authorized to regulate.  Anyway, Jonathan Mann and I filed a declaratory judgment action against the SEC in federal court, asking it to explain how and why it‚Äôs authorized to regulate the sale of NFTs. After all, we‚Äôre just artists selling our artworks to people who like them. It shouldn‚Äôt matter that we‚Äôre selling our artworks on the blockchain, rather than a conventional catalogue raisonne.  And that‚Äôs the point. When artists sell artworks in the conventional art market, what they‚Äôre selling is objects that represent ownership of an entry on the artist‚Äôs catalog. From an economic perspective, a conventional artwork is just a dirty piece of cloth or lumpy rock that represents ownership of a fractional interest in an artist‚Äôs commercial goodwill. An NFT is the same thing, in digital form.  When the SEC regulates the NFT market, it‚Äôs really regulating the art market. Can it make a superficially coherent argument that NFTs are securities it can regulate? Sure. But I don‚Äôt think the courts are going to buy it.  Regardless, if the SEC wants to go after OpenSea, it can‚Äôt avoid our lawsuit. And I don‚Äôt think it has any answers to our questions that aren‚Äôt embarrassing.

MATIC, Polygon‚Äôs native token, has suffered greatly from the recent bearish market sentiment that spread within the past couple of days. Related Reading: FET: On-Chain Development Fuels 44% Surge In Just A Week According to CoinGecko, MATIC has fallen 18% since last week, marking a big slash on the token‚Äôs upward trajectory. Despite MATIC‚Äôs poor performance in the last couple of days, Polygon continues to innovate, cementing its position within the crypto community. Polygon Releases New Details About Network Upgrade According to Polygon‚Äôs official X post, the MATIC upgrade to POL will yield benefits, including new features that improve the network‚Äôs usability and security. One of the most notable addition to the network is the inclusion of new roles for validators, improving upon the network‚Äôs incentives for the latter while also creating motivation for broader on-chain participation. POL goes beyond the traditional and introduces the concept of a hyperproductive token ‚Äî enhancing utility, scalability, and productivity across the Polygon network. What this means as the network transitions from MATIC to POL, for an aggregated blockchain network üßµüëá pic.twitter.com/TzrFtuA4ra ‚Äî Polygon | Aggregated (@0xPolygon) August 26, 2024 The upgrade will enable validators to secure multiple chains, which enhances the overall security and efficiency of the network. It also improves Polygon on the scalability aspect as once it attracts more validators on the platform, more chains can be secured in one go fostering a new era of improved user experience. POL will also be used to fund on-chain projects with a controlled emission schedule. ‚ÄúWith a controlled emission schedule and a portion of rewards directed to the Community Treasury, POL supports ongoing development, funding grants, and initiatives to ensure long-term growth,‚Äù said Polygon within their thread. MATIC holders can expect the upgrade to be seamless and automatic on the Polygon Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network. However, holders of Ethereum and centralized exchanges (CEXs) may take some action before the upgrade is applied to their wallet as some dApps may integrate the upgrade smart contract with their user interface. Related Reading: Crypto Crash: $320 Million Wiped Out As Bitcoin And Ethereum Nosedive Downward Trajectory May Halt On $0.43, Stabilizing Within The Coming Weeks As of writing, MATIC‚Äôs downward trajectory forced the token to touch $0.43 in the short term as the bears continue to wreak havoc in the market. This price floor might be broken through by the bears within the coming days, which brings a host of new problems for investors in the long term. However, with the market‚Äôs bearishness grinding to a halt, the relative strength index remaining stable might enable the bulls to regain lost ground in the coming days. That is if the market sentiment flips to bullish. If bullishness does return to the market, MATIC may see a renewed September rally as the market environment improves. Its high correlation with Bitcoin will also bode well for the token as any swing made by the prime cryptocurrency will enable MATIC bulls to eye $0.55 in the medium term.

32965922,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638502,1724934622,Dogwifhat On The Edge: Can WIF Hold Above $1.47 As Bears Close In?,"Dogwifhat (WIF) is at a critical juncture as the price hovers around the $1.47 support level, with bearish pressure mounting. After a period of relative stability, the cryptocurrency is now under threat from renewed selling momentum that could push it below this key threshold. A break below this critical level could open the floodgates for further downside, while a successful defense might signal a potential reversal. With Dogwifhat‚Äôs price teetering at the critical $1.47 support level, this article aims to analyze its precarious position and evaluate whether the intensifying bearish pressure could push the price lower. We‚Äôll delve into key technical indicators, market sentiment, and potential scenarios to give traders and investors a clear outlook on WIF‚Äôs next possible moves. Is A Breakdown Below $1.47 Inevitable For Dogwifhat? WIF‚Äôs price is currently consolidating just below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart. As long as Dogwifhat stays under this key indicator, bearish pressure could intensify, driving the price below the $1.47 support mark. Additionally, on the 4-hour chart, both the signal line and the SMA of the Composite Trend Oscillator have fallen below the zero mark, now approaching the oversold zone. This current positioning indicates that bearish pressure remains strong in the market, suggesting the potential for further price declines. On the daily chart, Dogwifhat has shown significant negative movement below the 100-day SMA by printing three bearish momentum candlesticks. This bearish surge reflects strong selling pressure and negative market sentiment, increasing the likelihood of WIF breaking below the $1.47 mark. Finally, the 1-day composite trend oscillator reveals persistent bearish pressure for WIF. The signal line is attempting a move below the SMA of the indicator, with both components trending below the zero line. This positioning underscores the ongoing downward momentum and suggests that negative sentiment could continue to dominate. Scenarios For Bulls And Bears At $1.47 Exploring WIF‚Äôs future outlook reveals that if the price reaches $1,47 and breaks below, the price will continue to move downward toward the $0.7 support mark. When the price reaches this level and breaks below, it may move lower to test the $0.2 support mark and probably move on to test other lower support marks. However, if Dogwifhat manages to hold at the $1.47 support level and the bulls initiate a rebound, the price could start to climb toward the $2.10 resistance mark. Should it break through this resistance, WIF may continue to ascend, with the next significant target being the $3.50 resistance level and potentially higher levels beyond. In the past 24 hours, Dogwifhat was trading near $1.61, attracting a 1.77% increase. The cryptocurrency‚Äôs market capitalization has climbed above $1.6 billion, while trading volume exceeded $399 million. During this period, the market cap saw a 1.76% boost, whereas trading volume declined by 9.38%.

Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,930 ‚àí0.2%  Bitcoin (BTC): $60,150 +0.2%  Ether (ETC): $2,558 +1.2%  S&P 500: 5,592.18 ‚àí0.6%  Gold: $2,555 +2.2%  Nikkei 225: 38,362.53 ‚àí0.02%  Top Stories  Bitcoin rose above $60,000 during the late European morning following a sharp decline earlier this week. The largest cryptocurrency was trading around $60,350, nearly 6% below its $64,000 starting level Monday. The downward trend may now have halted ahead of another short-term rally. The broader digital asset market has fallen around 0.45% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Indices data. Ether rose about 1.35% to around $2,550 after spot ether ETFs registered inflows of $5.9 million on Wednesday, ending a nine-day losing streak.  The TON blockchain suffered a second outage in 24 hours late Wednesday on account of activity linked to the DOGS token. The outage lasted just over four hours and follows a six-hour incident on Tuesday, also attributed to DOGS minting. TON's native token fell below $5.20 when the network crashed, losses it subsequently reversed after service was resumed. The TON token was priced at around $5.60 during the European morning, an increase of over 1.75% in the last 24 hours. The token is still trading below its level prior to the arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov.While Telegram and TON are legally separate entities, the two are closely affiliated as one relies on the other.  Durov's release on bail on Wednesday cost Polymarket bettors $270,000 in lost winnings. Durov was formally indicted in France and released after he posted a 5 million-euro ($5.6 million) bond while agreeing to report to police twice weekly and to stay in the country. The quick release contrasted with bettors' overall sentiment that an extended detention was more probable. At one point, the chance of an August release was pegged in the mid-30%s while a release before October was priced 75%-90%. In total, bettors missed out on $270,000 by betting ""No"" on an August release, and ""No"" for before October. Likely, bettors had their money on French authorities keeping Durov for as long as possible.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the correlation between peaking earnings-per-share (EPS) growth rates and 10% corrections which amplify market volatility.  Nasdaq-listed Nvidia's shares fell over 7% after hours on Wednesday even after the chipmaker's earnings beat estimates.  Bitcoin has exhibited a strong positive correlation to NVDA since 2022, so the chipmaker's stock is one crypto traders watch closely.

Scams are driving the majority in 2024's multibillion-dollar crypto-crime sector, per the report published Thursday. Though large by dollar value, this sum is still relatively small: less than 1% of on-chain value is linked to illicit activity, said Chainalysis' research lead Eric Jardines.  Other illicit uses are gaining traction, including using crypto in child exploitation material and other cybercrime tools. Scams remain the largest part of the bucket.  Given the havoc that so-called pig butchering scams can wreak on individuals, anyone with a crypto wallet should take care. Pig butchering scammers ""fatten"" up their targets with romantic overtures and other tactics that build trust before hitting them with a fake investment opportunity, stealing their funds.  Stealing the money is, however, only half the battle. Scammers need to exit their positions and centralized crypto exchanges, the most obvious off-ramp, have gotten better over the years at stomping some illicit activity.  Enter Huione Guarantee. It's an online marketplace managed by a Cambodian conglomerate where anyone can post offers to buy, or sell, just about anything ‚Äì including crypto. The marketplace only acts as a facilitator; other than moving money around, it doesn't regulate who is getting the money, or where they got it from.  Since 2021 the platform has processed $49 billion in crypto transactions, according to Chainalysis. The company said it believes at least some of that activity is linked to crypto-criminals running pig butchering and money laundering operations.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/08/29/pig-butchering-scams-remain-dangerous-threat-in-crypto-markets-chainalysis-report-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/14ada4d35c12abfc9942c070bca2c2667a41d0c3-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Recent changes in holdings haven't mitigated these risks; new additions like TeraWulf, Core Scientific, and Cipher Mining still struggle with negative cash flows. Incumbent miners continue to burn cash, while Coinbase and Galaxy remain the strongest players with positive free cash flows. As this is a very volatile issue, I've re-rated to hold to discourage short positions. Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ) is a fund that I've covered before . In that piece, I went over the Top Ten holdings, which accounted for a majority of the fund, and noted that they primarily burn cash and regularly need to issue more shares to remain operational, presenting long-term risks of loss through dilution or insolvency. While there have been changes, I continue to worry about those risks, but I have re-rated to a Hold, preferring to discourage a short position for long-term investors. Since Last Coverage Since I last published on March 5th, total return has been very volatile and currently sits just over 16%. BITQ 6M Total Returns (Seeking Alpha) Many things have influenced this, such as the halving of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in April and the possibility of a favorable Presidency, after Trump named crypto-investor J.D. Vance as his running mate and announced plans to form an American BTC reserve. At the same time, some of the holdings have continued to struggle, amid disappointing financial results. CleanSpark ( CLSK ), Canaan ( CAN ), and Hive ( HIVE ) have fallen out of the Top Ten. Seeking Alpha They were replaced by TeraWulf ( WULF ), Core Scientific ( CORZ ), and Cipher Mining ( CIFR ). Overall, the weight of the Top Ten fell from two-thirds to 60.7% of the funds, but they still represent a solid majority of the fund, and I believe looking at them gives enough insight into BITQ as a whole. Observing the New Stocks TeraWulf, a miner, does not have many years of operating results, but so far, its annual cash flows have been negative. WULF Cash Flow Statement (2023 Form 10K) While operating cash flows turned positive in 2023 have continued to grow in 2024, capex still exceeds what they can generate from operations. WULF Cash Flow Statement (Q2 2024 Form 10Q) Core Scientific, another BTC miner, boasts a year 2023 with free cash flow! CORZ Cash Flow Statement (2023 Form 10K) One would almost be impressed, had the company not been under Debtor-in-Possession status during that time. As their 2023 Form 10K (pg. 87) noted: As of December 31, 2023, we were debtors-in-possession under the Bankruptcy Code. As such, we were authorized to continue to operate as an ongoing business but may not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court. Their latest Form 10Q (pg. 13) notes that new terms were reached and the restrictions of the bankruptcy were lifted. CORZ Cash Flow Statement (Q2 2024 Form 10Q) Unsurprisingly, their free cash flow has returned to being net-negative. CIFR Cash Flow Statement (2023 Form 10K) Cipher, also a miner, has failed to generate even positive cash flows from operations each year. CIFR Cash Flow Statement (Q2 2024 Form 10Q) This trend of outflow has continued for 2024 as well. Overall, their problem is the same that I outlined in my initial coverage. Miners (as a business) struggle to generate more cash than they spend on capex. This capex is primarily spent on the purchase and acquisition of miners (the machines) to solve blocks and earn new units of BTC. All of them primarily buy and utilize machines produced by Bitmain, which are specifically made to be useful for mining BTC and likely have no other application. Another element that I mentioned last time is that this cost is unlikely to stabilize or go down, as hash rate needed to solve a block and earn BTC increases as more participants attempt to mine BTC. This creates an arms race of ever-increasing costs, and to date BTC has not traded at a high enough market price for miners to be reliably cash-generative. In other words, the rotation of some of Top Ten's constituents did nothing to change this risk in my view. Incumbents Since my last coverage, the miners have continued to burn cash, and this includes Riot ( RIOT ), Bitfarms ( BITF ), Northern Data AG (NDTAF) and Marathon ( MARA ). I actually covered Bitfarms again recently, and I find them to be one of the better miners operationally. I also praised their budding designs to expand into HPC/AI, leveraging their expertise in developing and maintaining electrical infrastructure. Screenshot (ABetterBitfarms.com) Their main problem has been their conflict with Riot, which has resulted in leadership changes as they try to take over BITF. Riot launched ABetterBitfarms.com as part of their activist campaign. A complete takeover by what I consider to be a lesser operator could ruin the one most redeeming miner of the bunch, and so I could only rate that one a Hold, too. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), as a trader of BTC and provider of BTC-related software, services continues to generate positive cash flows. MSTR Cash Flow Statement (Q2 2024 Form 10Q) It should be noted, however, that it is down somewhat from 2023's levels, suggesting it could be exposed to cyclical trends or competitive pressures. MSTR Cash Flow Statement (Q2 2024 Form 10Q) This benefit is also voided by the dilution resulting from its stock-based compensation, which dwarfs the value of its free cash flow, which was a historical I had noted previously. Coinbase ( COIN ) and Galaxy ( GLXY:CA ) continued to be the strongest players of the Top Ten, with positive free cash flows and levels of stock-based compensation that don't overwhelm it either. I covered Coinbase last month, discussing its Q1 results and rating it a Hold. Its core segment as a crypto trading platform shows signs of cyclicality, while hinting long-term growth potential with its Stablecoin service. Conclusion I continue to view BITQ as an example of an ETF that exists because it's easy to make any idea into an ETF, such as one for crypto companies. Based on the Bitwise Crypto Innovators 30 Index, it lacks active or mindful selection, and this has led to much of the AUM being invested in companies that burn cash. The bankruptcy of Core Scientific, now one of its Top Ten holdings, shows what a precarious situation this is for the miners especially. Should folks want to invest in equities exposed to cryptocurrencies (as opposed to buying crypto itself), BITQ is better as a short list to narrow down until two or three contenders stand out. In this case, I would think COIN, GLXY:CA, and MSTR are the best places to start because they at least generate cash. I've re-rated to hold largely because I want to discourage anyone taking a short position on these long-term weaknesses in the portfolio, especially since the underlying asset, BTC, is very sensitive to news events. Overall, however, the portfolio companies still bear too much risk to make this ETF a Buy.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4717835-bitq-still-unlikely-to-produce-solid-returns?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32964623.jpeg

The paper also said technology to address some of the risks, particularly privacy, is being developed. naming zero-knowledge proofs as a potential solution.  Banks that transact on permissionless blockchains face multiple risks, including money laundering and terrorism financing, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision concluded in a new paper.  The committee is part of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the primary global standard setter for prudential banks.  Other risks include operations and security, governance, legal, settlement finality and compliance, the paper said.  ""Certain risks stem from the blockchains‚Äô reliance on unknown third parties, which makes it difficult for banks to conduct due diligence and oversight. These risks require new risk management strategies and safeguards.

Banks are also exposed to political uncertainty as a new legislation could ""change validator behaviour,"" making the ""blockchains themselves operationally unstable.""

Its price dropped over 13% from Monday‚Äôs high, bringing LINK to a critical support level of around $11.20. Traders and investors are closely monitoring this crucial area. Related Reading: LINK Surges 11% As Key Data Reveals Day Traders Are Locking Gains The importance of this level is further emphasized by on-chain data from Santiment, which shows that demand for LINK is cooling off. This adds to the uncertainty surrounding the asset‚Äôs near-term price action. The next few days will be pivotal as Chainlink hovers around this crucial support. The outcome here could determine whether LINK stabilizes and regains its footing or faces further downside. This level will likely set the stage for LINK‚Äôs next major move, making it a critical point of interest for market participants. Chainlink Demand Cooling Off? Uncertainty and fear are currently driving market sentiment for Chainlink (LINK). Its price is testing a crucial support level amid declining demand. On-chain data from Santiment highlights a weakening market. A negative price-daily active address (DAA) divergence confirms the recent decline in LINK‚Äôs demand. This metric compares an asset‚Äôs price movements with the changes in its number of daily active addresses, providing insight into whether network activity backs the price action. Currently, LINK‚Äôs price DAA divergence stands at -61.2%. This indicates a significant disconnect between its price and the number of active users on the network. Such a substantial negative divergence suggests a weakening market and hints at the possibility of further price declines. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Eyes $3,000: Data Suggests Imminent Breakout The lack of network activity to support the current price level raises concerns. Traders and investors are worried that LINK might struggle to maintain its position above the crucial $11.20 support. If demand does not pick up soon, LINK could face additional downward pressure, possibly leading to a deeper correction in the coming days. LINK Price Action Shows Indecision Chainlink is trading at $11.22 after losing its 4-hour 200 moving average (MA). This critical indicator now acts as low-timeframe resistance. This development has placed LINK in a precarious position, with the immediate support level being the $10.91 low marked on Tuesday. Holding above this level is essential for maintaining the possibility of a continued uptrend. If LINK sustains this support, the price could enter a period of sideways consolidation, setting the stage for a potential push toward local highs in the coming week. However, LINK may face further downside pressure if it fails to hold the $10.91 support. Key levels to monitor include $9.50 and the $8.12 local low. A breakdown below these levels could signal a deeper correction, potentially leading to a bearish trend.

42390516,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2ToL,1724928488,Cash-to-Crypto Industry Dominated by ATMs Is a Law-Enforcement Concern: TRM Labs,"Law enforcement authorities globally have concerns about the use of crypto ATMs in scams, a report by blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs found.  Last year, over $30 million went to known scam addresses through cash-to-crypto services.  Since 2019, the cash-to-crypto industry ‚Äì which is dominated by crypto ATMs ‚Äì has processed at least $160 million in illicit transactions, according to a study by blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs.  The report, released Wednesday, highlights why law enforcement authorities worldwide have concerns about the growing use of crypto ATMs, which take fiat currency and send crypto to the desired digital wallet. In 2023 alone, 79% of all illicit cash-to-crypto tranfers, over $30 million, went to known scam addresses through cash-to-crypto services.  Crypto ATMs were in the spotlight again earlier this month when Germany's financial regulator, BaFin, seized 13 in a raid, confiscating cash amounting to almost 250,000 euros ($280,000). The report said such crackdowns are part of a ""broader trend,"" citing the 2023 examples of the U.K. shutting down 26 bitcoin ATMs and U.S. authorities seizing 18 in Texas and more than 50 Bitcoin of America ATMs in Ohio. The U.K. charged a shopkeeper with operating an illegal crypto ATM for the first time, the BBC reported on Wednesday.  ""While illicit actors look to cryptocurrencies to move funds faster cross-border, crypto ATMs face additional money laundering vulnerabilities due to the use of cash and lack of face-to-face communication or account open controls,"" the report said.  Of the 15,000 complaints last year involving $1 billion in losses due to digital asset scams affecting people aged 60 and above, as many 2,000, some 13%, involved bitcoin ATMs.  The report said regulatory actions in the U.S. have forced over 1,000 machines offline since May, though the country remains home to more than 31,000 of them, the most in the world.  Australia, where the number of machines has grown 17-fold over two years, may have become the third-largest market for crypto ATMs. Authorities in the country have identified the kiosks as a money laundering vulnerability, the report said.

Canaccord noted that the launch of spot ETFs in the U.S. has led to broader institutional adoption of digital assets.  Institutional allocations to crypto are expected to increase, the broker said.  The digital assets industry has bounced back from the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022 and has returned to growth in the past year, broker Canaccord said in a research report on Wednesday.  FTX, the crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy following a CoinDesk exclusive highlighting the weakness of the company's balance sheet. The company's collapse was a major contributor to the crypto winter and bear market for digital assets.  ""In the last year, we believe the broader digital assets industry has transitioned from a post FTX consolidation/recovery phase back to one focused on growth and business model/total addressable market (TAM) expansion,"" analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote.  The launch of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. earlier this year was a positive catalyst for the crypto market.  With the approval of both bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} spot ETFs, ""we have also seen broader institutional adoption of digital assets and expect portfolio allocations here to continue to increase,"" the authors wrote.  Spot ether ETFs started trading in the U.S. on July 23, about six months after the bitcoin funds.  The broker praised Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR) for its ""continued evolution into a Bitcoin development company,"" and noted that the shares have risen around 325% in the past year, outperforming most asset classes including BTC, which has gained about 148%.  Wall Street giant Citi (C) noted that the crypto market has struggled since the launch of spot ether ETFs in the U.S., in a report last week.

42390518,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2TjD,1724925600,Can Prediction Market Boom Continue After Election? This Crypto Team Has a Plan,"SALT LAKE CITY ‚Äî As Kyle DiPeppe sees it, crypto's prediction market fad has a looming expiration date: Nov. 5, 2024.  Election day will bring judgment for hundreds of millions of dollars in bets placed on the U.S. presidential contest and the myriad other political races that have turned sector leader Polymarket into a massive success. Once these races are decided, so will their prediction markets, leaving their bettors with a win or a loss.  What happens then? Will bettors keep prognosticating when the quadrennial Super Bowl of prediction markets is over?  Probably not, says DiPeppe, an attendee at the semiannual mtnDAO hacker house gathering who runs far-smaller competitor Hedgehog Markets. He reckons that 90% of prediction markets trading volume is ""all around politics,"" and will likely evaporate when this cycle is over, as it has before.  DiPeppe mused: ""Once November 6 hits, is there enough liquidity"" to keep market makers and other behind-the-scenes players sufficiently interested to support trading on prediction markets? He doubts it.  To weather the coming drought, Hedgehog Markets is building a type of prediction market that is less tradeable, but in his view more enduring than Polymarket's binary shares-based model for highly publicized events, which needs a lot of liquidity to work as designed.  Hedgehog focuses instead on the ""long tail"" of bettable events that have fandoms willing to put money on their favored outcome but aren't too concerned about trading their position. It's more similar to sports betting experiences prevalent on DraftKings and FanDuel, where bettors take a gamble on odds and let it ride, than a stock market.  ""There's clearly people interested in sports betting. It's all short-term, same thing with crypto: It's a lot of memecoin, short-term trading,"" DiPeppe said. ""So how do we cater with a market type that fits this shorter-term time frame?""  Roll your own  Doing away with stock market-type trading gives Hedgehog more flexibility in engaging its user base, said DiPeppe. For example, users can spin up custom prediction markets, place their own bet on the outcome, and hope someone else takes them up on the opposite point of view. (Polymarket allows community members to suggest markets in its Discord server, but the company decides which ones to publish.)  DiPeppe thinks the same mindset behind memecoin factory Pump.Fun's success could pay dividends with custom prediction markets. There, any community can create a token in seconds and release it into the world where people trade it for ""fun."" He thinks there's fun to be found with prediction markets too.  Custom prediction markets come with potential minefields. What happens when someone creates a betting market in which the outcome differs from the contemplated scenarios? (For example: a tie game where bettors only thought one team or the other could win).  There's no clean way of resolving things when the prediction market is built atop a market maker or order book, according to DiPeppe. Even returning the pot 50-50 between opposing sides ‚Äì a solution that might feel most fair ‚Äì ends up rewarding those who bought in at, say, 20% odds, while punishing those who took 80%.  Hedgehog's dispute resolution is cleaner, DiPeppe argued. A custom-made market that ends in purgatory can simply return the same amount of money to bettors that they originally put in, he said.  Another potential problem: what if insiders play their own market? Perhaps someone created a market asking whether, say, a presidential candidate will mention the word ""potato"" onstage at a debate? Such a market might catch some bets from people thinking it to be unlikely (or from people who think otherwise).  What if the candidate places a bet in that market, too? If they know what they're going to say, then they could place a large bet based on the insider information. Would that not be insider trading?  Yes and no, said DiPeppe. Prediction markets are all about using trading to seek the truth. If someone who knows the truth trades on it, then other market participants, and bystanders among the general public, will become better informed.  ""Anybody could launch their own NFT collection, anybody could launch their own meme coin. Will communities want to do the same thing?"" with prediction markets, DiPeppe asked. He's betting on it.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/08/29/can-prediction-market-boom-continue-after-election-this-crypto-team-has-a-plan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70b4071a2aad746e5797420cc5a22eb0cf1e389a-5033x2831.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390506,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2Sz3,1724924843,Indian Court Orders Scam Websites Using Crypto Exchange Mudrex's Name to Be Taken Down,"An Indian court has ordered the takedown of websites using Mudrex's brand to scam people.  The Ministry of Communications was given a week to comply with the order.  Cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex won a court order asking India's Ministry of Communication to take down as many as 38 websites using the company's name to carry out scams.  The Delhi High Court's Aug. 23 judgement, passed within a day of the petition, gives the ministry a week to comply. The ministry, the designated authority to take down fake websites, did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.  Mudrex approached the court after around 15 people contacted customer support or came to its office in Bengaluru to say that they had been scammed.  ""We estimate the actual number of retail investors scammed could be 1,000, and the estimated loss could be in excess of about $50,000,"" Mudrex CEO and co-founder Edul Patel said in an interview.  Scammers impersonating Mudrex employees on messaging service Telegram would lure retail investors by promising rewards and work opportunities if they performed certain tasks, including writing Google reviews. They also used fake websites under the Mudrex name and ""invited the general public to invest on these websites, collecting monies from them illegally and frequently,"" the court order said.  Amit Rangari, Mudrex's legal head said the police complaint was filed in Bengaluru on March 23, well before prominent cryptocurrency exchange WazirX suffered a $234 million hack. The July exploit cost WazirX almost 45% of customer funds and the company has since been struggling to find solutions.  ""We don't know if any action was taken after our police complaint,"" Patel told CoinDesk. ""Because people continued to get scammed in the months following we decided to take a more formal approach, a direct line of communication with the ministry, and the only way we can get that is if we had a High Court order.""  Asked if this could add to the nervousness among Indian retailers after the WazirX hack Patel said that he hoped ""it works more in our favor, than against it.""

Related Reading: XRP Poised For Over 5,000% ‚ÄòExplosive Charge‚Äô, Analyst Says This sudden fall has left many analysts and investors wondering about the future course of some of the top digital assets, hence underlining how volatile the market is wrought by macroeconomic events and changing mood among investors. üìä Crypto‚Äôs latest retrace is coming after longs were pouring in on exchanges like @dYdX at the highest rate since Bitcoin‚Äôs All-Time High craze in March. Greed suddenly came pouring in on August 25th, and liquidations happened swiftly. When funding rates get extreme in either‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/siXhAI46VQ ‚Äî Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 27, 2024 Meanwhile, based on figures provided by Santiment, long positions have been transpiring at the fastest rate since Bitcoin‚Äôs peak in March, which is indicative of a spike in market optimism-or perhaps greed-around August 25th. The wave of liquidations appeared to catch the cryptocurrency market by surprise, which fully ended its optimistic sentiment and led into a steep correction in typical fashion for the wild swings of crypto. Santiment says such sudden market shifts are often driven by excessive leverage, as when imbalanced funding rates herald an impending correction by way of the market resetting. Economic Factors At Play Likewise, speculations of US monetary policy are one of the key drivers for this recent change in price. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at a probable interest rate cut this year in the last meeting, adding more fuel to speculation of more liquidity in the market. Since there is a traditional weakening of the US dollar when interest rates are low, it makes cryptocurrencies more attractive to investors. According to Ryan Lee, the chief analyst at Bitget Research, Bitcoin may range between $54,000 and $72,000, while Ethereum may range between $2,250 and $3,350 in September. But again, these are not without their own set of disclaimers since the market is always open to surprises which might change this trend. Trading Volume And Market Activity Despite the declines, however, trading volume has jumped. Whereas an upsurge in trading volume could indicate panic selling by investors attempting to cut their losses, it might also be interpreted as quite the opposite ‚Äì that investors feel bullish and are buying into what they perceive to be undervalued prices in anticipation of a market recovery. For example, the trading volume of Bitcoin exceeded $30.5 billion, a 30% rise. It also usually means that some traders are closing their positions while others are benefiting from the great discounted rates. The reaction of the market to this development will finally determine the direction both Bitcoin and Ethereum travel.

42390509,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2TJZ,1724919505,Polymarket Bettors Miss Out on $270K Due to Pavel Durov's Early Release,"Bettors on Polymarket were largely wrong about how long Telegram CEO Pavel Durov would be detained by French authorities.  Durov was released on bail on Aug. 28, earlier than many bettors anticipated.  French authorities are no longer holding Telegram CEO Pavel Durov, and as of Aug. 28 he was out on bail. The decision took bettors on Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction market, by surprise, costing them a total of $270,000 in missed winnings.  Durov was formally indicted Wednesday and released on bail after he posted a 5 million-euro ($5.6 million) bond while agreeing to report to police twice weekly and to stay in the country.  The quick release contrasted with bettors' overall sentiment that an extended detention was more probable. At one point, the chance of an August release was pegged in the mid-30%s while a release before October was priced 75%-90%. The August relase probabilty climbed to 50% in the hours before French authorities announced he was out on bail.  Each bet comprises a ""Yes"" and a ""No"" side. Each share pays out $1 in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency that trades at par with the U.S. dollar, if the prediction comes true, and zero if not.  In total, bettors missed out on $270,000 by betting ""No"" on an August release, and ""No"" for before October. Likely, bettors had their money on French authorities keeping Durov for as long as possible.  As a man of considerable wealth and multiple nationalities ‚Äì including the United Arab Emirates, which does not extradite its citizens ‚Äì Durov would have the means to flee the country, which is why bettors thought France would do all it could to keep him in detention.  On the other side of the trade, user Champ correctly forecast Durov would be released in August and before October, and was the largest holder of the ""Yes"" side of both contracts.  In total, Champ won $26,138 between the two contracts, meaning they took home $56,638 after the winnings were added to the value of the original bet.  Another contract gives Durov a 6% chance of fleeing France by mid-month, meaning bettors expect him to comply with the terms of his bail.  Despite Durov's legal challenges being the talk of the crypto community this week, it won't be center stage when Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump holds a live townhall in Wisconsin later Thursday.  Bettors are only giving a 14% chance he'll mention Durov's name during the event, compared to a 92% chance he'll say ""MAGA"" and an 84% chance he'll use the term ""Border Czar.""  However, Trump can often be unpredictable.  In a recent interview with Elon Musk bettors wagered over $250,000 on the former president saying ""Tesla,"" causing the bet to peak at 79%. Instead, he refered to the carmaker only as ""your cars.""",NEGATIVE,USDC,MARKET | REGULATION | USDC,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/29/polymarket-bettors-miss-out-on-270k-due-to-pavel-durovs-early-release,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d4fe74da08eb828c68a0a3bcd42213300277a0f-848x464.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32959582,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638475,1724917812,The Entire Crypto Bull Run Hinges On These Factors: Analyst,"In a thread shared with his 538,000 followers on X, crypto analyst Miles Deutscher highlights the vital importance of retail investors to the sustainability of the crypto bull market. To understand the possible return of the crypto bull run, Deutscher believes it is essential to understand what has happened in recent years. Deutscher recalls the substantial rally from March 2020 through November 2021, highlighting the extreme gains made across various altcoins. Understanding The Crypto Bull Run Dynamics ‚ÄúFrom March 2020 until November 2021, the crypto market rallied 2,672%, with many alts pulling 50-100x+ multiples,‚Äù Deutscher states, pointing to a period characterized by significant financial stimulus and increased public interest due to global lockdowns. However, the glory days were short-lived, as Deutscher pointed out, marking the peak of the market in November 2021 followed by a steep decline. The downward spiral was accentuated by the LUNA & UST collapse in May 2022, which not only erased significant market value but also exacerbated the decline across the broader crypto market. ‚ÄúCrypto technically topped in November 2021. But it wasn‚Äôt until May 2022 that crypto would be delivered its final death blow: The LUNA & UST collapse,‚Äù he explained, illustrating the precariousness of crypto investments during that period. Related Reading: Signs Of A New Crypto Winter? Warren Buffett‚Äôs $1 Billion Stock Sales Spark Market Crash Fears The aftermath of these events led to a widespread exodus of retail investors, who were either financially devastated or disillusioned by the dramatic downturns. ‚ÄúIf you were burnt financially, you left. If you weren‚Äôt burnt financially, you still left (price/time capitulation),‚Äù Deutscher explains, capturing the deep-seated anxiety that permeated the retail investor base following the market‚Äôs collapse. Despite the challenging environment, 2023 ushered in a new wave of optimism with significant institutional movements, notably BlackRock‚Äôs application for a Bitcoin spot ETF in June, which was later approved. ‚ÄúOn the 16th of June, BlackRock applied for a Bitcoin spot ETF This not only signaled a positive catalyst on the horizon but a paradigm shift in the way BTC was being viewed by major institutions,‚Äù Deutscher highlighted, pointing to a critical moment that potentially marked the beginning of a new era for Bitcoin and possibly the broader crypto market. As of January 2024, the crypto market had seen a surge in Bitcoin prices, reaching new all-time highs following the successful launch of the ETF. ‚ÄúOver $17b has flowed into the BTC spot ETFs so far this year,‚Äù Deutscher notes, underscoring the significant impact of institutional investment on Bitcoin‚Äôs valuation and the broader market sentiment. However, Deutscher tempers expectations regarding the altcoin market, which has not seen parallel success. The lack of a similar rally in altcoins is attributed by Deutscher to the new market dynamics introduced by the ETF, which altered traditional liquidity flows and investment patterns. ‚ÄúThe primary driver of this cycle has been the BTC ETF. This is vastly different from the last cycle, where the primary driver was macro conditions,‚Äù he remarks. When Will The Bull Run Return? Looking ahead, Deutscher speculates on the conditions that might entice retail investors to return. He emphasizes the critical role of Bitcoin achieving new all-time highs, suggesting that Bitcoin reaching or surpassing $100,000 could ignite renewed interest across the crypto sector. ‚ÄúYes, many of the aforementioned issues like altcoin dispersion would still exist, but it would definitely pave over some cracks. A BTC rally = media attention, people front running an altcoin rotation, renewed optimism,‚Äù he added. Related Reading: New Memecoin Popcat Claws Its Way Up, Dominates Top 100 Cryptos With 62% Rally Deutscher also highlights the natural inclination of humans towards gambling, noting that the thrill of high returns might quickly attract retail investors back to the market if altcoins show sustained rallies. He referenced the Pareto principle to remind followers that significant market gains often occur late in the investment cycle. ‚Äú80% of gains in a bull market come in the last 20%, of the move. Retail joins the party late. We simply may just be too early (in terms of cycle duration we comparatively still are), Deutscher states. Additionally, he points to the potential of emerging technologies in AI, gaming, and decentralized finance (DeFi) to create compelling new use cases for crypto. He suggested that just a few successful applications could drive widespread adoption, fostering a more sustainable interest in the crypto market. Because of that Deutscher remains optimistic about the return of retail investors. He concludes, ‚Äúso in conclusion, yes ‚Äì retail is (mostly) gone. There are valid reasons why, and this cycle is fundamentally different because of them. But it won‚Äôt take much for retail to return. And that day may be sooner than you think.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $59,650.

Van De Poppe‚Äôs outlook comes at a time when Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has continued to experience significant downward pressure, much like its counterpart, Bitcoin. In the past 24 hours, ETH has seen a decline of 3.7%, bringing its current trading price to $2,491. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Finally Over the Slump? These 2 On-Chain Metrics Suggests a Bullish Turn Ethereum Outlook: When Will A Price Recovery Happen? Van De Poppe noted in the post that Ethereum was rejected at the 0.046 BTC level and is now approaching high timeframe support areas. The analyst mentioned the possibility of a bullish divergence forming, which could lead to a rally later this week or next. However, this potential recovery is contingent on ETH finding support and reversing its current trajectory. $ETH is super weak, it remains to be the case.

Marks suggested that Bitcoin‚Äôs earlier successful breakout above $67,000 hints at what‚Äôs next for ETH. He speculated that if Bitcoin could continue to climb, it could pave the way for Ethereum to reach its target of $4,811 or higher. However, this potential recovery¬†depends¬†on Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to maintain its upward momentum and break above key resistance levels. Marks noted: Bitcoin climbing even more for ETH‚Äôs ‚Äòfollowing‚Äô fulfillment to $4811.6 could result BTC breaking above $67,559, which opens up $116,000+ and much, much more room to lead the crypto market into heightened bullish phases. Simplicity. Market Liquidations Surge As Traders Bet On Rising Prices Meanwhile, the recent price drops in Ethereum and Bitcoin have significantly impacted traders, with many being caught off guard by the sudden downturn. According to data from Coinglass, over 92,000 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours, resulting in total liquidations of $325.03 million. Ethereum accounted for $86 million of these liquidations, with $67.90 million coming from long positions. This suggests that many traders expected ETH to rise in price, only to be met with the opposite outcome. Bitcoin, too, saw substantial liquidations, accounting for $111.78 million of the total.

A clear move above the $0.60 resistance might send the price toward the $0.6050 resistance. The next major resistance is near the $0.6160 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.6250 resistance or even $0.6320 in the near term. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5720 resistance zone, it could start another decline.

The token, launched on The Open Network (TON), saw a 34% surge amid the market volatility and the blockchain‚Äôs recent outage. Its performance propelled the price to a market cap above $800 million, fueling a bullish sentiment among investors. Related Reading: XRP Remains Strong Despite Market Pullback: Analyst Forecasts $500 By 2025 TON-Based Memecoin Takes The Market By Storm DOGS is a TON-based memecoin centered around a dog mascot, ‚ÄúSpotty,‚Äù created by Telegram‚Äôs founder, Pavel Durov. The project recently announced a massive airdrop and listing on major crypto exchanges, including Binance, OKX, and Bybit. The DOGS airdrop would offer eligible users 440 billion tokens out of the 550 billion token supply. 81.5% of DOG tokens were allocated to the community, with 73% reserved for ‚ÄúTelegram Ogs, who earned DOGS in the app.‚Äù The remaining 4.5% would reward traders, sticker creators, and future community members. Additionally, 10% of the supply was allocated for the project‚Äôs team and future development, while 8.5% was reserved for liquidity on CEXs and DEXs, and listing-related events. After the listing on August 26, several crypto exchanges faced technical problems due to an ‚Äúunprecedented surge in user activity.‚Äù The high on-chain activity temporarily disrupted the exchanges‚Äô operations. The¬†activity increase also affected the Telegram Wallet. As¬†announced on the Wallet‚Äôs Telegram channel, the launch ‚Äúcreated quite a buzz,‚Äù temporarily unavailable the platform‚Äôs exchange feature. The DOGS Community channel said the launch was ‚Äúmelting TON infrastructure.‚Äù The airdrop was also linked to TON‚Äôs overload on August 27. The community reported that the blockchain disrupted block production for approximately seven hours. The TON Foundation explained that the network overload was related to DOG‚Äôs massive number of transactions. The network registered over 20 million transactions in the previous two days. This resulted in ‚Äúgarbage collection overloading many of the validators for enough time for them to lose consensus.‚Äù DOGS Becomes The Largest Gainer In 24 Hours The TON network issues were accompanied by a market retrace on Tuesday, which caused the industry to dip by over 7%. The crash caused Bitcoin (BTC) to lose its support above the $60,000 mark and dive straight to the $58,000 range. While most cryptocurrencies followed the drop, DOGS remained unfazed by the adverse market conditions. Altcoin Sherpa highlighted that the token ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt move amidst all the volatility.‚Äù Amid the turmoil, the new memecoin sensation hovered between the $0.00115-$0.001125 price range. The token saw a positive price action following the network‚Äôs restoration. DOGS saw a remarkable 33.6% price jump in the early hours of Wednesday, going from the $0.00125 mark to the $0.00167 price range. After this performance, the memecoin became the largest gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies in the last 24 hours.

According to Marks, Bitcoin exhibits several bullish patterns that point towards a recovery back to the $65,000 level. He emphasizes that while the current drop is significant, the broader market structure remains intact. Marks highlighted that one of the bullish patterns seen in Bitcoin‚Äôs near-term chart indicates a potential reversal that could lead to a recovery above $65,000. He further elaborated that on a larger scale, another bullish formation suggests a possible 21% increase from the current levels, potentially pushing Bitcoin‚Äôs price to over $73,000.

Warren Buffett‚Äôs $1 Billion Stock Sales Spark Market Crash Fears,"Amid growing global economic uncertainties looming over financial markets, including crypto, Warren Buffett has made a significant move by selling an additional $982 million worth of Bank of America stock. Buffett‚Äôs Sale Of Bank Of America Shares According to Bloomberg, this sale marks the continuation of his conglomerate‚Äôs reduction of investments in the second-largest US bank. Berkshire Hathaway has trimmed its stake by nearly 13% through sales since mid-July, generating $5.4 billion in proceeds. These sales mark Buffett‚Äôs most substantial retreat from an investment that has historically signaled an endorsement of Bank of America‚Äôs leadership under CEO Brian Moynihan, a figure the 93-year-old investing figure has praised in public. Related Reading: MakerDAO Rebrands As ‚ÄòSky‚Äô: Two New Tokens To Be Launched On Sept 18 Adding to the narrative, technical analyst Jamil has underscored the significance of Buffett‚Äôs latest sales by questioning the rationale behind his decision to dump nearly $1 billion worth of Bank of America stock. Citing previous breaches and the near completion of ‚Äúbacktesting‚Äù on the Bank of America stock chart, Jamil hints at an impending market shift, suggesting the potential for a significant downturn that could drive the bank‚Äôs share price toward the $14 mark. Crypto Market Rattles While these developments may not directly pertain to the crypto market, they raise pertinent questions about the broader financial landscape. They could signal preparedness from large investors for a potential global economic downturn that could reverberate across various sectors, including the digital asset industry. Recent events, such as the turbulence in the Japanese stock market on August 5, resulted in a notable over 20% correction in leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH, further showcasing the fragility of the current financial climate. Related Reading: XRP Remains Strong Despite Market Pullback: Analyst Forecasts $500 By 2025 Interestingly, Buffett‚Äôs actions come in the wake of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs (Fed) recent dovish stance, with Chair Jerome Powell hinting at the likelihood of further rate cuts in September amidst a cooling labor market. While Bitcoin initially welcomed such a stance, which surged to a one-month high of $65,000 last weekend, the broader implications of Buffett‚Äôs strategic moves and the Fed‚Äôs monetary policy signals point to a potentially turbulent economic landscape in the months ahead, with no clear certainties. This is further evidenced by the recent 6% price correction experienced by Bitcoin in the last 24 hours, which is currently trading at $58,500 and has been unable to consolidate above the key $60,000 level for over a week. On the other hand, Ethereum has seen a 4% decline in the 24-hour time frame, falling back to the $2,480 level on Wednesday, along with the broader market correction led by BTC.
