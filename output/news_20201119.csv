42385151,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnPx7,1605828190,Goldman Sachs Expects Digital Yuan to Reach 1B Users Within 10 Years,"The digital yuan, China’s planned national virtual currency, would account for 15% of total consumption payments in 10 years, helping commercial banks gain more ground from fintech companies, according to a Nov. 17 Goldman Sachs report shared with CoinDesk.      The Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DC/EP) could be a more attractive alternative to existing digital payment services provided by fintech companies in a cashless environment, said the 81-page report. It cited anonymity enabled by the separation of a bank account and the digital yuan wallet, offline payment and interconnectivity with various payment options as contributing to the digital yuan’s success.      “In 10 years we expect DC/EP to reach 1 billion addressable users, 1.6 trillion rmb ($229 billion) in issuance, 19 trillion rmb ($2.7 trillion) in annual Total Payment Value (TPV) and account for 15% of total consumption payments,” the report said.      Goldman Sachs said consumption payments – meaning the transactions in which users make purchases via a digital payment platform – will be where banks and fintech providers compete most aggressively.      “Consumption is the major source of income for [third-party payment] (3PP) providers given the higher take rate than transfers and finance; thus consumption payments are regarded as ‘commercial payments’ by payment institutions,” the report said.    Leveling the playing field    The report came after China’s top financial regulators halted Ant Group’s record-setting initial public offering. The company, which is the fintech affiliate of China’s IT giant Alibaba, has one of the most popular digital payment mobile apps Alipay. Beijing’s authorities also proposed a set of new anti-monopolistic practices to rein in fintech companies in the country.      The adoption of the digital yuan will likely slow the rate that banks have been ceding ground to fintech, and even reverse market share losses over the long-term if DC/EP gains in popularity, the report said.      The report noted China Merchant Bank (CMB) and Ping An Bank (PAB) may be among the beneficiaries from the new digital payment ecosystem, as third-party payment platforms would have to face more competition in the long term.      “A 10% increase in the bank app users would lift revenues by 2%-5%,” the report said. “PAB and CMB are best placed to commercialize returning app users given their leading retail franchises, premium client bases, superior fintech capability and strategic focus on retail finance.”      Currently, Alipay and Tencent’s digital payment arm WeChat Pay still dominate China’s digital payment industry. The two companies account for over 90% of mobile banking transactions in the last three months of 2019.      “Commercial banks will be the only institutions permitted to operate in DC/EP exchange as it is the digitalization of legal tender,” the bank noted. “This will effectively level the playing field with fintech platforms, enabling banks to once again compete head-to-head with them in consumption payments.”    Fintech growth    However, fintech companies will still be focused on retail banking services, taking large shares of growth in the retail financial services market in the next five years as the central bank gradually increases the adoption for the digital yuan.      “Over the next five years, we expect Fintech to grow revenues at almost double the rate of banks as they continue to capture incremental market share across the retail finance ecosystem,” the bank said.      The report also notes DC/EP would not disintermediate the commercial banks since the virtual currency is replacing cash rather than savings. In addition, the digital yuan wallet will not pay interest to depositors and most of the transactions will be in small amounts, the report said.      According to the report, China has 900 million mobile internet users as of 2019, making up over 64% of its population. The country’s M0/M2 ratio is only 4%, which is one of the lowest cash usage among major economies and it is still declining. Ninety-six percent of Chinese banking services are processed on electronic devices.      The bank forecasts a 3 trillion rmb ($428.6 billion) revenue pool for retail finance by 2025 (excluding mortgages) as growth in payments and retail lending slows but wealth management and insurance agencies remain brisk.

The Texas State Securities Board on Thursday ordered 15 firms to cease and desist operations with a series of emergency orders against crypto, forex and binary options hubs that purport to be based in Texas.      Ten firms are named in the first order: Proactive Expert Trading, Reliable Miners, BitcoinFX Options, Sure Trade Earnings, CryptoTradeFXWay, Proactive ExpertTrade, ReliableFX Internal Trade, MaxFX Internal Trade, AntPoolTop Mining and ExpertTrades247. Regulators say one man, James Blundell, pumped all 10 on social media.      Three are named in the second: Binary Trade Forex, FX Trades and IQTrade. Regulators say the trio are not registered to sell securities in Texas. They're peddling highly lucrative, low risk investing options – at least according to the customer testimonials, which TSSB alleges are fake.      One firm, a crypto binary option and forex investment platform called GenuisPlanFxPro, is named in the third. Regulators say GenuisPlanFxPro falsely claims to hold a handful of international financial licenses.      TSSB officials alleged a common thread across all 15 firms is their savvy use of social media to draw investors in and drain them dry.      “Bad actors know how to use social media and internet websites to create the pretense of legitimate operations. They can also use this technology to quickly reach large numbers of potential victims,” said Enforcement Director Joe Rotunda in a statement.      “Their websites often go dark, social media often goes dormant and fraudsters often disappear.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $18,026 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2.1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $17,364-$18,170  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price rise stalled somewhat Thursday, with the world’s oldest cryptocurrency hitting as high as $18,170 before dipping below the $18,000 level, but back to $18,026 as of press time.      Volume contributed to the weakening price action. At $1.79 billion, Wednesday was the highest volume day for major USD/BTC spot exchanges since way back on March 13, when volumes hit $1.98 billion the day after the “Black Thursday” crash. Today, daily volume on these exchanges were at a comparably tepid $867 million.      A volume pullback from the second-largest day on the USD/BTC spot market in 2020 isn’t deterring analysts on their bullish prognostications.      “The current upward move seems more sustainable than the 2017 bull run as institutional investors are now positioning in bitcoin whereas it was only retail speculation back in 2017,” said Elie Le Rest, partner at quant firm ExoAlpha. “Bitcoin confirms by its recent price move that it has a place in a diversified portfolio.”      Read More: Deutsche Bank Says Investors Increasingly Prefer Bitcoin Over Gold      “The market's infrastructure, regulatory regime and overall maturity is much more robust than previously,” said John Willock, CEO of crypto asset manager Tritium. “I fully expect a couple of pullbacks from these nominal mile markers such as $18,000, $19,000 and $20,000, but I do expect we should see the overall momentum continue through the rest of the year.”      Since Oct. 20, bitcoin’s 30-day volatility has been steadily rising, indicating that some price gyrations may still be on the horizon.      “No assets go parabolic forever,” noted Michael Gord, chief executive officer for trading firm Global Digital Assets. “Bitcoin has gone up over 50% in the past month and is due for a correction.”      “Long term I’m still very bullish and still seeing increasing interest from more traditional investors in bitcoin and other digital assets,” Gord added.

CME, a professional investor venue, has flirted with $1 billion in bitcoin open interest this week, a sign institutions are increasingly hedging crypto positions.      Even permabulls like Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based over-the-counter crypto trader, are prepared for some bumps in the road should bitcoin work its way to an all-time high.      “I expect a much larger drop pretty soon,” Kugelberg told CoinDesk. “But in all I can see BTC going to $23,000-$24,000 in the next month or two.”    Ether moving out of DeFi    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Thursday, trading around $475 and climbing 0.55% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The amount of ether “locked” in decentralized finance, or DeFi, is declining. The fall began Nov. 14, going from 8.9 million to 7.7 million ETH as of press time, according to aggregator DeFi Pulse.      Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner for investment firm Tellurian Capital, suspects some of the ether movement out of DeFi might have to do with Ethereum’s ambitious “2.0” project. This requires some capital allocation to a smart contract set aside for staking something known as the “beacon chain” to launch the new network.      “There is the need to find another 400,000 ETH to fill the first phase of staking into ETH 2.0 by the end of November,” said Bonnefous. “So this might explain some of the leakage out of DeFi.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Thursday, mostly green.

42385147,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnPtL,1605818818,The Complete Case for $100K Bitcoin,"What a year – a global pandemic, a wavering stock market, rising numbers of unemployed people and continued uncertainty in global markets. Yet, we saw the bitcoin price recover from $5,300 in March to almost $18,000 at time of writing. That’s almost a 240% return within nine months.      For regular investors, the burning question is whether bitcoin is becoming overpriced. Is it too late to buy bitcoin?    Hong Fang is the CEO at OKCoin, a U.S. licensed, fiat-focused cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in San Francisco. Hong spent eight years at Goldman Sachs, leaving as VP of Investment Banking. She is a graduate of Peking University in Beijing, China, and has an MBA from the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business.    If we put aside short-term volatility and take a long-term perspective, there is a reasonable path for the price of bitcoin to reach over $500,000 in the next decade. To go even further, I think BTC is likely to hit $100,000 in the next 12 months. Significant upside has yet to play out for bitcoin.    Bitcoin is a 'store of value'    When we talk about the valuation of an asset, the first step is to understand the fundamental economics. Equities, bonds and real estate, for example, often derive their value from generating cash flows; therefore, valuation of these assets involves projecting future cash flows. Commodities, on the other hand, are more utility based and therefore their prices are anchored by industrial supply and demand. Before taking any action on bitcoin, I suggest asking yourself, “What is bitcoin for?” Use this as a baseline to form your own view of the value of bitcoin and its fair price range in a given time horizon.      Here’s my take as a HODLer:    Bitcoin is sound money and the first native internet money in human society.  It is scarce (21 million fixed supply), durable (digital), accessible (blockchain is 24/7), divisible (1 bitcoin = 100 million satoshis), verifiable (open-source Bitcoin Core) and most importantly, censorship resistant (encrypted). With these superior monetary qualities in one asset, bitcoin is a great store of value. Once it reaches a critical mass of adoption as a store of value, bitcoin has huge potential to grow into a global reserve currency (and universal unit of account, too) over time.  The history of money shows us that natural forms of money generally go through three phases of evolution: first as collectible (speculation on scarcity), second as investment (store of value), third as money (unit of account) and payment (medium of exchange). As bitcoin goes through different phases, its valuation scheme varies, too. In my view, bitcoin is currently in the early stage of phase II. Below is a short summary of the two phases bitcoin has been through and respective value implications.  Bitcoin as collectible    Between its inception in 2009 and 2018, bitcoin was in its “collectible” phase. Only a small cluster of cypherpunks believed in bitcoin as “future sound money.” It was hard to come up with a valuation scheme for bitcoin that matched its fundamentals. It was also too early to tell whether bitcoin could succeed in building consensus around its “store of value” superiority.      Bitcoin is built as a basic utility and doesn’t generate cash flow, so there is no way to forecast its price based on cash flows. Its circulating supply was easy to calculate, but it was really hard to estimate demand given the fickle nature of speculative trading. When speculative demand surged and drained out of the system, particularly around the initial coin offering (ICO) boom in 2017, we saw bitcoin’s price explode from $900 in early 2017 to $19,000 by the end of 2017, and then down to $3,700 by the end of 2018.      Bitcoin’s opponents usually attack bitcoin’s price volatility as a bug, but I believe that bitcoin’s price volatility is a unique and smart self-marketing feature. It was key to its survival in the early days. Bitcoin operates as a decentralized global network. There is no coordinated marketing team out there promoting bitcoin’s utility to the world. It is the dramatic price volatility that has continued to attract attention from non-followers, some of whom were later converted into believers, thus driving the continued momentum of bitcoin adoption.    Bitcoin as investment    Bitcoin went through an identity crisis as “sound money” before it graduated into the second stage as an investment vehicle. Starting with the scalability debate in 2017, when the network became congested with historical high volume and transaction costs surged, its community had serious controversies (some called it “civil war”) involving the future path of bitcoin.      See also: Bitcoin 101      As a result, on Aug. 1, 2017, the bitcoin blockchain was hard forked to create the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) chain to allow larger blocks as BTC stuck to a block size limit with SegWit adoption to enable a second-layer solution. On November 15, 2018, the BCH network forked again into Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (BSV).      Fortunately, bitcoin (BTC in this case) survived its growing pains (and the industry-wide bear market) and thrived thereafter. It is also through such public disputes (and price performance after hard forks) that BTC support and dominance has been further solidified, with an increasing number of addresses holding BTC and decreasing volatility.      Then came 2020.    Banner year    This year has been an extraordinary year in many aspects, but it is truly a milestone year for bitcoin. The coronavirus pandemic has brought emotional and economic stress to many people on a global basis. On top of that, 12 years after the 2008 financial crisis and the publication of the Bitcoin white paper, we are reminded how easily our economy could be flooded with new money printed out of thin air; $3 trillion in new money was created in just three months in the United States, about 14% of U.S. GDP in 2019. The U.S. was not alone.      In 2020, it has been extremely hard for responsible savers to find reliable, real yields to preserve their hard-earned wealth. American middle-class families have had to either accept zero to negative interest rates at banks and debasement risk or bet in the all-time-high equity market when the real economy struggles, not knowing when the music will stop. In other countries, people must fight an uphill battle everyday to simply preserve the earning power of their salaries.      These macro themes are too strong for anyone to ignore. In contrast, the Bitcoin network had its successful third halving on May 11, 2020, highlighting the beauty of having monetary discipline pre-written into code and executed by the global network smoothly ever since. As a result, more investors in traditional finance (Wall Street institutions included) have started to realize that bitcoin has a unique hedging capability against long-term inflation risk, with a risk-reward profile better than its closest monetary cousin, gold.      Different from its 2017 ride, bitcoin’s current run-up is characterized by more vocal institutional endorsement: Square and MicroStrategy allocate treasury cash into bitcoin; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) allow U.S. banks to offer crypto asset custody; PayPal enabling crypto buying and selling; Fidelity making a case for 5% asset allocation and doubling down on crypto engineer recruiting; well-established traditional asset managers including Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmilller announcing public support for bitcoin. The mainstream momentum is building up.      For the first time since its historic inception, bitcoin officially entered mainstream media as “digital gold,” a legit and credible (and liquid) alternative asset to consider for both individuals and institutions. The earlier comparison to ""Dutch tulip mania"" starts to fade. As more people educate themselves about what bitcoin is and start to embrace it not as a speculative trading asset but as a long-term asset allocation option, we can now look at its fundamentals and anchor price ranges with a simple supply-and-demand math.      Below are three scenarios used to triangulate bitcoin’s potential one-year trajectory.    Scenario 1: 1-2% US household wealth allocation?  According to the Federal Reserve, U.S. household wealth reached $112 trillion by June 2020 (top 10% owns two-thirds of the wealth).  1%-2% of $112 trillion = $1.1 trillion to $2.2 trillion potential demand (Fidelity’s most recent report actually recommends 5% target allocation).  Current total circulating BTC is about 18.5 million. To keep it simple, let’s assume 21 million max supply are all up for sale.  Divide the potential demand by max supply, we get a price range of $56,000-$112,000. This scenario does not account for the rest of the world ($400 trillion global family wealth, according to Credit Suisse Wealth Report 2020). If we assume 1%-2% allocation of global family wealth, we will be looking at a $228,000-$456,000 price range. Would this happen in the next 12 months? Likely not. Can this happen within the next decade? I think that’s very possible.  Scenario 2: 2%-3% of global high-net-worth individual allocation?  According to Capgemini World Wealth Report 2020, global HNWI wealth stood at $74 trillion by end of 2019 (~13% alternative, 14.6% real estate, 17% fixed income, 25% cash and cash equivalent, 30% equity).  2%-3% of $74 trillion = $1.48 trillion-$2.22 trillion potential demand.  Divide the potential demand by max supply, we get a price range of $70,000-$105,000.  This scenario does look at global data, but only accounts for high-net-worth individual (HNWI) allocation, assuming that this segment has more assets to invest and investment decisions are more driven by institutional asset managers and advisers. I am also assuming a higher range of allocation here because HNWI are generally better positioned to take on more risks in search of higher risk-adjusted return.  Scenario 3: Catching up with gold?  There has been a long-standing argument that bitcoin would catch up to gold in market cap once it is widely accepted as a “digital and superior version of gold.”  Current gold market cap is $9 trillion. This is about 2% of total global wealth and 12% of global HNWI wealth.  100% gold market cap means $428,000 price point for bitcoin. Can we get there in 12 months? Probably too aggressive an assumption. Can bitcoin rise to 20%-25% of gold in 12 months (aka 2.4%-3% global HNWI wealth allocation)? Possible. That would give us a price range of $80,000-$110,000.    There are additional factors that could add more upside to bitcoin. Given that we are still in the early stage of mainstream adoption, I don't want to over-emphasize them, but I want to lay them out just to keep the perspective.    Potential allocation from corporate treasury management. We are already seeing early signs of that with Square and MicroStrategy. Square recently allocated about 1.8% of its cash balance to buy $50 million in bitcoin. Sizing up corporate demand for bitcoin is tricky, though. Each company has its own cash flow and growth profile, which will affect its risk appetite in asset allocation.  Potential allocation from foreign exchange reserves of all sovereign states. According to the International Monetary Fund, the global foreign exchange (forex) reserve was $12 trillion by June 2020, with the top three reserve currencies in U.S. dollars $7 trillion (58.3%), euros $2 trillion (16.7%), and yen $650 billion (5.4%). Is it possible to see sovereign countries allocate some of their forex reserves into bitcoin? I believe that trend will emerge over time when bitcoin’s superiority in “store of value” further plays out in the next five to 10 years. Assuming 25% allocation ($3 trillion, a little more than euro allocation), that is another $140,000 upside. Bitcoin catching up on the U.S. dollar as a dominant global currency reserve could take a long time to materialize, if at all but it is not impossible to see bitcoin among the top 3 list.  Not 100% of bitcoin’s max supply would be available for trade. There is about 18.5 million in circulation. About 10% of that has been dormant for over 10 years. It’s tricky to estimate how much of the total bitcoin in circulation will actually be up for sale at different price points.  None of the above account for the dollar's inflation rate in the years to come, which is about 2%-3% annually as a baseline. Neither do these scenarios account for the network effect of bitcoin, the possibility of bitcoin becoming more ubiquitous and reliable as a unit of account.  What could go wrong?    A one-sided investment case is never a good one. It is prudent to play devil’s advocate and assess downside risks. What are the major risks that may derail a bitcoin bull run?    Protocol risk    The biggest risk always comes from inside. Bitcoin has inherent value only because it has the unique characteristics of “sound money” (scarce, durable, accessible, divisible, verifiable and censorship resistant). If any of those qualities are compromised, the foundation to its investment case will be eroded or gone.      Such protocol risks were high in its first few years, but after two major controversial hard forks and three successful halvings, it seems that protocol-level risks are somewhat contained. The Bitcoin ecosystem has been consistent in independent developer support. According to Electric Capital’s developer report, the Bitcoin developer ecosystem has maintained 100+ independent developers every month since 2014. Additionally, we’ve also seen an increase in commits to the Bitcoin Core codebase in 2020, reaching a peak in May (around the time when the third halving happened).      It’s also encouraging to see major development milestones emerging on the Bitcoin Core network, including the merge of Signet, Schnorr/Taproot and increased focus on fuzz testing, to name a few. These protocol-level developments continue to enhance the privacy and scalability of the network, boosting bitcoin’s technical stability as a currency.      To ensure a healthy and safe future for bitcoin, it is critical to ensure the Bitcoin Core developer community remains independent and decentralized and continues to make steady improvements in critical areas like security and privacy. This is also why we have been passionate about providing no-strings sponsorship to Bitcoin Core developers and projects at OKCoin. Investing in bitcoin development helps reduce the protocol risk.    Concentration risk    This, to me, is the second0biggest risk to bitcoin. Bitcoin’s ethos is to empower individuals through decentralization, but the risk of concentration always exists.      Within the network, the risk lies in the concentration of mining power. It is not an industry secret that 65% of the world’s hash power is in China. If mining power is coalesced, a mining pool or group of miners can manipulate network transactions, creating fake coins through double-spending, in turn impacting the market price. However, there is also the argument that such concentration risk is inevitable but to some extent harmless, too, given how the network incentive has been designed for bitcoin. In other words, the incentives in the form of new bitcoins and transaction fees should work to keep the majority of the nodes honest because it is economically costly to cheat (not because it is hard or impossible to cheat). The assumption is that the mining participants are all rational and make economic decisions.      Externally, similar risk lies in ownership concentration. Investors, or ""whales,"" holding significant amounts of bitcoin can influence and even manipulate the market by triggering a change in price based on their buy/sell timing. Given that an individual (or an entity) can own more than one bitcoin address, it’s hard to paint an accurate picture of bitcoin ownership. So this risk does exist. This is also why I feel very passionate about promoting financial literacy and crypto knowledge. I believe that we can build a healthier and more sustainable future if more individuals come to understand what bitcoin is about and start to embrace it. The first institutional wave is exciting to see, but if bitcoin ownership tilts too much toward the institutional end, we would be defeated in our mission of building a more inclusive and individually empowering network.    Political risk    Another major risk comes from sovereign governments. Given that bitcoin is positioned as future money, it is possible that sovereign governments ban it for fear of threatening fiat currencies. Again, such risks are highest in earlier years before bitcoin builds meaningful adoption momentum. Actually, such bans have already happened in several countries (India in 2018, for example, which was revoked in 2020). Central bank digital currency (CBDC) experiments around the world could also have an impact on how bitcoin’s future plays out.      This year has seen the first wave of institutional endorsement for bitcoin, and therefore 2020 will be recognized as a milestone year in alleviating this political risk. When publicly listed companies, asset managers and well-known individuals start to own bitcoin and speak in favor of bitcoin, such a ban is going to become very unpopular and hence harder to implement in countries where popular votes do matter. I hope the momentum will continue to build, making a risk of total bitcoin ban increasingly remote as time passes.    In a world of uncertainty, bitcoin gives HODLers like me confidence. It has a huge network effect that can ultimately empower every individual who believes in it and uses it.    A successful and complete ban on bitcoin will also need to take coordinated efforts of all sovereign governments, which is very unlikely. As long as there are countries that let bitcoin legally flow, bitcoin will have a chance to win – a decentralized global network cannot be shut down by any single party.      That being said, bitcoin price volatility could be amplified from time to time by domestic and geopolitical changes. In my view, political risks remain the second-largest risk to bitcoin until it becomes too big to be tampered with. We are obviously far away from that point.      There can also be a wider payment ban on bitcoin while it is being recognized as legal financial assets. Such a risk is not totally out of the picture yet. The good thing is, we are not banking on bitcoin becoming the unit of account and medium of payment in our $100,000-$500,000 scenario. When bitcoin does progress to phase III, we will not be talking about bitcoin price anymore, but instead talk about everything else’s price in bitcoin.    Adoption risk    This is a timing risk. It is quite possible that it may take much longer than expected for bitcoin to go mainstream.      The only way to manage this risk is to make sure your bitcoin portfolio is properly sized.      If you invest in bitcoin (or anything else) and worry about where its price would be in the next 12 months, your portfolio of bitcoin is probably too big for you. Size it based on your own risk tolerance and conviction level in bitcoin. Don’t do more than what you can afford (or believe in).      I also believe the unique quality of bitcoin will speak for itself over time. Bitcoin’s price chart between 2017 and 2018 very much looked like a bubble. However, if we look at bitcoin’s full trading history, there is a clear upward trend together with growing asset-holding addresses, growing active addresses and growing network computing power. The increasing mean hashrate of the Bitcoin network represents the security level that one would want to see in a network where people’s wealth is stored.      I may be on the bullish side for bitcoin’s 12-month price trajectory but I truly believe that with bitcoin, time will be our best friend.    Looking ahead    Bitcoin is unlike any other asset we have encountered before. This is a truly sound and global wealth network that will continue to grow as the world recognizes the significance of its properties. To put things in perspective, here is a recent tweet from Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, that summarizes the relevance of bitcoin as a utility and store of value.      In a world of uncertainty, bitcoin gives HODLers like me confidence. It has a huge network effect that can ultimately empower every individual who believes in it and uses it. I look forward to the continued evolution of the bitcoin ecosystem and feel excited about being part of it.",POSITIVE,BCH,BCH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Hong Fang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/19/the-complete-case-for-100k-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1afe8a9447c1eee365abaac08eae610f31e1d7e-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385167,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnQ9h,1605817366,"Lightning Network's New Liquidity Marketplace Attracts a ‘Surprising’ Mix of Individuals, Enterprises","Lightning Labs’ new liquidity marketplace, Lightning Pool, has seen more early-stage growth than its creators expected. And what’s more, a fair share of its volume is coming from individual Lightning users – not businesses.      “It’s a big surprise! Very exciting,” Lightning Labs Business Development head Ryan Gentry told CoinDesk. “The primary users thus far have been a mix of power users and startups/businesses who are already running Lightning nodes.”      Since launch, Lightning Pool has facilitated over 11.5 BTC in orders (worth just over $208,000). According to data from a community-built Lightning Pool tweet bot, the service has several dozen active users (Lightning Labs declined to give an exact figure).      Lightning Pool provides a market where Lightning Network users can lease liquidity for payment channels, the transaction avenues Lightning uses to send faster and cheaper payments than Bitcoin’s main network.      Read more: What Is Bitcoin's Lightning Network?      Complex cryptography makes this possible, in addition to financial requirements that mandate payment channels must have enough bitcoin in reserve to “route” payments between network participants.    No more 'begging' for liquidity    If a Lightning user’s payment channel doesn’t have enough “inbound capacity” (the minimum bitcoin needed to receive a routed transaction), then he or she won’t be able to receive payments. Likewise, if a payment channel lacks enough “outbound capacity,” then it cannot send payments.      Lightning Pool was built to address such obstacles in Lightning’s financial plumbing. Through the service, Lightning Network users can lease liquidity from other Lightning users to access the liquidity necessary to route payments through the network.      Innovations like Bitrefill’s Thor channels, which allow customers to instant-purchase payment channels, have also taken aim at this problem. Before solutions like these, Lightning Network node operators had to do grassroots networking across messaging platforms and social media if they needed bitcoin in a pinch.      As one pseudonymous Lightning Network user, Openoms, expressed to CoinDesk, Pool is a breakthrough for the very purpose it serves in speeding up the liquidity-matching process.      “My relief is that begging on social media for incoming channels is over,” Openoms told CoinDesk over direct message.      Openoms has been testing Pool since before its public launch and is“very impressed,” adding the service is “an efficiency gain for allocating capital.” Lightning Labs also batches the transactions to fund the payment channels that are being leased, meaning Pool users can save money on fees by splitting them among multiple participants.      On the other side of the trade, the liquidity providers are earning passive yield on their bitcoin without having to relinquish their private keys. Gentry said the service has engendered a lot of excitement among community members as a new way to earn yield on their holdings (this adds to other non-custodial yielding options like earning fees from coin mixers).      Read more: Putting Pressure on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Vulnerabilities Will Strengthen It    Lightning Lab’s financial stack    Pool has been crowded mainly with individual users since shortly after launch, but Gentry thinks businesses will correct this balance over time as the service matures.      “We anticipate increased demand from businesses and enterprise users as Pool matures because they will likely have more consistent liquidity needs when using Lightning, or may want to enable their end users to earn returns on their funds,” he told CoinDesk.      Lightning Labs also uses the service because it does more than just generate fees for the company. Gentry said the service was “partly built … in order to solve an internal business problem,” namely, providing inbound channel liquidity for its Lightning Loop service. Loop allows its users to top off or withdraw from their Lightning balances without closing their payment channels.      As if illustrated by the fact that the two are anagrams, Pool and Loop are complementary services that address the same problem: Lightning’s need for constant, fresh liquidity.      Read more: Lightning Operators Are Bracing for a Bitcoin Bull Run      “The idea of Pool evolved, in part, to solve an internal business need – sourcing good inbound liquidity for Loop,” Gentry said. “But after speaking with customers and other Lightning services, we heard they were looking for a solution to the same problem, which was an encouraging sign in terms of the need for Pool.”      A Lightning optimist, Openoms is “bullish” on Pool and said it’s effective at “incentivizing people to place more capital on LN” and allocating it “strategically where it is needed.”      Right now, everything is run from the computer’s command line, so Openoms said that a GUI (or the visual interface that you use to interact with computer/web applications) will improve the user experience.      Gentry told CoinDesk a GUI for Pool is “in the works.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/19/lightning-networks-new-liquidity-marketplace-attracts-a-surprising-mix-of-individuals-enterprises,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b459ef0c240c0d4f26feecde4830a81da7c3b14-2400x1494.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Brian Brooks was an executive at Coinbase when he was tapped by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to be the number two at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the nation’s main bank regulator. Within two months he was acting Comptroller and now Brooks has been nominated for a full term.      In his short tenure, he has given banks the OK to provide custody of crypto and banking services to stablecoin issuers. In so doing, he has aroused the ire of congressional Democrats, who have accused him of acting too quickly and unilaterally on crypto.

42385148,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnPub,1605810668,Helium Wireless Network Approves New Hard Cap for HNT Token Emissions,"Helium is hard-capping production of the tokenized fuel that powers its decentralized wireless network.      Under a newly passed improvement proposal, Helium miners will stop adding to the circulating supply of HNT tokens at 223 million, a figure they will reach sometime in 2070 once bi-annual “halvenings,” also new to the network, have reduced new HNT monthly issuance to a negligible amount.      But that inflation hard cap does not mean an end to HNT mining. Miners will continue to mint HNT tokens even after they hit 223 million by replacing burned tokens. Project contributors say this will continue to incentivize mining even after inflation subsides.      Called “net emissions,” the unique twist is made possible by the nature of the Helium network. HNT tokens are essentially data credits for users. They spend and burn their HNT supplies to share data across Helium’s low-power alternative to WiFi and cellular networks. Newly minted tokens replace the ones removed through user activity.      The token currently has a $74.5 million market cap, according to CoinGecko.      Read more: Crypto-Powered IoT Networks Are on Their Way to Over 250 US Cities      HNT’s tokenomics had already accounted for gradual inflation – sort of. Project contributor James Fayal told CoinDesk the network previously issued 5 million tokens monthly using an equilibrium model meant to keep inflation in check.      But the coming changes will introduce a max supply that outside investors can more easily comprehend.      “Historically the biggest sort of question people have had about Helium tokenomics, people that are interested, they look at and go, ‘Oh, that’s really cool. You know, I don’t want to get involved with a token that has an infinite supply.’”      Introducing a hard cap conceptually similar to that of Bitcoin's is meant to make the system more understandable to the crypto community, Fayal added.      Helium intends to implement the new tokenomics in time for HNT’s first scheduled halvening in August 2021.      The project, backed by a Series C funding round of $15 million from the likes of Union Square Ventures and Multicoin Capital, currently has roughly 12,500 hotspots in the wild. A third-party manufacturing deal announced in September has seemingly boosted the reach of the network.      “The Helium Network is growing like a weed largely, in part, due to the new RAK miners, which slashed the cost to entry by 50% and made mining HNT a more attractive enterprise,” said Multicoin investor and Decentralized Wireless Alliance President Tushar Jain. “At the current pace, I expect there to be more than 20,000 hotspots deployed around the world by the end of the year.”",POSITIVE,HNT,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | HNT,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/19/helium-wireless-network-approves-new-hard-cap-for-hnt-token-emissions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54021e6268f235738bbad3fb8641c405c4a2fbb6-2048x1522.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A markets surveillance tool could meet the SEC's standards to allow a bitcoin ETF. A policy expert thinks existing financial precautions may be unfit for the rising world of DeFi.    Top shelf    Bitcoin ETF Solidus Labs has developed a market surveillance tool it says could become a cornerstone to a bitcoin ETF ... one day. For years, the SEC has rejected every bitcoin exchange-traded fund proposal it has seen due to concerns the market is too small to properly monitor, locking out a class of investors that primarily use traditional investment platforms. Solidus’ new tool hopes to solve this issue, by collecting data from a number of crypto service providers and acting as a sort of intermediary for the information, thereby presenting a more complete view of the bitcoin market.      Bitcoin > gold A Deutsche Bank analyst said customers increasingly prefer bitcoin over gold as a store-of-value investment. “There seems to be an increasing demand to use bitcoin where gold used to be used to hedge dollar risk, inflation, and other things,” said Jim Reid, managing director, head of global fundamental credit strategy, as quoted by ZeroHedge. Bitcoin is up 144% on the year, and gold 22%.      Cash adjacent A group of Japanese companies has said it will develop and test a private digital currency that would work alongside cash. Reuters reported Thursday that about 30 firms from sectors such as telecoms, utilities and retail will carry out the trials in 2021. The digital yen would be built on a common settlement platform and issued by banks during the trials, later possibly being issued by other entities. “We don’t want to create another silo-type platform. What we want to do is to create a framework that can make various platforms mutually compatible,” Hiromi Yamaoka, chair of the group and formerly an executive at the Bank of Japan, told Reuters.      FATF chance? The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) needs an entirely new approach when it comes to policing crypto, especially related to watchdog’s “Travel Rule” mandates, according to Senior Partner at XReg Consulting Sian Jones. Speaking at the second annual V20 Virtual Asset Service Providers Summit, Jones said, “The tried and tested methods work, after a fashion, in the traditional world of money. Arguably, they can be made to sort of fit the intermediated crypto world. They do not necessarily fit a DeFi world where they are not fit for purpose.” For FATF's side, a spokesperson said via email, "" the FATF is closely monitoring the sector to see the impact of the Standards and identify new and emerging risks and trends... releasing updated guidance on issues such as peer-to-peer transactions and unhosted wallets and will conduct a second review of the revised Standards by June 2021. As we have done throughout 2020, this will include consultation with a range of representatives from the virtual asset sector.”      Binance sues Binance has taken aim at Forbes Media, and two of its reporters, in court related to a story that claimed the crypto exchange giant is engaged in regulatory arbitrage. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey Wednesday, alleges harm against Binance by publishing a story last month that “contains numerous false, misleading and defamatory statements.” Notably, Binance refuted the veracity of a third-party document that served the basis of many of the article’s claims.

(The Block)  At stake    DeFi or bust With the meteoric rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) came a similar bump in the number of programmatic exploits. Year to date, the DeFi subsector has ballooned from under $1 billion in total value locked (TVL) to $13.7 billion, according to DeFi Pulse.      Much of this capital flowed into a handful of premier smart contracts, MakerDAO, Compound and Uniswap among the top. But it also went into smaller programs, with smaller teams.      Earlier this month, blockchain analytics firm CipherTrace found that nearly $100 million worth of crypto has been looted from a range of DeFi apps. In fact, these thefts account for nearly 40% of all crypto attacks across the entire industry.      In November alone, malicious attackers drained $2 million from Akropolis, $3.3 million from Cheese Bank, $6 million from Value Finance and $7 million from Origin Protocol.      Many of these attacks utilized a new financial technique called a flash loan, which allows users to take out uncollateralized loans from a decentralized program to leverage trades on another platform.      The frequency of flash loans in DeFi exploits have led some to believe this poorly understood tool to be the root of the issue, but now, industry experts are saying they are hardly to blame, CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports.      “While many are trying to frame this trend as the result of flash loans, most of these exploits could have been committed by any well-capitalized actor. All a flash loan does is temporarily make anyone a well-capitalized actor,” Chainlink co-founder Sergery Nazarov said.      The real issue lies with poorly constructed smart contracts. In particular, many smaller projects rely on “in-house pricing oracles” that can lead to a discrepancy between asset prices within a dapp and the greater market, opening the opportunity to arbitrage opportunities.      In the worst cases, attackers can engineer this arbitrage opportunity by using flash loans, but the issue still lies with how a program deals with real-world, time-sensitive information.      This is important, especially as U.S., European and international watchdogs begin to notice DeFi. Including the amount of attacks, fraud and manipulation.      “When you are running [Defi] things on code and you are putting it out in the wild you are missing a step and you may want to test the code, audit the code, you may want to have some peer review of the code; to send it out live right away without those protections is risky those, the SEC’s Crypto Czar Valerie Szczepanik said at the Sept. 18 Parallel Summit.      As several instances have shown, audits are not enough to prevent these attacks, Quantstamp CEO Richard Ma told Foxley. “Understanding the products and the business logic is much more time-consuming and important than a straight-up code review,” Ma said.      Insurance is one potential fail-safe. But it will come down to teams building redundancies, checking and rechecking code, anticipating loopholes and securing their platforms.      Or else, as CipherTrace said in its report, “it is likely that DeFi will only continue to suffer from the consequences resulting from inadequate [anti money laundering protections] and security.”    Who won #CryptoTwitter?

42385198,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnQ7B,1605809117,Open Finance Is Better Than Broken Finance,"As much as the global economy continues to grow, we are leaving billions of people behind who don't have bank accounts, a reality that is exacerbated by the economic impacts of the coronavirus. Without a bank account, a person can't get a loan, invest or earn interest on savings. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, confronts this problem head-on by democratizing access to financial services.      Anyone with an internet connection can deposit digital assets into DeFi protocols and start earning interest as passive income. They can put up their digital assets as collateral to acquire a loan. They can earn passive income by yield farming or by adding their digital assets to liquidity pools and collecting fees on trades.      Making these types of wealth generation opportunities available to everyone, including people in developing regions, is what will eventually close financial inclusion gaps, help people out of poverty and transform global monetary systems for the better.    Gregory Keough is the founder of the DMM Foundation, the organization behind the DeFi Money Market (DMM).    While not a panacea – DeFi is still an immature industry with capital and human risks – it presents a ramp into a financial system where people can put their money to work.      Over time, we've seen economic uncertainty spur interest in cryptocurrencies. Adoption of bitcoin increased in Venezuela amid hyperinflation, for example. Additionally, the Bitcoin white paper was released in response to the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis. We are in the midst of another period of economic uncertainty today, and are seeing surging bitcoin prices and skyrocketing participation in DeFi.      As the United Nations Secretary-General (UNSG) António Guterres expressed in a recent speech, “We are experiencing the sharpest decline in per capita income since 1870."" With 70 million to 100 million people at risk of being pushed into extreme poverty, the World Economic Forum (WEF) is rightly focusing on financial inclusion initiatives. Patrick Njorge, governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, conveyed in a WEF article that digital financial services have been invaluable to helping keep people out of poverty throughout the [COVID-19] pandemic by ""enabling people to pay for goods and services, receive compensation for their work, access social-assistance payments and secure financial support, such as bank loans, for their distressed businesses.""      See also: Banking the Unbanked: How the Crypto Community Can Make a Big Impact      As advantageous as such digital financial services have been, however, they rely on a broken financial system and fail to address the core issues that are keeping billions of people from participating in the global economy.    How DeFi takes finance to the next level    DeFi's ability to improve access to financial services, regardless of whether or not peopple hold a bank account, creates an entirely new framework for finance that is ultimately better for people.      First, DeFi systems allow anyone to get a loan. Lending and borrowing is key to business growth and entrepreneurship, and without loans many people cannot gain the financing they need to jump-start businesses or advance their livelihoods in terms of career, education and family growth.      In the midst of the coronavirus recession, it's that much more essential for entrepreneurs to gain access to capital, as small and medium businesses will be the primary job creators worldwide. When people have jobs, they purchase goods and services – actions that propel the economy.      See also: Frances Coppola – Why Bitcoin Thrives (and Why It Won’t Replace the Dollar)      Secondly, DeFi confronts the issue of currency debasement that has plagued traditional monetary systems since the abandonment of the gold standard. Given the lack of asset backing or a value peg, fiat currency inevitably experiences inflation. This means the dollar, euro or yuan a person earns today will be worth less tomorrow.      Such a system is not conducive to business or personal financial growth. DeFi operates outside any government or central bank and so does not experience the same debasement as fiat instruments. DeFi protocols that allow for the generation of positive, stable yield are bringing earned interest back into the global monetary financial system.    As usability improves and more people become aware of DeFi services, participation gaps will diminish.    Furthermore, DeFi offers more privacy, resistance to financial censorship as well as much-needed transparency and accountability into financial systems. Given all code is public and available for anyone to review, DeFi ameliorates concerns of corruption and theft that flourish when transparency is lacking.      Though thefts do occur on DeFi protocols, these hacks are generally due to negligence on the part of the protocol creators in conducting security audits. If there is a vulnerability in the code, bad actors will exploit it, hence a need for thorough smart contract auditing prior to launch.    What's next for DeFi?    Given how revolutionary DeFi is, it's natural to wonder why everyone isn't already using it. For one, DeFi protocols have a way to go before ease of use is on par with online trading platforms like Robinhood or payment apps like Venmo. Admittedly, getting a loan using your digital assets as collateral is not yet as simple as making a purchase from Amazon.com.      The ease-of-use hurdle is contributing to a lack of diversity in the DeFi user base that protocols should seek to address. According to a CoinGecko survey, DeFi users are dominated by males between the ages of 20-40 years old. As usability improves and more people become aware of DeFi services, these participation gaps will diminish.

42385169,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnQCD,1605806616,Bitcoin Options Investors Are Starting to Hedge Against Potential Price Pullback,"Bitcoin's options market data shows investors are beginning to position for a temporary retreat from the cryptocurrency's steep bull run.      The one-month implied volatility, which is influenced by the demand for call and put options, jumped from roughly 55% to a four-month high of 70.5% in the past two days, suggesting increased expectations for price turbulence over the next four weeks.      The one-month gauge is currently seen at 65%. Implied volatility metrics for longer durations have also recovered from recent lows.      Alongside that, the negative spread between the cost of puts (bearish bets) and calls (bullish bets) has eased, as evidenced by the recovery in the one-, three- and six-month put-call skews. Notably, the one-month gauge bounced from -27% to -14%, according to data source Skew.      These numbers indicate increased demand for put options – a sign of investors hedging against a potential price pullback. While call buying can and does cause a rise in implied volatility metrics, in this case, the put-call skew has recovered alongside the pick up in volatility, suggesting a rise in demand for puts.      Validating that assessment is the tweet by Deribit Insights, which says institutions have bought put options. That does not necessarily imply a bearish bias but could be a hedging strategy against a long or bullish position in the spot market.      Read more: Bitcoin Indicator Suggests Bull Market Is Still in Early Phase      Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, and the put option represents the right to sell. Implied volatility, a key component in calculating the price of an option, is the expected standard deviation of returns over a selected period and is expressed in annualized terms.      Fears of a deeper drawdown in bitcoin's price and demand for puts looks to have been fueled by the volatile price action seen in the past 36 hours. Bitcoin rose as high as $18,358 during Wednesday's Asian trading hours only to make a quick retreat to $17,200. That has seen volatility spike and the put-call skew rise, as traders hedge their bullish sentiment with puts, according to Shaun Fernando, head of risk and product at cryptocurrency exchange Deribit.      The renewed interest in the put options comes following bitcoin's recent vertical rally from $10,000 to above $18,000. The cryptocurrency has seen multiple corrections of more than 20% in the previous bull markets. This time, a bull market correction has remained elusive, possibly due to a supply deficit in the market.      However, the uptrend may now lose some momentum, according to technical studies.      Both the long upper wick attached to Wednesday's indecisive candle and the above-50 reading on the relative strength index indicate bull fatigue. ""The cryptocurrency may face some selling pressure if the prices end (UTC) Thursday below lows near $17,100 seen Wednesday,"" Patrick Heusser, a senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, told CoinDesk.      The broader trend remains constructive with the three- and six-month put-call skews reporting negative values and macro factors aligned in favor of scarce assets like bitcoin.

42385154,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnPqp,1605806072,SEC Grants Digital Avatar Firm IMVU Permission to Sell Crypto Tokens,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has granted another crypto firm permission to sell its native cryptocurrency.      The SEC published a “no-action letter” on Thursday (dated Nov. 17) to IMVU, a digital avatar company, allowing the firm to sell its VCOIN digital tokens to users, albeit with strict restrictions on how these tokens can be sold.      The securities regulator has granted just a handful of other such letters, including to Turnkey Jets and Pocketful of Quarters, making the latest action somewhat notable despite the token’s relative obscurity. In a first, the SEC is allowing IMVU to sell tokens designed to be converted back to fiat by users. (In its previous rulings, the SEC said users could not buy, sell or trade either Quarters or Turnkey tokens.)      “Based on the facts presented, the Division will not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if, in reliance on your opinion as counsel that VCOIN is not a security, IMVU offers and sells VCOIN, which is transferable both on and off of IMVU’s platform, without registration under Section 5 of the Securities Act and does not register VCOIN as a class of equity securities under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act,” wrote Jonathan Ingram, a legal adviser to the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance.      VCOIN is specifically built on Ethereum, and can be used as a royalty system for creators, allowing users to be compensated for providing services.      According to the SEC’s letter, IMVU can only sell tokens at a fixed price; buyers must agree to purchase tokens to use and not to speculate on price; and proceeds cannot be used to build the VCOIN network. Users must also comply with a number of know-your-customer and anti-money laundering restrictions, the SEC said.      In the request for a no-action letter, IMVU attorney Michael Didiuk, a partner at the law firm Perkins Coie, wrote that users cannot convert VCOIN into fiat currencies on its own platform, though they would have to pay a 10%-15% fee if they convert on a different platform.    See also: SEC Chairman Jay Clayton Stepping Down at End of Year    IMVU intends to dissuade potential speculative actions by preventing users from “obtaining more VCOIN than they could realistically use” or purchase enough tokens to “realize meaningful profits,” the request said.      Users will also be restricted from transferring too many tokens off of IMVU’s platform, and must abide by a holding period of up to 45 days before they can conduct any off-platform transfers, according to the letter.      “Taken together, these [p]latform controls should eliminate any reasonable incentive to pursue arbitrage profits from a differential between IMVU’s fixed VCOIN price and an offPlatform VCOIN price,” Didiuk wrote.      IMVU filed to trademark “VCOIN” in August 2019, according to Justia. The filing says the trademark will apply to “downloadable virtual goods,” including digital tokens that use blockchain “to execute and record transactions,” meaning a cryptocurrency.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/19/sec-grants-digital-avatar-firm-imvu-permission-to-sell-crypto-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01e4f8b8a9613ff360c98032e1dae3140eeb8c80-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitmain’s Antpool backed the protocol upgrade Thursday morning in a message sent to Poolin, the pool told CoinDesk, joining five other pools in Poolin’s Taproot Activation initiative and pushing the percentage of hashrate in support of the upgrade over 50%. Antpool plans to publicly express its support in a forthcoming block's coinbase.      Poolin’s vice president, Alejandro De La Torre, told CoinDesk he is “beyond happy” that most major mining pools have responded affirmatively to their “consensus-built effort” to support Taproot.      Notably, Binance Pool is the only top-five pool to not yet support Taproot.      Taproot aims to improve transaction privacy and enhance Bitcoin’s smart contract functionality. As an added bonus, it’s also designed to keep Bitcoin’s blocks small, with block space as accessible as possible.      “The only uncertainty with Taproot is when and how it will be activated,” said Daniel Frumkin, engineer and technical writer at Slush Pool, in a direct message with CoinDesk.      “In the end it should be a straightforward process with minimal drama,” he added, noting that Taproot is “not controversial.” Frumkin contrasted this proposed upgrade with the heated industry-wide disagreements caused by the 2017 SegWit2X proposal, which many miners also supported.      Seeing any miners opposing the Taproot upgrade would be a shock to Frumkin. “I'd expect the rest of the major pools to signal support in the following weeks,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | BNB | FORKS,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/19/majority-of-bitcoin-hashrate-signals-support-for-taproot-scaling-privacy-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c667ef65c3eadafc0060f2b92809b70f9d61137d-707x498.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42385172,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnQDT,1605803671,First Mover: What China Crackdown Means for $18K Bitcoin as Dimon Passes on 'Tea',"Bitcoin was flat to slightly lower after briefly climbing Wednesday above $18,000 for the first time since December 2017.      ""There is a tsunami of buying power up against reluctant sellers,"" Charlie Morris, CEO of the cryptocurrency fund manager ByteTree, wrote in a note to clients. ""These buyers are putting real money behind bitcoin, not the old dribs and drabs normally seen from retail investors.""      In traditional markets, European shares fell and U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open amid concerns over new coronavirus-related restrictions and lockdowns. Gold weakened 0.5% to $1,863 an ounce.    Market moves    Bitcoin’s breathtaking rally for the past couple of months has been attributed to all sorts of grand macroeconomic reasons, from the need for a safe haven as the pandemic ravages the global economy once more to marvelous projections about the future role of the cryptocurrency in finance.      Yet, what if the recent run-up was merely the result of miners in China having a hard time finding a place to sell their inventory for the kind of hard cash they need to pay the bills? In other words, fewer new bitcoin may be hitting the market and that’s what’s driving prices higher. That’s an explanation explored in Omkar Godbole’s article on CoinDesk Wednesday.      According to recent note from QCP Capital on its Telegram channel, miners in China are seeing their bank accounts and credit cards frozen as the government tries to crack down on money laundering. That’s a big deal for bitcoin because 70% of its mining power comes from China.      In the process, the government’s squeeze is also affecting a lot of cryptocurrency exchanges catering to Chinese customers, most notably OKEx and Huobi; some questions have been raised about what happened to a couple of executives at such firms, as CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported last week. OKEx suspended withdrawals on Oct. 16 when founder Mingxing ""Star"" Xu was rumored to have been taken into police custody. It announced Thursday that it ""will be resuming withdrawals"" on or before Nov. 27 as Xu is now said to be a free man again.      Over the summer, OTC traders in China also felt the heat, and they had a hard time getting access to cash as well.      For all the talk about how bitcoin is the future staring us right in the face with no social distancing or mask, utilities companies, landlords and maintenance employees still need to be paid in fiat. Their bills aren’t denominated in satoshis but in yuan. Thus, there’s always a need for miners to trade into local currency and get on with whatever they do in their lives because many public service providers in China don’t exactly accept tether. According to QCP Capital, a survey done by Colin Wu showed that 74% of miners claim they have trouble selling their inventory to cover operating expenses.      To be sure, Wu’s survey may not have been conducted with the most rigid of standards. And the calendar still insists that this year is 2020. If there’s one thing this year has taught the world it’s that surveys should be taken with a great of salt. Nonetheless, it’s a data point.      Bitcoin’s gains since the start of October have been nothing short of phenomenal. Its price is up about 65% since the start of last month. Over the past few weeks, some of China’s biggest exchanges started seeing accounts frozen and executives all of a sudden, er, out of the office at the moment.      Coincidence? Maybe.      Meanwhile, volume on bitcoin has been healthy, with $1.6 billion traded Wednesday on some of the major exchanges, as CoinDesk’s Daniel Cawrey reported. Open interest in bitcoin options have shot up to a record high of over $4 billion, double what it was in mid-October. What’s more, positions in the options market are as bullish as they have ever been.      About 900 bitcoin are mined every day. At current prices, that’s worth just $16 million. However, in a month it adds up to nearly $500 million, and the lion’s share of that is from China.      This is an interesting case where the supply curve may be shifting inward just as the demand curve is shifting outward. Either one of those would, all things being equal, raise prices. And while we may now be witnessing both, it’s good to remember that a sudden return to the previous condition for either one of those curves could drop prices as fast as it raised them.      – Lawrence Lewitinn    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin is taking a breather, having chalked out a steep rally to three-year highs above $18,000 in the past six weeks.      At press time, bitcoin is trading near $17,700, having faced rejection above $18,000 multiple times in the past 24 hours. Some investors are beginning to position for a deeper pullback with the cryptocurrency struggling to establish a foothold above $18,000.      The one-month implied volatility, which is mainly determined by the demand for call and put options, jumped from roughly 55% to a four-month high of 70.5% in the past two days, suggesting increased expectations for price turbulence over the next four weeks.      Alongside that, the spread between the cost of puts, or bearish bets, and calls eased, as evidenced by the recovery in the one-, three-, and six-month put-call skews. Notably, the one-month gauge bounced from -27% to 14%, according to data source Skew.      The numbers indicate increased demand for put options - a sign of investors hedging against a potential price pullback.      – Omkar Godbole    What's hot  JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said blockchain will have a pivotal role in the future of finance even if bitcoin, the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization that made blockchain famous, is not his “cup of tea.” (CoinDesk)  Bitcoin’s price surge may be driven as much by a drying up in supply as by an increase in demand.

Speaking on CNBC, Clayton, who's stepping down at the end of the year, said: ""What we are seeing is that our current payment mechanisms domestically and internationally have inefficiencies. Those inefficiencies are the things that are driving the rise of bitcoin.""  Bitcoin was trading a tick below $18,000 at press time Thursday as the bull run continues to drive the cryptocurrency near all-time highs.  Clayton rebutted interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin's suggestion that bitcoin could ever be regulated as a security. Bitcoin ""was much more a payment mechanism and stored value"" than a security, he said.  That doesn't mean the SEC is comfortable with the crypto quite yet. Under Clayton, the SEC has repeatedly blocked a number of potential bitcoin exchange-traded funds from launching.  Clayton nevertheless seemed to echo JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's Wednesday prediction that regulators would eventually come knocking as bitcoin continues to grow.

Born out of the Concourse Open Community, the same group that created decentralized finance (DeFi) rankings board DeFi Pulse, Slingshot aims to help users find the best price for any given token trade on Ethereum.      That said, this space has grown quite crowded, with similar solutions such as 1inch, ParaSwap, 0x’s Matcha and even the prominent Ethereum wallet MetaMask.      The round was led by Framework Ventures, with additional participation from many others, including Electric Capital, IDEO CoLab, Coinbase Ventures, Winklevoss Capital, Digital Currency Group, Robot Ventures and more.      Read more: Why the Days of Centralized Exchanges Are Numbered      The dream of making trades without turning over custody of crypto assets to a third party has been a longstanding aim for the industry. DEXs struggled for a long time to compete with centralized competitors, but that’s starting to turn around. For example, one of the leaders, Uniswap, is actually doing more volume than Coinbase by some metrics.      DEX aggregators offer the insight that once users can trade straight from their wallets, they have no reason to look at trades on one exchange. Traders might as well look at all the DEXs for every trade.      “The open and permissionless nature of DeFi brings a generational platform shift that presents a new paradigm in financial services, unifying diverse global communities and allowing them to participate in emerging economies or create their own without the need to ask for permission,” Slingshot’s CEO, Clinton Bembry, said in a press release.      Slingshot was first built at a hackathon in 2018 and has seen over $100 million in volume so far, according to the company.      “Slingshot’s best-in-class DEX aggregator is built to provide the seamless user experience, low latency and inexpensive transactions that DeFi users deserve,” Framework Ventures co-founder Vance Spencer said in a press release.",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TRADING | ZRX,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/19/dex-aggregator-rebrands-to-slingshot-after-raising-31m-from-coinbase-ventures-others,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2029e61f15d398eb8e0d1754a94333b73672a719-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It will therefore allow ""unrestricted withdrawals"" by Nov. 27.  Before then, the exchange will carry out security checks to ensure normal operations of its hot wallets and safe transfers of funds.  This may suggest OKEx is expecting a flood of withdrawals when the service resumes.

Conor Freeman, 21, was handed down a two-year and 11-month sentence in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on Tuesday. He had pleaded guilty to several charges involving ""guile and deception,"" according to Judge Martin Nolan.      As reported by The Irish Times, Freeman was found guilty of engaging in the possession of proceeds of crime, theft and dishonestly operating a computer. He had 142.7 bitcoin in his possession when arrested, an amount worth $2,502,790 at time of writing.      Freeman had not operated alone in his criminal activity, despite being characterized by his legal counsel as ""very much a loner"" in his younger years. He had been part of a group of six men who hacked cryptocurrency accounts over a three-day period in May, 2018.      The group identified three potential victims on social media where they obtained email addresses and phone numbers. Contacts within mobile operators would then transfer each victim's phone number onto a SIM card purchased by the group.      In turn, the crew used methods for recovering passwords on various platforms and them sent to the victim's phone number which was now in their possession.      The victims, Darran Marble, Seth Sharpiro and Micheal Templeman, respectively lost $100,000, over $1.9 million and more than $167,000 in cryptocurrency.      See also: Alleged Promoter of BitConnect Crypto Scam Charged in Australia      Freeman had been responsible for sifting through victims' emails to identify cryptocurrency accounts.      The proceeds of the hacks were split among the group. When Freeman was finally caught by the Gardai, Ireland's national police force, he had already spent €130,000 (US$153,996) of the proceeds.      Following his arrest, Freeman handed police an electronic wallet containing the remaining bitcoin he had acquired from victims as well as the access keys – ""exceptional"" assistance that was noted in court.

""There seems to be an increasing demand to use bitcoin where gold used to be used to hedge dollar risk, inflation, and other things,"" Jim Reid, managing director, head of global fundamental credit strategy, said, according to ZeroHedge.      Bitcoin has long been considered by supporters as digital gold due to its limited, predictable supply and use case as a store of value outside banking influence.      While bitcoin has gained 144% this year, gold is up 22%. Both assets seem to have benefitted from the inflation-boosting monetary and fiscal policies launched by central banks and governments across the globe to contain the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.      The cryptocurrency has rallied over 25% this month alone despite hopes for a swift global economic recovery on potential coronavirus vaccines and improved risk appetite in stock markets. Gold, however, has lived up to its reputation as a haven asset by falling 1% so far this month.      Also read: Gold Lags Far Behind Bitcoin as Vaccine Optimism Buoys Markets      The divergence between gold and silver on the one hand, and bitcoin on the other, is one of the oddities of this month, according to Reid. U.S.-based drug makers Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA) announced encouraging results for their experimental coronavirus vaccines earlier this month, triggering a rotation of money out of gold and other haven assets and into risk assets.      Reid told Bloomberg earlier this month that coronavirus vaccines are equivalent to global fiscal stimulus. Christian Nolting, global chief investment officer at Deutsche Bank Wealth Management, said inflation could rise moderately in 2021 and 2022, boding well for stocks and gold.

42387605,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQlnxf,1605773426,Solidus Labs Believes Its Crypto Surveillance Tool Can Help Launch a Bitcoin ETF,"Market manipulation is one of the main concerns the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cited in rejecting a number of bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications. Solidus Labs, a technology firm, believes it has developed a technical surveillance solution to address this issue.  Solidus announced Wednesday it was rolling out a market surveillance tool to monitor crypto exchange transaction data and flag potential manipulation across different platforms, as part of an effort to address ongoing regulatory concerns about crypto markets.  “These are issues that have been largely resolved in traditional markets through market surveillance systems [that] were designed for traditional markets,” said Solidus Labs Chief Operating Officer Chen Arad.  Proponents say an ETF would make bitcoin accessible to a wider swath of retail investors by offering a regulated product that would be available on major investment platforms, such as Charles Schwab or TD Ameritrade.  However, a number of ETF applications have been rejected by the SEC, which has said the bitcoin market isn’t large enough to properly surveil. Chairman Jay Clayton, who will leave the role at the end of the year, has said in the past that a bitcoin ETF couldn’t be approved until the agency is confident the market was free from manipulation. One example of manipulation is wash trading, when a few accounts trade back and forth to make volume appear higher than it is using bots.  In 2019, the agency rejected Bitwise’s effort, saying there needed to be a surveillance-sharing agreement between an exchange and a market of “significant” size as one potential example of how to address this concern.  How it works  Solidus’ tool has four parts: data collection, data storage, data processing and reporting, Arad said.  The program collects data from a number of parties conducting transactions, mainly exchanges, acting as a sort of intermediary for the information. This ensures that exchanges aren’t required to share potentially proprietary trading data with each other, Arad said.  “The first part is being able to collect the data in a fully anonymized, obfuscated and encrypted way, and assembling it … in a multi-tenant database,” he said.  Solidus’ system then processes the information, comparing buy and sell data to look for potential wash trading or other forms of market manipulation.  See also: Prime Broker Bequant Adds Risk-Monitoring Service in Push for Added Compliance  Part of this processing includes comparing market information from accounts on one exchange to its “neighbors,” meaning accounts with similar attributes, said Solidus CEO Asaf Meir.  Neighbors are effectively a way of creating different types of broad profiles, which in turn act as a sort of average baseline for comparing account activity, if a user’s behavior diverges from the norm.  Solidus looks at an exchange’s reporting requirements, what alerts should be reported and which parties might be involved before sending these alerts to its clients.  “This type of data is extremely sensitive and confidential, and by the way that's also how generally our product works, right, our product works off of private data that exchanges, broker dealers, regulators provide us with,” Meir said.  More broadly, this same technology can be used in different jurisdictions, potentially acting as a sort of global standard, similar to the Financial Action Task Force travel rule, Arad noted.  In use  Solidus is in discussions with a number of crypto exchanges and regulatory agencies to begin operating its surveillance tool in the U.S., though Arad and Meir declined to identify potential clients on the record, citing ongoing discussions.  Chris Land, general counsel at the Wyoming Division of Banking, said his agency is one of the regulators working with Solidus and evaluating its solution.  The company has already helped contribute to a section on market manipulation in an upcoming manual the division plans to publish, he said.  See also: Goldman Sachs Veterans Raise $3 Million to Fight Crypto Manipulation  The tool is already in use with some other, non-U.S. clients, Arad said, adding that it had been developed specifically to address regulatory concerns.  “We were working with specific exchanges in a particular jurisdiction where they were required to apply for licensing. In that process we also started working with the regulator, and we generally developed the product with regulators,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/11/19/solidus-labs-believes-its-crypto-surveillance-tool-can-help-launch-a-bitcoin-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0e8ec3af89ce15f01d8ed0ef4d198012d7dfbc8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
