42376507,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AqPP,1370971922,How to choose a bitcoin exchange,"Although there is no lack of Bitcoin exchanges available for people who want to invest or trade in BTC, there are a few things you should know before you get started. Transferring your money over to an exchange can be an arduous process at times. Hopefully, it will get easier in the future, but right now it takes a certain degree of thought and planning.  Bitcoins are not easy for people to acquire. If you’re able to objectively evaluate a few things before deciding on one, you might be better off than choosing the exchange that has the best-looking website.  Let's cycle through some of the characteristics you need to consider when choosing an exchange.  Liquidity  Because Bitcoin is traded on a market where people are both looking to purchase or sell the currency, it’s important to take into account the amount of liquidity that an exchange has. Liquidity is the ability to sell without the price being significantly affected, causing the price to drop. The more buyers and sellers there are, the more liquidity that exists. So, what method can you use to tell how much liquidity an exchange has? One word: volume. Take a look at the top exchanges by trading volume as calculated by Bitcoincharts.  Exchange30 Day VolumemtgoxUSD1,209,589bitstampUSD257,123mtgoxEUR149,444btceUSD143,780btcnCNY118,710  Those 30 day numbers represent the total number of Bitcoins that have been traded on each exchange. And while Mt. Gox has had its share of problems, many of them can be attributed to its own growing pains. Mt.Gox is by far the largest exchange and it very often offers the highest selling price for Bitcoins. This creates a network effect that allows them to become larger and larger as more people join that exchange.  Fees    The process of buying and selling Bitcoins costs money – that’s the incentive for exchanges to be run as businesses. However, unlike buying a stock or bond, Bitcoin exchanges are in the practice of charging a percentage. This is in contrast to discount brokerages commonly used by investors in the US that charge a flat rate fee. Because of the percentage model, buying and selling Bitcoins over time can get very expensive.    Fee %30 days USD volume0.50%< $5000.48%< $1,0000.46%< $2,0000.44%< $4,0000.42%< $6,5000.40%< $10,0000.38%< $15,0000.36%< $20,0000.34%< $25,0000.32%< $37,5000.30%< $50,0000.28%< $62,5000.26%< $75,0000.24%< $100,0000.22%< $150,0000.20%> $150,000  Source: Bitstamp’s fees section on its website.  This fee schedule from Bitstamp is a common structure for Bitcoin exchanges. They will often charge a higher percentage fee on a sliding scale that is based on volume. The more volume that you trade per a thirty day period, the less percentage that the exchange charges. This can be challenging for conducting many transactions since one would need to calculate percentages constantly to factor in the mathematics of trades. But the exchanges make a lot of money this way, and until an exchange with high volume starts charging flat-rate commissions – a kind of “discount Bitcoin brokerage” – this is the way that things will be.  Proximity    Bitcoin is still a relatively unregulated currency, but that is going to change over the long run. As there is more exposure in the media and financial industries regarding Bitcoin, governments will inevitably want to exert a degree of control over it as a transmission of monetary value. This is because they want to ensure that it does not become an instrument for illegal activities. Money laundering, terrorism and illegal drug smuggling are a few of the reasons why authorities have interest in monitoring Bitcoins.      Top Exchanges by Volume and Their Location    ExchangeCountryMt. GoxJapanBitstampUnited KingdomBTC-ERussiaBTCChinaChinaBitcoin.deGermany    Because of this, it is important to consider the geographic location of a Bitcoin exchange before you choose one. The location that the exchange decides to do business in will dictate what laws it will have to comply with. Most countries have not even issued guidance on Bitcoin activities like the United States’ Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has, but if and when many of them start to do it, it could affect your ability to transact in Bitcoins. If you have familiarity with a particular country’s financial laws and regulations, you should probably pick an exchange that does business there.    Accessibility    An unfortunate reality for Bitcoin at present day is the risk of exchanges being attacked. The purpose of doing this is to change the perception of Bitcoins in order to profit from price swings. Bitcoin is volatile, and an attack that causes the price to drop is something that malicious hackers can profit from. This has affected the top exchange, Mt. Gox, significantly this year to the point that in April they released specific information about what they are experiencing.      One tool that can be used to measure a site’s accessibility is something called host-tracker. Simply enter in the exchange URL you wish to check, and the tool will try to access it from different hosting partners around the world. You can even set up email or SMS alerts that will allow you to track a site’s uptime over a period of time. Accessibility to an exchange is obviously important; you have to factor in an exchange’s risk of being attacked for monetary reasons in your decisions to choose one.      If you’ve made the decision to purchase Bitcoins, you also have to make a choice about which exchange to use. This is something that should be done with some considerations in mind. Not all exchanges are made equal, and everyone has a special set of circumstances. Because of this, it is important to think about liquidity, fees, proximity and accessibility as well as your own personal situation when choosing an exchange.      Tell us in the comments what you think. What is the most important aspect of a Bitcoin exchange that makes you decide to use it over others? What can Bitcoin exchanges do better?",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/11/how-to-choose-a-bitcoin-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/76b74b681c7e7ea05e97152fbaa08b9eeb420b8b-603x403.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376531,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AqHr,1370966919,Fertility doc helps couple conceive first-ever 'Bitcoin baby',"How gung-ho a Bitcoiner is Dr. C. Terence Lee? He's such a big believer in the digital currency that he was willing to endure some strange looks from patients -- and part with 50 percent of his usual fees -- to enable a milestone in the Bitcoin economy: the first baby born following fertility treatments paid for with cryptocurrency.  Lee, medical director of the California-based Fertility Care of Orange County, discovered Bitcoin around a year ago and found the community's enthusiasm appealing. It wasn't long before he was looking for ways to use it in his own practice. He began making an offer to some of his patients: if they paid with bitcoins, he would offer them a steep discount for their treatment.  The offer didn't always go over smoothly, as Lee told CNN:  ""In some cases they reacted like I said I wanted to be paid in vials of crack cocaine,"" he recalls.  Despite such reactions -- and the lack of response to the clinic door sign stating his practice accepts bitcoins -- Lee pressed on. He eventually found two willing candidates in the form of a couple he'd helped with three previous babies.  A bit of Bitcoin wrangling and nine months later, and the couple had Baby Number Four ... a healthy baby girl.  Lee described the whole experience at last month's Bitcoin 2013 conference in San Jose. He's also made a point of expressing his gratitude to the family of the baby for agreeing to an arrangement that's put them in an unusual spotlight.  Just this week, in fact, Lee created a Bitcoin address to collect donations for the family: 1GiXrbFGFGSY8wQ1zDbArJnbgJZJVFNKdW.  ""This couple donated their privacy to allow permission to publicly show this photo of their baby,"" Lee posted on reddit. ""They asked nothing for it in return, but said if it will help people, then they would be glad to do it. Assisting in the spread of BTC adoption and empowering the common person to transact freely certainly counts as helping people.""  While setting up a trust fund for the baby, as one redditor suggested, would be ""awesome,"" Lee stated, a simple gift card -- purchased with bitcoins, of course -- would be a nice gesture. He's even provided a link to Blockchain.info so donors could track fund-raising progress.  As of today, the blockchain showed 10 transactions on behalf of the couple, with a total of 1.195 bitcoins (around $128.00) raised so far.  In addition to receiving support for the couple, Lee is also finding new-found interest in Bitcoin among his patients since the CNN story was published.  ""As you know, the first few BTC cases were ones where extra labor was necessary on the part of the business to make the transaction happen the way it did,"" Lee told CoinDesk in an email. ""Since then, there have been at least two spontaneous unsolicited inquiries about paying with BTC from my current patients as well as two inquiries from potential new patients.""  Lee continues to evangelize for Bitcoin in other ways as well, even bringing up the topic with fellow physicians occasionally. None so far has adopted it professionally, he noted, but ""some are interested in knowing about BTC for personal reasons.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/11/fertility-doc-helps-couple-conceive-first-ever-bitcoin-baby,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c04394ed48778cb42b17f7dad907564197394c5-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376522,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Aqbz,1370962801,8 Bitcoin trading personalities: Which one are you?,"For the past couple of weeks, bitcoin's value has been dropping steadily from a high of $130 to below $100. (It was back up to $105.51 as of early morning Tuesday, EST.) For a fairly young commodity that's still finding its way into the marketplace, that's not necessarily surprising.  However, the fact that bitcoin's value had for some time held so steadily to a range between $115 and $125 caused a lot of people to get a bit panicky. Adding to the jitters have been concerns over the Liberty Reserve shutdown, speculation about possible government restrictions on bitcoin exchanges and other rumors du jour.  Things really hit the fan on Sunday, June 9, when Bitcoin experienced a flash crash. The price of BTC plummeted from $110 to around $93. The internet was alive with chatter about possible causes – everything from unfounded scare emails about the Mt. Gox exchange to government conspiracy theories. In the end, of course, it turned out to be much ado about nothing.  No market is immune to this type of rapid fluctuation ... because the markets might change, but people don't. Human behavior tends to fall within a few particular categories, as we can see from these eight most common personality types found in trading.  The Bandwagoner -- This is a person tends to go with the flow ... and not just in the marketplace. (You can see this type of behavior in many other settings.) Bandwagoners are individuals who make decisions due to the expectations of the people surrounding them. (And, admit it, most of us have done this at one time or another.) When the majority of people are acting a certain way, this individual will follow despite any personal beliefs he or she might have. These are the folks who buy something not because they need it, but simply because it's trendy. In a market like Bitcoin, these people's actions can have a lot of consequences. When they follow the majority based on unconfirmed information, prices can yo-yo sharply up or down.  The Herd Member -- Picture a herd of cattle just standing around, chilling in the middle of a field, when all of a sudden one cow hears something off in the distance and freaks out. By worrying and snorting and bellowing and kicking the dirt, that cow freaks out two or three others nearby. Before you know it, the entire herd is out of control and stampeding toward ... who knows? This response is similar to the bandwagon effect. However, in this case, individuals end up acting as a group without any plans or direction. You'll see this behavior a lot during market crashes and market bubbles.  Mr./Ms. Loss Aversion -- This is the kind of trader who would rather cut his or her losses and get out while the getting is good. These types of investors often sell their assets even when the price has increased, and will hold onto something that has decreased in value.  John/Jill One-Note -- Sometimes, when there isn't a lot of information available, people will latch onto whatever small bit of intelligence they can find and use that as their guide, even if the information is of small significance. For example, if the value of Bitcoin is going down, this kind of investor might hear one piece of positive information – however ephemeral – and base all of his or her decisions on that, believing the price will eventually change direction and allow them to profit.  The Biased Optimist -- This kind of investor tends to think everything is awesome all the time: the glass is always half full. These folks often overestimate the likelihood of positive events. The problem is, they're so optimistic, they tend to underestimate the possibility of any negative consequences.  The Ostrich -- The Ostrich believes that, if you bury your head in the sand, no one can see you, right? Basically, this behavior is just plain denial. Investors with very little experience often fall into this kind of behavior, denying negative situations. They can become so focused on their goals of making money that they do not accept the very real existence of current or future downsides.  Mr./Ms. Overconfident -- When everything is up, then it will just plain continue to go up no matter what. This is the thinking of the overconfident. Confidence isn't necessarily a bad thing -- we all need it in the right circumstances. However, the overconfident investor tends to believes that his or her judgment is flawless ... even if the record doesn't back that up. Of course, whenever these kinds of people reap a windfall, they tend to completely forget all of their past misjudgments.  The Regretful Trader -- Regret can haunt you, in hindsight of an investment you could have made (but didn't) that would have netted you a ton of money. These investors make a mistake in judgment -- maybe by not selling a large volume of bitcoins when the price is high, thinking the price will go even higher ... only to see prices plummet in a few short hours. Selling too soon, just before market values soar, is another path to regret.  None of us are 100-percent immune to any of these behaviors. However, simply by knowing and making an effort to recognize these archetypes, you can boost the odds of making wiser decisions and understanding the trading community as a whole.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,William McCanless,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/11/8-bitcoin-trading-personalities-which-one-are-you,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bcc0efaa0ba83f5f51c556b7e630edff4a8e019-1600x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376512,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AqRv,1370950223,Israeli banks resisting bitcoin exchanges,"It's no secret that Bitcoin represents a huge change in the way we exchange money and that this challenges established financial institutions. That has led to a noticeable amount of push-back from banks and governments.  While the decentralized nature of Bitcoin means it cannot be shut down by any government or financial institution, such organizations can make it difficult for people to purchase the digital currency in the first place. That would effectively restrict access to the cryptocurrency. It appears that is happening to some degree in Israel, as reports from the Israel Army News website and users on the Bitcoin Forum indicate.  Reports from the Israel Army News website and users on the Bitcoin Forum indicate that Israeli banks are unofficially restricting access to virtual currencies by denying bank transfers to known exchanges. Even though the Google-translated version of the Israel Army News report is less than perfect, it appears that banks are limiting transactions between Israeli residents and known Bitcoin accounts, and in some cases even refusing them. Specific banks were not referenced on the Israel Army News website, but a user on the Bitcoin Forum reported that his/her bank, ""Mizrahi Tfahot"", sent the following email in response to a request for transfer of funds to Mt. Gox:  From a check made in the bank it seems that your account contains activity involved with virtual currency. The activity is characterized by issuing wire transfer to a company called MTGOX, through which this currency is purchased. Virtual currency is anonymous and unregulated. Trading them is not regulated and thus poses a high risk for the bank. Therefore, the bank has decided not to allow such activity for our customers, until guidance/clarifications are issued by the Israel Central Bank. You are requested to stop any such activity. We inform you that if you do not comply, we will have to refuse any activity directly or indirectly related to this area of activity.  It appears from these two reports that Israeli banks are giving fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) as their reasons for not dealing with bitcoin exchanges. However, by their own admission there are no regulations in the Jewish state to rule against use of bitcoin exchanges.  Do you live in Israel? Have you faced difficulties in buying digital currency?

42422959,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yv7h,1370941216,PRISM's effect on bitcoin prices,"Say what you will about the revealing of the US government’s program for phone surveillance as well as data collection from American tech companies known as “PRISM”. Since the story broke, it has clearly had an effect on the price of bitcoins. Don’t believe it? Take a look at this timeline of events from last week posted by the EFF when compared to a chart of the price of bitcoins on the Mt. Gox market.  The sell-off has continued. On Sunday, a time when the market for bitcoins is slow-moving historically, the price dropped during heavy volume trading.  The link between bitcoin price and public opinion has been well discussed. The rash of sell-offs in the past week indicates that some might be concerned about the role of bitcoin, considering how much the United States government knows about what occurs on the internet. While they cannot stop bitcoin, they can monitor it – which after the past weeks' revelations, they most certainly are doing.  That may be in contrast to what many bitcoin experts believe makes decentralized currencies important to people. As early investor Roger Ver recently said at a LeWeb 2013 panel on Bitcoin, people who believe that some currencies should be out of government hands should in fact be buying bitcoins as a result of the past week’s news.  “One of the things governments around the world do currently is they finance their wars and the things that they do through inflation. The just print money for whatever it is that they want to spend it on. If the world were using bitcoin that would no longer be a possibility. If you’re opposed to governments inflating money to pay for wars around the world, bitcoin should be something you’re interested in.” said Ver.  One could question whether or not people think that given that programs like PRISM are now out in the open. If they did, then wouldn’t the price of bitcoins be going up? If people around the world were concerned about U.S. government control, wouldn’t the price be spiking similar to the effect that Cyprus’s banking crisis at the end of March did?  No matter which way you view the price drop, bitcoin is a something that is heavily affected by sentiment. The fact that it is decentralized does not make it immune to the government’s actions. Decentralization doesn’t mean it is disconnected from all of the other complex systems that make up the economic system. Governments are huge influencers in the economy, and will continue to be into the future.  As CoinDesk’s Shirley Siluk recently pointed out, sentiment - the collective attitudes that people have about bitcoin - continues to be one the most important aspects that dictates its price. Sites like the Bitcoin Scope, which attempts to measure what people think about bitcoin in real time using news and social media analysis, will play a role in helping understand its value. Expect to see more tools that try to analyze and understand the reactions of bitcoin’s price to things like government control.  Bitcoin cannot be defined as an equity instrument like a stock and it is certainly not a fiat currency. It’s something that has not quite been seen before, freely traded on a market. Watching all of its price movements can be disheartening and fascinating at the same time.  It has the potential to change the way that we think about money. That will involve a discussion that global citizens of the world need to have given our reliance on fiat currency. Indications are that that perhaps bitcoin is not a way to avoid intrusion by governments. With such complex monitoring in place by the U.S. government, they’ve long known about bitcoin and likely have a sense about how it fits into the economy.  “There is a massive apparatus within the United States government that with complete secrecy has been building this enormous structure that has only one goal, and that is to destroy privacy and anonymity, not just in the United States but around the world,” said Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian reporter speaking on CNN. “That is not hyperbole. That is their objective.”  Despite its cryptographic elements and decentralized nature, bitcoin is becoming an integrated part of the economy simply by virtue of its value. Will people continue to use it despite government surveillance? How do you feel about bitcoin in regards to privacy? Is bitcoin an answer to government control?",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/11/prisms-effect-on-bitcoin-prices,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/050629ae61540fdd0c7e512462733e537d8d1c54-631x420.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376526,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AqeV,1370934850,Freicoin's attempt to free the economy,"Mark Fridenbach wants to change the world, one coin at a time. As one of the core development team behind Freicoin, he is trying to evolve a people’s coin, with lofty economic motives. The coin’s tagline is “Freedom from usury”. Will he succeed?  Friedenbach  was an application developer at NASA’s Ames Research Centre, where he assisted the astrobiology and lunar science labs. He programmed tools for visualising complex 3D data on commodity hardware while at the lab, and was constantly evaluating new tools for online collaboration.  “We were looking at how we could make NASA and its researchers more efficient using these tools, either by creating new tools for looking at planetary data or figuring out how to do an entire conference over the web.” In early March, he decided to quit his job and spend his time making money more efficient instead.  “What I realized is that Bitcoin is the most revolutionary technology, I would say ever. It creates a digital protocol for managing economic relationships, and to a very real extent I believe that defines who we are as human beings; our relationship with the world, with property and with each other,” he says.  The nature and behaviour of today’s corporations depend largely on credit, and the banking system that provides it is regulated by a central authority in the state, says Friedenbach. He sees Bitcoin as a means of redefining that, creating a way of decentralising not just currency, but the financial mechanics that currency supports, such as credit.  This is how Freicoin came about. “I felt that Bitcoin’s economic model wasn’t matched. We wanted something more stable, that had higher liquidity,” says Friedenbach, who is also heavily involved in supporting and developing Bitcoin. “It didn’t exist, so we created it.”  Friedenbach worked on Freicoin with a small group of others, including Jorge Timon, who conceived the idea, and who was also behind some of the ideas underpinning Ripple. Timon and Fridenbach are both involved with the Lifeboat Foundation, which is trying to encourage scientific achievement, while finding ways of protecting humankind from the risks associated with rapid technological development.  Released in December, Freicoin is a decentralised currency, like Bitcoin, but with some extra economic ideology baked in. That ideology is based on the writings of German merchant and economist Silvio Gesell. He advocated the use of money with zero interest, so that it would be pointless to hoard it and speculate with it. To assist with this, he founded the concept of demurrage; the application of a carrying cost to money.  A demurrage fee on money is designed to mirror the kinds of storage costs you find with other units of value. Gold, after all, must be stored. So must wheat, copper, and eggs, and they all cost money to hold. Why, asks Gesell’s theory, should money as a unit enjoy any special privileges? In fact, the argument goes, applying a holding fee on money would stop people hoarding it, and encourage them instead to use it for its original purpose: as a means of exchange.  In Freicoin, the demurrage fee is set at around 5%, per year, closely mirroring basic interest, says Friedenbach. “It’s the amount of the value of the currency that’s due to speculation. So since we counterbalance that we expect that there will be price stability over time. We expect that most of the volume of the transactions would be actual exchanges for goods and services, or investing, and not buying and selling on exchanges.”  But Freicoin is based on the same fundamental principles as Bitcoin: mining coins by solving the SHA-256 problem. Doesn’t this have speculation built in? After all, people don’t mine coins for altruistic reasons. If they did that, they’d mine proteins instead.  “It’s 95% speculative value right now,” admits Friedenbach, who says that this phase is necessary as the group “bootstraps” the coin. “It will transition over time.”  But Freicoin differs from other mining-based coins in several ways. Firstly, miners do not get all of the coins. Instead, a foundation designed to control the currency in the early stages will distribute 80% of them as they are mined. These coins will be distributed to projects that contribute to the wellbeing of humanity.  Miners will get 20% of the coins over the entire distribution period, but they won’t all be distributed equally. The rate of distribution will decrease on a sliding scale, starting with 30% at launch, and shrinking to 5% after all of the coins have been mined. That 5% represents the demurrage fee, which is fed back into the mining community to cover operational costs. So, the demurrage fee effectively doubles as a mining subsidy.  How does the foundation distribute its 80%? It has to be careful about how it grants the money, says Friedenbach. “Right now, if we were to make those donations, the charities would just turn it around and send it to the speculators,” he says. The foundation is working on a solution. In the meantime, the coins are held in escrow. There’s a discussion on it herehttp://www.freicoin.org/freicoin-foundation-development-thread-t81.html.  Mining is a means, not an end, argues Friedenbach. “It’s a distraction, and I can’t wait until we reach the bottom and it stops being one.” The current race towards ASIC miners (which is particularly frenzied among Bitcoin miners) will settle when we begin reaching the limits of silicon technology, he warns.  “This is continuously improving, but only because we’re into a gold rush stage,” he says. “After a couple of generations of ASICs you won’t see many improvements, so things will start to settle down and the other way that they will settle is if there is some level of price stability in Bitcoin.”  If mining is merely the means, then what is the end? He is more interested in longer-term services built to support economic innovations in Freicoin. One of these is called Freicoin Assets. This would enable people to produce their own tokens, representing anything that they wanted, including stocks, bonds, and IOUs. “We will let Freicoin be basically the medium for exchanging credit and IOUs in the same way that bitcoin is exchanging hard cash.” He hopes to have Freicoin Assets ready by Christmas.  Friedenbach hopes that Freicoin will pick up where Bitcoin left off. “Looking longer term, I think a coin has to bring something special to the table. It has to bring something new and original. Something that has material benefits to the people using it,” he says. “Here, I’m going to step back a little say that there hasn’t been that much innovation in Bitcoin, unfortunately.”  He has other developments in mind, such as a system for running microtransactions ‘off-chain’, to enable very small transactions, which could be used for different applications such as pay-per-view, or online newspapers.  “For self-driving cars, what about paying a tip to all the people in the slow lane when you’re in the fast lane,” he suggests, citing a talk he heard by a Google engineer.  Ultimately, this feels like a coin for the 99%. Whereas some other coins tend to focus on tweaking the parameters for existing cryptocurrencies, few of them seem to focus on changing the motivations. There are some exceptions, such as PPCoin with its proof of stake concept, which was designed to be more energy-efficient and secure than Bitcoin. Litecoin, too, made some fundamental changes by introducing the Scrypt algorithm to make mining more egalitarian. And then, there’s Ripple, which like Freicoin has the potential to make peer-to-peer credit more workable.  The comparison to Ripple, though, (which Friedenbach makes several times) raises other questions. Ripple has been criticised online, including in the comments section of this publication, for being too centralised. And like Ripple, Freicoin’s controlling body holds 80% of the currency, and gives it away on its own terms. This has led some to try and subvert the process, removing demurrage altogether.  Whenever anyone tries to change the rules of the game this much, there is bound to be pushback. Freicoin’s success will depend ultimately on how well it achieves its goal of creating a free and open exchange mechanism for goods and services, which will in turn depend on the number of goods and services providers supporting it. Supporting the Freicoin economy is a key mandate for its grant-making process. We’ll monitor those first grant awards with interest.
