42374666,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1pWb,1653349573,First Mover Asia: Funds Lost Billions in the Terra Collapse. Here are the Ongoing Effects; Bitcoin Sees Red,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: While stocks had a good day, bitcoin and other major cryptos continued to struggle.  Insights: The effects of the Terra collapse will continue to ripple through the investment eco-system.  Technician's take: A brief relief bounce is likely, similar to what occurred in late February and late March.

While stocks spiked in Monday trading, major cryptocurrencies continued their recent trudge through a red gloom.  By early afternoon, bitcoin had fallen almost 4% over the past 24 hours to the low end of the $29,000-$30,000 range it has occupied for the nearly two weeks since the UST stablecoin and LUNA token that supports it imploded. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has dropped 26% from its high this month near $40,000 and roughly 55% since reaching its record peak last November. Ether, the second largest crypto by market cap, was down approximately 3.5% over the same period and changing hands a little below $2,000.  Most major cryptos spent much of the day in the red with AVAX recently off over 8% and GALA, ALGO and MANA each down more than 6% amid ongoing investor fears about inflation and a possible recession as central banks tighten monetary policy. Trading was choppy underlining these concerns.  ""We don't have earnings [this week}, we haven't had a stablecoin lose $48 billion, and we haven't had a Presidential Executive Order,"" 3iQ Digital Asset's Head of Research Mark Connors told CoinDesk, adding: ""It's about inflation and that's uncertain. So we are rangebound.""  Stocks traveled a different paths, as they've done for most the past few days, rising after senior executives at JPMorgan Chase said that U.S. consumer credit market was in good shape short-term. The S&P 500, which spent a large portion of Friday in bear market territory, meaning that the index was trading at least 20% lower than its previous high, increased 1.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.9% and 1.5%, respectively. Last week, the indices plunged almost 3%.  Cryptos have spent much of the year tracking stocks so the latest separation represents at least a small twist in their evolving relationship. 3iQ's Connors said that digital assets will likely remain rangebound at least until the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics issues its next consumer price index report (CPI) in early June. The CPI may show if inflationary pressure is waning.  ""For right now, you might have some people pushing uncertain markets to see what breaks but I don't think there will be breaks either way,"" Connors said.  Markets  S&P 500: 3,973 +1.8%  DJIA: 31,880 +1.9%  Nasdaq: 11,535 +1.5%  Gold: $1,853 +0.4%  Insights  The ongoing damage to Terra investors  The destruction of the Terra protocol has meant a significant hit on the balance sheets of all of its investors. Data about the carnage is available to view on Block explorers, including Korean VC firm Hashed’s staked tokens, which were at one time worth over $3.5 billion.  Hashed’s loss on luna and other Terra ecosystem tokens may not have adversely affected its cash position. Hashed got most of these tokens through its investment in Terraform Labs, and likely bought more of the tokens as it peaked – and probably sold some too.  But for any liquid crypto fund, cash is periphery. Cash is boring. Cash doesn’t have the same amount of leverage.  To understand the significance of crypto on the VC’s balance sheet — and why it matters so much for Hashed - let's look at how Singapore’s Three Arrows Capital made a $1.2 billion position (using January 2021 pricing) in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). (New York-based Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.)  Three Arrows Capital is licensed to manage assets of not more than SGD250 million (US$181 million) for its Singapore entity, according to a filing with the Monetary Authority of Singapore. It also has an entity in the British Virgin Islands, with which it has split the GBTC position equally, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Even the 50-50 split would exceed the amount that Three Arrows Capital is authorized to manage.  Three Arrows likely accomplished this through leveraged bitcoin, as BTC has always been an option to buy into the GBTC. Three Arrows wanted to do this because its interest in GBTC is a premium harvesting play, exploiting its current discount with a hope that it returns to a premium or at least to market value.  Three Arrows’ history has shown this wasn’t a wise investment because of the market downturn through most of 2022 and GBTC’s structural problems.  Let's return to Hashed and the other VC firms that held Terra’s tokens in their liquid portfolios.  One scenario is that some firms used the LUNA they had staked as collateral for the leveraged purchase of further tokens for both trading, and to invest in funding rounds that used a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) or another investment vehicle.  Creating an agreement with an over-the-counter desk that pledged staked LUNA for crypto to buy into the SAFT would be a simple task for a fund. Once the lock-up period for the specific token was complete, the OTC desk could be repaid through gains from that token. And the best part of it all is that this could be done without touching its cash position.  So when a fund takes a massive hit on its token portfolio, the effect reverberates through the entire ecosystem. Now, post-LUNA, there will be billions less in dry powder available for VCs to deploy even if their cash positions are relatively sound.  Antalpha Technologies Managing Director Max Liao doesn’t think this will scare off institutional investors. Rather, he’s reminded of the early 2000s dot-com bubble where companies died as fast as they were born. Despite the dozens if not hundreds that imploded, taking with them billions in venture capital dollars, this gave us Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG) and PayPal (PYPL).  “While the importance of profit is a given, the events of the past few weeks have only underscored that due diligence and risk management are also critical factors in the execution of successful venture investment,” he said to CoinDesk. “It is imperative that emergent protocols and potential investors remember that businesses that can change the world learn from both their own success and the failure of others.”  For entrepreneurs and builders, this could mean a change of structure for that next investment that involves more cash and fewer tokens.  But the problem with cash is that it comes with much more conservative terms, particularly in the size of rounds and the risk investors are willing to take.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Holds Support at $27K-30K; Resistance at $35K  Bitcoin (BTC) has traded in a tight range between $28,500 and $30,000 over the past week. Despite short-term swings, the cryptocurrency has managed to hold support above $27,000, which could keep some buyers active.  BTC declined by as much as 2% over the past 24 hours.  Momentum signals are improving on the daily chart, similar to what occurred in late February and late March. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart continues to rise from oversold levels, which could point to a relief bounce in price.  Still, the daily RSI will need to rise above 50 to determine if a price bounce has staying power.  On the weekly chart, the RSI is the most oversold since March 2020, although momentum signals remain negative. That suggests upside could be limited for BTC, initially toward the $33,000-$35,000 resistance zone.

42374670,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1paN,1653348553,"At Davos, Crypto Is No Longer on the Outside","DAVOS, Switzerland — Even on the trains, you can’t get away from crypto.  The World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual meeting – canceled in 2021, delayed earlier in 2022 – formally kicks off Tuesday in Davos, Switzerland. Cryptocurrency advocates opened the parties up on Sunday with bitcoin (BTC) pizza stalls and blockchain pavilions with flashy banners lining the famed promenade.  WEF attendees were bombarded with signs advertising stablecoin issuer Circle and crypto brokerage Bitcoin Suisse as they got off their planes in Zurich or trains in Davos. Casual passers-by talked about owning shiba inu (SHIB) and ADA. At the end of the day, the crypteratti dispersed to one of the nearby Airbnbs.  “Five years ago, we were the only crypto company on Promenade,” said Sandra Ro, CEO of the Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC) at a kickoff party at a local church (dubbed “The Sanctuary”) right outside the closed-off conference venue. “And look at it now,” she added.  Perhaps nothing announced the turbulent crypto industry’s arrival at the world’s biggest business table more than the fact that the WEF itself is holding serious discussions about digital money, with industry participants as key players.  Jeremy Allaire, chairman and CEO at Circle Pay, and Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, sat side by side on Monday to discuss remittances and digital money at an issue briefing at the WEF media village. The panel, titled “Remittances for Recovery: A New Era of Digital Money,” also included Asif Saleh, executive director of the BRAC, a developmental non-governmental organization based in Bangladesh.  The forum also hosted a discussion on the future of the global economy, the U.S. economy and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) themselves. That’s not to say the forum’s global leaders accept cryptocurrencies just yet – but they aren’t ignoring it.  Creeping in  A panel featuring Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman, PayPal (PYPL) CEO Dan Schulman, U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and economist Jason Furman that purportedly focused on the future of the U.S. economy continued the discussion on crypto.  “For a lot of countries around the world, digital central bank currencies (CBDC) might make sense, I don’t think the United States needs to do them,” said Furman, an economics professor at Harvard University.  All of the panelists quickly became very enthusiastic about sharing their thoughts on stablecoins and the like, despite the best efforts of New York Times Deputy Managing Editor Rebecca Blumenstein, who moderated the panel, to put a stop to it.  Toomey mentioned a bill he introduced to regulate stablecoins, asking about the role of a CBDC in a world where private stablecoins flourish.  “I think we ought to have a framework that allows privately issued stablecoins to thrive in a rational framework and if that happens, I’m not sure how much we need a digital dollar,” he said.  Another panel focused on the global economy also brought up the value proposition of bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies.  “The younger generation says the older generation has devalued the dollar or the value of other currencies, so maybe something new isn’t so bad,” said David M. Rubenstein, co-founder of the Carlyle Group, in a panel discussing the future of the global economy amid slower economic growth and the fallout from sanctions.  Official presence  The panels officially intended to discuss cryptocurrencies went far deeper.  Garlinghouse and Allaire commented on the future of finance broadly and the urgent need for regulatory clarity in the crypto world during their remittances panel.  According to Allaire, whose company issues USD coin (USDC), a crypto asset pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar, the world is moving to a place where the concept of a cross-border payment will be as ”crazy sounding” as the concept of a cross-border email.  ”We don’t think about cross-border emails. We don’t think about having a cross-border web browsing session, it’s absurd to think about that. And I believe we’re on the cusp of that with money. And I think when it comes to remittances, I believe the concept of a remittance will also disappear,” Allaire said.  Garlinghouse, whose company Ripple is currently embroiled in a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Committee over the sale of the digital token XRP in 2013, warned that governments control financial systems and said that it's unlikely to change in his lifetime.  “The thing to think about I think is if you approach the regulators with ‘You need to adapt to us’ that is dead on arrival,” Garlinghouse said.  Responding to a question on the lack of regulatory certainty in the crypto sector, Garlinghouse said that regulatory clarity is a problem that needs to be solved, adding that the U.S. is lagging behind in setting up clear rules for the crypto sector.  “I say don’t incorporate in the U.S. because that’s where some are being hostile and uncertain, and there’s much better clarity in Japan and Singapore, or go here in Switzerland to invest globally having more clarity, more certainty will help [drive innovation]. It’ll help remittances because of that,” Garlinghouse said.  Allaire, who has been attending the Davos conference since 2008, told CoinDesk that crypto had reached a new level of prominence at the WEF and hopes for next year are already high.  Allaire closed the panel by saying that a year from now, he hopes the crypto sector would come to the table with more examples of solutions that work for the people.  That’s not to say central bankers and finance regulators are enamored with the idea of digital assets.  On a WEF congress main stage, Kristalina Georgieva, managing director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are not money but assets.  “A prerequisite for something that would be money is to be a stable store of value,” Georgieva said.  She was joined by Axel P. Lehmann, chairman of the board at Credit Suisse, Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput, governor of Bank of Thailand and François Villeroy de Galhau, governor of the central bank of France to discuss CBDCs.  A recent report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), also known as the central bank for central banks, found that nine out of 10 central banks around the world are exploring the design and issuance of CBDCs.  Outside, looking out  Promenade, the main street that leads to the Congress where the official WEF panels take place, is dominated by crypto companies. Filecoin, which hosted a crowded welcome party on Sunday, resides in a sanctuary at the beginning of the street, followed by Circle just a few hundred feet down.  Among other big crypto names with lounges and their own programming are Polkadot, Securrency, GBBC and Casper Labs, among others. One thing that all of them have in common: big ads.  In “2018 it was all crypto castles and now it’s all about branding,” said Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation. “It’s established companies coming to Davos as an industry.”",POSITIVE,BTC | SHIB,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | SHIB,"Sandali Handagama, Helene Braun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/23/at-davos-crypto-is-no-longer-on-the-outside,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02059295777f9f4291858b4109a6bdedf7334de8-4608x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374661,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1pNn,1653348000,Wall Street Says a Fed Digital Dollar Spells Destruction for Banks,"Wall Street bankers are arguing that the Federal Reserve launching its own digital dollar could crack the foundations of banking as we know it, according to letters industry lobbyists sent to the U.S. central bank on Friday.  The Fed invited comments on a report exploring the future of a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC) issued in the U.S. A government-run digital dollar could have profound implications on the financial sector, and also on the stablecoins issued by cryptocurrency firms.  “Current research overwhelmingly undermines the purported benefits of a CBDC and instead indicates that a CBDC would seriously disrupt the financial system, significantly harming consumers and businesses,” said Greg Baer, who runs one of Wall Street’s lobbying arms in Washington, the Bank Policy Institute.  Another banking group in Washington, the American Bankers Association, predicted in its own letter that a digital dollar would mean “deposits accounting for 71% of bank funding are at risk of moving to the Federal Reserve.”  That would dramatically increase the cost of funding in the banking sector to an “unsustainable” level, the ABA letter said.  The Fed board has been weighing the logic of introducing a digital dollar, although officials have been careful to remain neutral and suggest that any plan should have the backing of Congress and the administration. That’s the line, too, that Michael Barr – President Joe Biden’s pick to be the next Fed vice chairman for supervision – echoed at his confirmation hearing last week. However, several new Fed board members were sworn in on Monday, marking an official transition to the era of Biden appointees.  While a U.S. digital dollar has frequently come up in congressional hearings and debates over legislation, no bill has yet found traction that would encourage the Fed to set it in motion. The early negotiations over a CBDC often include its potential effect on stablecoins, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said he expects private stablecoins could coexist with a digital dollar.  BPI’s letter also argued that “one of the most frequently cited reasons in support of a CBDC is that it would increase financial inclusion, yet, as discussed further below, we are unaware of any substantiated use case for CBDC that would benefit low- and moderate-income people.”",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/23/wall-street-says-a-fed-digital-dollar-spells-destruction-for-banks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63b2c7f01747536571f65ed81de6a84d9d53dc22-6751x4501.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , reached $30,554, up 1.2%. Bitcoin Price Sheds Gains The Bitcoin price&apos;s downhill movement is becoming increasingly apparent. A rally towards $33,700 is possible. For nearly two weeks, the Bitcoin price Fear and Greed indicator has been at high fear levels. Because more investors are afraid to invest in the present BTC price, this Index can be utilized as a contrarian positive indicator, allowing smart money to accumulate huge orders. On the 6-hour chart, what was formerly deemed to be a confusing sideways market is now coiling into a very bullish pattern, indicating smart money involvement. The price of bitcoin is creating a sideways triangle. From an Elliott wave standpoint, the lengthy sideways action justifies a wave B pattern. Since the initial countertrend rally on May 13th around $31,200, it has spent disproportionate time in the $30,000 zone. If the technicals hold, another countertrend profit-taking rise with targets of $33,700 and $34,000 will occur before significant bearish resistance returns. A breach below wave A at $28,630 invalidates the bullish premise. If the bears succeed in breaking through this barrier, the next target might be $23,500, a 20% drop from the current BTC price.

In addition, the claims process ensures that dot allocations are recorded in the Polkadot genesis block. Clients of Coinbase Custody will receive Polkadot addresses through this process. With this, they can claim their dots directly. &apos;Polkadot is one of the most intriguing cryptocurrency projects currently in development. Interoperability and scaling are two of the most pressing issues confronting blockchain-based platforms today. We&apos;re excited to collaborate with Polkadot and the Web3 Foundation to provide dot token holders with the most secure and effective tools for managing and staking their tokens, &apos;Sam McIngvale, CEO of Coinbase Custody, stated.

42374668,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1pXr,1653337630,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Unable to Hold $30K, Altcoins Mixed","Bitcoin (BTC) failed to stay above $30,000 on Monday as some buyers remained on the sidelines. The cryptocurrency tumbled later in the New York trading day, indicating a loss of short-term momentum.  Alternative cryptos (altcoins) were mixed on Monday. For example, Fantom's FTM token rose by as much as 16% over the past 24 hours, while Decentraland's MANA token declined by 3% over the same period. Choppy trading conditions suggests some caution among crypto traders, especially over the past week.  For now, bitcoin is stuck in a tight trading range and is at risk of a breakdown. ""From a trading standpoint, [a] breach higher may offer an opportunity to fade, targeting a break to fresh yearly lows,"" Michael Boutros, an analyst at DailyFX wrote in an email to CoinDesk. If a breakdown occurs, Boutros has a downside target of $19,666 for BTC.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  Still, some analysts have noticed signs of capitulation, which could support a relief bounce in price. Sean Farrell, vice president of digital assets at FundStrat, stated that recent selling pressure was driven by spot market traders rather than futures traders. That suggests a large unwind of leveraged positions is unlikely, similar to what occurred in previous sell-offs.  Instead, BTC's downtrend could be gradual, especially if macroeconomic headwinds continue to linger. ""Despite the evidence of capitulation and waning investor sentiment, the current macro backdrop still poses significant headwinds for cryptoasset prices, Farrell wrote in a research note.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $29,148, −2.69%    ●Ether (ETH): $1,987, −1.22%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $3,974, +1.86%    ●Gold: $1,853 per troy ounce, +0.60%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.86%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Relief from US dollar?  The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is roughly 3% below its recent high reached on May 13, which could offer support for BTC because of its negative correlation to the greenback.  Previous peaks in the DXY have coincided with price troughs in BTC. And last year's acceleration in the U.S. dollar occurred alongside a failed breakout in BTC around $69,000, leading to a 60% drop in the cryptocurrency's price.  The index's performance is not a perfect signal for BTC, however, especially because of macroeconomic uncertainty.  The chart below shows the 90-day correlation between BTC and the U.S. dollar, which is mostly negative. Still, the correlation could rise during market turbulence, similar to what occurred in 2018 and 2020.

42374667,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1pRZ,1653336524,"Crypto Industry Battles to Exempt NFTs, DeFi From Tax Reporting Rules","Crypto industry representatives pushed back at attempts to make them report details of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions and retail payments to tax authorities at a meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris on Monday.  International tax standard-setters want to extend existing bank sector rules to stop foreign bitcoin (BTC) holdings from being kept secret from revenue services. And they may end up extending them further than both the existing rules that apply to banking and the money laundering norms currently being applied to crypto by parallel standard-setter the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  Coinbase’s Vice President for Tax Lawrence Zlatkin told the OECD that its plans, set out in a March consultation, were “overly broad,” because they don’t just look at financial assets used as a means of payment or investment. Zlatkin added that the proposals would merely impose additional burdens on a relatively new and nascent industry.  Under existing rules, known as the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) – whose U.S. equivalent is the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) – banks are required to identify any account holders who are tax residents abroad and send their details to the appropriate authorities to make sure they aren’t evading tax.  But the industry has argued these requirements are a lot harder to meet for NFTs whose price – unlike, say, stocks or gold – isn’t known at any given time. They also point out that similar nondigital assets, such as paintings, aren’t included in existing rules.  Attempting to include DeFi applications could also be premature, Zlatkin said. “Maybe we should wait until they fit the parameters more readily,” he said, citing DeFi systems that don’t have anyone who could be deemed in control, and maybe don’t even see themselves as having customers. “We should focus on what we know.”  What should be reported?  Parallel money laundering rules set by the global FATF require crypto wallet holders to carry out identity checks only if a particular crypto asset is intended for payment or as a means of investment. But tax officials worry it might be too difficult to apply that test to the diverse range of crypto assets out there.  One alternative would be to only consider those crypto assets, from bitcoin to NFTs, that are “actively traded on an established market,” said Lisa Zarlenga, a partner at law firm Steptoe & Johnson, who spoke on behalf of lobby group the Chamber of Digital Commerce.  That could involve looking at whether the prices being offered and accepted are easily accessible and published, and would in practice require disclosure for anything traded on a major exchange, such as Kraken or Coinbase (COIN), Zarlenga said.  Going further than what is done for traditional banking assets, such as interest and dividends, could be a breach of the principle known as ""technology neutrality"" because it treats digital assets more stringently, Zarlenga added. “Just because they're digital doesn’t mean they should be included.""  The OECD appears to think that merely applying existing anti-money laundering rules – which look at how a given asset is used – would put wallet providers in an impossible quandary when deciding whether or not they have to report a transaction.  “A number of delegates found it a very difficult criterion to apply in practice for binary reporting,” the OECD’s Philip Kerfs said. Determining whether, say, a given Bored Ape NFT is kept for investment or for aesthetic appeal would constitute a judgment call.  The OECD responds  Regulators are grappling with exactly how any reporting system might work – such as how to set the exact level of trading at which assets have to be disclosed to the authorities – but may also believe that digital assets might just be riskier, and hence deserving of tougher treatment.  Erika Nijenhuis, senior counsel at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, said on Monday that Zlatkin and Zarlenga’s comments “suggest to me that the commenters don’t believe that there are additional risks to tax compliance from the digital nature of the type of assets that we are talking about. Why is that the right answer?”  Nijenhuis also hit back at industry arguments that regulation could constrain a fast-growing and relatively young sector. “I’m not sure the fact that something is new is necessarily a reason not to do it,” she said. “CRS and FATCA were new when they started.”  ""Is there a risk that a substantial portion of transactions will be carried on these exchanges … and we will have missed an opportunity to require reporting?” if the framework doesn't address decentralized exchanges now, Nijenhuis asked.  Her remarks imply that industry pleas of overregulation might go unheard. But in other areas, such as stopping crypto exchanges from fleeing to less regulated jurisdictions, some parts of the industry are pleading for the OECD to take an even tougher approach.  ‘Nexus rules’  Tax experts such as KPMG have advised extending what are known as the “nexus rules” – meaning an exchange legally established in a tax haven that serves European customers would still have to play by European norms.  Treasury's Nijenhuis even raised the idea of creating blacklists of places with weak crypto rules, analogous to the list of uncooperative tax and money-laundering jurisdictions kept by the EU. This idea has some support from industry players who don’t want others getting an unfair advantage.  “We would endorse broader nexus rules,” Coinbase's Zlatkin said. “I don't think we would argue for entities migrating to places where there is no reporting, and easily do that and circumvent these rules.”  Zlatkin also endorsed the crypto blacklist idea. “We don't want to have entities incorporate or otherwise exist and thumb their noses at this whole process,” he said.  Lawmakers in the European Union have even proposed getting securities market regulators to issue a list of high-risk crypto companies, which could in practice outlaw doing business with firms in tax havens. But the European Commission, brokering talks to introduce money laundering rules for the sector, has argued that that plan could breach international trade laws.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/23/crypto-industry-battles-to-exempt-nfts-defi-from-tax-reporting-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5475b68d6608df125fb914f397f8101432dd271a-5227x2876.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417152,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3oL,1653335209,What Is the Sandbox and How To Get Started,"Gaming and crypto are increasingly getting mixed up with terms like “metaverse” and “play-to-earn.” If you want to check out this new world but you don’t know where to start, the answer could be a crypto game called The Sandbox.  Your first steps in The Sandbox  First, go to The Sandbox site on any browser. As usual with blockchain projects online, the first thing you’ll be asked to do when you enter is to connect a crypto wallet. If you don’t have one, don’t worry: they are easy and free to create.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Metaverse Week  You don’t necessarily need to have any crypto tokens in your wallet to get started on The Sandbox. You just need a safe place ready to receive the tokens you might earn.  Next, you have to supply an email address and choose a nickname.  You’ll be prompted to create an avatar and customize different body parts: hair, top, legwear, shoes, etc. You can look very different than you do in real life with blue or green skin or try to make an avatar that looks something like you. The biggest problem you'll face at this step is indecisiveness, given there are so many choices.  Now that you have an avatar, you’ll find The Sandbox world is structured according to a map, for ease of navigation. You can see all the plots of digital land in the world and click whichever interests you. This geographic style of presentation of projects-within-the-project is pretty standard for metaverse games.  If you run your cursor over the map, you’ll see that a lot of the things there are “experiences,” typically games with levels to be completed. They’re designed by your fellow players, not by the developers behind the environment itself. You’re likely to see pop-up boxes announcing you have completed “0/15 quests.” If you want, you can just jump straight into one of the quests. Before you’ll be able to, you’ll be asked to download The Sandbox client software to do so which is a free and quick process.  Naturally, you can start doing more things faster if you invest some of your own money. For instance, you can start designing your own game. But don’t worry, if you are not comfortable or ready, you can just start playing without investing any money. It’s best to explore and research as much as you need to understand the experience and if it’s worth your investment.  The Sandbox graphics have been compared to the globally popular game Minecraft, given its boxy aesthetic. Those cubic components of the world are called “voxels.”  What is The Sandbox?  The Sandbox is an open-world online multiplayer game, where players compete to earn non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It’s part of a breed of online games that have gained in popularity in tandem with the hype around NFTs. Another is Decentraland.  The Sandbox has actually been around for much longer than the NFT boom – they've been putting out games for mobile devices since 2011, with no blockchain element at all. It was only in 2018 that the company pivoted towards blockchain.  The substantial advance of The Sandbox’s move to the blockchain is that players can trade the things they build in the game and make their ownership verifiable outside the game environment. You don’t need the developers to say you own your Sandbox creations. It is recorded indelibly in the blockchain.  Earning SAND tokens  The project’s utility token is SAND. You’ll need it to buy anything else. It was originally made on the Ethereum network but began transitioning to Polygon in 2021, along with the whole Sandbox NFT ecosystem. The project cited environmental reasons for the switch, saying it could reduce its carbon footprint.  SAND is also used for staking on The Sandbox network on Polygon, meaning that holders of the token can participate in verifying transactions on the network if they deposit their tokens temporarily. They are rewarded for doing so with more SAND tokens. As of May 2022, The Sandbox said almost $100 million in value of SAND tokens were locked in staking.  LAND tokens for building  After SAND, you’ll want to think about LAND, which is required in order to build anything within the game. There is a fixed supply of LAND tokens: 166,464. That means, in theory, if user numbers and public interest in the game continue to grow then the value of those LAND tokens should increase.  Read More: Investing in Real Estate in the Metaverse  Once you have LAND, you can get creative. For one thing, you can make your own games-within-the-game using freely downloadable Game Maker software. If you want, you can do this in cooperation with other players. You can also create visual artworks using VoxEdit, software which describes itself as ""the leading software that allows you to create, rig and animate your own voxel-based NFTs.""  The items that you create this way are given blockchain tokens called ASSETs, this makes them tradable and they can be turned into NFTs. These tokens can have other tokens called GEMs and CATALYSTs attached to them, affecting their value. But this is something you can delve into once you've gotten started – you may not be interested in this aspect of The Sandbox at all.  The final thing to note about LAND is that you can also rent your LAND out to other users. This means you can earn a passive income from it while others get a chance to be the creative ones.  Read More: How to Invest in the Metaverse  Alpha Season  The Sandbox Alpha Seasons are open, multi-week testing events that give players an opportunity to experience new functions. Alpha Season events are open to all players with a Sandbox account. The platform also offers NFT tickets called Alpha Passes, which allow players to access all experiences offered during Alpha Season, in addition to other rewards.  The platform released its Alpha Season 1 in November 2021, Alpha Season 2 in February and Alpha Season 3 on August 24. The latest event offered access to over 90 experiences over 10 weeks from brand partners like Bored Ape Yacht Club and Atari.  One last note: You don’t need a lot of technical know-how to do any of the above. The software that The Sandbox employs is supposed to be accessible to amateurs, so don’t be put off if designing a video game or creating an NFT sounds beyond your skill level. The best way to find out is to just explore and play around within the environment and see what else you want to try. You might find it easier than you expect.

39418,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=236897,1653334203,What Makes Decentralized Finance The Biggest Thing In The World?,"More and more people are deciding to enter the world of decentralized finance. However, for those not familiar with the subject, it can be difficult to understand due to the differences from the traditional system. What is Decentralized Finance? Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an ecosystem that allows users to use different financial products and services. With this financial system, you can carry out a currency exchange operation, take out a loan, carry out placement, and take out insurance. Therefore, it is different from the traditional financial system. There is no central counterparty, and it works on blockchain technology. El País explained this to Martín Larzabal, director of Cryptotrust Fiduciary. DeFi applications create Financial services and products (known as DApps) with a foundation on the blockchain. The most widely used is Ethereum, although there are others such as Solana and Cardano, he added. Decentralized finance uses smart contracts, which &apos;are written in code. They allow two counterparties to set the conditions of a transaction. They do this without the need to trust a third party to execute it,&apos; he said. Also, there are no &apos;names,&apos; and you do not need someone to authorize you to open an account. But, yes, interacting requires a virtual wallet and usually requires placing the money in the smart contract. How can you know the size of decentralized finance? Larzabal said that the amount of money housed in sm...",NEUTRAL,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/what-makes-decentralized-finance-the-biggest-thing-in-the-world/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-makes-decentralized-finance-the-biggest-thing-in-the-world,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png
42421586,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoeb7,1653333843,Martin Shkreli Is Back. He Loves Crypto,"Every so often a figure arises who so perfectly encapsulates society’s great flaws, humankind’s natural greed and our cross-cultural tendency to scapegoat our problems. That person is divisive, obviously. But also strangely beloved.  Martin Shkreli, 39, the former hedge fund manager turned convicted felon and social media troll with a cult-like following, was recently released from prison. Shkreli is that almost-mythic person who signifies all that is wrong with society, and he relishes the role.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  He has also captured the attention of the crypto industry, a field as known as much for its problems as for the solutions it may offer. Crypto, apparently, has captured his attention – in what may appear to be an obvious marriage.  Last Wednesday, the Brooklyn, N.Y.-born former pharmaceutical executive was released from federal prison in New York after serving four years of a seven-year sentence for securities fraud and was transferred to a halfway house. Shkreli is known infamously for buying the rights to an antiparasitic drug called Dara­prim and increasing the cost to $750 per tablet from $17.50.  Although drug price jumps are somewhat routine within the for-profit U.S. health care and research industry, Shkreli achieved instantaneous notoriety for what was obvious price gouging of a life-saving drug the World Health Organization lists as an essential medicine used by pregnant women, the elderly and HIV-positive patients.  In a nonjury trial on various financial schemes, federal and state health regulators argued Shkreli attempted to form a monopoly over this drug by keeping generic versions off the market. He said he had his reasons: that insurance companies, not people, would pay the increased price and the profits would go to developing other medical technologies.  He lavished in the abuse and confusion he created. On social media he was known for his inflammatory statements, like saying he wished he had raised the drug’s price even higher. He paid $2 million for a single recording of a Wu-Tang Clan album, and followed that rap group’s wishes by keeping it under lock and key. (Incidentally, Shkreli paid part of his $7.4 million fine through the government sale of that album, ""Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,"" which is now owned by a decentralized autonomous organization.)  See also: Martin Shkreli's Wu-Tang Clan Album Now Belongs to a DAO  And, following his recent release from low-security imprisonment, Shkreli wants to return as troublemaker and hornet nest kicker. Mere hours after settling into his court-mandated halfway house, Shkreli began to post under an alias. The account, @Enrique5060782, which is currently suspended, made little attempt to hide Shkreli’s real identity. (Much to his lawyer’s chagrin, I imagine, who said upon Shkreli’s release that his client wouldn’t be available for comment.)  A knack for controversy  By Friday, crypto’s “terminally online” knew who Enrique was and what he was about: crypto. On Saturday evening, Shkreli participated in a Twitter Spaces audio event where he revealed that he used Uniswap behind bars, thinks ether (ETH) will flippen bitcoin (BTC) and views “utility tokens” as a good idea.  His statements during the Saturday night stream with upwards of 3,000 listeners, and otherwise, show that Shkreli is not only informed but still knows how to create controversy. He said he’s planning a non-fungible token (NFT) drop, that Enrique may not be his only alternative avatar and that he may be participating – perhaps as a developer or investor – in other big name decentralized finance (DeFi) projects.  “The idea that I can’t buy a Tesla share without going through this [Securities and Exchange Commission] apparatus and all these other steps is kinda nuts,” Shkreli said in the Twitter Spaces. “There are people breaking the silo and trying to destroy it forever, I hope.”  He was referencing synthetic, token-variants of publicly traded stocks like “Apple coin and a Tesla coin,” which is what fellow flawed entrepreneur Do Kwon, of the imploded Terra network, was targeting with the unregulated securities exchange called Mirror Protocol.  A16z founder Marc Andressen and other giants of the venture capital space, along with the recording artist and Web 3 enthusiast Sia, interacted with Shkreli during his Saturday night ramble as Enrique. A Substack representative reportedly asked to join the newsletter platform.  Many people in the business world consider Shkreli a “public intellectual” worth listening to, noting his intelligence. He graduated high school in two years and found his way working at a premier hedge fund before starting his own.  Some appreciate his self-awareness: He has lovingly referred to himself as “Pharma Bro,” the jibe used in many headlines. And when he speaks, on a variety of subjects, he is convincing. Prison wasn’t too bad, he said. He once said he has “an extremely weird form of sarcasm” and that it’s “fun to see people get so animated.”  “Authenticity is really important to me,” he told Vanity Fair in 2015. That’s a term also used in crypto.  An industry that celebrates controversy  Although no one speaks for the entire crypto industry, it’s fair to say Shkreli has received a largely warm reception. Despite receiving numerous insults and reminders that he’s a convicted felon during his short Twitter stint, the overall mood was pure delight.  “Martin Shkreli literally knows more about Crypto than 99% of you from prison. He’s talking about [proof-of-stake] and [S]tepn. No excuses. Autism unleashed!” venture fund Autism Capital’s Twitter account posted.  Shkreli getting involved in crypto makes sense. The industry tolerates, even celebrates, controversial figures. It forgives scammers easily and allows people to build second lives – as pseudonyms or not. Onlookers might see Shkreli’s open embrace of crypto and crypto's reciprocity as speaking to crypto’s nefarious or facile attributes. Scams absolutely run rampant. In a sense, these people are right. If “Pharma Bro” completes his transformation to Crypto Bro, that is saying something about crypto’s ends and purpose.  See also: Why CoinDesk Respects Pseudonymity | Opinion  At its best, however, crypto is about financial inclusion. Decentralized finance, bitcoin and the myriad ways blockchain is being deployed all share a common aim: removing gatekeepers and expanding access.  This means that crypto, by default but not always in practice, tolerates the good and the bad. It’s a machine that anyone can run, no matter their objectives. This is a radical view of tolerance, one that is at the center of the American experiment with free and open speech and association protected by the First Amendment.  But that doesn’t mean the industry needs to accept Shkreli. He’s obnoxious – makes a show of drinking Chateau Lafite Rothschild wines – and a criminal. Although he said DeFi is a tool for “freedom,” it’s clear enough he’s interested primarily in building back his fortune.  Shkreli is barred for life from the pharmaceuticals industry and will not be allowed to run a publicly traded company. In her decision, the judge overseeing his trial called Shkreli a ""chaotic, dishonest and untrustworthy corporate leader"" who would likely violate the law again. He tanked at least two hedge funds, hid profits and was deceptive in his communications and deals.  Although he has called himself a Robin Hood – a capitalist willing to steal from the rich to benefit the needy – in his pharmaceutical business there’s no real reason to believe him. He’s an orator, maybe a sophist – and perhaps it’s good he’s banned from Twitter, despite the joy he may bring.  I wouldn’t want, nor is it possible, to keep Shkreli from profiting in crypto, nor should he be scapegoated for the industry’s failings. To be sure, he may also have changed. But people should consider what he builds and how he markets it when that eventually arrives.  “I bought an Enigma machine,” Shkreli once said. “I’m conflicted because it’s a Nazi relic. It’s like owning a gas chamber … but it’s a constant reminder that we should use knowledge for good, even if the process is ugly … [B]ut if you hold your nose during the process of proving it, you get to the right place.” Let the enigma act, and hopefully do no wrong.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/05/23/martin-shkreli-is-back-he-loves-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/caf9dd08d535b8f4129fb25de85c272087a589c8-2040x1360.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411459,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO4qC,1653333230,Using Crypto to Bring the Metaverse Into Reality,"The metaverse will allow us to do things we cannot do in reality, much as video games do. We can destroy things and kill people without fear of punishment or retribution. We can be risqué and push cultural and societal norms beyond traditional boundaries, cloaked by anonymity and invincibility in the metaverse. We can fly, experiment with drugs and cheat on our partners.  The metaverse will, at times, be trippy and hallucinogenic. We can live our best, most ideal lives in a body-like avatar and quickly revert back to our real lives without changing physical locations. We can parachute in and out of this world in seconds, seamlessly interweaving multiple different realities into the natural rhythms of our lives.Janine Yorio is CEO of Everyrealm, a metaverse-focused innovation firm and investment fund.  Janine Yorio is CEO of Everyrealm, a metaverse-focused innovation firm and investment fund. Zach Hungate is director of gaming at Everyrealm, a metaverse innovation and investment company. This article is part of ""Metaverse Week"" and is the second part to a two-part series.  Crypto will become an invisible, infrastructure layer that facilitates micropayments and secondary sales, making it easier to move money from inside and outside metaverses and games. There will be many metaverse tokens, but there is likely to be one super currency that can be used in nearly all of them – likely a USD-pegged stablecoin.  Tokens are fundamental to a decentralized metaverse because they solve problems like fluctuating exchange rates between local currencies, political issues like sanctions and because they allow the exchange of goods to stay within the metaverse. Having to go transact outside of the metaverse or verify or regulate transactions through middlemen will reduce this world's economic capabilities.  Crypto-based economies will therefore create real jobs that pay well enough to supplement or even replace traditional sources of employment.  The real metaverse  Just like there is no one internet, there is no single metaverse. Current platforms, such as Decentraland, have benefited from the recent wave of interest in metaverse technology, but Decentraland is more of a proof-of-concept of the addictive and superior experiences the metaverse has on offer. Shopping in Decentraland today is arguably worse than shopping on Amazon. Music concerts in Decentraland are arguably worse than they are on Zoom.  That is because Decentraland is mostly an attempt to create a digital twin of the real world, building spaces that simulate experiences we already have offline but in novel ways.  Decentraland’s vision for the metaverse is missing a few key elements: high quality, addictive video games and content; high quality visuals; strong communities; and activities that we cannot easily replicate in real life.  NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, will be important to the metaverse but not as important as they currently seem. In fact, the metaverse will give NFTs utility, not the other way around. Once mainstream, the metaverse’s economies will dwarf the size of the current $35 billion NFT market.  See also: Bringing NFTs to Life in the Metaverse  About 30 million people hold NFTs in their wallets today. However, more than 250 million people play video games and 4 billion people use social media – two experiences at the center of the metaverse. In terms of valuing the metaverse using NFTs, these tokens are to the metaverse as the tail is to the dog.  There are many innovations that must occur between now and when this seamless, mainstream version of the metaverse takes hold, and these are the areas we are focused on at Everyrealm.  Improved audio quality. As we learned from two years of video conference calls, audio quality is a critical component to online socialization. You may have noticed that your brain feels more fatigued after a day of Zoom than it does after a day of conversations in real life. That is because audio on Zoom experiences what is called “packet loss” which is what happens when packets of data fail to reach their destination across the network. This occurs for a number of reasons, mainly network congestion. Crosstalk and spatial audio, the audio styles utilized in Gather.town, make for a more natural, intuitive and engaging audio experience for players. We are excited to see how audio experiences can improve, potentially to the point where music concerts are truly engaging. This is both a hardware and a software issue, and solutions will need to take both into account.  Better UX. The metaverse must have a pleasant user interface, one that allows players to join from mobile and seamlessly, without a hitch, transfer to a PC without hindering gameplay experience and user features.  Higher numbers of concurrent players. Most multiplayer games that exist today are limited by the number of users who can participate at the same time. For example, the seminal Ariana Grande concert in Fortnite that was seen by nearly 80 million people, actually happened on the private Rift server. That is because current game engine solutions such as Unity and Unreal Engine don't allow for massive player instances that future metaverse projects will solve. The metaverse will have one instance in which up to 5,000 people (and potentially more) can huddle in the same area of a game without network or latency issues, creating a more immersive and engaging experience for everyone involved.  NPCs, or nonplaying characters in the metaverse will act with emotion that seems more real and lifelike. This will occur through more advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology, designed to recognize traces of emotion in text, voice and emoji chats.  Photo-real graphics. The metaverse will most likely be built in Unity or on the Unreal Engine, with high fidelity graphics, but this will need to be balanced alongside hardware requirements and Wi-Fi and internet quality limitations.  Wallets. To drive further Web 3 and metaverse adoption, users require frictionless onboarding that starts with a friendly user interface that is also intuitive and gamified. Wallet onboarding should feel as frictionless as Web 2 logins in order to allow people to participate as quickly as possible without delay.  Financial microtransactions on the blockchain and reduced transaction (gas) fees will enable high rates of transactions and are a prerequisite for a seamless metaverse experience. We are seeing an increasing number of games building on alternate blockchains from Ethereum such as Avalanche, Polygon and Solana because these alternate blockchains offer higher transaction speed and lower transaction costs. We expect even more refinement in this area, and change appears to be happening quickly.  Security. Security and decentralization are of the utmost importance in blockchain-based metaverse and gaming products. Developers are actively reducing the risk of breaches and hacks by building and integrating with reliable, high-validator blockchains that are truly decentralized and distributed.  Metaverse and blockchain interoperability. The future is multichain! A multichain future is the goal within the blockchain community, but we aren't there yet. Today, blockchains are not directly integrated and require bridges to transfer assets from one another. Bridges have been the primary cause of several hacks as there has been over $1 billion in bridge-related hacks in just over a year.  DAOs. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) will govern the metaverse, and DAO tooling will simplify governance and formation of these systems. Users will control metaverse protocols through active governance within DAOs. While the DAO model is often thought as the future of corporations, there is an inherent lack of tooling to make this thesis a reality today.  Hardware improvements. In order to experience a truly immersive metaverse product with photorealistic graphics, developers must use a platform such as Unreal Engine 5 and hardware improvements are a must. Metaverse products and games today are low fidelity and only run on web browsers. This is a current limitation, and the future metaverse product offerings that users will come to love will likely require hardware improvements, such as medium-tier graphics processing units/central processing units (GPUs/CPUs).

42374656,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1pEz,1653325526,"Amid Market Downturn, ‘Goblintown’ NFTs Have Their Moment","As the non-fungible token (NFT) market continues its slide down, down to Goblin Town, an NFT collection of a similar theme has caught fire.  The collection, Goblintown.wtf, clocked 3,800 ETH (around $7 million) in sales volume over the weekend, the most of any project during that time.  The “Goblin Town” theme is a crypto colloquialism for the bear market, with both the NFT sector and crypto market at large being hit hard in recent weeks.  Part of the collection’s popularity stems from its unconventional genesis. With little marketing hype or anticipation, the entire collection was free to mint and doesn’t yet have a Discord.  “No roadmap. No Discord. No utility,” the project’s website reads. “Contract wasn't actually written by goblins.”  Perhaps casting doubt on the website’s claim, when reached via Twitter DM, the team behind the project replied only in goblin: “ₜₕᵤᵣ ₐᵣ ₘₐₙₑₑ gₒₒbₗᵢₙₛ ₐₗₗ ₐᵣₒᵤₙd ᵤₛ wₑ ₐᵣ ₐₗₗ dₒwₙ dₒwₙ.”  The collection’s floor peaked yesterday at 0.75 ETH (around $1,500), though prices have since cooled off to 0.51 ETH ($1,060) for the cheapest editions.  The project also received a boost from a Sunday Bud Light tweet using its goblin-native language.  More than meets the eye?  With the collection’s success being so immediate and seemingly well coordinated, many speculate a more established team may be behind the scenes.  Some NFT sleuths have even floated the idea of Yuga Labs being involved, though moderators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT Discord have denied the connection. Yuga Labs did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  The project’s success could be reflective of the NFT market still having some juice left in it, despite overall sales volumes trending down.  Another popular release this weekend was Oddities, a Moonbirds airdrop that saw similar volume numbers to Goblintown.wtf and now boasts a 3 ETH (around $6,000) price floor.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | AIRDROP,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/23/amid-market-downturn-goblintown-nfts-have-their-moment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c7842ff1067fa0b6dc6d48e0f2ce11f6e16709e-1159x957.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

What had been one of the most successful cryptocurrencies in the market had quickly turned sour. The digital asset had fallen from trading around the $100 level to trading a couple of zeros below $1, causing holders to lose billions of dollars. Nevertheless, a lot of investors continue to hold out hope and trade the coin, which has led to multiple rallies. Up 100% In One Day On Sunday, LUNA had recorded one of its most successful days since the crash. After falling to $0.0001, it had promptly rallied once more as the daily trading volume had ramped up. This saw the digital asset hit as high as $0.0002 before the end of Sunday. The 100% had no doubt sparked more interest from crypto investors that had seen more people move into the digital asset.

CoinShares reported the value of assets under management held by digital-asset funds dropped to $38 billion, as investors pulled out some $143 million during the week through May 20. It was the year's second-largest outflow.  ""Confidence in crypto has been flailing given both retail and institutional investors that got into crypto over the past year are deeply in the red,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the trading platform Oanda.  It was a wild swing from the mood just two weeks ago, when investors inflows rose to a 2022 high, apparently buying the market dip amid the implosion of the Terra blockchain's LUNA token and its UST stablecoin.  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency crashed to as low as $25,892 on the week of May 9, the lowest since December 2020. Since then, bitcoin has recovered somewhat and stabilized around the $30,000 level. As of press time it was changing hands around $30,223.  Investors diversify from bitcoin  Bitcoin-focused funds suffered the lion's share of the outflows, with $154 million in outflows last week, shedding about the half of the $299 million inflows netted during the prior week.  Funds managed by Purpose, a fund provider that manages the largest bitcoin exchange-traded fund in North America, saw $150 million in outflows.  Some $154 million flowed out of North American crypto funds, while the funds listed in Europe brought in $12 million.  On a positive note, multi-asset funds – funds that hold multiple cryptocurrencies – stacked up $9.7 million in inflows last week. These types funds might be winners from the volatility in crypto markets as investors look to diversify their holdings, with $185 million in inflows since the start of the year.  ""We believe investors see multi-asset investments products as safer relative to single-line investment products during volatile periods,"" James Butterfill, CoinShares head of research, said in a note.  Funds that focus on altcoins – other cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin – didn't see significant flows in any direction.

42417144,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3h7,1653321065,How the Metaverse Could Be a Game-Changer for NFT Gaming,"One of the most enduring legends in the cryptocurrency industry is that Vitalik Buterin started Ethereum because his warlock got nerfed.  “I happily played World of Warcraft during 2007-2010,” Vitalik wrote in one version of the story. “But one day Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock's Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit.”  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Metaverse Week  The tale is a broad allegory for the power of decentralization. If a game skill or item was an immutable blockchain token – what we would now call a non-fungible token (NFT) ­– a company like Blizzard Entertainment couldn’t nerf, or weaken, your Siphon Life even if it wanted to. This suggests a further possibility: Because non-fungible tokens live on public blockchains, they can be read by any game’s software. If Siphon Life was an NFT that lived on a public blockchain, there was a possible future in which you could use it not just in World of Warcraft but in Assassin’s Creed or Uncharted or, who knows, Tetris.  Vitalik would have been about 16 at the time this happened, and the story is more of a winking goof (“I cried myself to sleep”?) than a serious design proposal. But it has been taken quite literally by some as a call for games built using immutable tokens to represent skills or equipment. Several rough World of Warcraft equivalents proposed to do exactly that during the 2017-2018 initial coin offering bubble, selling things like virtual swords and armor before even building the game.  But challenges to the “non-fungible item” framework are becoming increasingly apparent. Newer blockchain gaming projects, such as Ember Hearts and Mirandus, have dropped the idea. There’s generally muted enthusiasm for the concept among leaders in blockchain gaming, and little motive for traditional gaming studios to move toward interoperability. It seems less and less likely that you’ll be using a bow and arrow from Horizon: Zero Dawn in Counterstrike anytime soon.  But the rise of the “metaverse” concept has opened new possibilities. Rather than NFT interoperability across games, pioneers increasingly see a bottom-up model that will have games emerging from NFT ecosystems: think races between CryptoKitties or platform-jumping Bored Apes.  So while Vitalik’s warlock might not be safe from the nerf bat, NFT-based game assets could become something even stranger.  Why game on the blockchain?  “A week or two after Elden Ring came out, I started getting YouTube ads for rune marketplaces,” said Carlos Perierra, an investor at Bitkraft Ventures. Runes are the currency of Elden Ring, a massive hit whose multiplayer features enable item trading or selling. But these are risky markets.  Read More: The Metaverse Will Make Gamers of Us All  “You have to go into PVP [player versus player] mode, and the seller drops the runes for you,” Perierra explains of the current convoluted process for Elden Ring rune buyers. “These behaviors have existed for a very long time but you have to go into the gray market, and it can be scammy. So why don't we try and make it more scalable and efficient?”  That’s the most fundamental argument for the potential of using blockchains to track virtual items: Items are already being bought and sold at a furious pace, in ways that often leave players vulnerable. Transferring cosmetic items such as weapon “skins” between players is already a multibillion-dollar industry (yes, seriously), including a lot of active trading and speculation. The practice emerged without the support of game developers and only a few, such as Valve, have moved to legitimize and shape the markets.  NFTs could make buying and selling cosmetics or other items much easier and safer for players, while helping developers capture more of the value of their creations. Valve, which has authorized skin trading in games like Counterstrike: Global Offensive, generates tens of millions of dollars in revenue for itself and for independent skin designers.  But Valve can control and foster that market in large part because it owns the omnipresent digital games marketplace Steam. Items for other games are also sold through the portal, but Valve takes a hefty 30% cut from third-party sales. Such fees are one reason item sellers for games like Elden Ring or World of Warcraft often use awkward, unofficial workarounds – methods that also leave players vulnerable to getting scammed by dishonest sellers.  The ‘pay to win’ problem  At the same time, there’s a pretty good reason these markets aren’t official: While many players clearly love them, others very vocally do not. In multiplayer games in particular, players often regard winning rare and powerful items as an achievement and see real-money item sales as essentially a form of cheating that devalues their in-game accomplishments.  This is particularly true of items that make a character more powerful or competitive: games that formalize real-money sales of powerful items are often derided as “pay to win.” That’s one reason making powerful game items into NFTs isn’t necessarily a slam dunk. It would make any game that adopted the model “pay to win.”  Read More: Decentraland for Beginners: How to Get Started in Decentraland  Making skills or items immutable even within a single game is probably a nonstarter for related design reasons. Many games now have multiplayer elements, and character abilities often have to be tweaked so that competition is fairer. While a teenaged Vitalik was frustrated by losing power, nerfing Siphon Life made the game more fun for other players – and World of Warcraft’s success after Vitalik quit suggests that Blizzard actually got this and similar tweaks more or less correct. (Sorry, Vitalik.)  Cross-platform transferability would also present balance and player-experience issues for designers. An NFT is little more than a marker of ownership, and wouldn’t define the actual utility of game items in any consistent way. For instance, there’s no reason an NFT of a sword that’s moderately powerful in one game couldn’t be made completely overpowering in another. “Even if we agree that we’re totally okay with interoperability, if I as the developer open the walled garden, it’s still very complicated,” says Pereira. “It starts getting a lot harder a lot faster.”  There are also challenges at the level of the graphical interface. 3D visual assets for games can be created with a variety of design tools such as Unreal or Unity. ​​“These things have proprietary data formats that are linked to particular rendering engines,” says Joel Dietz, CEO and founder of the MetaMetaverse platform. “ It’s not an easy thing to make them work together.” With MetaMetaverse, Dietz said, one goal is to enable that interoperability for assets across engines..  Much of this complexity could be moderated if there were enough industry coordination, for instance around developing standards for interoperability.  “That’s the Holy Grail, that’s the dream,” said Ahmed Al-Balaghi, CEO and co-founder of Biconomy, which builds infrastructure for blockchain games. “But who’s going to create those standards?” The player with the most potential to lead that effort may have squandered its position: “Meta can’t lead on standards,” Al-Balaghi says of the behemoth formerly known as Facebook, “given all the blowback they’ve gotten.”  But the biggest problem may be finding workable business models for NFT items, which completely upends the way many game publishers make money. “From a business perspective, [traditional developers] are selling in-game items right now that people are happy to buy, and they’re not expecting a reward.” That may be a disincentive to tokenizing items, and a big reason Al-Balaghi says widespread interoperability of game items is “very far in the future.”  But it’s not clear the incentives are much different for some current Web 3-centric projects. Many have spent the last year or two pursuing branded partnerships with celebrities and deals with designers. A major goal of those deals is to attract users to a particular platform, so making assets interoperable might not be appealing.  “Sandbox is paying a lot of people to develop on Sandbox,” said Dietz. “So even if the item would work somewhere else, I bet they would have defensive licensing to keep that from happening. That’s a hard thing to battle against if you’re pushing the interoperability thing.”  Build Back Backwards  The project that has triggered the most discussion about NFTs representing in-game items is probably Loot, an NFT series launched in August 2021 by Dom Hoffman, who previously founded pre-TikTok video app Vine. Loot NFTs are extremely minimalistic: Each is just a list of adventuring gear like wands and cloaks. The idea that people paid thousands of dollars for these black-and-white text blocks was greeted with disbelief by the general public, not least because it came in the midst of a broadly irrational NFT craze. And Loot prices have indeed dropped along with the rest of the market.  But conceptually, Loot has to be counted among the most interesting NFT projects yet. As Hoffman tweeted at the time, the Loot NFTs have “no images or stats” because those are “intentionally omitted for others to interpret.” The broad idea was that items could be created by one entity, then the game would be built on top of the items – an inversion of the usual process.  The Loot experiment hasn’t produced a notable game yet, and it may ultimately be more of a statement of purpose than becoming a platform for games itself. But the general idea proved compelling and practical well before the current NFT or metaverse crazes.  “The big aha moment for us with CryptoKitties is that within a couple of months, we had 60 different apps that built things for the Kitties,” says Mik Naayem, chief business office at Dapper Labs. “Kitty hats, kitty races.” This was way back in late 2017, when CryptoKitties became the first huge NFT fad (so huge it broke Ethereum). The racing game Naayem is referring to was KittyRace, a very simple, two-dimensional track where owners could race their Kitties. Naayem still sees that as a much stronger model for NFTs in gaming than simply tokenizing in-game items.  “The idea that you’re going to take something from World of Warcraft and put it in Need for Speed, that’s probably not going to happen,” he said. “But the instant you have a big enough community around an asset, game developers will start building around it because there’s an audience.”  That’s roughly what has happened with the most popular NFTs of the past few years. In April, Bored Ape Yacht Club creators Yuga Labs announced a virtual environment called Otherside. Not just BAYCs but also CryptoPunks, Meebits and other collections owned by Yuga will reportedly be importable as playable avatars. That’s distinct from what happened with CryptoKitties because the game is being built by the same people who made the NFTs. But it demonstrates the basic premise that NFT “items” can serve as the foundation for games rather than being created for a game.  The fact that Otherside is an entire, immersive “metaverse” is also different from the early, small-scale CryptoKitties add-ons. The rise of such virtual worlds over the past four or five years has considerably shifted the conversation about blockchain gaming. And just as Otherside is more vertically integrated than KittyRaces, metaverses may offer a more streamlined, if less radical, vision of NFT-based gaming.  Read More: NFTs in the Metaverse: How to Earn Money With Unique Assets  For Charles Smith, CEO of metaverse project Nifty Island, the most important model is the children’s game Roblox, in which a large world is populated with minigames, mostly created by users.  “Roblox is the first stab at being the YouTube of gaming,” says Smith. “Individual games in Roblox at any time have more DAUs [daily active users] than most [big-budget game] titles. The other studios are still acting like old Hollywood, [but] the future is definitely small developers” building narrow experiences within a shared environment.  That would make interoperability of a limited sort fairly easy because one controlling entity can set the parameters for how items work within the broader world and transfer between games. Another significant factor is that games are being built across a variety of blockchain ecosystems and technical interoperability on the back end is still something of an unknown, so keeping things confined to one chain is likely more practical right now.  “Having different experiences within one ecosystem will see more success,” said Al-Balaghi, at least in the short term. “It’s easier to spin up, it’s easier to go to market.” But he said those self-contained worlds could become a platform for greater openness if users push for it. “Developers have to be convinced to change the code to be interoperable. Do the guardians of these semi-open systems want to be fully open?”  That’s the most specific roadmap to the future of interoperable gaming I heard while reporting this story. But it echoes a more general sentiment: While the theoretical possibilities of using blockchain assets for gaming are significant, making good games is the real key. No blockchain game has really taken off among users so far except for so-called “play to earn” games that foreground financial elements rather than gameplay.  The looming bear market may be a better environment for focusing on substance, exploring new NFT-based models and attracting players who are interested in more than just watching numbers go up.

Lockheed and Filecoin plan to identify a satellite or other space-faring platform that can hold the technology to operate an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) node, identify that platform's needs and try and identify a test mission.  IPFS is an open-source data storage and sharing protocol aimed at speeding up data downloads by letting network participants hold or share information. The idea is to reduce latency when downloading data from remote locations, such as the moon, said Marta Belcher, the head of policy and general counsel at Protocol Labs.  Protocol Labs, a key player in the Filecoin ecosystem, is the original developer behind IPFS' code.  ""[We're] redesigning a lot of the technologies [that] just aren't ready to work in space,"" Belcher said at Monday's event.  Joe Landon, vice president of advanced programs development at Lockheed, said the move is meant to anticipate an emerging ""space economy.""  ""In the future, we'll have one satellite refueling another. That's a transaction that takes place entirely in space that doesn't really have a nexus back on Earth. Decentralization makes sense for that,"" Landon said.  Moreover, at present, satellites interact mainly with servers on Earth, but the vast distances of space mean instructions sent to objects orbiting the moon or Mars won't arrive for several minutes. That could be forever if urgent instructions or data needs to be shared.

42411454,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO4Zf,1653318314,The Metaverse Will Make Gamers of Us All,"​​In his seminal novel “Ready Player One,” author Ernest Cline describes a grandiose virtual reality where people spend the majority of their time, offering an escape from a reality battered by social, economic and political strife.  This is a world where digital currency is more stable than fiat and players can assume any identity they can imagine. A world that is being built today.  Janine Yorio is head of real estate at Republic, an online investment platform for individual investors. Zach Hungate is director of gaming at Everyrealm, a metaverse innovation and investment company. This article is part of ""Metaverse Week,"" and is the first part to a two-part series.  In a few years, we will wonder how we ever lived without the metaverse, much as we already do about the internet. Fundamentally, the metaverse consolidates the digital elements of our life – video games, social media, messaging, e-commerce – into a comprehensive experience.  Through a vast system of interconnected networks, 2D websites will become 3D web spaces that are interactive, immersive and social. Rather than scrolling through web pages, you’ll be cognizant of others engaging with the same content simultaneously as we congregate to play, shop, talk and search together.  The metaverse has an opportunity to be a more productive and socially redeeming internet. It's also incredibly game-like, and offers real economic opportunities for developers versed with building inhabitable worlds. In other words, game developers.  The actual platform or virtual world in which communities form will take a back seat, becoming an invisible infrastructure layer, much as websites are now hosted on AWS or Google Cloud.  Instead, users will choose a metaverse platform based on ease of use, technical capabilities and quality of content. Creators that master the production of metaverse content or developers who build tools that make it easy for mainstream users to create and distribute their own metaverse content will attract the most users and therefore build the most valuable platforms.  Users will come for the content (events, shows, esports) but they will stay for the social connections fostered through shared gaming experiences.  It will allow people currently forced to hide their real identities due to cultural norms in their physical environment to flourish and showcase their individuality online. Perceived physical disabilities will no longer preclude participation and the lack of a common language won’t prevent communication.  Dismantling physical barriers will create a positive feedback loop that will propel the entire metaverse. Communities are always centers of innovation, and that will be true in our shared digital spaces. The metaverse will be self-fulfilling if it is personally fulfilling.  The metaverse will also become our primary form of procrastination, just as the internet has consumed our free moments. We will use it casually, sneaking a few moments here and there when we can, but we will also settle in for longer stretches of time when our schedule permits (or perhaps when it doesn’t, to the detriment of our real lives and obligations).  See also: How the Metaverse Could Be a Game-Changer for NFT Gaming  However, the metaverse may be more mundane than we are expecting to be. Rather than a sci-fi, futuristic and dystopian version of the world, the metaverse is likely to look a lot like the real world.  We know this because people who are spending time in the metaverse already (on platforms like IMVU, High Rise Second Life and Fortnite) generally buy clothing that resembles street clothes and build houses that look pretty ordinary.  While the metaverse allows for futuristic versions of reality, the human mind may prefer to live in an environment that is mostly evocative of the one it already knows best. We may all live our best lives in the metaverse, but that version may look pretty familiar to us.  Diversity and community building in the metaverse  The metaverse will be equally appealing to all genders. The metaverse will transcend cultures and geographic borders. The metaverse will be a home for people who want to play games, produce music, socialize or just people watch. Because there is a place in the metaverse for everyone, it will be a locus of culture for generations to come as well as an economic engine. Big and small brands can find their way to respective audiences and enhance their digital identity.  New brands being built and that will be built in the metaverse have a unique opportunity and could one day rival and become more successful than the global brands today. The most well-known brands in the metaverse currently are Bored Ape Yacht Club, RTFKT, Genies and Zed Run, to name a few. You may be unfamiliar with some of these brands, and that speaks to our point.  The metaverse and Web 3 are ushering in a new wave of doing business. In some sense, the Web 3 community sees big, corporate brands as anathema to the crypto ethos, which values community, evangelists and profit sharing. The metaverse has its own brands that connote authenticity and quality. Many of these brands are very new, but are already truly global and have rabid, cult-like fanbases.  There's an opportunity to do things differently. Economics should serve people rather than the other way around – the central premise of crypto.  The most valuable brands will likely be born in the metaverse and are metaverse-native, and corporations know this. Nike (NKE), for instance, acquired digital sneaker company RTFKT as part of its metaverse play. Said differently, one of the world's most powerful brands did not enter the metaverse with its existing brand but purchased a young metaverse-native company to gain exposure to this next-gen internet.  Fundamentally a game  One thing we’re likely to all do together in the metaverse is play video games. That is the primary activity that will bring us there the first time, and then have us coming back over and over and over again.  And, in some ways, a version of this reality has already arrived. Children around the world have spent the last decade completely engulfed in the internet. They spend time in interactive environments where they play games, socialize with friends, build small businesses, and buy and sell things.  Video games, in particular, have become a primary form of socialization. This “metaverse generation” (encompassing children up to age 18 today) has very different expectations from technology – even compared to millennials.  For them, Meta's (FB) Facebook is truly for the geriatric set. TikTok is interesting, but perhaps not interactive enough. Netflix (NFLX) is something you do when you want to spend time with your parents. YouTube’s short-form, always-on, community-developed content has replaced scheduled television programming.  Today’s youth are as addicted to technology as their parents, but consuming it in a new way.  The coming set of metaverse video games will not be after-thoughts or mini games but the main piece de resistance. Games might look entirely different.  Not all games will be first-person shooters like Fortnite or Valorant. Sometimes we will play old-school arcade games that resemble Super Mario Brothers or Pac Man. Other times we will procrastinate with more mindless pattern games like Candy Crush or build worlds like the Sims or Second Life.  The video games we play in the metaverse will be of an extremely high quality, often built by AAA gaming studios, and they will keep us coming back for more. They may also be built on the blockchain. Today, blockchain-enabled games and blockchain games are in the infancy of development – there are few titles, and blockchain infrastructure itself is still being developed.  See also: Bringing NFTs to Life in the Metaverse  Likewise, video game developers are likely to be the primary designers of the metaverse because at its core the metaverse is a video game. Video game developers are typically among the best and brightest graduates of computer science educational programs because video game development is highly complex; the person writing the code must think in 3D.  When a person turns a door knob in the metaverse, the door swings open. That is not just a 3D architectural model, but a world with cause and effect – and few coders outside of gaming studios know how to program that world.  These developers cannot be created rapidly in coding schools the way that HTML developers are, which means there will be a greater demand for game development talent from remote locations and emerging markets, causing a new economic opportunity for those who are crafty enough to teach themselves game development.  In some ways, the metaverse is evolving rapidly, but in other ways the rate of improvement feels almost glacial. It is important to remember that this new environment consists of robust and highly customizable video game worlds, and those take a long time to develop and test appropriately.  We are encouraged by the wave of new entrants into the field, and believe that the metaverse that we are all hoping for will evolve and ship much more quickly than previous technological innovations.

42417142,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3f3,1653317941,Metaverse Real Estate – Next Big Thing or Next Big Boondoggle?,"Are you hoping to buy a home but frustrated with the sky-high prices? Are you worried the housing market is in a bubble?  Then consider a lovely piece of real estate that goes for only $4,873, as of the time of this writing. No HOA fees. No noisy neighbors. And you might even qualify for a mortgage. It’s a beautiful plot of land called “Parcel 148, -35,” and the only catch is that it exists solely in the digital metaverse of Decentraland.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Metaverse Week series.  Metaverse real estate is booming, or at least it has for much of the crypto bull run, topping $500 million in 2021. (Where it goes now is anyone’s guess.) In The Sandbox, someone spent $450,000 to buy land next to to Snoop Dogg’s virtual “Snoopverse.” Tokens.com spent over $2 million on virtual land and has formed a metaverse real estate company. And now you can even get a metaverse mortgage, kind of. (More on that soon.)  Why do people buy land in the metaverse?  Almost everything in crypto, of course, has a whiff of the absurd. But especially for those not paying close attention to the space, the idea of “digital real estate” can seem particularly bonkers.  The short answer: People think the price of metaverse land will go up. And so far, for many, this has been a good bet. One reason is the forced scarcity. Just as bitcoin’s (BTC) total supply is capped at 21 million, there are only 90,601 parcels in Decentraland. “If it becomes a place where millions of people are hanging out, land will continue to appreciate. Supply and demand,” says Dan Reitzik, CEO of metaverse real-estate company Terrazero, which now has 30 employees.  Read More: Location, Location, Location: Investing in Real Estate in the Metaverse  The longer answer has to do with virtual Miller Lite.  Unlike when you buy many cryptocurrencies, when you buy virtual real estate, you can actually do stuff with it. You can build games on it. Display advertisements on it. Flaunt your non-fungible tokens (NFT) on it. Host a virtual Kendrick Lamar concert on it. Or even rent it out to others who need the digital space. All of these activities could bring you passive income.  And this is where the beer comes in. At halftime of the most recent Super Bowl, Miller Lite opened a virtual bar in Decentraland. Dan Reitzik’s company helped that come to life and “20,000 to 30,000 avatars visited over the day,” says Reitzik, who adds “the average length of time that each person interacted with Miller in the bar was 23 minutes, which in marketing is incredible.” As I’ve written about before, brands ranging from Adidas to Clinique to Fidelity are all trying to “enter the metaverse.” Many think the trend will continue. And when brands want to set up virtual shops to interact with customers, as Reitzik says, “in order to do that, the brands need to own land or rent land.”  With virtual land, if you’re willing to put in the time and effort, you can actually boost its value, similar to how in the real world, you can renovate a fixer-upper. “You can impact the future value of that asset [virtual land] by building on top of it, and that’s very different from a traditional crypto token,” says Janine Yorio, CEO of Everyrealm, a metaverse real estate company. “You’re limited really only by your own creativity and the technical limitations of the platform.”  Decentraland’s head of partnerships, Adam de Cata, says these kinds of developments are popping up all over the virtual world. “There are 5,000 parcels within Vegas City,’’ says de Cata, “and they’ve been able to host the Australian Open.”  Maybe this intrigues you. Maybe you want to invest. Maybe you can’t afford to buy any metaverse land but you’re keen to take out a mortgage.  Mortgages in the metaverse  It was Dan Reitzik’s company, Terrazero, that first offered a metaverse mortgage, leading to a flurry of mainstream headlines like Curbed’s “Now you can get a mortgage in the metaverse.” When I heard this I immediately thought of my colleague David Morris’s prescient article from 2018, “For the Love of All That is Holy, Do Not Take Out a Crypto-Mortgage on Virtual Land.” The idea sounded reckless. It’s one thing to toss a small slice of your investable assets on a risky bet with a high upside. It’s something else to buy virtual land with money you don’t have. Especially in the wake of the Terra system meltdown, it’s not hard to imagine an interlocking, highly leveraged system of metaverse mortgages that sinks the crypto economy, 2008-style.  Read More: How to Invest in the Metaverse  Reitzik acknowledges that the provocative headline of “Metaverse Mortgage” is “the reason we’re on Bloomberg all the time,” but quickly clarifies that “when we launched the metaverse mortgages, we didn’t launch it to provide an opportunity for people to speculate.” He says the first mortgage was to a young entrepreneur who wanted to purchase four plots of land, and he had a specific business plan for deploying advertising boards which would generate revenue.  “We looked at it and said that this business is viable,” says Reitzik. “We gave him a two-year loan. It’s not really a mortgage.” Terrazero purchased the parcel on behalf of the client, then held the NFT (when you buy land it’s really just an NFT), and then granted him the development rights on that land. “He can build his dream, make his money and pay us off. And once he pays us off, he owns the land,” explains Reitzik. As soon as the news of the mortgage went public, Terrazero received “thousands of inquiries.” Most were for raw speculation. Reitzik ignored all of these. As he says now, “We don’t want to create a new 2008 for the metaverse.”  Even putting mortgages aside, metaverse real estate involves some sneaky risks that you don’t find in the real world. The first one is platform risk. In the real world, if you’re pondering a real-estate purchase, at the very least, you have confidence that in five or 10 years the plot of land will actually exist. Maybe that fringe-y neighborhood in Queens, N.Y., fails to appreciate as you had hoped, but it won’t simply vanish from the map.  That’s not the case in the metaverse. You’re not just betting on some pixels in Decentraland, you’re betting that Decentraland itself will still be relevant in the future. But what if Decentraland goes the way of MySpace and all the energy flows to The Sandbox? Or what if a new metaverse emerges that makes both of these obsolete?  This is why Yorio’s company – now with a team of 45 – invests in a portfolio of 27 metaverses and is tracking “a couple hundred,” including virtual worlds that haven’t even launched. Suddenly the company’s name “Everyrealm” makes sense. “You have to look at it like a VC would,” says Yorio, meaning that she’s assessing early-stage startups. “We’re looking at the team. Do they have a track record of having built something similar?” Other questions she asks: Do they know how to go to market and bring users to a platform? Do they have a unique idea? Do they understand video game mechanics?  Then there’s the tricky issue of teleportation, which is not something you think about when buying a condo in Nashville. In Decentraland, as with some other metaverses (each one is different), you can simply punch in coordinates and teleport to a location. This scrambles the normal real-estate playbook. “I don’t think the old adage of location, location, location matters as much,” says Yorio. “It matters what you build on it.”  Reitzik agrees. “Location isn’t quite as important as in the real world. What is important is that you have traffic and people are engaged.” This is why both Terrazero and Everyrealm aren’t just scooping up land and hoping it appreciates; they’re actually “developing” that land to entice more traffic. “We focus on investing, and then also thinking about how we can be productive and helpful members of the community, so that it isn’t just a wasteland of barren land,” says Yorio. “And in that sense, it is just like real-life real estate.”  Read More: Matthew Ball: Metaverse Man  Or some see it as even superior. “In the real world, I can put 20,000 people in Rogers Arena [in Vancouver] to watch a Drake concert,” says Reitzik. “But in the metaverse we could put 20 million people in there. Think about the opportunity for generating revenue and commerce based on the scalability of a virtual world.”  Nearly all of this, of course, relies on one foundational assumption: That people will care about the metaverse. And that, in turn, is effectively a bet on the growth of crypto. If the metaverse flops, your “land” is worthless. At least in the real world, if you buy a home and the market tanks, you still have four walls and a ceiling to shelter you from storms. If you splurged for Parcel 148, -35 and the market tanks, you just have a sad collection of pixels.  Is metaverse real estate speculation crazy?  I ask that of Decentraland’s de Cata. “My response is that it’s okay not to understand different communities,” says de Cata. He acknowledges that it’s not for everyone, and that “even digital ownership sounds so far from what the average person [is thinking about.]” But then again, the ethos of building a decentralized metaverse, says de Cata, is that a community is working to create content that will be owned by the users. If the metaverse is the future and we’ll all be spending more time in it, shouldn’t the land itself be owned by the users, as opposed to Big Tech?  In some sense, says de Cata, the metaverse is “no different from most other social platforms that they may use on a day-to-day basis,” such as Twitter or Facebook or Instagram. And if you suspect the metaverse today is where social media was in 2007, maybe it’s not so crazy to buy a chunk of Harvard-era Facebook.  But think twice about that mortgage.

Attendees of the June 9-12 festival in Austin, Texas, will be able to earn DESK by doing such things as picking up their badges at registration, visiting exhibitor booths or joining CoinDesk’s rebooted Discord server. The token will be redeemable at the event for merchandise (e.g., T-shirts or hoodies), food or beverages from Austin vendors that have partnered with us, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other rewards.  The big idea is to use tokenomics to build a loyal, engaged community by providing the audience with incentives to interact with CoinDesk’s content – and with one another. It will also give attendees who are new to crypto a way to learn about blockchain technology, including the experience of setting up and maintaining a wallet, with a relatively low-stakes, nonfinancial asset.  Read more: What Is DESK? CoinDesk’s Social Token, Explained  From testnet to mainnet  CoinDesk beta-tested DESK a year ago at Consensus 2021, a virtual event. At the time, the token ran on Rinkeby, a testnet, or experimental environment for software under development, for the Ethereum blockchain.  It was a hit with attendees, who created hundreds of wallets, claimed thousands of tokens for participating in the conference and redeemed them for NFTs and other rewards. A community spontaneously formed around the product with an unofficial Discord chat and even a nickname: the piranhas.  Read more: What DESK Says About Scarcity, Value and Money (2021)  Now, CoinDesk is relaunching DESK into the wild, with the help of partners Coinvise, Flexa, and NFTify.

This is a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum that allows more and cheaper transactions by keeping them off the primary chain. CoinDesk will cover the cost of gas, or on-chain computation fees, for DESK transactions on Polygon.  Not a financial product  Importantly, DESK is not a currency, nor is it a financial asset or investment product of any kind. CoinDesk is not using DESK to raise funds; we are not selling the tokens for money. DESK is a reward token, analogous to airline frequent-flier miles, hotel guest points and the like.  Neither does DESK purport to be fully decentralized. As the creator of the token contract, CoinDesk may adjust the supply of DESK in order to encourage spending and discourage speculation or hoarding. The company reserves the right to delete the CoinDesk account and/or blacklist addresses of users that try to list the token on exchanges or otherwise undermine the purpose of DESK.  That said, DESK is a blockchain token. Users will need to set up a crypto wallet that works with Polygon (MetaMask is a beginner-friendly option) to claim and redeem it. Subject to the possible restrictions mentioned above, users will maintain full control of their DESK and can transfer it to whomever they want.

42411114,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gizUQW,1653316242,"Deplatformed by PayPal, Antiwar Journalists Speak Out","Earlier this month, we highlighted PayPal’s (PYPL) decision to ban two independent media organizations, Mint Press and Consortium, from using the payments platform. The sites are staffed by and affiliated with highly reputable journalists, and both believe they have been targeted for refusing to parrot mainstream media narratives about topics including U.S. intelligence operations and the war in Ukraine.  According to the two organizations, the PayPal ban remains in effect. PayPal had also frozen the outlets’ funds, including $9,348.14 in Consortium’s account, and threatened to seize the money as “damages.” Those funds have since been released, though Consortium chief Joe Lauria said he believes that was done only to prevent the sites from joining an ongoing class-action lawsuit against PayPal by a group of poker players whose accounts were similarly seized.  To top it all off, nobody will tell the outlets why exactly they’ve been banned.  “I've reached out to PayPal several times only to be told by a representative that they themselves don't understand or know why we have been banned,” said Mint Press founder and Editor-in-Chief Mnar Adley. CoinDesk has also reached out to PayPal multiple times seeking clarity, but PayPal has not responded to our inquiries.  This the latest in a long string of instances of financial deplatforming, which has become a constant and accelerating nuisance for a variety of controversial but legal businesses, including cannabis and adult entertainment. But compared to weed or porn, PayPal preventing journalists from making money has potentially much more serious social impacts.  That’s in part because it will directly interfere with the work of the outlets it has banned. It could also have a broader “chilling effect” on speech in general: if PayPal seems poised to ban controversial content, writers and publishers are less likely to print facts or ideas that contradict powerful mainstream institutions.  Inconvenient truths  “This is a warning shot fired at anyone even remotely antiestablishment,” said Mint Press senior writer Alan MacLeod. “Alternative media operations run on shoestring budgets and rely on enormous corporations like PayPal to operate correctly. If they can do this to us, they can do it to you.”  MacLeod, who holds a Ph.D. in geopolitics from the University of Glasgow and has published a book on disinformation with the respected academic press Routledge, is representative of the kinds of voices PayPal is helping silence here.  “I believe this is a case of ‘ideological policing,’” said Consortium editor Joe Lauria. “Indeed, this is wartime censorship even though the U.S. is not officially at war.”  Consortium and Mint Press have both recently published articles that challenge neat narratives about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. To be clear, Mint and Consortium are not peddling Russian apologism in support of an authoritarian future – Fox News has that covered. Rather, the outlets are antiwar and largely leftist, and their reporting uncovers the ugly truths that inevitably arise on both sides of any conflict.  The incident is also worrying because the PayPal bans appear coordinated, with Mint Press and Consortium receiving their smackdowns within days of each other. That strongly suggests pressure from government authorities. The bans are easy to see as a follow-up to Wikileaks’ own deplatforming from PayPal ten years ago, which came at the request of the U.S. State Department. Consortium has long been noted for its coverage of America’s relentless attacks on Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange after he helped expose American war crimes in Iraq.  Mint Press coverage also seems likely to have rubbed Western officialdom the wrong way, such as MacLeod’s recent report that TikTok employs a strangely large number of NATO-affiliated individuals. Mint Press also reports extensively on attacks on Palestine by the Israeli Defense Forces, and publishes the work of Pulitzer Prize-winning antiwar reporter Chris Hedges. In his coverage, Matt Taibbi points to a recent PayPal announcement that acknowledged sharing data with governments and law enforcement as a way to “fight extremism and hate.” Tarring criticism of Israeli policy as anti-Semitism is a frequent tactic of its allies and supporters – a category error regardless of your politics.  ‘Fake news’ that isn’t  There is an important distinction between Consortium and Mint Press on the one hand, and other sorts of outlets that have been deplatformed as clickbaity misinformation or government propaganda, on the other. Over the past six years, we’ve seen justified concern over the rise of fake viral content crafted only to generate clicks and ad views, state-backed outlets pushing official agendas on social media, and increasingly partisan rhetoric that distorts real events.  Mint Press and Consortium, by contrast, are independent but credible sources focused on careful reporting of real events, even if they’re politically uncomfortable. Both are staffed primarily by Americans, and neither takes backing from any government.  “This fight against so-called disinformation is just a guise to target dissenters and outlets that expose the profiteers and both parties’ addiction to forever wars,” said Adley. “Which is exactly what we do at Mint Press. We name the names, show their profits, highlight their statements and report on the many conflicts of interest that exist within the media and these shady relationships.”  Moreover, their staffers and contributors include many highly lauded veteran journalists. Lauria is a former staffer at the Boston Globe and Wall Street Journal, and co-authored a book with Mike Gravel, who represented Alaska as a Democrat in the Senate from 1969 to 1981. Consortium was founded in 1995 by Robert Parry, an award-winning investigative journalist who helped uncover the CIA’s role in drug trafficking and its extensive use of psychological warfare abroad. I’ve already mentioned Mint publishing Chris Hedges, who famously resigned from the New York Times after criticizing its coverage of the Iraq War – which in fact was and continued to be catastrophically flawed.  Mint and Consortium also have highly reputable supporters. Taibbi, who covered the PayPal deplatformings sympathetically, remains one of the most influential journalists of his generation for his coverage of the 2008 financial crisis, including the timeless description of Goldman Sachs as “a giant vampire squid.” Robert Scheer, who recently interviewed Lauria about the fight with PayPal, is a journalist with a half century of experience and professor of journalism at USC-Annenberg.  All this may sound like an appeal to authority or credentials, and that’s because it is. You may be a fan of Lindy effects in crypto, and it doesn’t get much more Lindy in journalism than folks like Lauria and Scheer, who have managed to maintain careers over long decades while refusing to bend to the groupthink of the media industry. They should be heroes in particular to skeptics of state power.  Financial censorship is still censorship  While both Mint and Consortium are openly antiwar, their reporting doesn’t amount to a political campaign. They are simply exposing facts that authorities would rather not have to navigate, such as the strong presence of fascist-aligned units such as the Azov Battalion in the Ukrainian war effort. By lumping such uncomfortable realities in with “fake news,” PayPaI is accepting its new role as a bottleneck for ideological control.  I would call this a sad index of American fragility, but in reality, this is just a tactical shift in response to new technology. As Joe Lauria points out, controlling the news has been part of American democracy since at least the early 20th century.  “Before the internet,” said Lauria, “It was easier to indirectly control the narrative through three TV networks or media owned later by just a handful of corporations. With social media anyone can start a publication, a webcast or reach thousands of followers on social media … The narrative is out of control from [the government’s] point of view, so they're pursuing a stringent government censorship program, first by pressuring social media giants and now directly with the Disinformation Governance Board.” (Since the interview, that board, at the Department of Homeland Security, has been mothballed.)  U.S. President “Woodrow Wilson lost by one vote in the Senate to put government censorship in the Espionage Act,” Lauria added. “His dream is now coming true.”  Luckily, there is at least one solution for these and other marginalized voices: cryptocurrency.  “We accept bitcoin [donations], which has been a great backstop” during the PayPal ban, said Adley. “The ban has reminded us that we shouldn't rely on these big tech financial giants. We will be working to add options for other cryptocurrencies as well, as it seems that we should work with a more decentralized financial option. We are still new to the cryptocurrency world, but it seems like we don't have a choice but to move this direction if we are to survive as a media business.”  Read more: Financial Censorship Is a Thing.

EBay officially announced its interest in digital collectibles earlier in May, though its CEO Jamie Iannone had teased the possibility of integrating the tech for months.  The prices of the NFTs range from $10 to $1,500, purchasable via the same fiat payment methods as the platform’s physical items. The first ones feature hockey legend Wayne Gretzky.  The collection expands on OneOf’s partnership with Sports Illustrated, which announced its own marketplace on the platform in February.  The move marks a continued push from traditional e-commerce platforms interested in blockchain. StockX, a sneaker shopping platform and eBay rival, launched its own NFT marketplace earlier this year.

42395397,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASwMtn,1653314166,First Mover Americas: Fantom Surges 20% as Sparkster Questions Fly,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price Point: Bitcoin and ether prices had a flat weekend with little movement. Fantom's FTM token surges 20% on the day.  Market Moves: Bitcoin’s four-hour time frame price chart signals upside, according to one analyst.  Feature: The seemingly dormant blockchain project Sparkster's apparent conversion of $22 million of ether into the stablecoin USDC – visible in blockhain data – is raising suspicions among some community members, CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa reports.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck trading in the $29,000-$30,000 range after an uneventful weekend. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dipped to lows of $28,900 on Saturday.  Ethereum (ETH) is up 2.8% on the day, trading at around $2,000 after experiencing a relatively flat weekend.  Altcoins mostly traded in line with BTC’s flat performance over the weekend, apart from layer 1 project Fantom (FTM), which is outperforming.  In traditional markets, stocks and the Chinese yuan advanced after President Joe Biden signaled he’d reconsider China tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. U.S. stock futures make a jump start to the week, with the Dow Futures up 340 points, S&P 500 Futures up 1.1% and the Nasdaq Futures up 1% on the day.  Market Moves  Until the next U.S. Consumer Price Index data is released (in three weeks) and the next Federal Reserve meeting, sideways movement is expected in the crypto market, according to Florian Giovannacci, head of trading at Covario AG.  Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said in an email to CoinDesk that bitcoin has printed a higher high and higher low on the four-hour time frame, which is considered a bullish indicator for continuation to the upside.  Fantom’s FTM was up 20% over the last 24-hours, making it the top performer amongst major digital assets on the day.  FTM is also up 48% over the last seven days.  Some analysts have attributed the uptick in Fantom to rumors that decentralized finance (DeFi) developer Andre Cronje might be returning to the project.

Crypto Valley Venture Capital Launches African Blockchain Early-Stage Fund The venture capital investor published a report which found funding for African blockchain startups far outpaced investment in other venture funding.  Feature: ICO-Funded Project Sparkster Converts $22M in Ether to USDC After 3 Years, No Product  By Shaurya Malwa  The conversion in recent days of nearly $22 million of ether (ETH) into the stablecoin USD coin (USDC) by the seemingly dormant blockchain project Sparkster has got some observers crying foul and calling on the funds to be blacklisted.  Bizarre narratives and ideas claiming world-changing potential peaked at the height of the initial coin offering (ICO) boom in early 2018. While some projects went on to build legitimate products and ecosystems, others have yet to deliver.  Sparkster looks to be in the latter camp. The project raised over $30 million in July 2018 in an ICO for what it described as a ""no-code"" software creation platform. The final tweet from the project’s Twitter account was in 2021 – a link to a demonstration of a supposedly upcoming product. Nothing has been communicated from that account since.  The wallets holding the proceeds from the ICO suddenly became active this weekend, however, and by Monday they were sitting on over $22 million of the stablecoin USDC. The move is seen as unusual and is raising suspicions among some community members – especially in the absence of a public explanation from the Sparkster team.

Exchanges are often targets of hackers, and even when they are not, there is always the risk that the exchange could become insolvent and you would lose your funds. Another downside of using exchanges is that they typically charge fees for each transaction. Besides, these fees can add up over time and eat into your profits if you are a frequent trader.

42395383,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASwMg1,1653310601,Goldman Sachs Says DeFi’s Interconnections Can Increase Systemic Risk,"One little-noticed effect of the terraUSD (UST) collapse relates to Lido, a liquid staking protocol, Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a report Friday, and shows how the connections between decentralized finance (DeFi) applications amplify systemic risk.  Lido is a DeFi app that allows ether (ETH) holders to set tokens aside to validate transactions while also earning yield. Investors receive a staked ether token (stETH) at a ratio of 1:1, and can use it as lending collateral or across supported trading pools, the bank said.  The collapse in UST hit stETH, with the token trading at a 4.5% discount to ETH, Goldman said. That’s because stETH holders were able to convert their tokens into bonded ether (bETH) and earn rewards on Terra’s Anchor Protocol. As a result, stETH was vulnerable to Terra blockchain halts, which impact withdrawals, according to the report.  This event is important because Lido has one-third of all staked ether deposited in it and shows how “DeFi’s compostability can theoretically increase systemic risk,” the bank said.  DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without traditional intermediaries.

This liquidity zone played a key role in May-July 2021. It was the maintenance of this range that allowed buyers to make a growth wave with the final target of $4868. https://www.tradingview.com/x/nRcdlRv0/ Sellers were unable to update the local low during the trading week on 16 May. This is a good sign to start the reversal with the first target of $2600. If you think that ETH is not the same as before and the prospect of its growth and impact on the cryptocurrency market is less significant - analyze how other cryptocurrencies have fallen. Few have been able to maintain local lows since May 2021. The fact that ETH has been able to do so shows its importance to investors. However, it should not be forgotten that the price of ETH broke the trend line, which buyers have held since March 2021. Therefore, the mark of $ 2600 may contain hidden aggression of sellers, which is immediately activated in the test mark. In this case, if buyers are able to keep the mark of $2100, we will expect to continue to form a local wave of growth with the final target of $3700. The nature of the price increase will make it clear whether buyers have enough strength to update the historical high.

39676,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=236954,1653308448,BTC Technical Analysis: Global Consolidation Is Not Over,"The trading week on 16 May passed without much volatile wars between market participants. Comparing how big the weekly candle was relative to the 16 May candle, it seemed that the price had fallen into a slow space. Trading volumes were not as high as last week. However, high enough to indicate the interest of market participants in the range of $29,000. This range is the lower limit of global consolidation, in which the BTC price moves from May 2021. Sellers were able to break this range during the panic week of sales on 9 May. https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ptn8hyMF/ However, buyers did not allow the BTC price to fall below this mark for two weeks. If we look at the history of Bitcoin trading, we see that in November 2021, buyers had a similar situation. The BTC price broke the historical high, but could not be fixed above it. As a result, the bitcoin market has seen a strong counter-trend in the form of a wave of decline. Given the retention of $29,000 by buyers, we believe that the consolidation of Bitcoin in the range of $29,000-$26,000 is incomplete. Therefore, by the end of May, we expect a local reversal of the BTC price with the first target of $38,000. In case of total weakness of buyers - from this mark, the new fall wave and breakdown of the lower range of consolidation can begin. The final target of a local growth wave is the range of $51,000.

42395390,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASwMnt,1653308202,"ICO-Funded Project Sparkster Converts $22M in Ether to USDC After 3 Years, No Product","The conversion in recent days of nearly $22 million of ether into the stablecoin USD coin (USDC) by the seemingly dormant blockchain project Sparkster has got some observers crying foul and calling on the funds to be blacklisted.  Bizarre narratives and ideas claiming world-changing potential peaked at the height of the initial coin offering (ICO) boom in early 2018. While some projects went on to build legitimate products and ecosystems, others have yet to deliver.  Sparkster looks to be in the latter camp. The project raised over $30 million in July 2018 in an ICO for what it described as a ""no-code"" software creation platform. The final tweet from the project’s Twitter account was in 2021 – a link to a demonstration of a supposedly upcoming product. Nothing has been communicated from that account since.  The wallets holding the proceeds from the ICO suddenly became active this weekend, however, and by Monday they were sitting on over $22 million of the stablecoin USDC. The move is seen as unusual and is raising suspicions among some community members – especially in the absence of a public explanation from the Sparkster team.  What happened in 2018?  Project documents show that 30% of the tokens offered by Sparkster were supposed to be distributed between the founding team and initial investors. The funds were to be used to build out a team and to cover legal fees and marketing.  But little happened in the months afterward. No product arrived, and the project’s SPRK tokens were apparently never distributed to investors, prompting the community to threaten the team with legal action in 2019. Sparkster denied all claims of wrongdoing at the time.  The project’s Telegram community channel does not allow members to send messages or interact. A related Telegram channel posted web links to product demonstrations in October 2021 and February 2022. CoinDesk reviewed the sites and found they were walk-throughs for users instead of a functioning tool.  Sparkster’s GitHub repository shows the last activity was three years ago in March 2019. Industry developers, however, say the code has been copied from another application.  Funds on the move  Blockchain data apparently now shows that more than $22 million worth of ether (ETH) from several Sparkster wallets last active over three years ago was converted into USDC over the weekend.  The pseudonymous blockchain analyst zachxbt first reported the findings. One of the wallets, tagged “Sparkster: Wallet 5” on blockchain explorer Etherscan, saw some 2,599 ETH converted to USDC. The wallet was last active 1,371 days ago, or in August 2018.  Another wallet, tagged “Sparkster: Wallet 4,” received 3,002 ETH some 1,371 days ago. Three days ago, however, it converted the full amount over three transactions to more than 6 million USDC.  Data from other wallets shows similar ether amounts were converted to USDC over the weekend. All were last active over three years ago.  Sparkster had not responded to requests for comment via a Twitter direct message by publication time.  Meanwhile, community members tried to bring the USDC holdings to issuer Circle’s attention on Monday, asking the team to blacklist the funds.",NEGATIVE,ETH | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | USDC | TOKEN SALE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/23/ico-funded-project-sparkster-converts-22m-in-ether-to-usdc-after-3-years-no-product,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92dbbf871b2d22f6a9eaf5b56203858ba12476fe-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The long-term downtrend of the last few months has led the EMAs to achieve an inverse alignment with the 50 EMA, which provided the dynamic resistance. But, the recent rally is breaking the opposition and more evidence for the reversal idea. The RSI rises above the oversold line to reach the overbought area after a long consolidating movement. Additionally, the increase in the underlying bullishness is greater than even the 14-day SMA line, increasing the probability of a breakout bullish.

The Onyx Digital Assets network uses tokens for short-term trading in fixed income markets, enabling investors to lend out assets for as little as a few hours without them actually leaving their balance sheets.  Three quarters of deals on the repurchase - or ""repo"" - market are backed by government bonds, meaning it is one of the most important sources of collateral for banks to fund their balance sheets.  Goldman Sachs (GS) has also previously tapped JPMorgan's network for repo trading.  Some $300 billion of intraday repo deals have been conducted on the Onyx network since its launch in 2020.  JPMorgan and BNP Paribas were not available for comment at press time.  ""We see this as part of our efforts to utilise the technology for the whole trading and operations lifecycle as the market evolves,” Joe Bonnaud, global markets chief operating officer for BNP Paribas said, in the report published on Monday.

Play-to-Earn (P2E) is trending in GameFi, besides being a significant catalyst for crypto adoption. According to Triple-A, the total revenue from blockchain gaming has risen from $321 million in 2020 to $1.5 billion in 2021. Blockchain-based games have attracted 1.22 million unique active wallets (UAW) in Q1 2022. Popular titles like Axie Infinity and Decentraland accounted for 22,000 of those. The promise of decentralized ownership, inclusive decision-making procedures, and attractive financial incentives are the primary factors drawing gamers to P2E. GameFi&apos;s success has been a massive push for crypto and blockchain&apos;s acceptance and legitimacy, propelling adoption. GameFi — Gaming That Pays for Real GameFi combines gaming and finance, as the name suggests. It is the financialization of video games using blockchain-based methods to let users monetize their gaming experiences. Play-to-Earn (P2E) is a primary feature of this model. Traditional games have centralized business models where producers retain the maximum profit share, whereas in-game assets aren&apos;t interoperable. Gamers thus have little or no way to monetize grinding or in-game achievements. Moreover, gaming studios have the final say over the game&apos;s development trajectory, the supply of in-game assets, and their use cases.

BTC/USD declined another -3.3% percent last week, and it is down about -35% since this losing streak began eight weeks ago. This is the longest weekly losing streak Bitcoin has ever had since it was created in 2009. The previous record was five consecutive weeks, which last happened between 1 December 2014 and 5 January 2015. However, Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency stuck in a rut. In fact, four out of the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap, excluding stablecoins, are having record-setting weekly losing streaks, with BNB being the exception. Ethereum: Fell for the 7th consecutive week, setting a new record. ETH has fallen around -42% since this down streak began. BNB: Rose last week, finally ending its run of 6 consecutive weekly losses. BNB fell about -30.5% during this losing streak. XRP: Fell for the 8th consecutive week, setting a new record. XRP has fallen about -50.8% since this streak began. Cardano: Fell for the 7th consecutive week, setting a new record. ADA has fallen about -54.33% since this streak began. On a positive note, all of these cryptocurrencies finished slightly up yesterday on the daily timeframe, ending the week strong. Holders will be hoping this strength continues into this week and that these down-streaks finally come to an end. Stock Market Fell for the 7th Straight Week Cryptocurrencies are not the only asset class having a bad run. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq, two leading stock indexes, have fallen seven weeks in a row, highlighting a correlation between the crypto market and the stock market. This suggests that there is a bearish sentiment in financial markets generally at the moment. The S&P 500’s fall for the seventh week is the longest losing streak since the dot-com bubble burst over twenty years ago. Moreover, it’s only the fourth time it has had seven or more consecutive weekly losses since 1931. The S&P 500 dropped 3% this week, its 7th consecutive weekly decline. This is longest weekly down streak since 2001 which fell 8 straight weeks (and is tied w/ 1970 for the record). Here's a look at what happened following the longest down streaks in history… $SPX pic.twitter.com/0I9yuvrEBf — Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) May 20, 2022 According to Charlie Bilello , CEO of Compound Capital Advisors, the S&P 500 is having its fourth-worst start to the year ever, as it’s down -18.2% in its first 97 days of trading. Bilello says the only other years that started worse were 1970 (Vietnam War and US Recession) when it declined by -20.1%, 1940 (World War II) when it declined by -21.4%, and 1932 (Great Depression) when it fell by -32.5%. Why are These Financial Markets Falling? Crypto and the US stock market enjoyed a bullish run throughout most of 2020 and 2021. In fact, the fall we’re seeing now is the first major pullback since the covid pandemic crash back in Feb/Mar 2020. Therefore, you can argue that both crypto and stocks are due a correction, and what we’ve seen recently is just part of a typical bull and bear cycle. However, some underlying fundamental issues might also be shaking investor confidence. For example, the economy in the US and many other countries look relatively fragile at the moment, with a risk of recessions and high inflation. Inflation and higher living costs mean many people will have less spare cash to invest or may have to sell some of their existing holdings to cover additional costs. You also have the ongoing Ukraine war with the risk of escalations and the covid-19 pandemic still lingering in the background, causing disruption to many businesses and workers. In the crypto market specifically, we’ve just seen the collapse of Luna and UST, where both assets lost virtually all of their value. Some industry experts are saying this event is as damaging for crypto as the Mt. Gox scandal.

Insider Trading Rampant in Crypto, According to WSJ The report highlighted that one unknown crypto wallet had acquired a stake worth $360,000 of Gnosis coins, days before Binance revealed that it would list Gnosis on its platform. Shortly after the announcement, the wallet took advantage of the token&apos;s rising price and liquidated everything in 24 hours. Per the report, the anon wallet netted a profit of about $140,000 and a return of roughly 40%. The same wallet also exhibited similar patterns with at least three other tokens. The report further said that 46 wallets had purchased a combined $17.3 million worth of cryptocurrencies just before they were listed on Coinbase, Binance, and FTX. Although visible profits from the sale of the tokens were more than the claims, the actual profits are likely higher. For instance, many wallets moved a part of their stakes to exchanges instead of selling directly. Coinbase, Binance, FTX Denies Claim In response to the report, Coinbase, Binance, and FTX each said they had compliance policies prohibiting employees from trading on insider information.

The fund is to invest in 100 startups in the African continent over the next four years, CV VC said in a press release. According to the announcement, CV VC has invested in 12 startups where ""blockchain use cases go far beyond cryptocurrencies to drive Africa's future to date."" The investor aims to raise between $10 and $50 million through the fund.  Among the 12 startups CV VC has already invested in are Leading House Africa, a startup from Nigeria that will allow land registration on the blockchain, and Mazzuma, a mobile payments platform from Ghana. According to Olaf Hannemann, co-founder and chief investment officer of CV VC, most startups are expected to originate from South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana and Egypt but it is open to funding projects from the entire continent.  “We just want the best ideas from everywhere,” Hannemann said.  On Monday, CV VC published the African Blockchain Report, which highlighted the growth of the blockchain sector in Africa. According to the report, on a year-on-year basis, funding for African blockchain startups outpaced the growth in general African venture funding by 11 times.  Africa is a fast-growing crypto market, attracting large investments from the crypto sector, according to the report. Earlier this month, Pan-African centralized crypto exchange Mara raised $23 million, led by Coinbase Ventures and Alameda Research.

Over the last 24 hours, the altcoin brought home 4.8% gain. Although, there has been a considerable daily gain, AVAX is trading underneath its long-standing price floor. It is difficult for investors to look at just the daily gain as a good enough reason to buy the coin at the moment. Technical for the coin hasn&apos;t suggested strong bullishness which might suggest that AVAX could be a good buy at the time of writing. Avalanche (AVAX) has lost 8% of its market value in the last week. This forced many investors to liquidate the asset and leave. Since, AVAX broke below its long term support area, this could act as an important red flag for the investors. The next solid area of support for AVAX was at $20. The coin traded around the current price level previously in the month of August, a year ago. Avalanche Price Analysis: One Day Chart Avalanche (AVAX) was exchanging hands at $31 at the time of writing. The altcoin has been laterally trading at that price mark for nearly a week now. It revisited this price mark last year, however, back then the coin was on an uptrend. Immediate resistance for the coin stood at $40 as established previously. A fall below the current price level could send AVAX near the $20 support mark. Failing to settle near the $20 mark could bring AVAX anywhere between the $12 and $9 support level.

The consistent downslide of major market movers have pushed many altcoins near their immediate support and below their nearest resistance levels. Recent market conditions have been quite harsh for investors. The returns have been questionable. Polkadot (DOT) has witnessed a sharp fall in buying strength owing to the same bearish condition of the market. The coin has been in the limelight in the recent times due to the latest development. These developments are related to interoperability and features of multi-chain which was announced in the middle of this month. These activities have helped buyers to enter the market. Selling pressure however, continue to outpower buying pressure in the market. Polkadot now has an ecosystem which is consistently striving to bring new projects through para-chain auctions. It is still uncertain if over the upcoming trading sessions that coin can maintain its price action and touch its immediate resistance mark. Polkadot Price Analysis: One Day Chart The altcoin was priced at $10 at the time of writing and after several rejections from the $11 level. Nearest support level for the altcoin stood at $8 and a fall beneath that could land DOT near $6.26. Over the last 48 hours, DOT broke below its 10 month long support line.
