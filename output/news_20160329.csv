42426720,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwJ1h,1459284213,CFTC Commissioner: Agency Should Revisit Rules for Distributed Ledgers,"Commissioner J Christopher Giancarlo of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said today that he believes the government agency should reexamine existing rules as necessary to foster innovation with blockchain technologies.  Giancarlo’s remarks on the possibility of revisiting CFTC regulations in light of new blockchain applications came as part of a keynote address at the DTCC Blockchain Symposium today, in which he discussed his view on the implications of blockchain and distributed ledgers for regulators.  Evoking comparisons to the Internet, Giancarlo went so far as to suggest that regulators such as the CFTC, the primary US regulator for options and futures markets, could drive jobs related to emerging technologies like blockchain to friendlier jurisdictions should they fail to adopt a ‘do no harm’ strategy as they did for the early Web.  Giancarlo said:  ""US lawmakers concerned about the loss of jobs, especially in the New York area, should look to provide similar space for DLT innovation and the well-paying jobs that will surely follow. American advancement in the Internet was enhanced by a do no harm approach.""  Giancarlo cited CFTC regulation 1.31, which deals with its rules for the keeping and inspection of books and records, as one rule that may need to be revisited. In particular, rule 1.31 mandates the storage of records in ""either micrographic or electronic storage media"".  ""I believe the CFTC should revisit this rule … promote the efficiency and accuracy of recordkeeping … and examine as necessary rules that may inhibit distributed ledger technology innovation,"" he said.  Elsewhere in the conversation, Giancarlo spoke broadly about the potential of distributed ledger technology to revolutionize a variety of business processes, noting that his statements represent his own views and not those of the CFTC.  He used this larger narrative to issue a call to action to international regulators, arguing that they should coordinate to reduce burdens for industry startups and firms.  ""I believe regulators and policy owners have a choice, we can burden [innovators] with multiple regulatory schemes or we can come together to encourage distributed ledger investment and innovation,"" he stated. ""I favor that later approach.""  He went on to cite the work being conducted by regulators such as the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), which he lauded as having progressive stances on the technology.  Giancarlo argued that regulatory bodies should collaborate to better understand how they might take a combined approach to industry, concluding:  ""Issues around distributed ledger technology must be dealt with at the multilateral level.""

42426724,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwJ7h,1459279743,Blockstream Among 10 New Firms to Join Hyperledger Blockchain Project,"Bitcoin development startup Blockstream is among 10 new companies that have joined the open-source Hyperledger blockchain project led by the Linux Foundation.  Announced today  , the group of new entrants features a number of startups focused on bitcoin and blockchain services, including Bloq, eVue Digital Labs, Gem, itBit and Ribbit.me.  Consultancy Milligan Partners; payment software developer Montran Labs; intellectual property holdings company Tequa Creek Holdings; and global news service Thomson Reuters have also joined the initiative, which officially launched in December.  Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin said in a statement:  ""The opportunity is great. This leadership team and the community investments among members across industries put the project in the best position possible to accomplish its mission.""  The project also formally unveiled its governing board, which is chaired by blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters. The Hyperledger technical steering committee has already been established and has since held several meetings.  Other governing board members include itBit CEO Charles Cascarilla, IBM vice president of blockchain technologies Jerry Cuomo and JPMorgan head of new product development and emerging technologies Santiago Suarez.  With the announcement, 40 established companies and startups are now working on the Hyperledger project, following an announcement in February that added a number of financial firms as well as blockchain-focused startups.  To date, the project has seen a number of developments, including presentations by JPMorgan and Intel, the latter of which developed an internal blockchain application centered on a fantasy sports marketplace.  More recently, the technical steering committee came close to officially approving a plan to merge code contributed by Blockstream, Digital Asset and IBM.

42426723,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwJ3h,1459277829,"Bitcoin Undervalued By Over $200, Investment Bank Report Finds","Investment bank and asset management firm Needham & Company has released a report that concludes that bitcoin is currently undervalued by 58% based on today's price.  The report  values bitcoin at $655, compared to about $412 today and advises that investors buy shares in the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), a vehicle for speculators to invest in bitcoin without actually buying and holding the asset.  Spencer Bogart, author of the report and Needham's newly appointed equity research associate in charge of bitcoin and blockchain, said that the report is a vote of confidence in an emerging technology many have questioned as a stable store of value.  Bogart told CoinDesk:  ""We believe bitcoin has value as both a digital gold and as a payments channel.""  Currently, there is $74bn worth of gold held in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) around the world, according to the numbers used in the report. Of bitcoin’s market cap of $6.3bn, Bogart estimates roughly 75%, or $4.8bn consists of money being treated as an investment.  That’s 6% of the value of gold ETFs, the report said, a number which the investment bank predicts could increase 25% by 2020.  Bogart used the percentage of bitcoins currently being held as an investment and compared it to investment in gold ETFs to calculate the estimated value of $655.  Emerging consensus  In June 2015, investment firm Wedbush published it own report, predicting bitcoin's price would increase to $600 over the 12-month period following its release.  Compared to Needham's report which valued GBTC at $62, Wedbush put the number at a comparable $60 per share.  According to Bogart, one factor that has lead to such a large difference between the current listed price of bitcoin and the price of bitcoin Needham projects is the rise in popularity of non-bitcoin blockchains using variations of the technology on which bitcoin is built.  While companies like Overstock's tØ are building top-level networks that ride on top of the bitcoin blockchain, other startups are building on new blockchains. Of late, Ethereum, a blockchain with the promise to decentralize more than just the exchange of value is being widely experimented with by major institutions, though they are using a permissioned version of its distributed ledger.  Most recently, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), announced it would build a blockchain proof of concept in partnership with Digital Asset holdings. But as experimentation continues, Bogart continues to believe bitcoin will play a central role.  ""We think there’s a strong possibility that bitcoin will be the nucleus of security for all these blockchains,"" he said.  GBTC's potential  The second section of the report focuses not on bitcoin but on the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCQX: GBTC), a product of Grayscale Investments designed to address investor concerns over investing in bitcoin.  Founded by investor Barry Silbert and launched in mid-2015, the GBTC requires a minimum investment of $25,000.  Investment shares in the trust are worth approximately one-tenth of a bitcoin in an effort to directly tie them to the cryptocurrency's value. As of 31st December, there were 1,476,500 shares issued and outstanding, according to the company’s annual report. Grayscale currently manages $62.6m via the GBTC.  A representative of Grayscale told CoinDesk the company does not respond to third-party reports.

42426733,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwJFh,1459271052,DTCC CEO Pledges Future Blockchain Trials at NY Event,"DTCC president and CEO Mike Bodson indicated today that the US clearing and settlement giant plans to embark on additional distributed ledger technology tests.  The comments came as part of Bodson’s opening remarks at the 2016 Blockchain Symposium, a one-day event held by the DTCC in New York City today. The event features participants from financial institutions such as Barclays, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and the SWIFT Institute.  Word that DTCC is planning additional work with blockchain tech followed the company's announcement of a partnership with industry startup Digital Asset Holdings on a distributed ledger test focused on repo markets applications.  When referencing the Digital Asset trial, Bodson hinted that further announcements are forthcoming, potentially as the result of work with additional industry partners.  Bodson said:  ""We’ll be unveiling more information on these efforts over the next couple months.""  The keynote was preceded by a video presentation documenting industry leaders discussing the hype around blockchain technology – but Bodson was not always optimistic in his remarks about its potential impact.  Bodson sought to stress that, despite the fact that parts of the financial system are ""unnecessarily complex"", the post-trade process in place today is ""efficient and relatively low cost"" while providing ""stability, reliability and certainty"".  ""Blockchain isn’t a hammer and every problem isn’t a nail. There will be opportunities to improve the post-trade process, but it may be more efficient to expand existing tech such as the cloud,"" he said.  Bodson voiced his belief that any innovations the tech can bring will need additional ""investment, time and money"" to bring use cases to fruition, but that more coordination between major players is needed.  ""Virtually every firm is exploring how to use a consensus technology individually. This level of activity may spark innovation … but it is not without it’s pitfalls. So many firms are working on this, the industry runs the risk of creating a maze of distributed ledger silos,"" he said.  Need for coordination  Bodson went on to hint at his vision for the DTCC and its role in what he described as a future in which blockchain changes business, positioning it as a solution to an overcrowded environment.  “Let me stress collaborative,” he said. “Traditional trusted authorities should play a leading role in supporting distributed ledger implementations.”  Bodson posited that such involvement would help enhance efficiencies and drive cost savings, while helping the industry deal with scale and performance challenges – which he argued remain issues with the new technology.  As evidence of the ongoing questions surrounding the scalability of distributed ledgers, Bodson cited discussions surrounding bitcoin, which has been locked in a debate on whether certain network features should be altered to allow for more transactions at a time.  He noted that a recent surge in transactions on the bitcoin network increased verification times to as high as 43 minutes, which he suggested was a sign that blockchains more broadly would perhaps struggle to accommodate the volume of existing technologies used by firms like DTCC.  ""We believe that distributed ledgers like blockchain can revolution, but that they’re not a foregone conclusion,"" Bodson cautioned.

42426725,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwJBh,1459210770,DTCC to Use Digital Asset Tech for Blockchain Post-Trade Trial,"The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a company that oversees the clearing and settlement of $1.6 quadrillion in US securities annually, has announced it will test a distributed ledger solution for managing repurchase (repo) agreements.  The test, a partnership with industry startup Digital Asset Holdings, finds the DTCC embarking on its first trial of blockchain technology, a move that follows its January participation in the firm’s $60m funding round and coincides with a New York-based event focused on distributed ledgers and their applications.  In interview, DTCC managing director of IT architecture Rob Palatnick explained that the effort is designed to both ""validate the technology"" and ensure it can integrate with existing company processes. Palatnick estimated the trial, which the company said will start immediately, would take an unknown number of months to complete.  Palatnick told CoinDesk:  ""The first phase of this is we're going to work with Digital Asset on that internal proof-of-concept making sure the technology can appear on multiple nodes, interact or integrate with our internal processing systems and work alongside it.""  The DTCC, Palatnick said, would not be using distributed ledgers to move digital assets or digital currencies representing repo trades.  Rather it will focus on helping those involved in such processes share information on certain types of repurchase agreements traded via the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), one of its three main subsidiary operations.  ""This is not there’s going to be a Digital Asset chain or ledger and you won’t have to pay a toll to get on the ledger. This will be a DTCC repo ledger, it will be a permissioned ledger,"" Palatnick explained.  Palatnick said DTCC will, in parallel, seek to engage with a variety of participants in the repo market who would be willing to work on ""next steps"" that could take the trial forward. In turn, Digital Asset, he said, will conduct its work as a technology provider.  The trial is notable as it finds the DTCC seeking to aggressively move to experiment with a new technology industry observers have described as a threat to some of its core services. For example, startup Domus Tower has announced plans to attack parts of its market.  The DTCC provides a wide range of clearing and settlement services, charging fees that total upwards of $1.4bn a year for work, according to the firm’s annual reports.  'Ideal' test  As with other financial firms, the DTCC’s trial will focus primarily on using distributed ledger tech to bring multiple parties into a digital environment where they can share information on transactions, without the need to transact in digital assets or digital currencies.  For instance, firms like Symbiont have boasted technology that can recreate these agreements using smart contracts on the blockchain. However, Palatnick said that’s not what the DTCC has in mind for its trial, at least at this stage.  ""This is information sharing,"" Palatnick said. ""The trade occurs, the trade is matched. They agree to the trade on existing systems, it’s put on the ledger, it’s ready to be immutable.""  Palatnick said the repo market use case was a great first candidate for the technology given that trades involve “many parties and complexities” that need to coordinate and be coordinated for the timely delivery of funds.  The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) estimates $2.3tn in repo agreements are traded daily in the US financial system, with the financial agreements often providing day-to-day business financing it deems vital to the market.  The DTCC's trial will focus specifically on US Treasury, agency, and agency mortgage-backed repo transactions.  According to SIFMA estimates, US Treasury Securities are present in 34.7% of repo agreements, while agency mortgage-backed securities and agency securities account for 44.8% and 5.9% of repo agreements, respectively.  Systemic improvements  The DTCC indicated that the test will more specifically seek to bring the company into the “start leg” process of same-day trades.  Today, this occurs outside of the DTCC, Palatnick said, due to the fact that any issues with the payment process could lead to overdraft fees for those involved.  ""Over FedWire, securities and cash are moving, so it better be right,” Palatnick explained.  The distributed ledger environment will be immutable also, Palatnick said, but once confirmed allow the buy- and sell-side firms that act on this information to more immediately provide capital with more efficiency and security while keeping costs low.  ""With many different parties all requiring access to the same information, it’s either everyone shares information or they need to coordinate using different technologies,"" he said.  Participants in the repo market include central banks, corporate and retail banks, insurance companies, industrial companies and pension and hedge funds, among others.  Next steps  Apart from its work with Digital Asset, Palatnick said that DTCC is in talks with other firms specialized in different asset classes.  For example, he said the DTCC has been seeking to improve the start of its repo process for some time, but that Digital Asset proved the right partner due to its focus on this use case.  As such, he said the move should not be taken as a sign DTCC believes Digital Asset’s technology is preferred over alternatives, or that it will be the sole blockchain solution for the market.  ""I think we’ve made the point that we expect many different ledgers and partnerships that help solve the challenges of the financial industry,"" Palatnick said.  As for the expected outcome of the trial, Palatnick said there has been a specific criteria for success set down, though he did not rule out the possibility the trial could potentially fail to deliver expected results.  Palatnick concluded:  ""If it’s going to fail, it’ll fail fast.""
