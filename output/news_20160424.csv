42394467,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw6qFx,1461517154,Why US FinTech is a Joke,"John Biggs is CEO of stealth bitcoin startup Freemit and a former editor at TechCrunch. His work has appeared in publications such as The New York Times, Gizmodo and Men's Health.  In this opinion piece, Biggs takes aim at out-of-touch banks and timid FinTech investors for what he argues is the way they are disrupting innovation to the detriment of consumers.  In speaking with FinTech investors and the companies they’ve supported, I’ve found one thing to be true: FinTech in the US is an incremental game of kick-the-can populated by entrepreneurs who are incessantly stymied by frightened bankers and investors.  If there is any one place ripe for disruption, it is the milquetoast world of financial technology.  In building Freemit, we met countless entrepreneurs who walked a similar path. They wanted to change the way something worked in an implicit way, whether it was through a new way to manage payments, a new way to send money or a new way to create contracts.  These entrepreneurs had pedigrees far beyond what is expected of the average team building the latest Silicon Valley darling, and they were aware of the limitations of FinTech and the perils that awaited them.  When we began our process, we were told again and again that the road would be hard and we would be stopped at every turn.  This is absolutely true and endlessly frustrating. The US FinTech space is timid, timorous and inbred, and the room for disruption is defined by how best to wedge yourself into existing scams.  Thankless task  Innovation in US FinTech is not rewarded. It is considered suspect.  Anything that upsets one person in a big bank is immediately scrapped. Ideas are neutered and spayed with abandon and all that’s left are ""software solutions"" that entrepreneurs hope to sell for a few million a year to an IT director who didn’t say ""No"" that day.  The result? The winners are me-too widgets that make one trader’s life better in one building in one office on Wall Street. Entrepreneurs essentially give up and fall back to status-quo ideas that are software-only and perhaps make trading easier.  In short, they abandon real innovation in order to kowtow to the banks, regulators, and whoever else is having a bad day because their golf game was interrupted by a server fault.  Sure, there are folks out there trying mightily to change the way things work, but they are not being rewarded. Sit down and talk with some old-guard financial types and you will see that improvements to their creaking ships are unwanted and seen as too difficult or frightening to implement.  Amazing ideas – ideas that will pull the banking industry out of the coming doldrums – are suspect.  Abandon ship  Make no mistake – the banking industry is in trouble, and millennials want no part of the old regime.  ""They have their own tools and their own rules, and the traditional legacy scheme that we've set up for doing things in certain institutional sectors doesn’t really matter to them,"" said Donna Sabino, senior vice president at Ipsos MediaCT, in a recent Forbes article.  The report goes on to note that Millennials can expect a $41tn wealth transfer ""through mid-century"".  ""Their financial behaviors have the potential to redefine financial services and transform how financial services companies interact with their customers,"" writes Laura Shin.  To some degree, the improvement over the status quo can be as simple as slapping a prettier face on an old system. But even this is fraught with backwards thinking. I mentioned chatbots to a Chase executive who said they already had chat in place. He meant a way to request your balance via text message.  Who is doing it right? The only (former) US person I can think of off-hand is Erik Voorhees, who abandoned the US entirely and holds no customer money.  By playing it completely safe – no regulator can touch his business even though they’d love to – he has proven that there is no benefit to incorporating a FinTech company in the US. He is even transparent about being hacked. Considering the average bank would only admit defeat months after an attack, his is a bold path.  Folly of 'blockchain'  How can US FinTech survive?  Primarily through acceptance of some risk as well as by embracing new technologies on the terms of those technologies. And that doesn’t mean co-opting the tech and paying lip service to its value.  ""They started with denial,"" said technologist Andreas Antonopoulos. ""'Heh, Bitcoin. Go play you little hackers.' Then they noticed it wasn’t going away. So they started getting angry. 'Err, Bitcoin… Criminals! Pedophiles! Terrorists! The world will end if we allow normal people to control their own money.'""  Further, pretending to support innovation is silly.  ""'So that nice open, decentralized, borderless, peer-to-peer, open-innovation, open-access system you built,'"" said Antonopoulos. ""'Well, we can build one that is not open, not decentralized, not borderless, not open-innovation, and not open-access that we control completely… blockchain!' And they’re missing the point.""  No one will deny that the stewardship of great wealth is a frightening responsibility.  But by abandoning innovation for safety, that stewardship is done in half measures. Like the parable of the three servants to which the master has given out money, we find that Europe and Asia are the first two servants and the US is the third.  The two wise servants invest the master's money and make the master a great profit. The foolish servant buries it and returns with nothing more than the perception of security.  That this is the case is a true shame and leaves the US in the dust – to the benefit of every other region in the world.

42378655,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lI0h,1461513023,The Four Types of Bitcoin Users,"Dr Paul Ennis is a research assistant at The Centre for Innovation, Technology & Organization at University College Dublin, specializing in bitcoin and blockchain studies.  In this opinion piece, Dr Ennis discusses the wide range of bitcoin users and how their varying opinions on how the technology should develop is impacting network progress.  There are many assumptions about bitcoin users – that they are oddballs, fantasists, nerds, criminals, idealists and so on.  But what are they actually like?  Some of the assumptions listed above are technically true in some cases, but the reality is never as simple as that. Of course, one of the simplest, but nonetheless effective, means of ascertaining who uses bitcoin is to analyze Google Trends, as we find in Yelowitz and Wilson (2015).  Although an imperfect method, since ""search query need not imply active participation"", Yelowitz and Wilson identify four types of broad bitcoin users: computer programming enthusiasts, speculative investors, libertarians and criminals (2015, pg 1030).  This very much fits the ""expected"" profile of bitcoin users, and it also closely fits the results of a 2013 survey of 1,000 bitcoin users that found ""the average user is a 32-year-old libertarian male"".  (Full disclosure: I am a 32-year-old male, but not a libertarian as such).  From the perspective of these four types, the major reasons for bitcoin's appeal are:  For computer programmers, the rewards for mining  For speculators, the volatility  For the libertarians, the perceived lack of regulation  For criminals, the perceived anonymity.  Libertarians are well-represented in bitcoin's non-academic literature, with themes concerning the potential of the technology to alter the prevalent social and economic orders (eg Kelly, 2015; Casey and Vigna, 2015).  Books aimed at speculators, as one might expect, focus on bitcoin’s potential as an investment (Wilcox, 2014). Computer programmers enthusiasts are well-served by Swan (2015) and Antonopoulos (2015). The former is very blockchain-focused while the latter, true to form, is bitcoin-focused.  Criminal elements  Another prominent community, criminals came to be associated with bitcoin via the story of the Silk Road marketplace.  Silk Road was an online marketplace operating on what is known variously as the Dark Web, the Dark Net or, erroneously, the Deep Web. The latter covers all the parts of the web that search engines do not index, but the ""dark"" aspect refers to sites that feature user anonymity and are, by default, difficult to access. Unsurprisingly, these markets are popular among this subset (Bartlett, 2014).  In terms of scale, for the criminal vector, the classic study by Christin (2013) of Silk Road put the revenue numbers in an eight-month period in 2011–2012 to roughly $1.2m, with $92,000 going to the operators of the marketplace.  Now, the above description tends to relate to what one might term the generic bitcoin community, meaning they are the people who either mine, buy, trade or use bitcoin routinely (or are committed hoarders with an eye toward using it as a store of value).  Even if bitcoin is arguably not a currency, as some claim, it is treated as such by this community.  Different definitions  When it comes to trying to understand what bitcoin is, we often find that arguments center upon its status as a currency as understood in regulatory, financial or legal terms. Currency is one way to grasp bitcoin, albeit one related to questions about how the digital currency might come to fit into mainstream society.  Bitcoin users often seem conflicted on the issue. On the one hand, they want bitcoin to be different than what has come before, but they also, for various reasons, want to see more people using it.  This conflict helps explain why the community nearly split over the scaling debate, but from a different angle. Miners, for instance, were drawn to BIP 100 (introduced by developer Jeff Garzik) for a few technical reasons, but one social one is that it allows the miners to become active voters on the future of the Bitcoin Core reference client.  Some speculators support Bitcoin Classic because it means faster transactions that speak to this entrepreneurial spirit that wants bitcoin adoption to grow significantly faster.  Libertarians are caught somewhere in the middle. They don’t want the miners to become too centralized, but also seem tuned into the fact that the Bitcoin Core development community could be seen as a centralized structure, too.  They also might want wider adoption for ideological reasons, but also want to avoid a major screw-up in the form of a disastrous hard fork that could imperil the network's future.  Criminals will carry on as they always have, but are largely outside of the mainstream conversation at present.  Concluding remarks  Bitcoin users are, then, precisely what one would expect on paper: technically literate, politically plugged-in and economically motivated.  However, one must remember that just become someone is a libertarian, this does not translate into automatic sympathy to dark net criminals. Nor is there a clean path for the libertarian when it comes to decentralization: for the traditional technologically-focused decentralist this means disavowing large block-increases just to facilitate faster transactions.  To the more economically-minded, decentralization means no block limit at all, and thus wider adoption of bitcoin for commercial uses.  What the scaling debate has revealed is that there is no homogenous community of Bitcoin ""types"" per se, but rather various factions united under the umbrella term of decentralization.
