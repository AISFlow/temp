42400604,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK86I,1509570150,SEC: Celebrity ICO Endorsements Could Be Illegal,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a warning to investors about celebrity-endorsed initial coin offerings (ICOs).  The SEC – which released a wide-ranging statement on the blockchain use case in late July – said today that celebrities who endorse token sales may run afoul of ""anti-touting"" laws if they don't correctly state what compensation, if any, they may have received.  The agency said:  ""Celebrities and others are using social media networks to encourage the public to purchase stocks and other investments. These endorsements may be unlawful if they do not disclose the nature, source, and amount of any compensation paid, directly or indirectly, by the company in exchange for the endorsement.""  In recent months, celebrities such as actors Jamie Foxx and William Shatner, boxing champ Floyd Mayweather, Jr., and hotel heiress Paris Hilton, among others, have publicly endorsed several projects ahead of their respective token sales.  The SEC also warned potential investors to not base their decisions solely on the endorsement of a celebrity.  ""Investors should note that celebrity endorsements may appear unbiased, but instead may be part of a paid promotion. Investment decisions should not be based solely on an endorsement by a promoter or other individual,"" the agency wrote.

42400580,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK6bo,1509568524,New Zealand Regulator: Cryptocurrencies Are Securities,"New Zealand's finance regulator has released new guidance on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies.  In a statement published last week, the New Zealand Financial Markets Authority (FMA) outlined the ways in which token sales would be covered under national law. Notably, the regulator said that, in its view, any cryptocurrency or ICO-derived token would be considered a security.  The FMA said:  ""All tokens or cryptocurrencies are securities under the [Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013] – even those that are not financial products. A security is any arrangement or facility that has, or is intended to have, the effect of a person making an investment or managing a financial risk.""  Citing that law, the agency went on to say that tokens could fall into one of four financial product categories – debt securities, equity securities, managed investment products or derivatives – depending on their characteristics.  That said, the FMA left the door open to additional classification for such offerings, through which the technology can be used to bootstrap a blockchain network through the sale and release of tokens.  ""If appropriate, we can designate any security to be a particular financial product based on its economic substance. For example, a project token giving investors voting rights and a share in the company and its profits could be designated an equity security,"" the agency wrote.  Guidelines for startups  The published materials also include guidance for businesses working with the technology.  For major cryptocurrency services — such as wallets, brokers and exchanges — the FMA argues it does have a category for all of these services, and such companies should be appropriately registered.  Additionally, the agency suggested that it could provide exemptions from current laws to companies in an effort to ""promote innovation and flexibility.""  The FMA said:  ""We can grant exemptions to promote the FMC Act’s objectives. One objective is to promote innovation and flexibility in our financial markets. We can also, if appropriate, grant exemptions to ensure FMC Act requirements are fit for purpose for ICOs.""  When reached for comment, a representative for the FMC said that the agency was seeking to strike the right balance between market oversight and allowing for new kinds of products and services to take shape.  ""Our aim is to encourage responsible innovation, balancing innovation against consumer protection and ensuring the regulatory regime remains relevant and agile,"" the representative said.

42400582,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK6dm,1509559215,Split or No Split? Bitcoin Miners See No Certainty in Segwit2x Fork,"It's hard to find a franker bunch in the world of blockchain.  While the attitudes of more corporate miners may have created the impression the sector itself is shrouded in secrecy, the trope doesn't exactly hold weight. And though it's true those who run the computers that secure bitcoin can be evasive, they're often also brash – a trait no doubt heightened by the fact that they effectively create value out of thin air.  But combine this penchant with linguistic and cultural gaps, and you have a recipe for mixed signals. Quite simply, it can be hard to tell where miners stand on issues related to the technology – even those in which they arguably play a leading role.  Not to mention, in an industry that changes fast, miner's opinions can evolve just as quickly.  Jiang Zhuoer, founder of the world's third-largest mining pool, BTC.Top, for example, isn't shy about his opinion on bitcoin's upcoming Segwit2x fork, the third this year following bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold.  But Zhuoer, whose pool serves 12.4 percent of the world's bitcoin miners, appears to already be personally embracing alternatives, even after signing an agreement that might suggest his preference would be otherwise.  He told CoinDesk:  ""To be honest, I do not care about bitcoin now, bitcoin cash is bitcoin. I earn by mining bitcoin, [selling it] and buying bitcoin cash. We mine for the most profit and buy bitcoin cash.""  Such statements can send conflicting signals. After all, many of the network's code proposals effectively call on miners (a significant stake of the network's node operators) to initiate contentious changes to protocol rules. And while this practice has encountered criticism, it nonetheless persists.  Indeed, one of the biggest open questions ahead of bitcoin's upcoming Segwit2x hard fork is how many miners will actually stand by their agreement to run the software, and if they will do so unilaterally, dedicating all their hash power to the cause.  As of now, metrics are only relative.  While most miners who signed the agreement write the phrase ""NYA"" into the blocks they produce, doing so isn't binding. Further, due to the semantics of how mining works, it remains to be seen whether enough of the network will move to change bitcoin's rules so as to eliminate the chance of creating another cryptocurrency.  The pool problem  Personal opinion aside, Zhuoer is in the business of selling what amounts to software subscriptions – the BTC.Top pool coordinating global miners into a unit whereby any rewards collected by any participant are distributed equitably.  So, while he may have certain opinions, Zhuoer must also consider users, a fact he acknowledges.  He notes, for instance, BTC.Top's own mining aside, the company plans to allow customers to ""choose to mine any coin"" or automatically switch between blockchains, turning their computing power to whatever coin is most lucrative, even after Segwit2x.  So, while his mind is made up, he is less clear on whether he believes a blockchain split is likely, or that his opinion is material on the outcome.  ""I do not know. We should ask bitcoin users,"" he said via WeChat. ""They decide the result.""  Haipo Yang, CEO of ViaBTC, the fourth largest pool by mining power, agreed, indicating that his pool will only offer bitcoin mining on the original bitcoin chain to begin.  ""We have not received user request to run 2x. If 2x survives and the users request it, we will support both. Let the users have a choice,"" he told CoinDesk via WeChat.  If Zhuoer and Yang's statements are any indication, then, it might not be best to view the proposed figures for how much hashing power will support Segwit2x as set in stone.  Also on the record for backing out of Segwit2x is bitcoin mining pool F2Pool, with its operator Wang Chun telling CoinDesk in August that he didn't support the New York Agreement any longer. At press time, F2Pool is no longer ""flagging"" for the change in its blocks.  Still, as with Zhuoer's operation, Chun operates a pool and it's unclear whether his miners will be given the choice to run a version of the bitcoin software of their choosing. Chun did not respond to requests for comment.  Although, there is some precedent for slow adoption of new software. In the rollout of bitcoin cash, mining pools slowly opened up to the new software, with ViaBTC launching the option first and BTC.Top and Bitmain's AntPool following suit soon after.  The new statements suggest a similar, staggered approach could be ahead.  Conscientious objectors  But, as noted in our explainer, the difference here is that bitcoin cash wanted to leave the bitcoin blockchain behind, while Segwit2x is seeking to make its code ""bitcoin's code.""  As such, a choppy rollout could have unseen and possibly unsafe implications, creating a period where there are two chains, even though one may win out.  But not everyone agrees that one version is likely.  Jan Capek, CEO of the fifth largest mining pool Slush Pool, said he'll be aligning behind Bitcoin Core developers in their rejection of the Segwit2x software.  In his view, the introduction of the Segwit2x software will definitely ""lead to the creation of two bitcoins"" – one of which runs on a blockchain with bitcoin's current rules, and the other which features the rules proposed by Segwit2x supporters.  Despite the fact that businesses are backing the proposal, he sees Segwit2x as the latest in a trend that's bound to bring diminishing returns.  ""I would expect that every new fork will have a smaller impact than the previous one,"" he said.  It's also notable that smaller miners seemed more inclined to believe a split is more likely. Li Ang, who operates 1 petahash-worth of mining equipment for a smaller mining pool called Canoe Pool, called it ""an event with a high possibility.""  Likewise, litecoin developer 'PZ,' an organizer of a meeting that led to litecoin miners passing a tech upgrade in April, said Segwit2x ""will create a new currency.""  Finally, Jack Liao, the CEO of Lightning ASIC, the company behind the bitcoin gold hard fork, also forecasted that ""four chains"" with four unique cryptocurrencies will likely survive November.  Wild card  Still, the wild card appears to be whether bitcoin cash has effectively shifted perception, as the blockchain boasts an 8 MB block size, considerably higher than the 2 MB block size Segwit2x will introduce.  With this in mind, it isn't just Zuoer who noted he prefers bitcoin cash to Segwit2x. Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com, an educational website that offers a mining pool, said that while he's ""very bullish"" on the fork in the short term, he's ""even more bullish"" on bitcoin cash in the long run.  Inked in May, the New York Agreement predates the creation of bitcoin cash and so doesn't appear to factor that cryptocurrency in. But industry observers believe the creation of the bitcoin cash protocol and the investments that have been made into it have shifted long-term strategies for miners.  Evoking the grand terms that sometimes best befit bitcoin power games, Steven Mosher, head of sales and marketing at mining chip maker Canaan, believes that, in the long-term, miners will support Segwit2x as a way to boost investment in bitcoin cash. Indeed, Mosher, whose company sells chips to miners big and small, said his customers largely have a preference for bitcoin cash, and he noted he sees them participating in the build-up of what he called a ""long-term infrastructure play.""  All in all, he sees the Segwit2x fork as part of some behind-the-scenes power jockeying that will continue to pit miners against developers against businesses, perhaps in the self-interest necessitated all along by the nature of bitcoin's distributed system.  He concluded:  ""In the mining world, they believe value follows hashrate. More chains equals more hardware.""  Correction: An earlier version of this article suggested F2pool was still signaling for Segwit2x in its blocks. This has been revised.

Bitcoin gold  is a fork of the bitcoin network, created with the primary aim of restricting the use of specialized chips for bitcoin mining through a change in the code. The effort is backed by an open-source community of relatively unknown developers, as well as LightningASIC, a seller of mining hardware based in Hong Kong.  The addition of replay protection is intended to prevent users from sending both bitcoin gold and bitcoin when making a transaction meant to occur on just one chain – a necessity owing to the shared code between those two networks. Without the measure, a user might inadvertently send their coins to a different address, losing control of them in the process.

OpenBazaar Version 2.0 Is Here,"The startup behind OpenBazaar has released version 2.0 of its popular bitcoin-powered marketplace.  First launched in 2014, the software update marks a milestone for startup OB1, which bills its product as a decentralized eBay or Shopify for cryptocurrency users. And with an updated design that should make it easier for buyers and sellers to get started, three years later, the company may be closing in on its goal.  According to OB1 CEO Brian Hoffman, it's the user experience that's at the heart of this new design.  Hoffman told CoinDesk:  ""We found very quickly that doing things in a decentralized fashion is not always super intuitive for people. You have to to design around it. You have to make it really really good.""  The company announced a beta release of the update in September. While, at that point, the product was feature-complete, developers needed to find any bugs in all of the ""weird edge cases,"" as Hoffman put it.  ""Version 2.0 is just saying that this is stable enough to do real trades,"" he said.  So what's new? The most noticeable new feature is the smoother design and workflow. With version 2.0, the company has taken on board how people use the app and what they think about the product experience.  For example, if a user went to create a store in the old version, they would never have been asked for a bitcoin wallet address (they didn't actually need one until they closed a sale). This made sense from a development perspective, but it confused users. Now, OpenBazaar has a fully functional wallet built in.  Other features include updated search (in fact, there are three different search engines integrated so far, two by independent teams). Installation is easier than it was, and it's also integrated with The Onion Router (Tor) and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), offering stronger privacy to store owners and shoppers, along with an improved infrastructure.  Looking ahead, the team is now working on mobile and web versions of the product. Also on the roadmap is allowing users to buy and sell with cryptocurrencies aside from bitcoin.  But it's the emphasis on usability, not technology, that Hoffman hopes will define the software going forward.  For sellers, Hoffman argues that ""OpenBazaar is a simple way to get a store up and running that accepts bitcoin."" For consumers, he said they can find things on OpenBazaar that aren't available anywhere else.  For users that tried it before but got frustrated, Hoffman is now urging them to come back, saying, ""It was a super rough experience. It was our first cut.""

As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has witnessed a 9 percent gain in value over the last 24 hours.  Possibly driving the rally, Bitcoin ABC – the most widely used version of the bitcoin cash software – released upgrade 0.16.0 today, with changes to come into effect via a hard fork on Nov. 13. Meant to ease economic concernshttps://www.bitcoinabc.org/november with its mining network, the code was announced yesterday to a mixed reaction from investors and enthusiasts.  But though the news is positive, a clear link cannot be established between the software upgrade and today's climb in price. Similarly, the cryptocurrency lost its mojo earlier this week, as investors appeared to assess if the upcoming technical upgrade would lead to a split of the blockchain (and separate competing currencies).  Those fears still persist, although the consensus seems to be building among investors that a chain split is unlikely and that participants only need to upgrade the software.  Meanwhile, as per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency's price might also be being pumped by Korean trading desks.

42400590,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK6ih,1509531330,ZoKrates Seeks to Bring Best of Zcash to Ethereum with Devcon Debut,"It's perhaps no surprise Jacob Eberhardt is being given the stage at ethereum's annual developer conference.  With scalability and privacy top of mind for the blockchain network, now valued in the billions, the Ph.D. researcher at the Technical University of Berlin is set to debut a new programming language at the Cancun, Mexico, event, one designed to help ethereum improve on these key weaknesses.  Called ZoKrates, the goal of the project is to provide developers with a toolkit that could help them realize the potential of a much-anticipated blockchain privacy tool called zk-snarks.  Pioneered by the cryptocurrency zcash, ethereum's recent software update, enacted in October, paved the way for the easier use of the code, and because it effectively unlocks the use of this feature, the implications of ZoKrates are potentially vast.  For one, it's designed to be simple for any ethereum developer to deploy, which could lead privacy features to begin surfacing in decentralized applications and tokens. And second, because zk-snarks compress information, ZoKrates has the potential to help scale the ethereum platform by moving computations off the main blockchain, easing data storage.  In short, ZoKrates allows information to be obscured off the main ethereum blockchain and then uploaded into a smart contract the network can still verify, all without exposing contract information.  Eberhardt told CoinDesk:  ""Zk-snarks were discussed a lot, but the gap between the theoretical concept and its practical application seemed huge. This gap, I try to bridge.""  Cost benefits  Also of note is how exactly Eberhardt believes he's accomplished the feat.  To start with, ZoKrates is a type of ethereum smart contract. A custom version of the self-executing code that runs on top of the network, the tool serves as a way to transfer a zk-snark operation onto the blockchain and to verify that that information is valid.  As Eberhardt describes it, a ZoKrates contract verifies that a computation, or set of transactions, occurred correctly – or in his words, it ""transforms a program into a set of conditions.""  This moves ethereum one step closer to offering private transactions on its blockchain. Yet, like bringing privacy to ethereum in the first place, the endeavor is far from simple.  For one, verifying a zk-snark is still expensive. When encrypted information is read and accepted onto the ethereum blockchain, it requires a lot of computational effort, which in ethereum is measured in units of ""gas."" Crucially, though, the cost of verifying a ZoKrates contract, while high, remains uniform at all times, regardless of the complexity of the computation.  At present, a ZoKrates verification fee is about 1.6 million gas. Put simply for possible users, anything above this figure would be cheaper to run on ZoKrates.  As for what occurs on the blockchain itself, computations would still need to fit in ethereum's block size constraints. However, rather than filling blocks with transaction data, the distributed ledger would feature proof that the verification of any transactions had taken place.  Challenges ahead  While the possibilities are exciting, the project isn't without its hurdles, though.  Eberhardt identified two major challenges: for one, ZoKrates is still very much under development, meaning that while the code has been open-sourced, it's not ready to be used in production applications.  On top of that, Eberhardt is currently working solo on the project, with some input and discussion from ethereum's zk-snarks lead Christian Reitwiessner. For that reason, Eberhardt said, the development timeline can't be predicted.  And, of course, as always in the blockchain world, there are concerns about zk-snarks themselves, and alternative concepts are competing for attention.

42400585,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK6cn,1509531329,Bitcoin 'Battle'? Core Developers Apathetic as Segwit2x Fork Approaches,"""The chain will fork, life will go on.""  Pseudonymous Bitcoin Core contributor BTCDrak views bitcoin's upcoming Segwit2x hard fork – which has a chance of splitting bitcoin into two competing networks – with a bit of boredom.  And that blase tone seems to resonate with several of bitcoin's most active developers, even those who were vocally unhappy when the Segwit2x proposal was first unveiled in May. But just a couple weeks away from the fork itself, it appears this outrage has turned steadily into annoyed acceptance.  In short, the contributors to bitcoin's open-source code are optimistic for a simple reason: they don't think Segwit2x will succeed in its attempt to become the main bitcoin blockchain.  Against the backdrop over the past few months, in which two hard forks led bitcoin to split into new assets with different developer teams, bitcoin's long-time developers largely believe neither has come close to surpassing bitcoin by any significant metric.  And they don't expect differently from Segwit2x.  While the group behind the effort has secured the support of a number of startups and mining pools, they argue there's not much of a difference in the support as compared to previous forks. Though the next fork has yet to occur (it's expected in mid-November), they already see Segwit2x as a blip in bitcoin's history.  BTCDrak told CoinDesk:  ""Miners will continue to mine bitcoin.""  No more compromise  And other developers feel similarly.  Blockstream CEO Adam Back and Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo claim they tried to be diplomatic when the proposal was first unveiled in June, arguing they wanted to work with those supporting Segwit2x to come to a scaling agreement.  Back explained that he sincerely wanted to ""build on the proposal,"" although he advocated for a longer hard fork timeline and a specific hard fork mechanism.  Yet, both are less willing to compromise as the hard fork date inches closer.  Central to this sentiment is that, ultimately, developers think Segwit2x will fail because the way it's implemented goes against how bitcoin is intended to work – that, and because it tries to push through a change that doesn't have broad support.  As a result, developers contend that the group is using a centralized strategy to drive decision-making on a decentralized network.  ""I was hopeful that the intent of this whole thing was to activate SegWit and then work together, as a community, on building consensus for further upgrades in the future,"" Lombrozo said. ""Instead, it turned into a coup.""  Back voiced similar concerns.  ""It sets a very bad precedent that a small group of CEOs can get in a hotel room and make a pact that they then try to impose on bitcoin. That is no longer bitcoin.""  And with that, both developers believe the proposal will die by its own hand.  Tale of two bitcoins  But before it dies – or launches – crypto investors are trading on the possibilities.  Future versions of bitcoin (should bitcoin remain whole after the fork) and a new Segwit2x bitcoin (should the hard fork create a new coin) are trading on a handful of exchanges. And it seems developers believe this sheds light on events to come.  According to Back, the price of the Segwit2x coins – trading at about 14 percent of the price of bitcoin currently – is a sign of just how successful the cryptocurrency will be.  Back continues, pointing out that this is just about the same percentage that bitcoin cash coins were trading at before it launched via a hard fork of bitcoin in August.  ""Investors will sell Segwit2x [coins] in droves,"" Back claimed.  And he can say that because he's offered to sell his own bitcoin for the new Segwit2x coin at a series of different swap rates, starting with a 1-to-1 rate.  ""When [investors] didn't buy that, I offered a 3-for-2 swap, and now I am offering a 2 -for-1 swap – a chance to double their [Segwit2x coin] holdings,"" he said. ""None of them bought. So, clearly, they do not have commitment, nor belief in what they are saying.""  Still, many Core developers believe the Segwit2x hard fork will result in another cryptocurrency.  And while many bitcoin users and investors see previous forks as a net positive (since they were effectively airdropped free money) Lombrozo hopes something else will come out of the process.  Summing up his feelings, Lombrozo displayed almost a sense of exhaustion.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The whole thing is stupid, I just hope this serves as a good lesson for everyone on how not to do these things.""

In the patent, awarded on Oct. 31, British Telecommunications PLC (BT) outlined a method designed to prevent malicious attacks on blockchains – outlining a way to limit who can commit transactions to the system through user-specific profiles. The blockchain's underlying code would then be able to automatically reject transactions which do not match the pre-described accounts.  One example use case outlined by the patent includes ""majority control attacks"" (also called ""51 percent attacks""), where a hostile force with more than 50 percent of the total computing power tries to control a blockchain network.  According to the patent:  ""Despite the architecture of blockchain systems, malicious attacks present a threat to the security and reliability of blockchains.""  When an attack is detected, the system will automatically stop conducting transactions, preventing even a majority attack from being effective, according to the patent.  The patent further cites include distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which are designed to completely overwhelm a miner with an excessive number of transaction requests.  BT does not address how it would deal with such attacks, however it does state that ""it would be advantageous to provide a mechanism for detecting and mitigating threats to blockchain environments.""  While the patent discusses the method of verifying transactions through the energy-intensive mining process employed by digital currencies like bitcoin, BT notes that the process is unrelated to the patented system.

42400593,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcK6nc,1509508821,Understanding Segwit2x: Why Bitcoin's Next Fork Might Not Mean Free Money,"Bitcoin is gearing up for what could be the biggest (and least understood) change to its software to date.  Often called simply a ""digital currency,"" bitcoin is best viewed as a protocol (a set of code) that delivers data (in this case bitcoins) in defined quantities (called blocks) that are then stored in a sequence (called a blockchain) on a distributed set of global computers. Bitcoin is decentralized – in that many people help make the network function, and in choosing to run its software, users all agree to abide by the same rules to keep it operational.  It's these qualities that make the proposed change particularly divisive.  Called Segwit2x, the plan calls for a very specific fork (or a change to bitcoin's rules), one that would make certain rules valid that weren't valid before. Specifically, Segwit2x would change the size of the blocks passed regularly around the network and stored in the blockchain from 1 MB to 2 MB.  Some users think this is a good idea, others don't.  But to begin, it's important to note how this fork differs from others. Coming on the heels of the bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold forks, bitcoin users might be accustomed to certain outcomes – ones that might not be guaranteed in the case of Segwit2x.  With bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold, for example, bitcoin users could have paid little to no attention and it wouldn't have impacted their transactions. If you held bitcoin on certain exchanges (or your own wallet), you received new cryptocurrency.  This smooth outcome, however, isn't guaranteed with Segwit2x. Complicating matters is that in many ways, Segwit2x sounds (and is) similar to other bitcoin forks.  Like other recent forks, Segwit2x is:  An alternative software – A modification of the bitcoin software run by network participants and that enforces the protocol rules. In this case, Segwit2x's code is called BTC1.  An attempt to increase the block size – Most forks focus on one specific rule of the network (block size), despite other possible optimizations that could lead to capacity boosts.  A hard fork – Anyone whose software is not upgraded to the new rules will no longer be a part of the network.  It's the differences, however, that stand out this time around.  First and foremost, whereas bitcoin cash developers appeared content to create a new blockchain (with new rules), Segwit2x's goal is to keep all bitcoin's existing users on one blockchain.  In this way, Segwit2x could have different outcomes.  These include:  Bitcoin's rules change. Most (or all) miners upgrade their software. The bitcoin blockchain continues to function but features larger blocks. Segwit2x's rules become the rules of bitcoin.  Two bitcoins are created. Only some miners upgrade their software. This creates two blockchains – a so-called ""legacy"" bitcoin, and a ""Segwit2x"" bitcoin, both with different rules and unique cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin's rules do not change. No significant miners run the new software, and the network continues to run the current rules.  For or against?  However, it's the second outcome that might be of most concern to users, given it appears possible.  The reason is that those who support the change, and those who do not, both appear to have support from different parts of the community. In short, while Segwit2x claims to have a super-majority of miners and exchanges, it can't be said that 100% of network users support just one side.  Segwit2x draws the most support from:  Miners – The network users who run hardware necessary to secure the blockchain and profit from bitcoin's block rewards.  Startups – The businesses that profit by providing a service to bitcoin users, allowing them to spend, store or purchase cryptocurrencies.  They argue:  Bitcoin should be digital money. It should compete with the U.S. dollar or other fiat currencies, and thus, a priority should be put on its use as a means of exchange.  Competitors are gaining because of bitcoin's inaction. They believe protocols other than bitcoin have continued to gain traction because they're useful for payments; those protocols are currently capturing value that otherwise would have been bitcoin's.  Existing upgrades aren't enough. They say the addition of code to the blockchain in August hasn't brought about the capacity increases promised.  Other groups oppose this thinking.  They include:  Developers – The voluntary group that maintains bitcoin's code; this group includes a number of people that have arguably worked on the bitcoin protocol the longest.  Node operators – The bitcoin users who store copies of the blockchain's full transaction history (with bigger blocks, they will see rising storage costs).  They argue:  Bitcoin is a store of value, not a payment network. Though, they seem to think the latter is possible in the future as the technology advances.  Segwit2x is risky. Should bitcoin break or fail to deliver transactions, they believe this could undermine the project as a whole.  Segwit2x gives miners and business too much power. They argue that this effectively centralizes decision-making for a decentralized network, undermining bitcoin's strongest value proposition.  How likely is a split?  For now, it’s perhaps too early to say for sure. But with that in mind, we do have some indications given the mechanics of how Segwit2x has been coded.  This is because:  Segwit2x uses BIP 9 activation. This means that the rule change is governed by the percentage of miners running the new code.  Miners mostly support Segwit2x. 1Hash, Bitfury, Bitmain, Bixin, BTC.com, BTCC, BTC.Top and ViaBTC all signed the original agreement, reached in May.  On paper, the plan boasts roughly 80% of the network's miners as signatories, a group some believe is big enough to switch the majority the network over to the Segwit2x chain, and quickly (for fear of being left on an unprofitable software).  The reasoning here goes like this – the Segwit2x chain will quickly accumulate the most mining power, making the original bitcoin unprofitable (or unmanagable) to mine, and ensuring a total migration.  Yet, that's not to say all these miners will eventually run the code.  While more complex, the reasons why include:  Many back bitcoin cash. Bitcoin's China-based community tends to be more invested in this bitcoin alternative, which already increases block size to 8 MB.  Miners aren't likely to act unilaterally. Signatories like ViaBTC and BTC.Top are mining pools that primarily sell software subscriptions to other miners. This means that they will likely give users the option to mine Segwit2x, but all of their users aren't guaranteed to switch over.  Some miners aren't supporting. This includes F2pool (which governs 5.6 percent of the network) and Slushpool (responsible for 7.3 percent), both of whom have said (with varying degrees of certainty) that they won't run the code.  Also of importance here will be the perceived value of a Segwit2x cryptocurrency.  Already, exchanges are experimenting by listing a version of the coin – one that lives only on their order books – as a way to test the value.  At press time, the value of the new version of bitcoin was estimated at just over $1,000, double the price of bitcoin cash ($450) and much higher than bitcoin gold ($130).  When will all this occur?  But while there remain many ifs, one thing we do know is the fork will occur on or around Nov. 16.  However, an exact date can't be pinned down. This is because the change will be enacted at a specific block (number 494,784), at which time miners will be able to run the new software.  Still, those involved with the project are adamant that it is moving forward, with the project's lead developer stating just last week that the updated code will be released based on the mid-November plan.
