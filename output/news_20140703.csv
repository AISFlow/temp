42397745,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE3GK,1404424252,Spike in Silk Road Interest No Boon for Ross Ulbricht Defense Fund,"Despite the rise in media attention surrounding Friday's auction of roughly 30,000 BTC seized from Silk Road, a website seeking to clear the name of the online black market's alleged leader, 30-year-old Ross Ulbricht, is not reporting any increase in donations.  The bitcoins sold in the most recent auction were confiscated from the Silk Road website when it was seized by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) last October. Notably, the US Marshals auction, of which VC Tim Draper emerged as the winner, did not include 144,000 BTC held by Ulbricht. Those bitcoins are the subject of an ongoing lawsuit, though they could eventually end up at auction.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Ross Ulbricht's mother Lyn Ulbricht said that FreeRoss.org, the legal defense fund she helps manage for her son, saw a higher level of views in the days surrounding the auction, but no increase in financial support.  Lyn Ulbricht told CoinDesk:  ""We have not had any noticeable uptick in legal fund donations from the auction, although some people are tweeting that it would be nice if Tim Draper would throw some bitoin our way!""  FreeRoss.org is currently seeking to increase awareness of how it believes a Ross Ulbricht convinction could negatively affect all Web users by changing underlying aspects of the law that protect major companies such as eBay and Amazon.  $17,000 donation  Lyn Ulbricht said that FreeRoss.org has been gathering momentum of late, but that this was largely the result of the Porcupine Freedom Festival (PorcFest), an annual libertarian-leaning summer gathering held in Lancaster, New Hampshire.  Lyn Ulbricht said that FreeRoss.org saw an ""influx of donations"" owing to her speaking role at the event, and that one individual donated 28.7 BTC (roughly $18,000 at press time and $17,000 on the day it was exchanged for fiat) to the effort.  She added:  ""That made our hardworking lawyer very happy. I wish I knew who this generous person was so I could thank them.""  Ross Ulbricht, who was arrested and later charged with a number of crimes stemming from his alleged operation of Silk Road, is currently residing in New York's Metropolitan Detention Center, where he awaits trial. The charges listed in the original indictment would, at minimum, land Ulbricht a 30-year prison sentence.  For more on the FreeRoss.org effort, read our most recent report.

42397746,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE3II,1404420311,Latin American Bitcoin Startup Moneero Exits Stealth Mode,"Uruguay-headquartered bitcoin startup Moneero has officially exited stealth mode, and announced that its debut wallet services are open to an initial batch of users.  The news coincides with the launch of the company's currency agnostic banking system, Moneero ROX, a tool Moneero says allows it to manage accounts and subaccounts in a variety of currencies, including bitcoin, litecoin, Ripple, fiat and smart property.  Speaking to CoinDesk, chief product officer and co-founder Steven Morell told CoinDesk that ROX will allow Moneero to one day extend its full suite of finished services - including a planned ATM service and FX trading platform - to users in any country around the globe and to remain compliant with local laws.  Comparing ROX to a set of Lego pieces that rearrange to suit many differing needs, Morell said:  ""In Hong Kong, you can do transactions up to HK$8,000 without verifying yourself. In Uruguay, the threshold is U$3,000. What we can do with ROX is that in Uruguay, the moment someone in Uruguay uses Moneero, a different set of [AML and KYC] rules apply to him.""  He added: ""This means we can rapidly adjust to regulation in every part of the world"".  Moneero is a continuation of the previously announced project BTC Global. Morell maintains that the rebranding was needed for both legal reasons and to stress the ongoing evolution of the previous brand's ideas.  BTC Global had previously aimed to introduce a Massive Parallel Licensing (MPL) program, which it aimed to use to address onerous exchange regulations. Moneero's founders include Morell, Vladimir Marchenko and Mauro Betschart  Social vision  Though Morell did not provide many details on the offering, he indicated that what might be the cornerstone of the company's vision is the development of Moneero Social, its product that will allow users to send bitcoins to friends and followers on various social networks.  Morell stressed that it is in this area that Moneero hopes to improve access to bitcoin, citing how for many younger users around the globe, the Internet is now purely mobile and social.  ""There are people selling fish on Facebook, and there are sheepherders selling sheep on Instagram. In the next five years, anywhere between three billion and five billion people will get on the internet and they all will get into an internet in different ways than the one you and I know.""  Morell explained how the company's API will connect to what it calls ""ThinApps"", applications that don't have their own business logic and that don't store data. It is these apps, he said, that will be used to help it roll out its Facebook and Twitter apps and previously announced SMS and bitcoin ATM initiatives.  The product follows the launch of Facebook-integrated wallet QuickCoin, which arrived to great user enthusiasm in May.  When asked how Moneero aims to educate these users, who may be new to bitcoin, Morell also refrained from offering specifics, stating that the company is currently in talks with potential partners that possess the large number of users it would need to jumpstart its initiative.  Wallet offerings  To start, Moneero will not provide bitcoin buying and selling services, but rather introduce two wallet products, the PlayWallet – which requires users to provide no identification – and the OptiWallet, which it describes as a secure multisig wallet. The company plans to use an exchange partner, at least initially.  OptiWallet aims to solve a common pain point for bitcoin users owing to the importance of keeping coins in cold storage for safe-keeping. Morell said OptiWallet will allow users to spend bitcoins that they have in cold storage by taking out loans from Moneero.  Morell said that these extensions will later be repaid by users:  ""You can spend your money while it's stored securely. At the end of the month, we send you an account bill and take back what you borrowed.""  Moneero also plans to provide a bitcoin test wallet for the development community, and expects more features to roll out in the coming weeks.

42397747,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE3HJ,1404417015,Bitfin Day One: Circle Talks P2P Payments and Isle of Man Details Bitcoin Plans,"Day one of the Bitcoin Finance 2014 Conference and Expo (Bitfin) in Dublin today featured discussion on the basics of bitcoin, the wider opportunities of digital currency and a world first.  Jeremy Allaire  kicked off the first day's events with a talk focused on digital currency's potential to revolutionise traditional financial systems. The Circle CEO explained in his opening keynote speech that bitcoin is creating new standards for global consumer finance, but it still has a long way to go to ""cross the chasm"" and enter the mainstream.  Allaire explained that he's particularly interested in developments in person-to-person payment services that utilise digital currency, stating:  ""Person-to-person payments present a huge opportunity and I believe that, in five-to-10 years, sending money person-to-person will be as common as text messaging.""  Bitfin 2014  is taking place at the Royal Dublin Society (RDS) in the east of Ireland's capital city, the two-day conference is hosting around 300 attendees.  A bitcoin milestone  Today's panel sessions and presentations were very much aimed at educating delegates about bitcoin and other digital currencies, with the morning sessions including talks titled 'Introduction to Bitcoin', 'Common Questions About Bitcoin', and 'the Economics of Bitcoin'.  However, the main event offered something new, even for established industry observers. Gareth Murphy, director of markets at the Central Bank of Ireland, took the stage in the afternoon, becoming the first government-backed bank representative to speak at a digital currency conference.  In his session, he explored the innovation bitcoin could bring to global finance, but also highlighted the negative pressure it could apply to economies. He said:  “Central banks, [out] of necessity, have monopolized the exercise of these functions. Virtual currencies pose new challenges to central banks’ control over these important functions.”  Murphy went on to say that, while some countries are widening existing laws to include bitcoin, it is possible that specific legislation relating to digital currencies could be created in the not-so-distant future.  Local leaders debate regulation  A legal and regulatory panel further explored this theme later in the day, with panel members from Circle and the finance committee of the States of Alderney, the Government of the Isle of Man and the UK Digital Currency Association sharing their views – moderated by Paul Rodgers of Vendorcom.  The panellists discussed their views on how bitcoin regulation should be developed and which region or nation should or could take the lead.  Peter Greenhill, from the government of the Isle of Man, said he feels bitcoin could really start to boom in smaller jurisdictions, as the process of progressing legislation through parliament is much quicker and less complicated than it is in larger states.  He added that since his government announced it is to set up a licensicng scheme/register, it has received a lot of interest from bitcoin companies across the world looking to relocate to the island.  CoinDesk senior sub-editor Grace Caffyn later moderated a panel on investing in bitcoin. Panellists Jeremy Kandah of TeamBlockChain, Karl Gray of StartJoin and Christina Gorlick of CloudHashing joined Nic Cary of Blockchain and Simon Dixon of BankToTheFuture.com.  Concluding remarks  The closing keynote was delivered by Colm Lyon, CEO of Realex, a European payment service provider. Lyon's company processes 45 payments per second on behalf of 12,500 businesses, processing around EUR 28bn per year.  He said that if he had to summarise the current payments market in one word, he would say ""mayhem"".  Lyon believes that bitcoin is just what the current system needs, explaining that it's completely separate from the existing system and not just another product on top of it. He believes the development of bitcoin as a payment system will bring much needed competition to the space and, ultimately, provide better services for consumers and businesses.  Tomorrow, the conference will feature talks by BTC China CEO and Bitcoin Foundation board member Bobby Lee, Jumio sales director David Pope and Stripe CTO Greg Brockman. Additionally, panel discussions will focus on such topics as the potential applications for bitcoin in traditional banking and improving consumer access to bitcoin.

42397753,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE3ND,1404414024,5 Global Problems Bitcoin's Proof of Work Can Help Solve,"It is possible that when compared to rare metals, bitcoin mining is not as wasteful in terms of environmental impact, but it remains clear that there could be better and more efficient uses of cryptocurrency mining power than solving arbitrary cryptographic problems.  This belief can be seen in a number of innovative projects announced in recent weeks that seek to use bitcoin's mining power to do everything from storing genetic material to archiving important data.  This increasingly important question about the future of one of bitcoin's core industries arrives at a time industrial mining has already come to replace the network of individual miners that once powered the bitcoin network, and major voices in the industry are beginning to make their views on the matter heard.  Paul Vernon, the founder of US-based digital currency exchange Cryptsy, recently said:  “That would be something that would be really nice to have: a proof of work where the work is really doing something, solving problems.”  With this in mind, let’s take a look at some abstract and real-life problems in the world today that could benefit from the huge amount of computing power currently being generated by the bitcoin network.  1. Protein folding  Like the bitcoin network, protein folding, a process that aims to study diseases, now requires custom ASICs. But that’s because of the huge amount of computation required for this scientific process, not because of a financial incentive as in bitcoin mining.  Protein structures within the body, when improperly folded, can cause allergies and neurodegenerative disorders. While regular protein folding is normal, irregular folding of the body's proteins can result in Alzheimer's disease and certain forms of cancer, among other maladies.  Because of this, simulations of different ways that proteins can be folded provide researchers with a number of insights. It requires a lot of computational power and could use the efforts of a distributed system like the one supported by bitcoin.  2. Prime numbers  A prime number is one that is larger than 1 with no positive divisors other than 1 or itself. According to mathematical principles, there can be an infinite number of prime numbers.  That means there are still a lot of numbers to find – and that makes for a good candidate as a cryptocurrency proof of work. In fact, there is a coin – called primecoin – that is being used to find new prime numbers.  According to Coinmarketcap, primecoin ranks number 23 among all cryptocurrencies, with a market cap over $2m. Primecoin’s official website states that the network searches Cunningham chains and bi-twin chains, which it says could prove important in scientific fields such as physics.  3. SETI  The search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI, is a network of private- and government-funded projects that aims to use various scientific methods to search for intelligent life.  These projects are well known for something called SETI@Home, a distributed initiative that allows users to help find intelligent life. When looking at the details regarding SETI@Home, one begins to see the similarities between it and distributed systems such as bitcoin.  SETI@Home runs a process called signal analysis in the background of users' computers. There are over 129,000 active users contributing 676 teraflops of computational power to the system.  The question is – how much more power could be put to work if SETI established its own distributed coin?  4. Solar power  If proof of work is going to cost money in terms of electricity, then why not provide some incentive for using renewable energy?  A cryptocurrency called solarcoin grants those who own solar-generating devices one coin per megawatt-hour of energy created, thus rewarding those who provide this source of energy.  The Solarcoin Foundation plans to distribute 99% of coins to those who generate solar power. However, the concept is struggling to gain traction – that may be because even though solarcoin is only being distributed to solar facility owners, they might not be familiar with the concept of cryptocurrency.  In addition, the approximately 98 billion solarcoins are still being hashed via the scrypt proof of work algorithm, creating a drain on the system's production.  According to Coinmarketcap, solarcoin is ranked number 124 among all cryptocurencies, and its market capitalization is only $53,166, suggesting the coin currently has a very low level of adoption.  5. Climate change  Whether one believes in global warming or not, scientists are attempting to build models to see what the global climate may look like for humans in the future.  It is an ambitious study – something that requires a lot of computational power in order to build models that take into account the massive amounts of physical data collected by scientists.  There are a few distributed projects that are tackling the problem of forecasting climate. The most popular, called Climate@Home and spearheaded by NASA, has amassed 28.7 gigaflops of computing power.  The system uses distributed computers to perform “mathematical equations that quantitatively describe how atmospheric temperature, air pressure, winds, water vapor, clouds, precipitation and other factors all respond to the Sun's heating of the Earth's surface and atmosphere,” according to Climate@Home’s website.  Potential solutions  The SETI@Home and Climate@Home projects use an open source system called the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC). And there actually is a cryptocurrency available now that utilizes BOINC projects as a proof of work.  It's called gridcoin, and it allows users to obtain block rewards from signing up to use CPU power for BOINC projects.  Users can choose the BOINC initiative that they want to contribute – it could be life science, mathematics or software testing, among other numerous projects – and be rewarded for their portion of computational work.  Gridcoin uses the scrypt algorithm to confirm transactions, but the system requires any miner participating to join a BOINC project.  “We aim to justify our carbon production in the form of being the first scientific philanthropic cryptocurrency,” the gridcoin website states.  The energy requirements and environmental impact of traditional proof of work mining cannot be ignored. ASIC chips for cyrptocurrency mining require ever-growing amounts of power, and once a mining rig is rendered obsolete it is destined for the scrap pile.  So, whether it is solving real-world problems or theoretical ones, there are efficiency gains to be had with cryptocurrency proof of work.  The question is: what is the right function for putting hashing power to good use?

42397739,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE3CO,1404408632,VoidSpace Aims To Let Gamers Mine Dogecoin – With Lasers,"Nikolas Gauvreau has his fingers crossed this month. The founder of Universal Projects is halfway through his Kickstarter campaign, although he has only raised a little over 5% of his $275,000 target. Gauvreau is developing a game that will let players ‘mine’ dogecoin, without a hardware mining rig in sight.  He has been working on his brainchild for 17 years. Called VoidSpace, it is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), set in a massive space universe, that is almost entirely empty when the user first arrives. Players proceed to jet around the universe, mining raw natural resources.  They can use the natural resources they collect to build manufacturing facilities and create more sophisticated items. They can also trade goods and raw materials with each other.  They can also club together in alliances, and take on other groups of players.  It's a little like the online space role-playing game Eve Online, but there are many differences. The game is ‘organic’, with many variations on different objects. The universe also scales in size, getting larger as more players enter it.  Other online games generally use their own in-game currencies. Eve Online has the ISK, while World Of Warcraft has gold (virtual, not physical). But the Ottawa, Canada-based programmer said he is adopting dogecoin as his in-game currency.  “We want to allow people to use it for real money transactions too. So players can create their own in-game currencies, but they will always be able to use dogecoins for transactions between players.”  Mining dogecoin in-game  Gauvreau is experimenting with a couple of options for dogecoin in the game. The first involves ‘mining’ dogecoins as a natural resource, scattered throughout the universe.  Players are allowed to use the coins as a method of payment to enter the game. He explained:  “The coins will then be distributed among the world as a mineable resource. So you can collect dogecoins via the mining process, or trade other players and kill them and loot what they have already mined.”  The second option involves using doge for financial transactions, where players can trade goods with each other.  We have seen online gaming companies flirt with cryptocurrencies before. Casual gaming firm Zynga, for example, flirted with bitcoin as a means of taking in-app payments. But there haven't been many games that have integrated cryptocurrencies intimately.  One such game is more or less simply a mining client for the cryptocurrency. In huntercoin, the cryptocurrency and the game are effectively one and the same. A 2-D map, displayed in the client, enables people to compete with each other, traversing the landscape with their characters, to find coins that spawn randomly.  Players can race with and destroy other players to collect coins. Their successes and failures are recorded in the huntercoin block chain, and the coins are traded.  When game currencies meet cryptocurrencies  Peter Earle, chief economist at cryptocurrency marketing firm Humint, has studied virtual economies, particularly in the gaming world.  “What's interesting about game economies is that they are a really ripe area for exploration,” he said, adding that they can be petri-dishes for economic theory.  “It's so much better than, say, modelling. You have real people interacting and you can watch the effects of their choices, and capital flows, and how they react to inflation, and so on.”  One danger of bringing a currency into a game environment with utility outside is that one domain can pollute the other.  Is it fair, for example, for someone with a large stash of dogecoin to come in and buy up resources that other players would have to work weeks to attain?  Perhaps not, but you could also argue that that's how real markets work. In any case, Gauvreau hopes that the game design will mitigate those imbalances to some degree. He said:  “The thing is that this is something you’d want to worry about in an MMO, but VoidSpace is different in a number of ways.”  The potential size of the game will stop people from being able to buy their way to kingpin status, he argued. There won’t be a central location in the game to go and trade with people. And the universe can scale to such a size that players will easily be able to escape high-rollers if they want to move to a different part of the universe.  In any case, as he points out, other games have had similar problems, even with their own in-game currencies.  World of Warcraft, for example, suffered from gold farmers. These real-world workers would sit tirelessly playing the game, becoming experts and relentlessly owning gold which could then be sold on real-life exchanges. Many of them worked in Asia, where earning potential and cost of living are relatively low, making it a profitable enterprise.  These ventures worked because there were real-world exchanges on which people could buy and sell World of Warcraft gold, or assets owned in the game. Economics, like nature, abhors a vacuum and will work to fill it.  In this case, it bridges the gap between real and imagined markets (and honestly, in a world of derivatives, non-asset-backed units of exchange and paperless money, it is sometimes difficult to tell the difference).  Getting dogecoin in and out of the metaverse  Dogecoin won’t be the only way to pay for participation in VoidSpace. Users will also be able to pay with a straightforward PayPal transaction. But if they want to begin the game with dogecoin, then they will have to make their payment to VoidSpace through cryptographic payments platform Moolah.  Using Moolah also enables Gauvreau to accept other forms of cryptocurrency that can be converted to dogecoin, including bitcoin. If players earn dogecoin in the game, they must also withdraw it via Moolah.  Gauvreau has a long way to go. He has two weeks to reach over a quarter of $1m, and is nowhere near that target. He gets none of the $15,000 that he has raised at the time of writing unless he hits that final target.  But the game isn't going away, said Gauvreau, who has spent the last 18 months working full time on the game with no income, after leaving his job coding for a telecommunications company.  “It would drag the timeline out a little bit,” he said, explaining that the $275,000 fundraising target is what he needs to complete the game. That's roughly 50% open source at the moment.  “Timelines are based on when we get that amount. If it takes longer to get that amount and we have to go through investors, then that’s as long as it will take.”  The game has just been given the green light for distribution on the Steam video game network, boosting his enthusiasm to get it done.  His plight brings to mind the documentary Indie Game, in which three sets of independent game developers go against all odds to release their titles.  Approaching angel investors would be the next stop, and he would also have to take up part time work, but he’s not fazed.  “This is something that I have been devoting my life to since I was 16. I have no intention of letting this go ever,” he said.  Dogecoin started as a joke, and Gauvreau’s serious.

42425860,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgVHh,1404401718,Independent Scotland Could be 'Cryptocurrency Testbed',"Guy Debelle, the assistant governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), believes Scotland could become a testbed for cryptocurrencies if it gains independence from the UK.  Debelle's remarks were addressed to the audience at the Financial Times Camp Alphaville event in London, in a rather unconventional fashion for a banker: in a T-shirt, speaking through a telepresence robot.  Independent Scotland, Debelle reasoned, has a compelling reason to consider the option, as if the Scots vote for independence this September, they will be “short a currency”.  Debelle said:  ""The Scots can go back to experimenting with a multitude of currencies, bitcoin and the like, and we can just sit back and see how it goes.""  Bitcoin could also be challenged by local alternative digital currency scotcoin, which was introduced amid a boom in country-specific coins issued early this year.  Experimenting with free banking  At the event, Debelle also elaborated on Scotland's economic history.  For instance, he noted that Scotland has a “bit of experience” with competing currencies dating back in the 18th and 19th centuries. He recalled a brief period in Scotland’s history when the country was able to issue its own currencies, independent of the Crown.  Though, he notes that this trial was ultimately unsuccessful:  ""They tried this in the 18th and 19th centuries. It worked for a while, but eventually it fell apart.""  However, a number of panellists disagreed with Debelle’s comments, although they were open to the idea of Scotland experimenting with digital currencies, The Guardian reports.  Even Debelle admitted he is not willing to forecast the demise of cash just yet.  Competition vs government monopoly  Kevin Dowd, the author of a recently published paper on bitcoin, agrees with Debelle and believes Scotland’s past banking experiment was in some ways a success.  Dowd’s paper, published by the Institute of Economic Affairs, argues that the UK should effectively privatise the pound and liberalise the monetary system, thus introducing competition in what has been a government monopoly for centuries.  Dowd says that the process would loosely resemble the privatisation of the telecom sector, which brought about a lot of innovation along with better services and lower prices.  Entrepreneur David Galbraith, one of the co-creators of Yelp and RSS, disagreed, however, saying innovation in payments will not happen directly. He pointed out that there are hundreds of payment start-ups today, but nearly all of them are trying to build new services on existing platforms.  He also believes the need to control the protocol renders bitcoin irrelevant in a hypothetical Scottish independence scenario.

42425848,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgV1h,1404397722,Irish Central Banker Envisions Hybrid Bitcoin-Fiat Future,"Speaking at the Bitcoin Finance 2014 Conference and Expo in Dublin today, Gareth Murphy, director of markets for the Central Bank of Ireland, made history becoming the first government-backed bank representative to speak at a digital currency conference.  Despite his presence amongst many of the technology's most avid supporters, Murphy used his address to both foretell of the innovation bitcoin could bring to global finance, while warning that the bitcoin community, too, needs to be cognizant of the added pressures their advancement may bring to global economies.  Addressing the crowd, Murphy said:  ""Central banks, [out] of necessity, have monopolized the exercise of these functions. Virtual currencies pose new challenges to central banks’ control over these important functions.""  Though he recognized that economies often function with multiple currencies, with USD being a frequently used store of value internationally, Murphy noted that bitcoin would subvert the ability of central banks in the areas of data collection, economic analysis, policy formation, regulation, supervision, enforcement and resolution – and further, that the implications of such a change should not be overlooked.  On the subject of regulation, Murphy suggested that the bitcoin community should not assume that its actions will continue to fall under existing regulations as they are in the US, Switzerland and other parts of the world. However, he suggested that regulation would not necessarily be needed to control or suppress bitcoin, but rather to support unknown innovations that may result from the technology's wider use.  He stated:  ""We should not presume that current regulations are future-proof. It is possible that further innovations will mean that these regulations may no longer apply. This suggests that new regulations may ultimately be needed which are based on new legal concepts with a clear scope which must stand the test of time.""  Held from 3rd-4th July at the Royal Dublin Society, BitFin 2014 will also feature appearances by BTC China CEO and Bitcoin Foundation board member Bobby Lee, Circle CTO Sean Neville and Blockchain CEO Nicolas Cary.  Thought experiment  To begin his talks, Murphy invited gathered attendees to join him on a thought experiment that envisioned a world in which digital currencies are used for payments in ""a substantial amount"" of goods and services.  Murphy said:  ""In effect, economic activity is the aggregate of domestic transactions in the 'euro-denominated economy' and the 'virtual currency economy'.""  In continuation, Murphy suggested four reasons why this dual economy may be likely to form, including the ease with which bitcoin can unite global consumers and merchants, the low cost of bitcoin payments, the openness of consumers to new innovations and the growing influence of technology companies.    Ireland's Gareth Murphy makes history at #BitFin as the first central banker to speak at a bitcoin conference pic.twitter.com/0dxgg1QJrG      — CoinDesk (@coindesk) July 3, 2014      Bitcoin could threaten banks  Perhaps most notably, Murphy suggested that as digital currencies permeate economic activity, banks and major financial institutions are likely to feel the effects.  The comments come amid a rush of recent reports from major financial institutions that suggest they do not view bitcoin as an immediate risk to their operations.  In his remarks, however, Murphy suggests that, in his view, these organisations would be unwise to adopt this approach to the technology, stating:  ""This is likely to have a profound operational impact on these firms and their regulatory risk profile.""  Economic and monetary challenges  In this new hybrid economy, Murphy said central banks would face challenges first in regard to their statistical measurements of economic activity. Though a seemingly small detail, Murphy stressed that ""the range of purposes for which national accounting measures are used in the stewardship of economies"" should not be underestimated.  Digital currencies, Murphy continued, also challenge the way central banks calibrate monetary policy, exchange rates and set the price of credit. A development that he said would need to be ""closely monitored"".  He added:  ""The existence of a ‘euro-denominated economy’ and a ‘virtual currency economy’ raises the prospect of an internal balance of payments between two sub-economies where suppliers may prefer one currency over another as a means of payment (for different goods and services).""  Murphy went on to cite the implications bitcoin could have for government control over taxes, maintaining the payment infrastructure, ensuring consumer protection and anti-money laundering.

BitComp, which launched last month, is a small MIT-wide competition aimed at encouraging bitcoin innovation among students.  The aim of the MIT Bitcoin Project is to make bitcoin more accessible to students at the noted Massachusetts educational institute, and raise awareness of the new technology. It will fully kick off later this fall, when each MIT undergraduate student will receive $100 in bitcoin.  Rewarding innovation  In the competition, the MIT students, or teams of up to five members (which can include non-MIT members), were asked to submit a 250-word pitch for a bitcoin project.  The top three projects of this first round, which were announced today, have received a symbolic reward of $250.  Round two will award three $750 prizes, while the third and final round offers the opportunity to win five $1,500 prizes and a $5,000 grand prize. It is still not too late to sign up and there's still more than $14,000 up for grabs.  In total, 82 undergraduates, 20 graduate students and 14 alumni took part in the first round of the competition, along with a single high school student. Their pitches were judged by 12 bitcoin community members, including executives and bitcoin evangelists.  Joi Ito  , Director of the MIT Media Lab, and Christian Catalini, Assistant Professor of Technological Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Strategic Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, served as final round judges.  And the winners are ...  The three teams that stood out came up with very different projects.  Computer students Tiffany Wong and Pavleen Thurkal developed BitTax, which helps legitimize cryptocurrencies by providing a way for users to correctly file bitcoin related taxes. The team said they want to be a part of bringing bitcoin to mainstream users in a responsible, legitimate way.  Amir Lazarovich, Oz Nathan and Guy Zyskind developed Ethos, which uses block chain technology to decentralize online identities, ""allowing people to regain control and ownership of their own data"".  Rafael Pass, Robert Parks and Lior Seeman won their reward for the sWallet, which is an effort to develop a more secure, yet easy-to-use wallet. They believe practical and secure wallets are ""crucial to achieving mainstream bitcoin adoption"".  The deadline for the submission of round two projects is July 27, while entrants to the third and final round need to submit their projects by August 24.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/03/mit-bitcoin-project-announces-first-round-competition-winners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54bdd01813eeddb9a69cc9f5436a64b915e01d07-998x664.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425850,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgUvh,1404389874,Overstock Dangles Rewards For Bitcoin-Friendly Vendors,"Overstock hopes to encourage bitcoin use with a range of incentives for vendors who decide to accept payments in the digital currency.  Speaking in a podcast at the libertarian Porcupine Freedom Festival, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne said, “We’re going to start giving sort of special deals to the vendors who want to be paid in bitcoin.""  This could mean offering discounts and favourable terms to vendors selling through the Overstock platform if they start to accept bitcoin, he indicated, adding that the company may also reward those who already accept the digital currency.  Notably, Byrne also said his company may also offer its employees the option to get paid in bitcoin.  In the podcast, Byrne stressed that he is committed to the “crypto-revolution” and the discounts are being considered “very seriously”, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Bitcoin fan  Byrne has repeatedly made it clear that he is a firm advocate of bitcoin and Overstock’s decision to embrace the cryptocurrency seems to be no publicity stunt.  Last month Byrne said Overstock would set aside 3% of its bitcoin profits for advocacy organisations that promote digital currencies. Byrne has also put his money where his mouth, claiming to hold “several million” dollars in bitcoin.  As for the new initiative, Byrne is looking at the big picture:  “It’s all about building. If we can get employees taking it, and vendors taking it, and customers paying for it, then it all becomes a virtuous circle.”  Boost to bitcoin  In May, Byrne said the company had processed $1.6m in bitcoin sales since it started accepting bitcoin in January. Earlier this year, Byrne said Overstock’s bitcoin sales could hit as much as $10-20m, but figures have slightly dropped off in recent weeks.  Whether Byrne's desire to build a supply chain of bitcoin-friendly vendors will boost retail sales is yet to be seen, but it should at least bring yet more retail options to the bitcoin community.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MINING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/03/overstock-dangles-rewards-for-bitcoin-friendly-vendors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b1ed7fd6e89c56547ac6f278ecd1ab9d2c127abd-1000x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425856,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgVDh,1404381977,Free Multi-Signature API Could Help Boost Bitcoin App Security,"It's just become much easier for developers and startups to boost the security of their bitcoin products and services.  A new multi-signature API has been released by BlockCypher, a Boost VC-backed startup, allowing anybody to easily add the security-enhancing feature to their own applications.  Multi-signature transactions involve multiple parties who are required to provide consensus in order to authenticate a transaction – an escrow-like situation operating on the block chain.  BlockCypher  's founder and CEO Catheryne Nicholson told CoinDesk that the API is a way to provide a secure infrastructure for startups in the bitcoin ecosystem, freeing them to focus on user experience:  ""If bitcoin is going to hit the mainstream, all of the applications built on the protocol need to be simpler and more user friendly. It's never going to reach mass adoption if my grandmother or my kids can't figure out how to use a wallet or how to buy and sell bitcoins.""  Time saver  Nicholson suggested that if bitcoin startups didn't have to devote as much time and resources to building a secure infrastructure, companies could instead focus on improving user experience, whether they're building a wallet, exchange or any other type of application using the block chain.  With her background in enterprise software platforms, it was clear to Nicholson that part of the reason we haven't seen more user-friendly applications built on the bitcoin protocol is because developers are spending most of their time focusing on security.  Nicholson isn't alone in thinking that multisig functionality could help free up developers to build better user interfaces.  While delivering the 'Annual State of Bitcoin' address at the Bitcoin 2014 conference in Amsterdam back in May, the Bitcoin Foundation's chief scientist Gavin Andresen predicted the emergence of ""better looking"" products:  ""I think wallets will be nicer, I think user interfaces will be polished, I think it will be, you know, much more secure. I think multisignature will go a long way for that.""  Until now, implementing multisig functionality has proven to be a timesuck for developers. Nicholson attributes this to the difficulty of executing the transactions with the pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) function.  Much-needed security  The multisig approach to transactions on the block chain has been lauded by many in the community as a way to enhance consumer protection and prevent fraudulent spending.  This type of functionality is essential in bringing bitcoin to mass adoption, Nicholson argued:  ""There's all types of stories about people selling their houses and cars for bitcoin, but nobody in their right mind is actually going to transfer $1m in bitcoin without arbiters or a third party involved. Multisig provides security for these types of transactions, which is essential in the digital world.""  Nicholson reaffirmed that the multisig API is written so that neither her nor BlockCypher ever hold the private keys of its users, to ensure funds cannot be stolen.  Free for now  Startups like web wallet Pheeva and Amazon-focused bitcoin marketplace Purse.io are already using BlockCypher's cloud services, and Nicholson said both teams were excited over the news of the multisig API.  Indeed, Purse.io users may see multisig functionality added to the service sooner rather than later, with Nicholson explaining that she's already heard from the company about its plans to use the new API.  Developers hoping to implement multisig into their products or services can expect the traditionally arduous process to take just an hour using the multisig API, which Nicholson said also works for the litecoin protocol.  The multisig API is available free of charge for anyone to use, as Nicholson stressed that immediate profit isn't her primary focus:  ""Like any API company, we'll start thinking about profit once there's a significant amount of people using our software that are making money off of it.""
