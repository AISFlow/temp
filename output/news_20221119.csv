4493240,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509357,1668887542,"Toncoin (TON) Continues To Mark Higher Gains, Big Move Coming?","Toncoin has defied the entire crypto market sentiment as its value continues to trend higher. As per CoinMarketCap data, the native token of the TON blockchain has kept over 20% gain in the last seven days. The token has experienced extreme volatility in the last 24 hours, though. And it’s not just on the last day alone. Earlier this week, popular hardware wallet, SafePal announced support for the TON blockchain and its native currency, TON. According to the blog post on its official website, the hardware wallet provider will include Toncoin in its list of supported cryptocurrencies before 2022 ends. This means users can now safely store their cryptocurrency holdings using the SafePal device. Related Reading: OKB Token Records Higher Gains Amidst Crypto Market Volatility The TON community has also been bullish following the launch of Telegram’s username auction service. So far, users have shown great interest in buying names like ‘alfa,’ ‘dogecoin,’ and ‘amazon.’ The auction service was launched by the company earlier this month. It allows users to buy or sell unique TON-based usernames. SafePal To Support Toncoin By The End Of 2022, Token Rises Then Dumps SafePal announced plans to add support for the TON Blockchain’s native currency, Toncoin, by the end of 2022. The announcement was made on November 17th on its official Twitter page and website. According to the post, SafePal will be the first cold wallet to support the native token. It also mentioned that it’d provide offline storage for the token. In addition to this, SafePal said that it would enable users to send and receive Toncoins from any other wallet. The integration was prompted by the recent interest in the TON Blockchain. As per the blog post, the integration will also be implemented on SafePal’s software wallet offering. However, they didn’t specify a date when the feature would be available. It only mentioned that it’d be rolled out before the end of Q4 2022. After the November 17th announcement, Toncoin’s price started surging. It rose by almost 8%, from $1.69 to $1.82, before retracting for the day. However, the surge didn’t last well enough the following day as it saw a price drop. Luckily, the drop wasn’t severe, and the token still bounced back to continue its rally. Toncoin Analysis – Where The Token Is Headed Despite fluctuating between highs and lows at press time, the TON token has continued to rise steadily since this week started. The overall crypto market sentiment has been bearish, but the TON token has bucked the trend. It’s currently trading at around $1.78, up by over 11% in the past 7 days. Related Reading: This Crypto Venture Capital Loses Almost $1B On FTX, When Will This FTX Fiasco End? However, the token hasn’t faired too well in terms of the trading volume. In the last 24 hours, activities have slowed down by over 50%. While this isn’t alarming, it does indicate that traders might be slowing down on the Telegram username auctions. But this hasn’t stopped the token’s price from rising. In the coming days, it’s yet to be seen if the token will sustain its current momentum.

The utility token saw a price surge of 4.63% on the day, registering a local high of $20.80. It also surged over 11% on its weekly chart, joining the likes of Toncoin and Trust Wallet Token to lead the market in gains. There’s no major catalyst for OKB’s surge on the day. However, a 20.32% uptick in its trading volume suggests that users have been quite busy. It might have something to do with the exchange’s announcement of adjusting the position tiers of its perpetual swaps and futures. Related Reading: MATIC Backpedals Into Bearish Track Despite Its Social Dominance Furthermore, OKX joined the likes of Binance to announce a recovery fund for projects struggling with liquidity. This comes after popular crypto exchange FTX ran into liquidity issues that saw it lock users out of their funds. The exchange’s announcement was a major factor in OKB’s weekly price surge. OKX Announces Project Recovery Funds, OKB Starts Bullish Run Earlier this week, OKX announced its intentions to establish a $100 million project ecological support plan. According to the tweet, OKX will work with OKXChain and OKX Demo Day on the project. OKX intends to assist high-quality projects currently struggling with issues like liquidity. The cryptocurrency exchange believes it’s essential to help projects migrate seamlessly. Furthermore, it plans to offer qualifying projects financial, ecological, and technical support to help them overcome the hurdles. Binance announced a similar venture on Monday after FTX’s debacle pushed the crypto market downward. The world’s largest crypto exchange plans to use its recovery fund project to help longstanding successful projects recover from liquidity issues. Justin Sun, the creator of Tron, and Huobi, a cryptocurrency exchange, endorsed Binance’s recovery fund. According to Justin Sun, it will assist developers and builders in overcoming the issue. In addition, Simon Dixon, the largest shareholder in Celsius, intends to contribute to the fund to revive the sector. After OKX’s announcement on November 15th, the OKB token surged 8.74%. It has continued its climb since then, pushing the token to a new weekly high. How OKB Has Fared During The Week The price of OKB has increased by 4.63% to $20.68 in the last day. This maintains the upward trajectory it has been on for the previous week, rising from $18.5 to its present price by 11.39%. The coin’s all-time high is $44.01, a 53.17% rise from its current market price. The chart displays the price volatility and movement for OKB over the previous week. The Bollinger Bands in gray represent the volatility of its weekly price changes. The greater the bands’ width or the size of the gray area at any given time, the greater the volatility.

The rapid fall of FTX will potentially extend the crypto bear market by several more months, or perhaps through the end of 2023, according to a recent research report by Coinbase Global ( COIN ). Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX, which was once the world’s second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume and valued to the tune of $32B, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. last week following the discovery of its $8B balance sheet shortfall, among other missteps like misjudging users' margin, that resulted in a colossal amount of outflows. The week-long meltdown has escalated into growing concerns of potential systemic risk and left the sector vulnerable amid a shortage in large buyers, Coinbase said. While FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings will be closely monitored, Coinbase noted that the direction of the crypto asset class will also depend on how the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate policy plays out. But with inflation still at extraordinarily high levels and the labor market staying tight, “it’s still too early for a Fed pivot,” the centralized crypto exchange contended. Nevertheless, current efforts to make exchanges more transparent (proof of reserves), regulatory collaboration, and assisting investigators to recoup any missing customer funds “are the important steps to take and will have a greater impact on the market than certain macroeconomic factors,” Vincenzo Toppi, partner in the CohnReznick Advisory Restructuring and Dispute Resolution Practice, told Seeking Alpha via email. Coinbase said it expects the crypto space to see “second order effects” come to light from the unraveling of FTX, “as it emerges which counterparties may have lent or interacted with either FTX or Alameda and what those exact liabilities are.” Keep in mind that Alameda Research was SBF’s quantitative trading firm that played a key role in the demise of the 30-year-old’s crypto empire. Bradley Duke, founder and CEO at ETC Group, agrees with Coinbase’s assessment, saying “there is little doubt that the FTX collapse will delay the crypto spring,” adding “investor confidence in crypto has taken a severe knock and the aftershocks from this event will continue to be felt for some time.” The Brian Armstrong-led firm also reckons that poor liquidity conditions could last through at least the end of 2022, as the dominance of stablecoins (digital tokens whose value is tied to another asset like the U.S. dollar) continues to take more share of the deteriorating crypto market cap, now standing at 18% versus around 5% in October 2021. Elsewhere in the cryptoverse, the bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining landscape has been undergoing pain, well before the fall of FTX, as a rise in the network hashrate and energy costs along with depressed BTC prices squeeze miner’s profitability. That being said, a number of BTC miners have disclosed liquidity issues in recent weeks, including Core Scientific ( CORZ ), Argo Blockchain ( ARBK ) ( OTCQX:ARBKF ) and Iris Energy ( IREN ). The FTX debacle has certainly hurt investor confidence in the space, in a move that could result in further harm in token prices and thus could add pressure to miner’s margins. The price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), meanwhile, has dropped around 20% since the FTX mess started over a week ago, trading at $16.58K as of Friday afternoon. Looking forward, “the capitulation in BTC will depend on the scale of FTX contagion,” Khaleelulla Baig, founder and CEO of KoinBasket, told Seeking Alpha. Baig sees bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) “worst case scenario” at potentially sub-$10K levels, noting “short-term implications are clearly negative while the long-term perspective looks intact. The FTX fiasco has pushed back the entire ecosystem by at least a couple of years.” Previously, (Nov. 17) John Ray III, the new FTX boss, condemned the exchange under SBF’s leadership, calling its poor management practices worse than Enron’s .",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3909763-ftx-downfall-will-could-extend-crypto-bear-market-through-end-2023-coinbase?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4486635.jpeg

42421428,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoDID,1668874467,Understanding the FTX Fallout From the Eyes of a Bitcoiner,"The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to high-profile blowups and cults of personality, and there have been several this year alone. But even by crypto standards, the FTX story is notable for the shocking revelations that have come to light. The rapid downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried is likely a watershed moment for the entire industry.  Steven Lubka, a CoinDesk columnist, is managing director of Swan Private Client Services, a concierge service for high-net-worth investors at Swan Bitcoin.  Much will be written on FTX from a mainstream point of view, and much will be written from the point of view of cryptocurrency investors. You'll hear a lot about FTX from the various venture capitalists (VC) who populate the industry and other influencers who cover decentralized finance (DeFi), Web3 and NFTs (aka non-fungible tokens).  Inevitably, the story that will be shared by crypto insiders will be ""FTX was terrible but it just displays the problems with centralized companies and highlights the benefits of decentralized protocols.""  See also: FTX Showed the Problems of Centralized Finance (and Promises of DeFi) | Opinion  What if that misses the point? The culture, norms and values of crypto had a central role in the rise (and fall) of FTX, more than these voices are likely to admit. Just take it from the bitcoin perspective.  What's up with bitcoiners?  You probably think of bitcoiners (or Bitcoin Maxis) as an odd bunch.  We look like strange fundamentalists who simply cannot wrap our minds around the innovation and possibilities inherent in digital assets other than bitcoin. We won't make any compromises and pursue a very narrow vision for how to develop and continue to grow the Bitcoin protocol.  Bitcoiners can seem like the Amish of Crypto. Weird, right? This perception of bitcoiners is cyclical: We are still coming off the heady highs of yet another crypto bull run and many still believe crypto will bounce back. At the highest moments the possibilities seemed endless, money was falling out of the sky and blockchain was going to change the world. People abandoned the basic precepts of going beyond financial intermediaries. (Why would you self-custody your coins when you can earn 10% lending through Celsius?)  Then came the blowups: Terra, Celsius Network, Three Arrows Capital, Voyager Digital (and many others only saved by bailouts and equity infusions).  The darling coins and new ideas lost 90%+ of their value. The counterparty risk suddenly reared its ugly head. Maybe the position bitcoiners take makes more sense to you now. Maybe not.  During bull runs, bitcoiners look like stubborn fools who just can't understand the possibilities. However, during bear markets, their ideals, values, and approach start to make more sense to people who do a little investigation. The culture of bitcoin, at its heart, is one of hard-won insights. Lessons learned. Money lost.  See also: Bitcoiners Were Right: Weaponized Finance Just Created a Post Dollar Planet | Opinion  In many ways, FTX validates the way bitcoiners approach this industry. Let's explore how!  Financialization  At the absolute core of Bitcoin is a single principle: we must de-financialize. This is absolutely antithetical to the entire ethos of crypto, which gives anyone the ability to instantly financialize assets. For me, this is actually the most profound divide between Bitcoin and Crypto.  Bitcoin is trying to de-financialize an overly leveraged, financialized world. Crypto is trying to further financialize everything.  Crypto wants art, music, games, login credentials and anything else they can get their hands on to become financialized. Bitcoiners think leverage, subsidization of risk and turning everything into a speculative asset is actually massively net-negative for civilization.  I'll paint you an example: houses. The real estate market is a perfect example of what financialization looks like. Houses have always been valuable, but they haven't always been financial assets in the ways they are today. As soon as the government subsidized the risk for lenders in making home loans, and the central banks made money cheap for mortgage lenders; the price of houses exploded becoming unaffordable for many.  Owning a home is an important aspect of societal cohesion. It's actually “proof-of-stake” for nations. Homeowners become stakeholders in the nation. They form families and they start to care about the long-term prospects of the nation. Financializing houses made them progressively unaffordable and undermined societal cohesion and financialization is everywhere in the contemporary economy.  FTX couldn't have existed without a culture that values financialization for its own sake. It became a popular exchange by offering traders insane leverage and the ability to collateralize almost any of their altcoin holdings (unlike many derivatives exchanges, and all spot markets). FTX also listed more exotic derivatives products than other exchanges and spent a lot of time optimizing their liquidation engine (yes, this made liquidations kinder but it also represented a push into more leverage).  Leverage is a weird thing. The optimal amount of leverage is always zero leverage, according to economists Ole Peters and Alexander Adamou. When people identify a market with low volatility and decide to take on leverage to juice returns, they end up inducing volatility into that market via the leverage itself.  See also: Why Bitcoin Has Been Highly Correlated With Fiat | Opinion  That means leverage can never work in the long term. Yes, I know you know someone who made a fortune with a risky leveraged bet over a few weeks, but structurally, over the long term, leverage can never yield structural outperformance of markets as the presence of leverage itself leads to blowups that liquidate the leveraged.  This increased volatility results in liquidations for levered players and shows the optimal leverage is always zero. FTX was an endorsement of leverage and financialization. Bankman-Fried said recently that he let it get out of hand, thinking his hedge fund could make a bigger impact if it made bigger bets.  Leverage was bad for users, bad for hedge funds and bad for FTX itself. Bitcoiners often push for full-reserve spot markets, and advise new users to stay away from leverage and to reduce their counterparty risk.  FTX was built on the opposite principles.  Glorifying wealth  The crypto community often picks its champions based on one criteria: whether they make money. FTX is what happens when we divorce wealth and success from morality and ethics. It's extremely likely that SBF at some point misappropriated customer deposits to perform ""effective altruism.""  In this sense, Bankman-Fried serves as the paragon of an industry: someone who is fine with harming others if it furthers his definition of the good. There’s a long line of influential people in crypto that came before him that essentially operated on the same principle, even if they didn’t directly steal or grift. Bankman-Fried is the culmination of contemporary crypto culture, a phenomenon enabled by VCs, media and users alike, Bankman-Fried is the output you get when your input is the contemporary values of the crypto community.  Now, that’s not to say bitcoiners are allergic to wealth or success. The difference is that wealth is good when it is generated *ethically* and *morally.* Wealth is good when it comes from providing value to the world or building something that matters.  Ethics? Morals? Here go the bitcoiners moralizing again!  I get it. Hearing about how there is a morality gap between Bitcoin and Crypto sounds like fundamentalism. But it only comes from understanding the incentives and values which are behind the past 50 years of economic change and thinning. A paradigm that saw the rise of financial service providers over industry. Financialization over value creation. And capital depletion over capital creation. In other words, postmodern finance.  Show me the incentives (I'll show you the outcome)  Glorifying financialization, amoral wealth creation and unrestricted issuance of financial instruments have created a system of incentives that enabled fraud, manipulation and deceit to happen repeatedly.  Maybe you know of a crypto founder who is acting in good faith, really believes in their project and hasn't taken advantage of their token’s issuance mechanisms in any way – wonderful! These people certainly exist.  However, empowering anyone (including anonymous founders) to issue financial instruments in a completely unrestricted manner while funding them with an endless stream of cheap VC cash has created an unsustainable system. Worse, opaque claims about “innovation” and utopian visions of a future without hierarchies enticed retail investors and created a situation with comically bad incentives. Is anyone actually surprised Sam Bankman-Fried got his start during the initial coin offering boom?  Further, the ability of a centralized team to control the issuance of a token is highly contentious. You can say tokens are a way to decentralize ownership and influence in a project, but if you look at what happens in practice instead of, in theory, you will find massively concentrated ownership among insiders.  Tokens are issued as though they were equity, and serve the exact same role for founders – that's because founders are selling tokens to fund their joint ventures. Why are securities regulated in traditional financial markets?  Because over hundreds of years we have observed time and time again that allowing people unrestricted access to the sale of financial instruments which were minted from thin air resulted in continuous abuses of power.  See also: The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin Culture | Opinion  Does that mean securities laws are perfect? Does it mean that the Securities and Exchange Commission is infallible? Of course not. But it does show us that being able to issue tokens from thin air is at the heart of so many disastrous crypto outcomes.  Regardless of what they actually are, people buy tokens believing they are a type of equity. They think they represent ownership in the protocol.  Did FTT represent ownership in FTX? ABSOLUTELY NOT! But people treated it like it did, despite being a worthless integer in a spreadsheet that FTX controlled unilaterally. FTX would not have happened if:  FTX couldn't print FTT from thin air  FTX didn't control the exchange and the prop firm (Alameda)  FTX didn't wash trade FTT to inflate its paper valuation  Borrowers didn't accept tokens printed from thin air as collateral  The entire scheme relied on FTX being able to borrow against FTT. Why? Because if it had to sell FTT the market would have gone illiquid as there were few natural buyers.  FTX used this same playbook to inflate its assets using Serum, MAPS and OXY. It discovered it could seize control of ""decentralized protocols,"" acquire a huge percentage of the supply and artificially pump the value into an illiquid market.  See also: Why Selling Some Bitcoin at a Loss Can Maximize Your Holding Potential | Opinion  DeFi, or decentralized finance, provided absolutely no protection against this. Despite creating non-custodial and verifiable protocols, DeFi has also created the cultural precedent where centralized teams of developers behind the scenes control of keys and almost always the coins. Bankman-Fried likely saw he could game this ... and did, like in the strange Sushi storyline.  Ironically, the crypto world loves to champion decentralization. They say we need decentralized protocols, decentralized exchanges, decentralized everything. But crypto loves centralized issuance of tokens. Why is no one fighting for purely decentralized issuance of these tokens?  Proof-of-work mining was designed as a fair issuance system where there are no privileged insiders and everyone competes for tokens by doing costly work. This isn't sufficient if insiders can start mining before others, but as long as there is a fair launch mining is the most decentralized way to bring a token to market.  If you remove the ability for companies and teams to issue tokens, you suck the air out of so many of these abuses.  3 core tenets, countless problems  There is more to the story, but these three core tenets are at the heart of the FTX saga: financialization, separating wealth from ethics and centralized issuance of tokens. There is a rot at the core of the cryptocurrency universe, and it is fueled by allowing these trends to propagate and fostering a culture of predation.  Ideologically, crypto was supposed to be a break from the traditional financial system, yet it has largely only succeeded in recreating some of the worst aspects of modern finance – only with fewer guardrails. Crypto is peak Wall Street, an acceleration of financialization, amoral business and the cult of personalities.  Bitcoiners fight for de-financialization, moral accrual of wealth and protocols built without centralized token issuance. This is one reason Bitcoin matters. It offers us a pathway to a new system (or perhaps a return to an older system – things weren't always like this!).  See also: The Bitcoiners Who Live 'Permanently Not There'  The FTX story will be spun as something which is fixable by DeFi. You will hear this. I don't think it's true. DeFi protocols themselves (separated from tokens, etc.) may do some things well, like enabling non-custodial financial services through programs that stick to a predetermined set of rules and are independently verifiable.  But there’s a difference between theory and practice. DeFi didn't stop FTX from capturing the decentralized exchange Serum or other protocols. Perhaps DeFiers will say, ""Well, that's not real DeFi.""

4479942,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509336,1668864750,MATIC Backpedals Into Bearish Track Despite Its Social Dominance,"The current state of MATIC and Polygon’s crypto ecosystem ranks among the worst. It took a toll on In the wake of FTX’s demise, the industry-wide contagion has impacted other projects, Polygon among them. Despite this, Polygon is in the top three DeFi companies in terms of revenue. However, Polygon and its native coin is seen to continue to bear the brunt of the pains from the collapse of FTX. Can MATIC truly rally now, as it falls to its support at $0.82 despite its social dominance? Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash On Downward Motion Since Breaching $105 Level – Here’s Why For MATIC, It’s A Narrow Market At the moment, MATIC is trading at $0.861, with a fairly narrow green candle. Indicator BB shows a point of maximum pressure at around the same price. Coupled with the bearish formation of a descending triangle, this spells doom for MATIC over the following days. Past results show that the token has also had trouble gaining traction. Available data on CoinGecko shows that MATIC is currently experiencing a losing run across all timeframes, with the monthly timeframe being the only exception, posting a gain of 2%. Image: TradingView According to CoinMarketCap’s on-chain research engine, the majority of MATIC holders are now in the red, with over 66% of the coins held in that spot. These are all bearish indications that the situation may deteriorate. Given that Polygon is an L2 for Ethereum, it is not surprising that MATIC and ETH have strong connections. Currently, the correlation coefficient between the two is 0.75. This indicates that the price movements of the two strongly correlate with one another. Investors and traders should monitor this signal, as any significant price change in ETH could aid Polygon’s comeback. Overall, though, investors and traders should anticipate MATIC to surpass $0.851 Bulls should seek support at $0.772. Bearish Breakout Expected Similar to what was stated previously, MATIC’s strong correlation with ETH can be a significant challenge for support but a significant boost for an uptrend. Despite Polygon’s social dominance, the loss of market confidence will surely cause the price of MATIC to decline. A short position at or below the current market price will mitigate the bearish market action. With the Bollinger band indicating a significant MATIC price decline, we can anticipate a bearish breakout in the next days. As that day approaches, MATIC bulls can only pray for a miracle in order for a recovery to occur.

Exchanges have been the most critical businesses supporting the blockchain and crypto protocols. In addition, the exchanges, led by the top figures in the industry, house most of the iconic brands in the crypto ecosystem. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash On Downward Motion Since Breaching $105 Level – Here’s Why Since the early days of Bitcoin till now, crypto exchanges have evolved and grown in many ways, gaining users’ trust. However, things have turned sour within the twinkle of an eye, and users have lost faith in crypto exchanges. The FTX collapse has spread its contagion across the crypto space, pulling most crypto exchanges down. Bitcoin Records Highest Exchange Outflow Since 2018 This week recorded a massive outflow of Bitcoin from crypto exchanges after the collapse of FTX. Recent data from Glassnode reveals that Bitcoin flows out of exchanges quickly. According to the report, users and investors have withdrawn all Bitcoins that flowed into exchanges since 2018. Since the FTX insolvency, primarily due to asset mismanagement, the demand for self-custody and spot-driven BTC markets has increased. This action has never been recorded in all previous bear markets that Bitcoin has survived. Bitcoin wasn’t the only asset that recorded massive withdrawals. Stablecoins such as BUSD and USDC also recorded massive outflow from exchanges in the last seven days. On-chain data shows that a large number of the outgoing stablecoins have been moving into self-custody wallets. Santiment’s data confirmed this report. According to Santiment, there was a constant inflow of stablecoins such as USDC, BUSD, and USDT into the crypto market in early 2022. In addition, the data suggested that new investors were buying assets as the prices declined. The stablecoins market cap rose to $134.07 billion, with the inflow of coins at the same time BTC peaked. However, things have changed since the fed’s interest rate hike in June.

Self-Custody Is The Way To Go: Santiment Report Santiment highlighted that the recent crisis teaches everyone to embrace self-custody. The market has learned, reflected in the increased outflow of USDC and BUSD from exchanges. Several crypto firms and investors are facing the heat from the FTX downfall. For example, Crypto venture capital firm Multicoin Capital lost nearly $1 billion in assets held on FTX. The extent of damage in the crypto space and the massive outflow of assets and value declines has left questions on everyone’s minds. Many are wondering if crypto is still alive or dead. There might still be hope since the crypto space has survived similar blows. The Mt.Gox collapse is one event that left a cascade effect on the crypto industry. The Terra collapse also had a similar impact on crypto.

4473644,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509323,1668854136,"This Crypto Venture Capital Loses Almost $1B On FTX, When Will This FTX Fiasco End?","The collapse of the FTX crypto exchange is one of the biggest shocks to hit the industry. The impact of the fall is spreading to different crypto assets and several investors on the exchange. The crypto market has been experiencing massive downward performance as prices of assets kept declining. Hence, the overall value is far below expectations, creating more fears and doubts in crypto. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash On Downward Motion Since Breaching $105 Level – Here’s Why Following the unfolding events and crisis, the CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), filed for bankruptcy for the distressed FTX exchange. He also resigned from his position as CEO. On the part of FTX investors, the story is getting more intense. Several venture investors and individuals have started counting the losses following the bankruptcy filing. Also, the contagion from the collapse of the exchange is still spreading. One such recipient of the negative effect is Multicoin Capital. Multicoin Capital Exposure To FTX Crypto Exchange In the new development, a crypto venture company, Multicoin Capital, has disclosed its exposure to FTX. On Thursday, the firm reported how the fund plummeted by a whopping 55% over last month. It revealed to its investors that the drop in performance was due to the collapse of FTX. The events surrounding FTX gave a huge blow to Multicoin. In July, the firm launched its $430 million fund. As the FTX saga was unwinding last week, the crypto venture firm recovered just one-quarter of its assets from the exchange. But, about 15% of its total assets are still trapped on FTX. Currently, Multicoin Capital plans to write down its assets on the distressed FTX to zero. It noted that it’s the only sensible action to take as the exchange is already immersed in its bankruptcy proceedings. However, it still believed that it would recover some of its assets from the collapsed exchange in the future. At the moment, the crypto venture giant didn’t state the amount it’s writing off regarding the FTX crisis. But some crypto market experts think the value would be more than $850 million. The managing partners of Multicoin, Kyle Samani and Tushar Jain, reacted to the situation in the post. They wrote that they over-trusted their relationship with FTX, which made them lay many assets on the exchange. Multicoin Capital Now Resorts To A Majorly Self-Custodian Before now, Multicoin Capital distributed all its assets across the three leading crypto exchanges; Binance, Coinbase, and FTX. Following the collapse of FTX, the venture firm moved all its remaining assets to either self-custody or Coinbase. Multicoin stated that it currently has no assets exposed to any counterparties. However, it plans to diversify its custodial exposure picking Coinbase as its primary custodian. It noted that it would resume trading with other exchanges once the situation in the market becomes calm.

4473572,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509318,1668854055,"Litecoin (LTC) Up 8% In Last 24 Hours, The Biggest Gainer Out Of Top 20 Cryptos","As the market declined last week (and continues to do so), Litecoin was one of the few currencies to increase in value. CoinGecko reports that the price of a single Litecoin is at $63.69 at the moment. The token is up 8% in the last 24 hours, giving traders and investors some sense of relief. Litecoin (LTC) thus pulled off a surprise, edging out the other cryptos in the top 20 list. The alternative cryptocurrency that has been around for a while appears to be gaining popularity among investors. Only 35% of LTC holders are profitable, per CoinMarketCap. The percentage of holders who would benefit monetarily from a sale at the current time is thus reduced. While this rebound is encouraging, the current state of the market following the contagion that was FTX means that LTC may not be able to avoid more market declines despite the uptick. Related Reading: NEAR Faces Resistance In Attempt To Breach $2 Level As Bears Block Its Way Outlook For Litecoin Looks Favorable As things stand, the market environment is very unfriendly for bulls. Despite the market decline, a few cryptocurrencies have managed to rise into the top 20. The relative strength index (RSI) for LTC is rapidly approaching the oversold zone, indicating a sharp reversal from a bullish to a negative trend. At its present level of $63.69, the price is still above the 38.20 percent Fibonacci retracement zone. Chart: TradingView On a 4-hour timeframe, however, RSI values are increasing, indicating a growing bullish momentum. The current level of support is $61.81, which is a quite significant level of support given the present market conditions. Currently, the market structure resembles a bullish descending triangle, with a likely bullish breakout around the $64.15 price level. In addition to supporting a likely positive breakout, the expanding Bollinger band indicates volatility in the coming weeks. As the bulls retest the $64.15 price resistance in the coming weeks, they should observe the market environment. Long-term LTC investors appear to be selling, while long positions on LTC exceed short positions, according to CoinGlass. With massive short liquidations occurring in LTC over the previous few days, this change in momentum is in stark contrast to present market conditions. What To Anticipate With LTC LTC appears to be moving against the market, diminishing or losing its link with BTC and ETH. As the scenario for Litecoin improves, bulls must be cognizant of the current unfavorable market conditions. Defending the $61.31 support is sufficient to maintain LTC’s bullish momentum if it cannot breach the $64.15 resistance.

According to tracking from Coingecko, the 16th largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization is trading at $0.050 at the time of this writing. For the past seven days, the altcoin has dropped by almost 10% while over the last two weeks its value has declined by 20.2%. On a month-to-date gauge, the digital asset has dumped 17.8% of its spot trading price, painting its entire chart in crimson. However, while TRON remains unsuccessful in initiating a bullish run to reclaim higher trading session prices, its network is performing relatively well as the protocol was able to post impressive numbers last week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash On Downward Motion Since Breaching $105 Level – Here’s Why TRON Network Activity Remains Upbeat Amid FTX Crisis TRON DAO, the official Twitter account of the blockchain network shared some of the highlights of the protocol’s performance for the period of November 7 to November 13. At the conclusion of the specific timeframe, the total number of accounts associated to the blockchain reached 119,949,499 while the overall tally for transactions facilitated over it hit the 4.19 billion mark. TRON’s blockchain height surpassed the 45.83 million and its Total Value Locked (TVL) peaked at $12.3 billion. It is important to note that this impressive growth in both network activity and value happened during the same week when the crypto space was ravaged by the negative effects of the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange platform. Following Binance CEO Changpeng Zao’s decision to back out of initial plans to buy the exchange after the announcement of selling all of its FTT tokens, the crypto market was instantly painted in red as Bitcoin, Etheruem and the rest of the altcoins experienced severe price dumps. TRON Founder Gives His Take On The Future Of NFTs During a recent interview, Justin Sun, the founder of TRON, expressed his ideas about the current situation of the non-fungible token (NFT) industry. According to Sun, sadly, the current generation of NFT tokens doesn’t offer much in terms of utility and that this is something that needs to be addressed if this particular digital asset class hopes to grow exponentially in the near future. He emphasized his point by saying that during this important segment of Web3 development, these customizable tokens will be the focal point of many advancements and projects. For its part, TRON seems to be doing well in this department as its NFT ecosystem also managed to record an uptick in terms of trade count and trade volume.

The FTX fiasco is the theme of the month in the crypto world, and the show’s just beginning. The NYDIG research team avoids the temptation to summarize the whole saga and goes straight to the implications of the fall of Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire. “Some signs of contagion have appeared but a full accounting of the damage and regaining of investor confidence will likely take time,” they say understating the harsh reality. Related Reading: Allied Payment Partners NYDIG, Adds Bitcoin To Corporate Treasury Taking a page from NYDIG’s book, let’s skip the intro and go straight to the conclusions. Contagion Is Around The Corner Speaking about “signs of contagion,” NYDIG mentions BlockFi and the Genesis/ Gemini combo. However, there might be much more to come. “Several other service providers have piqued the curiosity of crypto sleuths as potential next dominoes, but we hesitate to speculate too much without hard evidence. Regardless, industry participants are on edge for even the slightest signs of stress and continue to pull balances off exchanges.” In the contagion section of the paper, we find a rare mention of a conspiracy theory that’s making the rounds in crypto Twitter. Rarely do big players bring this up. “There have been accusations that Alameda caused the initial de-peg of UST, and while that may have been the case, uneconomic rates paid by the Anchor Protocol and insecure economic design of LUNA/UST ensured its ultimate destruction, destroying $60B worth of crypto wealth in a few short days.” Of course, NYDIG ends up doubling down on the thesis about Terra/Luna that they put out in a previous paper titled “On Impossible Things Before Breakfast.” In that paper, NYDIG wrote a great segway to the next section. “DeFi is not decentralized. The Terra ecosystem was not decentralized. Terra initially sourced funding from LUNA token issuance apportioned to Terraform Labs at inception.” FTT price chart on Bitstamp | Source: FTT/USD on TradingView.com NYDIG On DeFi Vs. CeFi Even though they’re clearly not fans of DeFi, NYDIG gives them some credit. “Most DeFi protocols operated as advertised through the volatility this year, minus the ongoing hacks within the ecosystem.” True, but the ongoing hacks are not a minor factor. It’s a billion-dollar problem with no apparent solution available. However, according to NYDIG, this time the problem lies with centralized finance. Those companies “did the rest of the damage” by engaging in these behaviors: “Poor risk controls, conflicts of interest, excessive leverage, unclear accounting, counterparty risks, and poor management were just some of the factors at play. Furthermore, the use of an equity-like token, FTX Token (FTT), as collateral exacerbated the issue.” Is More Regulation The Answer? According to NYDIG, the industry was expecting “improved regulatory clarity for US investors.” However, thanks to the FTX crash and Sam Bankman-Fried’s political lobbying, “the path in DC has grown more complicated. Regulators will now be on their toes and increasingly more likely to use their current authority to enforce existing regulations and possibly issue new ones.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Bracing For A Crypto Winter Bottom Should Check These Data It is what it is, however one has to take into account that “FTX.com wasn’t even a US entity, which raises the question of how impactful improved US regulations would have been, at least with respect to preventing the specific recent events surrounding FTX.” That’s true, but FTX was in business with several US-based fully-regulated entities. If effective, shouldn’t Silvergate’s AML procedures have detected Sam Bankman-Fried’s shenanigans? A related question would be, shouldn’t the due diligence of the highly regarded entities that invested in FTX have detected that something was off?

Interconnected nature created by derivatives and shared holdings continuing to ripple and pressure industry players. Contagion doesn't seem like it's over. Begs question whether or not industry can ever rebound to where it was. Deplorable State of Crypto Anyone who follows the crypto world is familiar with FTX (FTT-USD), its former boss Sam Bankman-Fried, and the demise of his ""empire"". What a lot of crypto-faithful might not be aware of are the knock on effects of FTX's implosion and that of its affiliated investment fund, Alameda Research. Having lived through markets during both the Enron bankruptcy and global financial crisis, I see many similarities to then and now: excessive leverage that was poorly disclosed or not disclosed at all, interrelated entities of questionable utility and ownership, widespread conflicts of interest, and complete lack of reasonable oversight. Those traits resulted in disaster in the past and I suspect now will be no different. The expression, ""There's never just one cockroach"" was apt then and appears apt to describe events subsequent to the FTX meltdown. I expect to see many more crypto-related bankruptcies in fairly short order and more weakness in most cryptocurrencies. The Lenders I think one of the biggest surprises to come out of the FTX debacle is the amount of leverage that was employed. Sam Bankman-Fried has been tweeting aggressively (and probably to great self-hazard) since the bankruptcy and made a stunning confession this week. In a Twitter thread from November 16, he declared that leverage at FTX stood at $5 billion and was supported by $20 billion in assets. We can argue the $20 billion asset value part given the price declines in crypto assets but the $5 billion should have been pretty unquestionable. Somehow it wasn't. Later that same day he tweeted, “I was wrong. Leverage wasn’t ~$5b, it was ~$13b. $13b leverage, total run on the bank, total collapse in asset value, all at once. Which is why you don't want that leverage.” Uh, really, Sam? You didn't know that you had $13 billion instead of $5 billion? $8 billion of debt just magically appeared? It's hard to think of any CEO (or anyone for that matter), who could be that clueless. I am of the opinion that Bankman-Fried is likely more aware than that. However, his organization was clearly a mess. John Ray III, who replaced SBF, wrote a scathing letter about the state of the firm in which he crushed former management, saying: ""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls."" and ""From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented."" In case anyone wants to question Ray's credentials, he led the Enron bankruptcy restructuring. More and more details keep emerging as Ray's picks through the mess he stepped into and none of them are constructive. As was the case in both Enron and the global financial crisis, there are knock on effects from such a large player going down with so much leverage in a world where derivatives create labyrinthine interconnections. The effects in this case are starting to take down other players. Crypto lender BlockFi is rumored to be planning a bankruptcy. FTX provided BlockFi with a $400 million credit line and BlockFi in turn lent money to Alameda Research, SBF's hedge fund, which also received funds from FTX. Genesis Global Capital, the lending arm of Genesis Global Trading, which like Grayscale ( GBTC ) is owned by Digital Currrency Group is pausing new loans and redemptions. This suspension is apparently affecting accounts at Gemini, the crypto exchange owned by the Winklevoss twins . Gemini had a program called ""Gemini Earn"", where customers could earn high interest rates on the digital currency assets. The company tweeted, ""We are aware that Genesis Global Capital, LLC (Genesis) — the lending partner of the Earn program — has paused withdrawals and will not be able to meet customer redemptions within the service-level agreement of 5 business days."" Questions are now emerging surrounding about deposit volume at Silvergate Capital ( SI ), whose stock has fallen dramatically this week. SI had no loans out to FTX or Alameda, only deposits. Still, it does make loans collateralized by Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), which could become a problem. Coinbase ( COIN ) is falling too, less for concerns around exposure to margin lending and more to declining value of trading volume thanks to declining crypto values. Possible Implications I published a write up on Microstrategy ( MSTR ) earlier this week. MSTR is another massively leveraged player in the crypto space albeit simpler than FTX, BlockFi, Genesis or Gemini. It simply owns 130,000 Bitcoin that is underwater versus the leverage it used to purchase it all. Despite this in my opinion reckless speculation on Bitcoin, plenty of Michael Saylor defenders commented on that article. Most of the defense centers around belief in a potential recovery in the price of Bitcoin. Reasons stated for why it will recover are flimsy at best. That leads me back to my central view on cryptocurrencies. Given the price declines that just about every cryptocurrency had experienced this year, I think it's safe to say that cryptocurrencies are not : a store of value. What store of value drops 75-99%? a replacement for fiat currencies. The volatility is too high to be legal tender. an inflation hedge. They were tested this year and failed. If cryptocurrencies are not any of the above, what are they? Judging by the hanky panky (putting it lightly) that occurred at places like FTX, cryptocurrencies are just examples (if perhaps the most egregious) of the rampant speculation caused by super loose monetary and fiscal policies. Such an environment bred an investment style where fundamental, intrinsic value of assets did not matter as much as momentum if at all. People bought things simply because they went up. Fear of missing out replaced risk of capital impairment. Crypto is the epitome of this risk-taking dynamic. Fed Governor Neel Kashkari tweeted today ""The entire notion of crypto is nonsense. Not useful 4 payments. No inflation hedge. No scarcity. No taxing authority. Just a tool of speculation & greater fools."" Well said. With the end of easy money came the end of this type of speculation. Conclusion My two favorite quotes by Warren Buffett are: ""Rule number one is don't lose money. Rule number two is don't forget rule number one."" and ""When the tide goes out, you see who is swimming naked."" I think it's pretty clear that a lot of people like were skinny dipping and many crypto-faithful who hung on his every word forgot rule number one. Investing is hard. There can be a lot of pitfalls. One can lose money even in situations that look pretty safe. Speculation in highly volatile assets is just a bad idea, full stop. Employing leverage in it is a recipe for disaster for both the investor and potentially the lender (as we are seeing with FTX, BlockFi, etc.). I fully expect crypto true believers to disagree with this piece or claim I don't understand the asset class. My only response will be, please tell me the intrinsic value of this stuff.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4559186-crypto-winter-whiffs-of-enron-and-housing-meltdown?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4451577.jpeg
