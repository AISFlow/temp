The new platform seeks to ""make the trading experience easier and more intuitive,"" according to the startup. Other features include a new chart system which provides streamlined access to historical data and a consolidated portfolio view.  Beyond simply trading assets, Coinbase Pro aims to provide a host of new features for investors, according to the release, which reads:  ""Our vision is to give customers the ability to participate in services like staking and protocol voting that are distinct to crypto. As the decentralized ecosystem advances, we expect there will be many more opportunities for customers to interact with digital assets in new and unique ways.""  As part of this effort to let customers use digital assets, Coinbase Pro will integrate Paradex support over the next few weeks, which will enable users to ""trade hundreds of tokens directly from their wallets,"" according to the release.  ""Initially, this experience is for our customers outside the U.S. but will be available to U.S. customers as soon as we obtain regulatory clearance, which we're actively working toward,"" the company said.  Paradex enables investors to trade ERC-20 tokens directly from their digital token wallets, by acting as a relay for transfers. Hardware wallets - notably the Ledger wallet - are supported as well.  In order to transfer ethereum tokens, the system requires users to turn them into ""wrapped ether,"" which is described as ""a tradeable version of regular ether."" Users can also transfer other tokens after connecting the Paradex app to their wallet, according to the site.  While Paradex allows users to trade ERC-20 coins held in their wallets, it remains unclear if Coinbase will add direct purchase or trading support for such tokens. In March, the company announced it was adding support for the ERC-20 technical standard, but did not reveal any specific products at the time.

Looking into the possibility, a working group at Norges Bank has released a report titled ""Central Bank Digital Currencies,"" which explains that, as citizens turn away from physical forms of money, the bank must consider ""a number of new attributes that are important for ensuring an efficient and robust payment system.""  Already, the country's DNB bank has stopped handling cash, with Trond Bentestuen, group executive vice president of wealth management and insurance at the bank, telling local media as far back as 2016, that only 6 percent of Norwegians use cash on a daily basis.  Further, Jon Nicolaisen, deputy governor of Norges Bank, stated in a speech last April that the role of cash “continues to diminish” as consumers move towards electronic payments, adding that ""For many consumers, electronic central bank money could provide an alternative to deposit money in a bank, as cash does today.""  The new report looks at various features and purposes for a CBDC and suggests some roles that ""merit further consideration,"" including as an alternative to deposits in private banks (in addition to cash); as a back-up solution for the standard electronic payment systems; and to provide a suitable legal tender as a supplement to cash.  Describing blockchain-based systems as ""immature,"" the report further explains that the preferred model for the CBDC would be either ""account-based"" – centralized and stored on a database – or ""value-based"" – decentralized and stored on electronic chips such as prepaid cards or SIMs.  However, the authors continue:  ""A CBDC raises complex issues. There is virtually no international experience to draw on. Further analysis is needed to assess the purposes of a CBDC, the types of solutions that best achieve these purposes and the benefits measured against financial and other costs.""  The authors conclude that it is ""too early"" to conclude whether Norges Bank should take the lead and introduce a central bank digital currency. At the same time, the working group did not identify problems that would rule out the idea.

According to a report by the Philippine Information Agency on Wednesday, the initiative – dubbed Project i2i – is led by the Union Bank of the Philippines, one of the country's largest banking institutions, and will use the Kaleido blockchain platform developed by the ethereum startup ConsenSys.  The project was first revealed by Justo Ortiz, chairman of UnionBank, on May 15 at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference in New York, and seeks to integrate rural banks with the country's major financial networks through a blockchain-powered retail payment platform.  Currently the project is being formally rolled out with seven rural banks, including Cantilan, one of the Philippine's largest community banks.  Today's report indicates that financial services such as interbank transactions in rural parts of the country – which is comprised of more than 7,000 islands – are still largely manually processed and paper-based because integration with the country's clearing house and the SWIFT network is ""too complex.""  Tanya Hotchkiss, executive vice president of Cantilan, was quoted as saying that a normal interbank transaction could take up to a month to arrive, since there are 25 procedures being handled manually.  The banks' blockchain exploration comes soon after a similar group effort led by Union Bank, which partnered with five Philippines rural banks to utiize credit card giant Visa's blockchain-based payment system to boost the efficiency of their transaction processes.

42380699,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8z5w7,1527078643,Experimental Voting Effort Aims to Break Ethereum Governance Gridlock,"When people think of ethereum, they generally think also of the protocol's developer Vitalik Buterin, now – off his creation – a multi-millionaire.  No doubt, Buterin is a leader of sorts for the community, even if decision-making is somewhat decentralized. And above that, ethereum's most active developers have a significant amount of say in the direction of the technology.  Recently, however, the protocol's decision-making has been called into question as a series of controversial proposals have arisen – be it the development of new forms of mining hardware or the recovery of lost funds due to various vulnerabilities.  As the community debates the various pros and cons of such proposals, Buterin has begun working with economics researcher Dr. Glen Weyl to experiment with the idea of enabling a new kind of voting for the ethereum users. In a blog post announcing the collaboration on May 21, Buterin described how ideas from Weyl's recent book, ""Radical Markets,"" could help address these governance challenges and coordinate solutions for contentious issues.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Weyl, who received a Ph.D. in economics at Princeton University and is now a researcher at Microsoft, explained that quadratic voting aims to focus voters on issues they are passionate about and educated on. Rather than votes being distributed equally across participants, users can purchase extra votes to have a greater say in certain issues.  ""The idea is it allows people to express how important things are to them, and not just which direction they feel about it,"" Weyl said.  The collaboration comes at a time when other ethereum researchers have banded together in an effort to come up with ways to better measure community sentiment.  And although Buterin wasn't directly involved in those meetings, in the blog post, he noted his belief that existing proposals for decentralized decision-making either put too much authority into the hands of those who own ether or, in trying to reach a larger pool of stakeholders, are vulnerable to attack by fake accounts and malicious actors trying to sway the vote.  As such, Buterin and Weyl write, the quadratic voting proposal is a more ""moderate alternative"" to other forms of decentralized governance.  Weyl told CoinDesk:  ""[Quadratic voting] allows for decisions to be made for the greatest number of people.""  Connecting communities  The duo's post on the matter seems aligned with an announcement made earlier this month by Virgil Griffith from the Ethereum Foundation, the not-for-profit that funds ethereum-related research, that it was seeking applications for projects wanting to test experiments based on Weyl's theories.  Prior to fully fledged announcements, however, Buterin and Weyl's blog post hints at ways the method could occur.  ""Citizens can use a (possibly artificial) currency to buy votes at the cost of the square of the votes bought on the issues that are most important to them,"" the blog post states.  Weyl echoed this in conversation to CoinDesk, saying, ""We would like to make a voting system where people make trades, so I give up the things that are less important to me and you give up the things that are less important to you, we all are happier.""  In an effort to block a small number of the financially elite to buy up a large portion of votes and in turn disproportionately affect outcomes, the system would make the price per 1,000 votes, 1,000,000 credits, which should prevent that from happening.  Elaborating on the concept, Weyl explained that it's part of an overall attempt to implement economic theory into technological systems.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Even if exact solutions don't turn out the way we want, the mechanism design community has such a natural synergy with the blockchain community [that] we can build a real collaboration between those.""  While Weyl won't be involved in the technicalities of building the model for ethereum, he does believe this is the first step towards a deeper collaboration between his and Buterin's respective communities.  'A perfect balance'  It's maybe surprising that these two communities haven't directly overlapped previously since both emphasize cooperation, equality and decentralization in their visions for the future.  ""Our ultimate goal is to shape a society that would work differently,"" Weyl said.  However, Weyl said that blockchain projects current governance structures aren't living up to their values.  Lacking a more formal governance method, the ethereum community specifically has struggled to reach consensus on key topics throughout the years – one such debate over The DAO hack even leading a dissenting minority to split off the main chain and create ethereum classic. While on-chain governance exists to some extent – and other methods are being tested on other protocols, such as Gavin Wo0d's Polkadot – some believe that these methods lack the fairness necessary for public blockchains.  But the communities are stuck at a crossroads. For one, more traditional voting structures whereby every person gets a single vote don't take into account that some people have a bigger stake in the system.  But on the other hand, if the system were to reward one vote per coin a user holds, many worry the same issues seen today in the broader world – whereby the rich have significantly more power than the poor – would be recreated.  ""What quadratic voting allows you to do is to strike a perfect balance between the two ideas,"" Weyl said, adding:  ""It matches pretty perfectly to the desires of the system to on the one hand to have an egalitarian flavor but also to acknowledge that people are committed to different degrees.""  Identity is key  That said, there are technical issues that would need to be resolved before such a system could be viable.  For instance, Weyl said that quadratic voting can only work if voters are pegged to identities, otherwise, it is as liable to manipulation. Indeed, if one user was able to sell their votes through separate accounts, they could exploit the system.  ""I am hopeful that blockchain will not be an identity-free zone because if it is, it will be a plutocratic zone, and that does not accord with ideas people of the space have,"" Weyl said.  But Weyl isn't particularly worried about this since restructuring identity online has been a hot topic both inside and outside the blockchain space for some time.  Overall, though, in spite of whether a quadratic voting system gets instituted into ethereum, Weyl hopes that going forward, the blockchain will provide a ""critical testing ground"" in order to scrutinize the effectivity of quadratic voting, potentially to scale it up to bigger political systems.  Weyl concluded:  ""We're really trying to create a bridge between radical mechanism design and community on the one hand and the ethereum community on the other.""

According to Bloomberg, people close to the matter said that the government might levy GST of 18 percent on digital currency trades, despite the Reserve Bank of India's recent ban restricting banks from dealing with cryptocurrencies or trading platforms.  The anonymous sources said that the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Custom is currently considering the proposal, which will also be put before the Goods and Service Tax Council once it is finalized.  The proposal outlines that purchases and sales of cryptocurrencies are subject to taxes, as they are considered a supply of goods, the report suggests.  The value of a cryptocurrency transaction would be based on the value in rupees or the equivalent in freely convertible foreign currency. Transactions involving parties outside India would be liable for integrated GST (IGST), and would be considered an import or export of goods.  Meanwhile, cryptocurrency transactions made for reasons such as ""supply, transfer, storage and accounting"" would be considered services, as would crypto mining, Bloomberg says. However, cryptocurrency exchanges would have to pay GST on commission under the proposal, while foreign exchanges would be liable for IGST.  The sources further said that, although no decision has been made so far, the government could levy the new tax regime as soon as July 1. It may, though, have to wait as the government decides if and how to regulate the technology.  India's tax department has in recent months been cracking down on tax avoidance by crypto traders. It issued notices to around 100,000 traders and investors in February after surveys of exchanges found that $3.5 billion in cryptocurrency transactions may have been performed by citizens over the previous 17 months.

According to a news release issued by the Supreme People's Procuratorate issued Wednesday, a local prosecutor's office in Hunan province has charged the four individuals as part of a wider crackdown on ""Weika Coin"" – the Chinese name for OneCoin, a purported crypto investment scheme that has seen global law enforcement agencies launch investigations and issue warnings and fines.  The report indicates that the legal process launched in September 2017 and has been conducted in three phases that have seen 98 people prosecuted for allegedly deceiving investors across over 20 provinces in China. A number of those have already been sentenced with up to four years in prison and/or fines ranging from 10,000–5 million yuan ($1,565–$783,000).  The prosecutor said that the scheme involved up to 2 million victims, while the amount of capital received from investors totals as much as 15 billion yuan (around $2 billion). Nearly 1.7 billion yuan ($266 million) has been recovered, the report states.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the OneCoin scheme, which was founded by an individual called Ruja Ignatova, has been scrutinized by police in a number of countries over suspicions that it is fraudulent.  Promoters in Italy have been fined millions of euros, while authorities in India also moved to arrest suspects associated with OneCoin in April of last year and subsequently brought charges against Ignatova in July.

42380705,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8z5zt,1527066017,Bitcoin Price Faces Bear Indicator Not Seen Since 2014,"Following bitcoin's recent losses, a key long-term trend indicator is looking increasingly bearish.  Notably, the five-month moving average (MA) has rolled over in favor of the bears and looks set to cut the 10-month MA from above – a bearish crossover that hasn't been seen since June 2014.  If that occurs it could be a worrying signal for the long-term price outlook. Back then, following an identical crossover in June 2014, the cryptocurrency subsequently dropped by 70 percent (from $580 to $166) in the seven months leading up to January 2015.  This time around, the bearish crossover will likely occur at the turn of the month, if bitcoin extends the current decline towards the $7,000 mark, and would open the doors for a deeper sell-off towards the $5,000 mark.  Monthly chart  Currently, the five-month MA is seen at $8,916 and the 10-month MA is located at $8,379, according to Bitfinex data. Meanwhile, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,820 – down almost 5 percent in the last 24 hours.  Daily chart  The observed lower-highs and lower-lows pattern (marked by circles) and the downward sloping 5-day and 10-day MAs indicate a bearish setup. The chart also shows a bearish crossover between the 10-day and 50-day MAs.  Further, the relative strength index (RSI) is below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), but holding well above 30.00 (oversold territory), indicating enough room for a sell-off towards $7,000.  Weekly chart  Acceptance below the 50-week MA, currently seen at $7,620, would only bolster the already bearish daily chart technicals and increase the odds of the bearish five-month/10-month MA crossover.  The 50-week MA worked as a strong support in April, so a break below that level could yield a sharp sell-off.  View  BTC risks deeper pullback towards $7,000. In such a case, the 5-month MA will cross the 10-month MA from above, signaling a bearish crossover and opening doors for a drop to $5,000.  Bullish scenario: A solid rebound from the 50-week MA at $7,620 and a convincing break above $8,644 would signal a bullish reversal.

According to a consultation paper published on Tuesday, MAS states that the current single-tier ""recognized market operators"" (RMO) regulatory framework is not able to meet demand for new business models based on such emerging technologies. To address the issue, the authority proposes to introduce a three-tier structure in an attempt to ease market access for small-scale exchange platforms.  ""MAS has observed the emergence of new business models in trading platforms, including trading facilities that make use of blockchain technology, or platforms that allow peer-to-peer trading without the involvement of intermediaries,"" the MAS writes in the paper, adding:  ""As the current RMO regime has been in place since 2002, it is timely to review to the regulatory framework for market operators to ensure that it continues to meet the demands of the changing landscape.""  In particular, tier 3 of the proposed framework applies to market operators that are significantly smaller than established exchanges and is intended allow them to implement blockchain and P2P technology and roll out services in a supervised environment.  ""This new tier is designed to facilitate new entrants that develop solutions for wholesale market participants, or market operators that have reached the end of their sandbox tenure and are commercially viable, but whose businesses are not able to meet the requirements of the existing RMO regime,"" MAS explained.  Currently, the authority supervises the exchange market under two categories: approved exchanges (AE) and the recognized market operators (RMOs). The former applies to ""systemically-important"" platforms that are available to retail investors such as Singapore's stock exchange.  The RMO framework, on the other hand, allows regulation of other exchanges such as those for commodities and derivatives trading, which would fall under the new proposal's tier 2, if the proposal is enacted.  Interested parties such as financial institutions now have until June 22 to provide MAS with feedback on the proposal.

Monero project lead Riccardo Spagni, more commonly known as fluffypony, and entrepreneur Dan Teree are also part of the founding team, Jain told CoinDesk.  Tari's goal is to ""support any kind of digital assets."" For example, one use case for the protocol would be to allow digital asset issuers to participate in the secondary market - meaning resales in particular.  However, the protocol can also support items in video games or even native assets, Jain said, adding:  ""If you have a decentralized distributed trustless system that supports non-fungible tokens that enforces the rule sets around digital assets, that changes the game because now you have an opportunity for consumers to trade those digital assets.""  Jain said he believes Tari's approach to digital assets is unique for a variety of reasons, noting that ""we don't want to make a lot of future statements, we just want to prove ourselves along the way and we think that's a great way to build trust and build our community.""  He continued, saying ""I think what sets our token apart is we're maniacally focused on our use case. This isn't an ethereum competitor.""  More broadly, he believes protocols and networks looking at specific use cases may be more useful than general-purpose ones.  ""I think an important point to make in terms of how our space is evolving too -do we build a protocol that's useful for every possible use case or do we build one that's focused on one type of use case,"" Jain concluded.

Modeled within the school's Digital Currency Initiative, started in 2015 as a way to further R&D on cryptocurrencies, the test envisions a system wherein transactions would take place automatically in the case of defined external events, based on say today's weather or the current price of U.S. dollars.  This is possible due to MIT's creative use of so-called ""oracles,"" trusted entities meant to broadcast data to smart contracts. For this demo, researchers Tadge Dryja and Alin S. Dragos built a test oracle to broadcast the recent price of U.S. dollars in satoshis, the smallest unit of bitcoins, which anyone can grab and use for their smart contracts.  It's a notable step forward for the idea, one first proposed by lightning inventor Dryja last summer. However, this is the first time it's been implemented as a prototype with working code.  Dragos told CoinDesk:  ""We built this as a standalone feature of our lightning network software. We chose data what we thought would be cool, U.S. dollars, but it could be any data you want, whether weather or a stock.""  Dragos stressed that the demo is ""experimental"" and ""shouldn't be used for real money."" That said, he and other MIT researchers are convinced that with the help of the lightning network, bitcoin might one day scale to capacities originally envisioned by its early users.  As part of that work, MIT researchers have already created an implementation for the lightning network called lit, and this oracle code is an add-on of that work.  ""We at DCI, we really believe in the lightning network,"" Dragos said. ""Bitcoin doesn't scale very well. I decided there has to be something better. Turns out what's better is lightning. It's the way to scale.""  Bitcoin smart contracts  But while lightning provides scale, smart contracts add other new functionality to bitcoin. For example, should the tech in MIT's test be implemented, you could make some sort of a bet based on what's happening in the world.  Or, in this case, a futures contract. Alice promises to pay Bob whatever the price of dollars is in satoshis on a certain day, say Friday. If a dollar is worth 12,150 satoshis by the end of the week, then she will end up paying that.  It's a kind of advanced smart contract use case that is usually not associated with bitcoin.  ""When folks think smart contracts, they think ethereum. Their scripting language is much richer,"" Dragos admitted.  But, he argues that with some workarounds, bitcoin can do the same thing.  ""It's not as developer friendly because bitcoin didn't go in that direction, but you can use it. You have to be a little creative,"" Dragos said.  In short, it uses Dryja's ""discreet log contracts"" scheme to broadcast data to the smart contracts. One of the most important advantages of this scheme is scalability, because most of the data doesn't need to be stored on the bitcoin blockchain.  The other is privacy, since oracles don't have any way of knowing who's using the data they're broadcasting.  ""We're introducing a model where oracles are not aware of who's using the data they're using,"" Dragos said.  Some 'quandaries'  But while this simple demo is now complete, Dragos and Dryja think there are many outstanding questions and ""quandaries,"" as Dragos put it. ""From the individual oracle's perspective, they're going to want to make some money. We're going to have to understand that,"" Dragos said.  Another is that the oracle at this point is trusted. But there might be a way to minimize this trust by allowing a user to use many oracles at once.  But there's a certain point where MIT DCI hopes to stop working on the technology and pass it off to someone else.  ""We're working with companies that might implement this,"" Dragos said. And though he couldn't name names, he mentioned they are ""big company"" partners of the DCI.  The hope is these bigger companies will be better at understanding what normal users want from the software. So, while MIT DCI built a prototype demonstrating how the underlying technology really works, they haven't produced an app as mindlessly easy to use as say, Venmo or Facebook.  ""UX is not our core expertise,"" Dragos said.  Now it's open for people to use for whatever oracle data they want. So, it's up to the community to decide if it's worthwhile to use or not.  ""It's a hard guess. It could be a significant deal if people use it. But we don't know what people are going to be using it for,"" he added.  Dragos stated:  ""New technologies are available all the time, that doesn't mean they end up making it though.""
