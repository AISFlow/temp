Crypto analyst Ali highlights a critical resistance zone on DOGE‚Äôs chart. Despite the asset‚Äô currently facing a price decline, Ali noted that should the Dogecoin price break above this key resistance, we could see a massive rally for the memecoin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls On The Rise: Analyst Highlight Path To $0.2 DOGE‚Äôs Decisive Battle: Overcoming Critical Resistance for Potential Price Surge In a post published on May 28, Ali highlighted a critical resistance zone between $0.166 and $0.171, notably bolstered by the collective holdings of approximately 10 billion DOGE held by 75,500 addresses. This significant aggregation of Dogecoin at these specific price points forms a strong barrier, complicating the asset‚Äôs ability to surge in value. Ali posits that if Dogecoin can effectively surpass this resistance, it may trigger a substantial price surge. Breaking through this level could lead to doubling its current price, setting the stage for an assault on the next major resistance mark at $0.322. #Dogecoin is encountering significant resistance between $0.166 and $0.171, where 75,500 addresses have acquired nearly 10 billion $DOGE.

The importance of this resistance zone is further magnified by current market conditions, where Dogecoin has experienced a correction, decreasing by 4.9% in the past 24 hours and settling at a trading price of $1.633. This downturn is part of a broader altcoin retreat. Dogecoin‚Äôs open interest declined by 8.26% over the past day, although its open interest volume surged nearly 20% in the same period. Other Predictions And Market Sentiment Around Dogecoin Despite the immediate challenges, some analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin. Mags, a noted crypto analyst, has recently predicted a potential 700% increase in Dogecoin‚Äôs price, propelling it above the $1 mark.

The approval comes after apparent political pressure from above. Should you start investing in Ethereum ETFs? Despite the newfound freedom to do so, I'd argue no. Investors should learn to walk before they run in the crypto markets, and learn how they're leaving money on the table in the mainstream financial system before going all-in on crypto. In a surprise move last week, the SEC signed off on exchange proposals to list Ethereum-based ETFs. This means that Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) will soon be tradable for millions of investors in their brokerage accounts with just a few clicks. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs ( BTC-USD ) in January was a watershed moment for crypto , and Ethereum ETFs were a logical next step. Even earlier this month, the idea of an Ethereum ETF had seemed like a longshot. But Donald Trump stepped up attacks on the SEC in early May and began accepting crypto donations , leading prominent Democrats to fear that crypto was becoming a political weakness . It seems that some political pressure may have been applied, and Ethereum soared on the approval news. Data by YCharts I'm a proponent of Bitcoin for its role as a decentralized currency that can't be inflated away by central banks. However, there are 10,000+ other cryptocurrencies out there. I would argue that more than 99% of them are fundamentally worthless. It's not clear whether the SEC will start allowing random altcoin cryptos to list on US exchanges‚Äì this seems like it would create way too much potential for all kinds of shenanigans. But Ethereum has over $400 billion in market cap and has been around for 10+ years, so allowing the ETF to move forward seems like a reasonable compromise between protecting investors and allowing degrees of freedom with where people put their money. This said‚Äìkey differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum make me skeptical about the utility of investing in Ethereum, especially via ETF. ETF Conversion Will End Crypto Funds' Premium/Discount Insanity If you'd had perfect foresight about the Ethereum ETF being allowed, you could have made a boatload buying the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( OTCQX:ETHE ). The discount to ETHE's net asset value steadily shrank over the last year from 50%-plus to near 0% as of today. Data by YCharts A longer-term view shows the insanity of the ETHE fund and how it traded at a massive premium, then a huge discount. For retail investors who don't understand how NAV works, this is a way to lose tons of money. Data by YCharts Here we see that the fund traded for as much as an 800% premium to the value of its underlying Ethereum during COVID. I knew a few retail investors who insisted on buying this fund because it was ""ethereum"" and paid 2x or more the value of the underlying Ethereum, only to sell for less than the value of their Ethereum during the crypto bust in 2022. This caused massive losses. Data by YCharts Here's another way to look at it‚Äì ETHE generally traded for huge premiums to the value of its underlying assets until 2021, then huge discounts in 2022 and 2023. In general, if you're going to buy closed-end funds, you need to be aware of the net asset value of the assets you're buying. Failure to do so can create ugly losses, and recognizing when assets are trading below NAV with a catalyst to move it back to NAV can make for great trades. To this point, you can look at Grayscale's remaining crypto funds and compare NAV to market price. What you'll find is that there is little to no correlation between asset value and what people are paying. For example, Grayscale's Litecoin Trust ( OTCQX:LTCN ) trades for roughly $29, but the underlying crypto is only worth $7. Don't pay $29 when you can pay $7 on the open market! Grayscale still does have a couple of funds trading well below NAV. The two funds under NAV are Grayscale's Digital Large Cap Fund ( OTCQX:GDLC ) and the Ethereum Classic Trust ( OTC:ETCG ), but you'd have to do some due diligence to find catalysts. If there's no catalyst you get stuck paying 2.5% in fees for life. If you have an opinion on these, share your thoughts in the comments! But most of these funds are trading well over NAV, which means you shouldn't touch them with a ten-foot pole. It's not clear whether the SEC will approve any more crypto ETFs after Ethereum, so my guess is that these trades are over. Money Is Inside Baseball: Crawl Before You Walk If you can't spot who the sucker at the poker table is, the sucker is you. The same is true for crypto. I just showed you how crypto funds trade at huge premiums and discounts to NAV, and how people willingly paid huge NAV premiums for crypto funds only to get burned. This is also true for crypto itself. Financial returns for people I know who are involved in Ethereum are in large part due to staking/farming/lending. If you aren't participating in this, you seem to be losing purchasing power to those who are. If you're doing staking/lending wrong, you also risk losing your money to scams and counterparty risk. The Ethereum ETFs won't be allowed to do staking, per the SEC rules. I mean, would you invest in a US dollar ETF that didn't pay interest? One similarity between the mainstream financial system and the crypto world is that it transfers wealth from people who don't know what's going on to people who do. For example, in the US, money market funds currently hold about $6.4 trillion in assets, while commercial banks hold $17.6 trillion. If consumers ever really caught on to using money market funds, it would be a serious issue for banks because they could cut out the invisible middleman en masse. Fortunately for banks, 90% of people are unaware or are too lazy to care. Bank of America ( BAC ) alone holds close to $1 trillion in consumer deposits and pays an average of 0.55% per year on them. This is something I see all the time. People will be making $80,000 per year and complain they have no money left over, but they have a $1,000 per month car payment, are paying for debit cards with everything and not getting any cash back, and then they have their money parked where it's earning 0.05% APR. The problem isn't the system, it's them. For investors in crypto, these tendencies are only magnified. While I'm sure there are good staking opportunities out there using Ethereum, they require a high level of sophistication and the new ETFs won't be able to get involved. Bottom Line My question for investors in crypto is‚Äì if the public understands the US banking system so poorly, do they have any business investing in crypto funds? Beyond some Bitcoin, probably not. I think putting some money in the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) or the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ) is reasonable. However, people seem to get very quickly out over their skis in crypto, so unless you have a good idea of what the underlying mechanics are in Ethereum and other crypto markets, I think it's best to stay clear.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4696099-the-sec-is-allowing-ethereum-etfs-should-you-invest?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28600487.jpeg

28599899,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610233,1716933637,Ethereum Spot ETFs: Report Shows Grayscale Could Keep ETH Price Down With $110M Daily Outflows,"A recent market report by research firm Kaiko noted how Grayscale‚Äôs Spot Ethereum ETF could have a negative impact on Ethereum‚Äôs (ETH) price. This is based on the firm‚Äôs expectations that Grayscale‚Äôs Ethereum Trust (ETHE) could follow a similar path to Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Ethereum Could Face Significant Selling Pressure From Grayscale‚Äôs Outflows Kaiko noted that Ethereum could face significant selling pressure from Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE once the Spot Ethereum ETFs begin trading. This is because the fund has been trading at a discount between 6% and 26% over the past three months, with a wave of profit-taking likely to concur. It is worth mentioning that Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE has previously operated as a closed-end fund, with Grayscale simply applying to convert it to an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Will Crash 80% To $0.10, What‚Äôs The Trigger? The research firm noted that Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE has over $11 billion in assets under management (AuM). That means that $110 million of daily average outflows could leave the fund if Grayscale‚Äôs Ethereum ETF sees a similar magnitude of outflows to Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF, whose $6.5 billion outflows in the first month of trading amounted to 23% of the fund‚Äôs AuM. Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) also operated in a similar fashion before it was converted to an ETF. This is believed to have contributed to the $6.5 billion outflows the fund recorded in the first month of trading, with many investors taking profit since they purchased the fund at a discount. Therefore, Kaiko expects that something similar could happen with Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE. The outflows that Grayscale‚Äôs Spot Bitcoin ETF is known to have exerted significant selling pressure on Bitcoin‚Äôs price, causing the flagship crypto to decline significantly. As such, the same thing can be expected with Ethereum‚Äôs price if Grayscale‚Äôs Spot Ethereum ETF suffers a similar fate. However, besides investors taking profit from Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF, Grayscale‚Äôs fund fee is believed to be another factor that sparked the significant outflows it recorded back then. For context, Grayscale‚Äôs fee was the highest among all the Bitcoin ETF issuers. As such, the potential outflows from Grayscale‚Äôs Ethereum ETF could be minimally reduced if the asset manager makes it fee competitive this time around. Ethereum‚Äôs Future Trajectory Still Bullish Kaiko suggested that Ethereum is still bound to make significant price gains once other Ethereum Spot ETFs begin to record impressive inflows that can overshadow the outflows from Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE. Something similar happened with Bitcoin, as Kaiko noted that Grayscale GBTC‚Äôs outflows were offset and surpassed by inflows from other Bitcoin ETFs by the end of January. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 28,900% Rally To $154 For XRP Price, Here‚Äôs When Thanks to the impressive demand that these Bitcoin ETFs recorded, the flagship crypto hit a new all-time high (ATH) in March earlier this year. The Ethereum ETFs could also trigger such a rally for ETH‚Äôs price depending on the amount of inflows these funds record once they begin trading. Meanwhile, Kaiko noted that even if the inflows disappoint in the short term, the mere approval of these funds already has ‚Äúimportant implications for ETH as an asset‚Äù since it confirms that it isn‚Äôt a security. This has helped remove the regulatory uncertainty that has weighed on Ethereum‚Äôs price for some time now.

Gox Sells","Bitcoin briefly shot over $70,000 yesterday before plunging below $69,000 to spot rates. While there are hints of weakness, one analyst on X notes that inflow to exchanges like Binance and OKX is subdued, meaning that users are not keen to sell despite prices tanking and failing to break $72,000. Bitcoin Inflow To Exchanges Remain Low The analyst notes that exchange inflows are low at spot rates. As of May 28, exchanges received just 25.9K BTC daily. From historical exchange inflow data from CryptoQuant, the current inflow rate is at the 2016 level. There was a sharp pick-up in momentum after 2016, but the inflow to exchanges has been shrinking since the beginning of the year. It should be noted that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved nine spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) around this time. Related Reading: Bullish Bitcoin: Expert Cites $123,832 Target Based On Past Trends With this product in the United States, some large whales likely decided to convert their coins and hold ETFs instead. In this way, they diverted custody to an approved custodian, depending on the spot Bitcoin ETF issuer they chose. Mt. Gox Moving BTC: How Will Prices React If They Sell? While the average inflow to exchanges is at 2016 levels, there might be changes in the coming months. On May 28, Mt. Gox, the defunct crypto exchange hacked in 2014, moved over $9.4 billion of BTC, data from Token Unlocks show. This unexpected transfer sparked market concerns. Currently, the intention remains unknown. Still, the implications could be dire if they decide to liquidate on exchanges. Even with this possibility, the analyst argued that BTC‚Äôs low average exchange inflow to exchanges would be a timely cushion. Should Mt.Gox creditors decide to sell, the analyst believes the market will easily absorb this sell-off despite increased initial volatility. What this means is that the price impact will be minimal.

Current trading prices are around $18.09. This uptrend coincides with a general bullish sentiment across the altcoin market, highlighted by the overall market cap for altcoins increasing from $930 billion earlier in the month to $1.156 trillion. This positive trend in the altcoin market is further exemplified by the major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, BNB, and XRP, which, despite minor retracements, continue to show strong market potential. For instance, while these top altcoins have seen slight declines in the past 24 hours, Solana has experienced a 2.7% increase, which could indicate selective investor confidence in specific altcoins.

28593627,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610232,1716922835,"Market Expert Says XRP Price Reaching $1,000 Is Inevitable, Here‚Äôs Why","Despite its unimpressive price action, crypto analysts have maintained faith in the XRP price, offering bullish price predictions for the crypto token. This time, crypto analyst BarriC has predicted that XRP‚Äôs price reaching four figures will undoubtedly happen. XRP Price Will Reach $1,000 At Some Point BarriC explained in an X (formerly Twitter) post why he believes XRP will eventually reach $1,000. He mentioned that no one could have envisaged that Bitcoin would hit $73,000 when it was still trading at $330 in 2016. He also made reference to other crypto tokens like Ethereum, Litecoin, Solana, and Dogecoin, which were trading really low at some point and went on to make significant price gains. Related Reading: Dogecoin Poised For 700% Explosion To $1.17 Amid Recovery In Major Metrics Therefore, he believes a similar pattern could play out with XRP. He noted that XRP was trading way lower than its current price level at some point when it was $0.006 in 2017, and no one imagined it would climb to an all-time high of $3.80. BarriC went on to claim that those saying XRP will never move in price ‚Äúclearly don‚Äôt understand how crypto works.‚Äù The crypto analyst added that the ‚Äúexplosive price action‚Äù for XRP will definitely come at some point, and what is important is to have the ‚Äúfortitude‚Äù to hold until that time comes. He also suggested that there was no better time than now to accumulate XRP, stating there is a benefit in accumulating when people either don‚Äôt know enough about the crypto or outright hate it. This isn‚Äôt the first time that the crypto analyst has predicted that XRP will hit $1,000 at some point. Before now, he mentioned that XRP would hit this price level in the next five to ten years. He explained that this exponential price surge will happen thanks to the amount of money expected to flow into the crypto space. He also alluded to the Spot Bitcoin ETFs and how they helped drive up Bitcoin‚Äôs price. He believes something similar can happen for XRP when institutional demand comes for the crypto token through an XRP ETF. XRP Can Only Hit Three Figures At Most XRP YouTuber Moon Lambo has previously suggested that XRP‚Äôs price cannot go above three figures. He noted that there isn‚Äôt enough liquidity in the world to drive XRP‚Äôs price to such heights. He believes that mainstream adoption of XRP and liquidity flow will only cause XRP to rise to three digits, and it will still take ‚Äúmany market cycles‚Äù for XRP to even climb to such a price level. Related Reading: Kickstarting The Bitcoin Bull Run: Expert Says $70,000 Is The Level To Beat XRP possibly hitting three digits brings crypto analyst CryptoBull‚Äôs prediction into focus. The analyst recently predicted that XRP can climb to $154, although he didn‚Äôt state exactly when this will happen. Meanwhile, crypto analyst JackTheRippler predicted that XRP would rise to $100 when the legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple ended.

Ethereum Exchange Netflow Registered A Large Positive Spike Recently In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed about the latest trend that has been occurring in the exchange netflow metric for Ethereum. The ‚Äúexchange netflow‚Äù here refers to an on-chain indicator that tracks the net amount of any given cryptocurrency entering into or exiting the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Buy Signal That Led To 700% & 555% Rallies Forms Again When this metric‚Äôs value is positive, it means that investors are depositing a net number of tokens on these platforms right now. Generally, one of the main reasons holders may transfer to the exchanges is for selling-related purposes, so this trend can have bearish implications for the asset‚Äôs price. On the other hand, the negative indicator implies the exchanges are currently bleeding supply as outflows are outpacing the inflows. Such a trend may be a sign that the investors are accumulating, which can naturally be bullish for the coin. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum exchange netflow since the start of the year 2024: The graph shows that the Ethereum exchange netflow has registered a positive spike recently. At the height of this spike, the exchanges received 140,660 ETH in net deposits. At the current price of the cryptocurrency, this amount is equivalent to almost $547 million. This is a huge amount and the largest net deposit spree these central entities have witnessed since January. ‚ÄúHigh inflows to exchanges are typically a sign of selling behavior, as people either try to claim profits or succumb to FUD,‚Äù notes the analytics firm. Interestingly, though, since these deposits have come, the asset‚Äôs price has increased. This could suggest that either the whales making the inflows haven‚Äôt pulled the trigger on selling these coins yet, or they never planned to sell to begin with. Of course, it‚Äôs also possible that the market demand has been able to absorb the selling if the whales have indeed sold. In the scenario where the whales made the deposits with the intention of selling but haven‚Äôt made the trade yet, Ethereum could feel a bearish effect. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Soon? Quant Says This Ethereum Pattern Could Suggest So It now remains to be seen how the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price will develop in the coming days and if these large deposits will play any visible role at all.

Gox, a bankrupt Bitcoin exchange based in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan, has executed a large-scale Bitcoin transfer to several unknown wallets. This move has effectively spooked the broader cryptocurrency market, sparking concerns about potential selling pressures. Mt Gox Transfers Over $2.9 Billion Worth Of Bitcoin On May 27, Blockchain analytics platform, Arkham Intelligence unveiled a massive Bitcoin transaction initiated by Mt. Gox. The bankrupt Bitcoin exchange transferred a whopping 42,830 BTC valued at $2.9 billion, into several unknown wallets, marking the first transfer in five years. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 28,900% Rally To $154 For XRP Price, Here‚Äôs When The reason for this transfer remains unclear, however, the transaction comes after Mt. Gox‚Äôs recent announcement of reorganization plans to compensate its creditors and customers who were victims of its hack attack and bankruptcy in February 2014. Furthermore, these large-scale transactions have unsettled the crypto market, with many speculating about the potential impact on Bitcoin‚Äôs value. One crypto member disclosed that it might be time to dump BTC, suggesting that a potential sell-off could significantly impact the market. With Bitcoin already falling by 4.41% over the week, and trading below $70,000 at $67,834, a sell-off could trigger more price decreases for the cryptocurrency. Mt. Gox Goes On BTC Transfer Spree Following its 42,830 Bitcoin transfer, Blockchain tracker and analytics platform, Whale Alert revealed that Mt. Gox had executed a series of transactions on the same day. With just a few hours between each transaction, Mt. Gox initiated over five large-scale Bitcoin transfers. The first two transfers discovered by Whale Alert involved 3,999 BTC and 8,239 BTC worth approximately $277.6 million and $565 million respectively. The subsequent transactions saw Mt. Gox transferring 14,057 BTC and 16,589 BTC, valued at about $966.3 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. Mt. Gox‚Äôs largest transaction was a staggering 34,138 BTC valued at $2.3 billion, sent to an unknown wallet. The Bitcoin exchange also transferred another massive 32,137 BTC and 32,499 BTC, valued at approximately $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion respectively. In total, Mt. Gox moved over 141,659 BTC worth more than $9.6 billion in a single day to several unidentified wallet addresses. Mike Deutscher, a crypto analyst and avid Decentralized Finance (DeFi) supporter, has noted that such a significant Bitcoin transaction was likely to induce selling pressures in the Bitcoin market. He emphasized that any Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) related to Mt. Gox‚Äôs transfers should be viewed as a prime opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Will Crash 80% To $0.10, What‚Äôs The Trigger? Additionally, Deutscher reassured community members, stating that he was not concerned about the possible impacts of Mt. Gox‚Äôs large-scale transactions on the market. He pointed to the Bitcoin exchange‚Äôs disclosure of its 200,000 Bitcoin reimbursement plans to creditors since January 2024 as grounds for his confidence. Another crypto member, Mark Karpeles, also alleviated the community‚Äôs fears about Mt. Gox‚Äôs Bitcoin transfers.¬†‚ÄúAs far as I know everything is fine with MtGox.

42390788,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdLrUf,1716906653,The Future of AI Is Decentralized,"Younger readers may not remember, but cloud computing was once the future. The advent of unlimited computing and storage resources represented one of the few tech ‚Äòrevolutions‚Äô worthy of the name. But the age of AI has made the centralized cloud model not only obsolete but also an active danger for those building on it ‚Äî and for every user, too.  The AI Summit at Consensus 2024 takes place Friday, May 31, in Austin, Texas.  If that sounds a little hyperbolic, consider the recently uncovered vulnerability affecting Hugging Face, a major AI-as-a-Service platform. This vulnerability could potentially allow tampered models uploaded by users to execute arbitrary code via their inference API feature to gain escalated control. Fortunately, this was spotted in time and did not seem to have seriously affected users ‚Äî although researchers point out that such vulnerabilities are ‚Äúfar from unique.‚Äù  The problem here isn‚Äôt with AI at all; it‚Äôs the outdated, centralized, X-as-a-Service models, where there‚Äôs no incentive either to guarantee the security of their systems or to develop applications that the market and ordinary users want. The preferred future of AI ‚Äî where it is safe, secure, and, above all, able to draw on vast compute resources ‚Äî can only be achieved by flipping the cloud on its head and embracing the decentralization revolution.  ‚ÄòBig Cloud‚Äô and the monopolization of AI  Megacorps like Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, and Amazon dominate the AI field because they have the immense financial, human, and compute resources necessary to make it work at scale.  This is terrible for the development of AI, and completely antithetical to its democratizing potential. When algorithms and applications are built by a small coterie of devs at trillion-dollar California companies, it imposes a blinkered, one-dimensional, and incredibly subjective bias on AI agents. This affects everything from financial services, to creativity‚Ä¶even to human interactions.  There are equally compelling technical arguments against the monopolization of the AI market. Throughout its training process, AI must feed on a constant diet of new data, including from other AI applications. Yet the current centralizing tendencies of Big AI mean platforms and applications remain highly siloed, even with open-source models. This hinders innovation and leaves the field open for errors or malicious applications which can multiply with dizzying, potentially catastrophic consequences.  What‚Äôs more, the centralized model has enormous and obvious risks when it comes to safeguarding users‚Äô personal data, privacy, and, in many cases, financial information. When one entity holds huge volumes of sensitive and business-critical data, it represents a single point of failure for attackers and enables one provider to censor or deny services to its users based on arbitrary and unchallengeable decisions.  Democratization through decentralization  When it comes to AI, the cloud model is clearly a dangerous dead-end. AI requires such phenomenal amounts of computing power that it stretches the capabilities of even the hyperscale centralized cloud platforms and the microchip industry that serves them. The chip shortage is so severe that there is now an astonishing 52-week wait for the H-100 servers used by the industry‚Äôs most advanced AI applications.  Through decentralization, we can eliminate this problem at a stroke by creating a network of nodes that harness huge reserves of unused CPU power. This modular approach of decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) is perfect for multiple reasons: it‚Äôs almost infinitely scalable, far cheaper than spinning up new servers with your cloud provider (costs are typically around 80% lower), and contributes to parallel computing and the de-siloization of AI, so applications can more easily learn from each other. In addition, decentralized AI, enabled by blockchain technology, offers innovative ways to reward creators of large language models (LLMs) through crypto tokens and smart contracts - providing a sustainable and equitable model for rewarding innovation and contribution in the AI field.  The rise of new economic models ‚Äî in particular, those based on digital tokens ‚Äî not only increases the need for more secure decentralized infrastructure; it supports it, too. Basing the AI ecosystem on a token economy incentivises developers to create more secure AI agents, and enables them to deliver these models into a crypto wallet for ownership. This gives users complete peace of mind that their data is theirs and cannot be shared without their knowledge or permission.  Perhaps most importantly of all, the token model means that AI projects will deliver what the market truly wants and needs, as compute and storage costs reflect the iron law of supply-and-demand. With the current monopolization, there is no incentive for AI to serve real-life needs and demands. Under decentralization, users themselves can reward developers based on an AI agent‚Äôs popularity or the good it brings to the world. This could not be more different from the Big Tech oligarchy that currently ‚Äî but not for long ‚Äî rules the roost of AI.  Decentralization also provides an answer to vulnerabilities we‚Äôve seen on platforms like Hugging Face. With the rapid evolution of blockchain technology ‚Äî in particular, zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs ‚Äî we now have a range of tools to ensure the security and provenance of AI applications. For those of us close to these developments, we can often forget the sheer speed and profundity of this technological transformation. It‚Äôs not that traditional cloud providers are fighting tooth-and-nail to retain outdated models; it‚Äôs simply that decentralization and ZK are very recent inventions, and it‚Äôs naturally taking a little time for industry players to realize how they can best be applied in their (and their customers‚Äô) interests.  It‚Äôs largely a matter of education: to show that decentralized AI architecture, when built correctly, is private and secure by design, with all on-chain data encrypted yet still supporting interaction and collaboration between different projects, nodes and parties.  With AI, centralization doesn‚Äôt work on any level: technical, philosophical, ethical, or market. What‚Äôs more, I suggest that with people growing increasingly weary (and wary) of the outsized influence of Big Tech ‚Äî from developers to tech providers to everyday users like you and me ‚Äî the time has clearly come for a revolution of our own.

By analyzing past market behavior and trends, the expert has discovered crucial indicators that suggest Bitcoin‚Äôs potential to outperform previous highs and reach unprecedented heights. Most Accurate Bitcoin Price Bands Crypto Con‚Äôs analysis delves into Bitcoin‚Äôs current behavior based on its price bands at several levels, particularly 3 levels, as shown in his chart. According to the analyst, level 3 is currently one of the most precise bands for the crypto asset, which is valued at $91,539. The expert noted that even with consolidation at level 2.5, the repercussions of this development are already becoming apparent. As a result, the major goal for BTC is reaching the level 3 price band. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Aims Higher: Bullish Trend Signals New Peaks Ahead Furthermore, he underscored there has never been a cycle in which the top band of the cycle is not precisely touched, which is valued at $123,832, and this is currently witnessing an increase. Thus, at the conclusion of the Bitcoin parabola, the cycle top band will have its biggest growth. A further dive into BTC‚Äôs cycle top, Crypto Con has managed to pinpoint the past 2 accurate cycle tops, by employing basic indicators. Specifically, the bottom of the first early top (a yellow dot identified in his chart) in Green Year is when these patterns start. The lowest points of the trend that have been retested the most often are used by these patterns. However, Bitcoin recently reached the cycle‚Äôs line at the $74,000 price level, which is the problem. With BTC reaching a new all-time high a year ahead of schedule, it has created an unnatural collision with the trend. Due to this, the expert believes that the line this cycle based on BTC‚Äôs fast price action will not rule this cycle peak. So far, Crypto Con claims there will be unprecedented price movement, which will trigger some cycle top measures to break. However, it is still beneficial to pay attention to past trends in order to determine BTC‚Äôs price action. BTC Poised For 6-Figure Price Target As Bitcoin continues to display resilience, macro strategist Henrik Zeberg has also forecasted a 6-figure target for the digital assets in the coming months. Zeberg claims¬†that the crypto asset is already preparing to enter an upward trend that began on May 20. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $100,000: Infamous Head And Shoulders Pattern Appears To Signal The Start Of Another Rally As a result, Zeberg anticipates an over 64% increase by the third of this year, putting his target between $110,000 and $115,000. According to the expert, a pattern of highs and lows will serve as a catalyst for the aforementioned price levels.

In fact, he chanted the word ‚ÄúDevelopers‚Äù almost 14 times without rest, working up a huge sweat as he paced across the stage with excitement.  Ballmer realised how important developers would be to Microsoft‚Äôs long-term success. At the time, Microsoft was far from the behemoth it‚Äôs become today and Ballmer wanted Microsoft to become the home for developers: no matter what they wanted to build, Ballmer wanted them to build it with Microsoft.  Fast forward to today, and Ballmer‚Äôs words ring truer than ever. Blockchains live and die by the developers they attract. Without developers, who‚Äôs going to build on all those beautiful Layer 1s or Layer 2s (and even Layer 3s)? And not just any developer. Blockchains need to attract the best developers to thrive.  That‚Äôs why for the first time in history, we decided to host an in-person hackathon at Consensus and bring the developers to town.  To bring the best developers to Consensus, CoinDesk teamed up with EasyA, the Web3 learning app with one of the fastest growing developer communities globally. Together, we‚Äôve picked the world‚Äôs best developers to hack with us on the world‚Äôs leading blockchains for three days.  Hosted right above the Consensus conference itself, the EasyA Consensus Hackathon is a melting pot of the world‚Äôs best developers not only across the U.S. but also globally. EasyA have invited their community, known as gigabrains (of which there are nearly 1 million around the world), to apply for the hackathon. And with thousands having already applied to hack in-person at Consensus this year, the gigabrains are certainly excited about the opportunities to build.  The stakes have never been higher. The top 500 developers will compete for over $200,000 in prize money and millions more in grants and VC funding. The ultimate goal? Not just attract the best developers to Consensus but also see them build long-lasting projects across the ecosystems participating.  EasyA alumni have already founded projects valued at over $2.5 billion and won funding from top VCs like a16z, Founders Fund, YC and many more. Just last month, Cognition AI, founded by EasyA hackathon winner Walden Yan, was valued at $2 billion. Walden first pitched his idea for DALLE on the blockchain at an EasyA hackathon at Harvard. Two years later, he‚Äôs built a transformative company..  If you‚Äôre a developer, don‚Äôt miss your chance to be part of Consensus history by participating in our first ever in-person hackathon.

42390802,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdLsZL,1716903000,Consensus 2024 Week: The House Passed a Market Structure Bill,"The House of Representatives voting overwhelmingly in favor of a crypto market structure bill is an interesting prelude to CoinDesk's annual conference. We'll be talking about these things in Austin this week.  You‚Äôre reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Sea change?  The narrative  Recent passage of crypto bills ‚Äì even if they don't become law ‚Äì may herald a new era in how Washington, D.C. views the industry.  Why it matters  Crypto industry participants have called for Congress to create new bright lines for how digital assets are regulated for years. This month's votes, even if mostly symbolic, bring those hopes a step closer.  Breaking it down  Seventy-one Democrats and 208 Republicans voted in favor of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act last week. Just three Republicans and 133 Democrats voted against. This comes on the heels of the vote earlier this month to repeal SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which saw votes from 30-some Democrats in both the House and Senate.  The phrase I've heard thrown around these last few weeks is ""sea change."" Between former U.S. President (and current Republican frontrunner) Donald Trump openly appealing to people who might have crypto as an important election issue to the votes over the last few weeks, this industry is (finally?) bursting onto the political scene in a way we haven't seen before.  Last week also saw the SEC mass-approve 19b-4 forms from a number of exchanges hoping to list and trade shares of spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a stunning reversal from an expected mass denial just two weeks ago.  So what's changed?  The more cynical among you may say that these votes are purely an election play, that they never would have happened in another year. And the election this November is undoubtedly playing some sort of role in these votes.  U.S. President Joe Biden announced he would veto the SAB 121 repeal, giving cover to Democrats to vote in favor of it, and the FIT21 bill has no real counterpart in the Senate, meaning voting for it can only boost Democrats among people who see being pro-crypto as a factor.  But a day after the FIT21 vote, a bill banning the U.S. Federal Reserve from issuing or digging further into a central bank digital currency passed mostly along party lines, with few defections. The debate was much more contentious but the result does suggest the situation isn't just purely pro or anti-crypto (of course, this depends on whether you view CBDCs as being a pro or anti-crypto issue too).  It's also worth noting that FIT21 had quite a bit of momentum last year, passing out of both the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees and looking set for a House vote before then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was ejected from his role through a vote called by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).  The House did not appear to recover from the weeks of lost time, having to turn to budget bills instead of resuming other votes after current Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was named to the post.  In other words, while there is momentum now that didn't seem to exist last year, these bills also didn't come out of nowhere; Congress has been laying the groundwork for quite some time.  That there is an election this year and the crypto industry is putting together a huge war chest might just be the final sparks that led to this month's results. We've already seen interest groups' funds go toward influencing primaries and elections, a fact which other members of Congress are undoubtedly aware of.  Still, there is real interest in crypto now in a way we haven't seen before. The big question is will the desire to work on crypto legislation continue after the U.S. election in November during the lame-duck session, or will a new Congress take up legislation after the members are sworn in in January.  Contributing factors to these questions obviously include what Congress (and the presidency) look like after the election, and whether there's more bipartisan work to be done on these issues or if either major party will have an edge in controlling the wheels of influence.  One other note: Last week the SEC approved the 19b-4 forms from exchanges hoping to list and trade spot ether ETF products. It still has to approve the S-1 forms by the issuers themselves to create the products. There's been speculation that this too shows a shift in the political winds around crypto. But it is worth remembering that the SEC is supposed to be an independent agency, and any suggestion that the administration is influencing it ‚Äì either before, to reject the ETFs, or more recently, to approve them ‚Äì suggests something far more troubling than just D.C.'s reception to crypto. There's also so far been zero evidence provided to support the idea that the Biden administration leaned on the SEC to approve the ether ETFs.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler said last week that the agency's decision-making was informed by last year's famous court decision on spot bitcoin ETFs, which also conveniently provides a more reasonable explanation for why the spot ether ETFs are moving ahead.  We'll be talking about these issues and what might happen next in Austin. If you're in town, come say hi, especially on Thursday at our annual Policy Summit.

Bitcoin Soars As Sentiment Turns Red Hot","Bitcoin (BTC) continues its captivating dance near its all-time high, leaving investors to ponder whether it‚Äôs a victory lap or a prelude to a potential tumble. While the price sits stubbornly around $68,000, new data reveals a market brimming with ‚Äúextreme greed,‚Äù according to the Crypto Fear and Greed Index. This suggests investors are piling on, fueled by the belief that the digital gold is on an unstoppable ascent. However, beneath the surface of this bullish fervor lurk shadows of potential setbacks. Let‚Äôs dissect the forces shaping Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. Related Reading: Floki Floats 22% On Marketing Blitz, Aims For ‚ÄòWorld‚Äôs Most Used Crypto‚Äô Title Greed For Bitcoin Up The Fear and Greed Index at 74 paints a picture of a market intoxicated by optimism. Investors are chomping at the bit, accumulating more BTC in anticipation of a price surge. This bullish sentiment might very well be a self-fulfilling prophecy, but a note of caution is necessary. Historically, periods of extreme greed have often ended with sharp corrections. Profit Taking: The Looming Sell-Off? With BTC brushing shoulders with its all-time high, the allure of profit-taking becomes irresistible for some investors. The temptation to cash out and lock in gains could trigger a wave of selling, applying downward pressure on the price. This dynamic highlights the double-edged sword of profitability. While it bolsters sentiment, it can also ignite a sell-off if not managed strategically. Short-Term Holders: A Recipe For Volatility? The analysis also reveals a rise in short-term holders (STHs). These investors, unlike their long-term counterparts, are more likely to react impulsively to market fluctuations. A sudden dip in price could trigger panic selling from these STHs, leading to short-term volatility for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Price Prediction: Analyst Sparks Bullish Frenzy With $10 Target Greed: Bullish Sentiment The bullish sentiment fueled by the Fear and Greed Index is a positive force. However, the risks of profit-taking, short-term holder behavior, and potential future miner capitulation cannot be ignored. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin can overcome these hurdles and propel itself to new heights or succumb to a correction. Miners: A Force To Be Reckoned With Meanwhile, miners ‚Äì the lifeblood of the Bitcoin network ‚Äì play a crucial role in price stability. When miner revenue dips, they‚Äôre forced to sell their BTC holdings to cover operational costs. This selling pressure can significantly impact the price. However, the good news is that miner revenue has been on an upswing recently, alleviating some concerns about a miner-induced sell-off.

42390785,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdLrA9,1716901200,"Ethereum-Based Domain Protocol ENS Seeks Own L2, Possibly With ZK Rollups","Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Labs, the company behind the ENS domain name protocol, proposed Tuesday to go through a complete architectural redesign that would turn the network into a layer-2 blockchain.  The proposal, dubbed ‚ÄúENSv2,‚Äù will overhaul the project's registry system as part of the transformation into a layer 2, which is an auxiliary network that provides cheaper transaction fees that can then be settled to the base blockchain, Ethereum.  ENS Labs Executive Director Khori Whittaker initially told CoinDesk in an interview that the project was leaning toward using technology from the layer-2 chain-development kit ZK Stack from Matter Labs, which also was the primary developer behind the layer 2 zkSync.  Later, a spokesperson told CoinDesk that: ""ENS Labs do not have a determined stack yet for the L2 expansion with all options still on the table. There have been discussions about ZK rollups in particular but no definitive decisions have been made as of yet.‚Äù  The new initiative by ENS follows a new blockchain trend, where some protocols atop Ethereum and even some alternative layer-1 blockchains are migrating to become layer-2 networks, to address needs of their communities, such as the desire for cheaper fees or customization. Earlier this month, the layer-1 chain Celo concluded an 8 month search for its new layer-2 home, settling on Optimism‚Äôs technology to help propel them.  ‚ÄúI want us to get the gas price as close to zero as possible,‚Äù said Whittaker. ‚ÄúSo I'm excited about tons of activity using ENS names and ENS profiles.‚Äù  Prioritizing privacy, security  ENS, founded in 2017 by former Ethereum Foundation employees Nick Johnson and Alex Van de Sande, is designed to map cryptocurrency addresses ‚Äì typically consisting of long strings of letters and words ‚Äì to human-readable names like ""Alice.eth."" In its current configuration, the protocol exists merely as smart contracts atop Ethereum.  The team spent some time looking at layer-2 technologies from Arbitrum, Optimism and zkSync before settling on Matter Labs‚Äô ZK Stack, Whittaker initially told CoinDesk, but the team later clarified that they were looking at zero-knowledge rollups. The ZK Stack is a customizable software toolkit that lets developers spin up their own chains based on zkSync‚Äôs technology. A key component of the ZK stack, as well as other ZK rollups, is that it uses zero-knowledge proofs, a type of cryptography that's one of hottest trends in blockchain.  Many of the leading layer-2 projects have their own customizable stacks, like Polygon‚Äôs CDK which is home to OKX‚Äôs layer 2 ‚ÄúX Layer,‚Äù and Optimism‚Äôs OP Stack which is home to Coinbase‚Äôs ‚ÄúBase,‚Äù and Worldcoin‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorldchain,‚Äù in addition to Celo.  While assessing which stack to pick, privacy and security were at the top of the list, Whittaker said.  ‚ÄúFrom my perspective, that's what I'm looking at the various L2 stacks,‚Äù Whittaker said.  With the release of the proposal, the ENS DAO ‚Äì the decentralized governing body behind the ENS protocol ‚Äì will vote on whether it approves the changes, kicking off a period of back-and-forth dialogue.  ‚ÄúThat'll probably take two months or so for that whole process to go, and then once we're all aligned and we get the thumbs up, then we're off to the races to build,‚Äù Whittaker said.

The new permissionless service aimed at DeFi users targets 15% yields sourced from fully collateralized loans to the largest institutions in the crypto space.  Cryptocurrency lending firm Maple Finance has unveiled Syrup, a new loans platform and rewards token of the same name, aiming to bridge the gap between institutional-friendly yield-bearing digital assets and the permissionless world of decentralized finance (DeFi).  Maple‚Äôs Syrup promises users yields of 15% by depositing Circle‚Äôs USDC stablecoin into the platform, for which those users receive LP tokens (syrupUSDC), with additional yield in the form of ‚ÄúDrips,‚Äù a loyalty payment derived from using the SYRUP rewards token, Maple said in a press release on Tuesday.  Holders of MPL, Maple's native token, will be out to migrate to the SYRUP token at a one-for-one basis.  Many centralized crypto lending firms took a battering over the last couple of years. Maple has weathered the storms of the bear market thanks to its buttoned-up approach, offering permission-only deposits from accredited investors with full know-your-customer (KYC) checks, which allows the firm to operate in the U.S. serving larger regulation-conscious institutions, said Maple co-founder Joe Flanagan.  ‚ÄúWe want to maintain that institutional focus, but also ensure we're staying close to our DeFi roots,‚Äù Flanagan said in an interview. ‚ÄúThe launch of syrup enables us to operate within the broader DeFi ecosystem. So we can bring the same institutional quality yields that are sourced from over collateralized loans to the largest institutions in the space, and bring that into a DeFi audience.‚Äù",POSITIVE,USDC,BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING | USDC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/05/28/crypto-lending-firm-maple-finance-unveils-syrup-yield-platform-and-rewards-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b4c0f67c39886c315500502cb041d216a0a915e7-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Solana validators are set to get a little more SOL tokens after a governance proposal to give them 100% of priority fees was passed late Monday with 77% in favor. In the previous model, half of the fees in a priority transaction were erased while the other half went to the validators. This created a situation where validators were said to be making ‚Äúside deals‚Äù with transaction submitters to get more SOL, as per proposal creator tao-stones on the Solana governance forum. Giving all the priority fees to the validators would ensure that validators are more focused on keeping the network safe and running smoothly, tao-stones said. SOL has increased by around 1.15% in the last 24 hours, trading at about $167.70, according to CoinDesk Indices data.  Elwood Technologies, the cryptocurrency-focused trade execution and risk management platform backed by billionaire hedge fund manager Alan Howard, is in talks to sell part of the business, according to people with knowledge of the situation. Elwood is focusing on its existing portfolio management and risk management software-as-a-service business and less on the trading side, one of the people said. Howard‚Äôs current reorganization of his portfolio of crypto investments has resulted in changes at Elwood, another person said. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Howard was looking to sell his stakes in crypto exchange Bitpanda and custody firm Copper to focus on Brevan Howard Digital.

Bernstein said this suggests flows of more than $100 billion in the next two years into crypto ETFs.  The U.S. approval of an ether spot ETF has positive implications for rival tokens like solana, the broker said.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds are expected to grow to a $450 billion market based on our crypto price forecasts, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Tuesday.  ‚ÄúThis would signify flows exceeding $100 billion over the next 18-24 months into crypto ETFs,‚Äù analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote.

28578915,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=610188,1716897641,Why The Bitcoin Halving Is Not Priced In And What‚Äôs Next: Expert,"In his latest video update on YouTube, renowned crypto analyst Rekt Capital delved into the complex dynamics surrounding Bitcoin‚Äôs halving events, articulating a compelling case for why the market has yet to fully price in the halving which took place on April 19. Drawing on historical data and patterns, Rekt Capital provided an in-depth analysis of the cyclical nature of Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements post-halving, suggesting that substantial growth phases still lie ahead. Why The Bitcoin Halving Is Not Priced In Rekt Capital began by revisiting the historical impact of Bitcoin halvings, which occur approximately every four years and reduce the block reward received by miners by half. This constriction in supply, if demand remains constant or increases, typically leads to a significant price increase. ‚ÄúThe Bitcoin halving is not priced in,‚Äù Rekt Capital asserted, pointing out that each previous halving led to a rally that not only reached but also surpassed previous all-time highs. ‚ÄúThe halving every four years always precedes a fantastic surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price action towards new all-time highs,‚Äù he noted. This consistent pattern forms a compelling narrative that the post-halving market dynamics are predictable to a degree, yet complex enough to remain partially unanticipated by the market. ‚ÄúTwo phases remain in the cycle: The Post-Halving Re-Accumulation phase (red) and the Parabolic Rally phase (green),‚Äù he stated. Related Reading: Parabolic Rally In The Making? Bitcoin Regains $70,000 As Traders‚Äô Paper Profits Collapse To 3% Focusing on the reaccumulation phase that traditionally follows each halving, Rekt Capital highlighted that this phase typically lasts about 160 days. During this period, the market often sees a consolidation of price before a breakout leads to a parabolic rally. ‚ÄúWe are currently in a reaccumulation period again in this cycle. This is post-halving reaccumulation,‚Äù he stated, emphasizing the significance of this phase in setting the stage for the next bull run. The analyst elaborated on the nature of these cycles, noting deviations in the current trends compared to past cycles. ‚ÄúThis cycle is exhibiting an accelerated rate, with new all-time highs appearing 260 days prior to the halving, a first in Bitcoin‚Äôs history,‚Äù he explained. Such deviations suggest that while historical patterns provide a roadmap, each cycle can introduce new dynamics that affect market behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bargains: Expert Reveals Ideal Buy Zones For Maximum Gain Rekt Capital did not overlook the potential risks and market corrections that could occur. He warned of the initial rejection often seen after reaching the high range of post-halving prices, a trend noted in previous cycles. ‚ÄúEvery time we‚Äôve seen an initial attempt to get to the range high resistance after the halving, that first attempt after the halving is one that rejects,‚Äù he explained. This observation is crucial for investors expecting immediate gains post-halving, as it tempers overly optimistic expectations with a realistic view of possible short-term retracements. The analyst also addressed the issue of diminishing returns in successive cycles, a factor that seasoned Bitcoin investors watch closely. While each cycle‚Äôs peak has historically been higher than the last, the rate of growth has slowed. ‚ÄúIf this was a one-to-one extension from what we saw in the previous cycle, getting us to $250,000 might be unrealistic this time around, and we are probably looking at a more subdued increase,‚Äù he predicted. Nonetheless, Rekt Capital maintained a bullish outlook for the long term, suggesting that while the explosive growth rates of early cycles might not repeat, the overall upward trajectory of Bitcoin‚Äôs price post-halving remains intact. ‚ÄúThis is going to be the most parabolic phase of the cycle where we see those gains come very quickly in a short space of time,‚Äù he concluded, affirming the significant opportunities that lie ahead for Bitcoin investors. At press time, BTC traded at $68,561.

By June 1, 2024, all crypto platforms in Hong Kong must be either licensed or ‚Äúdeemed-to-be-licensed.""  Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) will conduct on-site inspections of those crypto trading platforms interested in continuing to pursue their licensing applications as a key deadline looms, the regulator announced Tuesday.  By June 1, 2024, all crypto platforms providing trading services known as virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs) in Hong Kong must be either licensed by the SFC or ‚Äúdeemed-to-be-licensed,‚Äù which is a temporary arrangement during the process to get fully compliant. Beyond that deadline, it would be a ""criminal offence to operate in Hong Kong"" in breach of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism laws, the SFC said.  ""In the coming months, whilst the deemed-to-be-licensed VATP applicants pursue their applications, the SFC will conduct on-site inspections to ascertain their compliance with the SFC‚Äôs regulatory requirements, with a particular focus on their safeguarding of client assets and know-your-client processes,"" the announcement said.  OSL Digital Securities Limited and Hash Blockchain Limited are the only two entities currently listed as licensed by the SFC. The applications of 18 entities remain in the system, while 11 entities have either withdrawn their applications or have been removed. Recently, crypto exchange OKX and Huobi Hong Kong withdrew their applications.  Notably, by June 1, it will be clear how many of the 18 entities remain in the SFC system as ""deemed-to-be-licensed."" Hong Kong's push to become a major crypto hub could come under scrutiny if several or some of the 18 applicants don't move past this important deadline.  The SFC said it did not expect applicants to actively market their services or onboard new retail clients before being fully licensed.  ""It's unsurprising that SFC plans to introduce a higher level of scrutiny than is typical during an application process, such as onsite inspections,"" said Angela Ang, a senior policy adviser for blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs. ""The recent spate of application withdrawals may also be an effort by the SFC to clean house before the deeming arrangement comes into effect.""

The previous resistance is turned into support and #DOT can now aim for higher prices. I expect #Polkadot to be trading around the $10 soon ! pic.twitter.com/7VBewIyVNk ‚Äî Crypto Yapper (@CryptoYapper) May 26, 2024 Further reinforcing this optimistic outlook is Polkadot‚Äôs position above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), a key technical indicator used to assess the long-term trend of an asset. Trading above the 200-day SMA generally signifies a sustained uptrend, which bolsters investor confidence and supports predictions of continued growth. Impressive Metrics Polkadot‚Äôs impressive market performance is reflected in its significant trading volume and market capitalization. Over the past 24 hours, DOT has seen a trading volume of $454 million and boasts a market capitalization of $7.35 billion. These metrics underscore the cryptocurrency‚Äôs high liquidity, which is crucial for accommodating large trades without causing drastic price swings. Additionally, Polkadot‚Äôs price performance over the past year has been notably bullish, with a 35% increase. This upward trajectory is significant, particularly as the token trades above its token sale price, delivering substantial returns to early investors. Such performance metrics are likely to attract new buyers and long-term holders, further driving demand and price appreciation. Investor Sentiment: A Greedy Market The Fear & Greed Index, a popular tool used to gauge market sentiment in the cryptocurrency space, is currently displaying a score of 75 (Greed) for Polkadot. This high score indicates strong investor interest and confidence in DOT, suggesting that market participants are optimistic about its future prospects. High liquidity and positive market sentiment create a favorable environment for further price increases. Investors, both retail and institutional, are drawn to assets that demonstrate stability and potential for growth, and Polkadot‚Äôs current metrics position it as a promising investment opportunity.

GameStop stock rallies have often preceded a rise in crypto meme coins.  Several dog-themed tokens started to move higher Tuesday as stocks of video game retailer GameStop (NYSE: GME) surged over 19% in pre-market trading.  Floki (FLOKI) and dogwifhat (WIF), two tokens on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, were respectively up as much as 8% since the start of Asian trading hours. Dogecoin (DOGE) rose 2% in the past four hours, while Solana-based bonk (BONK) was up 5.5%.  Meme tokens tend to mirror movements in stocks such as GameStop and cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE: AME). Some investors perceive these movements as a sign of euphoria, which can lead to irrational trading around certain stocks and meme coins.  In an earlier interview, Mog token developer Shisui told CoinDesk that much of the ‚ÄúGamestop mania had spilled over to $DOGE and other meme coins‚Äù in 2021‚Äîan indication of a repeat on the cards if GME continues to gain favor among retail traders.

Just about everybody knows what a bitcoin is, now, and a lot of people reportedly think cryptocurrencies will figure into their financial futures.  One in three U.S. voters said they'll consider a political candidate's position on cryptocurrencies before making a voting decision, according to a new Harris Poll examination of likely U.S. voters.  While those 33% are taking a keen interest, the online survey of more than 1,700 people ‚Äì funded by bitcoin ETF issuer Grayscale ‚Äì found 77% said a U.S. presidential candidate should at least have an ""informed perspective"" on crypto. And they're evenly split on which political party is the leader in digital assets issues.  The new polling followed up on a similar round of questioning late last year, concluding people are increasingly likely to believe that crypto will eventually wind up in their investment portfolios (47%), which could further explain their political interest.  ""Likely American voters from across the political spectrum indicate a heightened interest in investing in crypto assets and in supporting candidates well-versed in the emerging technologies,‚Äù said Zach Pandl, Grayscale‚Äôs head of research, in a statement.  Read more: Trump Becomes First Major Party Candidate to Accept Crypto Donations  Almost everybody ‚Äì all but 2% ‚Äì had at least heard of bitcoin {{BTC}}. A wide segment of voters claimed they're also familiar with Ethereum's ether {{ETH}}, with less than half (46%) saying they'd never heard of it. About 17% of voters say they've invested in bitcoin, putting that asset nearly as high as those who say they have bonds, and significantly higher than those who invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  In a point that could be especially interesting to the firms winning preliminary approvals last week on their efforts to build ETH ETFs, 24% in the survey said this new option would make them more open to investing.  And 44% of the voters think to some degree that ""crypto and blockchain technology are the future of finance"" ‚Äì up four percentage points from responses to the same question asked last year. But they want government oversight, with 52% of respondents saying they'd be more likely to put their money into digital assets if the field gets more regulation.  This latest poll showed a larger segment of the voting population keenly interested in candidates' crypto views than another recent poll of swing-state voters, which had put that level at 21%.

The Shiba Inu-inspired cryptocurrency announced plans for its most aggressive marketing campaign yet, sending its token price skyrocketing. Related Reading: Red Hot Chiliz: Analyst Predicts 4x Your Money With Upcoming Breakout Floki‚Äôs Aggressive Marketing Push Floki‚Äôs marketing director, Sabre, remained tight-lipped about the specifics, but promised the upcoming effort would dwarf anything they‚Äôve done in the past two years. This news, coupled with the announcement of Floki futures trading on Coinbase coming May 30th, fueled a 24-hour price surge of 22%, propelling Floki to the top of the memecoin heap. Shout out to those with longer term memories that know what to expect from #Floki and our ‚Ñ¢ moves.

The marketing blitz shows they‚Äôre serious about taking over the memecoin space, and Coinbase listing futures is like getting a thumbs-up from the crypto trailblazers themselves. According to Sabre, the upcoming marketing push will help Floki in ‚Äúdominating‚Äù the memecoin field and achieving its objective of becoming the ‚Äúmost widely utilized cryptocurrency in the world.‚Äù Floki isn‚Äôt the only dog chasing its tail in the memecoin race. Coinbase is also adding rival memecoins Shiba Inu and Bonk to its futures roster. But with Floki leading the pack in price gains, it seems to have stolen the early show. The price rally marks a significant turnaround for the coin. After bottoming out in April, the token has been on a steady climb, but Monday‚Äôs announcement ignited a breakout, pushing prices to an 11-week high. This represents a staggering 160% increase since mid-April. However, analysts caution that Floki‚Äôs victory lap might be premature. The memecoin market is notoriously fickle, and external factors like economic headwinds and the ever-present threat of dogecoin dominance could throw Floki a curveball. Additionally, the success of Floki‚Äôs marketing campaign remains a mystery. Floki: Market Performance The memecoin‚Äôs most recent major marketing campaign targeted visitors in New York‚Äôs Times Square, where the brand was emblazoned on screens near the Nasdaq billboard for two months, starting on March 15. Today, the price of FLOKI is $0.00027, with a 24-hour trading volume of $1,025,844,340.44. This marks a 27.82% increase over the past week. With a circulating supply of nearly 10 trillion, the market cap stands at $2.6 billion.

Despite its position as the 9th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Wacy remains bullish on the potential of Toncoin (TON), a third-generation blockchain. ‚ÄúAltseason is coming while Ethereum shines. Now is the time to pick your biggest bets with high conviction. L1s are about to boom, and here is my under-radar pick!‚Äù Wacy declared. He emphasized the significance of Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) blockchains as foundational elements for mass crypto adoption, due to their role in supporting various projects and infrastructure. ‚ÄúWatching various projects, one realizes that L1 is the most clear and simple thesis for retail,‚Äù he added. Related Reading: Ethereum Shifts Gears: Breaks Key Resistance, New All-Time Highs Next TON, originally developed by the Telegram team and later transitioned to an independent developer community, is recognized for its high performance and scalability. One of its standout features is its deep integration with the Telegram messaging app, which boasts over 900 million monthly active users. This integration is seen as a crucial lever for widespread crypto adoption. In terms of recent achievements, the TON ecosystem has shown remarkable growth. The blockchain‚Äôs Total Value Locked (TVL) has increased fifteenfold in the last three months, and the price of TON has tripled. This surge is accompanied by a flurry of positive developments and new listings. One notable project within the TON ecosystem is Notcoin (NOT), a Web3 gaming project that has quickly gained traction. Since its launch earlier this year, Notcoin has attracted a vast user base, reaching 35 million players who engage with the game to mine tokens. These tokens were recently converted into NOT coins and listed on exchanges. ‚ÄúOn May 16, the day of the listing, approximately 13 million unique Notcoin users received NOT, making it the largest meme token by number of holders,‚Äù Wacy highlighted. Remarkably, NOT is outpacing all other memecoins like DOGE (4.8 million holders), SHIB (1.4 million holders), BONK (720,000 holders) and PEPE (220,000 holders). Related Reading: Is Solana Becoming The Preferred Choice For Ethereum Developers? SOL‚Äôs Uptrend Suggests A Shift Further bolstering TON‚Äôs appeal, the blockchain recently introduced the native support of USDT (Tether), providing an accessible platform for Telegram‚Äôs massive user base to engage in peer-to-peer payments. This development aligns with TON‚Äôs strategy to facilitate seamless integration of Web3 services into everyday activities. Wacy also shed light on the Open League, a long-term incentive program designed to foster competition and collaboration among TON projects. The program, now in its third season, distributes millions of Toncoin to participants, boosting ecosystem engagement. In addition, the STON.fi decentralized exchange (DEX) on TON has emerged as a leader in terms of ease of use and integration. Its USDT/TON pool recently surpassed $100 million in TVL, only four weeks after the launch of USDT on the network. ‚ÄúThe TON/USDt pool is currently boosted with 105% APY, attracting significant investments,‚Äù Wacy noted, mentioning a recent funding round led by CoinFund among other investors. As the TON ecosystem continues to expand and evolve, it is clear that its combination of technological innovation, strategic partnerships, and community engagement positions it as a formidable player in the blockchain space. Alex Wacy‚Äôs endorsement underscores the potential for TON to lead the market on the back of an altcoin season sparked by the recent rise of Ethereum. At press time, TON traded at $6.33.

The previous model split priority fees between burning and rewarding validators, which led to side deals with transaction submitters.  Solana validators are set to get a little more SOL tokens after a governance proposal to give them 100% of priority fees was passed late Monday with 77% in favor, governance data shows.  Validators are important participants in a blockchain network as they run software to confirm transactions and maintain security. Solana priority fees are additional fees users can pay to increase the likelihood of their transactions being processed more quickly by the network.  In the previous model, half of the fees in a priority transaction were erased while the other half went to the validators. This created a situation where validators were said to be making ‚Äúside deals‚Äù with transaction submitters to get more SOL, as per proposal creator tao-stones on the Solana governance forum.  Giving all the priority fees to the validators would ensure that validators are more focused on keeping the network safe and running smoothly, tao-stones said.

Gox wallets to an unknown address in thirteen transactions, possibly as part of a plan to repay creditors by October 31, 2024.  The market reacted bearishly to these movements, with Bitcoin dropping by 1.4% to as low as $67,680 after reaching a high of over $70,000 on Monday.  Wallets belonging to the defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox transferred over 140,000 bitcoin (BTC), valued at around $9 billion, to an unknown address starting early Asian morning hours on Tuesday.  Mt. Gox, once the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, closed in 2014 after it was revealed that it had lost hundreds of thousands of bitcoin in a hack. Creditors have since awaited the repayment of their holdings - one that is largely considered to add selling pressure to BTC markets.  In a press release, rehabilitation trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi said that no sale of bitcoin or bitcoin cash (BCH) had taken place and that the group was ""managing bitcoin and bitcoin cash in a secure manner.""  Wallet activity shows the movements were done over thirteen transactions. A likely test transaction worth $3 was made on May 20, and another smaller transaction of $160 was done early Tuesday. The remaining transactions ranged from $1.2 million to $2.2 billion worth of bitcoin.  All of Mt.Gox's bitcoin has now effectively been moved to a single bitcoin wallet, Bitinfocharts data shows.  This is the first movement of assets from Mt. Gox's cold wallets in over five years and is likely a part of a plan to distribute the assets back to creditors before October 31, 2024.  All coins have been transferred to a new address ‚Äú1JbezDVd9VsK9o1Ga9UqLydeuEvhKLAPs6,‚Äù CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno said in an X post.

Bitcoin Regains $70,000 As Traders‚Äô Paper Profits Collapse To 3%","The world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has been consolidating over the past week, trading between $67,000 and $70,000 after experiencing a brief 20% price correction that sent it as low as $56,400 in early May. This consolidation period comes as inflows into the US spot Bitcoin ETF market have reignited, and selling pressure appears to have cooled off, both in the ETF market and among Bitcoin investors more broadly. Bitcoin Selling Pressure Fades According to Julio Moreno, head of research at on-chain market analytics firm CryptoQuant, the current Bitcoin price level of $70,000 differs from when it last reached that mark in March. Moreno notes that traders are now exerting much lower selling pressure, as unrealized profits are only around 3%, compared to 69% in early March. This suggests that much of the ‚Äúheavy selling‚Äù has been exhausted, as seen in the chart below. Related Reading: DeFiance Capital Foresees ETH Soaring To $4,500 Pre-Ethereum ETF Trading Santiment data also shows that Bitcoin has once again eclipsed a $70,000 market capitalization, even as the US stock market took a hiatus for the Memorial Day holiday. Market intelligence platform Santiment sees this as an encouraging sign, as it demonstrates BTC‚Äôs ability to perform positively on days when it is not closely correlated with the primary stock market, which has been the case for much of 2022. Final Pre-Breakout Consolidation Phase Despite this positive momentum, crypto analyst Rekt Capital has noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs latest weekly candle closed below the range high resistance of its ongoing ‚Äúre-accumulation‚Äù phase, which spans roughly $60,000 to $70,000. This likely sentences the leading cryptocurrency to further consolidation within this range, aligned with Rekt Capital‚Äôs thesis that two phases remain in the current bull cycle: the post-halving re-accumulation phase and the ‚Äúparabolic rally phase.‚Äù Historically, Bitcoin has tended to consolidate around all-time highs before embarking on the most illustrative stretch of its bull cycles. According to the analyst, Bitcoin has indeed been consolidating at these highs for quite some time now, especially by the standards of previous cycles. While there is still room for further sideways trading at these elevated price levels, the time remaining in this phase is slowly running out. This leads to the belief that the long-awaited post-Halving rally, coupled with renewed investor sentiment, is poised to take the largest cryptocurrency on the market to even higher levels than the current $73,700 reached in mid-March.

According to crypto analyst Jelle, Ethereum has recently emerged from a bearish pattern particularly breaking out from the ‚Äúfalling wedge‚Äù and flipping key resistance into support zones. Jelle reveals that Ethereum is currently pushing for the $4,000 mark which makes the possibility of reaching new heights seems more tangible. This movement marks a significant turnaround from previous trends, setting the stage for potentially record-breaking price levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Turn: Analyst Highlight Positive Bias In ETH Options Across All Expiries The Bullish Shift: Ethereum Breakout from a Falling Wedge Explained Jelle‚Äôs recent observations come during a period of strong performance for Ethereum, with the cryptocurrency showing a 30% increase in value over the past week alone. Ethereum stands at $3,951 at the time of writing, having climbed an additional 2.5% in just 24 hours. This notable uptrend underscores the growing investor confidence and market momentum that could drive Ethereum‚Äôs value to new records. Notably, a falling wedge pattern in technical analysis is a signal that often precedes a bullish market reversal. Characterized by converging trend lines that meet at a downward slope, this pattern typically concludes with a breakout to the upside as buying pressure overcomes selling momentum. $ETH broke out from the falling wedge, then flipped key areas into support & now pushes for $4,000. New highs, and new all-time highs are next. Higher. pic.twitter.com/pjrk8X2FYA ‚Äî Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) May 27, 2024 Ethereum‚Äôs recent breakout from this pattern signifies a potential reversal of its prior downtrend and¬†transforms previous resistance levels into new supports, laying a foundational bullish sentiment. This technical progression is critical as it indicates a shift from bearish to bullish sentiment, suggesting that Ethereum might recover from its previous lows and embark on a sustained upward trajectory. Analysts like Jelle see this as a precursor to more aggressive buying behavior, potentially propelling the asset toward unprecedented price levels. Broader Market Sentiments And Predictions The positive outlook for Ethereum isn‚Äôt isolated. Notable crypto analyst Defi Mochi predicts that the ETH price could soar to between $9,500 and $12,000. According to Mochi, this projection is based on a combination of factors, including increasing political support for cryptocurrencies and the fact that Bitcoin has yet to reclaim its all-time high. With that said my realistic target for $ETH is approximately in the $9.5k to $12k range.

XRP Price Holds Support In the past few sessions, XRP price traded in a positive zone like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the bears were active near the $0.540 and $0.5420 resistance levels. The recent high was formed at $0.5405 and the price is now correcting gains in a range. There was a move below the $0.5340 support zone and the price spiked below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5234 swing low to the $0.5405 high. However, the bulls are active near the $0.530 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5234 swing low to the $0.5405 high. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $0.5265 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair is now trading near $0.5320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $0.5365 level. The first key resistance is near $0.5420. A close above the $0.5420 resistance zone could send the price higher. The next key resistance is near $0.5450. If there is a close above the $0.5450 resistance level, there could be a steady increase toward the $0.5550 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5720 resistance. More Downsides? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5420 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5265 level and the trend line. The next major support is at $0.520. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.520 level, the price might gain bearish momentum. In the stated case, the price could decline and retest the $0.5120 support in the near term.

Injective Is Forming A TD Sequential Buy Signal On Its Weekly Chart In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential signal that has formed in the weekly price of Injective recently. The TD Sequential refers to an indicator in technical analysis (TA) generally used for spotting potential points of reversal in any asset‚Äôs price. This indicator involves two phases: setup and countdown. In the first of this setup, candles of the same polarity (green/red) are counted up to nine. Once the nine candles are in, the price may have reached a turnaround point. Related Reading: Shiba Inu One Of The Most-Traded Tokens By Whales, Data Shows Naturally, the TD Sequential would suggest a probable bottom in the asset if the candles leading up to the setup‚Äôs completion were red. Similarly, the indicator would signal selling if the phase finished with an uptrend. After the setup is done, the countdown phase begins. During this second phase, candles of the same type are again counted, this time till thirteen. After the thirteenth candle of the same polarity, the price may be assumed to have encountered another likely top or bottom. According to Martinez, a TD Sequential signal of the former type has been completed for the Injective‚Äôs weekly price. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that reveals this recent signal in cryptocurrency. As the graph shows, Injective has finished a TD Sequential setup with a downtrend, suggesting that the asset may have reached a point of reversal towards the upside. In the chart, the analyst has highlighted what happened the last two times the weekly price of the cryptocurrency encountered this signal. The first of these signals appeared to have preceded a rally of over 700%, while the other resulted in a surge of almost 556%. Thus, given this bullish precedence, it‚Äôs possible that the latest TD Sequential buy signal could also lead to another run of sharp bullish momentum for the asset‚Äôs price. Related Reading: Analyst Says ‚ÄúOnly A Matter Of Time‚Äù Before Bitcoin Flies Past ATH However, it should be noted that the TD Sequential hasn‚Äôt always been completely reliable for the coin. As is visible in the graph, the indicator flagged a sell signal partway through the second of the rallies above. As such, it remains to be seen how the Injective price develops from here on out and whether the TD Sequential buy signal will have an immediate bullish effect, just like it did the last two times. INJ Price The Injective has been stuck in consolidation over the past month. Its price is currently trading around $26, right in the middle of the range.

Related Reading: Bollinger Bands Inventor Foresees Bitcoin Pullback: Key Levels To Watch Strategic Buying Opportunities For Bitcoin Van de Poppe suggests specific price marks that could represent advantageous buying opportunities for Bitcoin.

Monitoring these price levels could be key to capitalizing on potential market lows. In addition to pinpointing optimal buying zones, Van de Poppe advocates adopting a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy during this period. #Bitcoin is consolidating, and it‚Äôs within the range. Probably that consolidation will be taking place for a longer period and I suspect we might see $61-63K even. Rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum causing a longer sideways period. It‚Äôs fine.

This strategy is particularly beneficial in mitigating the risks associated with BTC prices‚Äô high volatility. It allows¬†traders to build positions without the pressure of timing the market perfectly. Comparative Analysis And Future Outlook While van de Poppe focuses on immediate strategies for navigating the current Bitcoin climate, other analysts, like PlanB,¬†look at broader market indicators to forecast future movements.

However, it seems experts do not expect the altcoin to continue its bullish trend, with one crypto analyst predicting that the XRP price is headed for a massive crash. XRP Price On The Verge Of An 80% Crash A crypto analyst who goes by the moniker Without Worries on the TradingView website has shared a concerning development for the XRP price. This analysis ,which focuses on the altcoin‚Äôs performance over the last two years, suggests that the price is more likely to crash from here than continue its climb. Related Reading: Terra LUNA‚Äôs LUNC Set To Jump 13x, Analyst Reveals The Drivers According to the crypto analyst, the XRP price had been trading inside an uptrend channel for the last two years. Mostly, this channel has held up, allowing the cryptocurrency to hold onto its bullish trend. However, the analyst explains that this uptrend channel support has now failed, and with the confirmation complete, it points to a price reversal for the altcoin. Furthermore, the crypto analyst points out that this channel support failure came after a could top in the price after the coin broke market structure back in April 2022. Given this, he expects the price to reverse from here and crash to levels not seen since 2020. The target for this crash sits at the $0.1, according to the analyst. If this happens, it would mean an over 80% crash from the current value of the token, which sits at around $0.5, at the time of this writing. Could The Uptrend Continue From Here? Like with any analysis, the crypto analyst explains that there is a scenario in which the XRP price could continue its present uptrend. In such a case, the price would have to continue trading inside the channel and hold its support at this level. Related Reading: Why Did CORE Price Surge 20% While The Crypto Market Dumped? However, he explains that the price action has already exited the channel. Now, the point to hold becomes the $0.3 level. As long as this holds, then the uptrend would continue. ‚Äúthat support not confirm, 10 cents is next,‚Äù the analyst explains. The analyst believes it is possible that the price action does enter the channel and continue to uptrend. However, he points out that this is not probable, given that there is already confirmation of the price failing to hold support. Nevertheless, at the time of writing, the XRP price is still holding above $0.52 with 1.33% losses in the last day.
