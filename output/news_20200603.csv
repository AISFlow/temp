Peirce, who has been one of the most prominent crypto advocates among the U.S.'s regulatory agencies, took office in January 2018 after U.S. President Donald Trump nominated her to finish the last two years of a five-year-term. Without the renomination, her term would have expired on Friday.      The new term would see her serving through 2025, said Bloomberg Law, which first reported the move.      In recent months, the regulator has proposed a safe harbor for crypto startups looking to issue tokens, as a way of allowing these companies to raise funds and begin operations without fear of running afoul of U.S. securities laws. Peirce asked for the general public to provide feedback on the proposal after publishing it.      Peirce has been dubbed ""Crypto Mom"" after she publicly dissented on the SEC's decision to reject a bitcoin exchange-traded fund application filed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.      Peirce declined to comment, but the regulator previously told CoinDesk she did not feel as though her work at the agency was finished.      “I certainly don’t feel done with what I want to do at the SEC.

42404662,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjvYb,1591220041,Latest Bitcoin Core Code Release Protects Against Nation-State Attacks,"The Takeaway:    The 20th iteration of Bitcoin Core, the open source software powering the Bitcoin blockchain, was released Wednesday.  Experimental software called “Asmap” was included to protect against a theoretical “Erebus” attack.  An Erebus attack allows nation-states and/or large internet providers such as Amazon Web Services to spy, double-spend or censor bitcoin transactions.  The patch would help thwart an attack but is not a conclusive fix.    Bitcoin Core released a new software update Wednesday, Bitcoin Core 0.20.0. Notably, the release includes experimental software to hedge against attacks from players the size of nation-states, which could effectively fracture the Bitcoin network.      Called “Asmap,” this new configuration protects the peer-to-peer architecture of bitcoin nodes by mapping connections to Tier 1 or larger Tier 2 Autonomous Systems (AS) – internet operators capable of connecting to multiple networks with defined routing plans such as Amazon Web Services or states – and then “limiting the connections made to any single [AS].”      In essence, the so-called “Erebus” attack allows an AS to censor large swaths of the Bitcoin network by limiting and then spoofing peer-to-peer (P2P) connections. Failure to address the flaw could lead to highly undesirable consequences for Bitcoin such as a major mining pool or exchange being cut off from the rest of the network.      An Erebus attack was first hypothesized by researchers at the National University of Singapore (NUS) – Muoi Tran, Inho Choi, Gi Jun Moon, Anh V. Vu and Min Suk Kang – who co-authored a 2019 paper detailing the attack.      The kicker? It’s entirely undetectable until too late.    Attack architecture    Erebus falls under the general “man-in-middle” attack scheme made possible through the P2P nature of bitcoin. Greek for “shadow,” Erebus is itself a derivative of the “Eclipse” attack first described in 2015.      As theorized, the malicious actor will try and connect to as many nodes as possible around one node that the attacker wishes to isolate (an exchange’s node, for example). The malicious node can begin to influence the victim node by connecting to its peers. The end goal is to make the victim node’s eight external connections pass through the malicious party.      Once accomplished, the victim is isolated from the rest of the network. The malicious actor can decide what transactions and information are sent to the victim; this information can be completely different from the rest of the network and could even lead to a chain split or censorship.      “Our attack is feasible not because of any newly discovered bugs in the Bitcoin core implementation but the fundamental topological advantage of being a network adversary,” the NUS academics wrote in 2019. “That is, our EREBUS adversary AS, as a stable man-in-the-middle network, can utilize a large number of network addresses reliably over an extended period of time. Moreover, an AS can target specific nodes such as mining pools or crypto exchanges.”      If an exchange or mining pool’s node was shadow attacked, an AS could effectively cut off the entity from connecting to the network. An Erebus styled attack would be even more devastating given the bitcoin mining industry’s continued centralization into mining pools.      Read more: No, Concentration Among Miners Isn’t Going to Break Bitcoin      For bitcoin, 10,000 nodes are currently susceptible, with the academics estimating a five- to six-week attack period needed to successfully pull off the stunt. Bitcoin has a lower bound of 11,000 listening nodes with an upper bound 100,000 non-listening or “private” nodes, according to bitcoin core contributor Luke Dashjr.      As of Wednesday, a solution to the attack is now embedded in the 20th edition of Bitcoin’s code, making the fledgling monetary system even more censorship-resistant.    Erebus and the internet    The Erebus attack is in no way the fault of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin. It’s just how the internet evolved.      “We are solving a problem of not your internet provider, but some internet provider in the world screwing you because that’s much more dangerous,” said Chaincode Labs researcher and Bitcoin Core contributor Gleb Naumenko.      Like a hub and spoke, nation-states and large ISPs control access to the internet. Networks further break down into individual IP addresses like the phone you’re probably reading this on.      Bitcoin nodes operate in the same manner with each node having its own IP address, unless hidden via Tor or another obfuscation method. Once a node decides to go through the malicious node, the AS can decide how that node connects to the rest of the network for that particular connection.      When a bitcoin node connects to the network, it typically makes eight outbound connections meaning it will broadcast a transaction to eight other bitcoin nodes. Slowly but surely, every node in the Bitcoin network confirms and writes down a transaction made by another node, if valid. In Erebus, if the AS is successful in grabbing all of eight of the node’s external connections, the node serves at the whim of the AS.      The attack comes in two parts: reconnaissance and execution.      First, the AS maps out IP addresses of nodes within the network, noting where they can be found and what peers they connect to. Then the AS slowly begins to influence the peers it has surveyed. In other words, the malicious actor is working to exclusively accept connections from as many nodes in their community as possible.      The number of connections depends on the attacker’s motivations: censoring individual transactions, blocking off-chain transactions (such as on the Lightning Network) from occurring, selfishly mining a split chain of the network to get a larger percentage of block rewards or even launching a 51 percent attack to double-spend bitcoins.      The more nodes a malicious attacker exclusively controls, the more damage they can do to the network. In fact, with enough connections, they can effectively shut down bitcoin by controlling large swaths of the bitcoin network, said the NUS team.      “A powerful adversary, such as a nation-state attacker, may even aim to disrupt a large portion of the underlying peer-to-peer network of a cryptocurrency. At a small scale, the adversary can arbitrarily censor the transactions from the victim,” the academics write.    Stealth mode    Unlike the Eclipse attack, Erebus is stealth.      “So the difference is, what they are doing is it’s not detectable – there really is no evidence. It looks like regular behavior,” Naumenko said about an AS fomenting the attack.      The internet is made up of different data levels. Some layers reveal information, some don’t and some contain too much information to keep track of.      In Eclipse, an attacker uses information from the internet protocol layer while Erebus uses information on the bitcoin protocol layer. Eclipse’s route “immediately reveals” the identity of the attacker, the academics said. Conversely, Erebus does not, making it impossible to detect until an attack is underway.      While the threat remains alive as long as the current internet stack exists as it does, there remain options for thwarting a would-be attacker. Wednesday’s Updates were led by Blockstream co-founder and engineer Pieter Wuille and Chaincode’s Naumenko.      The fix? A Zelda-esque mini-map of the different nation-states and ISPs typical internet routing paths. Nodes can then choose peer connections based on the map with the intention of connecting to multiple bodies rather than one AS.      Read more: Where to Find Bitcoin’s Rising Stars      The solution from the Bitcoin Core team makes the attack unlikely by adding further obstacles to isolating nodes from the rest of the network, but may not provide a permanent fix.      “This option is experimental and subject to removal or breaking changes in future releases,” Bitcoin Core contributor Wladimir J. van der Laan said Wednesday in a developer’s email.      Naumenko said they decided to tackle the issue due to its clear danger to the network. The attack was also novel, spiking his personal interest.      It’s not just bitcoin, though. As Naumenko noted, almost all cryptos are threatened by an Erebus attack. The NUS paper itself cites dash (DASH), litecoin (LTC) and zcash (ZEC) as examples of other coins at risk of similar attacks.      “It’s a fundamental problem and the protocols are very similar. It’s systemic. It’s not some bug where you forgot to update the variable,” Chaincode’s Naumenko said. “It’s peer-to-peer architecture and [part of] all the systems.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/03/latest-bitcoin-core-code-release-protects-against-nation-state-attacks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6517d0f78b52a3830df797c02e5b3b0755750b9-1500x1073.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404655,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjvPk,1591218574,Argo's Mining Revenue Dips After Bitcoin's Halving,"London-listed Argo reported a dip in May revenue, possibly as a result of the bitcoin halving event.      Per the mining firm's monthly operational update, monthly mining margins – revenue minus operating costs – was roughly 34% in May, down from 39% in April. Overall, the company mined 252 bitcoin (~$2.4 million at press time), down from 319 bitcoin (~$3 million) the month before.      This slight dip in revenue comes straight after the bitcoin halving – which took block rewards down from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC last month. Argo says it was able to mitigate potential disruptions from the halving by investing in ""state-of-the-art"" mining rigs.      Argo, which listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in 2018, currently operates 18,000 mining rigs with a combined total hashpower of 730 Petahash – a 244% increase since the end of 2019.

In a statement, CEO Peter Wall said Argo anticipated Bitcoin's mining difficulty to drop between 4% to 6% at the next adjustment, expected later this week. ""This change is expected to result in improvements to our overall mining margins,"" he said.

Global equities    After the cryptocurrency excitement over the past few days, stock markets across the globe are taking center stage, as all major indices are doing well.      Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed its day up 1.6%, led by increased demand in the automotive sector within Asia.

Such a situation would only make bitcoin’s recent performance look even better comparatively. Although not exactly a smooth ride, since the start of May, bitcoin is up over 14%, outperforming all the major stock indices.

42404661,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjvWd,1591214791,Nonprofit Energy Consortium Trials Blockchain Management for Wastewater Tracking,"The Offshore Operators Committee, a nonprofit organization focused on offshore energy, has found a blockchain management system reduces costs and time for transporting wastewater.      The OOC's Oil and Gas Blockchain Consortium has completed its first pilot of a produced water haulage management system using blockchain technology. The pilot, the first industry-wide use of a blockchain-native network for produced water haulage, essentially tried to streamline the process of transporting wastewater byproducts collected during the extraction of oil and natural gas, referred to as produced water.      The pilot automatically measured volume and generated invoices during the transportation process.      Developed in partnership with Data Gumbo, a blockchain software company based in Houston, Texas, the pilot found the new tools reduced the amount of time it takes to transport produced water. The process also required less human intervention and reduced costs, the consortium said.      Water logistics and transportation firm Nuverra Environmental Solutions, and an unnamed midstream disposal company worked on the pilot, which was used across five oil and gas wells in the Bakken field in North Dakota.      See also: Tradeshift Proposes Plan to Protect Denmark’s Supply Chains From COVID-19 Crisis      The OOC Oil and Gas Blockchain Consortium comprises 10 big-name oil and gas member companies, including Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Equinor, ExxonMobil, Hess, Marathon, Noble Energy, Pioneer Natural Resources, Repsol and Shell.      The consortium set out to study and define blockchain use cases across the industry value chain in order to solve common pain points. The initial pilot results saw a reduction in the process workflow from 90-120 days down to between one and seven days, and reduced 16 steps to seven that require no manual intervention.      In addition, 85% of all volume measurements are now automatically validated against the data provided by the various parties involved, and this figure could climb close to 100%, the release said.      Validations during the process automatically triggered the execution of related invoice transactions which reduced financial risk by giving peace of mind that payments matched up with certain field activity.      See also: Amazon Patents Blockchain-Based Product Authenticator      “The results of this pilot prove that non-manned volume validations can trigger automated payments to vendors, and showcase the opportunities that exist for blockchain to reduce costs, increase efficiency, provide transparency and eliminate disputes in the oil and gas industry,” chairman of the OOC Oil and Gas Blockchain Consortium, Rebecca Hofmann said.      The consortium also said that 25%-35% of resources can be reallocated, in comparison to its current business model for the operator and trucking company, thanks to DLT's inherent benefits.      “This is just the tip of the iceberg for the potential of blockchain in our industry,” Hofmann added.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | TECHNOLOGY,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/03/nonprofit-energy-consortium-trials-blockchain-management-for-wastewater-tracking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43c42a19f4e23c6d63446aeb47ee12a79be889b9-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It sought to become the crypto industry’s equivalent of Crunchbase and the US Security and Exchange Commission’s EDGAR database, which contains company registration statements and reports among other documents, all of which are publicly available.  In late 2018, Messari launched a disclosure registry for token projects to publicly share information on things like token supply, token design, treasury management, team members, official communications channels and, if available, any audits of the technology. In 2019, the registry had 35 participating projects including Blockstack, Maker, polymath, zcash, and zilliqa.  Today, Messari’s suite of tools includes Messari Pro and Enterprise, Messari Governor, and Messari Hub.  The company’s two subscription-based plans - Messari Pro and Messari Enterprise – provide quantitative and qualitative solutions. Pro subscribers can access research reports covering DeFi, smart contracts, Web3, NFTs, and more. It also allows subscribers to unlock additional metrics and functionalities on the screener, charts, and watchlist tools.  The Messari Enterprise plan offers all of the features of the Pro plan, as well as exclusive market intelligence features, or Intel, which allows retail investors and institutions alike to track all major events, changes, and protocol decisions across 100+ assets.  Messari Hub is an evolution of the company’s original disclosure registry which allowed token projects to publicly share information to readers. Today, Hub allows crypto organizations including funds, infrastructure providers, protocols, and projects to fund asset-specific research and technical deep dives for broad distribution.  Messari Governor facilitates voting participation through many governance frameworks for protocols and communities including Uniswap, SushiSwap, Compound, OlympusDAO and many more. Through the platform, users have access to proposal trackers and pages ahead of future offerings including governance participant profiles, treasury trackers, governance events calendar, and many more options.

In 2016, it patented technology intended to deanonymize bitcoin wallets and transactions.  Established in 2011 by Peter Vessness and Mike Koss, Coinlab aimed to provide Mt.Gox, the largest bitcoin exchange at the time, with financial and investment partnerships in the US. It received venture capital funding from Roger Ver, Barry Silbert, and Tim Draper.  In 2013, Coinlab sued Mt.Gox for $75 million for breach of contract. Coinlab alleged that Mt.Gox continued to market to North American customers and did not provide Coinlab with the data and service access it needed to fulfill the terms of the agreement. Later in 2013, Mt.Gox countersued Coinlab for not being able to lawfully operate as its partner in the US.  Without reaching a settlement, Mt.Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014 shortly after it was revealed that near 850,000 bitcoins had been stolen from its wallets. In April of 2014, Mt. Gox filed for liquidation, abandoning plans of ‘civil rehabilitation.’  In 2017, several Mt.Gox creditors filed a petition for the commencement of civil rehabilitation proceedings against Mt. Gox. with the Tokyo District Court. A judge approved the petition in 2018 and stayed the previously ongoing bankruptcy proceedings  When Mt. Gox first filed for bankruptcy, creditors filed claims as to how much they should receive in recompense. Coinlab originally claimed $75 million, the amount they had previously sued Mt. Gox for in 2013 for breach of contract. However, when civil rehabilitation proceedings commenced, creditors had to refile their claims. All other creditors refiled for their original claims except Coinlab, which reportedly increased its claim from $75 million to $16 billion. Creditors will be reportedly unable to vote on a civil rehabilitation plan until Coinlab’s claim is assessed by a bankruptcy judge, delaying the proceedings indefinitely.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Matthew Kimmell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/coinlab,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b689ab1a212905a4a844a15c953b20764cc42bca-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BitInstant’s volume grew rapidly in 2013 due to a bitcoin price hike, in which it increased from approximately $100 to just above $1000. During this period, BitInstant underwent phases of temporary shutdown and maintenance, upgrades, and new hires.  In May 2013, Winklevoss Capital invested $1.5 million in BitInstant, which was intended to fund the scaling of its personnel and product.  On July 8th, 2013 several BitInstant customers filed a class action lawsuit against the exchange, claiming that it had falsely represented its services. The plaintiffs specifically stated that the exchange made false claims about the speed of its services and the refunding of fees. BitInstant received a subpoena from the NY Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) during the same week of the filing. NYDFS sought information about the exchange’s operations and the consumer protections it had in place.  In January 2014, Shrem was arrested for allegedly attempting to launder and sell more than $1 million worth of bitcoin to users of darknet market Silk Road with associate Robert Faiella, also known as 'BTCKing.' The Manhattan US Attorney charged both men with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiring to commit money laundering. Shrem was also “charged with willfully failing to file any suspicious activity report regarding Faiella’s illegal transactions through [BitInstant], in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act.” Both men entered into plea bargains and Shrem was sentenced to two years in prison, while Faiella was sentenced to four years in prison. The plea bargains also stipulated that Shrem and Faiella each forfeit $950,000 to the government.  Gareth Nelson, Bitinstant’s founding partner, was not charged or accused of wrongdoing.

42404663,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjvZa,1591205959,Miners Are Selling More of Their Bitcoin. That May Actually Be Bullish,"Despite Tuesday’s sudden price decline, miner flows suggest the bitcoin market remains strong.      The biggest cryptocurrency by market value fell 8% from $10,137 to $9,298 in less than five minutes during Tuesday's U.S. trading hours, dashing hopes for a continued upward move.      The price drop, however, has not deterred miners from running down their inventory.      According to data source ByteTree, miners have sold 920 BTC and generated 844 BTC in the past 24 hours, pushing their inventory down by 76 BTC and keeping the miners' rolling inventory (MRI) figure above 100%.      “Miners HODL [hold] when the market is weak, not because they are bullish, but because the market can’t take it. When they can sell, it is an indication that the market is well supported,” said ByteTree founder and Chairman Charlie Morris, who added that the MRI is currently high.      Morris’ theory contradicts popular belief that miners, being sellers, would want to sell high and hoard their bitcoin when prices are expected to rise.      However, the conventional wisdom could be challenged because miners mainly operate on cash, meaning they need to liquidate their holdings almost daily to fund the cost of mining. This is evident from the fact that miners account for the highest percentage of total bitcoin flowing into exchanges.      And while they have the biggest influence on prices, gyrations in price affect mining profitability. A sustained price drop often crowds out small and inefficient miners from the market.      Miners, therefore, would want to sell less in a market lacking the strength to absorb their offers. On the contrary, they would be inclined to sell more when the upward momentum is strong.      Hence, it could be said that the increased supply seen in the past 24 hours is a sign of miner confidence in a broader bull market, although some observers may argue that 24-hour changes are too small to draw valid conclusions.      However, inventory has declined over the past week amid the price rise.      Bitcoin is currently up 6% on a week-on-week basis despite miners running down inventory by 504 BTC. Similarly, miners have sold more than what they generated throughout the uptrend from the March low of $3,867 to recent highs near $10,400.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $9,580, representing a 0.5% gain on the day. Analysts expect deeper declines in the near term.

Coinbase did not respond to a request for comment.      Future deployments will gradually move control of Matic over to the community.      One of the many projects seeking to provide workarounds for ethereum’s scaling woes, Matic uses Plasma framework-based side chains and a proof-of-stake model to speed up dapp performance at “1/100th” of the ethereum gas cost, according to the announcement.      Those Plasma roots come via CEO Jaynti Kanani, an erstwhile Plasma contributor who started Matic with Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun in October 2017.      Matic has since grown to a team of 25 full-time contributors working out of Bangalore, the ""Silicon Valley"" of India.    Adding firepower    “What we are building actually provides a lot of firepower to ethereum,” said Chandresh Aharwar, operations chief.      Ethereum is also trying to shore up its problems by deploying Eth 2.0. At last check, founder Vitalik Buterin said the long awaited and perennially delayed network upgrade is launching in Q3 2020.      Aharwar is less optimistic. He told CoinDesk that Eth 2.0 project insiders “know” it's not on schedule. “Eth 2.0 for applications is not going to be there for at least 1.5 or 2 years,'' he said, calling that an “aggressive” timeline.      In the meantime, Matic is trying to position its sidechain for dapps that might otherwise choose to base on EOS or TRON for performance gains. “Now they get that scame scalability on ethereum,” Aharwar said.      The Matic team began building toward mainnet launch two and a half years ago. Based in Bangalore, India, it has close ties to the country’s developer community through hackathons, Aharwar said. At least 6 new core developers joined in the past few months.      That acceleration comes as the wider Indian startup community faces a possibly catastrophic capital drought. TechCrunch reported that a mere 30% have enough cash to get through the next three months, and up to 40% were either pausing business or shuttering from COVID-19.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MATIC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/03/matic-launches-mainnet-aiming-to-bring-more-firepower-to-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/158923b54401730b30c7bcb1a54371288a47e10b-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404667,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjvbY,1591184020,First Mover: ECB Stimulus May Offer Market Hope After Bitcoin Fails (Again) to Break $10K,"As bitcoin struggles to break out of the range it's largely been stuck in for more than a month, some investors are looking ahead to Thursday's European Central Bank meeting for fresh monetary stimulus that might underscore the cryptocurrency's potential as an inflation hedge.      Prices for bitcoin shot up 8% on Monday to a three-month high around $10,200, then quickly reversed on Tuesday, falling back to about $9,500. CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey reported the price action may have been exacerbated by liquidations of derivatives trades on the Seychelles-based exchange BitMEX.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      The round-trip disappointed some bulls who had speculated that a break above $10,000 might kindle a longer-term price surge.      ""There is a longstanding resistance level just below the $10,400 mark, which has proved to be a tough hurdle several times over the last nine months,"" eToro markets analyst Simon Peters wrote Tuesday in an email.      The ECB, led by Christine Lagarde, could decide Thursday to expand its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, or PEPP, by about €500 billion ($560 billion), from an initial target of €750 billion set in March, economists with the U.K. bank Barclays predict.      According to the Financial Times, the program would otherwise run out of firepower by October.      “If we judge that further stimulus is needed, the ECB will be ready to expand any of its tools in order to achieve its price stability objective,” Isabel Schnabel, a member of the ECB’s executive board, said last week in an interview with the FT.      The PEPP, like the Fed's quantitative easing programs, is designed to support markets – and inject fresh money into the financial system – through purchases of government bonds and other assets.      Quantitative easing, or QE, was initially an experimental and controversial monetary practice, but over the past decade has become a mainstay of major central banks in lieu of further interest-rate cuts. And with the coronavirus pandemic shuttering economic activity earlier this year, central banks quickly resorted to new rounds of QE, in addition to emergency lending programs.      According to Bank of America, total assets on the balance sheets of six major central banks, including the ECB and the Federal Reserve, have surged to about $20 trillion, from about $15 trillion in 2019. The amount is forecast to reach almost $25 trillion by 2021.      Among crypto traders, a prominent investment thesis is that these massive money injections could eventually stoke inflation, which could be good for the cryptocurrency, since its supply is capped at a maximum of 21 million units.      ""This repeated and literally unlimited use of fiscal and monetary expansion will dramatically push up the quantity of fiat money required to buy non-quantitatively-easible things, like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,"" Dan Morehead, CEO and co-chief investment officer of the digital-asset-focused investment firm Pantera Capital, wrote last week in a monthly letter.      While inflation is currently muted, due to lagging economic demand, the bet is that the price dynamic could change as countries across Europe and many U.S. states move to relax lockdown restrictions, allowing non-essential businesses like retail stores, bars and restaurants to reopen.      Pedro Febrrrero, an analyst at the cryptocurrency and foreign exchange research house Quantum Economics, wrote in an article last month that bitcoin, along with other “hard currencies” like gold and precious metals, was likely to benefit considerably from continuing QE.      ""QE will eventually push up BTC’s price,"" he wrote. As government money ""becomes extremely abundant, assets with strong network effects and limited quantities tend to rise in price.”      Bitcoin, launched in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, has only ever existed in the era of cheap money, and QE doesn't look to end anytime soon.      So an additional commitment by the ECB this week could reinforce the bet that as the prospect of inflation grows, more investors will eventually turn to bitcoin.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    Trend: Having trapped bulls on the wrong side of the market with a rapid $800 decline during Tuesday's U.S. trading hours, bitcoin is now consolidating around $9,590.      ""Longs were overzealous at the top,"" tweeted popular analyst @TheCryptoDog in response to the violent pullback from $10,130 to $8,300. Indeed, most analysts and investors were expecting Monday's pennant breakout to power the cryptocurrency on to stronger gains. It seems the bulls paid little attention to trading volumes, which were calling for caution.      ""Breakouts seen in bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies were just spikes that lasted less than an hour, preceded and especially not followed by sustained volume, confirming that they were just triggered by stop-losses without much conviction behind them,"" said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer at ExoAlpha, a Paris-based asset management firm.      Tuesday's drop was accompanied by a surge in selling volume (red bars on the chart above) and further losses may be seen in the short-term.      Supporting the case for deeper declines is the failed pennant breakout seen on the daily chart. Analysts consider failed breakouts as powerful signals of bearish reversals. On the downside, key support is located at $8,630 (May 25 low), which if breached, would violate the bullish higher-highs setup.      A sustained move back above $10,000 is needed to restore the uptrend. That may be a tough task, as bitcoin has failed multiple times in the last 12 months to establish a firm foothold above $10,000.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Paddy Baker, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/03/first-mover-ecb-stimulus-may-offer-market-hope-after-bitcoin-fails-again-to-break-10k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41f4a171ad9cb4797654a49bc0b5291d32210b8e-1500x1024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a second round of funding later that year, BlockFi secured $52.2 million in a round led by Galaxy Digital.  In January 2018, BlockFi launched its first product: USD loans backed by cryptocurrency to target cryptocurrency holders and enables them to offer their bitcoin, ether or litecoin assets as collateral for a loan.  BlockFi aims to provide loans at a 4.5% interest rate, where customers can still gain interest from their holdings and investments. If the price of their crypto collateral goes down by 50% from the time of the initiation of the loan, customers will be asked to either pay down their loan amount of increase their collateral.  In 2019, BlockFi launched its second major product to retail customers, a crypto-funded interest account. With this account, customers deposit bitcoin, ether or litecoin with the company for the assets to accumulate cumulative interest every month. BlockFi has previously advertized 6.2% annual interest, compounded monthly.  As of 2019, BlockFi’s loans are available in 47 states in the U.S, and the interest accounts are available to anyone worldwide, except for 3 states as well as in any country sanctioned by the U.S., the U.K. or EU.

42421859,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwlXZ,1591179658,Ripple Labs,"Originally OpenCoin Inc, Ripple Labs is the San Francisco company behind the XRP ledger and Ripple payments network. Founded in 2012 by Chris Larsen, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto, it is currently led by CEO Brad Garlinghouse.  Ripple Labs can trace its origins back to Ripplepay, a peer-to-peer payment network created in 2004 by Ryan Fugger. Fugger had wanted a network that connected individuals and allowed them to extend credit and exchange debt through the people they knew in the network. In 2012, McCaleb and Larsen, who had been working on their own digital currency project, contacted Fugger, who subsequently entrusted the project to them.  Ripple aims to improve cross-border payments through its distributed ledger and the global banking system by making transfers cheaper and more efficient. The company has multiple products: xCurrent is software banks can use for cross-border payments; xRapid helps financial institutions manage liquidity costs; and xVia, is a user interface to make xCurrent and xRapid easier to use.  The XRP token, the ledger’s native digital asset, is mainly used on xRapid to provide liquidity in cross-border payments that involve illiquid trading pairs.  The network of financial institutions using all of Ripple’s products is called RippleNet, and includes well over 100 established financial institutions, such as Santander, American Express, MoneyGram, and PNC Bank.  Ripple Labs is privately funded by investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures, and Accenture. It created 100 billion total XRP when the project launched: 80 billion went to Ripple Labs and 20 billion was allocated to the founders as ""compensation"" for the risk associated with setting the project up.  Ripple Labs has gradually released its XRP holdings into general circulation, to improve liquidity. It was down to roughly 55 billion tokens by December 2017. Most of the XRP is now held in an escrow account, and the company puts a billion tokens up for sale every month. The escrow account held approximately 48.9 billion tokens at the start of 2020.  Leaving Ripple in 2014, McCaleb took to an XRP Talk forum to announce he planned to sell his 9 billion XRP tokens. His announcement corresponded with a 40% drop in XRP’s price overnight.  Ripple Labs subsequently reached an agreement with McCaleb to prevent him from selling his 9 billion XRP all at once. The terms of the plan gave McCaleb the option to sell $10,000 worth of tokens a week for the first year and $20,000 a week the second, third, and fourth years.  Ripple Labs has been at the center of several controversies with the law. In 2015, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen) fined the company and its subsidiary, XRP II, $700,000 for failing to register as a money services business (MSB) before selling XRP, in addition to failing to implement appropriate anti-money laundering (AML) procedures. Ripple eventually agreed to pay a $450,000 fine and settle potential criminal charges from the investigation.  In 2018, several lawsuits were filed against Ripple that alleged XRP should have been classified as a security as the company used tokens to fund the Ripple ecosystem. These lawsuits were filed due to investors losing money after XRP’s price drop.  In 2020, Ripple Labs filed a lawsuit against Youtube, claiming the platform had done nothing to stop fake XRP giveaway scams that had resulted in users losing money and caused reputational damage to the company,",NEUTRAL,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | WALLET | XRP,John Metais,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/ripple-labs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af02697829824e89b86c721bf337c5f38ac84c75-1500x913.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That is, until the larger blockchain swaps its consensus algorithm in a network overhaul known as Eth 2.0 – tentatively scheduled for Q3 2020.    The hard fork represents a major departure for Ethereum Classic, which is sticking with Proof-of-Work (PoW) while its sister chain moves to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and sharding.      Read more: Vitalik Buterin Clarifies Remarks on Expected Launch Date of Eth 2.0      In some ways, the PoS versus PoW split mirrors the foundational disagreement that led to the creation of Ethereum Classic. Competing interpretations of an infamous 2016 hack forced a contentious hard fork that splintered one developer camp into two. Since then, Ethereum Classic has largely played catch-up with Ethereum, which boasts the larger developer network.      But now, Ethereum Classic is sticking with the tried and tested, ETC Labs CEO Terry Culver said in an interview.      “We are comfortable with how [PoW] works,” he said. “Over time, we can address its challenges.”      Phoenix itself represents the third hard fork executed on Ethereum Classic in the last calendar year, preceded by Agharta and Atlantis, which also increased interoperability between the two chains. Sunday’s hard fork onboarded Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) from Ethereum’s last hard fork, Istanbul, conducted in December 2019.      Istanbul amended gas constraints, added protections against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and created options for interoperability with equihash blockchains such as Zcash. Of those updates, Ethereum Classic developers were mainly focused on addressing various gas constraints under Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposal (ECIP) 1088.      Read more: Ethereum Classic Successfully Completes ‘Agharta’ Hard Fork      In both Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, gas constraints are fine-tuned from time to time depending on the network’s needs. Denominated in the sub-unit “gwei,” gas is a fee paid to the network for executing a user’s transactions.    Composability    Instead of following in Ethereum’s footsteps, Ethereum Classic will now be a near neighbor.      Interchain composability, Culver said, places the ETC community into a “position to drive innovation.” To that end, ETC Labs is carrying out projects on stateless clients and decentralized storage – “universal challenges everyone is facing,” he added.      Technical updates on the existing Ethereum will continue. Called Eth 1.x, the PoW-based Ethereum chain will roll out non-contentious hard forks – including one late this summer known as “Berlin” – until it bridges with Eth 2.0. That date is years on the horizon, however. Culver said the Ethereum Classic community will likely adopt these measures as needed to retain interoperability.      Read more: Grayscale to Fund Ethereum Classic Developers for 2 More Years      Directionally, Ethereum Classic will act as a base layer within the overarching Ethereum ecosystem itself, similar to the development of modern computing, said ETC Cooperative Executive Director Bob Summerwill.      Ethereum and Ethereum Classic would live next door to one another – and therefore support similar offerings, such as enterprise blockchain tools or decentralized finance (DeFi) dapps – but ETC would offer a tested mechanism to support those applications with PoW.      “You had Unix and then you had Linux and then you had iOS and all of these different families of related operating systems and related kernels,” Summerwill said in an interview. “I think it’s likely that you’re going to have something quite similar on the Ethereum side – that you’re going to have many many Ethereum-flavored solutions compatible to varying degrees.”      In that vein, Summerwill sees the need for an alternative, or many alternatives, to Eth 2.0’s scalability solution centered on PoS and sharding, a database efficiency technique. Those who have been involved in Ethereum the longest know not to put too many “chips” in one basket, he said.      Moreover, Summerwill said most dapps will most likely want to run on a second layer of the Ethereum or Ethereum Classic blockchains. Ethereum Classic can be a home for dapps as long as it can implement scaling techniques such as ZK Rollups or Optimistic Rollups, he said.      “The base layer pattern that we know works is Proof-of-Work. You may not scale up that Layer 1 ever, but maybe that’s fine,” Summerwill said.",NEUTRAL,ETC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETC | ZRX | FORKS,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/03/hard-fork-sets-stage-for-ethereum-classics-second-major-departure-from-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb9a75a18adab0d0f4d3712948a317a94b03fdce-1200x881.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421905,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwmzN,1591177299,Kraken,"Kraken is an American cryptocurrency trading platform founded in 2011 by Jesse Powell. Kraken supports crypto-to-crypto and fiat-to-crypto trades.  Powell started Kraken in the aftermath of the hack of the Mt. Gox exchange, after having helped the now-defunct exchange with its early problems. These shortcomings are what motivated Powell to build a more robust exchange.  Though the company is headquartered in San Francisco, California, Kraken operates worldwide with most of its activity in Europe. In 2013, in an effort to offer Kraken’s European customers regulated crypto trading services, the company partnered with Germany-based Fidor Bank, whose goal was also to bring emerging and innovative markets to its customers.  In 2014, Kraken launched their cryptocurrency trading platform in Japan, but closed this service down in 2018, citing operations costs. In 2015, Kraken announced a partnership with Canadian digital currency risk-management specialist company Vogogo and, as a result, launched its trading platform in Canada.  In 2015, New York State implemented a new regulatory approach to businesses offering services related to cryptocurrencies and digital currencies. These businesses were required to apply for a license, dubbed the BitLicense, for which there is a $5,000 application fee, though some businesses noted that the legal and compliance work necessary for the application created additional costs.  Kraken, along with many other blockchain companies, decided against applying for the license and pulled their services from New York State. In 2018, the New York Attorney General opened an inquiry into cryptocurrency exchanges and sent letters to 13 exchanges, including Kraken. Powell said Kraken would not respond to the inquiry.  In 2019, Kraken became one the first exchange worldwide to offer futures trading after they acquired startup Crypto Facilities, for $100 million. Crypto Facilities is registered with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority. Within a month of the launch, Kraken saw nearly $1 billion in crypto futures trading across bitcoin, ether, litecoin, XRP and bitcoin cash.  In March 2020, Kraken pledged to reopen mothballed services in India, after the country's Supreme Court overturned a two-year ban that prohibited banks from working with crypto companies.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING,John Metais,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/kraken,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ab53b8cc2487b200d7d7ac3c9331fa8963e9813-1500x894.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The pair announced on May 26 they will use Vodafone SIM technology and Energy Web’s blockchain-based Decentralized Operating System as a communications backbone for the so-called edge devices that crowd power grids in the hundreds of millions.      This SIM-based identity system could turn grids’ increasingly distributed capacity into an information and control boon for the utility, said Walter Kok, CEO of the Zug, Switzerland-based Energy Web Foundation.      Grids now feature solar panels and electric cars and wind turbines and heat pumps that could all carry SIM cards, said Kok, who used to work at Vodafone. If they did, then they could also carry proof of identity to the grid operators via public private keys.      “If I say I’m a battery, [the grid operator] can be sure I actually am a battery and that I behave in this way. And then once I know that, I can actually start using this asset in how I manage my grid,” Kok said. “So that is what we’re building, and of course what we've done through the partnership with Vodafone.”      See also: China’s State Electricity Firm Eyes Blockchain for Internet of Energy      Vodafone Blockchain lead David Palmer said the SIM’s private key infrastructure allows devices to sign transactions on the Energy Web blockchain, all while remaining secure.

Many devices already do. Kok said that during his tenure at Vodafone in 2010 he saw manufacturers install SIM cards in everything from electric cars to washing machines. That trend has only accelerated in the decade since, making retrofitting rather straightforward      “We can hook up through [the SIM], we don’t have to do anything, just download the software from Voda and it's connected to the chain and has its own identity, because that's the beauty of it,” Kok said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/03/vodafone-enlists-blockchain-nonprofit-for-tracking-renewable-energy-use-in-europe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/528fa59463d03ceafd94423587f6db07ffba4e27-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404652,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjvNm,1591171272,Lightning Network Overhaul Could Strengthen Bitcoin Privacy – But Many 'Ifs' Remain,"Research is being conducted. Experiments are brewing. Behind the scenes, Lightning Network developers are planning to (eventually) completely rewrite an important part of bitcoin.      Known as Bitcoin's second layer because most of the action takes place off the blockchain, Lightning is being built out for faster, cheaper and more scalable bitcoin payments. The network is functional today, but it turns out it might make sense to strip out an important part and replace it with new technology to strengthen privacy.      Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs) are an integral piece of the Lightning Network, making it possible to send payments without trusting anyone. Now, developers are exploring replacing them with Point Timelock Contracts (otherwise known as ""payment points"" or PTLCs), which can do the same thing, they say, but better.      The idea was first proposed by pseudonymous Lightning developer ZmnSCPxj, whose open-source development work is sponsored by Square Crypto, an R&D arm of the Silicon Valley payments unicorn.      Read more: Square Crypto Bankrolls Star Lightning Developer Known as ‘ZmnSCPxj’      At the forefront of exploring this enhancement is Suredbits developer Nadav Kohen, who started looking into the idea because he was interested in the possibilities of bitcoin smart contracts, which describe more complex conditions required before a payment can be made, such as requiring a certain date to have passed, or requiring that the temperature somewhere be above, say, 90 degrees.      ""I've spent a lot more time digging into what can be done using PTLCs that can't be done with HTLCs and it turns out you can do some pretty complicated ... contracts without losing the privacy and speed provided by the Lightning Network,"" Kohen said. ""And furthermore, many existing Lightning-related proposals can become even more powerful and improved when using PTLCs.""      While the Lightning Network is still relatively young, developers are finding new, better ways of constructing it from the ground up. For example, Eltoo, if implemented, will also be a fundamental change to the network.    New possibilities    The Lightning Network is a global payments system made up of at least 12,000 nodes.      When someone sends a payment, under the hood it hops from one node to another until it reaches the destination. All this most likely occurs in a fraction of a second. The way payments move across the system without trusting the nodes that the user is passing their bitcoin through is by way of HTLCs.      HTLCs are so named because each node in a payment path receives a ""hash,"" a random-looking string of letters and numbers, which hides the secret that can be used to retrieve the bitcoin.      Read more: A New Twist On Lightning Tech Could Be Coming Soon to Bitcoin      One problem with HTLCs is that all intermediaries in the path get the same hash, which can be a problem from a privacy point of view because it gives snoops a little better idea of where a payment is coming from or where it's going.      ""If I was trying to do surveillance of payment activity on the Lightning Network, I could set up a bunch of routing nodes and if I route two payments in two different places that have the same hash, I can be sure that these two payments were on the same route which narrows the possible senders and receivers of this payment considerably,"" Kohen said.      PTLC, on the other hand, can add a ""random tweak"" at each hop, Kohen said, making it harder to tell that they are part of the same payment path. (Those interested in the technical bits can read Kohen's series of technical explanations.)      This is the reason Kohen believes the change is ""necessary"" for Lightning.      Developers have been trying to improve Lightning's privacy as much as possible. Bitcoin is quite transparent because every transaction is recorded in a public repository. The Lightning Network's ""off-chain"" transactions might show promise in changing this, since payments are not indelibly imprinted in the Bitcoin blockchain.      Read more: Bitcoin’s Future: Exactly How a Coming Upgrade Could Improve Privacy and Scaling      As a bonus, PTLCs open up some other possibilities too. They build in some protections against ""wormhole attacks,"" used by malicious actors to sneakily pilfer fees that are supposed to be paid to intermediary nodes, Nadav explained in his post.      And useful information can be stored in a PTLC, making it a possible tool for more complex smart contracts.      ""Specifically, there is very little useful information in a hash, while there is significant information that can be stored in a point,"" Kohen said.      In this way, PTLCs could be used for escrow, for example, or for ""oracles,"" long a hot topic in cryptocurrency, where payments depend on data incoming from the outside world.    Waiting on 'Schnorr'    Kohen and others are actively researching the change and its potential impact, but it will take some time before developers can make the shift.      Technically, the change could be added to Lightning now. At a virtual Lightning hackathon last month, Kohen, Blockstream engineer Jonas Nick, and others created a proof of concept over Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).      Read more: Bitcoiners Sprint to Improve Lightning Network in 2-Day Virtual Hackathon      Kohen argued the change is ""the best"" if it's built on top of Schnorr/Taproot, a likely upgrade that hasn't made its way into bitcoin just yet. Schnorr/Taproot offers a new way to ""sign"" transactions in bitcoin, which is how a user cryptographically proves that they own bitcoin and are allowed to transfer it to someone else. Schnorr/Taproot offers advantages over bitcoin's current signature scheme ECDSA.      Without Schnorr ready yet, Kohen and others only plan to use the ECDSA version to experiment with PTLCs in a sandbox so that once Schnorr rolls around they'll be ready.      ""Aside from theory, there is finally a way to do experimentation now. I'm really looking forward to seeing all of these proposals which have only been on paper come to life finally,"" Kohen said, adding:      ""I don't intend the current coding work that has been done using ECDSA adaptor signatures to end up in any Lightning implementation's actual production, but rather I intend to use ECDSA adaptor signatures to test out the large set of proposals that require PTLCs, as well as try to hit the pain points that are not specific to ECDSA-based PTLCs, so that we can have as much of a headstart as we can before Schnorr arrives and it is time to commit to a way of doing PTLCs on lightning.""    Coordination    But the steps don't end there. Once Schnorr is through, the change will require quite a bit of coordination.      The good news is Lightning developers Kohen has talked to agree the change should be made. So far, there's only been debate about implementation details.      ""I have yet to talk to a single person who does not believe that someday ... Lightning will for sure move to using PTLCs instead of HTLCs. I have met people who disagree about various implementation details but I've never met anyone who doesn't think that PTLCs are inherently superior to HTLCs without any real downside,"" Kohen told CoinDesk.      But even with agreement that the change will improve the lightning network, it is a huge change that will take time.      ""Rather than a 'few changes,' this would to date be the largest network-level update undertaken to the Lightning Network thus far,"" said Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun in an email discussing the change with other developers.      ""I'd caution against underestimating how long all of this will take in practice, and the degree of synchronization required to pull it all off properly,"" he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/03/lightning-network-overhaul-could-strengthen-bitcoin-privacy-but-many-ifs-remain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88f18d8220bc2f55fe511caef943c349d657324c-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
