Related Reading | Bitcoin Begins To Form A Bottom? Why $40K Is The Next Target Bitcoin As a Crypto Safe Haven The thought of Bitcoin (BTC) being a safe haven asset is quite popular, but it opposes the critics who claim BTC -and all crypto assets- is too risky, volatile, and speculative to become a safe haven. However, inside the crypto market it remains the less risky asset. January was a very volatile month for the crypto market amidst the investors fear over The Federal Reserve (FED) hawkish moves, but an Arcane Research report shed light on how Bitcoin outperformed the other crypto indexes in the market during the bloodshed, thus maintaining its image as the less risky crypto asset to investors, especially during times of high volatility and uncertainty. As traders take a more conservative position and look away from the most speculative assets, the Arcane report highlights how all crypto indexes saw losses between 20% and 31% this past month. However, like the following charts show, BTC outperformed all altcoins conserving the highest crypto market cap and counting less losses. Meanwhile, the Small Cap Index fell the hardest, showing how the crypto market shifted amidst the trad...",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bloody-altcoin-january-shows-why-bitcoin-remains-the-crypto-safe-haven/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

After a tumultuous downturn that had the whole market upside down, bitcoin&apos;s fiat price is relatively flat. Everyone can breathe and rest, for a while at least. What does this mean and how long will it last, though? That&apos;s what we&apos;re here to explore. Related Reading | Dwindling Bitcoin Volatility Could Lead To Decisive Move It&apos;s no secret that the market was expecting a hike in the interest rates, and thus people were selling risky assets. However, the powers that be postponed the increase, and, well, the market calmed down. During this downturn, though, Bitcoin proved once again that the market considers it the least risky asset in the cryptocurrency space. Everyone bled, but Bitcoin considerably less so. In any case, back to volatility, Arcane Research&apos;s The Weekly Update has the scoop: &apos;Bitcoin&apos;s 7-day volatility is now at the lowest level since November 2020. Together with the trading volume, the volatility exploded last week when bitcoin dropped below $40,000.

42375379,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7XMj,1643758356,First Mover Asia: Crypto Prices Rise With Investors' Appetite for Risk,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin opened February higher; China’s crypto community remains active after all.  Technician's take: Sideways trading between $35K-$40K BTC could persist this week as long-term momentum fades.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $38,818 +0.9%  Ether (ETH): $2,800 +4.3%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Solana SOL +13.5% Smart Contract Platform Filecoin FIL +11.5% Computing Polkadot DOT +10.4% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  ""There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,546 +0.6%  DJIA: 35,405 +0.7%  Nasdaq: 13,346 +0.7%  Gold: $1,801 +0.2%  Market moves  Bitcoin started February, a seasonally strong month for speculative assets, in green, as investors seemed ready to increase their exposure to risk assets.  At the time of publication, the oldest cryptocurrency was trading at a little below $39,000, up about 1% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up to $2,800, a more than 4% gain over the same time period.  According to Danny Chong, co-founder of Binance Smart Chain-based yield-enhancing asset tracker Tranchess, new investors, whether retail or institutional, may have entered the crypto market amid the lower prices in recent weeks.  “Compared to the traditional financial market, the crypto market is significantly smaller in market [capitalizations], enabling modest changes to create a more noticeable impact,” Chong said via a representative. “With rapid support at current levels as well as added liquidity from new and current users, a market rebound can happen relatively quickly as market sentiments turn positive.""  Data compiled by CoinDesk shows that bitcoin’s trading volume across major centralized exchanges on Tuesday was slightly lower than a day ago. As mentioned in previous First Mover Asia columns, major Asian markets are expecting a slowdown this week because many traders and investors are taking time off for the Chinese New Year/Lunar New Year celebrations.  While crypto trading and mining are banned in China, a well-known actor in China mentioned a random token during China’s Spring Festival Gala – reportedly the world’s most watched television program – and the token’s price rose by as much as 10 times within hours. Its price since then has dropped significantly.  The occurrence shows that despite many crypto observers believing China's market is dead, especially after exchanges such as Huobi removed mainland China users, many people in China are still active in the crypto community.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Rangebound Near Support; Resistance at $40K-$43K  Bitcoin (BTC) is holding support above $37,000, albeit within a narrow trading range.  The cryptocurrency is up slightly over the past 24 hours, up 3% over the past week.  Buyers will need to make a decisive move above the $40,000 resistance level in order to pause the intermediate-term downtrend from November.  For now, the relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is approaching overbought territory, which typically precedes a brief pullback in price. Additionally, the downward sloping 100-period moving average on the four-hour chart could limit price gains over the short term.  On the daily chart, however, the RSI continues to rise from oversold levels, which means buyers could remain active above the $35,000-$37,000 support zone. The wide range of support suggests sideways trading could persist this week, especially given weak momentum on longer-term charts.

Related Reading | Ethereum Price Surges 30% Over Last Week Lows, Addresses Holding Over 0.1 ETH Reach New ATH As of press time, Ethereum (ETH) trades at $2,788 with a 6.5% profit in the last 24 hours. Data from Arcane Research indicates that Ethereum has seen its seventh 50% drawdown since its inception. The second crypto by market cap dropped to a yearly low of $2,200 which represents a 55% decrease from its high at $4,812. During the crypto market most recent downside trend, ETH lost a total of over $280 billion in market cap which represents its biggest decline on this metric since its launched. By taking ETH&apos;s price as a proxy, it is possible to conclude the altcoin market as a whole suffered deeply in the past two months. In that sense, Arcane Research determined that this bearish price action to its yearly lows was one of Ethereum slowest in its history. It took ETH&apos;s price around 75 days to reached $2,200 compared to a 38-day average. Conversely, Ethereum has always experienced a higher average in terms of recovery. It takes ETH&apos;s price an average of 165 days to returned to previous highs, per conclusions from Arcane Research.

42375344,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7X1L,1643752449,MicroStrategy Takes $147M Impairment Charge on Bitcoin Holdings in Q4,"MicroStrategy (MSTR) reported a non-cash digital asset impairment charge of $146.6 million in the fourth quarter, up from $65.2 million in the prior quarter, according to its latest earnings statement.  The impairment reflects the decline in the price of bitcoin versus the price at which the bitcoin was acquired. Under standard accounting rules, the value of digital assets such as cryptocurrencies must be recorded at their cost and then only adjusted if their value is impaired, or goes down. But if the price rises, that does not get reflected until an asset is sold.  For 2021, MicroStrategy posted total digital asset impairment losses of $831 million, versus $71 million in 2020.  The company's 124,391 bitcoins held at the end of Dec. 31, 2021, were acquired for $3.752 billion, reflecting an average cost per bitcoin of approximately $30,159, the company reported.  MicroStrategy reported on Tuesday morning that it bought approximately 660 additional bitcoins for around $25 million between Dec. 30, 2021, and Jan. 31, 2022. This gives the company a total of 125,051 bitcoins, valued at about $4.8 billion at the current bitcoin price of $38,700.  The SEC recently objected to MicroStrategy’s accounting adjustment for its bitcoin holdings. The company later told the commission that it would “revise its disclosures of non-GAAP measures in future filings to remove the adjustment for impairment losses and gains on sale related to bitcoin, as requested by the Commission.”  On its earnings call Tuesday, MicroStrategy's CFO Phong Le said the company expects an additional significant impairment charge during the first quarter of 2022 given bitcoin's volatility. Le added that MicroStrategy is working with other companies and various agencies to ""determine a more appropriate accounting framework for digital assets.""  Le says MicroStrategy's balance sheet can weather any headwinds as no debt is coming due until December 2025.  Shares of MicroStrategy were down about 1% in after-hours trading. Shares have fallen around 33% over the last month.

42375361,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7XLT,1643751312,"Market Wrap: Cryptos Stabilize, Analysts Expect Bitcoin Short Squeeze","Cryptocurrencies are starting to stabilize after falling in January, and some analysts expect prices to recover this month, especially as several alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) outperformed bitcoin over the past week.  Bitcoin was roughly flat over the past 24 hours, versus a 2% gain in ether (ETH) and a 10% gain in SOL over the same period. Metaverse tokens such as MANA and SAND failed to sustain Monday's rally as both tokens declined as much as 5% over the past 24 hours.  On Tuesday, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a 30% tax on any income from the transfer of virtual digital assets, a first for the nation. ""India is finally on the path to legitimizing the crypto sector in India,"" said Nischal Shetty, co-founder and CEO of WazirX, one of India’s largest crypto exchanges. The announcement didn't trigger a significant market response.  Analysts expect regulatory headwinds to fade over the short term, which could boost investor sentiment. For example, the crypto Fear & Greed Index is starting to rise from extreme lows, indicating more bullish activity. And in the bitcoin futures market, there are signs of a pending short squeeze, which occurs when prices unexpectedly rise, forcing short sellers to exit positions.  For now, some buyers continue to return on dips. MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR), the software company that’s taken to accumulating bitcoin, said it bought about 660bitcoins for about $25 million between Dec. 30 and Jan. 31.  Technical indicators suggest a possible rise in BTC could be limited at the $40,000-$45,000 range as long-term momentum weakens.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $38587, +0.35%    ●Ether (ETH): $2775, +3.35%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4546, +0.68%    ●Gold: $1801 per troy ounce, +0.31%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.80%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Improving sentiment  The crypto Fear & Greed Index rose from ""extreme fear"" territory last week, which means bearish sentiment has started to fade. The index is now near its July 2020 lows, which preceded a recovery in crypto prices.  ""On Sunday, the index briefly hit 30 - the highest level in 2022,"" Arcane Research wrote in a Tuesday report. Still, some analysts prefer to see an increase in trading volume to confirm a shift from bearish to bullish sentiment.  ""Bitcoin is currently fighting with the $40,000 resistance, and if it manages to break it, we might see a similar volume explosion as when it dropped below this level. Until then, trading activity might be muted as momentum traders often wait for specific price action before making directional bets,"" Arcane Research wrote.  Possible short squeeze  Bitcoin will need to make a decisive break above $40,000 in order to trigger short liquidations. The chart below shows the recent decline in long liquidations, which typically precede short liquidations (or a short squeeze) as the price of BTC recovers.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. That happens primarily in futures trading.  ""With high negativity, elevated leverage, and an overall short bias, a reasonable argument could be made for a potential counter-trend short squeeze in the near-term,"" Glassnode, a crypto data firm, wrote in a recent blog post.  Altcoin roundup  Litecoin’s pivotal MWEB upgrade is now released: David Burkett, the lead developer behind Litecoin’s Mimblewimble Extension Block (MWEB) upgrade as a ""RC"" (release candidate), has confirmed that MWEB has now been officially released, following an intense multiyear process of development, testing, reviewing and auditing, along with the help of dozens of key contributors. Once miners receive the completed code, they may begin signaling for MWEB activation right away. Once a threshold is met, the activation date will be locked in, and as a result, MWEB will go live. This release comes after Quarkslab, a respected security and code auditing company, completed a review/audit of the MWEB code. Litecoin’s LTC token was up 5% over the past 24 hours.

Hosted by the developer and entrepreneur Marguerite deCourcelle (also known as Coin Artist), along with Jason Bailey, who’s spent years chronicling the development of the digital art space on his blog, “Artnome,” “NFT All-Stars” takes a holistic approach to an industry that seems to grow and change every other day.  NFT All-Stars, CoinDesk's new animated series, premieres Tuesday, Feb. 1 at 4 p.m. ET. Watch it weekly on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitch, Theta.TV and CoinDesk.com.  None of it is precisely scripted. The conversations, with the likes of Roc-A-Fella Records’ Dame Dash, the artist FEWOCiOUS and the DJ Deadmau5, are lively and free-flowing, meant to educate as much as entertain. It’s informed by deCourcelle and Bailey’s backgrounds in blockchain – they’ve dealt with this stuff long enough to know the difference between a fad and a genuine movement.  Both are also investors, too: deCourcelle’s company, Blockade Games, builds puzzles and games built around NFTs. Bailey’s is ClubNFT, an all-purpose NFT company dedicated to “building the next generation of solutions to discover, protect, and share” these tokens.  Other “NFT All-Stars” panelists include BT, a composer and arranger who’s worked with the likes of Death Cab for Cutie, Madonna, and Britney Spears; Jenny Guo, co-founder of the tech company Highstreet; and Anand Venkateswaran, also known as Twobadour, the official “steward” of the firm that paid $69 million for a Beeple NFT at Christie’s last year.  Our conversation with the show’s two co-hosts, edited and condensed for clarity, is below.  How did the show come together?  Jason Bailey: There wasn't ever a scripted thing. In fact, it was almost like an anti-script, where Adam [Levine, the show’s producer] was like, “I want it to feel like a casual conversation.” And we knew that we had a target audience that we couldn't get overly technical with, which is hard, because I think both Marguerite and I are nerds, in different ways. An audience that we had to maybe assume was new to NFTs.  Read more: 5 Ways to Earn Passive Income From NFTs  As we were recording these episodes, where the world really was opening up the floodgates to NFTs. And as part of that growth, it caught the eye of a lot of celebrities, musicians, comedians and all sorts of different folks that we were able to interview. Our job was really to try to get them to talk about what that experience has been like for them, and sort of facilitate the conversation and share some of our perspective.  Marguerite deCourcelle: I really enjoyed the process of coming together and learning in real time about these incredible people and what they were excited about exploring, what they were looking forward to, where they found themselves in the NFT space – a lot of them coming from very authentic places of excitement, and not just here to flip JPEGs.  Why animation?  MdC: The experience of watching it this way, it really has that metaverse feel to it. It’s an alternate reality. Actually, it reminds me of one of those old school MTV shows, it has a real sense of character to it. It's saturated with creativity, and so I think it was important for it to be so thoughtful and colorful.  JB: I remember Ali [Powell, a producer on the show] compared it sometimes to “Space Ghost Coast to Coast,” as sort of an inspiration. Sometimes these conversations can get overly serious, about art or blockchain or culture. And I think it adds some levity to the whole thing. You took a wrong turn if you can't laugh a little bit about NFTs. Especially in the art space, even the most ardent collectors and proponents like myself … we know that it's also kind of absurd. Like, you're buying JPEGs you can see for free. And I know it's more than that, but there's an element of humor and lightheartedness that you need to have about all of this.  You mention “JPEGs you can see for free” – what’s your take on NFT skepticism?  JB: I think we're seeing maybe an all-time high right now. I've actually been referring to it as a moral panic that people are having around NFTs, like the Satanic Panic in the ‘80s, when people started accusing each other of being satanists. Or it’s like Reefer Madness. There's just this illogical, outsized concern about NFTs right now. I'm open to criticism and think we need criticism in order for the space to move forward, but I think we're seeing more criticism than ever before.  At the time that we initially recorded these [episodes], I think we were still a little bit more in the honeymoon period of the world figuring out what these things were. We kept it light, and it was sort of intentionally meant to be light.  MdC: Coming from the Bitcoin space, too, it's such a contrast – I felt like I couldn't really talk about things if I wasn't a cryptographer. And as a creative, I spent a lot of time being like, ‘how do I get to participate in this really tech-centric, totally male dominated, and sometimes unfriendly space?’  Read more: Minting Your First NFT: A Beginner’s Guide to Creating an NFT  When I went to the first Ethereum conferences, I was kind of surprised about the effort that that community was making for inclusivity.

Do you feel encouraged by the direction of the space right now, in regard to diversity and inclusion?  MdC: I feel like the NFT space is going through an identity crisis, and I don't align with a lot of things that are happening. I don't really enjoy – and it took me a while to figure this out – but I don't enjoy the party culture, to the extreme, without real purpose or intention. Just people showboating money or NFTs.  When you get into these VIP parties, and everyone there's a crypto-influencer, and then you're in the back channels with a lot of them, and everyone's pumping their bags, or their projects. It gets this really skeezy feeling to it.  And while it's fun for some of the people at the top, look at the backlash everywhere. If you look at mainstream people who are not fully educated, or haven't really been introduced in a friendly way to NFTs, it's insanely polarizing. And that's because we built this culture that's exclusive.  Real artists – people who have chosen a path in which they want to create art and meaningful experiences – are not going to prioritize taking care of collectors and making them more rich, versus their opportunity and freedom to create expressive artwork. When I think of Rothko, I don't think of [him] because he had the highest-selling artworks. It's because I liked how he challenged the art space.  Granted, sometimes these things go hand in hand. But the fact is we don't have people here actually appreciating the artwork. We have a culture of speculators and artists trying to figure out their place in it. And it's just not friendly for a lot of people that truly have wonderful ambitions. And it's just gonna take time.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/01/with-nft-all-stars-two-crypto-art-veterans-take-the-conversation-further,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ae2a768ae02739ef999aa36879db6fa631fe04b-3264x3264.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375346,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7X3r,1643748202,El Salvador Using Crypto Software Firm AlphaPoint to Fix Chivo Wallet Problems,"El Salvador has been using technology from crypto software firm AlphaPoint to fix a series of problems that have plagued its state-run bitcoin wallet Chivo, the government and the company announced on Tuesday.  AlphaPoint started shoring up Chivo’s problematic front- and back-end infrastructure for its app and payment processing capabilities in December after striking an agreement with the administration of El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, AlphaPoint co-founder and CEO Igor Telyatnikov told CoinDesk. But the parties didn't disclose the arrangement until Tuesday.        The change of supplier comes after hundreds of Salvadorans complained that hackers had illegally activated wallets associated with the nine-digit numbers on their identity cards and dozens reported on social media that money had disappeared from their Chivo wallets.  AlphaPoint is now providing the technology behind Chivo’s mobile application, mobile point-of-sale processing, merchant website portal, call-center support software and administrative console, it said in a statement. Telyatnikov said that “the majority of complaints” about the Chivo Wallet were prior to AlphaPoint's entry.  Before AlphaPoint, the operator of bitcoin automated teller machines, Athena Bitcoin, provided the technology infrastructure for the Chivo wallet, Athena Bitcoin told CoinDesk. The company did not specify the reasons for the contract's termination.  AlphaPoint has been in operation for nine years and currently has more than 50 clients, although the agreement with El Salvador is its first with a government.  According to Telyatnikov, AlphaPoint had unsuccessfully applied to be the software provider for the Chivo wallet before its launch in September.  AlphaPoint software aims to improve Lightning Network integration, accelerating transaction speed and reducing the cost of bitcoin transactions via QR codes and Lightning addresses. The Chivo wallet uses machine-learning facial recognition and authentication technology provided by digital identity startup Netki.  According to a tweet published by Bukele on Jan. 19, the Chivo wallet already has 4 million user, in a country with 6.5 million inhabitants.

42394321,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbWfZ,1643747623,What ‘Line Goes Up’ Gets Wrong (and Right) About NFTs,"Dan Olson, the Canadian videographer behind the “Folding Ideas” YouTube channel, has an important message for the world: NFTs are all fundamentally flawed. More so, crypto, Web 3 – those umbrella trends often discussed in hurried tones – would be a huge step back. Last week, Olson published a 137-minute documentary, “Line Goes Up – The Problem With NFTs,” going through the myriad issues crypto-based tech faces and creates.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The video already has 3.7 million views, making it Olson’s most popular release yet, and likely one of the most consumed individual pieces of media about crypto ever. It has been shared widely in broader tech circles. It’s not hard to see why. Olson tells a convincing story about the perils of market speculation and greed – it’s real, human drama. He starts off discussing mortgage-backed securities and the cascading market failure in 2008, the context in which Bitcoin and Ethereum were created, and shows how that capitalistic mindset rhymes with modern speculative subsectors like NFTs and DAOs.  Has crypto recreated the system it meant to circumvent?  For Olson, crypto is even worse. The technology is broken, he says, but, even if it worked, it would be net negative. His arguments are well researched and justifiable. Although there are a few factual inaccuracies (about Ethereum’s energy use, for instance), it’s tough to object to his overall point. Saying crypto fosters scammers and has real privacy issues and environmental concerns isn’t a matter of opinion. Still, there are gradations and contexts to consider, all of which could be a topic for a competing YouTube takedown video – a blog will have to do.  One of Olson’s most salient points is that people in crypto rarely take criticism well. This is fair. It was certainly on display in reaction to his video. Even industry leaders often fall back on responding to negative news or comments by labeling it FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt). Olson’s video found an audience because his concerns resonate with people. Crypto would do well by actually watching and listening to the video.  Even though crypto personalities can be abrasive or borderline antisocial, it’s worth noting they’re often self-aware and ironic. Take “right-click save,” the rallying cry of both NFT notables and critics. It’s an obvious line of attack to say supposedly “scarce” digital goods are infinitely reproducible by right-clicking and saving that JPEG. However, NFTs have utility by giving digital goods unique identities and that identity a market price … sharing an image across the web and giving it virality in some sense only makes it more valuable. But it’s an idea you sort of have to lean into.  The Defiant’s multimedia guru Robin Schmidt published a 10-minute video response to Olson, arguing that NFTs are really just a glorified file format. There’s good and bad with any technological standard, and the societal concerns Olson raises are just as easily applied to any social media environment. Casey Newton, writer of “The Platformer” Substack, similarly noted that Olson’s hatred of crypto is as a vector of “rising inequality, pandemic-era isolation and loneliness, self-dealing venture capitalists, and a desperate sense among young strivers that the future is only ever getting smaller.” Again, those issues do not belong to crypto alone.  For as substantial as Olson’s video is, he doesn’t really present any solutions. And who can blame him? We’re talking about rewriting the rules of the internet and society so speculative bubbles like NFTs wouldn’t be so attractive in the first place. Digital scarcity, empowering people to create markets for anything and letting people monetize their digital lives is a massive sea change – and one that comes with its own benefits. If there is a critical flaw in Olson’s video, it’s that he never truly considered the other side.  See also: 'Probably Nothing': Why People Still Hate Crypto | The Node  People young and old are excited about crypto because it presents an alternative to the current economic system. Just to say one thing: Those bankers Olson discussed at the beginning of his documentary, the ones that turned the U.S. housing market into a casino and blew up the economy – what happened to them? Did Jimmy Cayne go to jail? Did Lloyd Blankfein lose his job? I don’t bemoan wealth or value creation, but I’m a little perturbed that there’s a yacht shortage today. Crypto doesn’t fix all of that, it may even make it worse. But at least, if done right, it eliminates moral hazard. Crypto puts responsibility on the individual – and if they lose their keys, or lose their savings, that’s on them. It’s a high degree of responsibility and no one forces you to buy a JPEG.  Olson argues that NFTs are particularly perverse because they act as the top of the funnel to the crypto market. They’re one of the few things you can do with ETH or SOL, and have easy cultural tie-ins. He sees brands issuing NFTs, or brands being born from them, and thinks this is a pipeline to the larger crypto ecosystem. This appears bad if you think crypto is bad in itself, rather than just another potential avenue for monetization. The digital economy today is fundamentally broken. There are plenty of people who would willingly trade their personal data for free services, but we shouldn’t bemoan an alternative. Online payments are surveillance and can be censored – why not have an alternative?  Digital media likewise struggles. Streaming companies are unprofitable and likely unsustainable. Journalism is in crisis. NFTs are not the perfect or only solution, but they present an alternative. Just today, legacy magazine Sports Illustrated announced an NFT marketplace. Digital artist Pak is issuing NFTs to benefit WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The Associated Press is auctioning historic photographs from its collection, with the profits going to support AP’s journalism. Despite being plagued by scams, crypto provides real avenues to assist real people.  There are moments in “Line Goes Up” that truly soar. Calling NFTs the “aesthetically vacuous representations of the dead inner lives of the tech and finance bros behind them” is poetry because it’s true. He goes on, calling them “the vanguard for a new system,” one that’s littered with pyramid schemes and “fugly” cartoon apes. “A different system does not inherently mean a better system. We replace bad systems with worse ones all the time,” Olson said. (He didn’t return a request for comment, by the way.)  The question I’d ask is how much of the new system is really the old?",NEGATIVE,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/01/what-line-goes-up-gets-wrong-and-right-about-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8639e8ec685c6297cbd3bf42bf1ac99049e5298-2048x1282.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Percentage of Bitcoin Supply On Exchanges Sinks To Multi-Year Low As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the percentage of the BTC supply on exchanges has now declined to a multi-year low of around 13.27%. The &apos;percentage of supply on exchanges&apos; is an indicator that measures the percent of the total circulating Bitcoin supply that&apos;s currently stored in exchange wallets. When the value of this indictor goes up, it means the amount of coins held by exchanges is going up. This trend can be bearish for the price of the crypto as investors usually deposit their BTC to exchanges for selling purposes. On the other hand, when the metric moves down, it implies holders are withdrawing their coins from exchanges, thus reducing their reserve. Such a trend may be bullish for Bitcoin as the supply on exchanges is usually considered the selling supply, and it going down would mean there is lesser sell pressure in the market.

42394315,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbWL3,1643738877,Why India Isn’t Buying NFTs (Yet),"2022 is expected to be the year of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). At $40 billion, the global market capitalization for NFTs is inching closer to the entire global art market cap of $50 billion. However, one of the potentially largest markets for NFTs – India – is facing teething troubles.  Tanvi Ratna, a CoinDesk columnist, is the founder and CEO of Policy 4.0, a research and advisory body working on new policy approaches for digital assets.  Indian experiments with NFTs have grown rapidly in the last eight months or so. In June 2021, WazirX, India’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, launched an NFT marketplace predominantly for Indian artists. In the time since, multiple Bollywood celebrities and sports stars have launched NFTs. The largest global NFT sale to date, the $69 million Beeple sale, was incidentally also purchased by a buyer of Indian origin, Vignesh Sundaresan, also known as MetaKovan. But oddly enough, Indians have not started buying into NFTs just yet.  The supply and demand gap  There is a fairly large supply and demand gap in the Indian NFT market. NFT creators here are proliferating while collectors remain nonexistent. Both sides paint a different picture of how they see the NFT opportunity in India.  From the creator perspective, opportunity abounds. The talent landscape for art and digital art in India is vibrant – from graphic designers and illustrators, to specialized visual effects (VFX) artists working for Hollywood and Bollywood, to a rich traditional art heritage spanning many diverse styles. The young and savvy have already taken to the NFT space and the numbers are growing. WazirX has an active Indian creator community of 1,300 artists and has a waitlist of 20,000 artists waiting to be onboarded into the marketplace.  SamosaRani is one such successful creator with over 18 NFT sales and three collections under her belt across OpenSea and other markets. An art therapist and artist for two decades, she has found a great niche for her art in the NFT space. However, none of her dedicated collectors are Indian, and only a small fraction of her one-off buyers are from India. ""Finding collectors is a difficult task for most Indian artists,"" she told me.  Read more: India Edges Toward Crypto Legalization With 30% Tax, Announces Digital Rupee  Interestingly, Indian NFT creators have migrated into becoming NFT collectors and traders. CreatiWitty, a top performer on the Kalamint platform, started off as a creator but now spends 100% of his time flipping NFTs. His story is the kind that motivates many artists across the country to enter the NFT space. He used to be a freelance graphic designer in a small town in the Indian state of Gujarat, designing logos and branding for companies. “It used to take me three days to design logos with customers complaining and constantly needing changes. Now, in a matter of minutes, I can flip an NFT and earn two times, three times what I used to make with three days of effort,” he said in an interview.  From a mass adoption perspective, however, NFT collectibles are not quite finding a product market fit in India. A limited set of Indian collectors leverage NFTs for speculative uses. This small Indian collector community cites a preference for high liquidity NFTs, with PFP (photo for profile) art and photos as the best performing categories.  Sandeep Sangli, the founder of NFT platform Kalamint said: “Historically Indians have not been collectors. Art is something Indians haven’t really warmed up to as an asset class. For NFTs to work in India they need to have utility.”  Indeed, different players in the market are coming to terms with the real value in India being for utility-based NFTs. Sangli said one of the higher performing segments in Kalamint is for brands and entrepreneurs to cross promote and sell NFTs that can be redeemed on their site for goods. WazirX experimented selling NFT tickets for a music festival in its marketplace. These sold out in record time.  Enter Bollywood  It is not for lack of trying that NFT collectibles have not taken off. Bollywood and cricket are two rich cultural categories, and it was only natural that celebrities in both spheres gravitated towards NFTs. Between June and December 2021, several movie stars and cricket players released NFTs. But these launches saw a relatively lukewarm response.  Amitabh Bachhan, Bollywood’s biggest superstar, affectionately known as “Big B,” launched an NFT collection with several thoughtful collectibles, including poem readings and even a Big B CryptoPunk. The entire collection sold for just under $1 million. While this is not bad, it does not compare to big ticket NFT sales we have seen around the world, especially given that Big B is India's biggest superstar by a mile with cross-generational appeal. Single CryptoPunks (the original must-have NFTs) have sold for many multiples of this, from $3 million to $12 million. The sale also pales in comparison to NFTs by other celebrities. Mila Kunis’ Stoner Cats collection, which gave access for a series that has not even launched, pulled an easy $8 million.  Celebrities are now expanding beyond pure NFTs into full metaverse plays. One of the first to experiment deeply with this has been Bollywood star Kunal Kapoor who is now building out the LoveABot/LABverse project. “I wanted to do something to change the narrative around the tech dystopia and a tech-driven future that we fear,” he told me. He is on a mission to build a creative metaverse for technologists where a tech-positive narrative can be created.  Another actor, Rana Daggubati, of the iconic “Baahubali” movie franchise, is venturing into an ambitious Indian metaverse, with the Ikonz project. CEO Abhinav Kalidindi believes that “we need to drive a change in mindset, but with it, India would be one of the largest metaverse and NFT markets in the world.”  Read more: India's Millennials Embrace Digital Gold Despite Proposed Bitcoin Ban  It has placed a bet on a unique metaverse with Indian characteristics, having secured IP rights to the “Baahubali” franchise, as well as widely read and loved Indian comic brands, “Tinkle” and “Amar Chitra Katha.” But in line with experience from other Indian projects, Kalidindi said “building NFTs with utility at value-conscious price for Indians” will be key to their success.  Name of the game  With this backdrop to India’s budding NFT sector, all stakeholders are now looking to India’s gaming sector for that ultimate product market fit with NFTs. India’s gaming sector has exploded in the last year, recording 170% growth between 2020 and 2021 alone, and the market is expected to triple by 2025. With over 450 million gamers, industry players are betting this will create the right growth market for NFTs.  Indian creators and collectors have started looking into gaming NFTs. Some interviewees have already started experimenting with gaming skins and related NFTs. They often presell NFTs that will be used in games as a form of fundraising. “With enough hype around these games, we see a lot of collectors buying ahead and flipping these NFTs,” said Kalamint's Sangli. He believes a gaming and content utility might be the most preferred by Indians.  Ikonz’s Kalidindi put it accurately when he said, “NFT collectibles may have value globally but not for Indians. Crypto gaming is massive and in India play-to-earn games do really well. This is where India might find the right product market fit for NFTs.”  As experimentation in the country accelerates, it will be interesting to see how Indian attitudes to NFTs evolve.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Tanvi Ratna,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/01/why-india-isnt-buying-nfts-yet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4e526125506f59dc39601828a54288c64eda57f0-1600x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394325,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbXAL,1643738664,"Diem May Be Gone, but Its Legacy Lives On","The Diem Association will wind down its operations in the coming weeks after selling its assets to Silvergate Bank. It's time to revisit the chief legacy it leaves behind: A more involved regulatory framework than it may have intended.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Bonum noctis  The narrative  The Facebook-backed Diem Association is shutting down operations, just two and a half years after it was revealed to the world as Libra.  Why it matters  We’re talking about Diem again, not because it is interesting – I'm not saying it isn't, that's just not the point of today's newsletter – but because the regulations that will potentially be implemented as a result of this project are fascinating to think about.  Breaking it down  Where do I even start?  Diem, formerly known as Libra, has reached an untimely end. It announced last night that it will begin unwinding its businesses days after various news outlets reported that it was in talks with Silvergate Bank to sell off its assets and technology to repay investors. Silvergate confirmed the deal last night.  Under the terms of the deal, Silvergate paid $50 million in cash and gave another $132 million in Class A shares, which Diem will use to repay investors. In turn, Silvergate will get all of Diem's intellectual property and technology tooling, which it will use to help launch a stablecoin by the end of the year.  I wrote a complete timeline documenting Diem’s history back in April 2020, and it’s updated through this week’s news. You can read it here.  For a project that never got off the ground, Libra has a remarkable legacy. Arguably, every major piece of stablecoin regulation or legislation proposed over the past two and a half years has been tinged with the idea that a company, somewhere, might decide to create its own stable value currency based on blockchain technology. We’ve seen this in recommendations from the Bank for International Settlements to China’s central bank digital currency to the U.S. President’s Working Group for Financial Markets report on stablecoin regulation.  The House Financial Services Committee and Senate Banking Committee both plan to hold hearings on the PWG report this month. While we don’t have a lot of details yet, it’s safe to say the hearings will be a prelude to legislation on stablecoins. Elsewhere in the world, we’re seeing regulators start to implement rules on stablecoins.  Diem engaged with regulators throughout its life.  ""As we undertook this effort, we actively sought feedback from governments and regulators around the world, and the project evolved substantially and improved as a result,"" Diem CEO Stuart Levey said in a statement announcing the shutdown. ""In the United States, a senior regulator informed us that Diem was the best-designed stablecoin project the U.S. government had seen.""  Levey also mentioned the PWG report, saying it validated the project's ""code design features,"" including how it addresses stablecoin transfer risks.  The thing is, the original Libra vision of a basket-backed stablecoin was dead long before the association rebranded to Diem. Today, one could draw a comparison to tether (USDT) or US dollar coin (USDC) in that they are now backed by baskets of assets, though not baskets of currencies. They aren’t quite the same, but they are probably similar enough. The chief concerns were how the libra stablecoin might affect financial stability, how it might be used and whether users were protected. The same questions apply to stablecoins backed by baskets containing securities or other cryptocurrencies.  The big difference – and I want to revisit this more in depth in a future issue – is that Facebook was involved. Lawmakers and regulators were aware of stablecoins, but didn’t really care about them as an imminent threat.  Facebook announced Libra in a carefully managed press event. Reporters flew to San Francisco for embargoed briefings, press releases and technical documents were shared under prearranged agreements not to publish before a specific time, and swarms of reporters spent time trying to unpack what was being announced.  Libra, and later Diem, was never able to overcome Facebook's shadow, however much everyone involved with the project tried to draw a clear distinction.  For a parting thought, imagine how much regulatory brain power has been dedicated to this project over the past 30 months. It's a lot! Surreal to imagine almost.  The FinCEN rule rises  The infamous unhosted wallet rule is once again on the Treasury Department’s radar. The department published its semiannual agenda over the weekend, detailing its priorities over the next six months.  The unhosted wallet rule first proposed in December 2020 was on the document, implying that Treasury (or the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the ostensible sponsor) is looking at the rule.  At first blush, this would seem to be another attempt at bringing forth know-your-customer rules for self-hosted/user-hosted/what-have-you wallets. Treasury, however, may just be keeping the rule alive just in case it does want to eventually get back to wallet rules.  The rule appears in previous semiannual agendas as well, but Treasury didn't make any move on the rule last year.  The important details: Treasury bifurcated the rule in early 2021. The rule received enough comments the last time that a whole new comment process may need to kick off before Treasury can finalize or adopt the counterparty data collection provision or the overall rule as originally proposed. If Treasury just wants to adopt the currency transaction report provision (which would bring crypto reporting rules in line with current cash rules), there may not be much opposition.  What's more, I'm told FinCEN may still not want the counterparty provision in its current form.  Long story short, this rule has made a reappearance, but there's no real sign it will move forward just yet.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  The Senate Banking Committee will hold a nomination hearing for Federal Reserve Board nominees Sarah Bloom Raskin, Lisa DeNell Cook and Philip Nathan Jefferson on Thursday.  It’s also the last week for Jelena McWilliams, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), who announced on New Year’s Eve that her resignation would be effective on Feb. 4.

The first set, called the Coachella Keys Collection, consists of just 10 tokens, each offering lifetime festival access and other VIP goodies (among them, a “celebrity chef dinner”). There’s also the Desert Reflections Collection – 1,000 tokens priced at $180 each, which buyers can redeem for a physical copy of a Coachella photo book – and the Sights and Sounds Collection, which mostly just gets you the token and audiovisual accompaniment. The Sights and Sounds NFTs are priced at $60 each, and will launch in an edition of 10,000.  “Only blockchain technology can give us the unique ability to offer tradeable lifetime passes to Coachella for the first time ever,” Coachella Innovation Lead Sam Schoonover said in a statement.  Coachella – headlined this year by Harry Styles, Billie Eilish and Kanye West – isn’t the first music festival to experiment with crypto. This past year, New York’s Governor’s Ball offered NFTs through a partnership with Coinbase.  According to a press release, an undisclosed portion of the proceeds from Coachella’s NFTs will go to three charities: GiveDirectly, Lideres Campesinas and Find Food Bank.  In an attempt to get ahead of anticipated backlash, FTX has also purchased 100,000 tons of carbon offsets.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL | SPONSORED,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/01/coachella-music-festival-to-launch-solana-nfts-in-deal-with-ftx,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cffc7542fd5060797c58c8c860a986b3de5024c4-2000x1000.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The newly launched Funds II include an early stage-focused $300 million vehicle, and a $200 million fund that will invest in Series A and B funding rounds. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the news.  “With the current trajectory of talented product designers and engineers, yes, a majority of our future investments will likely be in crypto, but we follow the lead of the smartest founders we meet, so if they keep building in Web3, we’ll keep funding them,” Ohanian told CoinDesk via email.  Crypto investments now account for about 40% of the firm's portfolio, according to the Journal. They include play-to-earn video game pioneer Axie Infinity, bitcoin rewards startup Lolli and crypto tax company CoinTracker.  The new funding brings 776’s total assets under management to $750 million, the firm said in a press release.  VC money is flooding into crypto, with firms such as Paradigm, Sequoia and Tiger Global deploying billions of dollars into “Web 3,” a more decentralized version of the existing internet.  Ohanian was one of the early investors in Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange that went public last year at a valuation of over $85 billion. Most recently, 776 teamed up with Ethereum-scaling platform Polygon to create a $200 million initiative to invest in social media and Web 3-based projects.  “We feel a deep responsibility to help usher in this new age of technology, with intention – both through the founders we choose to invest in and how we support them in their important work,” Ohanian said in a statement.

In the latest blockchain craze, Non-fungible tokens (NFT&apos;s) are also being embraced by the country.

In 2021, new crackdowns forced exchanges like Huobi to completely stop serving Chinese customers.

Senior vice president of cryptocurrency and digital currencies at PayPal, Jose Fernandez da Ponte said that if the company expects to press forward with the stablecoin, it will do so while working closely with relevant regulators. This approach could help the fintech company avoid the wrath of US senators that killed Meta&apos;s Diem cryptocurrency project.

Brady played for the New England Patriots for 20 years, winning a record six Super Bowls with that team before joining the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and winning a seventh in 2021. ESPN reporter Adam Schefter first reported Brady's retirement on Saturday.  ""The future is exciting,"" Brady wrote in an Instagram post. ""I'm fortunate to have cofounded incredible companies like [Autograph, BRADY and TB12 Sports] that I am excited to continue to help build and grow, but exactly what my days will look like will be a work-in-progress.""  The quarterback announced Autograph, his non-fungible token (NFT) platform, in April, saying the company would help athletes and other famous individuals create and market their own digital collectibles. The company partnered with DraftKings and Lionsgate to create NFTs based on film franchises as well as sports stars.  Autograph raised $170 million earlier this month with backing from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Katie Haun and Kleiner Perkins. But Brady said he's been interested in crypto for far longer than just the past year.  He told CoinDesk's Consensus 2021 conference that he wanted to be part of the crypto industry after discussing it with one of his coaches heading into the 2020 season.  ""It's really been a crash course in this offseason. All these things happen pretty quickly,"" he said at the time. ""But obviously the more I learned about crypto and blockchain technologies, I really was wanting to be a part of building a great platform that could create opportunities for myself, other artists, other entertainment brands to create great collectibles.""  While Brady at that time said he did not think the NFL would pay its athletes in crypto directly, he does believe an increasing number of football players may choose to invest in digital assets, saying he had invested in some crypto.  On football, Brady said during Consensus that he enjoyed playing with teammates ""half [his] age"" because he felt he could mentor these younger players. Brady is 44 years old.  ""It's not about me going, 'Wow, I've accomplished this in comparison to what everyone else has, in my particular career,'"" he said. ""It's really about 'what were the opportunities that were presented to me, and based on all the things and experiences that have happened in my life the people that have come into my life, how do I make the most of my opportunity?'""  At the time he had just won his seventh Super Bowl, setting a record for having more NFL championships than any player or team in the league.

MyCrypto will eventually merge with ConsenSys’ hugely popular MetaMask wallet.  “With our talents combined, and our strong sense of shared ethics and goals for this ecosystem, I think we’ll be able to provide a wallet experience that is much more able to help its users make the best decisions through this rapidly evolving Web 3 wallet landscape,” said Dan Finlay, co-founder of MetaMask.  MetaMask currently has 21 million monthly active users, but the acquisition would bring the wallet to more platforms and deepen its integrations as it is currently offered only through mobile apps and web browser extensions. MyCrypto offers its Ethereum account management solutions through browsers and desktop applications.  User safety and product security are hallmarks to both MetaMask and MyCrypto, said Taylor Monahan, founder and CEO of MyCrypto, speaking with CoinDesk. Security, she said, is of increasing importance as the ecosystem grows and a more diverse range of people enter the crypto space. “We want to make sure that everyone has a good experience with cryptocurrency. Namely, not losing all of their crypto.""  While the eventual goal is to combine the MyCrypto and MetaMask wallets, the products will remain independent under the same brand umbrella in the near term. The teams don’t have a timeline for the merger, added Monahan, preferring instead to allow the process to happen organically. The unified products will be headed by Monahan, alongside MetaMask co-founders Dan Finlay and Aaron Davis. MyCrypto’s team of 12 employees will also join ConsenSys.  Led by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, Brooklyn, N.Y.-based ConsenSys is a titan in the Ethereum ecosystem, having developed a blockchain product suite that includes Diligence for smart contract audits and security, blockchain for business protocol Quorum and developer toolkit Truffle.

42410928,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtSYE,1643726106,Wonderland Founder: ‘I’m Here to Fix This and Make It All Back’,"The founder of a popular DeFi protocol is promising to make users whole after a scandal-ridden price implosion, but the path to achieving that isn’t totally clear.  On Monday, embattled developer Daniele Sestagalli took to Discord to answer questions from the Wonderland protocol community – a rancorous 45 minutes featuring big promises and bluster, but few specifics on how the project will move forward on leveraging its $325 million treasury to deliver value for tokenholders.  Wonderland, as well as a number of associated decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols loosely united under the “Frog Nation” banner led by Sestagalli, was rocked last week by the revelation from on-chain analyst zachXBT that pseudonymous Wonderland treasurer “Sifu” was in fact Michael Patryn, the co-founder of the fraudulent cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX.  Read more: How Did a Former Quadriga Exec End Up Running a DeFi Protocol? Wonderland Founder Explains  While Patryn has since reportedly been relieved of his duties following a DAO vote on his ouster at a 90-to-10 margin – and, as of Tuesday morning, has moved $2.8 million worth of ether (ETH) from his publicly known address to privacy mixer Tornado Cash – the question remains of what to do with Wonderland’s treasury.  Wonderland’s TIME token currently has a market capitalization of $320 million, just below the $325 million in its coffers.  While some holders are advocating dissolving the project by allowing token holders to redeem their TIME for a proportional share of the protocol’s assets, most investors bought at a valuation many multiples above the current treasury, prompting others to push for an outcome that could pump prices once more.  In Discord chats on Monday, Sestagalli – who indicated over the weekend his desire to see the project dissolved – vowed to push forward in an effort to help users.  “What we need to do is to find a PLAN to get the frogs back on their feet,” he wrote in a string of messages emblematic of his erratic, populist communications style.  So far that plan is beginning to take shape in a handful of current and former proposals from across Frog Nation, none of which so far have garnered popular support among the largely disgruntled investor community.  TIME’s up  Sestagalli founded Wonderland in September. A fork of Olympus DAO – a notorious, sky-high APY rebasing project frequently lambasted as unsustainable – Sestagalli initially envisioned Wonderland as a perpetual, “mega-ICO,” distributing tokens to holders over time and building a treasury, according to a November interview.  At the time Sestagalli was aiming to eventually leverage TIME as an in-game currency for a wide range of games, including a role-playing game (RPG) Sestagalli said was under development in 2021.  Since then the vision has expanded for the treasury to become a community-owned investment fund, mirroring a strategy from Redacted Cartel and others that use Olympus’ tokennomics to bootstrap deposits for the fund.  Indeed, as Wonderland eventually overtook Olympus in market capitalization and treasury size, Sestagalli and Patryn made seed investments into a number of projects and grew notorious for large, unilateral investments. Sestagalli in particular popularized a narrative where the Frog Nation investors would eventually compete with and replace “the suits” – shorthand for traditional investment funds.  However, the Olympus model has come under fire in recent weeks amid a crippling drawdown in both the original project and its various forks. In the days prior to Sifu’s unmasking as Patryn, Wonderland fell by as much as 40% in a 24-hour period, dropping as far as 95% off its highs.  Read more: Wonderland’s TIME Sets Low of $420 After Liquidation Cascade  The already anemic price action took another hit with Patryn’s revealing. In an interview with CoinDesk, Sestagalli said he had known Patryn’s identity for a number of weeks but chose to continue working with him anyway, a dynamic that has led to a crisis in confidence from investors.  Community split  Despite the project’s founder actively choosing to work with a convicted felon, on Monday a vote to end Wonderland’s operations and disburse the treasury to investors failed to pass – a sign that either token holders still have faith is Sestagalli’s ability to turn things around, or they’re reluctant to book their losses.  The failed vote was controversial from the outset.  Depending on the particular decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), the outcome of votes may programmatically and automatically prompt actions on-chain, altering the code for a protocol or leading to treasury disbursements, among other functionalities.  In Wonderland’s case, however, the protocol’s rarely-invoked DAO has hosted a total of just eight votes, and the outcomes of votes are merely signals of the community’s desires – desires that the Wonderland team can then hypothetically choose whether or not to enact.  This dynamic led to tensions over the weekend, as a tweet from Sestagalli seemed to indicate Wonderland would be shutting down regardless of the outcome of the “Wind down Wonderland” vote:  On Monday, however, the vote concluded with 55% of the token weight in favor of the project carrying on. With over 22,000 addresses voting, it was perhaps the most active governance proposal in history, with the vast majority of individual addresses voting to continue the project, outpacing a much smaller number of “whales,” who control large sums of tokens, voting to cease operations.  Sestagalli, in turn, backtracked on unilaterally closing shop, writing in Discord that the team was taking time to “compile suggestions, and determine the best path forward.”  “We understand that there is still [the] will to continue, the community wants to make it. Unwinding for many of you means taking a loss and you don’t know what to do next. You believed in me and you want to keep [invested] in me,” he wrote.  He added that the protocol was looking to hire a communications team, and the DAO would be “managed now by me Directly” in future.  While it might seem absurd to outsiders that the majority of voters would vote to continue, in the Discord multiple users are expressing support for carrying the project on, either supporting “Dani’s vision” or saying that, due to their losses on TIME, they are in effect trapped.  In the absence of any action from law enforcement or regulatory authorities, the experiment now appears poised to move forward.  In an interview with CoinDesk on Monday, Sestagalli said he was not worried about whether Patryn’s former involvement and the structure of the Wonderland fund could prompt regulatory action.  “It should worry everyone because most DeFi is like this,” he said. “I can worry or find solutions.”  Competing proposals  At least in theory what happens next is up to the DAO, and there are a number of options being discussed.  Prior to Patryn’s reveal last week, the team for Abracadabra – an affiliated asset-backed stablecoin protocol – proposed acquiring Wonderland’s treasury.  Similar to the xDAI and Gnosis merger or the Rari Capital and Fei merger, this would include a token swap that would allow users to exchange TIME for Abracadabra’s SPELL, hypothetically allowing TIME holders upside in the joint venture – a key goal in the proposal, Sestagalli told CoinDesk last week.  While Abracadabra is revenue-generating and its MIM stablecoin is among the most popular in DeFi, MIM briefly lost its peg last week amid the uproar, and efforts from the protocol to bribe its way onto the Aave lending platform now may be at risk.  Read more: DeFi Users Fret ‘Contagion’ Risk Amid Possible Stablecoin Depegging  Additionally, a number of proposals have emerged on the Wonderland governance forums to keep the treasury independent while replacing Sifu with another asset manager.  While no one proposal has yet gained traction, Sestagalli says that unlike in the past, he’ll be moving forward carefully.  “I need to slow down and listen to the community,” he said.  While the deliberations carry on, however, many in the DeFi community have bemoaned the ongoing saga – which now shows no sign of ending – as a black eye for the industry.  “Are we done giving people 9 figure treasuries with no strings attached and pretending [it’s] DeFi?” asked popular analyst and Yearn DAO contributor Ryan Watkins on Twitter. “This is the type of behavior I’m excited to get rid of in a bear market.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/01/wonderland-founder-im-here-to-fix-this-and-make-it-all-back,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00cb422499e11aca8d336d8817f074fc961e19fa-4272x2848.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375371,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7ZvF,1643724043,‘Pay’ Product Looks to Boost Stablecoin Payments on Solana,"Cryptocurrency’s original use case – payments – is getting a boost on the Solana blockchain.  New software co-developed by Solana Labs intends to help merchants accept crypto payments over the Solana network. Checkout.com, Circle and Citcon are supporting “Solana Pay,” which debuted Tuesday with integrations with crypto exchange FTX and ecosystem wallets Phantom and Slope.  The software development kit (SDK) takes crypto in and spits crypto out. Obvious, maybe – but a notable difference from some of the market’s better-known crypto-to-fiat rails. Virtually every merchant paid with a “crypto credit card” sees their payments settled in cash.  Crypto payments have been central to the industry since the Bitcoin white paper touted “peer-to-peer electronic cash” over a decade ago. But a mix of price volatility, slow on-chain settlement and tax headaches hampered growth, said Sheraz Shere, head of payments for Solana Labs.  “Now that we have a blockchain that has the throughput, speed and scalability and low fees of traditional payment networks – 50,000 transactions per second and sub-second transfer times, we can potentially build a merchant payment system that's truly on the blockchain, and most importantly, that's peer-to-peer and decentralized and permissionless,” Shere said.  USDC booster  Technically any SPL token can flow through Solana Pay. But the protocol’s backers are particularly keen on payments in Solana-native USDC.  The ecosystem already has $4 billion of Circle’s dollar-pegged stablecoin sloshing about, a figure second only to Ethereum in size.  Read more: USDC Is Coming to Solana Blockchain in Potential Boost for Non-Ethereum DeFi  A non-custodial service, the open-source package, which Shere said anyone could implement, does not take a slice of payments. Customers will still have to pay network fees; on Solana, that’s well below 1/100th of a penny.  The state of play for merchants is only a tad more complicated. Plugging into Solana Pay through a third-party like Checkout.com, they might pay a minimal service charge. They could set it up themselves for zero fees, he said.  Customer payments are only the start, Shere said. He’s “thinking about a future where stablecoins like USDC are the transactional currency,” underpinning everything from payroll to invoices.  That said, Solana has seen its fair share of hiccups lately. Continued network slowdowns could set back the stated vision, though a spokesperson for Solana Labs said that USDC transfers are simple to execute and unlikely to add stress.",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | SOL | TECHNOLOGY | USDC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/01/pay-product-looks-to-boost-stablecoin-payments-on-solana,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8a5d0eaa715b89355a3a60d25c47c5b05e005bb-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375375,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7a0H,1643724000,Launch House Raises $12M Series A for New Age Hacker Houses,"Launch House, a revamped version of a Silicon Valley hacker house, closed a $12 million Series A funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).  Other investors in the round included Michael Ovitz, co-founder of Creative Arts Agency; Mike Dudas, investor at 6th Man Ventures and founder of The Block; and Ryan Sean Adams, co-host of crypto podcast ""Bankless.""  In a press release on Tuesday, a16z general partner Andrew Chen cited remote work, the rise of Gen Z and trends in startup fundraising as factors propelling Launch House into ""the third space for the new distributed Silicon Valley,"" alongside long-standing institutions such as universities and incubator programs.  With the funding, Launch House plans to expand its residency program to additional cities around the globe and grow its metaverse location.  The Launch House story  When Launch House co-founder Michael Houck was laid off from Airbnb during the coronavirus pandemic, he booked a flight to Tulum, Mexico, and moved into a rental house with his friends (ironically, in an Airbnb).  The purpose was twofold: live with friends and launch startups.  The experiment was a nod to old-school Silicon Valley hacker houses - communal living spaces occupied by groups of aspiring entrepreneurs.  ""The goal was to recreate Silicon Valley magic,"" Houck told CoinDesk, who noted that Web 2 unicorns such as Airbnb and Snapchat were both launched via hacker houses. ""Pretty soon, people were hitting us up to join.""  But instead of a startup, Houck and co-founder Brett Goldstein realized they would build a startup for startups: Launch House.  Launch House is a revamped version of the hacker house. Aspiring entrepreneurs apply to one of several month-long ""residency programs"" with themes including ""Web 3,"" ""metavase"" or ""female founders.""  Upon acceptance, applicants are invited to live in often-swanky digs, located in either New York City or Los Angeles. Launch House also supports virtual cohorts that take place via Gather, an interactive virtual space.  ""The definition of Silicon Valley is changing,"" Goldstein told CoinDesk via a video call. ""All that kind of 'that’s what silicon valley is' has basically died after COVID. We think the new Silicon Valley is distributed.""  If the Launch House ethos seems like a familiar theme, it’s because it is merging the community-driven nature of DAOs like Friends With Benefits with the entrepreneurial focus of accelerators like Y Combinator.  ""Critics of DAOs say they’re extremely disorganized and over indexed on Web 3 primitives,"" said Goldstein. ""We believe in a decentralized future for Launch House. But instead of Greek city states, we’re trying to build UC Berkeley.""  ""Outside of a16z, we wanted to index crypto media,"" Goldstein said of Launch House's investors. ""One big initiative is a media operation that is Web 3 forward, but more rationally optimistic.""  So far, the most successful startup to come out of Launch House is Showtime, a non-fungible token (NFT) platform that allows users to display their NFT collection - it’s like Instagram, but for NFTs.  In a world that is increasingly moving towards remote work and virtual metaverses, Launch House is also a bet on the benefits of in-person collaboration.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/01/launch-house-raises-12m-series-a-for-new-age-hacker-houses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10b029c6905b5895d27aa3d693e55f025f2be880-1716x944.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The specific path to a listing is still being worked out, Khazaradze told CoinDesk, but the firm is considering a series of options, including a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) or reverse merger with an already public company, he said.  While other crypto firms – led by Coinbase and including Bakkt and others – took to the public markets in 2021, a non-exchange going public is still rare in the world of digital assets (save for a bumper crop of bitcoin mining firms).  Founded in 2017, the Aurox trading terminal was launched in September 2020 and has gathered some 60,000 users to date, all done on an entirely self-funded basis, eschewing VC involvement, Khazaradze added. Neither has the platform completed any pre-sales of the Aurox token (URUS), launched in February 2021.  “One of the issues is that since we self-funded everything, we’re competing against companies that are raising $20 million at the drop of a hat,” said Khazaradze. “But we don’t want to go that route.”  Khazaradze said advisers to the firm have suggested a Nasdaq listing, and there are a couple of options when it comes to pursuing that.  “We’re hoping to be public by 2022.

42375363,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7ZmR,1643721467,MicroStrategy Buys Additional $25M Worth of Bitcoin During Market Dip,"MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR), the business-intelligence software company that has taken to accumulating bitcoin, said it bought approximately 660bitcoins for around $25 million between Dec. 30, 2021, and Jan. 31, 2022.  The company paid an average price of $37,865 per bitcoin, it said in a statement.  The 660 BTC acquired across the 32-day period equates to an average of 21 a day. That's a markedly lower rate than in December, when the firm bought 1,914 in the 20 days ended Dec. 29 – an average of 96 a day – and that was itself slower than the 1,434 bitcoin it bought in the first nine days of the month.  The slowdown may point to MicroStrategy exercising greater caution in its bitcoin acquisitions given the market's recent downturn. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization hit a record high near $69,000 in November and is now trading around $39,000.  Tysons Corner, Va.-based MicroStrategy now holds a total of 125,051 bitcoins, valued at about $4.8 billion at the current bitcoin price of $38,700.  Shares of MicroStrategy have fallen around 34% over the last month.  CEO Michael Saylor has been insistent that the company has no plans to sell its bitcoin holdings and is invested the long term.

The stablecoin landscape is ever-changing, but one trend has emerged in the last year or so: Tether&apos;s dominance is waning.

42375366,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7ZqD,1643720145,Terra Founder Floats $38M Proposal for American Sports League Deal,"Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon floated a funding proposal for $38.5 million from the Terra community treasury to sponsor a major American sports league team he didn't name. The funding would be in the form of TerraUSD (UST) stablecoins, or tokens pegged on a 1:1 basis with U.S. dollars.  “This proposal involves a legendary sports franchise and a household name in one of the major four American professional sports leagues – the NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB,” Kwon said on Tuesday. “For legal reasons, we cannot reveal the identity of the franchise until after the voting period has concluded and the partnership agreement is settled.”  The National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), National Hockey League (NHL), and Major League Baseball (MLB) are four of the biggest sports leagues in the world. They together attract billions of dollars in advertising revenue each year and offer some of the most-watched sporting events.  The Community Pool of Singapore-based Terra is one of the largest decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) in the crypto industry, with over $2.74 billion in assets.  A DAO is a blockchain-based organization often governed by its native crypto token. Holders collectively vote on decisions to determine the DAO’s future, unlike traditional companies where decisions are taken by an elected board.  How will the money be spent?  According to Kwon’s proposal, the deal would help fund a five-year exclusive partnership to promote the Terra brand across the franchise’s home venue and its television network.  Under the terms of the agreement, the community pool will pay the full amount upon execution of the deal. This represents annual fees of $7.50 million a year for five years and $650,000 to cover construction, renovation and redesign costs.  If the proposal is passed by the Terra community, the funds will be distributed to a multi-signature (multisig) wallet controlled by a newly formed Terra Community Trust (TCT).  The Terra DAO is the direct beneficiary of this wallet and would have three trustees: 1. Delphi Labs General Counsel Gabriel Shapiro, RealVision co-founder Remi Tetot, and Draft Kings board member Ryan Moore.  “The delivery of funds to the TCT and eventually the sports franchise will be executed via a UST to [U.S. dollar over-the-counter] deal with a leading and well-reputed trading firm,” Kwon said in the proposal.  While Terra’s proposal could make it one of the first instances of a DAO funding a sporting partnership, several crypto companies have turned to sports companies as a means of promotion. Such funding has crossed $1 billion in the past year.  Crypto services firm Crypto.com leads the list. In the past year, the firm inked a $700 million agreement to rename the iconic Staples Center in Los Angeles to Crypto.com Arena, struck a $100 million deal with Formula 1, announced a three-year partnership with soccer's Paris Saint-Germain, and became the official jersey patch sponsor of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team.  Crypto exchange FTX also has multiple partnerships. In the past year, the Bahamas-based crypto exchange purchased the naming rights to esports giant TSM in June for $210 million, secured a 19-year deal with Miami Heat, a five-year partnership with MLB, and secured the naming rights to UC Berkeley’s football stadium.

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.  Both these U.K. firms have collaborated in the past, exploring ways their respective infrastructure plays could connect. On the LAB577 side, the Digital Asset Shared Ledger brought bitcoin and ether onto the permissioned Corda Network, which was further facilitated by the BCB Liquidity Interchange Network Consortium, a kind of SWIFT alternative for instant crypto-cash settlement.  “We’ve taken different angles in building infrastructure,” said BCB chief Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie in an interview. “BCB has focused on the bottom payments layer, alongside the liquidity, banking and trading. While LAB557’s infrastructure focus has been looking ahead at the future of securities and that of interoperability among blockchains.”  Read more: BCB Group Expands in Europe With Acquisition of 100-Year-Old German Bank  Back in December, BCB acquired Germany’s 100-year-old Sutor Bank, a deal that’s expected to gain approval from the German regulator BaFin later this month.

42375374,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7Zz1,1643704285,GameFi Faces Regulatory Headwinds in Major Asian Markets,"In the first few weeks of the year, a considerable amount of capital was allocated to investment pools looking for the next big thing in GameFi – the collision of crypto and gaming. In January, FTX established a $2 billion fund to target gaming; shortly after, Singapore’s Crypto.com Ventures upped its $200 million fund to $500 million saying that gaming was one of the investment themes on which it planned to double down.  This enthusiasm crypto investors have for gaming is matched by executives at some of the gaming industry’s largest incumbents. Leadership at EA and Ubisoft have both said that blockchain technology, as well as non-fungible tokens (NFT), represent the future of gaming.  While mainstream crypto gaming has already had the challenge of lukewarm consumer interest, the industry faces an even greater challenge in some of the most important markets in Asia: a strict regulatory framework.  Laws already on the books  Usually, with crypto there’s an element of regulatory fog. However, with crypto gaming specifically, there are laws about monetizing game tokens already on the books in South Korea, Japan and China – and in some cases, they are nearly 20 years old.  Oleg Smagin, a senior crypto finance manager at Seoul-based Post Voyager, a GameFi service developer, points to Article 32 of Korea’s Gaming Industry Promotion Act as a potential problem. It specifically bans game currency from being converted into cash.  “The interesting part is that this article had been there long before the P2E [play-to-earn] and blockchain were born. It was added in 2004 when hundreds of thousands of Koreans were fanatically playing a notorious arcade game called ‘Seatalk’ (바다이야기),” Smagin told CoinDesk. “You could earn coupons in the game that could be turned into cash at almost every corner. The game became so popular that the government considered it a dangerous form of gambling.”  Smagin said the law has stayed on the books for nearly two years, and is being used to block the distribution of play-to-earn games like Axie Infinity. “For the regulator, Axie is no different from Seatalk as you can go to an exchange and easily exchange your tokens earned in the game into cash,” he said.  Korea has a form of soft web censoring, mostly blocking pornography and what the state deems illegal or subversive materials, but Axie Infinity is still accessible online.  However, play-to-earn games cannot be distributed through existing digital or retail channels in the country such as mobile app stores, which is sure to be a non-starter for larger game developers.  Megan Huang, a research fellow at International Cyber Law at Korea University and a director at Delio, said the Korean Game Rating and Administration Committee has already blocked the distribution of play-to-earn games Infinite Breakthrough and Three Kingdoms Reverse from mobile app stores by withholding their rating classification.  “[The regulator] has sent an official request to Apple and Google asking them to block further registration of play-to-earn games from their app stores,” she said.  Huang also points to Article 28 of the Gaming Industry Promotion Act as being problematic for the emergent industry as it prohibits speculative acts, gambling and free gifts.  But for web-based games, there’s always a question as to how effective any sort of ban can be. Huang said many Korean gamers are already using virtual private networks (VPN) to access play-to-earn games, which would bypass any sort of country-wide block entirely.  Japan might call it gambling  Over in Japan, play-to-earn is on rocky grounds, not because of specific laws about gaming but because most of the in-game actions would likely be considered gambling.  In a September post, Tokyo-based law firm So & Sato said that based on its analysis, the core functions of Axie Infinity’s gameplay would be considered either illegal gambling, or regulated under the Japanese Fair Trade Commission's Improper Premiums and Misleading Representations Act.  “Since a user must pay a certain amount of smooth love potion [or SLP, an in-game token] to breed new randomly generated Axies, there is a possibility that the breeding of new Axies is considered illegal gambling,” the firm wrote. The game’s tournaments, which require an entry fee, would also fall under this category.  So & Sato also point to the game’s farming mechanism as something that would be regulated by Japan’s Consumer Affairs Agency’s Improper Premiums and Misleading Representations Act (IPMR).  “The IPMR provides limits for items and other assets that can be given away for ‘free.’ In the case of play-to-earn models where players must make an initial investment to play the game,” the firm writes.  China bans it all  China, one of the biggest markets for gaming, definitely has the steepest prohibition on GameFi. And like Korea, part of the framework has already been on the books for some time.  In the mid-2000s, Tencent developed a virtual currency called QQ Coins, Jason Hu, head of market at Shenzhen-based non-fungible token (NFT) project Prota-1, explained to CoinDesk. These coins were pegged to the value of the Chinese yuan and could be exchanged for cash or other physical goods. They lasted for around a decade before the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the nation’s central bank, banned them in 2007.  “Any gaming element that’s transferable to the CNY [yuan] is strictly forbidden. Even a lot of online poker games have been shut down because the token coins can be exchanged for CNY,” he said.  Later, in 2017, the PBoC put a ban on crypto trading entirely eliminating the possibility of GameFi’s entry into China entirely.  Huang said that within China gaming is a licensed activity and developers that want to publish a game in-country must get an Internet Content Provider (ICP) certificate from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) as well as approval from the National Press and Publications Administration.  “GameFi is not fundamentally allowed by Chinese law because it deals with virtual currency businesses such as crypto wallets, exchange, and trading of tokens,” said Huang.  Foreign developers must partner with a domestic publisher, like Tencent, NetEase or JD to publish a game. All of China’s tech giants have signed a self-regulatory pledge to prohibit speculation around NFTs.  “[NFT buyers] can only collect, appreciate and display purchased NFT digital collections which makes the NFT markets in China is completely different from those in overseas market,” Huang said.  Hu adds Chinese media have been encouraged to use the term “digital collectibles” instead of NFTs and are discouraged from talking about tokens.  Even though China’s strict regulatory framework means GameFi will never take off in the country, Hu isn’t deterred. He sees China as being a “factory” for gaming and the upcoming metaverse.  “There’s strong development talent in China,” he said, pointing to the number of schools and even non-degree coding bootcamps to train people for the industry.  “I imagine the future of gaming startups where the marketing and design teams are in the U.S., but the engineers are in China,” he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | AXS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/01/gamefi-faces-regulatory-headwinds-in-major-asian-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a0543a2aa1a7793827e4f1e7f9a044b128f2fe6a-1339x821.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Funds from this hack have been slowly laundered for over five years now and cashing-out large volumes over a short period of time would draw unwanted attention,"" Elliptic said.  The number of bitcoin transferred amounted to 79% of the total 119,756 bitcoins drained from Bitfinex in 2016, one of the biggest bitcoin hacks to date.  Twitter account WhaleAlert had earlier reported on this development, saying that someone transferred 10,000 bitcoins worth more than $383 million to an unknown wallet during Asian hours on Tuesday.  Unidentified parties last moved the stolen bitcoin in April 2021, transferring over $700 million worth of coins to unknown wallets during the bull frenzy brought on by crypto exchange Coinbase's then impending listing on Nasdaq. According to Elliptic, the funds were laundered through darknet markets like Hydra and privacy-focused Wasabi wallet.  Igor Data, CEO of Geneva-based BLIN Analytics, said Hydra and Wasabi might be used again.  ""Hydra breaks the link between the incident and further transactions, and Wasabi Wallet provides the necessary level of anonymization, including the ability to hide the connection not only to Bitfinex Hack but also to Hydra,"" Data said in a LinkedIn chat. ""The hackers obviously use the automation tools to reduce the chance of error, which could lead to the hackers being caught.""  A movement of malicious funds usually raises suspicion of bad actors looking to cash out and spooks markets.  As noted in April, most of the bitcoin associated with the Bitfinex hack is widely tracked and blacklisted. Thus, bad actors would have a tough time cashing out on prominent centralized exchanges.  In other words, the latest movement of the hacked coins presents little downside risk to bitcoin. At press time, the cryptocurrency was trading largely unchanged on the day near $38,500.

42423789,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2gejh,1643701262,"India Edges Toward Crypto Legalization With 30% Tax, Announces Digital Rupee","Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a 30% tax on any income from the transfer of virtual digital assets, a first for the nation.  Sitharaman also said that the digital rupee will most likely be issued in the 2022-2023 time frame, which is the first time the Indian government has given a timeline on the launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  ""There has been a phenomenal increase in transaction in virtual digital assets. The magnitude and frequency of these transactions have made it imperative to provide for a specific tax regime,"" Sitharaman said in the Indian budget speech, which lasted for over two hours.  Speaking on the adoption of CBDCs, Sitharaman said that a ""digital rupee"" will be ""issued using blockchain and other technologies; to be issued by RBI starting 2022-23. This will give a big boost to the economy.""  When asked later on about taxing crypto transactions without a regulation, the finance minister said, ""We have circulated a paper, inputs are coming in, public stakeholders are coming in so regulation goes through that process. I don't wait till regulation comes into place taxing people who are earning profits. Can I?""  The words crypto or cryptocurrency weren't used in the budget speech. However, the finance minister used the phrase ""virtual digital asset,"" which the industry interprets as a term for cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The naming and the steps taken doesn't mean crypto is now legal, but the industry views the moves as steps toward giving cryptocurrencies legitimacy.  ""India is finally on the path to legitimizing the crypto sector in India,"" said Nischal Shetty, co-founder and CEO of WazirX, one of India’s largest crypto exchanges.  Shetty said the move to launch a blockchain-powered digital rupee is ""phenomenal"" as it will ""pave the way for crypto adoption."" He said the ""biggest development"" was the ""clarity on crypto taxation, which will add the much-needed recognition to the crypto ecosystem of India.""  Sumit Gupta, co-founder and CEO of CoinDCX, called the budget ""forward-looking and inspirational,"" adding that taxing crypto transfers is a ""step in the right direction.""  Sidharth Sogani, founder and CEO of cryptocurrency research organization Crebaco, said, ""You can't tax something which is illegal. Hence, this is a very positive move by the government and is very good for the industry. If there are tax clarities in this space, more money is likely to come in.""  Could crypto tax push away retail investors?  The concern among some experts is that the 30% tax could deter retail investors.  ""There might be movement in people liquidating their crypto portfolios and moving to the equity market. The 30% tax is too much,"" said a source at a major crypto exchange who wished not to be named.  Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, disagrees, saying, ""It (the tax) is normal and not too high"" and is in line with normal taxation in which ""if you are earning personal income of more than 12 lakh per annum, then you are in the 30% slab anyway.""  Another industry source who didn't wish to be named highlighted a contradiction in the government's statements. In the past, the government has said it seeks to prohibit all cryptocurrencies in India but will allow certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology.  ""How will you promote the underlying technology with a 30% tax?"" asked the industry source from a major exchange.  ""Prima facie, self-declaration of crypto ownership and tax filing is a progressive move that displays the government's conviction in monitoring, validating, and regulating the evolution of crypto economy,"" Gaurav Mehta, founder of Catax, a one-stop-shop for crypto taxes, blockchain auditing and forensics, said.  The Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank, had earlier indicated launching a pilot CBDC project in the fiscal year April 2022 to March 2023.  India's crypto industry had several demands, including that the government classify cryptocurrencies, provide clarity on taxation and establish a self-regulatory framework shaped by the crypto industry.  The country appears to be waiting for global consensus on crypto regulation. Earlier this year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called for global cooperation on cryptocurrencies. Modi said that challenges like crypto cannot be tackled by nations in isolation.  Last year, Sitharaman told Parliament that “a new [cryptocurrencies] bill is in the works,” warning that “the risk of cryptocurrency and it going in the wrong hands is being monitored.”  Read more: India's Crypto Industry Awaits New Budget  UPDATE (Feb. 1, 10:04 UTC): Updates headline, adds reaction from industry experts and adds additional background.

The crypto exchange said on Monday it would list ORCA and FIDA, tokens of Solana-based decentralized exchanges Orca and Bonfida respectively, as reported.  The move marked the first time non-Ethereum assets were listed on Coinbase. It previously listed only tokens built atop the Ethereum blockchain or the native tokens of blockchains, such as Avalanche (AVAX) and Solana.  SOL prices surged to over $106 during Asian morning hours on Tuesday from $90 on Monday morning. SOL traded at over $175 at the start of January, but fell to $82 last week amid a broader market decline.  Prices bounced from the $88-$90 support level, which acted as a major area for buyers last week. SOL previously failed to break the $100 resistance level in January.  Relative strength index (RSI) readings, however, reached overbought levels of over 70, indicating a brief correction could soon occur. RSI is a price-chart indicator that determines the magnitude of price changes over a time period.  Another catalyst supporting the price move was an investment announcement by Phantom, Solana’s most used and well-known blockchain wallet.

42423785,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2geVh,1643693771,Bitcoin Steady Near $38.5K as Australian Central Bank Ends Easing Program,"The price of bitcoin held steady early Tuesday after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) terminated its liquidity-boosting bond purchase program, also known as quantitative easing (QE), and tamed rate hike fears.  The Australian central bank announced an end of the weekly A$4 billion ($2.8 billion) in government bond purchases and maintained the benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.1%. Most economists had predicted an end of the QE, with the jobless rate dipping to a 13-year low of 4.2% and core inflation surging to seven-year highs of 2.6%.  RBA's decision to end QE comes on the heels of markets pricing an aggressive tightening cycle in the U.S. Last Wednesday, the Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to end its bond purchases in March and set the stage for a rate hike in the same month. Markets are now priced for five quarter percentage point Fed rate hikes by the end of the year.  While the RBA followed the Fed's lead on ending QE, the Australian central bank pushed back against rate hike expectations. ""Ceasing purchases under the bond purchase program does not imply a near-term increase in interest rates,"" Governor Philip Lowe said in a statement. ""The board is prepared to be patient as it monitors how the various factors affecting inflation in Australia evolve.""  Ahead of the decision, markets were expecting a rate hike in May, followed by another four hikes by December.  RBA's dovish tone weighed over the Aussie dollar, sending AUD/USD down 50 percentage points (pips) towards 0.70 and perhaps helping bitcoin and other risk assets maintain overnight gains.  The top cryptocurrency by market cap traded largely unchanged on the day, changing hands at about $38,560 at 04:55 UTC. It rose 1.5% on Monday. Australia's benchmark equity index, S&P ASX 200, traded 0.5% higher, while the futures tied to the S&P 500 futures dropped 0.2%.  Bitcoin has nearly halved in value since peaking at nearly $69,000 on Nov. 10, predominantly because of fears of faster Fed tightening. The cryptocurrency's fortunes are closely tied with the equity markets, with the 60-day correlation between the two assets now at 65% versus virtually zero in 2017. The sensitivity to stock market gyrations and macro factors like central bank decisions perhaps stems from increased institutional participation. Besides, bitcoin has been one of the inflation trades.  ""Bitcoin is best understood as a monetary good, and one of the primary investment theses for bitcoin is as the store of value asset in an increasingly digital world,"" Fidelity Digital Assets' analysts wrote in their monthly note.  While macro factors appear to have aligned in favor of the bears, on-chain activity paints a positive picture.

42423786,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2gebh,1643685602,"Anchorage Closes In on FDIC Crypto Custodian Deal, Documents Show","Digital assets are growing more commonplace on the balance sheet of banks in the U.S. Eventually, one of these institutions may fail, and the Federal Insurance Deposit Corp. (FDIC) will need to step in to clean things up.  Cue Anchorage, a digital assets custodian and the first crypto startup to receive a trust charter from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency. According to documents obtained by filing a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the bank is in the final stages of bidding for a contract with the FDIC to act as a crypto asset management and solution provider.  CoinDesk’s FOIA request sought all crypto custodian-related records from the federal agency. Anchorage is the only company mentioned in the documents, implying no other company is in the running to provide storage and disposal services for the FDIC.  While the document lists an award date of Sept. 8, 2021, a government website tracking agency spending seems to indicate that no contracts were awarded in 2021 or so far in 2022.  The FDIC is a federal banking regulator in the U.S. tasked with providing deposit insurance for national banks. If one of these banks fails, its customers’ deposits are protected by up to $250,000 in insurance per account.  Anchorage declined to comment on the potential contract or how it will provide this service. Decrypt first reported in September that the commission was nearing a deal with Anchorage for these services.  The document is signed by Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley and FDIC contracting officer Kervin Dupart.  Regulatory requirements  According to the FOIA response, the deal would be worth $1.5 million over three years with an option in place to extend it for another two years. The deal would have Anchorage act as a contractor for FDIC-R, the FDIC’s receivership arm, in order to minimize losses for the deposit insurance fund by quickly realizing and liquidating the value of assets in receivership.  Anchorage would also be required to build for the FDIC a “crypto asset information list,” which outlines what assets are being held by an institution, their value and any third-party usage of the asset such as being used as collateral for a loan via a smart contract.  The FDIC doesn't cover digital assets. Individuals familiar with the agency’s thinking told CoinDesk in October that it had begun studying deposit insurance for stablecoins – specifically, pass-through insurance for stablecoin issuers that hold their dollar reserves in banks.  According to the document, Anchorage will be required to hold digital assets in cold storage, with private keys completely firewalled from local or external networks.  Anchorage will have to report the inventory, cash collections, inventory changes, in-progress settlements, “crypto assets held for others” and other information to the FDIC every month, as well as additional reports requested on an ad hoc basis.  Anchorage could also be required to convert its digital assets to U.S. dollars or return them to third parties as needed.  21-0287 - Redacted Responsive Document by Sam Reynolds on Scribd  Offering deposits  Recently, fintech firm Milo announced that it plans to offer mortgages collateralized with bitcoin in the near future. At this point, Milo doesn't have FDIC insurance, though it isn’t required to because it is a nonbank entity. Should this effort on Milo’s part be successful, it's likely that other banks and institutions would take note and attempt their own offering.  Crypto lender Ledn has signaled that it's working on a similar product. Another firm, United Wholesale Mortgage, which is the second-largest mortgage lender in the U.S., began offering crypto mortgages in mid-2021 but canceled the initiative in October, citing low demand.  While U.S. banks have begun to slowly offer crypto services to their wealthiest clients after the OCC gave them the green light in October 2020, most crypto owned by retail investors is held on exchanges. Crypto lender Figure, an aspiring federal bank, recently modified its application for a national charter to note that it would offer FDIC-insured accounts.  It’s yet to be seen if these exchanges are interested in FDIC insurance, though many have obtained custodian licenses, which include their own form of insurance.  Anchorage and other digital assets banks don't have FDIC insurance on their own deposits.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,"Sam Reynolds, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/01/anchorage-closes-in-on-fdic-crypto-custodian-deal-documents-show,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de9263e2c528788f9c16691e88a8a01579864cad-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394311,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbW5f,1643682733,Crypto Twitter’s Misdirected Furor Didn’t Fix the Travel Rule,"Hardware wallet maker Trezor announced last Thursday it had adopted software that makes it easier for Switzerland residents to withdraw crypto from a regulated exchange to their own wallet – then reversed course a day later. So what happened?  Within moments of the first story breaking, a Crypto Twitter storm-in-a-teacup was brewing. Some argued that Trezor’s decision to adopt the Address Ownership Proof Protocol (AOPP) was legitimizing wallet verification and facilitating creeping regulatory overreach, signaling a decay of the crypto community’s freedom.  But if you’ve ever had to transact with a Swiss crypto exchange, you probably breathed a sigh of relief upon reading the news, because getting your crypto off a Swiss exchange is a pain in the bum.  Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist, is the director of Emfarsis, a consulting firm based in Southeast Asia. The views expressed here are her own.  If you live in Switzerland, you must prove you are the owner of the wallet that you want to pull your funds to. You can do that in a few different ways, but mostly, users will submit a screenshot of their wallet, or the exchange will conduct a “Satoshi test,” where they send a specific amount of coins to a wallet and ask the user to confirm receipt. Some wallet providers, like Trezor, have an in-built sign-and-verify feature that allows a user to sign a text message using their wallet keys, which someone else can then verify using the address.  This manual process is clunky and annoying. The screenshot option is also a security attack vector; what crypto user wants to associate their phone number with their wallet address?!  As for the Satoshi test, not only does it incur transaction fees, it’s slow and involves too many steps to get done. If you’ve ever worked in tech, you’ll know that streamlining on-boarding is imperative to user adoption and adding more clicks is suicide for any app.  Read more: Few Crypto Firms Even Trying to Comply With FATF's ‘Travel Rule’  But, hey, those are the rules in Switzerland. There’s no way around it. If you want to withdraw from the exchange into your private, un-hosted, self-hosted, non-custodial (whatever you want to call it) wallet, you have to prove it's yours. Once it’s in your wallet, you can send it wherever you please.  Travel rule: Ineffective, intrusive, inescapable  The whole thing is ludicrous. So why do it? Because FINMA (the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority) took a staunch position on a set of global rules handed down by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) back in 2019, for the purpose of stopping bad guys – money launderers, terrorists, etc. – from moving money around the world to fund their operations.  The travel rule, as it’s known, requires information to be shared about both sender and receiver on either side of a transaction. Banks have had to comply with it for decades, which is how we know it’s not exactly a “tried and tested” crime-stopper, since the vast majority of dirty money still siphons through the world’s traditional financial institutions.  The travel rule is largely ineffective, costly to comply with and encroaching on user privacy. So you can imagine how irate the crypto community was when they heard that they were being saddled with it too, particularly because crypto works entirely differently than the banking system. Applying the travel rule to blockchain is like taking something that was built for a horse and cart and retrofitting it to a rocket ship. Nevertheless, the FATF took its square-peg rule and jammed it in crypto’s round hole.  The travel rule is largely ineffective, costly to comply with, and encroaching on user privacy.  Most FATF member countries are taking their time to interpret and implement their legislative take on the travel rule, but others raced to get it done. Like Switzerland. But Switzerland didn’t just adopt the rule. Oh, no. It went further, to “gold plate” it, meaning everyday people would have to reveal more about themselves and do more to confirm their existence, just to access their local crypto services. Why did FINMA do that? I don’t know. It wasn’t necessary. Perhaps the regulator wanted a gold star from the FATF?  It’s onerous regulations like FINMA’s that can help to accelerate peer-to-peer wallet usage and increase consumer demand for self-sovereign solutions. By making it super-difficult to interact with regulated exchanges, FINMA incentivizes the un-hosted crypto usage that it wanted to prevent. Unintended consequences, much.  So I was excited when I met the founding crew at 21 Analytics, a bunch of OG bitcoiners in Switzerland’s Crypto Valley who’d created a neat little tool, called the AOPP. It is a simple and automated solution for providing proof of ownership of an external wallet's address, solving the issue of having to go through the proof-of-wallet ownership process every time you want to take your crypto off an exchange. It’s opt-in, and open source, so privacy aficionados can personally review the code, should they wish to do so. This is obviously useful for the Swiss, but it might soon be needed by others around the world, too. In the Philippines, for instance, those who earn in crypto via blockchain games are already being asked by their bank to prove the source of their income.  (Disclosure: When AOPP signed Trezor as a partner, my company worked with AOPP to help write the announcement.)  Don’t shoot the mitigator  But the integration announcement prompted unexpected public furor, with some taking to Twitter to voice their objections. In response to the community backlash, bitcoiner Stephan Livera reminded his followers that AOPP wasn't necessarily the source of the issue. Via direct message, Livera told me that he is concerned about non-custodial wallets being stripped of their permissionless quality but “the deeper problem is the FATF and the constant push for more (anti-money-laundering) regulations despite the continual failure of AML policies.”  Read more: Marcus Pleyer - Crypto Firms Can't Outrun the Travel Rule  The frenzy continued, and Trezor capitulated, backtracking on its earlier announcement to confirm it had scrapped its plans to integrate AOPP. Trezor obviously made the decision to remove AOPP from its next release because of the community uproar. But in the grand scheme of things, the rollback changes nothing. As Marek ""Slush"" Palatinus, Trezor’s founder, pointed out in a tweet, Swiss users will still have to prove wallet ownership, unless they are happy to stay trapped inside the confines of Switzerland’s walled garden.  Anti-money laundering requirements such as the travel rule may seem to do little else than force crazy compliance costs on businesses and introduce friction for users, making for a lousy experience. But that is exactly why we need crypto natives working on these issues, to help keep costs down and user satisfaction up, while protecting our dearest-held values of privacy and decentralization.  Crypto is moving fast toward mass adoption and today includes more normies than ever before; I suspect these are the types who expect a certain level of ease and convenience embedded within the user journey, and solutions like AOPP will be welcome.  They’re just less likely to be tweeting about it.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | WALLET,Leah Callon-Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/01/crypto-twitters-misdirected-furor-didnt-fix-the-travel-rule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c456f841f542261cb5a75c5bee350b799765f21-3363x2572.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
