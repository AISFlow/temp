China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has published a new white paper that explores various applications of the technology. Its release this week coincided with a forum on blockchain hosted by the Chinese government aimed at encouraging cooperation among industry stakeholders and members of the country's business community, according to a speech by Ministry Secretary Xie Shaofeng.  The white paper provides a broad overview of the technology and its development both within and beyond China. Specific items include how bitcoin transactions work, for example.  Further, the white paper outlines areas in which standards around blockchain can be formulated to help encourage adoption among mainstream firms, particularly in the finance space. It strikes a progressive tone, suggesting that China faces a major opportunity should the technology mature and become integrated within its business industries.  The Ministry of Industry and IT said in the white paper’s preface (roughly translated):  “[We] hope that all sectors work together to actively grasp the blockchain development trends and regulations...to create a favorable environment for development [and] accelerate the promotion of China's blockchain technology and industrial development.”  A range of industry participants including Ping An Insurance and auto giant Wanxiang – two major firms in China that have been working with the technology – are said to have helped shape the research.  The publication is perhaps a reflection of the technology’s role in China.  Long a hub for bitcoin exchange and miners – the majority of the world’s bitcoin miners are based in the country – a growing number of firms focused on blockchain applications have also emerged. The past year has seen increasing interest among local and state officials as well.  China has also seen the formation of new working groups involving both startups and existing companies like the developer of the popular QQ messaging app.  Image via MIIT",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/10/20/china-pushes-for-blockchain-cooperation-with-new-research-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5272d026e0e2f69b70a653926b996fdda6aa551-1500x1105.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42399419,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj76u,1476982604,ViaBTC Rises: How A Mysterious Miner Could Decide Bitcoin's Future,"Bitcoin's ""most professional mining pool"" has become its most controversial.  Following months of debate over how to scale bitcoin's transaction capacity, the conversation has become newly contentious as progress on much-hyped solutions continue to face the kinds of delays that perhaps should be expected when working with novel technologies.  This lack of progress (real or perceived) has so far most affected bitcoin's business community, many of which are dependent on technical improvements in the network for additional growth. Indeed, while bitcoin's primary development group has its share of detractors, the majority of startups and service providers continue to support Bitcoin Core and its work.  But if one, relatively new bitcoin mining pool has its way, a much anticipated scaling solution could be dead on arrival.  In recent weeks, China's ViaBTC became one of the first providers of mining software to switch its client from the official version provided by Bitcoin Core to an option provided by Bitcoin Unlimited, a rival development group that supports alternative methods of scaling that is focused on creating a more variable bitcoin block size.  But unlike Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Unlimited does not have support for that developer group's signature scaling solution, Segregated Witness, a planned technical fix that would effectively make bitcoin's block size about 1.8 times larger than it is today by changing how information is counted toward this total.  Further, because the rules for Segregated Witness require 95% of bitcoin's hashing power to approve the transition, ViaBTC could effectively block its wider release. According to blockchain.info, over the past 24 hours, ViaBTC has accounted for 7.3% of the blocks discovered, though this has been as high as 9.6% in recent days.  Complicating matters is that despite a consensus of developers suggesting Segregated Witness is the best way to scale bitcoin, ViaBTC remains unconvinced.  In a blog post issued last week, ViaBTC criticized the proposal, suggesting that it would ""fundamentally alter"" the structure of bitcoin transactions.  In interview with CoinDesk, Haipo Yang, the founder and CEO of ViaBTC, said that there was nothing that would change his mind about continuing to support multiple developer groups.  He said:  ""I believe bitcoin needs more development teams and I’ve decided to support Bitcoin Unlimited.""  Big vs small  First discussed in September 2015, Bitcoin Unlimited is a proposal whereby every individual node operator and miner would be able to choose a block size that they prefer rather than having to stick to the 1MB limit enforced by bitcoin's consensus rules. As a result, the argument goes, a kind of block size market will emerge that meets the demands of the network at that time.  The argument set forth by Bitcoin Unlimited is that blocks are beginning to fill up, making it slower for people's transactions to process. In turn, the argument is that fees are rising as well, which is stifling bitcoin adoption and prohibiting user growth.  Changing the bitcoin block size, though, does requires a hard fork, which Bitcoin Core has been resistant to do. Complicating matters is that in a hard fork, two blockchains with different rule sets are created, with bitcoin miners and node operators choosing their preferred option.  If a node does not upgrade to the new software, they are cut off from the network until they upgrade, and if allowed to continue, this new blockchain could even develop into its own self-sustaining network.  Segregated Witness, by contrast, requires only a soft fork, meaning nodes are still a part of bitcoin even if they don't upgrade. They just won't be able to broadcast SegWit transactions.  Bitcoin Core has also taken the approach that bitcoin is simply a settlement layer, and that most of the small transactions should take place on top-layer platforms, such as the in-development Lightning Network.  The Bitcoin Unlimited community, including ViaBTC, disagree with this.  ""Bitcoin is first and foremost a digital currency; its settlement capabilities are secondary to its monetary properties. When bitcoin loses its monetary attributes it thereby loses all utility as a settlement network,"" ViaBTC wrote in its blog post.  And with more than 7% of the total network hashrate, the mining pool can have a significant say in the direction bitcoin goes. Yang also believes that more hashrate will ultimately side with Bitcoin Unlimited.  He said:  ""As far as I can tell, Bitcoin Unlimited is gaining more and more support, or at least interest, including from several large pools. I believe Bitcoin Unlimited will probably succeed.""  Origins of ViaBTC  The story doesn't quite stop there, however.  As mentioned earlier, ViaBTC is a relatively unknown mining pool, and at nearly 10% of the network, it commands a lot of power for a mining pool that only launched last June.  However, Yang's explanation is that the quality of his team's software is simply a cut above what is offered by the market.  He said:  ""It is the fastest pool for finding and broadcasting blocks. Since [the] beginning we have had zero orphan blocks.""  As for how he's able to achieve the feat, Yang said he used to work for Chinese Internet giant Tencent and that he did work for Zeusminer maintaining a large litecoin mining farm. Other members of the company are current Tencent employees, he added.  Yang also argued that, due to the pool's unique payment method, the bitcoin transaction fees are distributed in a more equitable nature, thus allowing miners to generate more profit.  Despite all of its innovation, however, it remains largely unprecedented for a new mining pool to launch with approximately 100PH of hashing power, and other miners have called attention to the strange traction the pool has seen.  In a tweet, BTCC's Samson Mow asserted that ViaBTC is backed by Chinese mining giant Bitcoin.  ""It’s well known in China that ViaBTC’s backer is Bitmain. Mining pools with substantial hashrate don’t just appear out of thin air,"" he said.  Bitmain is the creator of the well-known Antminer mining hardware as well as the operator of both Antpool and BTC.com mining pool.  Jihan Wu, co-founder of Bitmain, has argued in the past that small blocks are dangerous to bitcoin, and he appeared at a protest event earlier this month that saw talks on alternative scaling solutions, including Bitcoin Unlimited.  When asked about Wu's involvement, Yang offered no comment, though he did hint that some relationship between the two firms might be disclosed.  Room for compromise  As for what to make of the developments, it remains clear that the road to a bitcoin scaling solution isn't yet cut and dry.  Eric Lombrozo, a Bitcoin Core developer and CEO of Ciphrex, expressed disappointment in how the scaling debate has become so politicized.  He explained that the launch of SegWit is in the economic best interest of miners because it will enable greater transaction throughput, allowing bitcoin to remain competitive in a market that increasingly offers a diverse array of blockchain solutions.  But, time will tell whether ViaBTC will follow the pack should SegWit see broad adoption. For example, as the interview went on, Yang's stance on the issue softened.  When asked whether ViaBTC would be willing to compromise if Bitcoin Unlimited did not gain further hashrate, he offered an opportunity for conversation.  He said:  ""If we do remain at a standstill, I think both sides should sit down and open friendly discussions to find compromise or make concessions, so that bitcoin can keep moving forward.""

42399416,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj73x,1476971922,Delaware Judge Pushes for Blockchain Voting,"A Delaware judge has advocated for using blockchain-based voting to put more power in the hands of corporate shareholders.  Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor J Travis Laster spoke late last month during a meeting of the Council of Institutional Investors, a non-profit organization dedicated to institutional investment issues. In his speech, Laster took aim at the business ecosystem for proxy voting – services that enable shareholders to cast votes on corporate decisions – arguing that “the current system works poorly and harms stockholders”.  He argued that issues with the way proxy voting happens today are largely driven by the services offering them, going on to advocate that new technologies like blockchain could provide much-needed solutions.  Laster told attendees:  “[Proxy services] are making healthy profits in a non-competitive market. They might play around the edges, but real change will have to come from the outside. The good news is that you have a plunger that you can use to clean up the plumbing. That plunger is distributed ledger technologies, the technology that drives bitcoin.”  But Laster's remarks didn’t come out of nowhere. Earlier this year, the government of Delaware launched an initiative to use the technology as a means to streamline the business registration process in the state. The state government is working with New York-based startup Symbiont on the project.  Using the technology to facilitate elections is also a concept that has been around for some time. Today, software updates are used as a means to signal development preferences for projects like bitcoin and ethereum, and bitcoin's proof-of-work system was described by creator Satoshi Nakamoto as a kind of ""vote"" in the original bitcoin white paper.  More recently, private services and local governments worldwide have begun testing the waters of this use case. Even Broadridge – a firm that drew Laster’s ire during his remarks – has been investing millions in developing blockchain-based voting mechanisms.  In his speech, Laster went on to cite complexity in how voting systems have been constructed as a primary driver for errors, arguing that the use of blockchain could deliver greater transparency and efficiency to an otherwise opaque process. He also called for the speedy adoption of the technology in order to begin addressing some of the concerns he aired.  “Someone is going to do this,” he said. “If a judge can see it, the opportunity is pretty obvious.”  Image via YouTube  This report has been updated for clarity.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/10/20/delaware-judge-pushes-for-blockchain-voting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d852715e29bbc687a56b67c1474617b0883305b7-1500x763.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42399422,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj79r,1476967218,Global Banks Test Ripple's Digital Currency in New Blockchain Trial,"It's no secret that cryptocurrencies have undergone a dramatic rebrand.  No longer perceived as a detriment to banks and governments, cryptocurrencies are now being hailed as ""digital assets"". As more and more financial intuitions become comfortable with the blockchain technology on which they are based, they are openly discussing a future when the financial tools are just another part of the industry.  Now, a dozen banks have announced the completion of an initiative during which they tested a potential application of a digital asset. Revealed today, 12 member banks of blockchain consortium R3CEV have completed a series of trials using distributed ledger startup Ripple's native asset, XRP.  The trials, conducted in an environment set up at R3's lab, were designed to show how banks could save money and create new revenue streams by using XRP to provide liquidity to their many bank accounts around the world.  Ripple head of global sales Nilesh Dusane said the effort revealed not only how banks could minimize delays getting funds to their customers, but save money by harnessing the technology.  Dusane told CoinDesk:  ""Everything comes down to return on investment. This project was aimed to show the ROI of reducing costs around liquidity by around 60%.""  Playing the 'nostro' margins  In short, instead of making banks redundant, this implementation was designed to show how the use of cryptocurrency could potentially make them money.  That's because for banks to do business around the world, they open accounts called nostro accounts that must be filled with local currency. Ripple argues this results in a waste of capital that the trials were designed to showcase.  First, Ripple contends that value is lost because currency that must be held in the account is capital that could be invested elsewhere – and adding liquidity to these accounts costs money. Second, if a customer needs to do business with the bank for an amount that exceeds what is in the nostro account, days-long delays can result.  Instead, the trials were intended to demonstrate that the Ripple network could enable banks to make markets for fiat currencies using XRP and then complete authenticated payments without multiple nostro accounts.  Throughout the tests, participating banks including Barclays, CIBC, Intesa Sanpaolo, the Royal Bank of Canada and Santander were given control of their own wallets and the ability to move funds from one virtual location to another.  No actual cross-border payments occurred, according to Dusane.  ""Because of our real-time settlement, banks can on demand, buy euros [or another currency] in chunks so their capital is not tied up,"" he added. ""If there are instances when their needs are more than they have, they can make those decisions instantly.""  It's not a blockchain  Still, the ability for Ripple's distributed ledger to operate without a currency has proved appealing to an increasing number of financial institutions that are otherwise wary of the stigma surrounding bitcoin.  Such sentiment led Ripple to launch a report earlier this year which aimed to showcase the cost savings that using a digital currency with a distributed ledger could achieve.  Released in February, Ripple argued that its tech could provide banks with a 33% savings on international payments. Yet, this figure rose to 42% when digital currencies were used to facilitate the trades.  Indeed, the increasing use of Ripple's technology without a digital currency led to market confusion about the company and its goals, a fact acknowledged by CEO Chris Larsen in a March interview with CoinDesk.  ""We could do a better job of communicating that XRP is essential to the Internet of Value,"" Larsen said at the time.  And there are reasons Ripple may have shied away from this argument.  Like all cryptocurrencies, Ripple’s price has undergone dramatic fluctuations since it’s launch. At one point in 2014, the value of XRP approached $800m before settling down to its current market cap of about $300m, where it has been more or less steady since May 2015.  XRP is currently valued at $0.008 with 35.4bn tokens held by the public and 64.5bn tokens held by Ripple. When Ripple first launched, the company created all $100bn worth of the currency and dispersed the funds to over 25,000 beta users.  Overcoming the stigma  That's not to say there weren't regulatory considerations needed for the trial.  For example, R3 co-founder and COO Todd McDonald said the tests were designed in consideration of consortium members' own regulatory needs. With bank participants from places as diverse as Italy, Australia, Canada and Scotland, regulatory requirements were diverse, forcing regional solutions in spite of the consortium model.  ""At the end of the day payments and regulation is local and those are the questions that need to be answered,"" said McDonald. ""Local regulators need to understand the value proposition.""  However, the cryptocurrency environment today is also more established from a regulatory perspective than it was during the early days of bitcoin, a point put forward by Dusane.  ""There is globally a lot more clarity from a regulatory standpoint about how digital assets like XRP should be treated,"" Dusane said. ""Banks can now for sure understand what they can do with a digital asset like XRP.""  But there is another reason banks are opening up to cryptocurrency, according to Trond Undheim, a former senior lecturer of MIT Sloan School of Management, who earlier this year wrote an article about why banks ""fear bitcoin"".  Now the founder of knowledge discovery platform Yegii, Undheim told CoinDesk that he believes banks were originally hesitant because they weren't sure how such experiments might impact investor confidence, but that the fear of missing out has taken over.  Undheim concluded:  ""Now, it is almost the opposite. Disruption and innovation is moving so fast that if they don't get on board, they realize they will be perceived as losing their mojo. They also find they still have a role to play in the emerging financial system post the FinTech revolution.""

Bitnet CEO and co-founder John McDonnell and chief data architect Jiri Novak will become part of a new offering called Uphold Merchant Services, which will aim to provide payment and financing services to businesses that use the Uphold platform. Bitnet was acquired as part of the deal.  The company, formerly known as Bitreserve, was founded by CNET founder Halsey Minor and formally launched in late 2014. The platform later rebranded as Uphold.  McDonnell and Novak join the startup months after Japanese e-commerce firm Rakuten acquired Bitnet's assets. Former Bitnet employees Fergal Downey and Stephen McNamara would go on to become part of a new blockchain lab founded by Rakuten, using the company's assets to kickstart that effort.  McDonnell, who will serve as CEO of Uphold Merchant Services, said in a statement:  “Uphold is uniquely positioned as the first ‘cloud-based’ financial services platform that leverages the operating efficiencies of blockchain technology while providing access to the legacy bank and payment networks.""  The announcement comes two years after Bitnet announced that it had raised $14.5m in a Series A funding round.
