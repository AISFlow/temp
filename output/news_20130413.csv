42376440,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AZbj,1365836829,A week is a long time in Bitcoin world,"This week the price of a Bitcoin soared to more than $260 - albeit for a short period of time. This was helped by a surge in media interest. This week has seen the number of articles on Bitcoin and virtual currency explode to an all time high. Journalists appear to be enjoying another internet story whose next chapter is unknown.    Jonathan  's test.  There've been numerous attempts to suggest where it all might end up - many suggesting that Bitcoin is a flawed currency because of the way it is behaving.

Speculation has run over what will actually happen with the price and adoption of Bitcoin. Some people have tried to plot its adoption trends on a technology adoption curve. But that model assumes that one or few sellers control the price - and doesn't change it very often.

Coindesk has heard unconfirmed rumours of larger purchases in the last two weeks. It wouldn't be a week in Bitcoin without mentioning hackers. They finished off the week by disrupting the biggest Bitcoin trading platform, Mt.Gox, with a DDoS attack, forcing the organisation to temporarily cease trades.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Dan Ilett,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/13/a-week-is-a-long-time-in-bitcoin-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e81a6caeca223f649d2aa75ceef93c7d759c1a8a-1000x726.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
