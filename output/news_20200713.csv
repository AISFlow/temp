42384122,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0X3H,1594672259,"Market Wrap: Stocks Make Gains While Bitcoin Sticks to $9,200","A bullish stock market left bitcoin behind Monday with the world’s oldest cryptocurrency trading flat.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $9,226 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET) and flat, up only 0.10% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $9,193-$9,339  BTC price below 10-day and 50-day moving average, a bearish signal for market technicians.    The absence of action in bitcoin is in contrast to the performance of global equities on Monday. Stocks across the world today:    In Asia the Nikkei 225 closed up 2.2% led by big gains in Mazda Motors and Nikon.  In Europe the FTSE 100 index ended the day up 1.3% as optimism for a coronavirus drug treatment led stocks higher.  The U.S. S&P 500 index slipped 1% after a rally lost steam and tech stocks ended the day in the red.    “In recent trading sessions, bitcoin traded in a narrow range of $9,100-$9,200,” said Constantin Kogan, partner at cryptocurrency fund BitBull Capital. “After a short-term bullish impulse, the asset managed to peak at $9,300, followed by a downward correction.”      Over the past few days, bitcoin has approached $9,320, only to see the price drop, Kogan noted.      “The first resistance for bitcoin is at $9,320, the next important zone, the passage of which will give strength to the bulls at $9,400.”      Read More: Drop in Bitcoin ‘Whale’ Addresses Suggests Market May Be Decentralizing      “There is a clear lack of energy in the bitcoin market,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for broker Swissquote. “DeFi has more energy just now [and] some are focusing on that.”      Spot exchanges such as Coinbase continue to be plagued with low trading volumes in July, said BitBull’s Kogan. He also pointed out the uncertainty bitcoin traders are currently facing in these unprecedented economic times. “The Index of Fear and Greed has increased by several points since last week and approached a neutral value, which indicates confusion among market participants,” said Kogan.      Despite the uncertainty, the bitcoin mining sector is showing no signs of slowing down, Kogan noted. “The bitcoin hashrate has reached a new maximum. This indicates the continued interest of miners in cryptocurrency mining,” he said.      Regardless of the bitcoin volume slump, traders always find assets to trade. Josh Rager, a trader and adviser for crypto brokerage LevelInvest has been focusing on altcoins - alternative assets to bitcoin. “A slow grind is good. I'm neutral, just trading alts,” Rager told CoinDesk.    Ethereum fees are up    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was flat Monday, trading around $238 and in the red 0.10% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Goerge Clayton, managing partner of Cryptanalysis Capital, says the rise in fees could be a sign that the Ethereum network could reach some sort of limitation in transactions. “ETH fees are rising,” Clayton said. “Not sure where it all ends up.

42384109,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0Wlf,1594670181,Researcher Hopes Cosmos-Style 'Checkpoint' Could Fix Ethereum's Data Problem,"Ethereum developers are aspiring to launch Eth 2.0 in 2020. But that doesn’t mean all the technical details have been spelled out yet.      The sum of account balances maintained by the network’s nodes – called the state – continues to grow larger and larger as applications and projects transact. Adoption is good, but runaway growth is bad. Independent developer Alexey Akhunov may have a solution – one pulled from Cosmos, the interoperability blockchain.      His new proposal, dubbed “ReGenesis,” posted on EthResearch on June 24, would bring stateless client research to the current Ethereum chain (also known as Eth 1.x) by “nuking” certain nodes' states and swapping them with a math proof on a rolling basis.      The purpose? Make Ethereum’s data set scalable with minimal sacrifices to security.      “Some of the older nodes will forget about the state,” Akhunov said in an interview with CoinDesk. “At this point in time, all the nodes will forget what the state was. They will only remember the hash.”    ReGenesis    Nuking the blockchain isn’t a novel idea. In fact, the idea is mentioned in the Ethereum yellow paper by co-founder Gavin Wood.      Akhunov said he drew inspiration for his interpretation of ReGenesis from Cosmos, which has undergone a similar procedure multiple times to make the chain “lighter.”      “I call this ‘relaunch’ ReGenesis, and it can be done regularly to ease the burden on the non-mining nodes. It also represents a less dramatic version of Stateless Ethereum,” Akhunov wrote.      WATCH: Vitalik Buterin Explains the New Tech Behind Eth 2.0      Supporting stateless clients – meaning nodes that would carry as little state information as possible to verify transactions – has been a prime objective of Eth 2.0 in order to decrease data strains on Ethereum nodes. ReGenesis would incorporate some of the Ethereum researchers’ insights into the transitionary period, or Eth 1.x.      Akhunov’s proposal works like a video-game checkpoint. Every time the Ethereum blockchain hits a certain block number, the network would auto save. Then it would delete all its progress minus a “proof” or “witness” of all the past transactions. The autosave could then be stored on other networks like BitTorrent, Akhunov said.      The proof allows the reborn Ethereum chain to begin again from a sure foundation, but only for certain types of nodes, Akhunov said.      “What we are removing is the assumption that all other validating nodes have the access to that implicit state to check that the transactions in the block are valid and the state root hash presented in the block header matches up with the result of the execution of that block,” he wrote.      This checkpoint system is already used in different ways for bringing new nodes online, such as in Beam sync.    Waxing Ethereum    ReGenesis is hardly wandering off the range when it comes to Ethereum philosophy.      Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin describes similar assumptions found in ReGenesis in a 2014 blog entitled, “Proof of Stake: How I Learned to Love Weak Subjectivity.”      There, Buterin argues a node can be trusted under certain constraints even if it begins from a checkpoint instead of the genesis block. Like ReGenesis, Buterin proposes a node merely “get a recent block hash from a friend” to rejoin the network and begin validating transactions again.      Akhunov’s proposal is intended for Ethereum's current proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain. But it operates under similar assumptions found in Buterin’s thoughts on proof-of-stake (PoS) by segregating the network into “full nodes” and “stateless clients” that rely on outside proofs.      Weak subjectivity itself is taken to its logical conclusion with the ongoing research project Stateless Ethereum and PoS. That project hopes to create a method for transactions to be verified based on the transaction hash and a math proof alone in Eth 2.0.    Nuking or pruning?    ReGenesis reflects much about Stateless Ethereum and Eth 2.0’s unresolved latter steps. For now, it's a promising project that many in the community have gotten behind, just as they have done with Akhunov’s other project, TurboGeth.      Read more: 'Turbo Geth' Seeks to Scale Ethereum – And It's Already in Beta      One issue team leader at Ethereum Foundation client Geth Péter Szilágyi pointed out, however, is that ReGenesis does not technically decrease the state. It only “prunes” the chain.      In other words, Szilágyi is saying some parties will still have to maintain a full copy of the state without the assistance of Akhunov’s proposal because they need to access the old state in order to send transactions. If some must use the full ledger, then the state has not been truly “nuked.”      A big state could be big trouble. Two such consequences include slower processing speeds and an easier target for distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks. In other words, private transactions have public consequences for blockchains, particularly for application-hosting ledgers.      Not only that, but many decentralized applications (dapps) such as Web 3.0 browsers could struggle to work without a “reboot,” Szilágyi said. Many dapps need to access the full state in order to work and not just a proof.      “Ultimately, it always boils down to what can you afford to delete. If the Ethereum ecosystem permits us to delete old blocks, or old logs, a loooot can be achieved. If not – and Ethereum sold them that nothing gets deleted – we have problems,” Szilágyi said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | WALLET | RESEARCH,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/13/researcher-hopes-cosmos-style-checkpoint-could-fix-ethereums-data-problem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f34205f14cfe66d8f31aa48af2a7ff7554e15dee-2560x1696.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384099,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0SQR,1594665456,Google Searches for Chainlink Hits High as Link Token Rallies,"Retail interest in Chainlink, which acts as a bridge between cryptocurrency smart contracts and off-chain data feeds, is now at the highest level it has been in well over a year.      According to Google Trends, worldwide queries for the word “Chainlink” on the search engine reached a score of 100 in the week ended July 12, more than double what it was the preceding week. A score of 100 indicates it is the maximum number of searches observed for a term during a given time frame.      The increased retail interest in the project could be attributed to the link token’s recent meteoric price rally.      The price of link, an ERC-20 token used to pay for services on the Chainlink network, rose to a record high of $8.48 early Monday, having rallied by 50% in the last week alone. At press time, link was changing hands at around $7.90 on major exchanges, up 73% on a month-to-date basis and 350% on a year-to-date basis.      Due to the record price rally, link is now one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies of 2020 and the tenth-largest cryptocurrency by market value, according to data source Messari. Leading link are DeFi tokens including Aave’s lend protocol, which is up over 900% on a year-to-date basis. Meanwhile, bitcoin, ether, XRP and other major coins are substantially lagging.      Link’s impressive rally seems to have been fueled by Chainlink’s increased usage in the ever-growing decentralized finance (DeFi) space.      Read more: DeFi Driving Chainlink’s Link Token to Record Highs      Search queries for cryptocurrencies or for any financial asset usually rise during a record price rally. However, quite often it does not translate into increased investor participation. This is because retail investors are averse to high price volatility.      However, in Link’s case, the number of new addresses and active addresses has risen sharply alongside the spike in search queries. As such, it may be surmised that the peak retail interest is translating into additional buying pressure.      Daily active addresses rose to a 13-month high of 9,263 and new addresses, as represented by network growth, set a 12-month high of 4,517 on July 8, according to data provided by Santiment, a blockchain analytics company.      Daily active addresses and new addresses are up 800% and 900%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis.    Extreme bullish sentiment?    While Chainlink’s long-term prospects may appear bright courtesy of the ongoing multi-year shift in focus from base layer protocols to middleware services, in the short run the cryptocurrency looks vulnerable to a price pullback, as the sentiment looks to have turned overly bullish.      “Chainlink is proof that no one knows what they are talking about and crypto fundamentals is basically macro sentiment, alchemy and animal spirits. I love what the team is working on, but the token is going nuts. I do not understand anything of it,” Ryan Selkis, founder of Messari, tweeted early Monday.

42384098,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0SRh,1594658119,Blockchain Bites: It's Never Been Harder to Mine Bitcoin,"Bitcoin's mining difficulty is at a record high, Singapore's central bank digital currency could find commercial use and Chinese firms are going in on Filecoin. Here's the story:      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Record Level Mining Difficulty Bitcoin’s mining difficulty, an automatic adjusting feature, is at a record high. This adjustment reflects increasing computer power on the network and, potentially, investment in new mining machines, despite bitcoin ranging between $9,100 and $9,500 since early July. The increased difficulty comes two months after Bitcoin’s quadrennial halving, which has complicated the economy of Bitcoin miners and machinery that secure the network.      Filecoin Miners Eight of the top 10 Filecoin testnet miners are Chinese investors or companies, according to the blockchain explorer, while more companies are selling cloud mining contracts and physical hardware for the distributed file sharing system. “The Filecoin craze in China may be largely related to the long-standing popularity of crypto mining in the country in general, which is home to around 65% of the computing power on Bitcoin by estimation,” CoinDesk’s Wolfie Zhao writes.      Privacy Matters Developer Chris Belcher is trying to bring privacy to Bitcoin. He’s building out an idea first proposed in 2013, CoinSwap, and has been awarded two grants for his effort. “CoinSwap could be said to allow bitcoins to teleport undetectably to anywhere else on the blockchain,” Bitcoin Wiki writes. Bitcoin’s cryptographic underpinning allows anyone to look at a history of any transaction – skewering any sense of real privacy. CoinSwaps and other privacy-minded advancements are trying to bring the anonymous aspects of cash to the blockchain.      Not Binding A federal judge said Telegram’s court battle did not set a precedent for a similar case involving Kik’s battle with the SEC. “I think that there is no binding precedent one way or another,” Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein said. The SEC is pursuing action against Kik related to its $100 million ICO. The SEC won a preliminary injunction against Telegram this year, ordering the company to halt the issuance of its gram tokens, and the firm later discontinued the TON project.      CBDC Going Live The next phase for a blockchain-based central bank digital currency project in Singapore “will be in implementing live commercial solutions to solve real world challenges,"" after the experiment completed its development cycle. Designed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and state investor Temasek, Ubin, as the project is known, has been running as a multi-currency payments platform and has leveraged work on a blockchain and digital currency at U.S. investment bank JPMorgan.    Quick bites  Bitcoin Gold developers foiled a 51% attack  Fidelity holds over 10% stake in bitcoin mining firm Hut 8 (The Block)  A Ripple founder is building a surveillance network in San Francisco (Decrypt)  Making links    Chainlink is surging today, as it has for the past several days, weeks and months. Driven by integrations within the open finance ecosystem and a committed band of “Link Marines,” link is repeatedly passing lifetime highs.  Messari’s Ryan Selkis reflected on the trend this morning and said, “On a fully diluted basis, $LINK hit $8 [billion]+ today. That’s higher than Coinbase’s last valuation.” This is a significant milestone for what is only a piece of a larger financial system.  Chainlink is an Ethereum-based system of oracles that supplies data to other decentralized projects. As CoinDesk has reported, insiders think link’s continued price rise is driven by DeFi’s growing reliance on its technology.  No one can honestly say whether Chainlink is driven by “fundamentals” or FOMO, but this is as good a time as any to get into Gartner’s theory of Hype Cycles.  According to the research giant, the adoption of novel technologies follows a predictable lifecycle. There’s the initial innovation, a “peak of inflated expectations,” a period of disillusionment, the slope of enlightenment – defined by a growing number of use cases and pilot programs – and, finally, mainstream adoption.  This tidy theory only works in reverse, if a technology takes off. For some Chainlink observers, the platform is clearly following the slope of enlightenment. Skeptics think the crypto is cresting on a peak of inflated expectations, which will crash and potentially never recover.  There’s no clear answer to whether this is hype or a Hype Cycle, but in the words of CoinDesk Head of Research Noelle Acheson, reflecting on the dogecoin hype and irrational stock market ebullience:  “When markets don’t make any sense, when fundamentals no longer seem to matter, it becomes clear the rules are being rewritten or even thrown out the window. We could be in the creative destruction phase that will give way to a new wave of innovation. And in that wave, new types of assets could have a respectable place in new types of portfolios.”    Market intel    Whale Breach There are now 103 addresses holding at least 10,000 BTC, the lowest in more than a year, according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. There has been an 8% decline in the number of “whale” addresses over the past two months. What this means for bitcoin’s price is difficult to work out. While some see this as reflecting weaker buying pressure (potentially foreseeing a price drop), the trend also points to the Bitcoin network decentralizing. Data shows the number of addresses holding at least 1 BTC, 0.1 BTC or 0.01 BTC continues to reach new record highs. “As such, one could argue that bitcoin ownership is being transferred from relatively few whales to a large number of smaller investors,” CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole writes.    Opinion    Hyper-Stablecoinization Pascal Hügli, chief research officer at Schlossberg & Co., sees stablecoins, or crypto dollars appended to a blockchain, as succeeding where the eurodollar has failed. “The eurodollar approach was an attempt by private actors to create a dollar funding system outside the U.S., but still within the traditional financial system. Crypto dollars mainly reside outside of the traditional, U.S.-led financial system. Because of its inherent auditability, the crypto-dollar system is more transparent than the old euro dollar system based on shadow banking (so named for a reason),” he writes.      Crypto Long & Short: Interpreting Value Noelle Acheson, CoinDesk’s head of research, dives into last week’s dogecoin phenomenon, which saw a handful of TikTok videos shoot the memetic cryptocurrency on a price tear. “It has nothing to do with fundamentals, potential or even government handouts – most participants probably don’t even understand what cryptocurrency is (many of the videos refer to DOGE as a “stock”). It’s about manipulation, just because,” she writes. “When you have the next generation of investors blatantly flaunting that markets are a meaningless casino, when you have them advertising that markets can be manipulated, then you do have to wonder what role markets will have in their lives as they get older.”    Podcast    Catching the Lightning Bug Chaincode Labs researcher Clara Shikhelman has been studying mathematics in university since she was 14 years old. Now, as the bitcoin company’s newest post-doctoral fellow, she is exploring ways to optimize the Lightning Network. Listen in to why Lightning attracted her attention. “There are a lot of people like me, their main thing is academic,” Shikhelman said. “They are not the classic cypherpunk people, but …[t]hey believe in privacy, in political change.”    Crypto Memeing",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/13/blockchain-bites-its-never-been-harder-to-mine-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1b0c6856e7942f4270834b8e97e5812a4dae12f-2400x1263.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a blog post on Monday, Gavin Wood, co-founder and president of Polkadot developer Web3 Foundation, said community stakeholders could vote on a proposal to redenominate the smallest unit of DOT – a Planck.  If successful, it will lead to a corresponding increase in the DOT supply.  Open to all DOT holders, there are four options on the table: no change or increasing supply by 10x, 100x, or 1,000x.  If any of the redenomination proposals passes, the DOT price, according to CoinGecko, could well move from its present $152 to $15, $1.52, or $0.15, respectively.  Polkadot only went live in late May so this will be the protocol's first community vote.  A supply of 10 million was originally agreed for the 2017 initial coin offering but Web3 Foundation said in a tweet thread Monday that a token supply of 1 billion would now be more ""logical.""  The polls have now opened and community members have two weeks to cast their vote.  A similar proposal already passed on Kusama, Polkadot's test-tube blockchain, more than two months ago.

In a July 8 blog post summarizing a recent report called ""Smart Contract Technology and Financial Inclusion"" the international financial institution looked at the role smart contracts could play in improving financial services in poorer nations.  Smart contracts are pieces of code that automatically execute the terms of a contract based on a specific set of rules.  The World Bank looked at two main areas of financial services including index-linked insurance and short-term unsecured loans.  On the insurance side, the institution looked at penetration, or the ratio of policy premiums underwritten over a 12-month period against the gross domestic product (GDP) of a given nation.  The post stated that smart contracts would not help fix many common issues with insurance penetration, but could assist in determining whether a particular insurance product was suitable as well as increasing trust in the product amongst stakeholders.  Examining short-term loans, the World Bank found that while smart contracts could increase efficiency with the different phases of a loan cycle, those phases are already highly automated and therefore the new technology would be redundant.  The post's authors said a major factor in the costs of consumer credit was based on consumer risk and that smart contracts would be of ""limited"" benefit in improving borrowers' credit ratings.  The World Bank was founded in 1944 for the purpose of providing loans to governments of developing nations in order to tackle poverty.  The institution has been involved in a number of blockchain projects, including raising over $100 million through the issuance of bonds on the Ethereum network.

Abra and Plutus have agreed to settle both suits, $150,000 each, without admitting to or denying the accusations of the order.  Abra launched as a bitcoin remittance app in 2014 and has upped the number of crypto-related services to include more coins and other services over the years.  The SEC found fault with Abra for offering retail investors contracts that provided synthetic exposure to the U.S. stock market. While not actually securities, the SEC says security-based swaps were nonetheless subject to U.S. securities law.  Abra started offering the swaps in February 2019.  Both the SEC and CFTC said the company did nothing to check whether investors were actually eligible.  Abra briefly shut down the offering after a warning from the SEC early in 2019; it resumed it in May of that year after it limited the service to non-U.S. residents.  Although Abra moved some of its operations overseas, most of the contracts were still designed and marketed from the company's headquarters in San Francisco.  Overall, Abra has raised more than $45 million in a series of venture capital rounds; the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) invested $5 million into Abra in May.  Plutus Financial, which conducts business as Abra, received between $350,000 and $1 million in U.S. ""PPP"" bailout loans in April.

42384096,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0SNv,1594649962,Version Control Can Help the Media Win Back Reader Trust,"CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is a partner at Castle Island Ventures, a venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass., that focuses on public blockchains. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.      Everyone knows the internet has changed the fundamental business model of journalism. Before the internet age, people subscribed to a physical newspaper that arrived once a day, and they were happy to do it, too. Newsrooms invested in shoe-leather journalists who had the flexibility to pursue a story for months.      The press wasn’t perfect but it was weighty because subscriptions and advertising meant newsrooms were flush with cash, and long-running investigations could be financed. And the concrete nature of the news gave it a certain finality and weightiness. If a newspaper got something wrong, it had to publish a retraction because the editors couldn’t go back and edit the ink on the page once published. Retractions are embarrassing, so newsrooms generally tried to get it right the first time.      See also: Nic Carter - Your Property Rights Should Extend to Social Media      Today, things look very different. Data-rich advertisers like Facebook and Google now account for most ad spending online. Local journalism is feeling the squeeze as treasured smaller outlets get rolled up by private equity firms or simply go out of business. Larger publications remain but margins are being compressed, with the industry consolidating into a handful of winners. Due to the media’s pivot to an online publishing model, editorial standards have been relaxed. Instead of treating published articles as final, news outlets may take the opportunity to change content after publication.      But many outlets take an interactive approach, getting feedback from their readers and editing headlines after the fact and often without any acknowledgement. One particularly egregious example can be found in the Washington Post’s obituary of Islamic State head Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, in which they referred to him in the headline as an “austere religious leader,” rather than making his career as a terrorist the focus. In response to criticism, this headline was changed – but no mention of the alteration can be found in the article today.      Of course, the best phrase to use to describe him is a matter of debate, but the point is the Post shifted between different treatments of the issue at will, with no acknowledgement of its mistake. It’s important for the public to know the Post initially issued a lukewarm obituary for a terrorist, as this materially affects the newspaper’s credibility on these issues.    News outlets should commit to the contents of their article by hashing it along with the headline, and publishing that hash in a costly-to-reverse blockchain like Bitcoin.    These stealth edits are done partially out of convenience, and due to the fast-moving nature of the news today, but also because the changes allow news outlets to more conveniently tailor their coverage to the cultural zeitgeist, effectively becoming malleable to the whims of social media critics. As mistakes are rarely admitted, awkward turns of phrase can be sent down the memory hole, with the public none the wiser. This effectively allows the press to avoid confessing to its mistakes and limits the process of accountability. Unless a keen-eyed commentator archives an article when published, stealth edits can occur without anyone knowing.      So I’d like to propose a very simple solution. At the time of publication, news outlets should commit to the contents of their article by hashing it along with the headline, and publishing that hash in a costly-to-reverse blockchain like Bitcoin. This situates a specific piece of data (the text of the article and the title) in time, localizing it to an hour-or-so window (if using Bitcoin) and makes evident any subsequent changes to the content. If at any point the contents of the article are altered, the hash of the text will no longer match and this will be trivially observable. Of course, the publication can always create a new hash with the edit incorporated, but it won’t be indexed to the time of initial publication. Unless the publication is willing to lie about when articles were published (and this deception would be easy to spot) the system holds up. A publication could timestamp multiple versions of an article and switch them out after the fact if it knew ahead of time which edits it might want to make. So the system isn’t perfectly ironclad, as the publication would have to demonstrate uniqueness as well as chronological localization. There are some initiatives to work on unique proofs of publication like Peter Todd’s Proofmarshal or CommerceBlock’s Mainstay, but ultimately the solution does not lie in tech alone. Readers will have to demand more accountability from the news organisations that they rely on, and these publishers will have to respond in kind.      To demonstrate a primitive version of one such system, I have hashed the exact contents of this article into Bitcoin’s blockchain using Open Timestamps on July 9. (Use the .ots file and the .txt file linked at the end of the article to verify the timestamp.)      See also: David Morris - The Year in Crypto Journalism: Truth Will Always Be Human      Contrary to the occasional utopian proclamations of enthusiasts, public blockchains aren’t magical machines that ensure all data inserted into them is valid or true. But in this very limited context, they thrive. Timestamps on-chain prove some specific data existed as a specific time. This suffices: We are trying to prove a specific article configuration existed at the time of publication and did not change thereafter.      I am not the first to propose something similar: for an earlier take see Janine Römer’s discussion of Revision Controlled Journalism. These ideas have existed for a while, and they can easily be instrumentalized now that we have effectively immutable cloud notaries in the form of public blockchains.      I don’t expect this proposal to be enthusiastically accepted by mainstream publications, but I do believe challenger outlets aiming to compete on credibility and accountability will consider embracing the practice. It costs very little, generates a strong signal that the publisher is willing to stand behind the content and demonstrates a commitment to getting it right the first time around. In the ephemeral internet age, the discipline of immutability is worth defending.      Thanks to Peter Todd for his feedback on this article.

42384089,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0SF7,1594648454,Fidelity International Doubles Stake in Bitcoin Mining Firm Hut 8,"Billion-dollar fund manager Fidelity International has doubled its equity investment in bitcoin mining company Hut 8, bringing its total stake to over 10%.    In a filing with the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) last week, the fund manager disclosed it had acquired 4.1 million ""units"" in Hut 8 on June 23 in an overnight offering.  Each unit represents a combined offering of one common share and the option to purchase another in the next 18 months.  Fidelity International, a spin-off of Fidelity Investments, already held approximately 4 million common shares in Hut 8.  Last month's purchase, including the options, means it now controls over 10.5% of the Toronto-listed crypto mining company.  Hut 8 closed a C$8.3 million funding round (US$6.1 million) on June 23, with the total raise being over C$800,000 above its target.  Fidelity's investment may have comprised nearly three-quarters of the raise, based on the total of around 5.7 million units changing hands.  CoinDesk has approached Hut 8 for more information.  In an overnight offering, a company sells equity once the market has closed at the end-of-day price to prevent short-sellers from depressing it any further.  Hut 8's share price spiraled since listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange, falling from $3.35 in April 2018 to a low of $0.50 in March 2020.  Fidelity may be bullish about Hut 8, though, as the option for a common share is at a purchase price of $1.80 – more than double its current trading value of over $0.80 at press time.

This is the latest milestone for a project that has led the yield farming craze in decentralized finance (DeFi), where both large and small investors search for the best place to park their assets in order to earn the strongest returns.      The platform reached $933 million on July 10 before surging by an additional $70 million in loans over the weekend. Prior to the current rush to mine fresh COMP, the loans were typically understood to be taken out to facilitate further crypto trading.      Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      The loans are generated permissionlessly, with users only having to provide collateral in one of several different approved crypto assets. That is, every borrower is also a depositor, though it is also possible to deposit funds without lending, in order to increase the pool from which others can borrow.      Since June 15, both borrowers and depositors have been earning the Compound governance token, COMP. This has led to a spike in activity on the site.      Other DeFi projects have since followed suit, either releasing or announcing their own governance-token-mining schemes (see crypto-index protocol Balancer, flash-loan purveyor bZx and automated market maker Curve for examples).    Dizzy numbers    COMP's debut has also yielded some strange situations, such as in the case of DAI. As of now, nearly $800 million in DAI have been borrowed on Compound, this despite the fact the total market cap of DAI is only $195 million, according to CoinGecko.      This is because users want to maximize their COMP returns, so they increase their leverage by using various strategies to borrow DAI, deposit what they borrowed and then borrow more.      Right now, dai is by far the most popular token to borrow, with USDC and ETH following as a distant second and third.      Read more: There Are More DAI on Compound Now Than There Are DAI in the World      Close followers of the DeFi boom may be somewhat confused by the $1 billion number here, as DeFi Pulse reports Compound as having $699 million in total value locked (TVL), as of this writing. This confusion is caused by the fact that the site reports Compound's deposits minus the loans it has made. Setting loans aside, Compound currently has $1.7 billion in total deposits, according to its own tracker.    Compound interest    To illustrate how dramatic the release of this token has been: DeFi Pulse shows Compound as having just under $100 million in total deposits on June 14, the day before COMP mining began.      Compound was first announced in September 2018, with funding from Bain Capital Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain. It announced a subsequent $25 million round last November, led by Andreessen Horowitz.      As of this writing, the COMP token is trading at $173, down from an all-time high of $373 on June 21, according to CoinGecko.

42384102,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0SUD,1594642338,Drop in Bitcoin 'Whale' Addresses Suggests Market May Be Decentralizing,"The number of whale addresses, or those holding a large number of bitcoins, has declined to a 14-month low.      However, the drop isn't necessarily a price-bearish development and may instead indicate the distribution of bitcoin ownership is shifting.      As of Sunday, there were 103 addresses holding at least 10,000 BTC – the lowest since May 2019, according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. The number has declined by 8% over that 2.5-month period.      Ten thousand bitcoin is worth close to $93 million at press time.      Some may see the decline in the whale addresses as a sign of weaker buying pressure and anticipate a price drop as a result. However, Richard Rosenblum, co-founder, and co-head of trading at crypto liquidity provider GSR, suggests otherwise.      “It’s bearish to see the biggest holders reducing their stakes, but bullish to see the market becoming more decentralized,” Rosenblum told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.    Market shift?    Validating Rosenblum’s comments is the growth seen in the number of lower-value bitcoin addresses over the past couple of months.      For instance, there were 2,155 addresses holding at least 1,000 coins on Sunday, up nearly 3% from a low of 2,097 observed in April.      Meanwhile, the number of addresses holding at least 1 BTC continues to reach new record highs. So do addresses holding 0.1 BTC and 0.01 BTC.      As such, one could argue bitcoin ownership is being transferred from relatively few whales to a large number of smaller investors.      “Over time, you would expect [bitcoin] to naturally dissipate to more hands,” said Rosenblum.    Data limits    Blockchains are transparent and allow every single transaction to be viewed and analyzed. Even so, drawing definite conclusions from metrics such as address growth can be challenging because a single user or an exchange can own multiple addresses.      “Whales may not be having all of their holdings in a single address and moving crypto for risk management purposes,” said Simon Peters, a crypto market analyst at investment platform eToro.      As such, an increase or decrease in the number of bitcoin addresses may not fully represent the entry or exit of investors.

42384100,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0SSx,1594641357,First Mover: Twelve-Fold Gains for Aave's LEND Token Might Be More Than DeFi Hype,"There’s one thing that all investors like: doubling, tripling or even quadrupling their money. How about a 12-fold increase?      That’s what traders have reaped this year from the decentralized lender Aave’s LEND token, up about 1,200% on a year-to-date basis.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Other tokens from the realm of decentralized finance, known as DeFi, are up by triple-digit percentages, including Synthetix’s SNX, Thorchain’s RUNE and Kyber’s KNC. Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is up just 28%.      It would be easy to write off such outsize gains as just another example of the speculative hype of cryptocurrency markets, where big price swings are common. But in the case of the LEND token, the price rise may have been fueled by an increase in actual usage.      Some $158 million of value have been deposited as collateral in Aave’s lending protocol just six months after the project went live in January. By comparison, Compound, another decentralized lender, had just $27 million in its protocol at its six-month mark in March 2019. Compound has since gone on to increase the figure, known as total value locked, by 25-fold to $684 million, to become the largest lending protocol, according to DeFi Pulse, which tracks the industry.      “The main reason I suspect LEND has received so much attention is simply because, after launching the mainnet early this year, usage on Aave has grown incredibly fast,” Jack Purdy, an analyst with digital-asset research firm Messari, told First Mover in an email.      Last week, Aave rolled out a new feature, “credit delegation,” which effectively allows users to set up credit lines that could then be drawn down by other users in a form of peer-to-peer lending. Under the program, investors can deposit stablecoins – digital tokens backed by U.S. dollars or other government currencies – and then delegate the right to borrow against that collateral to another user.      The delegator can set terms of the loans, such as interest rates and amount of capital that can be drawn. Since the ultimate borrower isn’t posting collateral via the platform, the delegator is bearing most of the risk and might be able to charge higher interest rates.      “Aave's introduction of credit delegation is groundbreaking,” Su Zhu, CEO of the Singapore-based digital-asset fund Three Arrows Capital, told First Mover in a Telegram message.      Aave CEO Stani Kulechov told First Mover in a Discord chat the “market capitalization of LEND has been following mostly our protocol growth.”      “Most of the traction comes due to our wide asset selection that you can use as collateral and the ability to borrow flash loans without collateral, which has become a popular tool,” Kulechov wrote.      In a Tweet last week, Kulechov wrote that credit delegation could help push DeFi into “financial debt markets worldwide,” making it a “liquidity backbone.” Borrowers could be cryptocurrency exchanges, market makers, lenders, institutions, businesses, non-governmental organizations or governments, he wrote.      Not that LEND isn’t benefiting from speculation at all: Some traders might be extrapolating how Aave’s usage might increase going forward, giving the token’s price an additional lift.      Aave is positioned squarely within the fast-growing DeFi industry, and some industry executives that these autonomous or semi-autonomous systems could ultimately challenge or displace banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies and money managers.      ""Overcollateralized lending is capital inefficient, and uncollateralized lending has been one of key missing pieces to DeFi lending,” Messari analysts noted in a July 7 blog post. “Assuming it works, it has the potential to significantly scale DeFi lending.""    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,280 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,349 | 24-Hr Low: $9,170      Trend: Bitcoin jumped 2.53% in the seven days to July 12, snapping a four-week losing streak, which was the longest since November 2019.      The weekly gain confirmed a bullish breakout from a period of indecision signaled by the preceding week's doji candle. As such, one may expect the cryptocurrency to challenge resistance at $9,920. That level is currently housing a trendline connecting the December 2017 and June 2019 highs.      The daily chart MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend changes, is supporting the bullish case with an above-zero reading.      Options traders, too, are anticipating a bullish move, and look to be buying call options or bullish bets, as suggested by the negative one-month put-call skew. The three-month and six-month skews are also hovering below zero, according to Skew, a crypto derivatives research firm. The metrics indicate that calls are in greater demand that puts, or bearish bets.      The bullish case, however, would weaken if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance below $8,905, the low seen in the first week of July. Acceptance under that level would shift the focus to the 50-week moving average at $8,599.      At press time, bitcoin is trading largely unchanged on the day at $9,280.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/13/first-mover-twelve-fold-gains-for-aaves-lend-token-might-be-more-than-defi-hype,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e2a40cacfe52f092c1e123ad5d73d9ac7b9bc147-1200x882.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384083,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0SA5,1594641195,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Sets New Record High 2 Months After Halving,"Two months after the network's halving event, it's harder than ever to mine bitcoin.      Bitcoin mining difficulty, a measure of how hard it is to compete for block rewards on the network, just set a new record high of 17.35 trillion around 12:00 UTC on Monday. This marks a 9.89% jump from the previous record of 15.78 trillion posted on July 1, Bitcoin.com's blockchain explorer shows.      The new record comes a little over two months after bitcoin's halving on May 11, which reduced the block subsidy from 12.5 bitcoin per block to the current 6.25 bitcoin, per the network's design. The latest figure also surpasses the pre-halving high seen in early March.      The increase in difficulty reflects increasing computing power being applied to mining bitcoin. The record hashrate also seen Monday signals investment in state-of-the-art mining machines continues to grow after the halving, even though the price of bitcoin has remained stuck in a range between $9,100 and $9,500 since early July.      Bitcoin mining difficulty is designed to adjust every 2016 blocks, roughly every 14 days, and is based on the hashing power competing for rewards on the network over the period. If more miners have plugged into the network in any one cycle, pushing the average 14-day hashrate up, difficulty will subsequently rise in the next cycle.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      ""The increase in the network difficulty during the rainy season in Sichuan has happened every year for a few years now,"" said Dmitrii Ushakov, chief commercial officer at BitRiver, the largest bitcoin mining hosting provider in central Asia.      Ushakov said with the supply chain and business disruption resulting from the coronavirus pandemic completely resolved in China – estimated to have around 65% of the Bitcoin network's mining power – ""this has resulted in a surge in the number of miners that were shipped and delivered in the past two months and these miners are now online.""      But there's another force driving the Bitcoin hashrate's recent rebound. While many had expected prior to the halving that older-generation mining machines like Bitmain's AntMiner S9 would soon be phased out as they became unprofitable to operate, the reality may be more complicated.      Jiang Zhuo'er, CEO of BTC.TOP, a bitcoin mining pool based in China that also operates bitcoin miners, said by turning these older-generation devices to a low-voltage mode, one could improve the profit margin to keep them up and running.      With a low average electricity cost of around $0.03 in China's Southwestern region during the summer rainy season, a standard AntMiner S9 would be operating at loss with bitcoin's current price and record high difficulty. But available firmware updates could be applied to bring down its electricity consumption to improve the overall profit margin by 20%, a process called ""under-clocking.""      Also read: Inside the Craze for Filecoin Crypto Mining in China      While 20% may seem a significant margin increase, in terms of the actual profit, an under-clocked AntMiner S9 can only generate an almost negligible profit of less than $0.5 in 24 hours, even at an electricity rate of $0.03.      Part of why many still choose to operate older models, even without much profit, may be due to a surplus of newly built mining facilities since last year. Typically, bitcoin mining farm operators in China's southwestern region would sign agreements with hydro-power plants for a certain amount of electricity over a specified period.      ""So mining farms would lower down the offerings to below $0.03, even below $0.02 just so that they'd have enough machines to fill in the capacity,"" said Jiang, or even some would just mine themselves because they must pay the agreed electricity to the power plants whether or not they could use up the said amount.      Also read: China’s Rainy Season Is Coming. This Time Bitcoin Miners Aren’t Investing      ""Although it may look as if some old models are not profitable enough, in reality, they are not shutting down now,"" he said. Still, Jiang expects these older machines to be phased out after the end of the rainy season in China (around October) but throughout the summer the hash rate won't change too much if bitcoin's price remains static.      ""After that, the difficulty could go down because the hash rate coming from newly delivered, more powerful machines may not be able to offset the decline resulting from the shutdown of older-generation equipment like the S9,"" he added.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/13/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-sets-new-record-high-2-months-after-halving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88a2c6035958f99c5d621d7b0e2ebf3b4f2a593b-799x534.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Singapore's central banking authority and Temasek said Monday that with the fifth research cycle for project Ubin now complete, ""the next leap will be in implementing live commercial solutions to solve realworld challenges.""  Ubin has been running as a multi-currency payments platform and has leveraged work on a blockchain and digital currency at U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan.  Beginning in 2016 as a clearing and settlements initiative, Ubin's fifth phase (launched in November 2019), branched out to other areas including capital markets, supply chain finance and insurance.  The research found Ubin made complex financial transactions more efficient by lowering fees on foreign currency trading and cross border payments, as well as using smart contracts as a secure alternative to traditional escrow accounts.  The report says banks are now exploring whether Ubin can become the template for a commercial multi-currency platform for users to transact directly with one another.  If successful, it could even go on to form the basis for a global payments platform for central banks, the report added.  This was the last experimental phase to see MAS involvement, with Temasek saying it will support efforts to use Ubin for commercial ventures.  Ubin will continue running for the rest of 2020 as a test network for central banks and financial institutions to trial cross-border payments infrastructure.

42384092,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0SLP,1594627200,CoinSwap and the Ongoing Effort to Make Bitcoin Privacy 'Invisible',"A developer known for working on enhancing Bitcoin privacy has set his sights on a new project he hopes will ""massively improve"" how we keep our transactions private.      Chris Belcher, who also created the technical privacy market JoinMarket, is currently working on putting to the test CoinSwap, an idea first proposed by legendary Bitcoin developer Greg Maxwell in 2013. Belcher has been focusing on CoinSwap rather than JoinMarket because he thinks it will give users better privacy, he told CoinDesk.      Belcher recently received not just one, but two grants for his efforts, showing just how excited Bitcoiners are about the potential of the project.      Though the Bitcoin network arose from a privacy-minded movement, its privacy is actually pretty thin. Just take a look at any block explorer for a glimpse of how easy it is to pull up any transaction that's ever happened in Bitcoin's history – as well as the transaction's associated history.      Read more: Human Rights Foundation Funds Bitcoin Privacy Tools Despite ‘Coin Mixing’ Legal Stigma      ""Right now, Bitcoin privacy is not very good at all. Anyone in the world can analyze the blockchain and then can find all sorts of information about users - their balance, their history, who they transact with and in what amounts, when – everything they spend,"" Belcher told CoinDesk in an interview.      Belcher argues that this is, in some ways, worse than the financial privacy we have in legacy systems today. ""The banking system, they know your transactions, but the general public doesn't. With Bitcoin it is the general public -- it is everyone that can see exactly what the user does,"" Belcher added.      He added it's important to most people that this type of information isn't exposed to the whole world.      ""Financial privacy is good for human dignity, [for example], if you don't want your neighbors to see what charities you donate to or that type of thing, or if you're paid in bitcoin you don't want your employers to know what charities you donate to or what other activities you're involved in,"" Belcher added.    CoinJoins: today's Bitcoin privacy    ""CoinJoins"" (distinctive from ""CoinSwaps,"" which Belcher is putting to the test) are the privacy transactions that are most popular on Bitcoin today. CoinJoins give users good privacy and are becoming more popular. Thus far, they have been adopted in the Wasabi wallet, Samourai Wallet and JoinMarket.      A CoinJoin takes all inputs from several transactions by different users and mixes them into one big, collaborative transaction. This one big transaction then sends the bitcoins mixed from different addresses out to different addresses. Because no one can tell where the spent bitcoins originally came from, the scent of the trail is obfuscated and the participants in the CoinJoin gain better privacy.      Read more: What an Uptick in ‘Coinjoins’ Says About Bitcoin’s Value Proposition      But it’s not perfect. There are still ways for people analyzing the Bitcoin blockchain (namely blockchain analysis companies) to detect when and where bitcoins are being mixed.      For one thing, the transaction sizes of mixed coins are much bigger than normal transactions because they contain so many different inputs.      Also telling is the fact they have outputs that are all the same size. ""Equal output CoinJoins are very obvious. If someone sees them on the blockchain they can see that this kind of privacy protocol is happening,” Belcher said.      Why are outputs the same size? If Bob sends 0.8 BTC into the CoinJoin transaction and Alice sends 0.187 BTC and Mary sends 1.2222 BTC, and the resulting outputs are exactly 0.8 BTC, 0.187 BTC and 1.2222 BTC respectively, that coincidence is pretty obvious to anyone who is looking.      In order to preserve privacy, a CoinJoin transaction usually splits the amount of bitcoin dispensed into even pieces, say 0.1 bitcoin. So, if Alice put in 0.3 bitcoin, she will receive three 0.1 pieces sent to three separate addresses that she controls.      Most transactions don't have a bunch of equal outputs like this. That's why CoinJoins are easy to detect.      Indeed, there have been a few instances of cryptocurrency exchanges banning users who have evidently sent their bitcoin through such privacy services.      ""They'll be suspicious. If there's someone analyzing the blockchain, they'll see this is a CoinJoin, so they know this person did that. And if they see another transaction, [by comparison] they can see that it's not a CoinJoin,"" Belcher said.    CoinSwap: an invisibility cloak for transactions    ""CoinJoin"" and ""CoinSwap"" have similar names and they both help to preserve privacy, so it's easy to confuse them. But they're different, and Belcher argues CoinSwaps ""fixes many of the problems of some kinds of CoinJoins"" and ""is the next step for on-chain bitcoin privacy.""      CoinSwaps can be made to look invisible, Belcher said. If done correctly, a CoinSwap transaction can look just like a vanilla bitcoin transaction.      In a CoinSwap, it looks like two separate people are sending completely separate transactions. But under the hood, something else completely is happening.      Two parties, say Alice and Bob, execute such a swap. In short, Alice sends some bitcoin to a CoinSwap address. Bob sends the same amount of bitcoin to a separate CoinSwap address.      If both send the right amount of money over, the coins are ""swapped."" The coins Alice sent to the CoinSwap address are sent to a new address owned by Bob, and the coins Bob sent to his own CoinSwap address are sent to a new address owned by Alice.    'Teleporting' Coins    Under the hood, the CoinSwap address, which is responsible for this swapping, is much fancier than a normal bitcoin transaction. It's a multi-signature transaction, meaning it requires more than one person to sign off on it in order to send the transaction. Usually, these types of transactions stand out on the blockchain since they look different from normal bitcoin transactions. But by including ECDSA-2P cryptography, these multi-signature transactions can be made to look just like normal bitcoin transactions. This is very much Belcher's plan.      With ECDSA-2P in place, ""Alice sends a CoinSwap to Bob and it just looks like just a normal transaction. But actually the coins have ended up somewhere else completely,"" Belcher said.      This component is important. If all of these transactions look the same, people who aren't even using CoinSwaps are getting more privacy too. There's no way to tell if any transaction is a CoinSwap transaction or a normal one, turning bitcoin chain analysis on its head.      Read more: ‘Financial Surveillance’ or ‘Blockchain Analysis’? Human Rights Foundation Debates Elliptic      Similar technology will expand to the Lightning Network as well, so blockchain watchers can't tell if any single transaction is a CoinSwap, a Lightning Network transaction or just a normal bitcoin transaction.    ""CoinSwap could be said to allow bitcoins to teleport undetectably to anywhere else on the blockchain,"" as a description of the technology on the Bitcoin Wiki puts it. For a deeper explanation, check out this posthttps://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/coinswaps/ from JoinMarket developer Adam Gibson.    That's not to say that CoinSwap is perfect, though. The problem with CoinSwap is that it is a much more complicated process to implement than CoinJoin.    'As decentralized as possible'    In his mountain of a post, Belcher describes how to turn the idea of CoinSwap into reality.      A key reason CoinSwaps haven’t taken off since Maxwell described them seven years ago is that they're not as straightforward as CoinJoins. So, Belcher has his work cut out for him in implementing the complexity for the first time.      His first step was just thinking about the best way to do it, outlining a number of different design considerations in the article making up his plan of attack. For one, he plans to use the Rust programming language, since it's potentially more secure than other languages.      ""I want to make it as decentralized as possible, so there's no central point of failure that can be switched off or censored,"" Belcher said. To meet this goal, he wants the ""whole thing"" to run over the privacy network Tor, which helps to shield IP addresses, which are kind of like a mailing address for a computer exposing where it is located.      ""I think that's quite necessary for privacy,"" he said.      Read more: BTCPay Looks to Anonymize Bitcoin Transactions With PayJoin Integration      Belcher outlines this and various other considerations in his proposal, such as routing and using PayJoin, yet another bitcoin privacy technology, alongside it. Now that his ideas are out in the public, people can comment and make suggestions.      The next step is actually implementing it. Belcher told CoinDesk he hopes to release a minimum viable product in the next six months.

42384091,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0SGN,1594606500,Inside the Craze for Filecoin Crypto Mining in China,"As Filecoin inches closer to a blockchain mainnet launch – after several delays since its $200 million raise in 2017 – investors in China are again speculating heavily on the network’s mining hardware and its token prices.      Since Protocol Labs, the foundation behind Filecoin, released a “Testnet Incentives” program on June 9 that was scheduled to start in a week, more than a dozen Chinese companies have started selling cloud mining contracts and physical hardware – even though important details like the mining incentive economics on the mainnet are still not finalized.      The sales volume so far on each of these companies can range from half a million to tens of millions of dollars, according to self-reported data on these platforms seen by CoinDesk and interviews with several mining hardware manufacturers.      Filecoin's goal is to build a distributed storage network with token rewards to incentivize hosting storage as a way to push for wider adoption. Protocol Labs rolled out a testnet in December 2019. But tokens mined in the testing environment so far do not represent the real Filecoin that can circulate when the mainnet goes live. Further, the mining incentive economics on the testnet do not represent how the final block rewards will be available on the mainnet.      Still, data from Filecoin’s testnet blockchain explorers show that currently eight out of the top 10 miners with the largest effective mining power on the testnet are Chinese miners.      These eight miners have around 15 petabytes (PB) of effective storage mining power, accounting for more than 85% of the testnet’s total of 17.86 PB. For context, 1 petabyte of hard drive storage = 1,000 terabytes (TB) = 1 million gigabytes (GB).      The Filecoin craze in China may be largely related to the long-standing popularity of crypto mining in the country in general, which is home to around 65% of the computing power on Bitcoin by estimation. Plus, there has been much hype in China about Filecoin mining since 2018, with companies touting all sorts of hardware when the network was still in a development mode.      Read more: Bitcoin Miners Saw 23% Revenue Drop in June      “Crypto mining has always been a popular thing in China,” said Andy Tian, co-founder of 1475, one of the many Filecoin mining hardware manufacturers that's backed by notable Chinese VCs such as Fenbushi and Hashkey Capital.      “Even though Filecoin’s mining process is much more complex technologically, the idea of mining with hard drives instead of specialized machines like a Bitcoin ASIC miner may actually be much easier for retail people to understand,” he said.      Meanwhile, according to Feixiaohao, a Chinese service that is comparable to CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, nearly 50 Chinese crypto exchanges – mostly little-known ones along with some more notable ones including Gate.io and Biki – have listed trading pairs for Filecoin futures against USDT.      Since Filecoin’s mainnet is not yet live, the token traded on these exchanges is merely a future promise, with no clear visibility on how or when they can be settled when the network goes live.      Nevertheless, the total self-reported 24-hour trading volume on these exchanges on July 8 reached around $100 million, Feixiaohao data shows. And the prices for Filecoin futures have jumped up from around $11 in early June to around $28 on July 8 and are now down to $18 at press time.    Uncertain returns    In an Ask Me Anything hosted on June 25, Juan Benet, co-founder and CEO of Protocol Labs, confirmed the Testnet Incentives program will start on July 20 now that the testnet has been running for months, although it’s still unclear how exactly the economic incentives for Filecoin would work. But that could be delayed.      Asked when miners should expect to “get the detailed parameters for Filecoin’s crypto economic constructions,” Benet said Protocol Labs is finalizing the parameters, which will continue to evolve.      “We are looking to solidify more final parameters in late July. Let us know if you have more questions on the structural mechanisms themselves,” he told community members.      The incentive program invites miners to compete for 4 million Filecoin tokens that would be mined on the testnet, but would only be distributed after the mainnet goes live. The goal is to do a stress test for the network’s infrastructure ahead of its expected mainnet launch in August if there’s no further delay.      However, since July 11, the team have started gauging feedback from the community within its official Slack channel in terms of postponing the Testnet Incentives as well as the mainnet by potentially another one to two weeks.    Simply owning more hard drive storage does not necessarily equal more effective mining power on the network.    Although Filecoin testnet explorers currently show information about the total mined Filecoin at the testnet as well as each block’s reward, these numbers are at most a reference point as the finalized parameters are yet to be determined on the mainnet.      Therefore, as of this stage, investors buying either future-promised cloud mining contracts or physical hardware can’t be certain about the payback period for their investment with no clear equation to calculate a corresponding mining result on the mainnet.      “For now, [Filecoin] cloud mining is still a pseudo-proposition before all the incentive economics are finalized,” Tian said.      He said 1475 sells mining solutions and physical hardware as a whole but these machines could cost more than $30,000 per set in order to gain effective mining power. Partners who bought from them further sell computing power for around $300 per TB to retailers in the form of cloud mining contracts.      Mars Finance, a Chinese crypto media company invested in by Binance, for example, rolled out a cloud mining sales platform dubbed Mcloud.io. Apart from bitcoin mining contracts, it advertises several types of Filecoin cloud contracts, which tout an annualized rate of return of as much as 300% but do not indicate how much Filecoin can be mined with each TB of bought storage.    Buying in    Nevertheless, it appears these looming questions have not held back speculation in China, especially during a time when the bitcoin and cryptocurrency market have remained relatively static.      6block, one mining pool based in China, told CoinDesk it estimates multiple Filecoin mining pools have accumulated at least several hundred million yuan (over $15 million) worth of hardware and software for self-mining and selling to investors.      Some larger bitcoin mining farms in China, like RRMine, also started buying hardware to prepare for Filecoin mining and selling cloud computing contracts based on these hardware. The firm said it sold out more than $15 million worth of contracts within minutes in two of the four sale phases that started in June.      Even some Chinese crypto exchanges, such as BKEX and ZB, also partnered with Filecoin miner makers and claimed on their website that Filecoin cloud mining contracts worth over $1 million in USDT were sold out within minutes last month.      But there’s another nuance: Simply owning more hard drive storage does not necessarily equal more effective mining power on the network. This logic is different from bitcoin mining.      In bitcoin mining, at the current difficulty level, one terahash per second (TH/s) of hash rate is expected to generate roughly 0.000008 BTC in 24 hours. The more TH/s there is, the more bitcoin a miner should be able to produce proportionally.      Read more: Filecoin Is Mailing Out Hard Drives of Climate Data to Kick-Start Its File-Storage Network      But in Filecoin, a miner’s effective mining power depends on the volume of sealed data on a hard drive, not the total volume of a hard drive.      To seal data into a hard drive, a Filecoin miner still needs processing power, i.e. a CPU or GPU as well as ram. More powerful processors with more optimized software can seal data into a hard drive more quickly, so a miner can consolidate more effective mining power faster in a given day.      That resembles the idea of a customized personal computer with no exact specification standard, although Protocol Labs has a recommended specification for a starter.      “A huge volume of hard drive storage alone is not the point,” Tian of 1475 said. “What matters is the combination of hardware, i.e. core processors, ram, storage, and software optimization to determine the acceleration speed for you to accumulate effective mining power as time goes on.”      But as of this stage, there appears to be no transparent way at the network level for retail investors to see how much of their purchased storage hard drive is actually effective mining power.    Delays    Protocol Labs, which is headquartered in the U.S., was behind Filecoin’s 2017 initial coin offering, which raised a staggering $200 million.      That was in addition to a $50 million private investment raise backed by notable VCs including Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures. CoinDesk’s parent company Digital Currency Group also invested in Protocol Labs.      Colin Wang at The Force Partners, which has been mining Bitcoin for three years and followed Filecoin developments since 2018, also said that the idea of mining with a hard drive is more intuitive for ordinary investors to understand, although in reality the mining hardware is more than just a hard drive.      “Since 2018, there has been some Filecoin-related media coverage in China and so many machine sales companies have also been established,” he said.      But back then, Protocol Labs was still far away from rolling out the testnet – so there was a great level of uncertainty regarding a suitable mining hardware specification.      As the mainnet launch kept investors waiting, Wang said some Chinese companies had taken advantage of this information gap and used misleading claims to sell substandard machines to unwitting investors in China.      Wang went so far as to estimate that “uncodified mining machines may have sold for more than 30 billions yuan [$4 billion] in China” over the past two years.      Though an actual number may be hard to verify, such activities went rampant to the point that Protocol Labs issued an anti-fraud statement in December 2018, warning its Hong Kong and mainland China communities that it had no affiliation with any such miner sales and that investors should be wary of potential risks.      In one instance, local Chinese media reported in March 2019 that one self-claimed Filecoin hardware manufacturer allegedly exploited more than hundreds of people by an estimated $300 million for their fake Filecoin miners through an alleged multi-layer marketing scheme.      After rounds of delay, Protocol Labs said in September 2019 that the testnet launch would be live around December 2019 and the mainnet will be rolled out around Q1 2020.      The testnet did go live as promised, but the mainnet was once again delayed and is now expected to launch in August 2020.
