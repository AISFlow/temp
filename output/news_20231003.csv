18345364,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553995,1696375093,XRP Price Historical Data Suggests Substantial Q4 Rally Possible,"XRP price might have struggled to leave the $0.50 range over the last several months, even despite a victory in Ripple’s case with the SEC. But all that could change in Q4 2023, as the fourth quarter of the year is historically the most bullish for the altcoin. With this in mind, let’s dig into the data and see how Q4 stacks up against the historical performance of other quarters of the year. Plus, we’ll pin-point precisely which month is by far the most bullish of them all. Q4 Performance Is The Best Historically For XRP Price XRP price at the moment is trading at around $0.51 after a fierce rejection following Ripple’s big win in the case against the SEC. The altcoin was promptly relisted on top cryptocurrency exchanges, but it hasn’t led to the demand necessary to sustain higher prices. Related Reading: Select XRP Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond XRP Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond But that could change soon, now that Q3 is over and Q4 is here. The cryptocurrency is coming out of its worst quarter on average, so lack of performance isn’t too surprising. Q4, however, according to historical averages in performance across all quarters, is by far the most substantial. Q4 on average has provided an average of 30% ROI. Right behind it is Q2, posting roughly 22% ROI. Q1 averages a modest 13%, while Q3 comes in last with only 6% on average. There’s no guarantee this data will translate into returns during this last quarter of the year, but seasonality and serial correlation are common in finance and cryptocurrencies. Why It Could Take Til December For The Bull Run To Begin Unfortunately, October isn’t the beginning of a massive bull run the previous text makes it sound. While the data doesn’t lie — XRP price performs the best historically in Q4 on average, but Q4 represents October through the end of December. On a month-by-month basis, October is actually the third worst month on average. If the same positive seasonality in XRP were to follow along the data’s projections accurately, then it would also suggest that October might be another month of pain and sideways for investors. At an almost 12% gain in November on average compared to October’s 1.5% average decline, the second to last month of the year will turn things green. But even November isn’t quite the relief XRP holders would hope for. Related Reading: Bitcoin, XRP, & Ethereum: Three Top Coins On Brink Of Golden Cross That doesn’t arrive until December, which is by far and away the best month on average for XRP, with an 80% ROI on average. The one caveat, is that the majority of the returns occurred during the 2017 bull market, potentially skewing the results. Removing the outlier from the data would almost certainly change the results significantly. Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter. Sign up for free.

42392429,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6Ykt,1696374805,SEC’s Motion to Appeal Loss in Ripple Case Is Denied,"A federal judge has rejected the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s bid to appeal its ground-shaking loss against Ripple, the crypto company associated with the XRP token.  XRP’s price rallied about 5% on the news.  District Judge Analisa Torres said in a brief ruling Tuesday that the SEC had failed to meet its burden under the law to show that there were controlling questions of law or that there are substantial grounds for differences of opinion.  The decision isn’t a complete loss for the SEC, though. The judge set an April 2024 trial date for other issues that still need resolution. The agency may still try to appeal the overall case after.  The judge had previously ruled in July that while Ripple violated federal securities laws in selling XRP to institutionalinvestors directly, it had not done so by making XRP available to retail customers through programmatic sales to exchanges. That decision cast doubt on how strongly securities regulators would be able to police crypto.  The SEC announced after July’s ruling that it would file an interlocutory appeal and move to stay any further decision-making as it bid for an appeal court review of Judge Torres’ ruling.  Spokespeople for the SEC and Ripple did not immediately return requests for comment.

42392418,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6YG7,1696374196,Crypto-Friendly Congressman McHenry Temporarily Takes Over U.S. House,"Crypto-friendly Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) has landed in the driver’s seat of the U.S. House of Representatives just as legislation to establish digital-asset regulations nears a finish line there.  While House Republicans seek a permanent replacement for their just-ousted Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), McHenry will serve as McCarthy’s temporary replacement. The chairman of the House Financial Services Committee has been hard at work since last year on a number of crypto bills, and having McHenry in a leadership role over the entire House can’t hurt their progress.  One bill that would erect guardrails for U.S. stablecoins and another that would establish wide-reaching rules for the crypto markets cleared his committee and are expected to be brought up for floor votes as soon as next month. However, a House approval is only a half victory for the crypto sector if the resistant Senate doesn’t approve it.  Meanwhile, a discordant Republican caucus in the House will try to find a permanent speaker – a painful process that took 15 rounds of voting to put McCarthy into the role. The name of Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) has emerged among possible successors, which could be a major win for crypto.  Still, after Tuesday’s dramatic and unprecedented ouster of McCarthy, it’s uncertain how long Republicans will take to choose a new leader. The House almost immediately faces the next round of budget debates that will determine whether Congress can keep the federal government open for business. A shutdown would likely slow the already sluggish pace of digital-asset policymaking in Washington.

18344882,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553947,1696374002,Why You Should Pay Attention To The XRP Price Predictions,"Over the last month, a number of XRP price predictions have dominated crypto headlines. Some of these predictions have been greatly exaggerated, but there have been some that have come up on the more realistic side. Whether or not these XRP price predictions have been probable, there are some merits to actually paying attention to them. XRP Price Predictions Signaling Investor Outlook Price predictions are not new to crypto and they can often be a way to gauge how investors, especially traders are looking at a cryptocurrency. In recent times, the focus has mainly been on the XRP price, and with most of the predictions being bullish, it indicates widespread bullishness across the community. Related Reading: Brace For Impact As $200 Million In Crypto Is Being Unlocked In October A good portion of this bullishness can be attributed to Ripple’s win over the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) back in July. Following the ruling, the price of XRP jumped over 60%, reaching its highest point in a month. Even though the US SEC has contested Judge Analisa Torres’s ruling and filed an interlocutory appeal, it has not eliminated the long-term bullish outlook for the XRP price. This is because multiple legal experts have talked about the SEC’s interlocutory filing and the consensus has mainly been a low chance of success. Additionally, if Ripple were to emerge victorious in the interlocutory appeal as well, it would cement XRP’s status as a non-security. This would bolster the already renewed fate and signal the entrance of more institutional investors into the asset. XRP regains footing at $0.5 | Source: XRPUSD On Tradingview.com Looking At Some XRP Predictions Some XRP price predictions have been more realistic than others and those take precedence in this report. One of those is the 1,100% surge predicted by crypto analyst Dark Defender, who put the altcoin’s price at $5.85 in a couple of years. However, one analyst believes that the XRP price could rise as high as $25 following a 5,000% surge. While another analyst Oaksacorn put forward one of the most bullish predictions of XRP rising to reach the $250 level. Related Reading: LINK Price Primed For Meteoric Rise: Analyst Predicts 130% Rally To $18 For Wells Fargo Manager Shannon Thorp, XRP is primed for even greater heights. Thorp points to Ripple’s rising prominence in the cross-border payments sector and as the sector is expected to reach $250 trillion, she believes this could drive the XRP price to $500. All of these forecasts have varying timeframes for when the analysts expect them to play out. However, one thing they have in common is general bullishness toward the XRP price, especially when put into the perspective of long-term performance.

42392419,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6YAz,1696370888,"When SRM Shot Up in Value, Sam Bankman-Fried Changed the Rules for His Workers, Michael Lewis Says","Many FTX employees were set to become fabulously rich because their holdings of Serum’s SRM had shot up in value in 2021.  But that annoyed Sam Bankman-Fried, who had backed Serum, since that meant those employees might not be so willing to put in 14-hour days at his crypto exchange, since they were now paper multi-millionaires.  So, Michael Lewis explains in his new book, “Going Infinite,” the FTX CEO changed the rules, locking up those SRM tokens for longer so his employees had to wait to sell them.  Locked up compensation  Crypto firms and protocols often compensate employees by giving them some tokens, with the caveat that they are released to the employee on a set schedule. With highly liquid cryptocurrencies, it’s viewed as crucial that insiders not be able to dump them on retail investors as soon as the tokens start getting some traction.  Locked-up tokens give off the perception that the team is in for the long-haul. The exact schedule of these token unlocks is published as part of a project’s tokenomics.  Bankman-Fried changed the SRM rules  During the 2020-2021 bull market, SRM was a rising star. As CoinDesk reported at the time, it experienced significant price surges after being listed on Binance, with its success attributed to its affiliation with the decentralized exchange Serum on the Solana blockchain, and its association with Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX and Alameda Research.

18343305,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553952,1696370408,Can Bitcoin Continue Its Run? These Factors Could Suggest So,"Bitcoin has observed a pullback in the past day, but these factors may imply that the cryptocurrency’s rally can continue. These Factors Could Suggest A Bullish Outcome For Bitcoin A couple of days back, Bitcoin had started observing some sharp upward momentum, and by yesterday, the cryptocurrency had managed to breach the $28,500 level. In the past day, however, the asset has registered a decline, falling below the $27,500 mark. While it’s uncertain whether the rally is over or not, some signs can be optimistic for the investors. As explained by the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, two positive developments have occurred related to Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency sector. The first indicator of relevance here is the “USDT supply on exchanges,” which measures the percentage of the total circulating supply of the stablecoin in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin MPI Forms Death Cross, End of The Rally? Here is a chart that shows the trend in this Tether metric over the past year: It looks like the value of the indicator has been heading up in recent weeks | Source: Santiment on X Usually, investors store their capital in the form of a stablecoin like USDT whenever they want to avoid the volatility associated with the other assets in the sector. Such investors generally plan to go back into the volatile side of the market eventually, though, as they would have instead gone for fiat if they didn’t. Once these holders feel the time is right to dive into Bitcoin and other coins, they trade their stables for their desired cryptocurrencies. Naturally, such a shift provides a bullish boost to whatever assets they buy using their stablecoins. Investors generally use exchanges for conversions like these, so the current supply on these platforms can be considered potential dry powder ready to be deployed into BTC and others. The graph shows that the Tether supply on exchanges had plunged to a low of 17.6% a few months back, implying that the available buying pressure from the stablecoin had run out. Interestingly, this low in June had occurred in the leadup to a sharp Bitcoin rally, implying that the plunge in the exchange reserve of the stablecoin was, in fact, because of it being converted into the asset, thus providing the fuel for the surge. However, the rally back then couldn’t be sustained, as BTC eventually faced a struggle. Related Reading: Cardano To Shed Its Gains? Profit-Taking Spikes To High Levels In the months since this low, USDT reserves have slowly built back up on exchanges, as 24.7% of the stablecoin’s supply is now sitting on these platforms. Unlike that previous rally, it would appear that this latest surge has a store of potential buying power available that may be deployed at any time. In the chart, Santiment has also attached the data for another metric: the combined supply of the ten largest Tether whales. It would appear that these humongous investors have also increased their holdings during this period, implying that they also carry significant dry powder now. It now remains to be seen whether this stored-up USDT will be converted into the cryptocurrency to provide support to the surge in the coming days or not.

42392428,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6Z5P,1696369413,"Coinbase’s Attempt to End SEC Lawsuit Should Be Rejected, U.S. Regulator Argues","The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a motion asking that a federal judge rebuff arguments from crypto exchange Coinbase.  The debate hinges on how the judge might decide the proper way for interpreting the key precedent in securities law known as the Howey test.  U.S. regulators argued Tuesday that Coinbase Inc.’s attempt to toss out the securities law violation it faces should be rejected, asserting the crypto exchange’s justification contains “fatal flaws.”  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Coinbase (COIN) in June, saying the U.S.-based company failed to register as a securities exchange with the markets regulator. Coinbase has tried to get that case dismissed, asking the judge to make a pre-trial ruling that crypto changing hands isn't the same as an investment contract.  That should be ignored, the SEC said in a filing Tuesday. At stake is the court’s eventual interpretation of who is getting the so-called Howey test right: Coinbase, with its narrower view, or the SEC, which says Howey is meant to be flexible and widely interpreted when it defines a security that must be regulated by the SEC.  “This case turns on whether Coinbase intermediated transactions in ‘investment contracts’ and whether customers on Coinbase’s trading platform therefore were entitled to the protections afforded by the federal securities laws that require intermediaries of securities transactions to register with the SEC,” the regulator said.  Coinbase has argued that crypto trades don’t meet this definition of an investment contract, because no actual contract is established in a transaction.  “No court ever has held a formal contract is a prerequisite,” the SEC argued in its motion.  Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, called the SEC's contentions ""same old, same old"" in posts on X.com, the site formerly known as Twitter.  “The assets we list on our platform are not securities and are not within the SEC’s jurisdiction,” Grewal said. “Court decisions over the past several months have made that plain.”  The SEC has a different view.  “To distract from the fatal flaws in its legal arguments, Coinbase cries foul and seeks to blame the SEC for its current legal predicament,” the SEC said Tuesday. “It contends the SEC blessed Coinbase’s violative conduct when Coinbase went public, that SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s answer to a question at a Congressional hearing (which Coinbase distorts) controls this Court’s application of the federal securities laws, and that the SEC in any case lacks authority to regulate securities transactions that involve crypto assets.”  The U.S. securities regulator also pushed back on the argument that just because the agency allowed Coinbase to go public wasn’t an automatic endorsement that the trading on that platform conformed to securities laws.  “This lawsuit cannot really come as a surprise to Coinbase. It has known all along that a crypto asset bought and sold on its trading platform is a security if it meets the Howey test,” the court ruling that clarified the legal regime around what is and isn’t an investment contract.

42392420,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6YLF,1696368553,Could Sam Bankman-Fried's Saga Happen Without Crypto?,"Today is the beginning of Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial, and can already count as one of the most pivotal days in crypto history. Even if nothing majorly important is happening on the stand, yet. The reason why this trial of just one man matters for an industry is simple enough: SBF, as he was sometimes chummily called, has been elevated into a symbol for everything wrong with crypto. And there’s a lot to regret.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But it’s a mistake to say that Bankman-Fried is crypto in a nutshell, a representation of its inevitable dangers and excesses or Exhibit A of where this mostly unregulated industry will always end. That is, more or less, what New York Times crypto reporter David Yaffe-Bellany suggested in a recently co-published article: Crypto is on trial, as SBF faces a reckoning.  Per the NYT:  “It’s a fraud that was enabled and supercharged by crypto, and by crypto’s unique aspects,” said Lee Reiners, a crypto expert who teaches at Duke Law School. “It wouldn’t have been possible in any other context.”  This is an odd idea in a story that was largely just a summary of SBF’s journey through the legal system so far, but one that is probably widespread. Thankfully it’s easily dispelled by perhaps the person who groks the situation at FTX better than anyone, CEO and restructuring legend John J. Ray, who called SBF’s alleged theft of $8 billion “old-fashioned embezzlement.”  Crypto lends a patina of novelty to the situation, a sense that this is a crime only possible in the modern day, but the situation is fairly simple. SBF is accused of taking money that belonged to his customers and spending it on luxury real estate, gifts for mom and dad and vegan cheese. And his defenses are equally as classic: my girlfriend caused my financial problems, my lawyers are liars and “woops.”  But still, the idea that crypto is uniquely capable of causing a crime of this magnitude, is worth considering. Crypto is on the stand next to SBF, for better or worse, and played a pivotal role in his rise and fall — but is Sam Bankman-Fried a fair representative for a movement (of sorts) that spans industries, interests and the globe and has as many potential “use cases” as the dollars in your pocket?  Well, it’s true enough that SBF is as good a figurehead as any for “the unrestrained hubris and shady deal-making” that permeates the industry. But a centralized exchange that primarily grew by buying political clout is not exactly the vision Satoshi Nakamoto set out for Bitcoin. Is this a case of “no true Scotsman,” where “true crypto” has never been tried, or “affiliate marketing,” a parasitism of branding where bad products are sold through association to something better?  Unfortunately the reasoning behind Reiners’ bold claim that SBF couldn’t happen without crypto was cut out if it was ever given. Speaking on his behalf (I’ll try my best), it’s more than fair to say semi-pseudonymous, global money-printing machines that anyone can turn on enable misuse. In fact, crypto is abused for the same reason it’s used, these are undiscerning tools that have no need to know who is using them or why.  And that is the principle innovation behind crypto: digital money that has similar guarantees over privacy, ownership and fungibility as cash. Hence Bitcoin’s original tagline: digital cash. (People deeper down the crypto rabbit hole might add benefits like: empowering people to transfer and hold wealth like never before, defanging the Westphalian nationstate’s monopoly over money and the thing that will prevent poverty, war and social strife…if only it were widely adopted.)  So in a certain sense the question is: Could an SBF-sized empire operate through cash or the traditional financial system? I think the existence of the Sinaloa drug cartel would prove this to be the case, though it’s worth noting that some cartel members are apparently using Ethereum for money transfers.  See also: How Big Is Crypto Crime, Really?  And on the other end: does crypto, in particular, foster crime on the internet? As ransomware expert and reformed blackhat Marcus Hutchins once told me: ransomware existed before crypto, and it’ll exist even if every Bitcoin node is powered down. Take that as you will, but it seems likely if there are crimes to commit, money to finance it will be found.  Plus, has anyone ever given thought to the idea that internet crimes are growing because the internet itself is? This doesn’t explain away illegal securities offerings or rug pulls, but may explain why crypto is being used for crime in the first place, given that immutable, public ledgers are generally a thing criminals would avoid.  None of this is to downplay crypto’s role in Bankman-Fried’s story, only to complexify the idea that it was the only means to get to this end. Afterall, it’d be dishonest to claim crypto is a “revolutionary technology,” but disclaim the idea that it can have negative effects.  Other “unique aspects” of crypto Reiners might consider are social, like the norm in place where insiders take a cut of the projects they launch — also primed for exploitation (as opposed to Bitcoin’s “fair launch,” organized by Satoshi Nakamoto). Bankman-Fried, for instance, basically controlled the distribution of the exchange token FTT, which he used to underwrite loans and leverage his hedge fund Alameda Research to the hilt.  Likewise, crypto culture does not only enable crime, but fosters it. Thefts are expected, hitting the high and low, and hacks are a cost of doing business. It’s understood that bad actors are an appropriate price to pay to achieve financial privacy and personal sovereignty. Often people embrace the feeling of outlawness, the idea that this corner of their life will not be mediated by anyone along with the attendant responsibilities.  Bankman-Fried banked on all of this when building his empire, as well as perhaps the most foundational “meme” (used in the classic Dawkinian sense) in crypto: anything can have value if enough people say it does. Call this force FOMO, speculation or “number go up” “technology,” but it’s the principle reason why crypto prices move up (when they do) and why something like a CryptoDickButt NFT can have a price at all.  This collective dream machine is why there are so many crypto figureheads, like SBF, at one point, who do the job of articulating the crowd’s desires, demands and, yes, delusions — hopefully making it palatable enough to get the next greater fool involved — while also reassuring people that they’re betting alongside the smart money set. (Look at him, on stage with Bill Clinton: he has my interests in mind.)  All of this may sound like a fairly negative reading of crypto and its surrounding community (and in an article meant as a defense, no less). But, again, arguably, none of this is exclusive to crypto. The technological innovations in blockchain are like the technological innovations anywhere, and require human input to be put to good or bad ends.  This may be a tautology, but it’s a lesson humankind reckons with over and over and over again as it develops new tools. Plastics poison rivers and preserve food. Cracking the atom powers homes and leveled cities. To the extent that crypto is different, it’s that it has definitely caused societal harm but hasn’t yet found widespread use.  See also: The DeFi Financial Crime Arms Race  Sam Bankman-Fried’s alleged crime was old fashioned, and his purported motives were as ancient as Human Nature. Crypto was the conduit for his greed, but not the cause. He was someone who grew up hearing, literally, that actions have no consequences. And so, the container for his reckless ambition could have been anything: AI, quant trading, etc., so long as it was a high-growth industry to make and donate as much money as possible.  There were real economic costs to the collapse of Bankman-Fried’s empire, the total market capitalization of crypto has bled out about $1.9 billion since the day FTX declared bankruptcy. FTX’s convoluted corporate web and SBF’s industry-spanning relationships have meant the exchange was far from the only firm to go bust. Regulatory headway in the U.S. has stalled, in large part due to SBF’s obscene attempts to buy favor.  Yet, as fitting an example as Bankman-Fried is for the rot inside crypto, he’s a poor scapegoat for the industry’s failings. Crypto is on trial alongside Bankman-Fried, but the true crime would be if its truest believers missed this opportunity to judge itself. Lest another Sam Bankman-Fried will rise and fall again.

18341680,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553946,1696366847,3 Reasons Why Shiba Inu Price Might See A Massive Surge Over 400%,"Just like the rest of the crypto market, the Shiba Inu price saw an uptrend at the start of the week before correcting back downward on Tuesday morning. However, this decline may point to the meme coin gearing up for another rally that could see it rise more than 400% and there are reasons why. The Blessings Of October One of the first reasons that suggests a massive surge this month is how the asset has performed historically in the month of October. Looking back at previous years, the Shiba Inu price had shown incredible strength in October 2021 rising over 800%, which eventually led to its all-time high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Sparks Speculation As Cryptic Email, X Account Resurfaces Then in October 2022, the altcoin marked a double-digit rise even amid the start of a very bearish market. Although this was much smaller than its 2021 figures, it was significant nonetheless and registered October as a bullish month for the altcoin. Going by the average of both of these figures, analytics platform CryptoRank posits that the Shiba Inu price could rise over 400% this month if it sticks to its historical performance. Shibarium Continues To Grow The Shiba Inu Layer 2 blockchain, Shibarium, built atop the Ethereum network debuted in August. Following this, there have been some notable milestones for the network. One of these is the total number of transactions that have been carried out. Data from ShibariumScan shows that the network has now crossed 3 million transactions. Additionally, wallet addresses on the network are now more than 1.25 million. The total blocks produced are also inching closer to the 1 million mark with each passing day. These metrics point to a growing rate of adoption which could significantly impact the Shiba Inu price. This is because SHIB serves as the governance token of Shibarium and participants who want to be involved in governance will need Shiba Inu tokens to do so, increasing demand. SHIB maintains tight trading range | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com Shiba Inu Price Trajectory The Shiba Inu price has traded in a tight range between $0.0000071-$0.0000075, which suggests that the meme coin is finally finding a bottom. As a result, it could see a recovery using this point as a launch point and re-testing the resistance at $0.0000075. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Flip Bitcoin? Crypto Analyst Explains How If this resistance falls and bulls take control, it will be smooth sailing for Shiba Inu. Add in the recovering crypto market sentiment as shown by the Fear & Greed Index moving up into neutral. Shiba Inu will naturally follow the trajectory of Bitcoin and such a recovery would take it above $0.000008. At the time of writing, SHIB is sitting at $0.000007279 after falling 3.33% in the last day. Its market cap of $4.2 billion makes it the 18-largest cryptocurrency in the industry.

Furthermore, a recent report by The Wall Street Journal report by The Wall Street Journal, it was revealed that the launch of the first Ethereum exchange-traded funds on Monday generated little interest from small investors. These ETFs provided individual investors access to the second-largest cryptocurrency through brokerage accounts. However, per the report, most of the futures-based Ether ETFs ended the day in the red, with a combined trading volume of less than $2 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin News: Revival Of “Satoshi Nakamoto” Account Could Signal Slump In BTC Price? Red Flags For Ethereum ETFs? The Ether ETFs, offered by prominent asset management firms such as ProShares, VanEck, and Bitwise Asset Management, are entering a highly competitive market. Experts believe these funds will have to compete fiercely in cost and marketing strategies to attract investors amidst the crowded landscape. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, expressed his concerns regarding the funds, stating: A lot of these funds are going to struggle to get assets. There’s probably only room for one stud in this race. During a Bloomberg TV appearance, Balchunas emphasized the relatively low trading volume of the Ethereum ETFs compared to BITO, a Bitcoin (BTC) ETF that tracks the price of BTC using Bitcoin Futures launched in 2021. Notably, the trading environment for the first futures-based Ether ETFs differs significantly from the first futures-based Bitcoin ETFs. ProShares’ initial Bitcoin ETF (BITO) debut, which took place during the peak of the crypto bull market, was one of the most highly traded ETF launches ever. Conversely, on the inaugural trading day of Ether future ETFs, the value traded amounted to nearly $1.9 million by noon, with Valkyrie emerging as the frontrunner in the race for Ether futures ETFs. Initially focused on Bitcoin futures and later expanded to include Ether, the fund experienced a 3.9% increase. VanEck’s EFUT managed to generate some volume by launching ahead of its competitors. However, volumes quickly dwindled, with a staggering 49% of EFUT’s daily volume occurring within its first trading minute. Disappointing Launch Day For Futures-Based ETH Senior analyst of k33 research, Vetle Lunde, suggests that this lackluster launch points to more choppy market conditions ahead. The highly anticipated launch day failed to meet market expectations, reminiscent of the underwhelming debut of Bakkt. This sheds light on a seemingly “non-existent” demand for additional crypto exposure, indicating a continuation of the current consolidation range in the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Gold Poised For Growth Amidst US Fiscal Troubles, Top Macro Investor Says In defense of the lackluster ETF launch, it is worth noting that activity in crypto ETFs has been consistently shallow in recent months. BITO, for example, has witnessed consistent outflows since mid-July and experienced its third-lowest average daily volume (ADV) in September 2023, surpassed only by volumes in August and December 2022. The Ethereum futures products launched on Monday, along with their respective net expense ratios, include: BitWise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) – 0.85% Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP) – 0.85% ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) – 0.95% ProShares Bitcoin & Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BETE) – 0.95% Bitcoin & Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF (BETH) – 0.95% VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) – 0.66%. The disappointing debut of futures-based ETH ETFs underscores the challenges in generating substantial investor interest in crypto ETFs. As the crypto market continues to evolve, market participants will closely monitor developments and assess the impact on investor sentiment and the future of crypto ETFs.

Alongside the criminal case, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) also sanctioned the list of Chinese nationals on Tuesday, identifying 16 associated crypto wallets in the action.  “We have identified and blocked over a dozen virtual currency wallets associated with these actors,” said Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo, in a press conference. “The blocked wallets, which received millions of USD funds over hundreds of deposits, illustrate the scope and scale of the operation targeted today.”  The DOJ cracked down on the Florida network of 28 businesses and individuals it said was involved in producing fentanyl and methamphetamine and the sale of precursor chemicals used to make the illegal drugs.  “These companies tend to use cryptocurrency transactions to conceal their identities and the location and movement of their funds,” according to a DOJ statement.  The connection between crypto and the fentanyl trade has drawn heavy attention, including from Sen.

This substantial transaction, involving a jaw-dropping 425 billion SHIB tokens, has raised eyebrows within the cryptocurrency community. The timing of this move couldn’t be more intriguing, as Shiba Inu has been experiencing a rollercoaster ride alongside the broader crypto market. Shiba Inu’s recent price action has been nothing short of dramatic. It surged in tandem with other cryptocurrencies but is now confronting significant resistance. The pivotal 50 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) level stands as a crucial test for the token’s short-term trajectory. Related Reading: Crypto Era Looms: BIS Innovations Chief Calls On Central Banks To Prepare Should SHIB fail to break through this resistance, a potential trend reversal could be on the horizon, possibly catalyzed by large-scale sell-offs, much like the mammoth transaction to Coinbase. Although $3.2 million might not be a tidal wave in SHIB’s liquidity pool, it does invite some intriguing queries about the grand designs of prominent SHIB holders. Could this financial maneuver be a harbinger of a broader pattern in the making? It’s entirely conceivable that these crypto behemoths are seizing the opportunity presented by recent profits, especially given SHIB’s impending clash with a pivotal resistance threshold. This transaction could serve as an early indicator of a more extensive trend in the SHIB community. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, and major holders often wield considerable influence. Thus, when they make a move of this magnitude, it can trigger a domino effect, influencing other traders and shaping market sentiment. Moreover, the timing of this transaction is noteworthy. SHIB is approaching a critical resistance level, a juncture where its price could either break through to new highs or face a substantial pullback. SHIB’s Current State And Burn Program As of now, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00000730, as per CoinGecko data, reflecting a 3.8% decline in the past 24 hours. Over the course of the last seven days, SHIB has managed to eke out a marginal gain of 0.1%. These price fluctuations highlight the volatility that has become synonymous with meme tokens like SHIB. Interestingly, amid these price swings, the Shiba Inu burn rate has returned to the green zone. Nearly 95 million SHIB tokens were burned in the last 24 hours, underscoring the unwavering commitment of the SHIB community to the burn program. This program aims to reduce the substantial circulating supply, which has often been blamed for the token’s lackluster price performance. SHIB market cap currently at $4.2 billion. Chart: TradingView.com According to a price report, the total number of SHIB tokens obliterated now stands at 410 trillion. This impressive feat has brought the total supply down from 999 trillion to 589 trillion SHIB. Currently, approximately 10 billion SHIB tokens are locked in staking contracts, leaving the circulating supply at around 580 trillion. Shiba Inu: Potential Price Impact The recent influx of SHIB tokens onto Coinbase and the ongoing burn program’s success are sure to keep investors and crypto enthusiasts on the edge of their seats. The question of whether SHIB can surmount its resistance and sustain its rally remains unanswered.

The book says Jump was “near the top” of the list of FTX’s 50 “biggest accounts whose owners had been unable to remove their money from the crypto exchange,” Lewis wrote. Jump Trading lost $206 million while its affiliated trading firm, Tai Mo Shan Ltd., lost more than $75 million, according to the book, which cited documents discovered by Constance Wang, ex-chief operating officer of FTX.  A Jump spokesperson replied “no comment” when contacted by CoinDesk.  If accurate, the book underscores the heavy blow Jump endured when FTX collapsed in November. FTX filed for bankruptcy in November and in a court filing revealed that its top 50 creditors, excluding insiders, said they were owed $3.1 billion by the exchange. The largest single claim was $226 million, followed by a $203 million claim. The creditors’ names were redacted.  Read CoinDesk's full Sam Bankman-Fried trial coverage.

Michael Lewis's book on Sam Bankman-Fried, 'Going Infinite'  According to Michael Lewis’s new book, ""Going Infinite,"" O’Leary was paid $15.7 million by FTX for “20 service hours, 20 social posts, one virtual lunch and 50 autographs.”  The usefulness of O’Leary as a spokesperson was questioned by some FTX executives, including Constance Wang, its former chief operating officer, according to the book.  “Investing is a social network. It makes no sense but it is,” is how Bankman-Fried explained it, who also allegedly tried to hire CNBC’s Jim Cramer, according to Lewis. “One million people follow O’Leary, and they follow him for his financial advice.”  “It’s shocking, but it’s true,” he continued.  Promoting another crypto exchange  During the interview with CoinDesk TV, O’Leary mentioned a crypto exchange called M2 based in Abu Dhabi and recently licensed by local regulators in August.  During a separate appearance on Fox Business Network, he also mentioned M2, calling it “totally compliant, backed and incredibly stable that can be used by anyone on a compliant basis.""  The remarks were so positive that last week M2 recirculated the clip from its own account on X (formerly Twitter).  O’Leary said he hasn’t yet been “invited to invest” in the exchange, nor is he being paid by them.  Last year, O’Leary appeared in a commercial for Abu Dhabi Global Market, the Emirate’s international financial center, called “Abu Dhabi Where Ambitions Thrive.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/03/tvs-kevin-oleary-all-the-crypto-cowboys-are-going-to-be-gone-soon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae2345eb0e0e184f4fc4e215be994166d18e80b1-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18336881,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553920,1696356031,Twitter IPO: Dogecoin Takes Center Stage In Elon Musk’s X IPO Rumors,"The crypto community is buzzing with excitement as rumors spread about a possible collaboration between the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management and Elon Musk’s X. Ackman’s desire to potentially work with X has grabbed the attention of investors, raising questions about the possible impact on the cryptocurrency market, specifically on digital coins like Dogecoin. Ackman Signals Willingness To Strike Deal With Musk’s X According to reports from The Wall Street Journal, Bill Ackman, an American Billionaire hedge fund manager and founder and CEO of Pershing Square, has stated his interest in striking a deal with Elon Musk’s recently rebranded X social media platform. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer Reveals The Impact Of SEC’s Lawsuit Against Ripple When asked by The WSJ if he would be interested in enacting a deal with X, Ackman responded by saying “Absolutely.” The American billionaire has been an avid user of X platform, amassing almost 800,000 followers and broadcasting his views on various global topics and issues. The Pershing Square CEO also recently disclosed the regulatory approval of its unique investment vehicle, SPARC by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), allowing the financial vehicle to target and invest in privately held firms and move them into a public domain. Ackman announced in an X post, urging private companies looking to go public to consider Pershing Square as an investor. “If your large private growth company wants to go public without the risks and expenses of a typical IPO, with Pershing Square as your anchor shareholder, please call me. We promise a quick yes or no,” Ackman stated. Although Ackman has revealed his willingness to potentially collaborate with X, Musk has not released any acknowledgment or confirmation of Ackman’s statement. Investors, however, are curious about the potential influence the alleged collaboration would have on Dogecoin cryptocurrency. DOGE price struggles to hold $0.06 | Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview.com What Does This Mean For Dogecoin? The speculation about X’s dealing with Ackman’s investment vehicle has led to whispers about potential market changes and possibilities for Dogecoin. Since Dogecoin is known to be highly favored by Musk, who is believed to be one of the largest investors of the cryptocurrency, industry investors see the possibility of cooperation between Ackman and X driving Dogecoin’s market price toward a $0.75 mark. There have also been previous speculations that Musk would implement DOGE payments as he deploys X bots in his new X payment plans. Related Reading: Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Sparks Speculation As Cryptic Email, X Account Resurfaces Crypto enthusiasts and industry investors have seen Musk’s heavy influence on the price of Dogecoin over the years and are looking forward to the changes the cryptocurrency would have if rumors of Ackman’s alignment with X come to fruition. Currently, the price of Dogecoin is trading at $0.062 with a 24-hour trading volume of over $238 million. The cryptocurrency is presently facing a bullish uphill climb to the $0.07 mark, however, market metrics have revealed challenges in Dogecoin’s upsurge.

42392434,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6ZV3,1696353735,Why Intel Exchanges Raise a Dilemma for Compliance,"Intel exchanges have arrived — and with them, a dilemma for compliance.  This summer, a $670 bounty was placed on information identifying Elon Musk’s personal crypto wallet. The reward is offered through Arkham’s Intel Exchange launched in July, which critics have nicknamed “DOX-to-Earn.” The platform encourages users to reveal the identities behind otherwise anonymous blockchain addresses, with crypto payable in Arkham’s native token (ARKM).  Marina Khaustova is the CEO of Crystal Blockchain. Prior to Crystal, Marina was CMO and co-founder of Element Capital Group, a digital finance-focused investment bank and asset manager for emerging blockchain industry capital markets.  While all on-chain information is visible, public forums can be a questionable source for data, and will require multiple verifications, including off-chain methods. Wrong conclusions can be drawn otherwise, putting the integrity of blockchain analytics, and even legal systems, at risk.  As the blockchain industry matures alongside institutional adoption and regulatory clarity, analytics providers need to ensure investigations are done carefully and with even more integrity. With consumer-focused analytics tools allowing any Twitter sleuth to play detective, the stakes are higher for those actors entrusted by public authorities to investigate money laundering, fraud, and criminal activity with real national security implications.  All Eyes on Blockchain’s Surveyors  In a twist of irony, forensics firms — the teams tasked with silently ensuring the integrity of decentralization — have been thrust into the spotlight. In April, a Dutch court allowed Alexey Pertsev, the developer of the Tornado Cash mixer who was sanctioned by the U.S. government last year, to cross-examine Chainalaysis at trial later this year.  Pertsev’s lawyers have argued that on-chain Ethereum transactions cited in evidence did not exist, setting a blockchain analytics company up for a grueling back-and-forth in which even one inconsistency can derail the state’s case, even if all other facts are ironclad. Furthermore, a hypothetical inconsistency can also be used in future legal defenses to undermine an entire process and industry.  Read more: Arkham CEO Defends ‘DOX-to-Earn’ Program, Says Public Blockchains ‘Worst’ for Privacy  Companies or individuals relying on public forums like intel exchanges with opaque verification techniques. The industry should not be using public boards with public wallet addresses for compliance decisions.  Blockchain analytics providers carry a tremendous weight of responsibility in ensuring their data is credible. All analysis carries potential legal outcomes, and the ability to alter someone’s life in the case of criminal indictments by law enforcement. Just because blockchain transactions are public does not mean it is easy to make real-world connections. Accepting any claim of ownership is not enough: Thorough vetting, both on and off-chain, is required.  Inflection Point  The blockchain industry is at an inflection point. The rise of intel exchanges and “crypto bounties” has the potential to bring a surge of digital withhunts, and even accelerate L2s and privacy coins. The issues intel exchanges face are human rights issues, wherein their service bears more semblance to a publisher than a blockchain startup, and leadership will inevitably have to arbitrate what should and should not exist on their platforms.  Forensics firms can correct this course by ensuring audit trails are unquestionable in accuracy and integrity, reaffirming the public’s faith in legal institutions and cryptocurrency as a tool for social good.",NEUTRAL,ARKM,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | ARKM,Marina Khaustova ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/03/why-intel-exchanges-raise-a-dilemma-for-compliance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a401a738cda9b0e7b2fe5a4fe79909c4a96dcdaf-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18335410,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553896,1696352439,Cardano To Shed Its Gains? Profit-Taking Spikes To High Levels,"On-chain data shows the profit-taking among Cardano investors has spiked to high levels, a sign that the asset may register a decline in the coming days. Cardano Has Observed High Profit-Taking After The Rally According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, AAVE, ADA, and CRV are among the altcoins that have recently observed the most extreme profit-taking. The relevant indicator here is the “ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss,” which, as its name suggests, tells us about how the profit-taking volume of any cryptocurrency compares with its loss-taking volume. This indicator works by going through the on-chain history of each sold coin to see what price it was last moved at. If the previous selling price for any coin was more than the current value it’s being moved at, then its sale contributes to the loss volume. Similarly, the sale would count under the profit volume if it were otherwise. Related Reading: Bitcoin MPI Forms Death Cross, End of The Rally? When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the profit-taking volume is more than the loss-taking volume right now. On the other hand, negative values suggest the dominance of the loss-taking volume. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this indicator for Cardano, Aave, and Curve over the past month or so: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high for all three of these coins in recent days | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the indicator appears to have observed a large spike recently for all three of these altcoins. During the peak of this surge, the metric’s value had been among the highest levels observed in the year so far. This interest in profit-taking occurred after these cryptocurrencies had observed their respective rallies, following Bitcoin’s surge beyond the $28,000 mark. This extreme profit-taking spree has hit Curve the hardest, as the cryptocurrency has plunged almost 7% during the past day. Cardano has held onto some of its recoveries, as the decline has only been about 2%. Aave has not felt any negative effects from this profit-taking, as the cryptocurrency price has mostly continued to move sideways in the past day. While ADA has shown some strength against the profit-taking, it’s still a concerning sign for the asset that its modest recovery rally has instigated such an extreme reaction from the market. Related Reading: Chainlink Signal That Preceded Crashes Of 34% Is Back It would seem possible that some of the investors had been waiting for an exit opportunity, however small, and once they got it in the form of this surge, they swiftly sold their coins. If the profit-taking continues in the coming days, Cardano may retrace more of its recovery.

42392421,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6Yad,1696352417,No Sam Bankman-Fried Jury Yet; Judge Expects to Cull 50 Prospects Quickly on Wednesday,"NEW YORK — Sam Bankman-Fried must wait a bit longer to find out which 12-18 New Yorkers will hold his fate in their hands – but he does not face the death penalty, the judge overseeing his case reassured a potential juror.  The first day of the FTX founder’s trial adjourned Tuesday without a jury being seated, though a few dozen prospective jurors were excused. Around 50 people were left in the pool at the end of the day, Judge Lewis Kaplan said before dismissing the remaining prospects in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Twelve jurors and six alternates will be picked Wednesday morning, and the judge said he expects opening arguments to begin shortly after.  As he has been in most previous hearings, Bankman-Fried was present Tuesday, wearing a suit and sporting a haircut sans his trademark curly mop. Unlike his last court appearance, he was not shackled walking in. He spent most of the day on a laptop conferring with his attorneys.  The one-time power broker of the cryptocurrency industry is accused of conducting what prosecutors have characterized as one of the largest financial frauds in history. His twin crypto companies FTX and Alameda collapsed last November after customer withdrawals exposed an $8 billion hole in their balance sheets. He could face decades in prison if convicted.  The trial itself will likely begin Wednesday after jury selection – voir dire – wraps up. The prosecution expects a roughly 25-30 minute opening statement, while the defense anticipates taking 35-40 minutes. The first witnesses should take the stand later in the day.  Most of Tuesday was spent weeding out prospective jurors based on their response to general questions ranging from their religious beliefs and physical disabilities to potential financial hardships that could complicate their participation in the trial estimated to last six weeks. Several revealed that they or loved ones lost money investing in crypto, including one whose twin brother was nearly ruined.  “Did you make money or did you lose money,” Kaplan asked one prospect. “Lost money,” the prospect chuckled in response. Another said her fiancé invested some of their money in cryptocurrency. “Win or lose,” queried Kaplan. “Lose,” she responded.  No prospective jurors said they made money in crypto. One young man said he was fundamentally against crypto without explaining why. Another insisted “I don't understand cryptocurrency” despite his son’s attempts to teach him. He then gave Bernie Madoff a shoutout.  Other questions included potential bias about the use of cooperating witnesses – which include Bankman-Fried’s former romantic partner Caroline Ellison, early Alameda Research hire Nishad Singh and the hedge fund’s co-founder Gary Wang – and whether jurors had strong views on the policies regarding the charges against Bankman-Fried.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon also rattled off a number of other names of potential witnesses or people tied to the case, including former FTX executives Sam Trabucco, Ryne Miller, Ryan Salame and Mark Wetjen, and Bankman-Fried’s parents – Barbara Fried and Joseph Bankman.  Nicholas Roos, one of the federal prosecutors, said Bankman-Fried was never offered a plea deal.  Before the prospective jurors walked in, the judge told Bankman-Fried: ""You have the right to testify in your defense in this case,” even if his lawyers don’t want him to.  It remains unclear whether Bankman-Fried will do so. He’s been vocal about his innocence in the past.  Moments from the trial  One odd moment saw a juror who knew of FTX through work tell Judge Kaplan she couldn’t reach a guilty verdict if the punishment for Bankman-Fried included a death penalty. While jurors are instructed to render their judgements irrespective of the convict’s resulting punishment, Judge Kaplan broke that norm to assure her that death was not on the table in a financial crimes case.  Another juror said she had to travel to attend a wedding later in the month.  “How close is the relationship between you and” the person getting married, Judge Lewis Kaplan asked the prospective juror. She responded: “My husband’s co-worker.”  Another said she was flying to Maui for six months. “You’re a courageous soul,” the judge quipped before asking for additional context.  When Kaplan asked if any of the jurors came to court on Tuesday with “personal knowledge” of Bankman-Fried, several raised their hands in the affirmative. When questioned individually, most of these people recalled learning about the case in the media.  One member of the jury pool said he’d listened to “a podcast of someone who studied this particular case.” What podcast? “Joe Rogan,” said the juror.  Kaplan also probed the jury pool on whether they had any biases that would make it difficult for them to be impartial. “I’m not sure how unbiased I could be about crypto given how negative I feel about it,” said one prospective juror.

42392432,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6ZPv,1696352103,AI Is the Key To DeFi Liquidity,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been nothing short of a miracle. For the first time ever, anyone with a simple internet connection can build wealth digitally. People in all parts of the world, regardless of their financial status or location, are bettering their lives through DeFi by making the same kinds of investment decisions previously limited to professionals. Not to mention that DeFi is cheaper and more transparent than traditional methods of financial transactions.  Former U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker once famously quipped that the only financial innovation he could think of that actually improved people’s lives was the ATM. I would add DeFi to that short list.  Emin Gun Sirer is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Ava Labs.  Traders are noticing the benefits: aggregate DeFi revenue is expected to grow at almost 20 percent annually through 2027. DeFi’s Total Value Locked is roughly $63 billion, and reached as high as $200 billion during the last bull market.  Like any new technology, however, DeFi’s growth has come with its share of painful experiences, which have kept many would-be participants on the sidelines. But remarkable progress in artificial intelligence (AI) gives me hope that it will be the catalyst for DeFi to continue its evolution.  In my opinion, many of the impediments to broader DeFi adoption can be lumped under the term “liquidity” – the ease with which an asset or security can be converted into cash at market price. Liquidity is a complex, multidimensional issue, but, fundamentally, it’s simply about enough people wanting something that it makes buying and selling as simple as a click.  AI can improve liquidity in the DeFi market. While DeFi is global, more can still be done to encourage adoption, as there are many barriers to understanding like language and coding fluency. If a DeFi protocol’s documentation is written only in English, for example, it’s certainly more difficult for non-native English speakers to engage with the technology. This is where AI-powered Large Language Models (LLMs) come into play: LLMs can be used to instantly translate documentation into different languages, as well as provide “live” customer support for the whole world. LLMs will make DeFi truly global.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - Is Crypto-AI Really a Match Made in Heaven?  LLMs will also be crucial to solving another of DeFi’s biggest challenges: regulatory compliance.  Country by country, the policies and regulations applicable to DeFi are, to put it mildly, fragmented. Yes, DeFi is a very new and complex field, so the situation is somewhat understandable, but analyzing and adopting many different, and ever-changing, rules makes compliance a big challenge. That said, regulatory compliance is a must so that people and businesses feel comfortable their DeFi activities fall within relevant laws.  Already, governments have taken action against several DeFi entities, as well as individuals using them, for failing to adhere to various money transmission statutes. In order to preserve the integrity of the industry as a whole, we need LLMs’ help to process the immense amount of policy and regulatory information, and flag where there are outstanding issues so they may be resolved posthaste.  AI can address DeFi’s security issues.The risk of hacks and exploits is the general public’s chief concern about DeFi.

Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges levied by U.S. prosecutors in a trial that starts Tuesday. The legal complaint filed against CNA said he is also involved in a dozen civil and regulatory actions relating to his collapsed crypto exchange FTX.  CNA, also known as the Continental Casualty Company, has “unjustifiably failed to make timely payment on Mr. Bankman-Fried’s claims as required by the Policy,” said the filing, adding that those alleged breaches “have caused, and threaten to cause, substantial and irreparable harm to Mr. Bankman-Fried for which there is no adequate remedy at law.”  His CNA policy has a limit of liability of $5 million, kicking in when an underlying $10 million policy is exhausted, the document said. The filing makes clear the mounting financial cost of litigation for Bankman-Fried since FTX declared bankruptcy in November 2022.  After being arrested in December, he was originally released on bail on a $250 million bond, that was eventually revealed to have been co-signed by his parents and two family friends linked to Stanford University.  In a January Substack post, Bankman-Fried suggested he would be willing to surrender some $500 million worth of Robinhood shares in return for access to FTX’s directors and officers (D&O) insurance policy for executives, though those assets have now been confiscated by the Department of Justice.

Bitcoin SV (BSV) recorded an 8% 24-hour price increase, while Bitcoin succumbed to bearish pressure, dipping nearly 3% today, October 3. As a result of today’s uptick, BSV now trades at $40.4, representing an 8% increase in the last 24 hours. Also, the token has recorded over 31% seven-day increase, regaining over 34% of its past month’s gains. Related Reading: Solana Outperforms 2 Top Altcoins – Its Ripple Effect On Prices These prominent strides confirm buyers’ dominance in the BSV market today. However, given the bearish state of the general crypto market, how long can BSV sustain this rally? What factors triggered this dramatic surge? Let’s find out. Bitcoin SV Price Surges Amidst Controversy Surrounding CEO’s Resignation BSV price gains correlate with the sudden resignation of nChain’s CEO, Christen Ager-Hanssen, on September 29. nChain is a firm that offers blockchain-based services related to the BSV chain. Its former CEO, Ager-Hanssen, immediately announced his departure from the group on September 29. Ager-Hassen mentioned reporting several issues to the nChain board, which included a conspiracy to defraud shareholders. He also stated that a significant shareholder orchestrated the conspiracy. Further, he claimed to discover evidence that BSV creator Dr. Craig Wright manipulated documents to deceive the court that he was Satoshi. However, Bitcoin SV’s supporter Calvin Ayre reviewed Anger-Hanssen’s departure. According to Ayre, Anger-Hanssen has never run a successful company and lies to steal assets Notably, Bitcoin SV sparked to life after nChain released a statement that Stefan Matthews would take over as acting CEO. Recent Tweet By Supposed Bitcoin Founder Boosts Investor Sentiment On BSV Another event that occurred around BSV was an October 2, 2023, tweet from an account claiming to be Bitcoin’s founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. Interestingly, the last tweet from this account was on October 31, 2018. According to a recent tweet, Nakamoto stated that Bitcoin is a predicated machine. He revealed his desire to explore other aspects of the project not contained in the whitepaper. The tweet attracted positive reactions, with one user stating that the first post since 2018 has to mean something. Since Bitcoin BSV supposedly aligns with the original Bitcoin vision, it benefited from this sentiment. The reactions likely increased investor confidence, leading to massive token demand and today’s 8% uptick. Although the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto and his involvement in this saga remains a mystery, these controversies positively affected BSV’s price. What Next For BSV? BSV has flipped the $32.6 resistance into support to form a large green candle on October 2. It faces the next resistance at the $40.4 price level. A break above this level will likely send BSV up to $42. Since the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the overbought zone at 81.9, it confirms the strong buying pressure pushing BSV up. Nevertheless, traders should expect a slight retracement in the coming days once the buyers begin to make a profit.

42419480,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEfHh,1696348800,"At Last, Blockchain Developer OP Labs Delivers ‘Fault Proofs’ Missing From Core Design","When the crypto developer OP Labs rolled out software a year ago making it easy for companies to spin up their own distributed networks atop the Ethereum blockchain, the option quickly became so popular that it attracted the likes of the big U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase, which used the platform to build its new blockchain, Base.  But in recent months, technical experts have homed in on a crucial deficiency of the setup: that networks based on the OP Labs software were missing an element known as “fault proofs” that are theoretically at the very core of their operations.  OP Labs officials have repeatedly said that getting fault proofs into operation was a top priority – so much so that the project even had its own name, “Cannon.” The lack of the security feature has been likened to driving a fast car without airbags.  On Tuesday, OP Labs took its first step toward addressing the concerns, launching fault proofs on a test network known as OP Goerli Testnet.  Fault proofs, sometimes known as fraud proofs, are at the core of optimistic rollup technology, a system for connecting layer-2 blockchains or ""rollups"" to primary layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum; the tech is used to “prove” that certain data from the rollup can or cannot be trusted.  But projects that rely on the technology are still in varying states of adolescence. Arbitrum, another optimistic rollup, currently relies on roughly a dozen designated validators to handle fraud proofs, but is pushing to broaden that out so that it’s a “permissionless” system.  Optimism, a layer-2 blockchain atop Ethereum that served as the template for OP Stack’s software, previously had released fault proofs on its main network, but removed them due to security concerns, Karl Floersch, the CEO of OP Labs, told CoinDesk in an interview.  “Essentially, what we did was we ended up building a first pass, realizing that it was not the sustainable path forward, went to the drawing board, re-envisioning the way that this system works, and then, fast forward a year and a half, and we're actually seeing the the kind of fruits of those design decisions,” Floersch added.  Some blockchain experts have argued that rollup technology without fault proofs is a security risk, as transactions are unsafe or can be spoofed with.  The deployment of fault proofs on the test network, or “testnet,” is the first step toward implementing it on the OP Stack. OP Labs says the software should also eventually be able to accommodate so-called “zero-knowledge” proofs, relying on a promising cryptographic technology that could be used as an alternative to fault proofs.  Martin Köppelmann, a long-time Ethereum developer and co-founder of the Gnosis blockchain, tweeted in August when Coinbase’s Base went live that until fault proofs are added, “all the ~$3b that are in the Optimism and Base bridges can be taken out any time, and users can do nothing about it.”  Floersch said he’s aware of the criticism but told CoinDesk that he believed that in order to ship fault proofs, blockchain projects first needed to address governance and decentralization.  To reach that stage, known as stage 2 decentralization, Floersch shared that in February, OP Labs mapped out the network’s architecture to decentralize certain elements of the protocol.  “Until there is stage two decentralization, the fault proof is not something that is the primary source of security on your chain,” Floersch told CoinDesk. “If governance can override the fault proof, then the fault proof is useful, but it is not the thing that you're relying on for your primary source of security.”  Read more: Ethereum’s Layer 2 Rollups Reduce Costs, but the Risks Are Underappreciated",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | OP,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/03/at-last-blockchain-developer-op-labs-delivers-fault-proofs-missing-from-core-design,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d440d5f409f528ab5c458211111623d35397c246-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Jury Selection Should Be Quick Grewal noted that the voir dire proceedings have generally improved over time, as in the past, the process could drag on for days. As such, he expects Sam Bankman-Fried’s jury selection to “move quick” as the court while trying to ensure a fair trial, also ensures not to waste the time of prospective jurors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Sparks Speculation As Cryptic Email, X Account Resurfaces The jury selection for SBF’s trial is expected to last just a day (October 3) as, according to the trial calendar, the trial is set to officially commence on October 4, with the prosecution set to open its case on that day. As part of the voir dire proceedings, both parties will question the potential jurors to determine their competency and identify any bias that could influence their decision. However, Grewal doesn’t expect Judge Lewis Kaplan, the judge in charge of Sam Bankman-Fried’s case, to be a mere bystander as he noted that federal judges “exercise a much hand over questioning” than their state counterparts. According to him, these judges don’t just “hand over” the process to the lawyers because they understand that both parties aren’t looking for a fair jury but one that can help them win. It is worth mentioning that Grewal has judicial experience as he was once a US magistrate judge for the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. During his time as a judge, he picked 35 juries, although they were in civil matters, unlike this, which is a criminal one. The Jury And Its Composition Sam Bankman-Fried’s jury is expected to comprise 12 jurors from all walks of life. They will be required to give a verdict on each of the defendant’s charges (SBF is being charged with seven counts of fraud-related charges). This verdict will be unanimous, with all jurors participating in it. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Flip Bitcoin? Crypto Analyst Explains How As regards the jury composition, Grewal noted that it was “critical to a fair outcome.” However, he stated that prosecutors prefer their case to depend on “damning evidence” rather than the juror makeup. A plausible reason could be that certain biases could exist depending on who the jury consists of, unlike damning evidence that can hardly be refuted. The legal expert seems to be one of those foreseeing a conviction, as he added that there was no shortage of “damning evidence in this case” as Sam Bankman-Fried faces a statutory maximum sentence of 110 years if found guilty of all charges.

42419492,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEfU5,1696344827,Decentralized Exchange Bluefin’s New Version Goes Live on Sui Network,"Decentralized orderbook exchange Bluefin’s upgraded version called “v2” went live on the Sui network, the company Tuesday said in a press release.  The platform’s new iteration adds features such as sub-second, optimistic trades, spot and cross-margin capabilities and a privacy function to trade without a crypto wallet.  The first version of the platform – Bluefin v1, which lets users trade perpetual swaps on Ethereum scaling network Arbitrum – will remain active, the company said.  “Over the course of this year, we’ve rewritten our codebase and rebuilt the exchange on a new underlying technology,” Bluefin said in the press release. “With the next version of the exchange, we want to build a decentralized platform that can match the features and trading experience of centralized exchanges.”  Bluefin’s development comes at a time when crypto trading volumes have dropped significantly as the grueling bear market drags on. DEX volumes averaged at around $10 billion per week recently compared to topping over $60 billion last November, according to DefiLlama data.  Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) came to the forefront last year after a handful of centralized platforms including Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX blew up in a spectacular fashion. Still, most of the trading volume is still concentrated on centralized platforms due to usually cheaper transactions and speedier execution.  Bluefin’s v2 claims to improve the speed with so-called “optimistic trade confirmations,” settling the trade on the platform’s user interface in advance before finalizing it on the blockchain The platform’s redesigned off-chain orderbook layer can start sending optimistic confirmations of trades in around 30 milliseconds back to users, then ensuring the trade with the on-chain smart contracts in around 480 milliseconds, the press release explained.  “With Sui’s parallel execution, the availability of the network is not constrained by other applications and users. As a result, the success rate of transactions submitted on-chain is extremely high,” the press release said.  Bluefin raised funds from investors such as Polychain Capital and large trading firms like Susquehanna, Wintermute, GSR and Wintermute, according to the platform’s website.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TRADING | ARB,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/03/decentralized-exchange-bluefins-new-version-goes-live-on-sui-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6add8af379f6ab2e1a5c4ba533e1259c4de02bb5-1035x582.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419496,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEfbJ,1696341684,First Mover Americas: Slow Start for Ether Futures ETFs,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  It was a slow start for futures-based ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on their first day of trading. A total of nine of the ETFs offering exposure to ether futures came to market on Monday. Five will hold only ether futures, while four will hold a mix of bitcoin and ether futures. One of those funds, Valkyrie’s Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) – soon to be renamed – has been in existence for about two years as a bitcoin-only fund, but is changing its strategy to include ether. The rest of the vehicles are new to market. “Pretty meh volume for the Ether Futures ETFs as a group,” said Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Among the more popular of the new ETFs today, VanEck’s Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) traded just shy of 25,000 shares at a price roughly averaging $17 per share on Monday for a total dollar volume of just $425,000. For comparison, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) – which launched in October 2021 amid a raging crypto bull market – reported trading volume of more than $1 billion on its first day.  Grayscale Investments in conjunction with NYSE Arca has filed for approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) to a spot ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). Grayscale’s Ethereum trust is the largest ether investment product in the world, with almost $5 billion in assets under management. “At Grayscale, our unwavering commitment is to offer investors transparent and regulated access to crypto through product structures that are familiar,” said Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein in a statement. “As we file to convert ETHE to an ETF, the natural next step in the product’s evolution, we recognize this as an important moment to bring Ethereum even further into the U.S. regulatory perimeter.”  Former crypto boss Sam Bankman-Fried wants to stop the government from calling multiple witnesses, including company investors and a Ukrainian customer left bereft by the collapse of his FTX exchange, according to court filings made just hours before his trial is due to begin. Bankman-Fried, who has pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of fraud after FTX filed for bankruptcy in November, doesn’t want former company insiders testifying about the meaning of supposedly “coded” expressions used as part of an alleged conspiracy to misuse customer funds. While prosecutors at the U.S. Department of Justice want former customers and investors to testify about how they understood FTX would safeguard their assets, Bankman-Fried’s lawyer Mark Cohen said in a filing made public Tuesday that the request was “premature,” and would prompt members of the jury to conclusions they should draw for themselves.

18330707,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553910,1696341600,Bitcoin News: Revival Of “Satoshi Nakamoto” Account Could Signal Slump In BTC Price?,"In recent Bitcoin news, the creator of the cryptocurrency, Satoshi Nakamoto, has been back in the spotlight. A recent email and the resurgence of an X account allegedly associated with Nakamoto attracted the crypto community’s attention, an event that could impact BTC’s price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Sees Technical Correction But The Bulls Are Not Done Yet As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $27,600 after hitting a 24-hour high of $28,500 and losing momentum. The cryptocurrency rallied back to these highs, but a spike in selling pressure killed the upside price action in the short term. Bitcoin News Around Satoshi Nakamoto To Impact BTC Price? Two Bitcoin news associated with Satoshi Nakamoto, the re-emergence of the satoshi handle on social media X, and an email sent to computer scientist Wei Dai have been making the rounds. Only two of these events are genuinely linked to the Bitcoin inventor: the email where Nakamoto expresses admiration for Dai. One of the few living scientists referenced in the Bitcoin Whitepaper, Dai’s contribution to the invention of digital currencies with the creation of b-money. This page, along with Adam Back’s Hashcash, was one of the precedents for what later became the Bitcoin network. The crypto community has celebrated the emergence of this historical document. As for the other event, the re-activation of the satoshi handle has attracted negative attention. The account has been linked to potential fraudulent activity, turned into a meme, and even linked to suspicious individuals within the crypto space. One analyst even linked the account to a bearish event for the BTC price action. In 2018, at the top of the Bitcoin bull run that took the cryptocurrency from its all-time high of $20,000 to fresh lows, the satoshi handle posted a link allegedly pointing to the Bitcoin Whitepaper. After that, the cryptocurrency’s price crashed to $3,100, as seen in the image below. Bitcoin Price Analysis, Bearish Momentum To Extend? The Bitcoin price action and the re-emergence of this X account seem unrelated and more likely classified into the series of memes coming out of the event. However, the price of the cryptocurrency shows signs of further losses. Related Reading: Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Sparks Speculation As Cryptic Email, X Account Resurfaces As NewsBTC reported yesterday, based on data from QCP Capital, the recent rally was driven by seasonality and the approval of an Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. The second of these events has been proven to operate as a bearish catalyzer for the crypto market. The trading firm said: We would even go further to say a futures-only ETF is arguably detrimental to spot price – as it potentially directs demand away from the spot market into a synthetic market.

The wholesale plans appear to be moving faster than a much more controversial plan for a digital euro to be used by ordinary citizens, where lawmakers have raised numerous concerns over privacy and the impact on commercial banks.  “The Eurosystem has started exploring new technologies for the settlement of central bank money, including the issuance of a first type of tokenized CBDC,” François Villeroy de Galhau said at an event in Paris. “The eligibility criteria and the call of interest will be published in the coming weeks and experiments will be rolled out over the course of next year, including trials with real transactions.”  A permissioned network that works with smart contracts would allow central banks to continue to govern the supply of money to the economy, something central bankers regard as central to their task of managing inflation and financial stability, Villeroy de Galhau said.  The central bank would be exploring “alternative protocols and blockchains” as well as its own proprietary Distributed Ledger for Securities Settlement System, DL3S, he added.  A recent study by traditional finance lobbyists suggested that financial markets powered by distributed ledger technology could save $100 billion per year by freeing collateral and automating back-office processes.  Wholesale CBDC plans were already floated at a series of industry meetings convened by the European Central Bank earlier this year – and appear to be progressing faster than the retail idea, where lawmakers are currently wrestling with legislation that has raised significant political opposition.  In a recent letter seen by CoinDesk, a group of cross-party EU lawmakers asked the ECB to postpone any decisions on a retail CBDC until they can agree on new legal constraints.  Signatories to the letter, sent Sept. 26, include the Netherlands’ Michiel Hoogeveen, former Belgian Finance Minister Johan van Overtveldt and Markus Ferber, economic spokesperson for the EU’s largest, center-right political grouping, the European People's Party.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | WALLET,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/03/eu-plans-for-wholesale-cbdc-out-within-weeks-french-central-banker-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8dbd99fa9a289b92ec3fd615abcefed67ad107a4-791x445.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419495,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEfaH,1696339800,There's a Lot of Thefts Happening,"There's been a lot of hacks or other types of theft in the crypto industry recently, which seems likely to continue harming the industry’s reputation (not to mention all the victims losing their money).  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Hacks and thefts and exploits, oh my  The narrative  Some $212.5 million in crypto-related funds were hacked or stolen over the past few weeks, the vast majority from a single platform.  Why it matters  It’s hard to imagine regulators being super jazzed about the ongoing plethora of hacks and other thefts. It is a bit harder to imagine how the industry can try and rectify this situation.  Breaking it down  Want to know something wild? A few hours past midnight last Saturday, my colleague Shaurya and I saw that around $4 million worth of ether – 2,500 ETH – had moved out of a wallet associated with last year's account draining exploit of FTX, which happened a mere few hours after the exchange filed for bankruptcy.  By the end of the weekend, more than $26 million (15,000 ETH) in funds had been moved, mostly into tools and services that will make it more difficult, if not impossible, to track them moving forward. This comes a few days or weeks after a number of crypto platforms, like HTX (formerly Huobi), Mixin and Fortress, all announced they lost funds due to hacks.  Hacks of centralized and decentralized platforms is nothing new. But the fact that they’re continuing to proliferate in these extremely highly-public ways can do nothing but hurt the overall crypto industry’s reputation at a time when, to be quite frank, it already isn’t great.  Maybe one lesson from the last few weeks is that people in crypto – investors and users, yes, but especially builders and funders – need to rethink their attack vectors. For an industry built on ""not your keys,"" there is an awful lot of reliance on third-party tools and providers, any one of which could be compromised.  Recall that CoinDesk revealed it was one such provider that ultimately led to last month's $15 million Fortress theft.  Mixin hasn't, as of earlier this week, revealed who the database provider is. What we do know is there's an increasing number of service providers of all stripes being attacked. There's multi-factor authentication providers, cloud tool providers, Slack and so on.  Attackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated. We know this too after Google, Apple and Microsoft have all announced patching zero day bugs (referring to vulnerabilities that can be exploited immediately) in recent weeks.  Bringing this back to regulators, we know that lawmakers in the U.S. at least are looking at bills to try and enforce more know-your-customer rules on the crypto industry. While it’s unclear whether any of the bills may have genuine legs at this point – Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) threw cold water on an effort by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) just yesterday, for example – these efforts are ongoing.  However regulators ultimately choose to react, it does seem incumbent on industry participants to find ways of mitigating these issues first.

Sam Bankman-Fried goes to trial  FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial begins today. You may recall that CoinDesk has a daily newsletter covering the estimated six-week judicial proceedings. Here’s an excerpt from today’s issue, penned by Danny Nelson. Sign up here if you want updates every morning.  We may not know for weeks whether Sam Bankman-Fried will take the stand at his own trial. He may want the chance to explain himself to the jury, but his lawyers are surely wary of the withering cross-examination such a tactic would invite. No matter: the unconventional former crypto executive has already said – publicly – plenty about what went down in FTX’s final days.  What follows are a series of excerpts from interviews that SBF gave in the month between FTX’s collapse and his arrest in the Bahamas. They provide a picture into the mind of the man prosecutors allege was behind one of the greatest financial frauds in history. According to the man himself, he was a well-meaning altruist whose heady risk-taking got him in over his head.  In early December, a Wall Street Journal interviewer pressed SBF on his knowledge of operations at Alameda, the crypto hedge fund accused of borrowing billions of dollars in crypto from FTX and its unknowing customers. According to SBF, who had a 90% ownership stake in Alameda and lived with its CEO, Caroline Ellison, he, too, didn’t fully know what was going on there, a refrain he later echoed in documents shared with the New York Times.  “FTX was a full-time job,” he told the Journal. “It was more than a full-time job. And I didn't have enough brain cycles left to understand everything going on at Alameda if I wanted to. I also didn't want to because I was concerned about conflicts of interest. And I felt like it would be inappropriate for me to be looped into, certainly to details of what was going on there.”  Prosecutors are almost certainly keen on demonstrating the opposite to the jury.

In a recent interview, Gromen posits that these assets could flourish as the fiscal challenges in the United States continue to mount. Gromen’s argument hinges on the idea that both gold and Bitcoin are “duration assets” with fixed supplies and the potential for their face values to rise. In times of fiscal distress, these assets tend to shine. Related Reading: Crypto Era Looms: BIS Innovations Chief Calls On Central Banks To Prepare As the US grapples with fiscal issues exacerbated by relentless quantitative easing and potential shifts in Federal Reserve policies, Gromen believes that this environment will create a fertile ground for gold, oil, and Bitcoin. “[Gold and BTC will do well] because they are simply duration assets with a more fixed supply and a face value that can rise,” he stated. “They do well when a nation has a fiscal problem, and when the reserve currency issue of the world and her allies all have fiscal problems, and hers is at least as bad or probably worse than the others – even Europe – then it’s really good for gold and Bitcoin.” BRICS And The Dollar’s Reshaping Gromen also delved into the potential ramifications of the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) launching a gold-backed currency. Such a move could undermine the US dollar’s longstanding position as the world’s reserve currency. The prospect of a gold-backed currency gaining traction among these major economies could weaken the dollar’s dominance in international trade and finance. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency sector is experiencing a bullish surge, with Bitcoin leading the charge. It has surpassed the critical psychological threshold of $28,000, sparking optimism among investors. Notably, Cryptoinsightuk, a pseudonymous crypto trading analyst, has conducted a revealing analysis of Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) indicator. Bitcoin moving halfway to the $28K region. Chart: TradingView.com Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum Cryptoinsightuk’s analysis tracks the instances when Bitcoin’s weekly RSI crossed above the 50 mark (green) and then dropped below this level (red). The expert found that, on average, these events led to a remarkable 1,100% price increase for Bitcoin. Such a surge could become a reality in the right circumstances, including a supply squeeze and the introduction of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

Fabiano will be starting a new advisory firm - Fabiano Consulting - to help bitcoin miners grow their business, according to a statement to CoinDesk.  “I've discovered I really enjoy working with companies in their growth stages and love building,"" she said in the statement. ""I'm eager to utilize the knowledge and background I've gained and assist others in their growth endeavors.”  Fabiano said she will be working with Compass Mining and Giga Energy, among others, as inaugural clients of the consulting business.  She spent three years at Galaxy building up the firm’s mining business, offering operational and capital markets products. Previously she was director of bitcoin mining at Fidelity Investments  One of the most significant undertakings under Fabiano was the acquisition of Helios mining facility from the miner Argo Blockchain (ARBK) last year. The deal – worth nearly $100 million – brought the miner back from the verge of bankruptcy and provided Galaxy with an operation with a mining capacity of 180 megawatts.  The prolonged crypto winter weighed heavily on the mining industry, which crushed miners' profits and led to high-profile bankruptcies. Now, with Bitcoin network’s hashrate near an all-time high and the halving coming next year, miners need prudent strategies to grow their operations more than ever, according to Fabiano.  “As we witness a continuous rise in hash rate, it becomes imperative for companies to ponder the pivotal question: How can I position myself for success in the present market conditions and the post-halving future?” Fabiano noted.

18327773,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553890,1696334436,Crypto Watchlist For October: Altcoins To Keep On Your Radar,"As the dynamic crypto landscape evolves, attention is turning not only to the giants but increasingly to emerging altcoins that show promise and innovation. October is shaping up to be a pivotal month for a select group of these altcoins, with potential frontrunners positioning themselves. Here are our top 4 altcoins for October. Arbitrum (ARB) Arbitrum (ARB) is thrust into the limelight as it inaugurates its Short Term Incentive Program (STIP), positioning 50 million ARB to be siphoned into protocols residing within its ecosystem. The maneuver is predictive of a substantial acceleration in liquidity, reminiscent of Optimism’s grant’s influential impact which witnessed the Total Value Locked (TVL) catapulting from $300 million to $1 billion during its grant distribution period, as highlighted by DeFi researcher Thor Hartvigsen. In total, over 105 applications have already been funneled into the Arbitrum STIP, predominantly from DeFi applications, and notably DEXes which are commandeering the dominant category followed by yield aggregators and lending markets. Related Reading: Is Your Crypto at Risk? FBI Issues Dire Warning Over ‘Phantom Hacker’ At press time, ARB was trading at $0.9295 after the price was rejected at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level ($0.9721). A break above this resistance is crucial. In particular, it is important for ARB not to fall below the descending trendline (black) again, which was breached on Sunday. Solana (SOL) Hartvigsen emphasized the potential he sees in SOL, noting, “Growing DeFi ecosystem and a very strong/vocal community. Solana has established itself as more than just another L1 as it has significant scaling benefits with product market fit.” This assertion further manifests with projects like Eclipse undertaking ambitious endeavors, specifically, “building an Ethereum L2 with the Solana VM.” Such innovations not only underscore Solana’s rising importance but also demonstrate its practicality and adaptability in the continuously evolving DeFi landscape. In the last 22 days, the SOL price has increased by almost 40%, and the sentiment around Solana is extremely positive. As the latest CoinShares weekly report shows, SOL has been one of the most popular investments among digital asset funds around the world in recent weeks. The Solana (SOL) price broke above the 200-day EMA on Sunday and also managed to cross the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. Assuming a successful retest, the SOL price could target the $26.63 and $32.35 levels. Radiant Capital (RDNT) Radiant Capital’s momentum in the crypto sphere took an intentional pause with the deferral of its Ethereum mainnet deployment from October 3rd to the 15th. Addressing this decision, Radiant Capital cited their unwavering commitment to quality, remarking: “During the final stages of testing for Ethereum mainnet deployment, we’ve identified opportunities for significant gas optimizations. It’s imperative to ensure competitive gas costs to deliver an optimal user experience.” Related Reading: Crypto Fund Flows: Bitcoin Leads As Solana Follows, But Why’s Ethereum Left Behind? Beyond the temporary shift in launch timelines, the organization’s team remains palpable. Thor Hartvigsen reflected on Radiant Capital’s prowess, stating, “RDNT – Already leading the lending/borrowing market on Arbitrum. Expecting TVL to rise from the cross chain expansion. Expecting TVL to rise from the cross chain expansion. Further: Arbitrum STIP proposal to receive 3.36 million ARB aimed at ecosystem growth.” RDNT saw a strong drawdown of close to 62% after the all-time high at $0.4956 on April 15. However, after the historical low at $0.1905, RDNT has already shown a strong reaction. Should the price break above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.2625, it could be interpreted as an indication of a breakout from the downtrend. Maker (MKR) Maker (MKR) has been generating significant attention in the crypto community, primarily due to its impressive rally in recent weeks. Central to Maker’s rise is its strong financial performance. Hartvigsen illuminates this by noting: “Maker is the largest revenue-generating protocol in DeFi with a current annualized revenue of $193m!” This revenue is primarily driven by interest accrued from DAI minters, with a significant proportion coming from Real World Assets (RWAs). As he further elaborates, “Currently, 53% of all DAI collateral comes from RWAs such as US t-bills paying out nearly 5% APY. Roughly 63% of the $193m in annualized revenue comes from the RWA collateral.” But what has precipitated this uptick in MKR’s valuation? Hartvigsen attributes it to two primary factors: “1) More of the collateral as RWA (and high US interest rates) and 2) A growing DAI supply.” He emphasizes the symbiotic relationship between Maker’s revenue and DAI’s market cap, stating that “Maker revenue depends primarily on the total market cap of DAI as the collateral backing this stablecoin is what generates fees.” On the horizon, MKR’s prospects appear even more promising. Hartvigsen lists several catalysts that could further propel its growth. One notable highlight is the potential impact of DAI’s ongoing expansion: “If the DAI supply can continue to grow, the Maker revenue will continue to grow which most likely will impact the price positively.” Additionally, forthcoming developments, including “a MKR 1:12000 token split,” a complete rebranding initiative, and the anticipated launch of subDAOs, are set to infuse MKR with enhanced utility and potentially greater demand in the market. As he concludes, these changes will enable “MKR holders to stake MKR to farm these new subDAO tokens which will create additional token utility.” After the MKR price crossed the 200-day EMA at 1,110 three weeks ago, the odds are good that the rally will continue. A possible target could be the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,888.

42419481,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEfKn,1696333289,"Friend.Tech Users Targeted by SIM Swap Attack, Several Ether Drained","Some Friend.Tech users reported that they were the victim of SIM swap attacks over the weekend with the attackers successfully draining thousands of dollars worth of tokens.  The Friend.Tech code itself was not exploited. No users are at immediate risk. The application lets holders buy ""shares"" of people who hold an account on X which grants buyers certain privileges.  SIM Swap attacks are a common occurrence and happen when criminals take over control of a mobile phone by tricking service providers to connect that phone number to a SIM card in the hacker’s possession. Swapped phones can then be used for fraudulent activity.  At least two users claimed that were targeted in a SIM swap attack which allowed exploiters to drain over 42 ether (ETH), worth nearly $70,000 at current prices, over separate attacks.  “If your Twitter account is doxxed to your real name, your phone number can be found, and this could happen to you,” posted @darengb, a user who got impacted. Their phone carrier is Verizon.  Social application Friend.Tech has become one of the most popular crypto platforms this year, despite the bear market, generating steady revenues and profits for its creators. The application amassed over 100,000 users in under two weeks after going live, as previously reported.  However, security risks remain a large cause of concern for any crypto platform. Hackers may employ techniques from smart contract manipulation or flash loan attacks, to using a traditional method to exploit wealthy users.  Some Friend.Tech users have suggested added security features, such as 2FA, a common SMS or code-based authentication service, that may prevent a repeat of such attacks in the future.  ""The SIM swap attack on FriendTech users is a great reminder of the importance of strong security measures, especially for accounts containing valuable digital assets,"" said Eran Karpen, Co-Founder and CTO at Unplugged, in a message to CoinDesk. ""SMS, a technology developed in the 1980s, is relatively simple and vulnerable to attack. In the FriendTech case, the cell carriers were the attack vectors and were tricked into redirecting your phone number to a SIM card they controlled. Two-factor authentication (2FA) with an authenticator app, rather than SMS, authenticates on the device, not the cell carrier, and can mitigate the attack.""  ""An alternative solution will be to use a secondary ""secret"" SIM for 2FA via a phone that supports dual SIM or e-SIM. That way, you refrain from using your main SIM attached to your publicly known phone number,"" Karpen added.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/03/friendtech-users-targeted-by-sim-swap-attack-several-ether-drained,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9e73df1d60d9ad5ed83a9f2f0e63b31443808d7-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The debate has become more fueled by an old email and a tweet that suggests that the ‘real’ Nakamoto is still far from being identified. Bitcoin Creator Correspondence With Wei Dei An email correspondence between Satoshi Nakamoto and B-money founder Wei Dei has resurfaced. In the email (dated August 22, 2008), Nakamoto mentioned his interest in Dei’s B-money and noted the similarities between B-money and Bitcoin as he planned to release a paper that would expand Dei’s ideas into a “complete working system.” Related Reading: Will Ethereum Flip Bitcoin? Crypto Analyst Explains How Indeed, one could rightly point out that B-money and Satoshi’s Bitcoin share similarities, as the former was proposed by Dei in 1998 to be an “anonymous, distributed electronic cash system.” Interestingly, to make this work, Dei had proposed a proof-of-work protocol to make his B-money idea a reality and Bitcoin happens to run on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. In the email, Nakamoto told Dei that Adam Back (who happens to have pioneered the proof-of-work system) was the one who drew his attention to the similarities between B-money and Bitcoin. The email has again led many to speculate whether or not Dei and Back may be letting more than they know, considering that they were one of the first persons Nakamoto reached out to concerning Bitcoin. However, Back has mentioned in the past that he doesn’t know Nakamoto personally as the Bitcoin creator only reached out to him in an email (just the same way he reached out to Dei). BTC returns to mid-$27,000s | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Alleged Satoshi Nakamoto X Account Surfaces Meanwhile, a tweet from Nakomoto’s alleged X account surfaced on October 2 (the same day Ager-Hanssen revealed the email between Ayre and Wright). In the tweet, the handler revealed that different aspects not explicitly contained within Bitcoin’s whitepaper would be explored in the following months. This tweet likely refers to the fact that Bitcoin has long been considered as only a store of value and wasn’t meant for other uses like Decentralized Finance (DeFi) or to host NFTs (non-fungible tokens). Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer Reveals The Impact Of SEC’s Lawsuit Against Ripple While such news will usually be bullish for the Bitcoin ecosystem, many were more concerned if these tweets were indeed from the real Satoshi Nakamoto. Community notes also highlighted that the account was controlled by Craig Wright, who has been “proven to be a fraud” and should not be trusted. Specifically, an influencer in the XRP community, Edward Farina, noted that the account was verified, meaning the handler had likely gone through a KYC verification. Therefore, it is “clearly” not the real Satoshi but someone looking for “X payout,” he stated.

42419482,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEfLp,1696327200,"The Collapse of FTX, in Sam’s Own Words","We may not know for weeks whether Sam Bankman-Fried will take the stand at his own trial. He may want the chance to explain himself to the jury, but his lawyers are surely wary of the withering cross-examination such a tactic would invite. No matter: the unconventional former crypto executive has already said – publicly – plenty about what went down in FTX’s final days.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  What follows are a series of excerpts from interviews that SBF gave in the month between FTX’s collapse and his arrest in the Bahamas. They provide a picture of the mind of the man prosecutors allege was behind one of the greatest financial frauds in history. According to the man himself, he was a well-meaning altruist whose heady risk-taking got him in over his head.  In early December, a Wall Street Journal interviewer pressed SBF on his knowledge of operations at Alameda, the crypto hedge fund accused of borrowing billions of dollars in crypto from FTX and its unknowing customers. According to SBF, who had a 90% ownership stake in Alameda and lived with its CEO, Caroline Ellison, he, too, didn’t fully know what was going on there, a refrain he later echoed in documents shared with the New York Times.  “FTX was a full-time job,” he told the Journal. “It was more than a full-time job. And I didn't have enough brain cycles left to understand everything going on at Alameda if I wanted to. I also didn't want to because I was concerned about conflicts of interest. And I felt like it would be inappropriate for me to be looped into, certainly to details of what was going on there.”  Prosecutors are almost certainly keen on demonstrating the opposite to the jury. Here, testimony from Ellison herself may prove critical in showcasing what SBF knew, and when.  One thing he did seem to know (or at least, claimed) was that FTX’s U.S. operations did not go kaput when its sister exchange, International, fell into the black hole of those Alameda loans.  “I believe that withdrawals could be opened up today, and everyone could be made whole from that and none of these problems plague the U.S. platform,” SBF told Andrew Ross Sorkin in the New York Times’ headline-grabbing first interview with the felled CEO. Despite SBF’s insistence, U.S. customers still haven’t gotten their money back. Look out for prosecutors to explain why – this argument is the source of at least one ongoing procedural dispute between the defense and DOJ.  Part of his identity has always hinged on the idea of amassing great wealth in order to give it all away. SBF’s “effective altruism” was a philosophical tilt and also an ad tagline for crypto’s white knight. Was it real? A Vox interviewer asked SBF over Twitter DMs if “the ethics stuff” was “mostly a front.”  “Yeah. I mean that’s not all of it. But it's a lot,” he said. Later on in the screenshotted conversation SBF said “I feel bad” for those who don’t say the right things and therefore lose “this dumb game we woke westerners play where we say all the right shibboleths and so everyone likes us.”  SBF’s apology tour was set to culminate with him providing congressional testimony in mid-December – an unheard-of gamble for a felled financial executive dogged by scandal. His plan derailed when Bahamian authorities took him into custody on Dec. 13, 2022. But a leaked notepad of what appears to be his roadmap for remarks includes a strange characterization of FTX’s internal controls.  According to SBF, he and others inside the FTX empire lost track of Alameda’s massive loans “because of a historical accounting quirk” that mucked up all-important dashboards, and that this oops-level oversight led the hole ballooning much bigger than he realized.  “Historical accounting quirk” is a hell of a way to describe the hardcoded $65 billion ceiling that Alameda could borrow from FTX. In filings prosecutors have alleged the hedge fund had access to an infinite money glitch bigger even than FTX’s total deposits. And we’ll hear more about this soon because…  Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial begins today. He faces two counts of wire fraud and five counts of conspiracy to commit wire, securities and commodities fraud. Watch CoinDesk.com for updates as they happen, and stay tuned for this newsletter to catch up in a single pocket. For those of you planning to attend in person, here are the logistics details:  Who: U.S. prosecutors, Sam Bankman-Fried, and his defense attorneys  What: U.S.A. v. Samuel Bankman-Fried  When: 9:30 a.m. EDT  Where: The Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse in lower Manhattan (500 Pearl St., for those of you who want something you can plug into your GPS).  What we're expecting  Though today is the first day of trial, we won’t hear too much – opening arguments won’t begin until at least tomorrow. Instead, today’s the voir dire process. We should get final confirmation from Judge Lewis Kaplan about whether he intends to use any of the proposed questions from the Department of Justice and defense.  We may also get an updated witness list, depending on if that’s shared publicly as an exhibit. A past court filing did suggest it may come up during voir dire, in terms of checking whether any of the potential jurors know the witnesses.

Token prices jumped as much as 8% before retreating to extend weekly gains to nearly 40%, data shows.  When burned, tokens are permanently removed from supply by being sent to an address that is not controlled by anyone.  “Nearly $38,000,000 was generated across our three revenue streams, resulting in a buy and burn of over $5,000,000 in RLB (1.265% of the circulating supply),” co-founder @Lucky_Rollbit said in an X post.  Such volumes seemingly correspond to just under 20,000 token holders, platform data shows. In the past 24 hours, the platform has clocked $851,000 in casino revenues, $338,000 in futures revenue and $141,000 in sports betting.  Rollbit allows users to trade tokens using 1000x leverage and offers sports betting and arcade games, as well as a tokenized jackpot.

His lawyers are querying the government’s right to call witnesses including a Ukrainian investor and former FTX executives.  Former crypto boss Sam Bankman-Fried wants to stop the government from calling multiple witnesses, including company investors and a Ukrainian customer left bereft by the collapse of his FTX exchange, according to court filings made just hours before his trial is due to begin.  Bankman-Fried, who has pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of fraud after FTX filed for bankruptcy in November, doesn’t want former company insiders testifying about the meaning of supposedly “coded” expressions used as part of an alleged conspiracy to misuse customer funds.  While prosecutors at the U.S. Department of Justice want former customers and investors to testify about how they understood FTX would safeguard their assets, Bankman-Fried’s lawyer Mark Cohen said in a filing made public Tuesday that the request was “premature,” and would prompt members of the jury to conclusions they should draw for themselves.  The DOJ “asks the Court to permit percipient witnesses to offer their own opinions and interpretations on issues that the jury must evaluate from the objective perspective of a reasonable person,” a move for which there’s no legal basis, Cohen said, adding that the defense should at least be able to cross-question any government witnesses.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried’s Closest Friends Will Testify Against Him. Here’s Who Else We’ll Hear From  A proposed Ukrainian FTX customer who the government says lost a substantial portion of his life savings on the exchange, and who cannot leave the country, should not be allowed to testify remotely, and had been picked only to generate the jury’s “sympathy and outrage” linked to the war, Cohen said in an earlier, Monday night filing.  Cohen also accused the government of “gamesmanship” for seeking to call expert investors after Judge Lewis Kaplan blocked Bankman-Fried’s own proposed witnesses, and said that the meaning of Bankman-Fried’s words doesn’t need to be explained to the jury by the former FTX insiders who are cooperating with prosecutors.  While the DOJ does not name the alleged co-conspirators it wants to call to offer those explanations, it's likely to refer to colleagues and friends such as Caroline Ellison, Bankman-Fried’s former romantic partner and ex-head of FTX’s hedge fund arm Alameda Research.

The entire cryptocurrency market has been on a bullish streak, with most digital assets turning green on the charts. However, Solana has managed to stand out by achieving an unprecedented increase in its price. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $23.54 on CoinGecko and boasted a market capitalization near $10 billion. While the coin did register a 1.6% loss in the past 24 hours, its seven-day surge of 22% indicated its resilience and potential for further growth. In fact, this remarkable price uptrend enabled Solana to surpass both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA), securing its position as the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

Additionally, Solana’s performance within the decentralized finance sector also experienced notable growth during this period. The positive sentiment surrounding Solana was further evidenced by data from LunarCrush, which indicated a nearly 47% surge in SOL’s social engagement over the last seven days. Investors and enthusiasts were increasingly drawn to the coin as its price continued to rise. Source: LunarCrush Gearing Up For A Bull Market Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal, active on the social media platform X, expressed optimism about Solana’s potential. Inmortal believes that Solana presents a significant opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate the cryptocurrency at a point of maximum potential. In two years you will realize that everything was as simple as buying $SOL below $20 and wait. But you were too scared because FTX was going to dump their coins. — Inmortal (@inmortalcrypto) September 20, 2023 According to Inmortal, those who accumulate SOL at its current price point are likely to be handsomely rewarded in the coming years. In a statement, Inmortal said, “In two years, you will realize that everything was as simple as buying SOL below $20 and waiting. But you were too scared because FTX was going to dump their coins.” SOL market cap approaches the $10 billion level. Chart: TradingView.com Concerns had arisen when court documents revealed that FTX owns approximately $1.16 billion worth of SOL. This led many traders to speculate that Solana’s price might face downward pressure if FTX were to liquidate its holdings. However, notable investor Chris Burniske pointed out that only a fraction of FTX’s SOL holdings are actually liquid, stating, “Only ~13% of FTX’s SOL holdings are liquid… Keep a cool head, folks.” Related Reading: Solana Rebound Potential: Is $30 The Next Target?

42419493,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEfYD,1696323587,Bitcoin Buckles to $27.4K as Crypto Rally Fizzles on Macro Jitters,"Bitcoin (BTC) slid to around $27,400, giving up most of its gains from a short-lived rally above $28,000 at the start of the week as traders took profits as jitters in traditional financial markets weighed on cryptocurrency prices.  BTC sunk to as low as $27,275 during U.S. morning hours on Tuesday, down 3.5% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based weighted index of hundreds of tokens, fell 3.4%, indicating profit-taking across the board.  The decline happened as continued rising bond market yields took a toll on risk assets across the board. The 10-year U.S. Treasury rate surged 8 bps to 4.76%, a fresh 16-year high early Tuesday, helping to send the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 lower 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively.  ""The crypto hangover could be enduring as global rates continue to rise, despite recession signals,"" Mike McGlone, senior macro strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, said Tuesday in an X (formerly Twitter) post. He noted in a report that the U.S. Federal Reserve is still on the path of tightening liquidity conditions, and a declining BTC price has typically preceded Fed pivots. ""Bitcoin may need to fall first,"" he concluded.  Ether (ETH) dropped near 4% to $1,649, fully retracing its advance above the $1,700 level after a dismal first day trading of ETH futures exchange-traded funds in the U.S.  XRP, BNB Chain’s BNB and dogecoin (DOGE) slumped 2%-3% during the day. Tron network’s TRX was down 4% at one point during Asian morning hours, then stabilized at around 8.7 cents.  Rollbit’s RLB tokens jumped 8%, continuing a multi-day run amid increased token demand and platform revenues.  Crypto optimism fizzles  Crypto markets rose Monday on ETF optimism that some traders hoped would bring renewed interest and capital to an otherwise tepid environment. Some even pointed to the historic seasonality of price surges in the month of October, aiming for a repeat of the unexplained coincidence.  But such an outlook always has the chance of falling flat, some argue.  “October is also typically a good month for the cryptocurrency market. Indeed, it is dubbed “uptober” by market insiders,” shared Lucas Kiely, chief investment officer of Yield App, in a message to CoinDesk. “Only twice since 2013 has bitcoin closed at a loss in October, and hopefully, this year will see a continuation of that trend.”  However, it is likely a little too early to get excited by these current price movements. This is unlikely to be the beginning of a significant rally without any other catalysts to drive it,” Keily cautioned, adding that the ongoing Sam Bankman-Fried trial “could take things either way” based on possible new information about crypto markets.  Elsewhere, Bitfinex markets analysts said in a weekly note that long-term investors were continuing to add to their holdings – boosting demand.  “On-chain activity for Bitcoin has hit record highs in terms of new addresses, but what stands out is that this activity predominantly involves short-term holder supply,” the analysts said. “This allows the supply held by long-term holders to continue reaching new peaks as short-term holders sell.”  “Volatility might also soon make a comeback in crypto, potentially towards the upside,” they opined.

18321290,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553861,1696318783,Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price To Hit $0.66 This Week,"Renowned crypto analyst “Dark Defender” has forecasted a short-term bullish movement for the XRP price, with expectations that the cryptocurrency might hit the $0.66 mark this week. Sharing his insights on Twitter, the analyst referenced XRP’s 1-day chart, highlighting recent price dynamics and key technical indicators. “Hi there. XRP in the daily chart broke the initial resistance & back-tested it. We had a similar move on 13-Jul-23. The next Fibonacci level stands at exactly $0.6649. If we don’t see XRP below $0.50 support, we expect to hit $0.66 this week,” the analyst tweeted. A Deep Dive Into The XRP Price Analysis The chart presented by Dark Defender shows that on September 29, XRP experienced an upward breakout from an ascending triangle. The XRP price increase by 8% was driven by market participants’ expectations of Ripple’s Proper Party. Although “major news” failed to materialize, the price of XRP still managed to stay above the trend line. Related Reading: Expert Predicts Staggering 760% Surge For XRP Price: Here’s The Roadmap Historically, ascending triangles are considered continuation or consolidation formations, indicating a potential resumption of the previous trend following a brief period of consolidation. Given XRP’s upward trajectory since January, this breakout suggests the possible continuation of its bullish trend. As Dark Defender highlights, the cryptocurrency underwent a back-test over the subsequent three days, a process the crypto asset has so far confirmed. If the asset sustains above the $0.50 mark, it would successfully clear the back-test as per Dark Defender’s analysis. Drawing a parallel to the past, Dark Defender pointed out a similar price behavior on July 13. That day marked the release of the summary judgment in the lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Amid this backdrop, XRP broke out of its consolidation phase, triggering an almost 100% price rally. Remarkably, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) entered a cooling phase after a brief surge to 74 in late May. The eventual upside break of this descending trend in RSI coincided with XRP’s significant rally. Related Reading: XRP Price Bloodbath On The Horizon? Report Casts Doubt On Recent Rally Observing the recent chart behavior, Dark Defender noted that the RSI’s extended trendline was once again broken upwards last Friday. Although there wasn’t a significant news catalyst from Ripple to push XRP’s price dramatically, an RSI trendline back-test occurred in recent days. If this is confirmed, it could signal a surge toward the “next” Fibonacci level at $0.66 as mentioned by the analyst. Long-Term Price Targets Dark Defender, in a tweet from October 1, expressed optimism about the XRP price trajectory, specifically highlighting its recent close with a doji candle pattern in September. He remarked, “XRP closed the September candle with a doji. I take this positive, as always, and expect a re-test towards $0.66 in a couple of days.” Expanding on this observation, Dark Defender suggests that if XRP breaks the $0.55 threshold, it will gain significant momentum. This is due to the asset potentially positioning itself above the weekly Ichimoku Clouds, a scenario he views as very bullish. Following this, he anticipates: We proceed with the second resistance at $0.91 (Yellow Resistance) will be broken above $0.66, and XRP will directly proceed with $1.33. Above $1.8815 (In Violet :)), we will discuss –> New All-Time High, possibly at $5.85 at first! At press time, XRP traded at $0.50797. After the price was rejected at the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.5272, the cryptocurrency is now looking for support at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.5083 on the 4-hour chart.

XRP price could start a fresh bullish wave unless there is a close below $0.50. Ripple’s token price is correcting gains from the 0.550 resistance against the US dollar. The price is now trading above $0.505 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $0.504 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it stays above the $0.500 and $0.490 support levels. Ripple’s Token Price Holds Key Support In the last XRP price prediction, we discussed a decent increase against the US Dollar. The price remained well-bid above the $0.520 level and climbed further higher, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price surpassed the $0.532 resistance and tested $0.550. A high was formed near $0.5493 and the price saw a downside correction. There was a move below $0.532 and $0.525. There was a break below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4907 swing low to the $0.5493 high. However, XRP is still trading above $0.505 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $0.504 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair. Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.515 level. Besides, there is a connecting bearish trend line at $0.520. A close above the $0.520 level could send the price toward the $0.532 barrier. A successful break above the $0.532 resistance level might start a strong increase toward the $0.550 resistance. Any more gains might send XRP toward the $0.580 resistance. More Losses in XRP? If ripple fails to clear the $0.532 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5065 zone and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). The next major support is at $0.500. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.500 level, XRP’s price could extend losses. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.475 support zone. Technical Indicators 4-Hours MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. 4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

18315925,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553674,1696305618,Bitcoin Price Action in October: A Probabilistic Overview,"October has traditionally been a pivotal moment for Bitcoin’s price action. Historical data shows an enticing average price increase of 17% for the month (excluding the early, volatile years of Bitcoin). In pre-halving years, this average price fluctuation is slightly higher, around 21%. If the same price change occurs in 2023, Bitcoin could reach somewhere between $32,000 and $33,000 in October. But will this month follow the historical trend, or is a bearish turn still possible? Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To Reach $170,000 in 2025 – Mathematical Model Predicts October Over Time October has been particularly bullish for Bitcoin, with an average of 17% of price increases over the years. Since 2023 is a pre-halving year, comparisons with other pre-halving years are particularly insightful. In the pre-halving years of 2019 and 2015, the average price increase was 20%. Bitcoin monthly returns over the years. Source: intothecryptoverse In 13 years of Bitcoin price action, 9 have seen increases during October. This makes another bullish October seem quite likely. Interestingly, September, known for its bearish tendencies, has broken its pattern this year, with Bitcoin’s price seeing a 5% increase. This is the first instance of such a deviation in over 7 years. This anomaly prompts the question: could October’s price action also diverge from the historical pattern? Bitcoin Price Action In Pre-halving Years Another important caveat to consider is that during pre-halving years, Bitcoin’s price tends to exhibit a predictable pattern where there are 5-6 months when the price decreases. However, 2023 has been an outlier so far, with only three red months observed currently: In the pre-halving years, we get 5-6 red months (usually 6) In 2023, we’ve only had 3 so far. Three months are remaining till the end of the year. So based on probability, we could get three more red months or at the very least, two. pic.twitter.com/lYpykuxO0m — Predycto (@predycto) October 1, 2023 This unexpected deviation could prompt a re-evaluation of what the remaining months of 2023 may hold for Bitcoin. To see the usual six months of price decreases, every month remaining in the calendar year would need to show a reduction. Related Reading: Next Bitcoin Peak: Why It Could Still Be 2 Years Away Bitcoin In 2019: Examining Bitcoin’s price movements in Q4 of 2019 can offer a comparative perspective. Bitcoin's 2023 price comparison with 2019 . Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Q4 2019 showed significant retracements in Bitcoin’s price, as it decreased by 20% from the beginning of October until the end of the year. If we witness similar price movements this year, it will lead to Bitcoin reaching below $22,000, presenting potential opportunities and risks for investors. A Broader Impact Bitcoin’s price movements serve as an indicator of the broader cryptocurrency market. A bearish trend in Bitcoin could potentially lead to a market-wide downturn, causing an even bigger downturn for Altcoins and coins with low market capitalization. Conclusion While October is usually bullish, the anomalies witnessed in 2023 should lead to a more cautious approach to expectations during October. The absence of a bearish September provokes questions about the likelihood of experiencing a bullish October. While history provides guidance, it’s essential to remember it doesn’t dictate the future, and varying factors can alter market behaviors significantly.

Specifically, Ava Labs said Firewood resolves a big concern for expanding blockchains: data management. Ava Labs Releases Firewood To The Public Ava Labs is open-sourcing the code for Firewood for refinement before its final implementation. Eventually, the team wants Firewood to be a choice tool through which blockchain data will be better organized and stored more efficiently. Toward this mission, Ava Labs developers are taking a new approach to storing and managing data, unlike in legacy networks. Blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin use the Merkle Tree structure to organize data. While the system has been replicated widely across emerging ledgers, the Merkle Tree architecture tends to be slow and inefficient whenever the blockchain grows. Related Reading: Bitcoin MPI Forms Death Cross, End of The Rally? Picking out the flaws in the Merkle Tree system, Ava Labs is building Firewood from scratch but with some “enhancements” to the system. Their objective, the statement reads, is to make blockchain data storage and organization smoother. Firewood doesn’t rely on generic tools like LevelDB or RocksDB. Ava Labs claim these tools have been a cause of “misalignment” leading to “significant overhead of either disk I/O, size (not tracking whether state is still used), and serialization/deserialization of Tree data structures to support high-throughput blockchain workloads.” In light of these inefficiencies, the goal is to make Firewood a replacement “for the LevelDB/RocksDB + Merkle Tree.” Ava Labs claims that firewood can help users organize their data storage more “efficiently” with their system. This improvement will allow high throughput storage without constant data cleanup or compression. In the days ahead, Ava Labs revealed that Firewood will be integrated into various parts of the Avalanche. At the same time, the team plans to “release a series of reproducible benchmarks comparing the performance of Firewood to other blockchain databases.” Will Avalanche Rally To $20 And 2023 Highs? The release of Firewood is when AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, has been under immense pressure in 2023. The draw-down, fueled by the bear market and recent comments by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claiming that AVAX is an unregistered security, heaped more pressure on the coin. AVAX is changing hands at $9.53, up 11% from September 2023 lows. However, the coin is down roughly 60% from 2023 highs at around $20. Related Reading: XRP Price Bloodbath On The Horizon?

18311555,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553827,1696294828,Is Your Crypto at Risk? FBI Issues Dire Warning Over ‘Phantom Hacker’,"As the crypto market continues to attract substantial investments, it has also witnessed a surge in scams and fraudulent activities. Regulatory institutions worldwide, spearheaded by the United States, seem to intensify their efforts to combat cyber threats, hacks, and frauds that affect the industry. However, the nascent sector is far from the only one suffering from increasing cyber threats. Since 2020, these attacks have been common both within the crypto space and outside. In line with this, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified a new threat dubbed “The Phantom Menace.” The FBI issued a warning on September 29, alerting the public about the escalating “Phantom Hacker” scams, particularly affecting senior citizens. FBI Warns Of ‘Phantom Hacker’ Scams Targeting Crypto The FBI’s statement revealed that the “Phantom Hacker” scam is an evolution of traditional tech support scams, employing imposter tech support, fraudulent exchange account support, and government personas to gain victims’ trust. This multi-layered approach helps scammers identify lucrative accounts to target. Related Reading: XRP Price Bloodbath On The Horizon? Report Casts Doubt On Recent Rally From January to June 2023, the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) received over 19,000 complaints about tech support and crypto scams, resulting in estimated losses exceeding $542 million. Losses have already surpassed 2022 figures by 40% as of August 2023. The Scam Phases: In the initial phase of the scam, fraudsters adopt the guise of tech or customer support representatives from legitimate companies. They reach out to their victims through various communication channels and employ persuasive tactics to convince them to call a designated number for assistance. Once victims are connected, scammers manipulate them into downloading software that grants remote access to their computers. By fabricating a fictitious virus scan, scammers deceive victims into believing their computers have been compromised or are at risk. Subsequently, they coax victims into opening their financial accounts, allowing scammers to identify the most lucrative targets. Upon successfully gaining access to victims’ financial accounts, scammers proceed to the second phase of the scam. In this stage, they assume the role of representatives from reputable financial institutions such as banks or brokerage firms. The scammers falsely inform victims that foreign hackers have compromised their computers and accounts. To ensure the safety of victims’ funds, they instruct victims to transfer their money to a purportedly “secure” third-party account, often claiming an affiliation with recognized entities like the Federal Reserve or other US government agencies. These transfers typically involve wire transfers, cash, or even cryptocurrencies, with the funds predominantly sent overseas. Scammers coerce victims into maintaining secrecy regarding the true purpose of these transfers. Rise In Ransomware Attacks In contrast with the alarming rise of “Phantom Hacker” scams, a Chainalysis report indicates an overall decline in cryptocurrency-related crime in 2023. Cumulative daily inflows to known illicit entities have decreased by 65% compared to the same period in 2022. Notably, scams have experienced the most significant decline, with scammers generating nearly $3.3 billion less revenue in 2023 than in 2022. However, the report highlights a concerning trend: ransomware attacks. Ransomware attackers extorted $175.8 million more by June 2023 than during the same period in 2022, suggesting a reversal from the downward trend observed in 2022.

18309979,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553808,1696291257,"Crypto Fund Flows: Bitcoin Leads As Solana Follows, But Why’s Ethereum Left Behind?","Investment products in the crypto arena have recently reported net inflows of $21 million, breaking a persistent six-week drought. With the crypto market’s future continuously debated among experts, such inflows mark a possible resurgence of confidence among investors. The top cryptocurrency remained at the forefront of this resurgence, capturing most of the inflow. But as Bitcoin continues its dominance, emerging coins like Solana also signify the diversifying landscape of the crypto world. Amid these positive indicators, the Ethereum token, however, tells a different story. Related Reading: Crypto’s Six-Week Bleed Out: XRP And Solana Defy The Outflow Downtrend Bitcoin And Solana Shine, Ethereum Faces The Heat Leading the pack, Bitcoin funds reported an inflow of roughly $20.4 million in the past week. In sharp contrast, investment products betting on Bitcoin’s decline witnessed an outflow of $1.5 million, suggesting a significant retreat from negative market sentiments. James Butterfill, CoinShares’ Head of Research, pointed out the sustained relinquishment of short positions on Bitcoin, indicating a potential bullish sentiment for the top crypto. Solana, a rising star in the crypto ecosystem, continued to impress. Reporting inflows for the 27th week this year, it added $5.1 million to its coffers, reiterating its strong market position. Butterfill acclaimed Solana’s consistent performance, noting, “Solana continues to shine,” emphasizing its resilience in a year that has seen numerous altcoins fluctuate. On the flip side, Ethereum products haven’t mirrored this positive trend. Despite being one of the leading cryptocurrencies, it registered outflows for the seventh week. Butterfill labeled Ethereum as the current “least loved” altcoin. Global Reactions And Influencing Factors On Crypto Geographical dissections of the inflow trends offer noteworthy insights. While Europe and Canada embraced the crypto resurgence with inflows of $23 million and $17 million, respectively, the US displayed contrasting sentiments, pulling out $19 million. Butterfill links this unexpected inflow towards the week’s end to a blend of positive price momentum, apprehensions regarding US government debt prices, and the recent impasse over governmental funding. However, Butterfill also highlighted the low trading volumes across the investment product and crypto markets. Amid these crypto currents, blockchain equities failed to catch the same wind, seeing outflows totaling $8.4 million. This trend mirrors the broader tech sector’s direction, which also leaned towards a sell-off, as pointed out by Butterfill.
