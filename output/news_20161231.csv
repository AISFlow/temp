42399517,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjcR4,1483198607,Not Just Bitcoin: The Top 7 Cryptocurrencies All Gained in 2016,"In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, CoinDesk contributor Frederick Reese gives an overview of trends in the digital currency and digital asset markets.  2016 has been an exciting year for cryptocurrencies.  With most of the major open-source currencies showing growth this year and with some expected to see significant expansion in 2017, 2016 reflects a loss of faith in traditional money systems in light of the global populism trend and a growing confidence in the underlying technologies in play for crypto transactions.  As the year comes to an end, CoinDesk took a moment to look at the best-performing cryptocurrencies by market capitalization for the year and the factors that affected the markets throughout the year.  For the sake of this analysis, we are looking at a review period of December 27, 2015 to December 26, 2016.  Bitcoin  Market Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $6,161,215,794  Market Capitalization (End of Year): $14,590,356,108  Price (Beginning of Year): $411.99  Price (End of Year): $908.17  Price (Annual High): $909.94  In 2016, bitcoin remained the king of cryptocurrencies.  The world's oldest blockchain-based asset proved to be a ""little engine that could,” booming dependably in times of macroeconomic uncertainty.  While bitcoin failed to reach a new all-time high, the digital currency still rebounded from a low of under $400 to achieve an almost three-year high of $982.87 on 29th December.  As of the writing of this article, the price was still at the upper end of the year's range, exceeding $950 per bitcoin.  Though shallow markets could also be a factor, bitcoin prices and trading volume were supported by an extraordinary set of global circumstances (at least, according to analysts and investors).  These included the devaluation of the Chinese yuan, the UK's decision to leave the EU, and the unpredictability of a Donald Trump presidency.  Yet, despite this, bitcoin remained in the middle of the pack by metrics such as year-to-date valuation change and toward the bottom in terms change in market capitalization by percentage.  However, bitcoin’s large valuation arguably makes its positive growth more significant to the global investment community.  Still, most of the trading activity remains centered in Asia, as Chinese trading volume continued to exceeded US trading volume by significant multitudes.  As seen above, some of the largest Chinese miners and exchanges – OKCoin, Huobi, BTCC, Bitfinex and LakeBTC – dominated global bitcoin trading this year.  The drop in the yuan may be the reason for all this activity, however, with reports of the Chinese government exploring ways to resolve the obvious bypassing of its capital controls, the local scene may eventually become more subdued.  Ethereum  Market Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $80,339,474  Market Capitalization (End of Year): $638,041,577  Price (Beginning of Year): $2.83  Price (End of Year): $7.31  Price (Annual High): $19.59  2016 saw ether – the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum network – become one of the world's best-performing currencies, despite a well-publicized hack.  With a more than 2,000% increase over the first six months of the year and a nearly 300% increase for the calendar year, the pioneering blockchain for decentralized applications suffered from high volatility, perhaps due to its relative newcomer status.  The most significant factors in the instability of the ether price were the DAO hack, the subsequent collapse of the autonomous organization, and the creation of ethereum classic. These actions, occuring in June and July, saw an erosion of nearly 50% of the altcoin’s worth in less than two days.  It's important to understand what affect the creation of ethereum classic had on ethereum (see above image).  While valuation recovered to a certain degree, the successive forking of the blockchain led to a steady decline in prices.  However, as ethereum is currently being seen as the preferred network for possible FinTech permissioned distributed ledgers, enterprise software and Internet of Things applications, 2017 could show a capitalization increase for ether.  Ripple  Market Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $206,189,522  Market Capitalization (End of Year): $231,713,026  Price (Beginning of Year): $0.006168  Price (End of Year): $0.006310  Price (Annual High): $0.009358  To begin with, it's important to recognize the clear the distinction between an open blockchain asset such as bitcoin, and one that operates on a permissioned ledger overseen by a private company, like Ripple's XRP token.  Yet, seeing where this upstart lies on the cryptocurrency map helps to understand what happened in other markets this year.  Serving as an intermediary for instantaneously converting one currency to another, there are no retailers that accept XRP.  Despite this – and maybe because of the potential XRP has for regulated cross-border commerce – Ripple did show significant potential for growth and currently has the second highest market capitalization among publicly traded cryptocurrencies.  Despite this, XRP ended this year close to its opening price, though it did see some noteworthy volatility along the way.  The largest spike came in September following investments from major financial firms such as Standard Chartered and Siam Capital.  Litecoin  Market Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $149,142,004  Market Capitalization (End of Year): $212,469,870  Price (Beginning of Year): $3.41  Price (End of Year): $4.34  Price (Annual High): $5.55  One of the oldest of the bitcoin alternatives, litecoin showed one of the more stable valuation curves for 2016. Closing more than $2 above its starting price for the year, litecoin showed gradual but steady growth in value.  This was disturbed, however, by two events.  In June, litecoin saw its upward spike – which was fueled by the recovery in valuation from the altcoin's 2015 reward halving and by the lowering of mining difficulty – grow significantly in response to the Brexit vote.  This, as with bitcoin and most of the world’s fiat currencies, led to the strengthening of the US dollar’s value against the litecoin and caused a significant price drop.  Then, in August, VC-backed startup Coinbase added litecoin to GDAX for dollar trading, which cause a temporary spike in pricing.  Monero  Market Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $4,707,521  Market Capitalization (End of Year): $133,545,372  Price (Beginning of Year): $0.448294  Price (End of Year): $10.38  Price (Annual High): $13.50  As far as market capitalization growth as a percentage goes, monero is far and away alone in the pack.  With a monetization that went from $4.7m at the beginning of our observation period to a high of nearly $168m, monero made skeptics of this non-bitcoin derivative eat their words and rethink their portfolios.  The primary reason for monero's rapid valuation increase was its adoption as a preferred currency by the DarkNet market AlphaBay.  While this brings up the ghosts of bitcoin's use in dark markets, the exposure served to help mainstream the formerly obscure altcoin.  ""Alphabay Market is now implementing monero,"" reads a press release on Reddit. ""Following the demand from the community, and considering the security features of monero, we decided to add it to our marketplace.""  This was followed by the currency’s adoption by Oasis Market, another DarkNet marketplace, and by extensive coverage by Vice, ZDNet and others.  However, as monero pricing is subject to the same hype market that affects other cryptocurrencies, the price spike collapsed in the post-summer cool down, only to ratchet up again following news of Donald Trump’s election win.  Ethereum Classic  Market Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $47,874,732  Market Capitalization (End of Year): $90,639,072  Price (At Creation): $0.58  Price (End of Year): $1.05  Price (Annual High): $3.30  If XMR represented the highest percent of annual growth for 2016, classic ether represents the highest percentage of price loss for the year.  The result of a hard fork to refund the out-of-pocket token holders of The DAO after the 18th June hack, ethereum classic (ETC) formed due to a split in the ethereum community in which some felt that ""code is law"", the blockchain is immutable and that any attempt to correct a “permitted” action defies the purpose and value of the blockchain.  The controversial split created a high amount of enthusiasm amongst some traders, which saw classic ether’s prices climb well above $2 and 24-hour trade volume to over $133m at its highest.  The 24-hour trade volume at the end of our observation period is less than $750,000, with a low of about $205,000 on 20th November, as per CoinMarketCap.  The notion of a double blockchain has always been a troubling and something bitcoin has desperately sought to avoid, as having two competing, identical blockchain could possibly erode confidence in one or both. It would seem that this is exactly what happened with ethereum classic – as ethereum rose, ethereum classic sank.  However, there is some light at the end of this tunnel: classic has made as much as a 37% comeback in December, due to aggressive trading by the Chinese altcoin community. With a spike in hashrate, it is likely that this uptick may be part of a long-term trend.  Dash  Market Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $16,081.586  Market Capitalization (End of Year): $70,675,107  Price (Beginning of Year): $2.64  Price (End of Year): $9.67  Price (Annual High): $14.42  In 2015, darkcoin decided to end its association with shadow businesses and the DarkNet by changing its name to Dash.  ""Recently it became apparent that our branding was getting in the way of our mission, so we started investigating rebranding,"" said Dash lead developer Evan Duffield to IBTimes at the time. ""We believe Dash, which stands for digital cash, is a great representation of what we want to become.""  “That's the way that Bitcoin started and it eventually moved away from that and more into legitimate areas, so I'm guessing that [Dash] will go the same route.”  This rebranding seemed to work. Dash ended its year with pricing nearly three times, and a market capitalization close to four times, where they started the year.  Powered by its Darksend system, transactions are virtually untraceable on the Dash network, making Dash and its Masternodes' batch-processing of transactions a preferred choice for anonymity-seekers.  It's important to note, however, that Dash still has its fair share of vocal detractors, so the verdict is still out on its potential.  Conclusion  As we enter 2017, the future for the cryptocurrency market is looking bright.  While some digital currencies, like bitcoin, may hit new highs, and others, like ethereum and ethereum classic, will fight for position, the digital currency/digital asset market will continue to progress and prove its worth as one of the top-performing commodities available today.  At the same time, innovations in blockchain interactions, FinTech integration and anonymity-assurance will make cryptocurrencies in 2017 closer to the ideal imagined by Satoshi Nakamoto and the early pioneers of the technology.  Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the date darkcoin rebranding as Dash.

42399504,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjcFG,1483160183,2016: The Year of Blockchain Hubris,"Chris DeRose is a software developer, bitcoin evangelist and the controversial co-host of the podcast Bitcoin Uncensored.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, DeRose provides his recap of the year that was, looking at ideas he believes proved fruitless for innovators.  Inconvenient as it may be for some, blockchain is booming.  Despite challenges in other areas, blockchain's use as a value routing protocol is developing at blistering speeds, and I would argue, with amazing results. If you know where to look, you can see labor specializing, banking services being extended and information services being globalized.  So, why does everyone seem to be talking about the technology's potential tomorrow? It turns out the real 'disruption' is not as uncontroversial or straightforward as some have promised.  For speculators that arrived in 2016 looking to strike it rich, it would seem that the chance of finding success in areas outside of the technology's original purpose (value routing) seem increasingly unlikely. That means the biggest success stories are companies focusing on that – not trying to win investors outsized returns.  Profitable businesses such as Nitrogensports and Alphabay (not to mention good-old ransomware) are in no short supply – but like any business that relies on regulatory arbitrage, these companies and individuals don't gloat on progress.  Big banks and private blockchain supporters won't likely acknowledge the success of these businesses anytime soon. But that's not to say that these businesses aren't drivers of real change – even perhaps more so than the industry startups that seem so fond of press releases.  While some may cast judgement on these businesses, preliminary studies are showing that their successes could reduce health and crime costs compared to incumbent technologies – and that may even improve computer security by incentivizing users to chose better written software.  Whether they'll succeed in this endeavor is a topic for 2017 to address.  For now, as 2016 comes to a close and bitcoin ascends up the hype cycle's slope of enlightenment, let's look back what went wrong, and what was outright stupid, during the 2016 blockchain fever.  1. Blockchains without the token  The idea that a 'blockchain' could exist without the use of a publicy traded token made its first appearance as early as 2014. Pitched as a best-of-both-worlds, the idea was simple – banks liked the idea of 'bitcoin' the payment rail and settlement system, but didn’t exactly care for 'bitcoin' the currency.  Now, there are signs that this idea may have finally culminated with the struggles of startups like banking consortium R3 and post-trade distributed ledger startup Digital Asset Holdings.  Though digital bearer asset technology (the technology behind bitcoin) required a financial reward to compensate the entities that provide its immutability (miners), these firms were quick to offer solutions that promised to remove this supposed burden.  However, by the close of the year it quickly became evident that at least some of their initial supporters weren't buying the pitch.  It would seem private blockchain firms have decided that 'blocks' of data aren't actually an efficiency, and that 'sharing facts' is 'the technology behind bitcoin' that will add value for their supporters.  Digital Asset Holdings has go so far as to remove most of the references to blockchain in its newest site redesign, touting the newest fintech buzzword du jour 'distributed ledger technology' instead.  As to what these value propositions might have to do with the scientific deifinition of blockchain… well, it would seem that the hope is no one will ask.  2. ICOs  Though I've written extensively on the topic of ICOs in prior articles, no article on the fumbles of blockchain would be complete without at least a passing mention to the 2016 altcoin rebrand.  In recognizing that the allure of the 'bitcoin get rich quick' dream is fading, exchanges such as Coinbase have pivoted toward the newest marketing gimmick as a means to supplanting bitcoin's dying speculative fever.  Of course, whether a US exchange could successfully sustain growth by arbitraging SEC regulations (and labeling digital securities 'blockchain'), remains to be seen.  However, as the year comes to a close, it would appear that the SEC is not going to accept the pitch in whole. And while the ICO proponents are eager to suggest that this model of speculative trading is going to bring greater attention and funding to software developers, to date, I would argue there has yet to be even a single example of success.  Outside the anecdotal stories of insider traders whose exit positions left themselves rich at the expense of late-coming greater fools, utility for these coins remains thoroughly unclear.  To date, the vast majority of 'appcoins' or 'blockchain tokens' remain on exchange's books, ready to be sold by unscrupulous speculators to the newcomers without even a single consumer to be found.  3. Turing-complete smart contracts  It would seem that the advantages of concealing logic and iteratively publishing code are becoming far more obvious.  Thus far, all attempts to find an efficiency by publishing code in a blockchain have fallen flat.  Though many have attempted 'Uber clones', 'prediction markets', 'cloud storage' (basically all successful Web businesses, but with the blockchain) – the only successes that I can see have been found in automated ponzis, provably fair ponzis and outright explicit gambling ponzis.  As people search for use cases where the inordinate overhead of a Turing-complete smart contract finds a net efficiency, the few cases of censorship-prone algorithms such as gambling, darknets and ransomware are meeting almost no enforcement action that would prevent HTTP and Tor from solving their problems.  Meanwhile, the overhead and complexity involved in maintaining a smart contract-enabled blockchain like ethereum has resulted largely only in continuous comedy memes.  4. DAOs  For others in 2016, blockchain seemed poised to displace one the oldest of institutions in our modern world – the corporation.  Thus, 'distributed autonomous organizations' were presented as a solution to the perceived 'evils' of profit-seeking middlemen.  The pitch of DAO proponents would appear to be that smart contract code itself could facilitate market efficiencies through its own cognizance – and without the leadership and direction provided by a traditional group of employees, founders and decision makers.  Many in this pro-DAO camp were seemingly unaware that much like code itself, corporations require constant iterative development and direction in response to pressure from competitors and changes in regulatory and technological environments.  However, after the DAO exploded (and made the opportunity costs of immutable code obvious) – fans of this pursuit are in shorter supply.  5. Trust in banking  When Digital Asset CEO Blythe Masters took the stage of the American Banker conference in 2015, she declared that she believed banks trust each other enough to share financial details.  The purpose of blockchain, according to Masters, is that it would dispense 'proprietary information' and enable regulators and banks alike to benefit together, reducing asymmetric data in the marketplace.  Unfortunately, in the time since that announcement, banks have not only distanced themselves from consortium initiatives, they have begun filing patents with the intent of guaranteeing control over the technology.  Further, these institutions have started to ask what can be done to obscure their information from being disclosed in their 'transparency' initiatives.  While most successful business owners have long ago discovered that asymmetric control of market information is the efficiency that their business provides, blockchain leaders are just now coming around to this realization.  Such realizations pose, yet again, the question of just what it is we're even trying to achieve with transparency initiatives.  6. Oracles  No, not smart contract oracles – people as oracles!  Newcomers to the bitcoin and blockchain space this year arrived bright-eyed and hopeful that certain individuals possessed the innate knowledge necessary to navigate this brave new world.  In 2016, 'oracles' appeared and delivered this information to the crowds.  Initial promises and prognostications were offered by the likes of Balaji Srinivasan, Vitalik Buterin and Andreas Antonopolous – but these individuals were displaced by new oracles such as Don Tapscott, William Mougayar and Bettina Warburg.  As the new round of oracles drifted even further into the realm of hyperbole and exaggeration, the blockchain space began to sound like a feel-good echo chamber.  For many of the 2016 newcomers, 'blockchain' was the savior of the day, and to ask what a blockchain even was became taboo.  Yet, by the year’s end, the lack of clothes for each of these attempted emperors would become painfully obvious. It would appear that in an exotic new specialty such as blockchain, there are few qualifications that would enable anyone to evaluate claims.  7. Blockchain regulation  It seems clear now that the efficiency of blockchain is regulatory arbitrage.  But in 2016, some came to this space with the goal of applying this technology to the realm of regulated commerce. And their success has been limited.  I have long argued that the regulations that are likely to improve blockchain adoption are those that increase and expand the censorship of credit cards and digital payments that would otherwise service its potential markets.  These restrictions act as subsidies, which in turn fuel the adoption rate of blockchain.  In this light, one could go so far as to say that the people who are most hard at work advancing these regulations are the members of America's law enforcement, and more specifically, the people who employ them.  Whatever function blockchain regulatory groups can offer for these people would appear to be, at their very best, misguided.  Whether this lesson has been learned in 2016 is yet to be determined, but signs are pointing toward ""maybe"".  8. 'The Next Big Thing'  It is certain that there will be further blockchain innovations down the line – however, scandals and scams continued to define the industry.  In this light, I'd argue that the successes that await us are unlikely to come via the funding of bold new blockchain ideas, but by the mechanism which brought the innovatoin of bitcoin in the first place.  Humble, simple propositions, brought by specialists working in solitude, who came to scratch their own itch.  Perhaps this will be the lesson of 2016. Time will tell.
