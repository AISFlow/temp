The funds are broken up between two quarters, $2.4 million in Q3 and an additional $8.9 million in Q4, for a total of $11.3 million. The Q4 ""financial benefit"" as MoneyGram calls the sum, was not included in its Q4 revenue, reported as $323.7 million. Instead, it was accounted for a contra expense in its operating expense on the recommendation of the SEC. That required MoneyGram to restate its revenue down by $2.4 million but cut operating costs by the same amount, leaving earnings unchanged.

42383365,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vJfV,1582665913,IOTA Being Shut Off Is the Latest Chapter in an Absurdist History,"The IOTA coordinator node responsible for confirming all transactions has been offline for more than 12 days, yet the token remains listed as one of the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap, according to OnChainFX. Its price even went up.      There are few cryptocurrencies as notorious as IOTA, which skyrocketed from $0.34 a token in November 2017 to $5.36 by the top of the token boom in December 2017. Eric Wall, CIO of the Nordic cryptocurrency investment firm Arcane Assets, described the project as “the worst coin to have gotten as high as it did.”      “The sort of meta-question the industry is asking itself is whether IOTA can successfully keep their partnerships and convert themselves into somewhat of a success by replacing the technology pieces as they go, without having had any viable plan whatsoever when they began,” Wall said. “They're pushing the boundaries of the fake-it-till-you-make-it approach to the extreme.”      Back at the peak in 2017, I was a green crypto reporter approached by the press team for former beauty queen and reality TV contestant Jessica VerSteeg, who wanted to open a cannabis business in California. We’d seen press releases about an “official partnership” between the Germany-based IOTA Foundation and Microsoft, which the incumbent tech company later denied, as well as various universities. VerSteeg wanted to use the IOTA protocol, named for its proposed functionality with internet-of-things (IoT) devices, in a coworking space for cannabis startups.      The MIT Tech Review ran a scathing review of the IOTA protocol’s insecurities, but plenty of other reputable institutions appeared to endorse the project by inviting the founders to speak about IOTA at academic and professional events. Wall described this as the founding team, which launched the IOTA token in 2015, being “very effective at pushing out news about ‘partnerships.’”    Among technologists, the IOTA Foundation became known for scandalous emailshttp://www.tangleblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/letters.pdf in 2018 between IOTA Foundation co-founder David Sonstebo and Neha Narula of MIT's Digital Currency Initiative. He accused the researcher of helping CoinDesk prematurely publish vulnerabilities in the IOTA software and violating professional disclosure norms. (She denied both.) By 2019, members of the IOTA community earned a reputation for routinely harassing women security experts, like Open Privacy founder Sarah Jamie Lewis, who found flaws in IOTA research.    Plus, VerSteeg’s token-friendly coworking venture for the cannabis industry shuttered after fines from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The website and social media accounts for the token project are still up, but her personal social media accounts haven’t been active since the fall of 2019.      (Sonstebo denied working with VerSteeg, despite the fact that my 2017 article quoted him speaking about the project.) VerSteeg could not be reached for comment. Her old email accounts bounce back and former press associates don’t know how to reach her. IOTA co-founder Dominik Schiener said he doesn’t know what happened to her and working together “turned out to be a mistake.”      None of this quelled interest in the project. The IOTA subreddit, with more than 114,000 subscribers, still has hundreds of daily active users and the nonprofit is now a member of the Linux Foundation.    Single point of failure    The IOTA Foundation turned off the coordinator node in February 2020 to stop an attacker from stealing funds from the foundation’s wallet service for retail investors, highlighting the fundamental challenge of decentralizing a crypto project.      ""The cryptography community doesn't even know what to say about them at this point,” said cryptographer Mario Costa, who works on the XX Network. “First their custom-made hash-function was broken and you could forge transactions. Now they had to shut down their network because their wallet was hacked. This is insane because you should not be able to shut down a decentralized network.""      IOTA’s Schiener said the vulnerability, which led to stolen funds from 50 IOTA holders, came from a botched integration job with the fiat-to-crypto broker MoonPay.      “It was not absolutely secure, in terms of the infrastructure that we’d done,” he admitted, adding the foundation is fixing the code and researching a mechanism for no longer relying on the foundation’s coordinator node. He said that will make the network of roughly 1,000 regular nodes “truly decentralized.”      The hack came just days after another IOTA Foundation scandal, when co-founder Sergey Ivancheglo left the foundation and demanded 25 million IOTA tokens as his share of the project (worth roughly $6.3 million). Sonstebo said the team has matured since they feuded with academics in the past, but Schiener’s blog post about the split used troubling language.      Schiener referred to the IOTA Foundation as “the brand which I single-handedly conceived” and that “naturally” his former colleague will never “own it [IOTA]” again. Even if Schiener means a proverbial share in the non-profit, not tokens, both men referred to IOTA as “my” assets or project, which may contradict the idea that they aim to create a decentralized network. The funds they are referring to, Sonstebo said, are 51 million IOTA tokens people bought but haven’t claimed from the sale.      “We haven’t had requests since 2017,” Sonstebo said of those unclaimed tokens.      However, Sonstebo said the founders didn’t allot themselves any tokens and that the foundation’s staff of 120 people are paid through a combination of community donations and corporate consulting gigs. Unlike the Ethereum Foundation, so far there aren’t any clients using the IOTA protocol beyond research and pilots, which sometimes include patents. As such, the nonprofit’s priority this year is finding a partner for live products.      “This year we’re really focused on making sure our technology is mature enough to have real, live products,” Schiener said.",NEGATIVE,IOTA,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | IOTA,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/25/iota-being-shut-off-is-the-latest-chapter-in-an-absurdist-history,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f6eb907c9dec8f504c670990ca7e8b3816f1675-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383361,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vJaT,1582663811,Bank of Canada Won't Issue Its Own Crypto Unless Libra Succeeds: Deputy Governor,"The Bank of Canada has no plans to issue its own digital currency – at least, not at the moment.      The central bank does not see a real need to issue its own cryptocurrency unless a competitor to cash takes off, said Deputy Governor Timothy Lane. His speech, titled ""Money and Payments in the Digital Age,"" addressed how the central bank is approaching the idea of central bank digital currencies; in his view, cash works.      To be sure, Bank of Canada was one of the most active students of the CBDC concept, and it ran a pilot project on R3's distributed ledger tech solution Corda. Last May, the project was live-tested in a cross-border settlement trial with the Monetary Authority of Singapore.      However, in the end, the regulator wasn’t that impressed.      “We have concluded that there is not a compelling case to issue a CBDC at this time. Canadians will continue to be well-served by the existing payment ecosystem, provided it is modernized and remains fit for purpose,” Lane said.      The widespread use of private cryptocurrencies could change this calculation, he said. Lane described such cryptocurrencies as “a monopoly that would erode competition and privacy and pose an unacceptable challenge to Canadian monetary sovereignty.""      The most obvious threat is Libra, the stablecoin initially championed by Facebook and now led by a group of companies. While there is currently no timeline on the stablecoin's launch, individuals associated with the project have confirmed that development is continuing despite a harsh reaction from the global community.      “It’s tough to predict if Libra will ever live up to its promises or even come into existence. But it is a good example of a transformative technology that affects how the bank needs to respond to the future of money,” Lane said.      For now, the Bank of Canada plans to do more exploratory work and consultations with central banks including the U.K., Sweden, Switzerland, Japan, the EU and the Bank of International Settlements as part of a group effort formed earlier this month.      The Bank of Canada will also consult with the “governments and key stakeholders in provinces and territories across Canada” to learn if they want a CBDC and how they want it, Lane said.      Overall, if one day Canadians ultimately abandon cash or turn to private cryptocurrencies, the country will need a digital cash “issued and distributed by an organization that is guided by the interest of the public good, rather than profit” and “backed by a central bank’s balance sheet and its reputation for preserving the value of our money,” Lane concluded.      The speech echoed the sentiments voiced by representatives of the Bank of Canada's peers, which gathered at a CBDC-focused conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, last week. Central bankers from the Netherlands, Ukraine, Uruguay and other countries shared a common view that central banks probably don't need anything blockchain-like for a digital payment system.      However popular the new digital fixtures are, the Bank of Canada strongly believes in, and is determined to preserve, paper cash “to make sure that Canadians who wish to use bank notes can continue to do so.” In particular, the regulator is contemplating a new design for a C$5 bank note, Lane said.      “The bank is in the midst of a wide consultation process to ask Canadians who they want as the portrait subject of this new bank note,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/25/bank-of-canada-wont-issue-its-own-crypto-unless-libra-succeeds-deputy-governor,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11f6f5638eda3b3b5e92b5647a23b9fdf938f425-1440x900.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Although investors from previous rounds have also participated, the company has not disclosed any other names. Revolut looks to challenge existing traditional banks, for example by undercutting their prices on services.      Tuesday's news means the company has now raised a total of $836 million in its funding rounds.      Launched in 2015, Revolut provides its 10 million users with easy access to a host of financial services. New users can open an account in minutes, and the company has expanded the number of supported features including adding an equity trading platform and insurance brokerage.      Revolut added bitcoin (BTC) to its platform in July 2017, soon after its $66 million Series B. Ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC) followed later that year, with bitcoin cash (BCH) and XRP (XRP) support coming in May 2018. Revolut allows users to send cryptocurrencies to other users in the app but does not allow them to send to any external users or pay for goods and services in crypto using the Revolut card.      Revolut said funding will improve existing products and services as well as expand its outreach outside of its U.K. base.

Wants to Survey Firms on Cross-Border Crypto Usage,"The U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has proposed a rule change to a benchmark survey that would require all U.S. financial services companies to identify if they engaged in cross-border services related to cryptocurrency.      Alongside wider rule changes to the ""BE-180 Benchmark Survey of Financial Services Transactions between U.S. Financial Services Providers and Foreign Persons"" – a mandatory questionnaire BEA issues every five years – the crypto proposal would, if implemented, give Commerce Department statisticians a more precise look at the prevalence of foreign crypto activity.      The survey will be posed to brokerages, private equity funds, custody services, financial advisories and the many others included in BEA’s sweeping definition of ""financial services."" BEA estimates that 7,000 respondents will reply.      ""BEA will add a single question asking respondents to identify, of their 2019 cross-border financial services reported in the required transaction categories, any that were related to cryptocurrency activities,” the rule change read in part.      That question, however, will not gather individual transaction information, said BEA Services and Surveys Branch Chief Christopher Stein. A brokerage that facilitates the cross-border trade of crypto assets would only indicate that it did so, leaving out more granular details like transaction amounts.      ""We are not collecting data related to the physical currency asset,"" Stein said. ""We are not collecting separate dollar amounts related to these services, we're just emphasizing that, for example, a facilitating-type brokerage fee associated with the currency transaction is within the scope of the survey.""      When BE-180 was last held in 2015, the survey did not mention cryptocurrency transactions, but Stein said they were nonetheless included within the survey's scope. The proposed definition amounts to a bureaucratic clarification as cryptocurrency develops.      ""It's a new and evolving area in the financial services market, and the benchmark is an opportunity to ask more information and clarify survey requirements,"" he said.      The proposal package said the rule changes will ""allow BEA to more closely align its statistics with international guidelines."" Its data will be used to ""monitor"" U.S. and international financial services, promote trade and help ""U.S. businesses to identify and evaluate market opportunities,” the package proposal said.

42383336,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vHR7,1582647875,Securities Law Helped Build Modern Capitalism. Crypto Should Embrace It,"Bruce Fenton is CEO of Chainstone Labs, which owns Atlantic Financial, the Satoshi Roundtable and Watchdog Capital, an SEC registered broker-dealer.      In 1602, the Dutch East India Company launched a new structure of ownership called the joint stock company. For the first time, investors could own and trade small pieces of businesses called shares. This invention changed the world.      Securities are one of the most crucial components to the operation of our global economy. Many types of securities have become heavily regulated over the last century. This isn’t a discussion in favor of the regulations (many are overly burdensome and outdated) but it does point to the importance of securities as a structure.      The logistics of operating and fundraising for public companies is hard work. Fundraising is a process with lots of friction, compliance requirements and paperwork. The ongoing operation of a public company can have complex management issues. For large companies, this is typically handled by trusted third parties like DTCC, which provides clearing and depository services. If we can make this easier, it could have a massive positive impact. Distributed ledgers allow us to replace trusted third parties and have a blockchain manage the ledger. This makes securities move more easily and quickly.      The invention of distributed ledgers, bitcoin (BTC) and blockchains is not the same as the invention of the joint stock company and Dutch East India Co. It’s not a new economic model; it’s a new technology and tool that improves how ledgers work. The invention is more similar to the printing press, the computer or the internet. It’s a big deal, but it’s not an invention that changes existing laws of economics. Just as bitcoin doesn’t change the properties of money but finds a way to improve on money, tokens don’t change the fundamentals of investing; they improve on the existing inventions. Think of it as an evolution from paper stock certificates to something better than paper but where the fundamentals of the underlying legal structure stay the same. Just because we invented a better form of paper doesn’t mean we should scrap the most productive and proven legal instrument in history for an unproven model of widgets with no terms. Instead of reinventing the bicycle, let’s improve on a proven model and update the Dutch East India Co. model for a new century.      In 2016, when I saw some of the first of the new wave of initial coin offerings (ICO), I had two simultaneous reactions:      1. Wow, this is amazing.      2. Wow, this is in violation of securities regulations.      I’ve been registered in the securities business in some form for 28 years now. Since I was 19 and done billions of dollars in transactions. So I knew it was possible to comply with the regulations. Rather than trying to avoid being a security, I figured the right choice for most companies would be to simply embrace being a security and focus on complying with regulations. This is a key difference from how many looked at it in the early days and how some still do. This isn’t because I think the regulations are great, but because I know they are unavoidable.      The first time I heard of the Securities and Exchange Commission was at about age seven when my stockbroker Mom came home and told us that the SEC, Federal Bureau of Investigation and police had arrested someone in her firm who broke the rules. I thought this was fascinating. Only 12 years later I had my first job in a brokerage where the seriousness of federal laws was emphasized in our training. These rules have been around for 87 years and are not going anywhere.    This is the equivalent of a marijuana activist opening an unlicensed dispensary in Times Square.    Forget trying to ignore the laws or hoping they go away or thinking “this tech makes it different.” Advocacy also matters little relative to old laws affecting trillions of dollars. Some in crypto think they can just build to violate these laws; it doesn’t work that way. This is the equivalent of a marijuana activist opening an unlicensed dispensary in Times Square. Some may support the ideology, but it would be an ineffective activist action.      In the first ICO wave, many focused on trying to prove “utility” so they wouldn’t be classified as a security. Today we still see similar efforts from some exchanges. For example, Coinbase’s Crypto Ratings Council makes a case for why certain instruments are not securities, instead of doing the harder work to become licensed to deal in legal securities.      Many DeFi projects, and efforts such as Hester Peirce’s ""Safe Harbor"" proposal, continue down the same road. The goal is to avoid being a security. I think this is a mistake.      The Securities Act of 1933 defines a security very broadly:    any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a “security,” or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing.    Here’s the key problem: If you remove terms like profit sharing, equity or debt so something doesn’t meet the definition above, it’s a lot less likely to succeed as an investment. Investments are to pool capital and share risk. In exchange for those risks, investors get something from the definition above: they get dividends for a share of profits, they get their loan paid back or they own equity or something else. If you strip out those terms then the investor isn’t sharing in a business enterprise or investment contract and is really unlikely to make any money because they aren’t participating in any proven economic terms.      Good investments historically share the terms described in the 1933 Act, and a new thing called a token doesn’t change this economic reality. A token that’s not a security is by definition something that gives you no equity, no profit sharing, no investment contract and no ability to depend on the management of others. In other words, it’s a widget with a lot of risk and no proven way to be compensated for that risk. Purchasers who buy these protocol coins often are just getting a gift certificate to a store no one shops at, not a real investment. Also, protocols are quite hard to create and even harder to have real value. A protocol with a fundraise has an additional hurdle in that the fundraise makes them more centralized.      These terms in the 1933 Act definition are very broad on purpose and courts have ruled that they should be broad. We can’t really change that. Any major material definition change to the term “security” in the U.S. is unlikely (and maybe not desirable). By stripping out a characteristic that would make something less like a security, we are left with an asset that’s unlikely to have value.      Instead, we should be shouting: “Securities are great. The definition encompasses vehicles like stock, funds, bonds and partnership shares which have built our global economy for hundreds of years. We don’t want to avoid securities, we want to have more of them and we want to make them easier to issue and manage.”      There are many technical and regulatory things we can do to improve how securities are issued and move, including beefing up the Reg CF exemption or adding another exemption for non-accredited investors, loosening ongoing reporting requirements for smaller public companies not traded on exchanges, reducing the burdens of anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements and other regulatory strategies could help.      On the technical side, there many projects promising robust potential improvements in the way securities move. These include smart contracts, asset tagging and other tools developed around ethereum ERC 1400, 1404, Ravencoin tagging and restricted assets, the Polymath/Polymesh project, Liquid and RSK on bitcoin; all offer or plan to offer. In an ideal situation, securities will move similarly to digital bearer assets like monero (XMR) or bitcoin but with embedded, attached or second layer tools to cover identity and compliance needs.      There are many ways to improve securities but core to all efforts should be the recognition that securities' status is not something to be avoided but to be embraced. It is one of the most important and beneficial inventions in economic history.

Swiss crypto product provider 21Shares, formerly known as Amun, said Tuesday its new ""SBTC"" tracker product would be available to both institutional and retail investors on Boerse Stuttgart, the second-largest stock exchange in Germany.      21Shares Managing Director Laurent Kssis told CoinDesk this would be the first inverse bitcoin tracker tradable in euros, making it accessible to a much wider variety of investors, retail and institutional, based across the European Union.      Most trackers are currently listed in U.S. dollars, which comes with ""high hand grenade fees"" for European traders, according to Kssis. The new Boerse Stuttgart listing means retail investors are no longer ""lumbered with fees and some pretty wide FX rates"" from their brokerages, he said.      Fully hedged against the underlying bitcoin (BTC) at a 1:1 ratio, 21Shares launched its SBTC tracker on the Swiss stock exchange (SIX) in January. The tracker moves inversely to the BTC spot price: Should the bitcoin price fall by $100, the SBTC tracker will increase by the corresponding amount.      21Shares CEO Hany Rashwan told CoinDesk at the time the product made bitcoin shorting simpler. Rather than taking out a capital loan or taking a risk on trying to sell at the right time, investors purchase SBTC as they do a stock without incurring interest payments.      SBTC positions reset at the end of each day, meaning performances do not roll over from one day to the next. Investors are liable to pay a management fee for every day they hold the tracker.      ""The German market has been very vocal about being able to buy cryptocurrencies as well as going short and having some sort of protection,"" explained Kssis. ""For those who want to have some sort of protection, this is a great way to cover their long position.""      Listing on Boerse Stuttgart has ""fast-tracked"" the SBTC tracker, making it available for purchase on most Europe-based online brokerage platforms, Kssis said. He added that 21Shares has now filed a prospectus with the Swedish authorities to have it listed there, too.      The firm reached industry-wide attention when, as Amun, it released its bitcoin ETP product on the Swiss SIX Exchange in October 2018. Since then the company has expanded its offering to include products tracking many other large-cap cryptocurrencies, as well as coin bundles giving investors exposure to selected market segments.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/25/short-bitcoin-etp-available-to-investors-on-germanys-second-largest-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd00601c6ffe000299f0ab44bfbf1bf8a9f8d3ce-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""Chainlink is set to become the first and primary oracle provider for all Substrate-based chains and eventually the entire Polkadot network,"" Polkadot announced Monday. Chainlink provides price feeds for blockchain applications typically involved in decentralized finance (DeFi).      Among other things, Chainlink communicates prices between crypto networks. Unlike traditional equities markets, cryptocurrencies can be sold by anyone. As would be expected, finding a true market price across disparate bazaars can be difficult. In an interview, Chainlink CEO Sergey Nazarov said the firm’s oracles source pricing data from multiple sources – both on- and off-chain – to come within 1 percent of a true market price.      Launched in 2016, Polkadot was created by ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood. Wood's Parity Technologies, has over 100 developers building infrastructure for the Polkadot project, according to Parity Head of Public Affairs Peter Mauric.      Polkadot is a network for connecting and launching blockchain applications, with its “parachain” technology acting as a bridge between different blockchains.      Until Polkadot launches, Chainlink’s pricing feeds will first service Polkadot’s experimental Kusama network. However, the parachain between Chainlink’s decentralized pricing oracles and Kusama remains under construction, Polkadot said. The partnership started with Chainlink integrating with an unnamed Substrate-based blockchain.      ""The integration of Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network on a dedicated parachain can unlock multiple use cases on Polkadot,"" Polkadot wrote in a blog post announcing the deal.

Each FTX_Equity token, valued at $2 each, represents an ownership stake in the FTX Trading Ltd., the holding company that owns the derivatives exchange. Investors will be able to purchase the tokens directly through an exchange account with U.S. dollars, bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) or FTX's native FTT token.      Although token holders receive dividend payouts into their exchange accounts, they will not have any voting rights and will not be named individually on the shareholder registry. Investors can convert FTX_Equity into conventional FTX equity, but only in batches of 1.25 million tokens.      It isn't clear what the exchange rate is between normal and tokenized FTX equity. Although FTX will not accept investment from residents of the U.S. and some other jurisdictions, there appear to be no restrictions preventing retail investors from participating in the sale.      An FTX spokesperson told CoinDesk the equity tokens had not been created ""just yet.""      The sale is expected to close March 7.      Launching in May 2019, FTX offers futures, options and perpetual contracts on approximately 30 different digital assets. It raised $8 million in a private equity round in August 2019.      At the time Binance acquired a minority stake in December, the exchange processed approximately $170 million in average monthly volume on its bitcoin and ether futures. That has since increased to nearly $355 million in February, according to data analytics site Skew.

Although the number of tokens up for sale has not been disclosed, the token equity sale will take FTX's value into line with its billion-dollar equity valuation, the exchange said.

42383339,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vHUt,1582634461,New Zealand Plans to Drop 'Unfavorable' Sales Tax Treatment of Cryptocurrencies,"New Zealand's tax authority is considering changes to its treatment of cryptocurrencies that would drop the current and controversial application of goods and services tax (GST).      The current regime sees bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies as property, with normal rules applying. That means crypto is liable for 15 percent GST when changing hands within the country as part of a business's operations and potentially throws up a ""double taxation"" problem when income tax is later applied.      Calling the situation ""unfavorable,"" the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department (IRD) has now suggested doing away with the GST liability for cryptocurrencies in many cases, but keeping the treatment for income tax.      In a policy issues paper made public on Monday, the IRD states:    ""Because of their innovative nature, [cryptocurrencies] will often also have different features to ... other investment products. This means that some existing tax rules can be difficult to apply, involve very high compliance costs or may provide policy outcomes for some crypto-assets that lead to over-taxation compared to other alternative investment products.""    The overall aim of any changes would be that cryptocurrencies should have a similar treatment to other investment products or asset classes that are ""close substitutes"" for the digital asset.      An issue being considered by the IRD is whether different types of tokens should have different tax treatments depending on how they are used. One way forward is that tokens used like currency or shares would likely not be liable to GST while other types might see the sales tax applied.      ""An advantage of this approach is that it should provide a neutral tax treatment for those crypto-assets which are close substitutes for existing financial products such as currency or shares,"" the IRD says.      The tax department suggests it might still treat some tokens differently; for instance, if a token is considered to be a share ""but if it does not provide an interest in a foreign company or partnership, it would still be taxed very differently to other foreign equity investments.""      Yet, with thousands of tokens now available offering different use cases and features, the IRD says there may be ""practical limitations"" to their potential classification for tax purposes.      As such, a different approach being considered is to usher in more general changes to tax rules that are seen as throwing up ""the most significant policy issues when applied to crypto-assets.""      ""There appears to be a case to exclude most types of crypto-asset from the GST and financial arrangement rules by developing a broad definition of crypto-assets for this purpose,"" says the IRD.      Whatever the solution, Inland Revenue recognizes change is needed. The department says, ""The current GST rules provide an uncertain and variable GST treatment making, using or investing in crypto-assets less attractive than using money or investing in other financial assets.""      Parties with an interest in the issue have until April 9 to offer their opinions on the best solution.      Australia, which had previously also imposed GST on some crypto transactions, ended the policy in October 2017. Singapore proposed the same policy change last summer.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/25/new-zealand-plans-to-drop-unfavorable-sales-tax-treatment-of-cryptocurrencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65fdbdedd1ff8620aa683e46f53d4a9a38e77706-1500x997.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383350,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vHij,1582629680,Bitcoin Faces Further Losses if Bulls Can't Disrupt Bearish Chart Pattern,"View  Bitcoin has formed a bearish head-and-shoulders (H+S) pattern with neckline support at $9,400.  An H+S breakdown would imply a short-term bearish reversal and expose deeper support near $9,070.  A move above $10,128 is needed to revive the immediate bullish setup.    Bitcoin (BTC) is down but not out, with prices holding above key support near $9,400. However, if that level is breached, more chart-driven selling may be on the cards.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading around $9,560, representing a nearly 2 percent drop on the day, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Prices fell from $10,000 to $9,500 on Monday, engulfing the preceding day’s price gain. The drop came as stocks collapsed and classic safe-haven assets rallied on the coronavirus scare. Notably, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by over 1,000 points, while gold rose to $1,676 per ounce – the highest level since February 2013.      With bitcoin failing to post gains during the risk-off tone in the financial markets, the popular narrative that the cryptocurrency is a haven asset has weakened. Prices rallied by 30 percent last month amid the U.S.-Iran tensions and the coronavirus outbreak in China, convincing the analyst community of its strengthening safe-haven appeal.      With Monday’s drop, bitcoin has also formed a head-and-shoulders pattern on technical charts, as seen below.    12-hour chart    The head-and-shoulders pattern is a sign of a bearish reversal. A drop below the neckline support marks a transition from a bullish higher-lows, higher-highs setup to bearish lower highs and lower lows.      At press time, the neckline support is seen at $9,400. Acceptance under that level would confirm a breakdown and create room for a deeper decline to $8,300 (target as per the measured move method).      Seasoned traders would argue a head-and-shoulders breakdown often traps sellers on the wrong side of the market. While that can be true, its effects depend on context. If the pattern appears following a notable price rally or at multi-month highs, as is the case here, the breakdown tends to cause more sellers to join the market, keeping prices low.      That said, a post-breakdown sell-off, if any, could be cut short near the crucial support levels lined up at $9,188 – bitcoin had turned lower from that level on Jan. 19 – and the higher low of $9,075 created on Feb. 4.    1-hour chart    Sellers failed to keep prices below $9,500 during the early European trading hours. Moreover, dips below that level have been consistently short-lived since Feb. 19.      If that level continues to restrict losses during the U.S. hours, some buying pressure may emerge to lift prices back to $9,750-$9,800. The outlook, however, would turn bullish only if prices rise above $10,128, as discussed Monday.

The platform is now launched for testing alongside a handful of Nornickel’s partners including commodity trading company Trafigura, metal refinery firm Umicore and supply chain consultancy Traxys, according to an announcement Tuesday. (All three have been involved in early-stage trials with Nornickel since December, Bloomberg reported at the time.)      Later, a wider circle of institutional players will have access to the distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform, according to Atomyze. It's expected to serve the companies from Switzerland and the U.S., as Nornickel CEO Vladimir Potanin told Bloomberg Tuesday morning.      Users in Russia might also be able to access Atomyze by the year's end, but only if long-in-the-works regulations clarifying the status of digital assets have been passed by that time.      The first batch of tokens will be backed by palladium, cobalt and copper mined by Nornickel. Over the first year, Nornickel expects to tokenize up to 10 percent of its overall sales volume – a number that may rise to 20 percent in the future, the firm said.      Umicore and Traxys didn't respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comments by press time. However, a Trafigura spokesperson said the company is “in advanced discussions to participate” in Atomyze and “is looking forward to taking an active part in the testing phase of the platform.”      Atomyze was created by Tokentrust, a Swiss entity led by CEO Marco Grossi, a former director of Deloitte Switzerland. Tokentrust's board includes Alexander Stoyanov, the managing director of Nornickel’s subsidiary Global Palladium Fund.      IBM was also involved, acting as the project's lead technology partner. Big Blue ""participated in the development of the platform and in the integration of the advanced BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerant) consensus mechanism, which allows implementing a system with an open governance model when using the Hyperledger Fabric framework,"" a company representative said.      Atomyze is further applying for a securities license in Switzerland that would allow it to operate an organized trading facility (OTF), Grossi said through a spokesperson.      Atomyze is “in discussion with large institutional and professional organizations from various industries who are envisaged to participate in our DLT network by running independent nodes to ensure the right level of decentralization,” the spokesperson said.      The network will run in IBM's public cloud and comply with the European privacy protection law known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and a security regulation called Cloud Computing Compliance Controls Catalog (C5), Atomyze said.      Nornickel has been working on tokenizing its metals for a while, aiming to turn them into more liquid assets and make the sales process easier and more flexible, Nornickel CEO Vladimir Potanin said in October.      The company joined the Hyperledger enterprise DLT consortium last summer. Nornickel has been testing the solution inside a regulatory sandbox set up by Russia’s central bank.

42383331,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vHM5,1582617600,Singapore’s Court of Appeals Rules Against Quoine Exchange in Landmark Crypto Case,"Singapore's Court of Appeals has ruled against digital currency exchange Quoine in a landmark case relating to a breach of contract when the platform unlawfully reversed seven trades.      The Straits Times reported the case marks the first of its kind in the country involving a cryptocurrency dispute. The ruling concludes a legal battle that began almost three years ago.      Quoine, the parent company of Japanese trading platform Liquid, now faces settlement proceedings after the court rejected its appeal over the claim it had the right to cancel orders placed by market maker B2C2 on its platform based on the premise those transactions were a “mistake.”      Quoine had argued the parties who interacted with B2C2’s trading software were acting under the false pretense the trades were at fair market value and B2C2 knew the trades were incorrectly priced.      In April 2017, B2C2 had placed seven trades in which it sold ether (ETH) at an exchange rate of 10 bitcoin (BTC) each, approximately 250 times higher than the market rate of about 0.04 BTC to 1 ETH at the time, according to court documents.      The appeal court's reasoning focused on the question of how the legal doctrine of ""mistake"" should be applied when contracts were drawn up and executed by computer systems with limited human involvement.      A day after the trades took place, where 309 ETH were exchanged for 3,092 BTC ($12 million at the time), Quoine noticed the abnormality and reset B2C2’s balances to their state before the seven trades, which prompted the lawsuit.      The Singapore International Commercial Court ruled in March 2019 that Quoine was liable for the “breach of contract and breach of trust” in reversing B2C2’s trades. Subsequently, the exchange filed for an appeal.      However, four of the five judges presiding on the appeal panel dismissed Quione’s argument, saying it is the programmer's state of knowledge that is relevant in the context of digital agreements between a computer system and a participant on the platform.      The court said there was no mistake in the terms of the trading contract and, even if there was a flaw, B2C2's trading software was not aware of it when executing the orders, according to the report.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/25/singapores-court-of-appeals-rules-against-quoine-exchange-in-landmark-crypto-case,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc5064b88aba0e1fa170fa422fe1bdd1ef79fe8b-1500x1029.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383347,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vHhT,1582606800,"Lightning Solves Bitcoin's Speed Problem, but Watch Out for Fraudsters","J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.      I don't know about you, but the thing that got me interested in bitcoin (BTC) was its potential to become a popular way to make payments and remittances. Over the years we've been constantly disappointed on this front. Bitcoin payments just never caught on with the masses. Meanwhile, usage of fiat-based person-to-person payment tools like Venmo, Square Cash, Zelle and the U.K.'s Faster Payments has exploded.      Bitcoin's new lightning layer has rekindled the dream of bitcoin-as-generally-accepted medium of exchange. But lightning is prickly to use. Which is why Zap’s recent announcement of Strike, a new lightning application, caught my interest. Strike aims to popularize bitcoin payments by making lightning more user-friendly.      The idea behind Strike is to create a fiat-based payments app, say like Venmo, except under the hood the payment is conducted in bitcoin. A hybrid fiat-bitcoin payments app is a neat idea. But marrying fiat with bitcoin will involve challenges, too.      A bitcoin payment is special. The bitcoin network is open to everyone, or censorship resistant. It allows for pseudonymous usage. And it provides what Satoshi Nakamoto described as non-reversible digital transfers; like cash, once the stuff is spent, the economic relationship between payer and payee is severed.    Without even knowing it, you've paid your neighbor with bitcoin.    Pseudonymity, non-reversibility and openness will cause hassles that regular payments platforms like Square Cash or Venmo needn’t worry about. It remains to be seen whether hybrid fiat-bitcoin platforms like Strike will be able to marry the two systems in a form that still attracts a mainstream user base.      Let's back up a bit. How does lightning resuscitate the dream of mainstream bitcoin payments? Writing a transaction to bitcoin's core blockchain takes time. It has to be broadcast to the network and confirmed by miners. On top of that, a processing fee must be paid. This fee can get particularly costly when everyone wants to use the bitcoin network at the same time.      These delays and fees put off mainstream users. By routing around the blockchain, lightning can help regular people be more comfortable making bitcoin payments.    Roller-coaster problem    Unfortunately, lightning doesn't solve bitcoin’s roller-coaster problem. After experiencing bitcoin's crazy price rises and dips, a new user will never want to hold bitcoin again. Or they will be so excited by the ride that they treat it as a betting game. Either way, they won't use it for payments.      Strike, founded by a smart and affable Jack Mallers, tries to solve the roller-coaster problem by letting people load funds onto an app, much like they do with Venmo. But when they make a payment, unbeknown to them, Strike (which is still in beta) will route the payment to the recipient via lightning.      Say you’d like to buy an antique vase for $100 at your neighbor’s garage sale. You don't have any cash on hand. But you do have your credit card. Needless to say, your neighbor doesn’t have a card terminal set up. But she does have a lightning channel open. Strike allows the two of you to connect. The $100 flows from your bank account to Strike’s bank account, upon which Strike sends 0.01 bitcoins to your neighbor via lightning.      That’s it. Without even knowing it, you've paid your neighbor with bitcoin. No volatility. And no need to learn how to use a strange new payments network. The entire experience simply piggybacks off of your existing knowledge of how to use a debit card.      As for your neighbor, with just a lightning address, she can immediately accept non-reversible payments from debit card holders all over the world. That's neat.      But unless your neighbor has the technical chops, setting up lightning won't be easy, certainly not as easy as accepting fiat-based payments via Zelle or Venmo. Which means that hybrid fiat-bitcoin payments systems will probably have to reach nooks and crannies that are as-yet unserved by the Zelles and Venmos of the world.      While marijuana is legal in many U.S. states, it is illegal on the federal level. And so banks often disconnect companies that process marijuana payments for fear of losing access to Federal Deposit Insurance, or the Federal Reserve's settlement system. As a result, many marijuana businesses are forced to turn card-paying customers away.      In a recent blog post, Mallers described how his family's marijuana store set up a lightning channel, then encouraged debit card-carrying customers to download Strike. Now the store could reconnect to its clients with cards. That's pretty useful.      Many parts of the world, including Nigeria, are locked out of the U.S. person-to-person payments economy. Venmo and Zelle don't allow non-U.S. citizens to sign up. As a matter of policy, PayPal doesn't allow Nigerians to receive money (although they can open an account). If a Nigerian were to advertise a lightning payments channel, however, a hybrid fiat-to-bitcoin system like Strike could connect that person to Americans who want to do fiat-based person-to-person payments. The sender needn't know anything about bitcoin or lightning.      Now for some of the complications of marrying fiat to bitcoin.    Operators of hybrid systems will have to fund buyer identity fraud out of their own pocket.    One of the problems that person-to-person payments apps like Venmo must deal with is buyer identity fraud. Scammers will often hack Venmo accounts or fund them with stolen credit cards. Then they use the funds to buy expensive goods. Sellers never realize they've accepted stolen money until Venmo reverses the payment.      Since a hybrid system like Strike connects to lightning addresses, recouping stolen funds from recipients won't be possible. Once a lightning payment is made, it's irreversible. Which means operators of hybrid systems will have to fund buyer identity fraud out of their own pocket. That could get quite expensive.      Another type of fraud is authorized push fraud. This sort of fraud occurs when a scammer tricks victims into sending money for, say, concert tickets, but never actually provides the tickets and makes off with the money.      Payments options like the U.K.'s Faster Payments, Venmo and Square Cash are rife with push fraud. But they do have tools for combating it, including quickly canceling offending accounts and tightening up the rules for opening accounts. Faster Payments is introducing a new account name checking service to cut down on fraud.      But a hybrid fiat-to-bitcoin system that connects to pseudonymous lightning addresses can't use tools like identity checking or account cancellation to combat authorized push fraud. The whole idea behind bitcoin is to prevent this very sort of censorship.      And so hybrid systems could become popular with fraudsters. A popular scam these days is to ask Granny to get out of her rocking chair, go to Walmart and buy four $500 Google Play cards. With a hybrid fiat-bitcoin system, scammers can extort her by having her send $5,000 via her debit card, all from the comfort of her chair. The lightning side of the transaction allows the bad guys to stay anonymous and untouchable.      The problem with fraud is that if it gets out of control, it stigmatizes a payments system. This, in turn, harms the brand, impedes broader usage and may even attract political pushback. Douglas Jackson, the founder of the pseudonymous e-Gold payment system, serves as a good example. According to Jackson, e-gold’s failure to ever become more than a marginal player can be blamed on ""self-reinforcing negative reputation"" created by criminal abuse. (Indeed, it eventually led to e-gold being shut down.)      To cut down on buyer identity fraud and authorized push fraud, a hybrid fiat-to-bitcoin system might decide to throw in the towel and do what Venmo and the others do: vet all users. But then it would no longer be doing censorship-resistant money. Gone would be non-reversible transactions. After all, the operator of the payment system could pressure lightning address owners to reverse payments on pain of being taken off of it the operator’s white list.      Strike highlights many of the contradictions involved in developing bitcoin solutions. Lightning is complicated. This prevents regular folks from using it. But simplifying a lightning payment by marrying it to the fiat system introduces a new set of complications. Bringing censorship resistance and non-reversibility to a mainstream audience may be impossible.      Or maybe not. There’s a lot of creativity being brought to bear on this problem. Maybe folks like Mallers will find the sweet spot.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/25/lightning-solves-bitcoins-speed-problem-but-watch-out-for-fraudsters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90efe2b8edf1d49268f0cd708c65d7d26d77cf5c-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

They are the building blocks to efficient coordination, providing a consistent and reliable framework for people and organizations to be able to understand each other and work together.    You don’t give a second thought to any of that stuff. Because of standards.    Not surprisingly, an ex-SWIFT guy was one of the first to cotton on to this. Considered the gold standard for reliable and secure financial messaging, SWIFT is a worldwide network that enables banks and financial institutions to send and receive information about money transfers. Alexandre Kech spent 18 years working there, mostly in the standards department, building and managing ISO International Standards to be used by SWIFT member institutions.      Standards recently became very much a thing for crypto when a new set of rules recommended any registered entity in the business of moving crypto should have to comply with the same global standards against money laundering and terrorist financing as the rest of the traditional financial ecosystem. Intended to increase transparency over illicit activity, these new rules meant Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) such as exchanges would have to start sharing reciprocal data about the sender and receiver on either side of a crypto transaction. To make it work, they would also have to speak the same language. So the need for a global data standard suddenly became clear.      When SWIFT was established back in the 1970s, the real revolution was not the SWIFT network itself – it was the creation of a standard. Before then, there was no common language. No data or messaging rules. No automation. Just free text via the telex! Even currencies did not have a standard code like USD or GBP. It was an operational nightmare resulting in lost funds, legal disputes and very, very slow global trade processes. So, at the time, SWIFT’s new standard helped to streamline coordination efforts to achieve an unprecedented level of efficiency and interoperability. At least, for the institutions that implemented them.      This highlights some irony in the very notion of standardization. Standards only become standard when widely adopted. So how do you distill a rich melting pot of language, custom and culture down to a single global lexicon to be accepted and actioned by all? At some point, somewhere, things are bound to skew, thus enforcing the same type of segregation that we set out to solve.      “Most of the standards we use today have been defined by the western world and imposed on the Asia Pacific,” says Kech, the Belgian who was sent to Singapore in 2012, precisely to deploy standards across the region. He says the reasons behind this are fairly practical: When you’ve got these big, dominant standards bodies based in Europe – such as SWIFT in Belgium or ISO in Switzerland – there are significant language barriers for would-be Asian participants throughout the standards development process, which is generally carried out over a series of committee meetings between technical experts. Also, the timezone for these meetings is rarely convenient for those in Asia.      “So naturally, and technically, you end up with a standard that is more influenced by western views than it is global,” says Kech. “The situation often leads to Asia implementing protocols that don’t always completely fit their reality.”    The goal is not homogeneity, but inclusivity.    Kech crossed over to the “dark side” in December 2018, to become CEO of Onchain Custodian, an automated platform for safekeeping and managing institutional digital asset investments. We caught up in Manila, Philippines, after he chaired a forum at the Asian Development Bank about improving interoperability for traditional financial markets across Asia. The tone of the forum was one of frustration, even exhaustion. The central bankers, finance ministers and regulators lamented over decades spent trying to standardize cross-border data flows between a mishmash of domestic regulations and practices.      Later, over Xiao Long Bao and a few Tsingtaos, Kech told me that “we better move our ass” if we [the crypto industry] don't want to end up the same way. The goal is not homogeneity but inclusivity. Global standards should be flexible enough to be implemented at a local level and still respect nuance. We need to create something more versatile than that of our financial ancestry, but the way we are building – too often in silos – is putting the ecosystem in danger of ending up fragmented, western-centric and still struggling with interoperability.      Kech references a joint working group as a good example of how it should be done. Known as the Joint Working Group on interVASP Messaging Standards, the group is convened by an ex-regulator, Siân Jones of XReg Consulting, and was established by three international blockchain industry bodies: the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC), Global Digital Finance (GDF) and the International Digital Asset Exchange Association (IDAXA).      They kicked off in December 2019 with the goal of developing a universal common language for messaging between VASPs. The technical experts (Kech being one of them) meet weekly by teleconference on a rotating roster (so at some point, everyone draws a short straw on the timing of the call) and some of the most vocal participants in the 100-strong group are from Asia – including Hong Kong, Singapore and the Philippines.      By May of this year, interVASP aims to turn out a new standard called IVMS101, ready for industry adoption. By comparison, it usually takes two years to get a standard approved by ISO.      This is a reminder of how quickly crypto moves, and also how early-stage this industry is. We have relatively few players to coordinate, no legacy systems or structures holding us back and technology is part of our DNA. In designing these systems today, we need to think about how they will be used in the future. Standards are the seeds of interoperability and this is our chance to do it right.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Leah Callon-Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/25/crypto-exchanges-need-common-messaging-to-comply-with-travel-rule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0d2077ca121afe971fbb363a69390a4740bf545d-1200x825.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383346,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vHgD,1582592400,CoolBitX Raises $16.7M to Make Crypto More Bank-Friendly,"Asian companies are accelerating the crypto industry’s push to make exchanges work more like traditional banks.      The crypto wallet and security startup CoolBitX raised $16.7 million in a round led by Japanese financial group SBI Holdings, with participation from the National Development Fund of Taiwan, Korean crypto exchange BitSonic and Japanese financial firm Monex. In 2020, the startup’s focus is on new products and features that comply with new rules from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) that require businesses to collect and pass information about customers when transferring funds between firms.      Several Asian countries, including Singapore, South Korea and Japan, swiftly responded to the token boom of 2017 with regulatory proposals and enforcement. As such, crypto companies in these regions must follow strict anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. CoolBitX CEO Michael Ou argued in a 2019 column that many countries in the region now have a more mature crypto industry than North America’s.      “We believed it was necessary to be ahead of the regulatory curve and have a solution in place in anticipation of stricter AML regulations from the South Korean government,” said BitSonic CEO Jinwook Shin. “In the coming months, the South Korean government is expected to pass regulations that will change the country’s cryptocurrency landscape and this investment [in CoolBitX] allows us to be on top of these regulations.”      Underscoring that same point about professional exchange guidelines, Monex Group CEO Oki Matsumoto said in a press statement that as a cryptocurrency exchange owner he sees “huge potential in CoolBitX” to promote the “proper adoption of virtual assets” in a fair yet robust industry.  “We continue to closely monitor regulatory developments around the world in order to roll out each product or service to as broad a market as possible,” said CoolBitX international manager Elsa Madrolle, an alum of derivatives exchange CME Group. “Our plans are ultimately to expand globally.”      Madrolle added she expects cryptocurrency exchanges to soon have experiences that “resemble how people transfer money electronically using a digital bank.” Shin added his exchange is working with CoolBitX to “demonstrate our commitment to compliance and willingness to work hand-in-hand with the government.”      If Asian markets offer a harbinger of industry norms, then future fiat on-ramps and cryptocurrency custody products will fall in line with digital banking norms. Madrolle said it’s too soon to know how such regulations will impact the startup’s hardware wallet, but she doesn’t expect future features to hinder or inconvenience retail users.      “FATF-compliant regulation should help draw attention to cryptocurrency as a valid asset class and create more comfort for bigger institutions to consider investing,” she said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/25/coolbitx-raises-167m-to-make-crypto-more-bank-friendly,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8d38f21920c04235ddbbef205fd3a5ba1d6eb45-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
