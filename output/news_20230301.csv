The projects will look at use cases ranging from offline payments to bond settlement to securities trading, among others, the Australian central bank announced on Thursday morning local time.  In a statement, RBA Assistant Governor Brad Jones said the participants in the pilot projects include a wide array of industry representatives, from “smaller fintechs to large financial institutions.”  “The pilot and broader research study that will be conducted in parallel will serve two ends – it will contribute to hands-on learning by industry, and it will add to policy makers’ understanding of how a CBDC could potentially benefit the Australian financial system and economy,” he said.  Australia’s central bank is looking to complete its central bank digital currency pilot – which kicked off last August – by mid-2023.  The RBA’s partners for the pilot projects include the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ), Mastercard, Monoova, the Australian Bond Exchange, DigiCash, Commonwealth Bank and others.  Some of these projects will address issues like conducting offline transactions using a CBDC. A project description suggests smart cards preloaded with funds could enable offline payments, though it will focus on a “consumer-to-merchant” scenario.  Another project will look at using the dollar-pegged USDC stablecoin to streamline foreign exchange trades and remittances. The project will test whether international remittances can be 24/7/365 while reducing counterparty risk.  The RBA’s digital dollar experiment is one of many such initiatives by central banks around the world. A CBDC not only represents the transition to a more digital economy, but also a safer alternative to private cryptocurrencies that may even leverage their underlying technologies.

42393859,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brQys7,1677709890,"Bitcoin, Ether Settle Into a Range as Indicators Point Neutral","Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) appear poised to continue trading in their current narrow ranges as many indicators flash neutral.  The two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap have seen volatilities lessen over the past seven days while momentum for both has fallen during the past 14 days.  The breather for both assets is unsurprising given their 43% and 38% year-to-date price increases. Those gains seemed outsized given the brewing uncertainties about crypto regulation, inflation and the economy.  BTC’s sharp rise to start the year followed a three-month period of flat trading activity.  Some crypto market observers may positively view the lack of profit taking following such a move higher. Currently, BTC and ETH are trading tightly to their 20-day moving averages, a price level that has demonstrated significant agreement between buyers and sellers in the past.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI), often used as a proxy to measure momentum, has fallen 20% since Feb. 15 to 55 for BTC. Ether’s RSI fell 12.5% to 54 over the same time period.  RSI is an indicator that ranges between 0-100, with a reading of 30 signaling that an asset may be oversold, and a reading over 70 indicating that it may be overbought. RSI readings near 50 indicate neither, and suggest that markets see both assets as fairly priced.  The cocktail of decreasing volatility, neutral momentum and significant price agreement could result in BTC and ETH trading in a relatively flat range, in lieu of a new catalyst.  Meanwhile, the Fear and Greed index for bitcoin sits exactly at a perfectly neutral 50 on a scale of 0-100.  On-chain analytics are painting a similar picture. Bitcoin’s Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio is currently 43.4, essentially identical to its six-month NVT ratio of 43.26. ETH’s NVT ratio is 108, an 6% premium to its six-month average of 101.75.  The NVT ratio is a valuation metric used in crypto markets and can be likened to the Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio in traditional finance. When an asset’s NVT falls below average, it indicates the asset is undervalued. Higher NVT levels indicate the opposite.  All told, crypto markets appear to be in a holding pattern, and a significant bullish catalyst is not currently appearing on the horizon. Crypto holders have been reluctant to take profits following the move higher. The result is an asset that has plateaued while looking for the next directional signal.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/01/bitcoin-ether-settle-into-a-range-as-indicators-point-neutral,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e9dbde5782fa99bb62a9eacc49af81577b4b3f3-4096x3072.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm was looking to secure fresh funding but has been unable to, making it the latest victim of the continuing crypto bear market, according to a person CoinDesk communicated with via direct messages. News of the layoffs was first reported on Twitter.  While “more than half” of Protego’s workforce has been laid off this week, the charter is still very much in play, the person told CoinDesk. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has been encouraging due to the emphasis Protego places on security and compliance and the investments made there, the person added.  “Dozens of folks are still involved though not as employees, and some employees are still in place. Money is a problem, though there is a signed deal which has been very slow in funding,” said the source. “Operations, risk management, compliance, data centers/applications etc. are all sitting in a ready to launch state, but until capital comes, Protego is stuck.”  Protego did not respond to requests for comment.  Protego received conditional approval from the OCC, the independent wing of the Treasury Department that oversees the national banking industry, to convert into a nationally chartered trust bank in early 2021.

THALES is a standard ERC-20 token that grants governance rights over the Thales decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to users who stake the token. Some 20,000 THALES tokens will be distributed proportionally every week to users who stake THALES on Arbitrum, according to a Thales blog post. Each staker can acquire an additional 50% of their staking rewards as a bonus, depending on the user’s activity across the protocol.  Already deployed on Optimism, Polygon and BNB Chain, the Thales expansion of its staking approach to Arbitrum is not only intended to make ThalesDAO governance more resilient by having governance voters or THALES stakers on several chains, but it also encourages protocol usage.  The Thales treasury will seed $100,000 in protocol-owned liquidity for the THALES/ETH pool on Camelot, a rising decentralized exchange on Arbitrum. Camelot decided to match THALES rewards with GRAIL, Camelot’s native token, allowing users to earn dual liquidity mining rewards on their THALES/ETH positions. Farming rewards in the form of GRAIL and THALES went live today.  According to Thales’ technical documents, a parimutuel market is defined as one where “collateral is placed in a single shared pool, and that pool is awarded to winning participants after a market-settling event has occurred.” The payoff is determined by the total pool minus the protocol fee shared across all winning positions.  A glance at the Thales-built Overtime platform shows a variety of ""spot markets"" in sports from European football to MMA.  Thales parimutuel markets’ on-chain data feeds mostly come from Chainlink, and “are used as immutable sources of truth for market settlement,” as said in Thales’ whitepaper.  The protocol reached an aggregated volume of nearly $21.87 million among all its products built, according to an analytics dashboard generated by pseudonymous Dune wizard, Leifu.  Increasing almost 5% since Monday, the price of THALES currently sits at $0.59, making its market capitalization stand at $21 million, per CoinGecko.",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | ARB | BNB,Sage D.

From showing promise to empty promises  More Than Gamers (MTG) brought together prominent YouTube personalities, streamers and esports leaders to build out its ambitious vision: Aaron Kirshenberg, founder and CEO esports league Team New Age (TNA); esports manager and co-founder Nicholas Amos, head of marketing Michael Padilla, aka The Fortnite Guy; 3D animated visual artist Aalasady Al-Shureiji, aka Ali; and design lead Jacob Honeycutt, aka 3seater. Kirshenberg later brought on Mat Sposta, founder of NFT collective Chibi Labs, as an advisor in early 2022 to help him build out the MTG universe after its NFT mint.  “I saw the opportunity to create a community in the Web3 space that's centered around actual gamers,” Kirshenberg told CoinDesk.  To kick things off, the team created a 10,000-edition NFT profile picture (PFP) collection made up of a series of 3D characters that, as the project states, would be “​​fighting for survival in the Gamers Metaverse.”  On Dec. 23, 2021, MTG opened the mint for the first 7,000 NFTs in its collection. Listed for 0.2 ETH (about $822 at the time), the collection sold out in seconds and netted roughly $5.7 million in initial sales. The remaining 3,000 tokens were listed the next day, raising the total profits of the mint to around 8.2 million.  The project quickly gained traction among collectors and gamers, leading to booming sales on the secondary market. In its early days, the project boasted that one of its rare “Legendary Gamer” NFTs sold for 27.5 ETH, which was about $102,500 at the time.  MTG’s early success attracted an undisclosed amount of seed funding from metaverse investment group QGlobe, a firm known for helping Web3 companies facilitate initial-game offerings (IGO), which are methods to crowdsource funding for play-to-earn games through native tokens or digital asset sales.  QGlobe co-founder Sarah Austin told CoinDesk in December 2021 that it planned to build an MTG metaverse ecosystem that could rival top platforms like Decentraland or The Sandbox. On its website, QGlobe previously teased “MASSIVE MTG online tournaments with hundreds of thousands if not millions of viewers.”  Post-mint, the collection collaborated with buzzy projects such as Hype Bears Club, FishyFam and Awesome Apes, to cross-promote allowlist spots. It even worked with professional Fortnite player Daniel Keem, aka Keemstar, on a MTG PFP and token holder-only tournament.  MTG continued to build momentum by publishing an ambitious project road map in March 2022 that outlined plans for its expansive gaming ecosystem – pledging to build a “metaverse environment for gamers” and drop a “cutting-edge MTG game” in the third or fourth quarter of 2022. It also teased the release of a native token, ARCADA, which users could earn by staking their NFTs. Ahead of the game launch MTG said it would pin down plans for an in-game offering (IGO) to expand its asset offering.  Its road map also included plans for broader partnerships with major brands, including sportswear giant Champion, which would offer exclusive merchandise and wearables on the MTG platform (a tweet about the partnership has since been deleted). In-person meetups, conferences and even (somewhat strangely) a full rebrand were woven into the project’s future plans.  But despite its impressive NFT launch and laudable goals, the project has not delivered on many of its early promises that initially enticed professional gamers. In just over a year, the project has managed to deliver smaller offerings, like a merch store, a mini-game and a tournament with a $60,000 prize pool – but its highly anticipated ARCADA token never materialized, its brand partnerships have seemingly dissolved and its groundbreaking Web3 gaming ecosystem remains as elusive as ever.  To make matters worse, all of the original founding members have recently stepped away from leading the project, leaving community members that poured in thousands of dollars blindsided and with a slew of undelivered promises.  “The road map changed more times than I can count,” said an MTG token holder and active community member who asked to be referred to as Steven. “Partnerships never materialized, and deliverables didn’t come close to the marketed game.”  Early road map glitches  The founding team behind More Than Gamers were experts in building hype. Ahead of the NFT collection’s release, the MTG team was strategic about advertising the project with flashy promotional videos across multiple accounts.  Despite its successful marketing efforts and affiliations with influential figures, early signs that the project was struggling began to crop up.  Around two months after their mint, MTG posted on Twitter that TFG had agreed to step down from the project, raising questions about the overall direction of the project.  “This left the community in utter shambles, with no owner to trust, so many conflicting stories and still no delivering on the promised collaborations,” Ben, a mononymous MTG community member, told CoinDesk. Ben lent CoinDesk one of his MTG NFTs during the course of this story to verify his membership and allow CoinDesk access to NFT-restricted areas of the MTG Discord.  Investors were also warned of potential red flags early on. In QGlobe’s early days working with MTG, sources approached Austin with information about a previous project that Kirsheberg’s esports league TNA promoted called Sushiverse that employed similar tactics to MTG and faced an early demise.  This did not initially deter QGlobe, which wrote in a blog post in May 2022 that it would facilitate MTG’s in-game offering to allow users to make in-game asset purchases.  To appease restless holders waiting for the full MTG gaming ecosystem, MTG teased a mini-game to its holders in May as a precursor to the larger play-to-earn game meant to be released later in the year.  Steven told CoinDesk that holders were not impressed with the mini-game offering, which felt like a haphazard attempt by the project’s founders to deliver value to anxious community members.  “It felt like my uncle’s stories about Atari and the first Nintendo,” said Steven. “The mini-game wasn’t on the initial road map and this felt like disaster management with the team trying to deliver something, anything.”  Soon after, MTG posted a Twitter thread in response to the criticism, clarifying the game's intention to drive value to holders of its (still unlaunched) ARCADA token, while pointing a finger at those who criticized it.  “The reality is that this space is ruthless and critics will do what they can to put you down. We are going to continue building, as promised, and delivering value back to the MTG ecosystem,” MTG said in a tweet.  It was around this time that NFT holders began expressing confusion on Discord and Twitter about the overall state of the project and many of the long-term promises that remained confined to the road map. Delays plagued the release of the mini-game, and the $100,000 prize pool for the tournament for the mini-game was eventually reduced to $60,000.  The mini-game officially launched on Nov. 7, 2022, and remained open until Jan. 2, 2023, though many in the community were disappointed with the finished product. Ben told CoinDesk the game was a “slap in the face,” and that it had many loopholes for players to cheat, rack up funds and promptly depart the community with their loot.  Even bigger issues arose around the project’s ARCADA token launch. In February 2022, MTG released an NFT staking feature so holders could earn ARCADA. Staking, the project said, would allow games to earn ARCADA pre-launch, a token that according to the MTG website, would be used for in-game purchases and determine a player’s “society class” within the ecosystem.  By March, holders had apparently staked over 50% of all MTG NFTs to earn a still-uncreated token. The goal was to create a liquidity pool for users to earn rewards on their token.  Based on MTG’s road map, users believed the ARCADA token would launch and have real monetary value – which it has yet to provide. Kirshenberg told CoinDesk investment firm Wolfco Capital would work on this token with MTG, but that the partnership with Wolfco Capital ultimately fell through, and the liquidity pool never came to fruition.  Mickael Salabi, a Web3 investor and former advisor to Wolfco Capital, told CoinDesk the company shut down in April 2022, shortly after he was brought on. He noted that he is not familiar with MTG, and never met nor interacted with Kirshenberg. Other names associated with Wolfco Capital did not respond to CoinDesk for comment.  Leadership goes AFK  Beyond dissatisfied holders, tension was brewing among the MTG team and its investors. On Dec. 10, 2022, Kirshenberg claimed on Discord that the project had terminated its partnership with QGlobe due to “promises that never came to fruition,” such as the highly anticipated IGO.  “We were blindsided by this news and [were] led to believe the IGO was going to happen for months,” said Kirshenberg in a Discord post. “We are discussing alternatives internally.”  While holders had been grumbling about the project’s stagnant growth for months, alarm bells began to sound in January 2023, when Kirshenberg surprised the MTG community on Discord by announcing he was handing off leadership of the project to two Discord moderators, whose internet pseudonyms are Richie and Nikster.  “The entire team feels as though they are best equipped to lead MTG moving forward and for the project to succeed,” said Kirshenberg. “Myself and Sposta will continue to passively advise the project.”  Along with new leadership came a major deviation from the ethos of the project that initially got gamers excited – the announcement of a pivot away from building a Web3 gaming ecosystem in favor of developing a Web2 mobile game.  “Revenue wouldn't be easy to extract from the current market, so we will extract it from where it makes sense, the Web2 space,” said Richie in a Discord post addressing the leadership change and strategy shift.  Nikster told CoinDesk he and Richie are actively seeking ways to skirt current market conditions to bring value to token holders and make MTG a unique gaming community.  “We will continue to have thoughtful conversations around the new game, as we hope to create a revenue stream to reward the holders who have been patiently waiting to extract value from MTG,” said Nikster.  Ben told CoinDesk the sudden strategy shift signaled the project’s impending demise.  “I was absolutely shocked. It was the nail in the coffin,” Ben told CoinDesk. “Whenever I would ask Kirshenberg about why things went wrong he would never take accountability, which bothered a lot of the community.”  For some gamers, MTG was their first dive into Web3 – Ben told CoinDesk that MTG was the first NFT he ever purchased.  “I saw everyone buying really cool pieces of art with utility,” said Ben. “I really wanted to be a part of a community that transformed Web3 and gaming, which is what the trailers and marketing pointed to.”  “I also joined due to the trailers and marketing that were used to depict their game, brand and plans,” said Steven. “In retrospect, the MTG deliverables disappointed the community and fell extremely short of their marketing and communication with the Discord community.”  Game over?  While some community members continue to hold on to hope the project will deliver on its promises, others have decided to cut their losses.  At the time of publishing, the project’s floor price on secondary marketplace OpenSea has fallen from a high of 0.6 ETH (roughly $2,400 in December 2021) to 0.012 ETH (about $20 today) – a 97% drop from the project’s original mint price.  Ben and Steven, who voiced their anger with the project’s progress on Discord, have since been removed from the channel. Meanwhile, Kirshenberg remains optimistic about the project’s future and his involvement in its success.  “I’m still very active. Something I'm very proud of about MTG is the fact that we do have genuine esports gaming holders who actually hold MTG,” Kirshenberg told CoinDesk, explaining that he still owns 25% of MTG and has a decisive voice in the project.  Why the formerly successful project has recently undergone a major personnel and strategy shift remains unclear. Where and how the $8.2 million in initial funds were spent is an even greater mystery.  QGlobe’s Austin told CoinDesk the contracts signed between MTG and her firm were contingent on MTG’s execution of promised deliverables, which she says the project has fallen short of achieving thus far. She also specified that QGlobe had never agreed to partnerships or named companies involved in those early conversations, adding that MTG’s discussion of QGlobe facilitating its IGO were misconstrued – QGlobe said it would only establish the IGO after the game had been released.  “QGlobe went above and beyond and spoon-fed MTG viable, experienced professionals to get the metaverse game completed,” said Austin. “Aaron Kirshenberg’s refusal to spend MTG’s money on metaverse game development resulted in MTG’s rejection by multiple IGO platforms.”  Kirshenberg, when asked to comment by CoinDesk, insisted that a pre-release IGO was promised and called QGlobe’s claims “delusional.”  Kirshenberg says he remains committed to seeing the project through no matter how its road map shifts. He noted that in the coming weeks he plans to make announcements regarding new partnerships and game updates to keep the community morale afloat.  “This next game will certainly be more polished than the last one,” said Kirshenberg.  On Feb. 14, MTG released a trailer for its upcoming Web2 racing mini-game, which some dismissed as another flashy promotional opportunity.  Richie outlined the game’s planned release in a Discord post – a desktop game that will eventually incorporate in-game purchases and rewards to NFT holders before hitting gaming platforms Switch, Steam and eventually mobile.  “We will make this game Web 2.5 to allow us to work faster, but in-game assets with time will evolve into Web 3 with time,” Richie said in Discord.  But many formerly loyal community members appear to have already tapped out of the project, citing underwhelming deliverables, unfulfilled promises and leaders that deserted the project without explanation.  “I would not have ever come near this project if I knew it was going to be just a mobile app game,” said Ben. “I hope the project can admit its fault and do right by the loyal holders like me who have been here since mint and have spent thousands of dollars.”  “It’s like the ‘dine and dash’ NFT, they all ate and left the table, one after the other, so that no one would notice,” said Steven. “Unless funding magically reappears from what was collected at mint or some other source, I don’t expect much deviation from what we have already seen.”",NEGATIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MANA | MARKET | MINING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/03/01/more-than-gamers-sold-a-breakthrough-web3-game-and-delivered-empty-promises,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa1c50c524ba6704b2001911e6c703920cf0d9c8-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421363,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnsuj,1677706946,Weekly Challenge: The Digital Asset Power Hour,"Understandably, crypto regulation is getting a lot of attention. But for investors looking to allocate capital over a longer horizon, focusing too much on tracking legislation and industry legal woes may be a distraction to long-term success.  So what’s an investor to do when news headlines are luring us in with who Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler is after or what Kevin O’Leary thinks of the SEC? Start a weekly challenge, of course!  I call it the Weekly Digital Asset Power Hour.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  I know a lot of financial professionals who block off time for “research” (aka reading news). The challenge is to dedicate at least one of those hours per week to learning about a digital asset. CoinDesk’s Digital Asset Classification Standard has 500 assets waiting for you. (If this at all sounds boring, remind yourself that Warren Buffett has long done this with 10-Ks – oof.)  The more you understand the use cases of individual assets, the better you can diversify beyond bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum’s ether (ETH), whether that be selecting individual assets or taking an index approach. The data suggests that it may also give you a competitive edge.  For example, Bitwise recently surveyed financial advisers. One of the questions made me hesitate. The question was: Which areas of the crypto market do you find most interesting?  Source: Bitwise/VettaFi 2023 Benchmark Survey of Financial Advisor Attitudes Toward Crypto Assets  As I looked at the answers, noting BTC and ETH’s dominance with Web3 and the metaverse way behind, I could not help but think, “Are the advisers really answering the question as it’s worded?” Bitcoin is the largest digital asset, but most interesting? I think they were subconsciously actually answering this: What part of crypto do you understand best? Humans tend not to be interested in things we don’t understand, especially when technical. (Don’t ask me to explain how my iPhone works. I am not interested.)  A follow-up question reinforced my inkling. Most advisers are getting their crypto education from traditional media, which focuses on BTC, ETH, regulation and the latest news on the Sam Bankman-Fried saga.  Why does this matter? It suggests some of the most sophisticated investors – financial advisers – lack broad knowledge of digital assets.  Jennifer Murphy, the CEO of Runa Digital Assets, wrote in a previous version of this newsletter: “Long-term investors would do well to make sure their portfolios include the potential wealth creators that will disproportionately drive market returns in the coming decades.”  The “potential wealth creators” are the crypto use cases that will survive and thrive over the next decade. And one could argue that assets other than BTC and ETH may be larger wealth creators given that being newer means they have a longer growth runway.  For example, take the once buzzworthy metaverse, part of CoinDesk Indices’ Culture & Entertainment sector. Far less attention is now being paid to the metaverse and its underlying digital assets. Yet, recent data from Statista reports that the metaverse could have $490 billion in market revenue by 2030, up from $45 billion in 2022.  The metaverse is vast and evolving. Brands like Starbucks and the NBA are testing digital experiences. BlackRock just launched a metaverse exchange-traded fund (ETF). Venture capital firms like Pantera and a16z are still throwing millions of dollars at metaverse startups, funding the industry's growth.  There are 50 assets in CoinDesk Indices’ Metaverse industry group, all with different use cases. Not a bad place to start your digital asset power hour.

42421359,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnsqb,1677706894,Prosecutors’ Case Against FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Becomes Clearer,"Federal prosecutors have shared more information about their case against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Between two new indictments and civil suits against another former FTX executive, we now have a much clearer picture about what the Department of Justice thinks it has.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Misappropriation  The narrative  Last week, federal prosecutors added four charges to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s criminal case, announcing in a superseding indictment that in addition to the existing fraud and campaign finance violation allegations, they would tack on charges of bank fraud and operating an unlicensed money transmitter, and provide far more detail about the other charges.  Providing further detail about the case against Bankman-Fried were this week’s charges against Nishad Singh, the former director of engineering at FTX. Singh pleaded guilty to criminal charges on Tuesday, but also faces civil charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  Why it matters  Bankman-Fried goes to trial in seven months. Lawyers for both prosecutors and his defense team are still working through discovery, but the newest indictments and lawsuits filed against him and Singh shed a lot more light on the case against Bankman-Fried than his original indictment in January did.  Breaking it down  Last Thursday, prosecutors revealed a superseding indictment against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The new document provided far more details about the allegations against the 30-year-old, including providing more specific charges and tacking on a few additional ones.  Within the pages of the indictment are allegations that Bankman-Fried launched or directed the launch of various companies that could secure bank accounts, as FTX couldn’t on its own. The DOJ says Bankman-Fried oversaw the misappropriation of customer funds and explicitly directed his team to obfuscate the source of funds donated to political campaigns.  Under the superseding indictment, Bankman-Fried faces charges of:  Conspiracy to commit wire fraud on FTX customers  Wire fraud on FTX customers  Conspiracy to commit fraud on FTX customers tied to derivatives  Fraud on FTX customers tied to derivatives  Conspiracy to commit securities fraud on FTX customers  Securities fraud on FTX customers  Conspiracy to commit wire fraud on Alameda Research lenders  Wire fraud on Alameda Research lenders  Conspiracy to commit bank fraud  Conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business  Conspiracy to commit money laundering  Conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions and defraud the FEC  The original indictment merely listed charges of:  Conspiracy to commit wire fraud on customers  Wire fraud on customers  Conspiracy to commit wire fraud on lenders  Wire fraud on lenders  Conspiracy to commit commodities fraud  Conspiracy to commit securities fraud  Conspiracy to commit money laundering  Conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and violate campaign finance laws  Beyond that, the new documents provide a lot of little details that contain rather serious allegations.  “In November 2022, the general counsel of FTX.US warned employees that they should preserve documents because of the involvement of regulators, and then posted in a company Slack channel that FTX would need to be shut down,” one section of the superseding indictment said. “Bankman-Fried, however, deleted the general counsel's message about FTX being shut down, continued to use Signal messaging and proceeded to delete some of his own statements on Twitter, including his tweets about customer assets being ‘fine.’”  The FTX founder also allegedly directed the creation of North Dimension, a U.S.-based company, purely to act as an intermediary between FTX and U.S. banks. Prosecutors claim Bankman-Fried lied about North Dimension’s true purpose to get through a bank’s due diligence process.  Moreover, prosecutors hold that Bankman-Fried never segregated FTX customer assets from Alameda assets or other assets, despite “representations … to the contrary.”  Bankman-Fried “used the FTX customer funds he misappropriated and caused to be misappropriated to, among other things … finance in substantial part [his] unlawful political influence campaign, which involved flooding the political system with tens of millions of dollars in illegal contributions to both Democrats and Republicans made in the names of others in order to obscure the true source of the money and evade federal election law,” the indictment said.  The document alleged that Bankman-Fried, while openly willing to support Democrats, also bolstered Republicans by having an unidentified co-conspirator be the public face of those donations.  While the document does not name the individual, CoinDesk reporting found that dozens of Republicans received donations from FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame. Salame has not been accused of any wrongdoing as of press time.  Another unidentified co-conspirator appears to be Nishad Singh, the former engineering director. While the criminal indictment against Singh does not mention Bankman-Fried by name, prosecutors filed the “conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions” charge against him that they filed against the former CEO.  The indictment details how Singh allegedly donated to candidates and committees well in excess of federal limits and lied about their origin.  “In or about 2022, Nishad Singh, the defendant, and one or more other conspirators agreed to and did make contributions to candidates and committees in the Southern District of New York that were paid for using funds from Alameda Research and reported to the Federal Election Commission in the names of persons other than the true source of the funds,” the filing said.  The SEC and CFTC filings against Singh are both more willing to mention Bankman-Fried (as well as other former FTX executives).  The SEC filing spends a lot of time looking at the way FTX and Alameda were structured, noting Alameda’s ability to have a negative balance on FTX’s books and the alleged misappropriation of customer funds to other uses. Similarly, the CFTC filing claims federal violations based on how the companies were set up and what they actually did.

The eNaira’s travails  By Camomile Shumba  The world is watching Nigeria’s eNaira approach as the country transitions to a new president following heated elections.  Countries around the globe are debating whether to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) within 10 years, and will be absorbing lessons from Nigeria’s live eNaira.  “A lot of people have been watching Nigeria as an experiment,” said Varun Paul, CBDC and market infrastructure director at Fireblocks. Paul was previously the head of the Bank of England's fintech hub.  Countries will likely be looking to see if Nigeria cracks the code on CBDC adoption.  The country launched its eNaira in October 2021, after researching for around two years, and it faced low adoption. A year after it launched, less than 0.5% of Nigerians were using the eNaira, Bloomberg reported.  The Central Bank of Nigeria even limited the amount of cash people can withdraw from banks in January to encourage the adoption of the eNaira but despite its efforts people are not looking to the eNaira as an alternative – even in the midst of a cash crisis.  People are currently complaining on Twitter that they are not able to access basic needs like fuel or food without cash (thanks in part to Nigeria's $220 billion informal economy that relies on cash and a limited amount of bank notes in circulation).

42389622,6F4ZR09tPAWQmeXaoSbPt2,1677703998,"Justin Sun Says Hong Kong’s New Licensing Regime Could Shift Policy in Mainland China, Eventually","The city of Hong Kong is looking to become a virtual asset hub as soon as this summer.  Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain and the man who runs the Huobi crypto exchange, is ready for that change. He said in a tweet Monday that Huobi would apply for a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license in Hong Kong under new requirements to operate that go into effect in June. If approved, the exchange would then launch Huobi Hong Kong.  “Eventually, since Huobi is one of the leading blockchain exchanges in the region … I definitely [have] confidence Huobi will secure the license,” he told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Wednesday.  Huobi, which ranks 15th in overall trading volume according to CoinMarketCap data, is one of the exchanges seeking a license to operate in Hong Kong’s crypto market. Seychelles-based crypto exchange OKX, which ranks eighth in overall trading volume, also plans to apply for a license in the city.  And then there's the looming presence of China.  “Beijing sees Hong Kong as one of the experiment zones for cryptocurrency,” Sun said.  The Chinese government's relationship with crypto has been tumultuous. Two years ago, regulators cracked down on crypto trading and mining.  Sun thinks China is looking at Hong Kong as a kind of experiment, to see if crypto can be regulated on the mainland. If Hong Kong suceeds it could create a change of attitude in Beijing. ""So that's why they want to see Hong Kong do it first,"" he said. ""And then you see the result. If it has positive feedback, they might change the policy in mainland China as well.""  The new requirements don't necessarily mean crypto will be available to Hong Kong retail traders, but at least for now Hong Kong’s securities regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), has extended a lifeline to crypto companies.  “That’s why I think right now [the] Hong Kong government is taking a very transparent and flexible way to discuss crypto regulation with market participants,” Sun said. He added the Huobi exchange has been in talks with SFC regulators to discuss the future of stablecoin regulation.  “I believe Asia’s capital will be a driving force for the next bull run for [the] crypto market,” he said.

The surge comes amid rising interest in multichain projects. It also seems to reflect rising interest in the protocol, which allows users to move digital assets from one blockchain to another, generating cross-chain liquidity.  “The multichain narrative is catching investor excitement,” said Charles Storry, head of growth at Phuture. “Ren, with its legacy and exchange availability, has witnessed the upside of this.”  REN has increased nearly 50% over the last two weeks, according to data from CoinGecko. Storry said he anticipates seeing more ""legacy"" projects like this gain momentum in the short term. Stacks (STX), the open-source platform that enables smart contracts and apps for bitcoin, touted as a competitor of Ren, surged 15% on Wednesday.  In November Ren, which was Alameda-funded, announced it would shift from Ren 1.0 to a more efficient and secure Ren 2.0 version several weeks earlier than expected. It also said that minting through Ren 1.0 had been disabled and Ren 2.0 would be deployed via testnet.  To cover funding needs in the aftermath, the Ren Foundation passed a vote to mint 200 million tokens to fund its transition and growth to Ren 2.0.  The new iteration will also offer RenEVM “an Ethereum-based plugin for Darknode that allows arbitrary programs to be deployed on top of the Ren blockchain,” according to the company’s blog post. “This will mean that Ren will not only support minting and releasing assets between blockchains but also smart contracts that can power any kind of application, cross-chain specialized or not.”  After its loss of funding in November, Twitter rumors circulated that the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Binance, would acquire the protocol. Last week, the rumors resurfaced on a number of Chinese Twitter accounts, possibly contributing to the token’s price uptick. The token also pumped around 26% at the end of November when rumors initially arose.  Binance did not respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.  The majority of trading volume for REN is on centralized exchanges with Binance holding the majority of tokens and Coinbase following.  According to data from research group Sanitment, Ren holders/addresses holding 10,000-1 million tokens are holding their highest amount in three months.

42387997,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR03JZ,1677702156,US SEC Plans to Keep Growing Crypto Unit as Enforcement Ramps Up,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may ramp up its recent surge of cases targeting crypto firms by once again boosting the size of its digital assets enforcement squad.  The regulator, which has been hammering away at the crypto sector under the direction of Chair Gary Gensler, sent a loud message to the industry in May 2022 by announcing it was adding 20 people to its newly named Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. That nearly doubled the size of the 50-person operation, and an SEC spokesperson told CoinDesk that the added slots “are nearly filled.”  Now the agency is “planning to add additional staff” to that unit, the spokesperson said Wednesday, further underlining the priority that digital assets enforcement has become for the SEC. The spokesperson didn’t disclose how many new positions would be added.  The regulator has maintained a steady stream of crypto cases over the past couple of years, but recent weeks saw a spate of enforcement actions and accusations that could form the basis of a kind of shadow rule for digital assets in the absence of formal cryptocurrency policy the industry has been asking for. Many of the cases are building on SEC claims that most digital tokens are unregistered securities, such as FTX’s exchange token FTT and the yield products at a number of firms. It also recently accused Kraken of inappropriately offering securities in the form of its staking service.  The regulator accused Terraform Labs and co-founder Do Kwon last month of deliberately misleading investors about the strength of the doomed terraUSD stablecoin and – again – selling unregistered securities.  But many crypto lawyers’ biggest SEC fear is the agency will finally make an aggressive case against the major trading platforms that they’re running illegal, unregistered exchanges and need to stop.  “Come into compliance,” Gensler said during a discussion last month with reporters about the crypto industry. “Provide the time-tested disclosures and protections to their investors.

The protocol will now charge users a 10% commission fee, the proceeds from which will be evenly distributed among validators and the StaFi decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) Treasury. Previously, the protocol charged its users a 19% staking commission.  ""In order for StaFi to be a mutually beneficial ecosystem, it is crucial to incentivize stakers to participate in the project and contribute to its growth,"" StaFi said in its post.  Staking is a consensus mechanism that validates transactions for proof-of-stake blockchains such as Ethereum, offering users a path to collecting yield on their cryptocurrency holdings.  Under the new 10% commission fee model, 5% of the fee will be allocated to validators, while another 5% will go to the StaFi DAO Treasury. The distribution of the remaining 90% ETH reward will be determined by assessing the ratio of the validator’s capital to the user’s capital.  The new model should incentivize stakers and validators to engage with the StaFi protocol, according to StaFi. But offering more attractive rewards for users will come at the cost of decreasing the StaFi DAO Treasury's own income, potentially limiting StaFi's ability to pay contributors and fund projects on its protocol.  StaFi's move to slash commission fees comes in the runup to the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade, a network upgrade that encompasses a collection of improvement proposals, including one to allow investors to collect their staked, or locked-up, ether. The upgrade, which is slated for March, is expected to boost the number of stakers within the DeFi ecosystem, offering StaFi an opportunity to attract more builders to its protocol.

Non-corporate clients of Kraken will no longer be able to make dollar deposits or withdrawals using Signature, according to an email seen by Bloomberg that was sent to customers on Wednesday. Deposits will be phased out on March 15, while withdrawals will end on March 30.  In its email to users, Kraken said the move was made due to changes by Signature, according to Bloomberg. In an email to CoinDesk, Signature noted that it had previously stated as of Feb. 1, it would no longer support any of its crypto exchange customers in buying and selling amounts of less than $100,000.

42421361,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnssf,1677698479,CoinDesk and Art Blocks Release Microcosms to Supercharge IRL Events With NFTs,"The live events industry is projected to grow to $1.55 trillion by 2028, with significant growth predicted in all major segments of events from sports and music to conferences and corporate events. Sounds good, doesn’t it? But there’s something troubling about this story because it comes at the expense of consumers and their hard-won cash.  When Ticketmaster and Live Nation merged in 2010, a paradigm was created where larger controlling entities exert tremendous sway over everything from ticket access and venue bookings to merchandise rights. That hurts the consumer and all but the very top-performing talent.  An illustration of this is Disney (DIS), which last year announced that its Parks and Experience revenue rose 72%, largely through its Genie+ and Lightning Lane services that let consumers buy in for quicker access to rides and events. How are those consumers rewarded for their loyalty to Live Nation or Disney? By being asked to pay up and renew the next time they want to participate.  A better way  There’s another better way. Blockchain technology has risen to challenge traditional business models, and the opportunity exists to use a decentralized, public ledger to measure participation in a community around live experiences. One could imagine flipping the existing events-ticketing model. A brand could read on-chain data to reward consumers for their dedication and make their experience special based on the financial and time commitments they have spent, not on what the brand hopes they will spend in the future. Not only that, allowing ownership to be permissionless and peer-to-peer enables those same consumers to recoup or profit from their support as they exit an ecosystem and others want to enter.  CoinDesk, which organizes Consensus, the largest event in crypto, wants to be on the right side of this shift from maximizing revenue from loyal users to rewarding the loyalty of users.  That’s why CoinDesk began exploring how Web3 tooling could deepen the relationship with readers and specifically those who come to Consensus, which is now in its ninth year. Our DESK is a participation token that was released in 2021 and continues to evolve, with rewards available to readers of CoinDesk.com. And now, with the addition of Microcosms, a multiyear ticket and reward layer, Web3 is about to be fully entrenched in the conference. CoinDesk still offers traditional ticketing options, but with Microcosms, CoinDesk has added a new option for those who may want to engage in this new ticketing model and to potentially be rewarded by doing so.  For Consensus, CoinDesk has created, with the help of some of the most innovative builders in Web3, a dynamic multiyear, richly layered event experience. This is what we’re calling Microcosms.  What is Microcosms?  Microcosms is up to 1,000 unique works of digital art (NFTs) created by generative artist and engineer Fahad Karim  By being a Microcosm holder, you also get a companion Pro Pass airdropped to your wallet for the next three years (a $3,600 minimum value). You can use, gift or sell the ticket as it is an on-chain asset that you own  Holding Microcosms also gets you the opportunity to receive additional rewards that create a deeper connection with Consensus and the industry. The reward system resets each year until 2025.  Microcosms is powered by the Art Blocks Engine that drives the popular generative art platform.  The back-end reward systems are managed in partnership with Passage Protocol.  The redemption and token gated aspects of the project are managed by Tokenproof.  With Microcosms, we are leaning into all the best benefits that digital collectibles enable. We are supporting creativity and working with a crypto native artist (Fahad Karim) and encouraging people to consider crypto art as worthy of collecting and holding. We also are using on-chain verification to create new ways to access unique experiences, and finally, we are creating a valuable reward system that takes place over a three-year period that encourages people to hold an asset that by doing so, pays holders back.  Why generative art?  Generative art, especially algorithms written to a smart contract, is a native use case of the Ethereum blockchain. Though the first generative art dates back to the 1970s, it’s one of the native art forms of the crypto movement. These non-fungible tokens contain mechanics that enable a richer and more creative experience for collectors.  Why the Art Blocks Engine?  One of the most compelling examples of using creativity and code to build a robust community is Art Blocks. Started in 2020 by Erick Calderon, Art Blocks is a platform that connects artists and audience through collectible digital art. Art Blocks Engine provides a tech platform for companies to fuel creativity through generative design, secured by blockchain technology.  “It’s so exciting to see a wonderfully compelling project that combines all the things I love about collectibility, the art form and a use case for the technology. We are really thrilled to be able to help this come to life,” Calderon told CoinDesk.  The rewards system  Unlike with a traditional event ticket that simply gains you entrance to an event, we focused a set of on-the-ground rewards to enhance an attendee’s experience. Beyond access, all users get our DESK token airdropped to them. The token can be used at the event for food, drink, merchandise or experiences. Based on an algorithm, additional people will receive special rewards like a speaking slot at Consensus, a booth on the show floor, a comped hotel stay or meetings with key venture capitalists who are investing in Web3. If recipients have no use for a reward, they can sell it on the open market to someone who could make use of it. We have more than 350 special rewards to distribute to the 1,000 people who may mint this pass.  This mechanism of rewards will continue each year for the next three years and all IRL (in-real-life) rewards received are airdropped as additional NFTs for the holder to redeem or sell.  See a full list of 2023’s rewards below:  Since 2021, NFT projects have been figuring out new ways of giving back value to a community of fans and collectors. By holding a Bored Ape Yacht Club token in 2021, for example, holders were able to see a private show featuring Beck, The Strokes, Chris Rock and Da Baby. In 2022 VeeFriends holders were given access to a multiday Gary Vaynerchuk event that featured personalities like Eva Longoria, Pharrell Williams, Snoop Dogg and Mila Kunis. We also have started to see traditional events like the Tribeca Film Festival and Coachella dabble in on-chain access passes.  It is still early to determine whether experiments like Microcosms will dramatically shift the experience industry toward decentralized systems. But the premise of adding value instead of purely extracting value from consumers is one that aligns with the ethos of many who work in the blockchain industry. This model opens up new paradigms for general consumers and live event fans all around the world.  Microcosms launches Thursday at CoinDesk.com/ConsensusNFT.

42387993,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR02wB,1677696331,"Ethereum Says ERC-4337 Deployed, Tested, Beginning Era of Smart Accounts","The Ethereum blockchain has deployed a feature known as “account abstraction,” seen as a key enhancement that could make it easier for users to recover crypto if they lose private keys to an online wallet.  The new standard, formally known as ERC-4337, was deployed via a smart contract called EntryPoint, according to data on the blockchain explorer web site Etherscan and confirmed by Yoav Weiss, a security fellow at the Ethereum Foundation. The contract has already undergone a full security audit, people with knowledge of the matter told CoinDesk.  The Ethereum Foundation, which helps to fund and steward development on the blockchain, is expected to announce the development later Wednesday at the ETHDenver conference at a WalletCon event at 5 p.m. local time (0:00 UTC), the people with knowledge of the matter said. Once the announcement is made, several infrastructure providers will announce plans to support ERC-4337 through their services.  Part of the reason why ERC-4337 was so easy to deploy is because the upgrade was made via the addition of a smart contract, so it didn’t require any changes to Ethereum’s underlying programming, which would be complicated to implement. This proposal just adds a new layer atop Ethereum’s mainnet layer. The goal is to eventually integrate account abstraction into the main protocol.  The contract can be used on all EVM chains, meaning it can be deployed anywhere that is EMV-compatible.  Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, tweeted about ERC-4337’s advantages in October.  “We’re narrowing down an actual path for account abstraction, something we’ve always wanted but have not actually managed to have,” Buterin tweeted.  Account Abstraction is a concept that turns users' wallets into smart contract accounts, in order to make Ethereum wallets more user-friendly and to prevent any loss of crypto keys.  This upgrade was seen as a major milestone that would be years away, but the fact that it is already working on the Ethereum blockchain means that making crypto more user-friendly is here.  How does AA work?  On Ethereum, users can create two types of accounts that hold their crypto: External Owned Accounts (EOA) and Contract Accounts (CA).  EOAs, which most Ethereum users opt for, are the type of account you use if you open a MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet.  With EOAs, users are given a pair of private and public keys, and anyone can send crypto to an EOA using their public key. On EOAs, only the owner of their account, the person who has access to their private keys, can initiate transactions.  CAs on the other hand, are accounts controlled by code – not private keys – so they cannot initiate transactions themselves.  The issue with EOAs comes down to human error – if a user loses their private keys, there is no way to recover that. Account Abstraction addresses the issues of an EOA account by merging it with a CA – therefore creating built-in mechanisms that can allow users to keep access to their crypto.  Some of these built-in mechanisms include a social recovery system, where several users have the ability to return access to that account should someone lose their personal private key. Account Abstraction also allows users to create “multisig wallets” that give a group of users access to an account, and require multiple users to sign off on transactions as an extra safety mechanism.

Polygon specializes in scaling systems for the Ethereum blockchain, including the popular Polygon PoS sidechain. According to the company, the new Polygon ID “toolset can be used by developers to unlock features such as an enhanced signup user interface, assist in regulatory compliance, help verify user identities and restrict access control to certain areas or features via token-gating.”  Zero-knowledge technology is a type of cryptography that’s been tipped as one of the hottest trends this year for the digital-asset industry because it eliminates the need for individuals to routinely provide personal information to various web sites or online applications. This advancement has long been viewed as a key potential use case for blockchains.  “Providing identity in a way that the average consumer can use is the holy grail of digital ID adoption,” Polygon co-founder David Schwartz said. “No other identity solution has been able to provide the scalability needed for mainstream adoption leveraging ZK technology until now.”  Under Polygon ID’s design, a person or entity known as the “identity holder” has “claims” stored in a wallet, according to a tutorial on the project posted on GitHub. “Verifiable credentials” are cryptographically signed and issued to the identity holders by an issuer who is a “trusted and reputable party.” Then a verifier checks the proof presented by a holder.  “The simplest example of a Verifier is a Bar that wants to verify if you are over 18. In the real world, the Identity Holder would need to provide an ID and show all their personal information,” according to the tutorial. “With Polygon ID they only need to pass a proof.”  Proofs can be done either off-chain or on-chain via smart contracts.

Setting up a digital dollar, she said, “could help preserve the dollar's global role” and possibly reduce frictions in cross-border transactions. But even if the U.S. doesn’t issue one, she said, government officials are exerting influence with U.S. allies toward “responsible development of CBDCs” in other places, noting that 11 jurisdictions have already moved ahead with their virtual currencies.  Liang said she expects the U.S. process will closely resemble the steps being taken in the U.K., which she noted is further along, having issued a paper last month suggesting the Bank of England will likely need to put out a digital pound at some point. Meanwhile, the European Commission is gearing up to publish a bill in May to underpin a digital euro.  Closer to home for the crypto sector, Liang suggested that CBDCs may become a key element for stablecoin use in the industry.  “It might be used as a backing asset for stablecoins, which could make it easier to transfer value among stablecoins in addition to supporting greater interoperability and choice,” she said.  Liang also mentioned some of the potential risks to establishing a digital dollar, including that a retail version could be vulnerable to destabilizing runs.  The Treasury Department is leading a government working group that’s trying to answer policy questions, and the Federal Reserve – which would ultimately issue a potential CBDC – is separately working on figuring out the potential structure and use for the digital dollar in case the Fed is given a green light from the Biden administration and Congress to go ahead.  Liang, whose remarks were some of the most detailed from a federal official on CBDC progress in months, said the process is still in the research phase and officials are spending much of their time trying to work out whether the U.S. would be best served by a wholesale digital dollar or one available at a retail level to the wider public. She said the group is examining possible trade-offs over privacy concerns, such as setting up a tiered system in which smaller transactions could gather less data about those involved.  If a government token does become available in the future, she said it doesn't cut off other similar avenues for making payments, including a real-time payments system the Fed is expected to launch this year.  ""I don't think there's a predetermined outcome at this point,"" she said, adding the future could include tokenized bank deposits, CBDCs and private-sector stablecoins. ""There's not a presumption that if a CBDC were offered that there would be no other options.""  She said the government wouldn't decide to establish a digital dollar without a sense that the public wants one, and she said her working group will issue “interim public updates” on its progress.  Just one day earlier, a recent top economic adviser for President Joe Biden, Daleep Singh, told U.S. senators that an executive order issued last year was meant to push for the launch of a CBDC. But at least one of the Federal Reserve Board governors, Christopher Waller, is openly opposed to the idea.

42421350,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnsjN,1677691341,Binance Can’t Keep Its Story Straight on Misplaced $1.8B USDC,"A new and detailed investigation by Forbes has raised significant questions about the management and custody of customer assets and stablecoin collateral by Binance. There are many possible explanations for the nature and intent of certain on-chain transactions highlighted by Forbes, and they could be entirely innocuous. But Binance’s so far confused and sometimes contradictory responses to the findings do not inspire confidence, particularly in a post-FTX era of rightfully widespread suspicion of centralized custodians with off-chain balance sheets.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Forbes reported this week that on a single day, Aug. 17, 2022, $1.78 billion worth of collateral moved out of Binance wallets intended to back stablecoins, particularly b-USDC, a wrapped version of Circle’s USDC. According to Forbes’ on-chain analysis, the facts of which Binance has not disputed, $1.2 billion of this was sent to trading firm Cumberland DRW, with other amounts going to now-collapsed hedge fund Alameda Research, Tron founder Justin Sun and crypto infrastructure and services firm Amber Group.  See also: Binance Moved $1.8B in Stablecoin Collateral to Hedge Funds Last Year  Crucially, according to Forbes, this outflow was not accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the circulating supply of b-USDC tokens.  Binance’s various attempts to offer an innocent explanation of Forbes’ findings have not provided a unified and consistent – much less entirely compelling – justification for what could, in the worst case, indicate the misuse of customer funds. Before publishing a more focused and detailed account Wednesday morning, Binance officials offered a number of differing, even contradictory explanations. Equally galling, Binance’s responses have continued the petulant and defensive tone of many of its previous dismissals of close investigative attention.  The worst-case scenario  Forbes’ investigation was motivated by mounting evidence of past problems with Binance’s asset management practices. Binance has admitted to Bloomberg that, for certain periods of time, it failed to maintain clear 1:1 backing of its wrapped b-assets in a segregated and transparent manner. In this context, the exchange’s attempt to paint an act of journalistic analysis as “conspiracy theories,” while suggesting the investigation was motivated by nothing but “collecting a lot of views and clicks,” is beneath the dignity of an organization hoping to maintain a leadership position in a high-risk, fraud-riddled industry.  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao even retreated to the oldest refuge of scrutinized crypto organizations, declaring the Forbes reporting nothing more than “FUD,” or fear, uncertainty and doubt. But this lazy, knee-jerk dismissal, now as ever, ignores a simple reality: Unclear or incomplete answers from the people most obligated to have them are far more serious sources of confusion and anxiety than accepted facts and reasonable questions surfaced by journalists.  The least charitable interpretation of the Forbes findings, articulated as a hypothetical by Lumida CEO and co-founder Ram Ahluwalia on CoinDesk’s “First Mover” program Tuesday, is that Binance was engaged in some form of rehypothecation. That is, that the funds backing b-USDC were loaned to counterparties or otherwise put at risk. Based on this possibility, Forbes has compared its findings to the bad practices that led to the collapse of FTX.  This was broadly the claim made by research firm ChainArgos in a Jan. 2 report that first drew attention to the unusual activity. “Someone received a loan of something like $1 billion for about 100 days,” ChainArgos claimed. “It is not clear exactly what happened … but this is very large, very obviously manual and very recent.”  See also: Binance Considers Severing US Ties in Face of Crypto Crackdown: Bloomberg  Another theory, hinted at in Forbes’ reporting, is that rather than high-risk rehypothecation, the transactions’ net effect was to swap USDC for BUSD issued by Paxos (these events predate a recent New York Department of Financial Services order halting that issuance). This would have allowed Binance instead of Circle to collect the rising interest on instruments including U.S. Treasury bonds that back the stablecoins. This would be a perfectly rational business move, but could mean b-USDC was at points effectively backed by BUSD instead of USDC.  An uncoordinated defense  Binance has firmly denied that anything like rehypothecation has occurred. However, the exchange at first offered misaligned explanations of what actually did happen.  In the course of its investigation, Forbes interviewed Patrick Hillmann, Binance’s chief strategy officer. Hillmann’s explanation, included in the original story, seemed to be simply that the on-chain wallets understood to contain backing for Binance’s stablecoins are effectively meaningless. “There was no commingling” of customer funds, Hillman told Forbes, because “there’s wallets and then there is a ledger.” According to Hillman, this off-chain, internal ledger is what really tracks assets owned, or custodied, by Binance, with on-chain wallets acting as, in his words, mere “containers.”  As Forbes points out, this would seem to undermine Binance’s claims of transparency, instead compelling customers to simply trust the exchange to responsibly handle their money. While its various responses repeatedly cite a new proof-of-reserves system as a rebuttal to suspicions, the transactions in question predate that system, undermining that argument. While Binance has a long track record as a trustworthy custodian, this seems like turning a willful blind eye to the new environment of paranoia and distrust following the collapse of FTX.  Further complicating the picture, a Binance spokesperson on Tuesday wrote the following in a statement to CoinDesk, arguably contradicting elements of Hillmann’s claims to Forbes.  ""Binance does not, and has never, invested or otherwise deployed user assets without consent under the terms of specific products. Binance holds all of its clients’ assets in segregated accounts which are identified separately from any accounts used to hold assets belonging to Binance.”  Note here the spokesperson refers to “holding” customer assets “in segregated accounts,” not to tracking them on an internal ledger. Contra Hillman’s earlier claims to Forbes, Binance is strongly implying here that customer funds are custodied in segregated on-chain wallets. This implication will itself be contradicted before all is said and done.  ""The on-chain transactions identified” by Forbes, the spokesperson continued, “relate to internal wallet management. While Binance has previously acknowledged that wallet management processes for Binance-pegged token collateral have not always been flawless, at no time was the collateralization of user assets affected. Processes for managing our collateral wallets have been fixed on a longer-term basis and this is verifiable on-chain.""  Next, on the morning of Feb. 28, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao took to Twitter to push back against Forbes’ findings. His explanation differed from those previously offered by a C-suite executive and his communications team. Hillman claimed the on-chain transactions highlighted by Forbes meant nothing, with all the real accounting under the hood. A Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk that they were part of “internal rebalancing.” But Zhao characterized them as “some old blockchain transactions that our clients have done.”  “Our users are free to withdraw their assets any time they want,” he continued. “Their withdrawals are turned into ‘received hundreds of millions of shifted collateral.’”  This explanation doesn’t entirely pass the smell test even on its own terms. First, describing these as “blockchain transactions” reads like an attempt to suggest they were not mediated by Binance at all. This would directly contradict characterization of the transactions as “internal rebalancing.” Further, Zhao’s characterization implies that Cumberland DSW alone owned or managed $1.2 billion worth of USDC mirrored as b-USDC on Binance, then cashed it all out on the same day – a decidedly unusual circumstance.  A more reasonable inference would be that the big transaction to Cumberland represents the on-chain reconciliation of a large number of customer moves over time, which would make it both a “rebalancing” and a “customer withdrawal.” But none of Binance’s responses explicitly make that claim.  The remainder of the CEO’s thread reiterates Binance’s track record and cites Binance’s recent implementation of a proof-of-reserves system – even though that process has had its share of missteps.  He also writes that “my Chinese ethnicity is brought up again” in the Forbes article, “as if that mattered.” Zhao has arguably been unfairly targeted because of his ethnicity in the past, particularly in attempts to draw connections between him and the Chinese government. But the Forbes article properly refers to him as “Chinese Canadian,” and only does so one time, when introducing him. The words “China” or “Chinese” do not otherwise appear in the piece. At least in this case, Zhao’s complaint looks like a fairly baseless attempt to distract from and discredit the report’s actual findings.  Vagaries and name-calling  After offering three divergent characterizations of Forbes’ findings (the facts of which, it must be emphasized, they did not dispute), Binance finally released what would seem to be its definitive statement on March 1, a blog post titled “How and Why Assets Move Between Binance Wallets.”  The post still includes its share of confusion, but at least lands on a single explanation of Forbes’ findings: The moves were “simply a case of institutional clients withdrawing their own assets from our platform.” This claim comes with very little detail, inviting further scrutiny that it may or may not withstand.  The post does not rebut the core finding, by Forbes and others, that the “peg wallet” meant to back various wrapped assets has been repeatedly off its proper collateralization level. It does not explicitly state, for instance, that backing assets for b-USDC were simply held elsewhere in Binance’s on-chain custody system. Instead, the post settles for the vaguer claim that ""at no time was the collateralization of user assets affected"" by peg wallet mismanagement.  The statement essentially reiterates Hillman’s initial point that on-chain accounts managed by Binance do not necessarily correspond to real customer balances. This is common practice among crypto exchanges, but amounts to hand-waving in this context. The post refers broadly to “a vast network of hot, cold and deposit wallets” and to “the fact that the movement of funds between wallets could serve a variety of purposes.” The gist sometimes seems to be “you wouldn’t really understand even if we explained it to you.”  See also: Changpeng Zhao Won't Rescue Binance by Selling out Crypto | Opinion  Binance also strikes an incoherent stance towards journalism and oversight. On the one hand, the exchange touts its transparency and says it welcomes scrutiny. It also again admits it has in the (relatively recent) past failed to properly manage pegged assets. This would seem to justify increased scrutiny – yet the post also repeatedly denigrates journalists as little more than clickbait-hungry, conspiracy-theorizing ambulance chasers.  After the collapse of FTX, Celsius Network and a half-dozen other apparent frauds, this perspective is deeply out of touch with the anxieties of crypto investors and users. Those anxieties have manifested in meaningful outflows from Binance custody and assets over the past month.  It’s unclear whether Binance’s vague, defensive, sometimes confusing responses to the latest round of scrutiny is sufficient to quiet those concerns.",NEGATIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | WALLET | BNB | USDC,David Z.

42421362,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnsth,1677691225,Centralized Exchange Scrutiny Will Spur Research of Decentralized Exchanges,"The push following the FTX exchange’s collapse to regulate centralized crypto exchanges will likely be a net positive for those looking to expand their understanding of crypto. I don’t say that as someone who advocates for or against regulation, but as someone who expects crypto participants to adapt as the environment shifts.  I recognize the importance of regulation, but am sometimes skeptical of the motivations behind it. I also live on Earth, more specifically New Jersey. So I walk around with the underlying assumption that regulation, like bad traffic, is largely unavoidable.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  On Feb. 9, we saw Kraken agree to shutter its U.S. crypto-staking operations and pay a $30 million fine to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  On Feb. 23, the SEC objected to Binance.US’ deal to purchase assets of now-defunct crypto lender Voyager Digital.  Coinbase faces scrutiny, too, having to publicly state that its staking products are “fundamentally different” from the yield products Kraken was forced to stop offering.  All three things involve centralized exchanges (CEX). That root word “central” sure looks like a regulatory bullseye now.  When I was early in my crypto journey, centralized exchanges served as a welcome on-ramp where I could set up an account, link to a bank account (letting me easily bring fiat money into the digital asset realm) and then press a button and see that I’d just purchased bitcoin (BTC). I also provided loads of personal information during the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process.  For purists, this all runs completely counter to the crypto ideal of decentralized, trustless, peer-to-peer transactions. I actually think the existence of centralized exchanges is a positive. For many investors it represents a comfortable way to gain access to this space, via an accountable entity. I expect them to stay.  But I also expect that the recent crackdown – and, in all candor, I think some of the increased scrutiny has been earned following the bankruptcy of FTX – will accelerate the learning curve for those willing to dive into decentralized exchanges (DEX), which operate very differently from anything you see in traditional finance (TradFi).  As an investor, my interest would not just be in the exchanges themselves, but also the tokens associated with them and their economics. For market-centric people from the TradFi world – as I am – that requires a certain level of commitment to learning the technical differences behind many of these protocols.  Certain fundamental attributes are certainly worth paying attention to. For starters, with DEXs you will largely be dealing with code as opposed to humans. Math as opposed to management. Unlike crypto CEXes, DEXes do not really resemble the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.  Decisions that management teams make within CEXs are instead handled at DEXs through a vote among token holders. Governance is enforced in a trustless and decentralized manner.  For point of reference, the largest DEX by market capitalization is Uniswap. The $5 billion market cap of its UNI token pales in comparison to Binance’s BNB token ($48 billion). In a sense this illustrates the potential opportunity that exists within the DEX landscape.  The distribution of capital from DEXs also presents some interesting opportunities. Akin to stock buybacks in the traditional world, DEXs will often distribute value back to token holders via a token burn, or a token buy back and burn. In short, the objective is to reduce the supply of the asset, which (when supply and demand dynamics hold true to form) lend to increased values for the asset.  In fairness, this is done by both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The distinction with DEXs, however, is that while a CEX has to consider the interest of both individual shareholders and token holders, no such conflict exists within DEXs.  There is no company president or management team to consider. Only the token holders themselves, who can often vote for or against the payment mechanism. The decision is up to the network itself.  DEX tokens often provide incentives to holders on the basis of yield generation, reduced trading fees and governance. As the demand for usage of the network increases, the value of the asset is likely to as well, without the overhang of malfeasance, and the extreme target of regulators (at least for now).  All told, increased scrutiny of centralized exchanges will likely lead to increased knowledge and adoption of decentralized ones. In many ways, this aligns closer with the original Bitcoin white paper, which in large measure kicked everything off.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk’s Nick Baker, here’s some recent news worth reading:  BITCOIN BUILDERS: Despite the Bitcoin blockchain’s influence and giant size, an excellent CoinDesk piece explores the potentially shaky ground beneath its development amid the crypto winter. It comes down to money: Will there be enough to pay the people who maintain the infrastructure? While it’s hard to believe Bitcoin will be left out to dry, the fact that such a story needs writing tells you just how chilly it’s gotten out there.  NBA MESS: NBA Top Shot is a non-fungible token (NFT) collection that lets basketball fans collect video clips from games. Innocuous stuff, you might think. Just like paper trading cards of yore? Well. A judge just ruled there’s reason to believe they could be securities. The kind of things that need to be registered, with paperwork and such, like stocks or bonds. Satoshi Nakamoto’s fun little experiment keeps slamming into the mountain of conventional financial regulation.  ARBITRUM ASCENDS: One of the hot stories of 2021 was how Solana would bring to crypto the industrial-grade transaction processing capacity that conventional markets, finance and banking was accustomed to. The biggest smart contract-based blockchain, Ethereum, the thinking went, just wasn’t up to the task. Plain-vanilla Ethereum remains relatively slow and expensive; Visa or the New York Stock Exchange aren’t turning to it anytime soon. And while Solana has not made major progress, in recent months scaling up Ethereum by offloading transactions to related platforms has gotten traction. And one of them, Arbitrum, just hit a milestone: it handled more transactions in a 24-hour period than Ethereum. This could be the future for resource-intensive projects.  FTX HFT: Folkvang is a high-frequency trading firm that got hurt by FTX’s collapse. Much of its money was tied up there. While it’s not holding its breath waiting to get any of it back, the company is still standing. ""We learned a hard lesson with FTX,"" founder Mike van Rossum said in a recent interview. ""We found that risk is real. We thought it could never really happen in the way it did, so we are a lot more risk averse now.""

Coinbase didn’t supply any additional details.  On Wednesday morning, Armstrong appeared on Bloomberg TV and gave a more detailed explanation for the move.  “The reason we did that was that Paxos, the issuer of BUSD, had been ordered to stop minting it, so we were concerned about liquidity issues for our customers,” Armstrong said.

The startup will use the funds toward its second-quarter product launch and to continue building out the core technology.  Investments cascaded into crypto companies during the bull market of 2021, but have slowed to a drip due to the crypto winter. Infrastructure projects, however, have maintained the highest level of investor interest, particularly projects that make it easier for non-crypto natives to enter the space.  Kansas-based Redeem allows users to link any crypto wallet on any network to a phone number in order to redeem so-called utility NFTs such as tickets, loyalty points or in-game items by scanning a QR code. Users can also send and receive NFTs through Apple's iMessage, WhatsApp or text messages without adding a crypto interface or gas fees.  “Adoption is the Holy Grail of Web3. Redeem’s core features allow users to access the universe of Web3 in seconds with no prior crypto blockchain knowledge,” said Kenetic Founder Jehan Chu in a press release. “This is a game-changer for traditional enterprise companies who want to reduce cost and drive new user engagement via Web3 without complicated or risky crypto processes.”  Redeem was founded by Toby Rush, who previously founded EyeVerify, a biometric tech company that was acquired by an affiliate of Chinese tech conglomerate Alibaba for $100 million in 2016.  Other investors in the round included Monochrome Capital, VC3 DAO, The Fund, Flyover Capital, CMT Digital, KCRise Fund and KESTREL 0x1.

While other Fed officials have expressed optimism on a soft landing, he said he's not sure if that can be accomplished. One cause for concern is that Fed's rate hikes so far have not slowed the services side of the economy, Kashkari said. Also, wage growth level is currently too high.

While recent data has been troubling, ""we don't want to overreact"" to just one month of data, he added.

42388003,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR0E1l,1677683488,Lido Community Conducting Snapshot of V2 Upgrade Design Approval,"Lido, the biggest liquid staking platform on the Ethereum blockchain, has begun preliminary voting on a software overhaul that will also clear the way for staked token withdrawals.  On Tuesday, the protocol opened a snapshot vote on its version 2 (v2) upgrade, which includes a “Staking Router” said to ease onboarding of different validator subsets. The second element of the v2 upgrade will allow users to redeem Lido’s flagship stETH tokens for the underlying ether tokens once Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade, more accurately known as “Shapella,” hits.  Lido had 5,669,612 ETH staked at press time, according to Nansen, giving stETH a market cap over $9.2 billion.  The snapshot vote gives the Lido community a chance to signal its support or opposition to the proposal before it goes to an on-chain vote, the final step to approving the mainnet upgrade. This stage of the process runs through March 7; at press time it is very close to unanimous support.  In an email to CoinDesk, Misha Putiatin, a representative from Statemind.io, a blockchain security firm conducting a cover-to-cover audit of Lido's entire codebase, wrote ""Lido is a #1 [decentralized finance protocol] by [total value locked] and withdrawals are #1 event of the year close to EIP-4844 scaling update so the incentive to do this right is massive. All eyes, some of them quite malicious, are going to be on withdrawals this spring so we will perform at our peak.""  The upgrade will bring a ""significant rewrite"" to Lido’s on-chain code and off-chain code, according to the vote’s forum discussion.  In addition to stETH to ETH withdrawals and a new modular architecture for staking, the upgrade will rewrite Lido’s oracle smart contract and off-chain software in order to process withdrawals.  The voting to approve these vast infrastructure changes began even before Lido’s chosen vetters finished their work. Lido lists seven auditors involved in checking the security of its v2 code, but only one, ChainSecurity, appears to have completed its audit. “The audit scope is huge, 7.5+K lines of code. It’s akin to reading a book where you must keep track of each character’s actions and the structure of each scene, all while keeping an eye out for any discrepancies or irregularities,” Putiatin said.  Lido leads the pack  The snapshot for v2’s design approval coincides with Lido surpassing 5.6 million ETH deposits, worth roughly $9.3 billion, according to a Dune dashboard created by Lido’s analytics team. Lido, the leader of the liquid staking sector, now commands 37.7% of all ether in Ethereum’s staking contract, per Etherscan.  Last week, Lido’s share of total weekly deposits in Ethereum’s staking contract was 71.6%, as tweeted by Lido’s official Twitter account, which included Tron founder Justin Sun staking 150,000 ETH, or $240.7 million, on Feb. 25 in three transactions (1, 2, 3). Monday, he performed the largest staking transaction, per Nansen, by staking 88,000 ETH worth about $141.5 million.  The liquid staking sector across blockchains has a total value locked of $14.03 billion, making it the second-biggest sector in the crypto space surpassing decentralized lending and borrowing, according to TVL aggregator DefiLlama. Lido, on just Ethereum and not other blockchains, controls more than 65% of crypto’s total liquid staking sector.  Lido’s LDO governance token has jumped 44% to $3.04 since the beginning of February, making LDO’s total market capitalization stand at almost $2.56 billion.

The program is backed by Jump Crypto, the investment arm of Chicago-based market maker Jump Trading Group.  Chiliz Labs will invest in Web3 projects that build on Chiliz's layer 1 blockchain. Chiliz expects to announce between eight and 10 projects building on the network soon, it said in an email shared with CoinDesk.  Chiliz, whose Socios.com flagship platform sells coins tied to top-level sports teams, such as soccer's FC Barcelona, Juventus and Manchester City, has raised $66 million in total funding, Crunchbase data show. Digital trading card company Sorare, which has deals with all five of Europe's top national soccer leagues, raised more than $600 million in funding last year.  Targeted projects could include those selling tickets in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or offering fan tokens similar to those on Socios, which fans buy to gain access to VIP experiences and the chance to vote on minor matters in the running of the clubs. Fan tokens have a total market capitalization of over $300 million and 24-hour trading volume of over $40 million, according to CoinGecko data.  ""Chiliz has developed a unique solution to one of the most salient problems that sports teams and leagues face, which is how to sustainably and affordably scale their brands and maximize fan engagement globally,"" Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, said.  Still, such tokens have attracted criticism as being an attempt to separate fans from their money by making them think they are actually buying a stake in their favorite teams. That's rejected by Chiliz founder and CEO Alexandre Dreyfus, who said that demand is high, with fans seeking programs that reward their loyalty, comparing it with airline loyalty programs.  ""Through these Web3 or digital membership program, teams can reach and 'own' their global audiences, audiences and fan communities currently only reached by social-media companies,"" Dreyfus told CoinDesk.  Chiliz blockchain is EVM-compatible (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and runs a proof-of-stake authority validation system. Its native token CHZ has a market cap of just under $1 billion.

42388004,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR0Dx5,1677678808,Former Accounting Team of FTX US Auditor Armanino Sets Up Shop as The Network Firm,"Members of the accounting firm Armanino’s digital-asset practice have departed and formed a startup – The Network Firm – to carry on the business of providing audits, attestations and related work for crypto clients.  The move, confirmed to CoinDesk this week by people with knowledge of the matter, came after Armanino late last year decided to stop performing crypto audits amid heightened scrutiny of its past work for a U.S. affiliate of Sam Bankman-Fried’s failed FTX exchange. Armanino has said it stands by its 2020 and 2021 audits of FTX US.  The official separation of the digital-asset team, led by Noah Buxton, took effect on Wednesday, the people said. According to the company’s LinkedIn page, The Network Firm was founded this year and is based in Miami.  Armanino’s former crypto clients included crypto exchange Kraken, digital-asset lender Nexo and investment firm CoinShares. Several of the accounts are expected to follow the team to the new firm, the people said.  Buxton declined to comment at this time.  The crypto industry was hit hard by FTX’s collapse, with plunging prices for bitcoin (BTC), solana (SOL) and other tokens, a slew of industry bankruptcy filings, the filing of class-action lawsuits, a regulatory crackdown and extra attention from lawmakers.  The Armanino episode highlights another chokepoint: Crypto firms are finding it ever-harder to get large, established accounting firms to provide audits and reserve attestations, even as the digital-asset industry pushes desperately to shore up trust and a reputation battered by 2022’s developments.  In December, Paris-based Mazars, a 47,000-professional global accounting firm that worked with Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, said it was pausing proof-of-reserves work for crypto clients.  San Ramon, California-based Armanino is a top-25 firm with more than 2,500 employees and 22 offices across the U.S. The Network Firm, by contrast, has fewer than 20 people, with eight key team members listed on its new website.  Small but mighty  A banner on the company’s website says its founders “have pioneered the development of crypto-native accounting and attestation services as well as traditional tax and audit capabilities since 2016.”  “The Network Firm is 100% focused on the professional service needs of the crypto and digital asset industry,” the website reads. “We know that digital assets will transform all sectors of our economy driven by the potential of blockchain. As this shift accelerates, The Network Firm will play a vital role in providing trust and transparency championing this new industry.”  The pitch might be less impressive to large investors and companies from traditional finance, as they are likely to be more focused on the reputational risks of trusting the audit work of a just-established firm with more limited resources.  Crypto companies, many of them still fledgling operations themselves, likely wouldn’t be as bothered or deterred by the notion of working for a small firm with a short track record – especially when the former Armanino accountants can rightfully boast about their knowledge and experience in the nascent and fast-moving industry.  In January, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon, both Democrats, wrote a letter to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) asking if the activities of Armanino and Prager Metis, another accounting firm that did business with FTX, were consistent with “professional practice standards” or if there were any warnings of “a lack of professional skepticism.” (PCAOB Chair Erica Williams has said that the agency couldn’t inspect FTX’s audits because it’s not a public company.)  Peewee or prototype?  Francine McKenna, a full-time lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton Business School who has written extensively on crypto auditing practices, says that even firms the size of Armanino’s are seen in the accounting industry as a significant step down from the “Big Four” of Deloitte, PwC, Ernst & Young and KPMG.  Few of those bigger firms would agree to audit work for crypto companies, she said, though Deloitte does work with Coinbase, the publicly traded U.S. crypto exchange.  “It’s incredibly risky even for a firm in the Big Four that has hundreds of thousands of people available to them globally, and people who have experience in all industries, particularly the financial industry,” she said.  For now, most blockchain firms may have to rely on these smaller outfits.  “They’ve gone from the bush leagues down to peewee,” she said.  A key innovation of the Armanino digital-asset team, the TrustExplorer tool designed to provide real-time data on project reserves to blockchain users, has been ported over to The Network Firm, people with knowledge of the matter said.  The new website describes a real-time reserves product, LedgerLens, designed to “close the visibility gap between on-chain liabilities and off-chain assets, all with industry-standard attest reporting, and at unmatched frequency.”  Executives at Archblock, which supports the trueUSD stablecoin, a customer of the former Armanino real-time reserves reporting service, were “very surprised” when they learned the larger accounting firm was ditching crypto clients, according to Chief Financial Officer Alex de Lorraine.  Archblock plans to continue its use of the product under The Network Firm, he said.  “The firm may be new, but the partners have been working in the industry for a long time, and many of the team members were part of the initial attestation engine,” de Lorraine told CoinDesk in an email.  Kraken, another client, was “understandably disappointed in Armanino’s decision to end their crypto practice” but remains “firmly committed to undergoing proof-of-reserves audits,” according to a press representative.  “Kraken is currently exploring a range of options to continue to provide clients with full transparency and a means to cryptographically verify that funds held in supported assets are held in full on the exchange,” the representative told CoinDesk in an email. “We look forward to sharing more details about our plans in the near future.”  Press officials for CoinShares and Armanino declined to comment.  After publication of this story, a spokesperson for Nexo emailed the following comment:  Nexo’s real-time, online reserves attestation continues to be available at https://real-time-attest.trustexplorer.io/nexo and is updated daily.

The Shanghai fork will allow ether that has been staked and is now locked to be withdrawn for the first time.  Bernstein’s analysis shows the supply increases are likely to be spread over a few weeks, even months, resulting in little selling pressure on a daily basis. The brokerage firm sees a limited impact on the supply of ether, but noted that weak sentiment due to ""unstaking"" could put pressure on ether's price before the upgrade..  On the positive side, the market expects the removal of a lock-in to lead to more people staking their ETH, which will give investors confidence with unstaking.  “The availability of and wide adoption of existing pooled staking tokens that have held their peg well negates the case for a significant increase in staking immediately after the Shanghai upgrade,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  The “Shanghai upgrade may attract some additional staking from institutional investors (who may not want to stake through liquid staking platforms),” they added.  Bernstein said the “steady-state staking penetration” for Ethereum will gradually increase and the Shanghai upgrade is a step in that direction.

10132922,https://blokt.com/?p=56298,1677672127,AI and Crypto: Examining the Hype and Recent Price Trends,"While AI is being touted as the latest hype in Silicon Valley, replacing crypto , it’s worth acknowledging that the hype surrounding crypto has likely just faded because its prices have declined steeply over the last 15 months. This is nothing new, as crypto prices have fluctuated heavily since their creation over 13 years ago, with periods of intense hype during the bull markets and a lot of “FUD” during the bear markets. However, what makes AI impressive is its immediate usefulness and rapid adoption. As a result, people are increasingly incorporating AI into their daily lives to aid them in their work and other activities. In contrast, while tens of millions of people own crypto, it has yet to experience widespread adoption for daily use in things like payments and smart contracts. Instead, crypto is still most commonly used for speculation and investing. But how could AI impact crypto itself, and what are the top names in crypto utilizing AI? This article explores just that and will show how AI-based cryptocurrencies are leading the pack in the most recent crypto price rally. A Look at the Top AI Cryptocurrencies According to sites like CoinMarketCap and CryptoSlate, some leading AI cryptocurrencies (by market cap) include The Graph, SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, and Numeraire. Here’s how each of these uses artificial intelligence. Numerai (NMR) Numerai is a hedge fund that uses machine learning to try and predict the stock market as accurately as possible. It hosts machine-learning tournaments and incentivizes top data scientists to participate by rewarding those with the most accurate models with Numeraire (NMR) tokens. To date, Numerai has paid out $53 million in NMR to data scientists. The Graph (GRT) The Graph Network is a decentralized indexing protocol that utilizes AI to simplify searching and retrieving data from blockchain networks like Ethereum. The protocol allows developers to quickly and easily query specific data without needing a centralized entity. Open APIs on The Graph, known as subgraphs, can be built and published by anyone, allowing easy data access. Given how AI plays a central role in web2 applications like Google search, the convergence of AI and web3 is also critical. SingularityNET (AGIX) SingularityNET is trying to usher us into the era of decentralized AI. As a leading AI marketplace powered by blockchain, its core mission is to develop beneficial artificial general intelligence (AGI). With SingularityNET, AI-driven solutions will, someday, facilitate the formation of open-sourced, decentralized human-level intelligence that serves the common good. Using blockchain, they hope to create an equitable global network where value, power, and technology are equally distributed. Fetch.ai (FET) Fetch.ai is paving the way for a decentralized future by using machine learning and blockchain technologies to facilitate an alternative to the currently restrictive, centralized data silos. Their mission is to allow anyone to create and deploy AI services at scale, potentially transforming multiple industries. Recently, Bosch partnered with Fetch.ai and agreed to allocate funds to a $100 million grant program intended to develop Web3, AI, and decentralized technologies for real-world use cases. Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) Ocean Protocol aims to address a critical issue in our data-driven society. This project, governed by a Singapore-based non-profit foundation, seeks to distribute the immense value data creates equitably through its platform. Currently, a few large organizations with massive data assets and powerful AI capabilities monopolize the benefits of data, which Ocean believes threatens a free and open society. Instead, Ocean Protocol aims to promote the fair use of data and ensure that it is leveraged for the betterment of all. What Do Influential Figures in Crypto Think About AI? Most leaders in the crypto industry have yet to express substantial views on how AI might impact their respective projects. However, with the current buzz surrounding AI and ChatGPT, several influential figures have taken to social media or blogs to air their thoughts. Here’s what some of them had to say: Vitalik Buterin: In a recent blog , he shared his experience testing ChatGPT to help him code. Vitalik concluded that AI is improving quickly and is a helpful programming aid, but still far from replacing human programmers. Charles Hoskinson: In a tweet , he revealed his use of AI to create art. He remarked, “I can’t imagine how amazing this technology will be in three years.” Sandeep Nailwal: The Polygon co-founder called for a DAO version of ChatGPT in a tweet , stating it’s too powerful to be controlled by a single entity. Binance: In a recent blog , the company states that ChatGPT could help crypto adoption by providing a conversational educational tool, improving customer support, and even aiding with smart contract coding. How the Hype Surrounding AI Is Affecting Crypto Prices While crypto, on the whole, has been rallying from lows for the last month or so, traders have been gambling on AI-related cryptocurrencies outperforming, and they have been doing so. Here’s how the five AI cryptocurrencies we looked at earlier have performed versus Bitcoin since January 2023: Bitcoin: +41.00% Numeraire: + 58.05% The Graph: + 179.98% Ocean Protocol: +144.74% SingularityNET: +808.17% Fetch.ai: +376.85% However, it’s hard to tell if AI cryptos will continue outperforming or if the hype will fade and prices will retrace. For example, BuzzFeed (BZFD) rallied 350% on the stock market in two days after reporting that they would use ChatGPT to help them create content. However, prices retraced quickly after, and BZFD is now only up around 70% since making the announcement, and its price could continue lower. In the crypto space, the gameFi token Cocos-BCX rallied more than 250% in five days after merely mentioning AI in a suggestive tweet: COCOS + AI = ? #CocosBCX #COCOS #BNB — Cocos-BCX (@CocosBCX) February 8, 2023 So far, COCOS-BCX has maintained its rapid gains. While there will likely be potentially profitable opportunities ahead for investors and traders in AI-related coins, there has also been a notable rise in scams attempting to exploit the AI trend. For example, numerous fraudulent “ChatGPT” coins have been launched recently for pump and dump schemes, similar to the fake “Squid Game” token we saw in 2021.

42388010,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR0EP9,1677672000,Upcoming Upgrades That Will Shape the Ethereum Ecosystem,"If you're feeling overwhelmed by all the upgrades and launches happening in the Ethereum ecosystem, we've got you covered with important dates to keep in mind.  The Shanghai upgrade is drawing near  The Shanghai upgrade, more accurately known as “Shapella,” will enable the release of staked ether (ETH) withdrawals. Ever since Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, the network began using validators who stake 32 ETH to approve and add blocks to the blockchain.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Before validators joined the PoS blockchain, they agreed that their staked ETH and any accrued rewards would remain locked up until Shanghai. Some validators have had their ETH locked up since as early as December 2020, when the PoS “Beacon Chain” went live. But, finally, the time for unlocking those rewards is nearing.  Ethereum developers haven’t inked in an official date, but those working on the blockchain have said they are aiming for March for the big upgrade.  Given that the calendar has already flipped to March, there’s a strong likelihood that Shanghai might be delayed to April. Ethereum developers ran a second dress rehearsal of Shanghai earlier this week on the Sepolia testnet, but they have yet to decide when the final dress rehearsal will occur.  If developers continue to run tests three weeks apart as they have done with Sepolia and Zhejiang, Goerli will likely occur around March 20, which could push the mainnet Shanghai upgrade into early April. (Ethereum is notorious for running a touch behind schedule, although last year’s Merge won plaudits for its mostly smooth execution.)  Read more: What Is the Ethereum Blockchain’s Shanghai Hard Fork, and Why Does It Matter?  Optimism to upgrade to Bedrock  Optimism, an Ethereum layer 2 scaling system, will go through a major upgrade in March that aims to decrease transaction fees, increase the speed of transactions and enhance smoother compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).  The layer 2 protocol aims to lower the cost of Ethereum transactions while maintaining the security of the Ethereum blockchain. It does this by providing an “Optimistic rollup,” a type of scaling system that bundles a bunch of transactions and sends them back to the Ethereum blockchain as a single transaction. The cost of that one transaction is then split among many users.  The upgrade, known as “Bedrock,” will be a major upgrade to the network. Some have said the upgrade will help Optimism compete with its main competitor, Arbitrum.  Optimism initially tweeted in early February that it was reviewing the specifications for the Bedrock upgrade, scheduled for March 15. But, a few weeks later, the Optimism Foundation announced it would postpone the vote on the upgrade to March 2–April 5 due to some bugs found in the code changes.  The upgrade itself won’t affect end users but it will take about four hours for Optimism to upgrade to Bedrock, according to a post on their governance website. Given that Optimism was supposed to upgrade two weeks after the initial vote cycle, the new timeline appears to indicate Bedrock will go live in mid-April.  In February, OP Token, the native token for Optimism, surged 25% amid news of the Bedrock upgrade.  Read more: What Are Rollups? ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups Explained  The ZK-rollup race intensifies  Another scaling project to Ethereum, Polygon, is coming out with its own rollup system in March.  Polygon has been working on its own Zero-Knowledge Rollup (ZK Rollup) for a while, and in February announced the launch date of its beta zkEVM for March 27.  ZK rollups use complex cryptography that create “proofs” that show that a transaction is valid using only minimal information about that transaction. The zkEVM deploys the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for its ZK rollup, allowing developers to move over their Ethereum smart contracts without any hiccups.  ZK technology was once seen as a milestone that would be years away, but others in the ZK rollup space are racing to be the first to launch their rollup solutions.  Matter Labs recently announced that it would rebrand and make open source its ZK rollup, zkSync 2.0, to zkSync Era, though it did not say when the full network would go live. Developers of Scroll, another layer 2 on Ethereum, have also said they are coming out with their own ZK rollup. Earlier this week, Scroll announced it is taking the zkEVM to Ethereum’s Goerli testnet.  So who will release their full-fledged ZK rollup first? Based on the heightened level of activity in this arena, the answer might come sooner rather than later.

10132367,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4583271-hive-pivoting-to-ai?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1677670951,HIVE: Pivoting To AI?,"Summary HIVE Blockchain is one of the largest publicly traded crypto miners with assets in Canada, Sweden, and Iceland. As expected, HIVE closed out calendar 2022 on a whimper with the crash in digital currency prices and a huge write-off in mining equipment. Looking forward, HIVE is hyping up a pivot to use its GPUs in 'AI' applications. I remain skeptical until we see more financial details. Where to begin? In November, I penned an article suggesting that HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. ( HIVE ) could potentially be mining bitcoin at a negative margin. I was also cautious because HIVE had continued to invest heavily towards Ethereum mining equipment, right up until the Proof-of-Stake (""POS"") merge , so there was potential for a large asset writedown. Unfortunately, both of my worries came to fruition in the months since my article. Financials Going From Bad To Worse As digital currencies collapsed in the second half of 2022 due to a myriad of scandals and bankruptcies, including the bankruptcy of FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, HIVE's fortunes went from bad to worse. As we can see from figure 1 below, HIVE went from a 3% gross margin in fiscal Q1/2023 (June 30, 2022), to -28% gross margin in Q2/2023 (September 30, 2022), to -117% gross margin in Q3/2023 (December 31, 2022)! Figure 1 - HIVE financial summary (HIVE Q3/23 MD&A) The revenues HIVE brought in from crypto-mining in Q3/23, $14.3 million, barely covered the electricity costs to run the mining equipment, let alone cover the depreciation of the mining equipment and G&A expenses of the company. Furthermore, as I highlighted in my prior article, HIVE faced obsolescence costs on its Ethereum mining equipment as Ethereum switched from Proof-of-Work (""POW"") to Proof-of-Stake (""POS""). In fact, in Q2 and Q3/2023, HIVE took a combined $87.7 million impairment charge to mining equipment and equipment deposits. Crypto Mining Is A Terrible Business Is crypto mining a terrible business? HIVE's cumulative financials since going public suggest so. HIVE has the dubious distinction of having lost a cumulative $284 million since the company went public, despite the company having recorded $441 million in cumulative revenues from mining crypto currencies (Figure 2). Figure 2 - HIVE has lost money since IPO (Author created with data from tikr.com) Even ignoring asset writedowns and impairments, HIVE has generated cumulative operating loss of $68 million since going public, as electricity, SG&A, and mining equipment depreciation has eaten up more than 100% of revenues. Bitcoin Prices Have Bounced, Is Hive's Future Looking Bright? Since the end of 2022, bitcoin prices have staged an impressive 50% bounce, from ~$16k in December to ~$24k recently, does this mean HIVE's future looks bright? While bitcoin prices have rallied significantly, bitcoin network difficulty have also climbed ~20% since year-end, so HIVE may not see the full benefit of the rally in bitcoin prices (Figure 3). Figure 3 - Bitcoin prices and difficulty have climbed since end of 2022 (blockchain.com) In fact, in January, HIVE reportedly produced only 260 BTC, a decrease from 264 BTC in January 2022, despite bitcoin mining capacity increasing from 1.87 Exahash in January 2022 to 2.68 Exahash at January 31, 2023. Due to the constant increase in mining difficulty, bitcoin mining is like running on a treadmill, miners have to spend millions in capital just to stand still. Late Filing Adds Confusion To The Mix On February 14th, 2023, shareholders also got a Valentine's Day surprise when HIVE reported that due to a tax notice for one of its European subsidiaries, HIVE would not be able to file its interim financial statements by the regulatory deadline of February 14th, 2023. Fortunately, the company was able to release its financial results on February 21, 2023. However, reading the notes to the financial statements, we can see that the tax dispute on input VAT against equipment and other charges of SEK 338 million ($32 million) has not been resolved. While the company has filed formal appeals to the Swedish Tax Authority, there can be no guarantees that HIVE will prevail in recovering the VAT taxes. Altogether, the disputed VAT tax amounts to $4.6 million that the company currently includes in accounts receivables (Figure 4). Figure 4 - HIVE has $4.6 million in disputed VAT tax receivables (HIVE Q3/23 Financial Statements) Furthermore, if the ruling goes against HIVE, the company could be liable for the full amount plus other items such as penalties and interest. Why No Earnings Conference Call? In an age of transparency and accountability, it is notable that HIVE decided not to host a conference call after it released its Q3/2023 earnings report on February 21. This is especially galling as the company reported a huge $1.09 / share quarterly loss and shareholders were no doubt looking to management for direction and guidance towards future results. Perhaps the lack of an earnings conference call was to prevent analysts and investors from asking management tough questions? Pivot To 'AI' A New Source Of Growth? One interesting positive development in the quarter was the introduction in the earnings press release of language pertaining to 'high performance compute' (""HPC"") and 'AI' (author highlighted): Frank Holmes, HIVE’s Executive Chairman, stated “We wish to again thank our loyal shareholders for believing in our vision to mine both Ethereum and Bitcoin. We are sad to see the higher margin from mining Ethereum gone however our HPC strategy which has taken longer to roll out is now growing rapidly on a month over month basis. We are happy to share that our robust growth is scalable and could potentially increase 10x fold over the next year as the demand for our high quality chips due to the huge global demand for Ai projects like GPT CHAT, medical research, machine learning and rendering . Further, HIVE was the first to use our software to help balance the electrical grid and resell back energy whenever there is spike in demand. This strategy has been good for the community and HIVE. Even with a challenging quarter for the global digital asset ecosystem, where we saw the capitulation of crypto prices due to the implosion of FTX and the related contagion with other exchanges, lenders and hedge funds. Strategically, we have not borrowed expensive debt against our mining equipment or pledged our Bitcoins for costly loans, thus our balance sheet remains healthy to weather this storm. We believe our low coupon fixed debt; attractive green renewable energy prices and high performing energy efficient ASIC and GPU chips will help us navigate through this crypto winter. The most recent unexpected challenge has been in Sweden which we cover in greater detail in our interim filings.” As many investors are aware, 'AI' has been the hot topic in the past few months due to introduction of Chat GPT , a generative AI chatbot that has taken the public's imagination by storm (author's note, Hive appears to have mixed up Chat GPT's name in its press release above). The mere mention of 'AI' or 'Chat GPT' can cause small cap speculative stocks like C3.ai ( AI ) to rally 10-40% in a day, so it is not surprising that HIVE wants to be associated with the AI movement. However, it remains to be seen how applicable HIVE's GPU farms are towards real-world AI applications. According to the press release, HIVE will launch 'HIVE Performance Cloud' in calendar Q2 2023. Prior to the full-scale launch of HIVE Cloud, Hive's proof-of-concept test of its GPU fleet was able to produce annualized revenues of over $1 million doing high performance computing workloads. At current market conditions, HIVE estimates HPC is approximately 25x more profitable than mining bitcoin, on a dollar per MWHR basis. Enlisting approximately 450 GPUs, HIVE was able to produce $3,500 in revenue per day with 80 kW of power consumption. By comparison, 80 kW of Bitcoin ASIC miners would only produce approximately $175 per day of BTC. While those are gaudy numbers, investors are cautioned against counting their chickens before they hatch. In the HPC realm, HIVE will be competing against industry giants like Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, and Google's Cloud, not to mention dozens of dedicated competitors. It is unclear what advantage HIVE's GPUs have besides being idle. Let's wait until we see actual operational results from 'HIVE Cloud' before assigning any additional value to the GPU fleet. Risks To Bearish View Obviously, the biggest risk to being bearish HIVE is that even if one gets the fundamentals correct, one can still lose money. For example, even though the company has performed operationally exactly as I imagined in my November article, its stock price trajectory has been a different story. HIVE's stock first dropped from ~$2.50 to ~$1.40, then tripling to $4.20 in early January, before finally trading back to $2.50 in recent days (Figure 5). Figure 5 - HIVE is an extremely volatile stock (stockcharts.com) This is because HIVE trades much more on investors' sentiment towards bitcoin and risk appetite in general, rather than fundamentals. For traders who can time the markets, HIVE could be a great trading vehicle. However, for investors who want to invest in strong fundamentals, I would suggest they look elsewhere. Conclusion In summary, HIVE delivered exceptionally poor financial performance to close out calendar year 2022, as I had expected. Gross margins, which includes depreciation for mining equipment, fell to -117% in Q3/F23. HIVE also took $88 million in writedowns against its obsolete GPUs. Looking forward, I think HIVE's financials will see a relief bounce in Q4/F23, as bitcoin prices have rebounded in the past few months. However, investors should bear in mind bitcoin mining difficulty have increased, so the financial benefits may be less than what bitcoin prices suggest. One ray of hope for HIVE is its recent pivot towards 'high performance compute', which HIVE describes as being 25x more profitable than mining bitcoin. However, until we see some real financial results, I think investors should remain on the sidelines.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4583271-hive-pivoting-to-ai?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10132367.jpeg

Gox are about to recover some of their funds following a 10-year liquidation process, but concerns that large amounts of bitcoin (BTC) will be released onto the market are overdone, UBS said in a report Monday.  The “rehabilitation plan” gives creditors several options on how they are repaid and the timing of any repayment, the report said. The most important are whether to take an early lump sum or wait for more proceedings and further asset recoveries, and whether to receive the funds in fiat or crypto, the report added.  “The early lump-sum option with fiat repayments suggests that the exchange would have to sell BTC to raise the requisite cash,” strategists Ivan Kachkovski and James Malcolm wrote, noting the “long-held fear that Mt. Gox redemptions would hurt bitcoin’s price.”  While 850,000 bitcoins went missing from the exchange in 2014, it's not that amount that’s potentially being disposed of, because the exchange has recovered 142,000 BTC along with 143,000 in bitcoin cash (BCH) and 69 billion Japanese yen ($510 million), representing about 20% of the hack.  Still, the potential for the repayments to influence the price exists. That amount of bitcoin represents around 90% of average supply active within the last day and 28% in the last week. That’s significant because active supply increases are normally associated with weakness in the BTC price, the note said.  In reality, however, much less will come to market, as many early adopters are probably still crypto believers. Recent reports say two of the largest creditors, with a combined share of claims of 20%, have opted for the crypto payout, the bank said.  “New supply could still come to the market, but this at least implies it would be less concentrated,” it said. “Such news could have been an additional factor for BTC’s surprising resilience of late.”  Read more: Mt.

The rewards program lost over $13 million during the first three months of 2022 and lost $58 million for the whole year, according to the bankruptcy court filing published late Tuesday.  Voyager executives voiced concerns about a loss in providing users a high yield as part of the rewards program, the filing said.  “[I’m] trying to talk to Steve Ehrlich [Voyager’s co-founder and CEO] into taking BTC down to 4%,” Evan Psaropoulos, chief commercial officer at Voyager, is quoted as saying in the filing. “If we want to have that rate on bitcoin, we’d have to be open to strategies beyond basic lending. Or, we have to beef up the team and onboard/lend to riskier borrowers.”  The executives said they viewed the reward program cost as a marketing expense necessary for user acquisition, the filings say. In November 2021, the executives cited the reward and loyalty program as the mechanism that pushed Voyager over the 1 million account mark.  Court documents don't mention the other parts of the rewards program, aside from the high-yield accounts. Yields on Voyager were as high as 12% on certain digital assets.  Facing the significant cost of running the program, Voyager implemented a lending program to fund it. Counterparties for Voyager’s lending program included now-defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which presented Voyager with a one-page signed memo to show its net asset value.  In March, a number of U.S. states began to investigate the rewards program, accusing it of being an unregistered security.

Buhari’s term was plagued with nationwide riots to protest police brutality, rising inflation and in recent months, protests over cash shortages resulting from the complications of a plan to swap old banknotes for new ones. Buhari couldn't run again because of a two-term limit.  Opposition parties in the country have disputed Saturday's vote, which made Tinubu, who's from the same political party as Buhari, the leader of the West African nation.  The Central Bank of Nigeria, under Buhari’s administration, issued a digital naira in October 2021 to encourage electronic payments and rival private cryptocurrencies. Nigeria’s tech-savvy, young population made the nation one of the fastest crypto adopters in the world, despite attempts by the government to put a damper on use.  Uptake in the eNaira use has been slow, however, and even with the cash shortages, people haven't been turning to the digital currency, partly because so few merchants accept it as payment. Still, as the value of the naira continues to fall, demand for the U.S. dollar may have risen, as indicated by the black market exchange rates for the currency in Nigeria.  Under the Buhari administration, the central bank also prohibited local banks from offering services to crypto companies.  It’s unclear what the newcomer’s position on crypto is, but he plans to boost the country’s private sector to uplift an economy struggling with 21.8% inflation and fuel and cash shortages.

China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 52.6 in February, the highest in over a decade, following January's 50.1, according to data released on Wednesday. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion of activity. Non-manufacturing PMI rose to 56.3 from January's print of 54.4.  The positive news out of China, the world's factory and largest trading partner of the U.S. and Germany, pushed the U.S. dollar lower against major currencies, lifting risk assets like bitcoin and stocks higher.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value jumped 4% from $23,000 to nearly $24,000 before pulling back slightly to $23,700, according to CoinDesk data. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against majors, fell 0.5% to 104.36.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 4.15%, leading the risk-on recovery in Asian equity indices. Major European indices and futures tied to Wall Street's tech-heavy index Nasdaq also posted modest gains. Bitcoin is positively correlated to Nasdaq and stock markets, in general.  The cryptocurrency's early Wednesday bounce is consistent with the recent trend of Asian flows leading the market strength.  ""We note that ever since the November BTC bottom, BTC has seen a healthy and stable uptrend during Asian hours, with no notable downside days. Returns during the U.S. session have been more erratic, with the major rallies in January occurring during the U.S. trading session, whereas last week's rally occurred during European hours,"" Vetle Lunde, analyst at K33 Research said in a note published on Feb. 21.  The narrative in the market is that recent liquidity injections by the People's Bank of China are making up for the ongoing Federal Reserve tightening and keeping risk assets bid and the future of the crypto market now depends on developments in the East.  ""Liquidity continues to be a huge offset to the tightening in rates, predominantly coming from the East. China continues to pump cash to maintain adequate liquidity in the banking system and to spark economic growth post covid-zero,"" David Brickell, director of institutional sales at crypto liquidity network Paradigm, said in the Fed. 28 edition of Macro Pulse newsletter.  Hong Kong has recently warmed up to crypto, giving rise to speculation that, eventually, China would relax restrictions.

""With Hong Kong viewed as a trial ground for the mainland, the possibility for the vast sums of retail wealth to flow into crypto will maintain a positive sentiment offset to U.S.-driven FUD,"" Brickell noted.  From a technical analysis standpoint, a convincing move above February highs of around $25,000 is needed to strengthen the immediate bullish bias. The area around the said level capped the August bounce.

But even as the category pushes toward the $15 billion mark in total value locked, institutions in Asia are giving it a pass, according to crypto custodian Hex Trust.  Liquid staking allows users to retain the liquidity of their crypto while delegating it to network validators. Liquid staking is not decentralized, but it is protocol-based leading some to believe that it won’t attract the same regulatory scrutiny as centralized staking services.  “Institutional clients have not really been interested in liquid staking of assets. The only interest we have seen in such assets is when clients or the public cannot have access to the native staking of a particular token,” David Cicoria, head of markets technology, at the Asia-focused Hex Trust.  Cicoria points to some of the risks associated with liquid staking like depegging, risk of hacks, centralization concerns, and lack of regulatory clarity.  “Liquid staking protocols belong to decentralized finance (DeFi), and from a protocol or assets perspective are not considered as “securities” and the regulatory aspect seems far to warrant serious legal attention,” he said, pointing to guidance from the Securities and Futures Commission that these may constitute a “collective investment scheme.”  Native staking, which is also known as direct staking, is the form of staking that has garnered interest from institutional investors, according to Cicoria. But only as long as there’s actually technical staking going on behind the scenes, Cicoria added.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said that he is suspicious of intermediary-based staking platforms, telling the Wall Street Journal it “looks very similar – with some changes of labeling – to lending.” That may be reason why the SEC went after Kraken and not Coinbase, which on-chain data shows operates the larger staking pool.  Meanwhile, Hong Kong is firming out its crypto policy and looking to create a licensing regime for institutional and then retail investors, which may involve a framework around staking.

42414260,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB3RYq,1677665341,Crypto Lender Voyager Received Single-Page Value Statement From Hedge Fund Three Arrows Capital,"Just weeks before filing for bankruptcy protection, crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) sent lender Voyager Digital a one-page net asset value (NAV) statement, court documents filed Tuesday show. A single due-diligence call was conducted between the two firms. Voyager, which itself filed for bankruptcy protection in July, reported a $654 million loan to 3AC that accounted for almost 58% of its loan portfolio.  The document dated May 13, 2022, gave Three Arrows Capital's NAV as just under $2.4 billion. The fund filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in New York on July 1. The call took place Feb. 28, 2022, and lasted either 30 minutes, according to Voyager Chief Commercial Officer Jon Brosnahan, or an hour, according to Treasury Director Ryan Whooley.  The filings reveal the level of due diligence carried out by Voyager Digital with regard to Three Arrows Capital, whose failure sparked a wave of collapses among other crypto firms. Genesis Global Holdco, a CoinDesk sister company, reported that its Asia-Pacific unit had lent 3AC $2.4 billion in cash and digital assets. Crypto lender Celsius Network cited loans worth $75 million, and BlockFi also said it suffered “material losses” from the bankruptcy because 3AC was one of its largest borrowers.  ""The Voyager due diligence team did not have 3AC’s income statements, cash flow statements, or balance sheet. It did not do any stress testing of 3AC’s liquidity,"" the court documents say. ""During our interviews, numerous employees involved in due diligence (including Mr. Brosnahan and Mr. Whooley) told us that they did not have a background in credit risk evaluation.""  Under its proposed bankruptcy plan, Voyager's assets are up for sale to the U.S. wing of crypto exchange Binance, though this sale is subject to some scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Prior to the 1.14 release, core engineers were working on fixing problems that were impacting the network's speed and usability, such as invalid gas metering, lack of flow control for transactions, and lack of fee markets, among other more technical issues. These issues were prioritized to improve user experience.  But following the latest release, core engineers plan to bring in additional external developers and auditors to test and find exploits. They will also form an adversarial team comprising almost a third of the Solana Labs core engineering team.  The core engineers will continue supporting external core engineers, including Jump Crypto’s Firedancer team, which is building a second validator client.  Additionally, core engineers plan to improve the restart process by making nodes automatically discover the latest confirmed slot and share the ledger with each other if it is missing. Solana Labs and third-party core engineering teams have been working to improve the network over the past year, with a focus on stability.  “For example, Jump Crypto's Firedancer team is building a second validator client to increase the network's throughput, efficiency, and resiliency. Mango DAO developers are focused on the tooling needed to build on Solana,” Yakovenko said.  The comments came following a lengthy weekend outage for the Solana blockchain. The problems that started as sluggish transaction processing spiraled into a near-complete shutdown of activity on Solana. Developers said Monday the reason for a network-wide outage over the weekend was still unclear but investigations are ongoing.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/01/solana-will-improve-network-upgrades-to-improve-stability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f527c4fc6504ab51ad52b48aea7834c76166d33f-3886x2186.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Klaytn, a public blockchain platform developed by South Korean internet giant Kakao Corp., recently passed a governance proposal to burn nearly 50% of its token supply, a move that contributes towards making KLAY more valuable eventually.  In the road map, Klaytn said it would identify key crypto infrastructure services, such as decentralized oracles, where KLAY can be used to utilize said services, further increasing transactional utility and leading to more gas burns.  Oracles are a mechanism to connect smart contracts with the outside world, primarily to feed information from the world to a blockchain. Gas burns, also known as coin burnings, are when a project decides to take a certain number of coins out of circulation from the fees that blockchain generates on user transactions.  Klaytn will launch a permissionless network pilot in the second half of 2023 on its Cypress mainnet. This automates the entry and exit of validators, or entities of any blockchain and are responsible for verifying transactions on that network  On the governance front, some new initiatives include establishing community governance council selection and dismissal processes.  Klaytn will gradually transfer its decision-making authority to the community, allowing token holders users to have a say on who sits on Klaytn’s Governance Council (GC). The GC is a group of network participants that currently oversee governance of the Klaytn network.

Futures tied to Deribit's forward-looking bitcoin volatility index (DVOL) will be available to Deribit under the ticker BTCDVOL from the end of March, the exchange's chief commercial officer, Luuk Strijers, told CoinDesk on Wednesday.  DVOL, launched in early 2021, measures bitcoin's 30-day implied volatility calculated using Deribit's options order book. Implied volatility refers to the options market's expectation for price turbulence over a specific period.  Volatility trading involves betting on the future stability of an asset instead of taking a view on the direction of future price moves. Going long or buying volatility means betting the asset will see big moves in either direction.  Crypto traders have been using options strategies like straddle and strangle to express their views on volatility. However, these strategies are complex and require buying and selling options at various strike prices and high risk tolerance.  With the new offering, traders can bypass complexities involved in setting up options strategies and directly buy and sell volatility similar to trading futures tied to bitcoin's price. The product may attract more institutional and retail investor participation, much like the Chicago Board Options Exchange's (Cboe) VIX futures – derivatives on The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX. The index represents the market's expectation for volatility in the S&P 500 over the coming 30 days.  ""DVOL futures are an exciting new product that will allow traders to hedge their positions & general risk management, take advantage of market volatility, but also the alpha generation and portfolio diversification,"" Strijers said. ""This product is particularly useful for those who want exposure to BTC volatility but do not want to trade complex options strategies.""  Deribit users will initially get to trade only one-month expiry futures with the exchange planning to expand the offering to five expiries later.  The volatility futures will be linear and priced, margined and settled in Circle's U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC. Linear contracts offer a payoff that is related linearly to the spot price of the underlying asset.  Traders should note that DVOL futures, like other derivatives, are leveraged products that can amplify both gains and losses.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/01/crypto-options-exchange-deribit-announces-bitcoin-volatility-futures,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fee0bacd9fabee98898005dfbe4e5f8b64528004-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company reported a solid Q4, as it beat both revenue and earnings growth estimates, despite huge annual declines due to the lower crypto trading volume. Coinbase generated solid interest income from the assets held on its platform, which increased 79% Q/Q to $182 million in Q4 22. Its Subscription and Services revenue has also increased by 32.5% year over year to $282.8 million. Coinbase ( COIN ) is the second most popular crypto exchange in the world (by daily trading volume) and the most popular in the U.S. (see below table). Crypto Exchange Volume ( CoinMarketCap) The company has faced a tough time since crypto prices imploded in the first quarter of 2022, and went on a ""death spiral"" downwards, which was only exacerbated by the collapse of FTX (FTT-USD). However, Coinbase is actually still in a solid leadership position and the business has recently announced better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of 2022, beating both revenue and earnings growth estimates. In this post, I'm going to break down its recent quarterly results in granular detail, before diving into my valuation model and forecasts for the company. Let's dive in. Data by YCharts Mixed Fourth Quarter Results Coinbase reported mixed financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022. Its revenue was $605 million, which surprisingly increased by 5% quarter over quarter and was better than analyst expectations of $590 million, according to Refinitiv data. However, if we zoom out, the picture isn't so rosy. Its net revenue has actually declined by an eye-watering 75.7% year over year. Of course, management didn't include a revenue chart of this decline in its earnings report. Therefore many investors may have overlooked this, thus I have created a chart below. As you can see the peak in net revenue (Q4 '21) coincides with the peak in the price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) in November 2021, at ~$61,538 per Bitcoin. This was before the price of Bitcoin plummeted by 71.5%, by the end of Q4 '22. Coinbase net revenue (Created by author Deep Tech Insights) Of course, lower crypto prices doesn't need to mean less trading volume, but usually this has been the case for Coinbase and many crypto exchanges. Given the exchanges make their primary revenue from trading volume fees, the revenue hit is substantial. With total transaction revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 declining by 12% sequentially to $322 million. Investors seem to have felt the squeeze from the macroeconomic environment (high inflation and rising interest rates) and thus I believe there was a surge in panic selling initially. A negative for crypto is this does indicate the asset is not an ""inflation hedge"", as many people first assumed (but I will not be getting into that debate in this post). Many crypto investors have also decided to just ""hold"" or ""hodl"" (if you were a former meme stock trader) their crypto assets. Rising Interest Rate Benefits A positive for Coinbase is the company can still generate revenue from assets held on its platform through a combination of staking and also interest income. In this case, the company reported a solid 79% sequential increase in interest income to $182 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This was mainly driven by the rising interest rate environment, which enabled a net benefit on its $5 billion in customer fiat balances, despite the overall amount declining from $6.6 billion in the third quarter of 2022. Coinbase also offers a variety of programs related to the USDC (USDC-USD), which is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. In the fourth quarter, the company reported $2 billion in USDC on its platform, with $1.1 billion from retail consumers and ~$861 million from institutional or corporate customers. This offers its customers up to 1.5% annual percentage yield on balances held on the platform and Coinbase continued to scale its USDC rewards program internationally. Another positive for Coinbase is the company has continued to grow its subscription and services revenue by a solid 34% sequentially and 32.5% year over year. This was driven by growth in the Coinbase One program, as well as the aforementioned staking, with a particular benefit from the expansion of Ethereum 2 (ETH2) staking across Canada and Australia. Subscription and Services Revenue ( Q4 22 report) Trading Volume Breakdown On the table below, we can see a breakdown of trading volume by crypto type. It was interesting to see ""Other Crypto Assets"" have declined as a portion of total trading volume from 68% in Q4 '21 to just 33% to Q4 '22. I believe this makes a lot of sense and was likely a result of a decline in the number of speculative coins and new ICOs or initial coin offerings. In fact, data from Statista indicates the number of cryptocurrencies globally peaked at 10,397 in February 2022 and has now declined to 8,695 by February 2023. A positive is there has been a ""flight to safety"" toward the most well-known crypto assets Bitcoin and Ethereum, which made up 35% and 33% of crypto trading volume respectively. Trading Volume Crypto ( Q4 '22) Since late December to late February 2023, the price of Bitcoin has actually increased by over 45% and Ethereum by over 37%. Thus, this could be an indication the crypto market hit a ""bottom"" in November and December 2022, after the collapse of FTX and the negative news cycle surrounding its founder Sam Bankman Fried. Shark Tank investor Kevin O'Leary (who was also an FTX spokesperson who lost ~$10 million on the collapse) stated at the time that the situation may actually be a ""positive for crypto"", in an interview with CNBC. This is not so crazy as often it takes a disaster to increase industry regulations and consolidate a fragmented market. Given Coinbase is the leading U.S. crypto exchange, this could actually be a positive as it means less competition is likely to arise. Breaking down trading volume by customer type, Consumer (or retail trading) volume plummeted from $177 billion or 32% of the total volume in Q4 '21 to just $20 billion or just 13.79% of the total by Q4 '22. While Institutional Trading volume declined on a net basis, from $371 billion ( Q4 '21) to $125 billion by Q4 '22. However, institutional trading actually increased as a percentage of revenue from 67.8% in Q4 '21 to ~87% by Q4 '22. I believe this dynamic may actually be positive for Coinbase, as it shows the asset class is being taken more seriously by institutional funds (even despite the decline) and these investors look to be slightly less shaken by the volatility. It is also a testament to the technology and trust embedded inside the Coinbase platform as a U.S. based entity. In the third quarter of 2022, Coinbase was even selected by the world's largest asset manager BlackRock to provide crypto trading access to clients of its Aladdin (end-to-end investment platform). BlackRock has also previously added Bitcoin futures and derivatives to two of its investment funds. In January 2023, reports indicated BlackRock has added Bitcoin as an eligible investment into its Global Allocation Fund. In an interview at a New York Times event, following the implosion of FTX (of which BlackRock was also an investor), CEO Larry Fink stated that he believed ""most crypto companies won't be around"", but the collapse of FTX is ""not the end of De-Fi"". I tend to agree with this, as I believe we are currently seeing a consolidation of a previously fragmented industry and Coinbase is poised to cement its position. In the fourth quarter earnings call, management stated they had seen an ""elevated"" number of institutional investors onboarding onto its Coinbase Prime program. Consumer Institutional Investors ( Q4 '22 report) Margins and Expenses Coinbase has managed its expenses well in the fourth quarter of 2022. Total operating expenses were $1.184 billion which declined by 24.8% year over year, from the $1.576 billion reported in Q4 '21. This was primarily driven by lower transaction expenses (as less trading volume). However, as a percentage of revenue, this also declined from 20% in Q4 '21 to 14% by Q4 '22, which could be an indication of operating leverage improvements; thus, this is a positive for long-term profitability. Coinbase has also increased its investments in technology and development which have increased by 20.28% year over year to $590.1 million. This shows the company is still investing into the future and improving its technology and products, no matter what is happening in the crypto market. Some people may say this is risky and that the company should be cutting costs in all areas. However, many studies indicate those companies which tend to invest a large percentage of revenue into R&D tend to generate more shareholder value long-term. For example, Meta Platforms (META) has actually accelerated its R&D spend in the recent years, despite volatility with its core business. Management did admit that they ""hired too quickly"" during 2022 and reported a 24% increase in employee count to 4,510 by Q4 '21. A positive is management has begun to act fast and announced another round of layoffs on January 10th 2023, which would remove 950 employees from the company. Of course, this is not great for the employees (and team morale) and I feel bad for them. However, CEO Brian Armstrong believes this could help reduce operating expenses by 25% which is substantial. Operating Expenses ( Q4 '22 report) In Q4 '22, Coinbase reported an earnings per share [EPS] loss of $2.46, which was substantially worse than the $4 per share profit in Q4 '21. A positive is its Q4 '22 result did surpass analyst expectations which were expecting negative $2.55 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Its full-year net loss was a staggering $2.6 billion which included a substantial $694 million impairment in its ventures portfolio. Coinbase reported a solid balance sheet with $5.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the company reported $3.393 billion in long-term debt. Capital USD ( Q4 '22 report) Valuation and Forecasts Valuing Coinbase is extremely challenging given its future cash flows are widely dependent upon the future of cryptocurrency and the popularity of crypto trading. In this case, I have plugged its latest financial data into my discounted cash flow valuation model. In this case, I have forecast negative 5% revenue growth for the full year of 2023. I forecast this to be driven by the continued stagnation in crypto trading. However, I forecast this to be offset slightly by price momentum (given the recent increase in crypto prices), improved regulation, and continued growth in Coinbase's subscription revenue. In the Q4 earnings call, management didn't give overall revenue guidance but they did forecast continued growth in Subscription and Services revenue to between $300 million and $325 million in Q1 '23, as per the current trend. In years 2 to 5, I have forecast 15% revenue growth per year. This is fairly optimistic but driven by a favorable comparison to the poor 2022, as well as the aforementioned growth in interest income and subscription income. Crypto prices may also bounce back post-recession as ""risk capital"" flows back into more speculative assets, although this is unknown. Coinbase stock valuation 1 (Created by author Deep Tech Insights) To increase the accuracy of the model, I have capitalized the company's R&D expenses. In addition, I have forecast a pre-tax operating margin of 23% over the next 5 years. This is based upon improved business efficiency following the cost-cutting, as well as increased operating leverage for the business as a whole. Coinbase stock valuation 2 (Created by author Deep Tech Insights) Given these factors, I get a fair value of ~$55.69 per share, the stock is trading at ~$62 per share at the time of writing and thus is ~11.3% overvalued, according to my forecasts and model. A positive is the company trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio = 5.1, which is significantly cheaper than its P/S ratio in 2022 of over 17. Data by YCharts Risks Crypto May Not Bounce back/Recession The harsh reality is there is no guarantee crypto prices will bounce back, thus this is a risk for investors in COIN stock. A positive is the historic trend shows after previous crashes, crypto prices have bounced back. In addition, the infrastructure, partnerships, and crypto ""brand"" power is much stronger than during the 2017 bear market, even with the collapse of FTX. Final Thoughts Coinbase has continued to produce better-than-expected financial results, despite the ongoing ""crypto winter"". A positive is major bear markets often filter out the worst companies and leave the best still standing, think of Amazon rising after the dotcom bubble/crash of the year 2000. While many other e-commerce retailers (Pets.com etc.) went bankrupt. I believe we are seeing a similar situation in the crypto market, and the industry is consolidating which is a positive for Coinbase.

42414270,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB3SaW,1677634885,"Crypto Market February Roundup: Bitcoin Layer 2 Protocol Stacks, Ethereum Staking Derivative Tokens Surge","January euphoria in crypto markets turned to February worry as investors sent prices of most, major digital assets lower.  The retreat coincided with a cascade of concerning inflation and jobs data, starting with lukewarm consumer price index (CPI) data in the first half of the month and continuing with an alarming steadiness in jobless claims and an even more alarming rise in consumer spending. It also came amid a flurry of regulatory action in the U.S. that raised concerns about government agencies overreaching or misdirecting their efforts.  Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading flat from a month ago at about $23,080, although it was well down from its mid-February highs above $25,000 mark, according to CoinDesk data. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose about 40% in January.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market value, also traded sideways for the month to hover just over $1,600. ETH rose more than 30% in January.  With Ethereum’s upcoming Shanghai upgrade, markets’ interest in liquid staking derivatives soared, with LDO, the governance token of the decentralized autonomous organization behind liquid staking provider Lido surging 33% for the month. Its rival Rocket Pool’s native RPL token rose 18%.  “I think the narrative of ETH withdrawals and the Shanghai update that's coming made a lot of people worry that those wouldn't perform as well,” Katie Talati, head of research at crypto asset-management firm Arca, told CoinDesk. “But a lot of people have accrued revenue in fees that they've earned over this staking period.”  Winners  Bitcoin layer 2 protocol Stacks Network’s native STX token grabbed the biggest winner trophy among 160 assets in the CoinDesk Market Index, soaring 216% in February. The STX token started off the month hovering around 27 cents and climbed as high as 95 cents on Feb. 27 before retreating slightly.  The STX price surge coincided with market participants' growing interest in creating Ordinal non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are non-fungible tokens on bitcoin enabled by so-called inscriptions on Bitcoin’s mainnet.  Arca’s Talati said that the broader idea of improving the Bitcoin network’s scalability has been around since Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade – multiple signatures and transactions batched together for better privacy and scalability – in November 2021.  But she added: “More information has become available in the last few weeks in people buying and trading them more. A lot of people have been saying, ‘Well, if Ordinals do really well, this gives a reason for people to use the Bitcoin network, and therefore they'll have the need to use Stacks.'”  Talati noted that there’s still no marketplace or infrastructure for Bitcoin NFTs yet. “People are trading these Ordinals via over-the-counter [OTC] using spreadsheets for bids and asks.” she said.  Payment gateway Alchemy Pay (ACH) in the Currency sector was February’s second-largest winner, rising nearly $170%. Adventure gold (AGLD) and trueFi (TRU) jumped more than 50% during the month, according to CoinDesk Indices. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is up 3.3% for the month.  Losers  Gaming- and metaverse-affiliated tokens, which led January’s leaderboard, were among February’s biggest laggards. GMT, the native token of the STEPN ecosystem in the Culture and Entertainment sector, dipped 33% this month, while Gala Games' native GALA token, which surged 233% last month, dropped 28% in February.  Layer 1 network Aptos’ APT token, which surged 387% in January, dropped nearly 30% in February.  Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at crypto research firm Arcane Research, wrote in a weekly note that the recent ups and downs of tokens, saying that in three out of the last four weeks, the ""top 50 coin"" winner of the previous week has become the next week’s worst performer.  “Altcoin cycles tend to be short-lived, but this is beyond the norm and has all the hallmarks of a bored market chasing opportunities, in addition to no new capital inflows,” he wrote, adding: “Poor liquidity facilitates this erratic pattern, and you do not want to be the one holding the bag when the music ends.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/01/crypto-market-february-roundup-bitcoin-layer-2-protocol-stacks-ethereum-staking-derivative-tokens-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4f60da5dd0a3098279d42375ad2fa16a2353a14-4608x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  China Tokens Lead Declines  As Asia opened for business on the first day of March a number of China tokens were squarely in the red.  Web3 ecosystem token Neo, which is part of China’s national Blockchain Service Network, is down approximately 8%. Conflux’s CFX token, which is unique as its token is used by China dapp developers, is down 12.5%. Filecoin’s FIL token declined 5.5%.  Short interest on these tokens continues to build, according to data from CoinGlass. NEO is split down the middle between long and shorts, at 50.26% and 49.74% respectively, while CFX has dipped into majority short territory at 52.71%. Filecoin’s FIL, for its part, is nearly even.  Meanwhile, bitcoin and ether are also beginning the day in the red. Bitcoin is opening the business day in Asia at $23,141, down 1.3% while ether is at $1,607, down 1.4%.  CoinGlass data shows a nearly even split between longs and shorts for bitcoin and ether.  Traders might be looking to initial jobless claim numbers, scheduled to be released Thursday, for guidance.  At the same time, there’s still a concern about a lack of market liquidity causing stakeholders to be worried about everything from price swings to delayed token launches.  All eyes will be on bitcoin to see if it can push back and maintain $25,000, or if we are going back to $20,000.  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Loopring LRC −4.5% Smart Contract Platform Avalanche AVAX −4.3% Smart Contract Platform Decentraland MANA −4.0% Entertainment  Insights  NFTs' 'Digital First Sale' Problem  Like many things in crypto, the law hasn’t caught up to the speed at which the industry moves.  That includes copyright law.  Based on a current but outdated reading of the law, the entire secondary market for non-fungible tokens (NFT) is illegal. And the original creators of the NFTs could – based on how the law is currently understood – invalidate the entire secondary market.  All because of something called the ""first sale"" doctrine and the current lack of a digital counterpart.  Why is there no digital counterpart? Because the courts’ understanding of technology is stuck in the Napster era.  The disc is yours, the IP mine  Do you have a Blu-Ray copy of ""2001: A Space Odyssey""? Go ahead and sell it once you are done watching it. The disc is yours after all. But that same version downloaded from Amazon Prime’s store? You don’t own it. It’s not yours to sell.  This is the tricky world of the ‘first sale’doctrine, outlined in 17 U.S. Code § 109. The law holds that you can sell your property, even when it contains copyrighted intellectual property such as a Blu-Ray disc of a movie or even a painting.  But should that copyrighted material exist in digital form, such as a movie in file format, a video game from the Xbox Live Store or a monkey jpeg, this is where things get complicated – and illegal.  Why? Because courts think there’s no effective way to transfer a copyrighted digital file from one party to another while ensuring the original is deleted (therefore the file isn’t reproduced, rather than just transferred).  Writing in the Wake Forest University Journal of Business & Intellectual Property Law, Joshua Durham explores the intersection of NFTs and the principle of digital first sale, a legal framework that was heavily debated during the turn-of-the-century days of Napster but now is in need of an update.  Central to the debate over the digital Right of First Sale is the ""exhaustibility"" of files.  When you sell a Blu-Ray or a book to someone, they have the sole ability to enjoy it. But with computer files, there is no concept of ownership – you are simply given a license to use it – and courts haven’t gotten comfortable with confirming that a file is deleted on the first user’s computer. After all, files aren’t ""exhaustible""; they can be copied an infinite amount of times. Or in crypto parlance, 'double-spent.""  Durham highlights that the U.S. Copyright Office would not allow for a principle of “digital first sale” because it would have required a mechanism to ensure confirmation of the deletion of the sender’s copy or some form of automatic deletion.  This is why digitally purchased movies and games come wrapped in Digital Rights Management software that controls how you can use the file.  Around 2011, a firm called ReDigi tried to provide an online digital peer-to-peer marketplace that attempted to respect the first sale principle and take it into the digital era.  On ReDigi users would “forward and delete files.” There would never be two copies of the same file.  The courts didn’t like it, and found that it reproduced files and was thus an unauthorized reproduction, although the original was destroyed.  “Policymakers have concluded that since digital transmissions required reproducing a copy of a file (the work), digital transmissions infringed on the exclusive right of reproduction,” Durham writes. “A digital distribution of a reproduced copy was thus unlawfully made, and beyond the scope of the first sale doctrine.”  Double-spending and blockchain  But all of this seems a bit outdated for the blockchain era.  After all, blockchain’s key tenet is the prevention of double-spending. Or, to put it another way, you can’t reproduce a bitcoin or an NFT. Should you be able to do this then crypto wouldn’t have scarcity since it would be infinitely reproducible.  Double-spend attacks are a critical threat to blockchains and much is done to try and prevent them.  So for NFTs, there can’t ever be two of the same tokens. During a transfer of an NFT there’s no reproduction or transmission like there would be for ReDigi’s marketplace. There’s no infringement on the right of reproduction.  This is something that’s only possible with blockchain, before we were just sending copies of the file which wouldn’t qualify for protection under the first sale doctrine.  “Any unscrupulous NFT creator may invalidate all secondary sales of their NFTs through the outdated reading of § 109,” Durham writes.  After all, they didn’t authorize the sale. In a direct reading of the law, it would be similar to Apple going after someone selling copies of songs they have obtained from iTunes.  Of course, this isn’t going to happen. NFT creators expect, and almost always want, a lively secondary market.  But it’s a case of the law not catching up to the times. On one hand blockchain technology satisfies all the problems prior cases have identified with the nature of digital first sales. It’s just that there needs to be clarification from the courts, so there’s no monkey business.
