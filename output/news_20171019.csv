The company drew support from a number investors, including Network Society Ventures, Kalon Venture Partners, and startup accelerators BoostVC, Techstars and Powerhouse. Back in September 2016, Sun Exchange was one of a batch of blockchain startups to join the Plug 'n Play startup accelerator.  Sun Exchange's platform uses blockchain as a way to let users rent out solar panels, with assets being recorded on a blockchain and payments made through cryptocurrency.  In comments, the startup said that it aims to democratize access to solar power, as well as boost access for those looking to capitalize on interest in consumer-grade renewable energy.  Sun Exchange CEO Abraham Cambridge said in a statement:  ""[Solar power] is the fastest growing source of energy, but billions of people don’t own their own roof or have the capital to get it. By breaking down solar panel ownership to a single cell we reduce the cost of going solar by two orders of magnitude and we’re utilizing empty roof space in some of the sunniest cities on the planet, such as Dubai and Johannesburg.""  Though accelerators like BoostVC and Techstars are no strangers to investing in blockchain startups, the seed funding appears to be a first in the industry for both Network Society Ventures and the South Africa-based Kalon.

42427947,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4r1h,1508444645,Is Blockchain Worth the Trouble? Blythe Masters (and More) Say Yes at Sibos,"Building with blockchain is tough – for every problem the tech promises to solve, it seems another pops up.  But if you take the advice of former JPMorgan Chase executive and Digital Asset CEO Blythe Masters, it's worth all the fuss. Speaking on a panel today at Swift's annual Sibos conference in Toronto, Masters emerged from a relatively silent period with a defense of the technology.  Masters told the audience:  ""I don't think blockchain solutions inherently introduce risks, and in some cases they may inherently mitigate them.""  But integrating blockchain for its myriad of benefits – including faster settlement times and greater data transparency – is an expensive endeavor. DAH, in particular, has raised $107 million in funding so far to expand the startup's blockchain solution, which it is working to integrate into the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), the country's largest stock exchange.  As such, Masters' comments set the stage for what would be a nuanced discussion about how real blockchain applications deal with the two key pain points: security and compliance.  ""It's not as simple as just introducing new tech,"" said Ikuma Ueno, head of blockchain and DLT at Japan's Mizuho Financial Group.  Handling the keys  As put forward by the panel, the questions that typically arise when building blockchain solutions tend to focus on the management of cryptographic keys that give users access to the ledger.  But Masters, instead of viewing this as an obstacle for distributed ledger implementations, positioned it as part of a larger threat against the way cryptographic keys are handled in today's centralized infrastructures.  ""The propagation of higher standards of key management for the enterprise is something everyone knows they have to do anyway, and it has absolutely nothing to do with blockchain,"" said Masters, adding:  ""In some ways, the blockchain evolution or revolution is helping advance that. It's brought R&D to this area that's been constructive.""  Echoing Masters' statements, Tom Jessop, the president of blockchain startup Chain, argued blockchain technology is proving helpful in eliminating the ""honeypots"" of data that lure attackers to centralized systems. And that in itself makes the cost of blockchain worth the future savings.  Large financial institutions seem to agree. Jessop's startup Chain has built live blockchain solutions for both Citi and Nasdaq, and has secured $43.7 million in funding.  He continued, saying blockchain's append-only data structure minimizes the chances of fraud as well.  Compliance as security  But, Jessop went on to argue that security isn't as big of a cost obstacle for blockchain projects as compliance costs are. ""Security is very important,"" he said, ""but it's not of first-order importance.""  The global bank representatives on the panel – Mizuho Financial Group's Ueno and Alicia Pertusa, the head of corporate and investment banking at BBVA, which is working on its own blockchain foreign exchange pilot – agreed saying that working with regulators and standards bodies should be a focus for those implementing blockchain.  But even that hurdle can, and should be, overcome. For instance, Ueno has already had success with this, working with Japan's financial regulators to change the country's requirement that bills of lading must be paper.  While regulators might not typically be thought of as a security feature, the sentiment was struck unanimously among the panelists. Because regulators craft rules to protect consumers and the financial system against fraud and malfeasance, working within their guidelines can protect companies from vulnerabilities they might have otherwise missed.  In summary, the chief information officer of foreign exchange technology provider CLS, Thomas Zschach, affirmed the importance of working with regulators to ensure that the potential risks of working with blockchain do not outweigh the benefits.  Zschach concluded:  ""They want assurances because that's their job. They want to make sure the global financial infrastructure remains stable.""

42427940,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4qlh,1508443200,Sweden's Government Sold Bitcoin Today At Above Market Rates,"The Swedish government has successfully auctioned off some bitcoin, collecting more than the prevailing market rate in the sale.  The 0.6 BTC – along with an equal amount of bitcoin cash, which was not previously dsiclosed – were sold by the Kronofogden during a week-long auction for a total of 43,000 kroner, equal to roughly $6,841 at press time.  When the auction was first announced last Thursday, the BTC up for grabs was valued at about $3,200. Bitcoin cash, according to CoinMarketCap, is currently trading at around $330.  According to Digital Di, Sweden’s largest digital news organization, the identity of the winning bidder isn't immediately known, nor has the Kronofogden issued an official statement marking the conclusion of the auction.  The auction's unveiling last week was a notable one, given that the Kronofogden – which acts as a kind of debt collection agency – had acquired the cryptocurrency holdings as part of its official duties. According to Di Digital, one of the other bidders, a member of the day-trading podcast Borspodden confirmed they participated but said they did not win the auction.  Kronofogden is not the first government agency to sell seized bitcoin. Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Justice formally took possession of $48 million it accrued through the sale of 144,336 bitcoins since the closure of the Silk Road dark market.  At the press-time price of about $5,650, those holdings would be worth more than $800 million.

During his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, Sessions – a former U.S. senator himself – highlighted the use of bitcoin in response to a question by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) about dark markets, or online marketplaces  Sessions told the committee:  “[Dark web users] use bitcoins and other untraceable financial capabilities and it is a big problem.”  In his remarks, Sessions referred to the closure of two dark markets, including previous ecosystem leader AlphaBay, following a crackdown by US authorities. Sessions claimed that AlphaBay's client base constituted ""240,000 accounts where individuals were selling for the most part illegal substances and guns, including fentanyl.""  Law enforcement officials have long expressed concern about the use of cryptocurrencies by dark markets, arguing that they obscure the paper trail that investigators might follow. Agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation have targeted this use case when seeking funds to bolster their cybercrime efforts, a trend that arguably began in the wake of the closure of the Silk Road, once the world's top dark market.  Sessions' appearance yesterday also led to indications that Congress may take up specific measures related to dark markets.  In her remarks, Sen. Feinstein stated that she would like to work with Sessions and the Justice Department on issues surrounding the dark web, potentially through legislation or alternative actions.

In an Oct. 16 note to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, inspector general Eric Thorson outlined a range of ""management and performance challenges"" that he anticipates will effect the Treasury Department in the coming months and years.  Among those, he wrote, are the issues facing the U.S. Mint – (which produces and circulates coinage) and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) (the office responsible for designing Federal Reserve notes and other government-backed securities) related to new payment methods like cryptocurrency. And while Thorson didn't sound the alarm on any immediate threats, he urged the two agencies to look at the long-term effect such ""technological advances"" could pose to their business models.  He wrote:  ""In addition, BEP and the Mint need to consider the effect of alternative payment methods and other technological advances (such as stored value cards, the Internet, smartphones, and virtual currencies) as well as consumer demand on their respective business models, practices, future planning and interactions with their customers, and the Federal Reserve Bank.""  The subject of cryptocurrencies was raised elsewhere in the memo, in reference to the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which is one of agency that oversees exchanges in the US.  According to the note, the cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem remains an ""area of concern"" for the US Treasury.  ""Other areas of concern for FinCEN include the increasing use of (1) mobile banking, internet banking, internet gaming, and peer-to-peer transactions; and (2) money service businesses, including virtual currency administrators and exchanges,"" Thorson wrote.

DOVU told CoinDesk that it had raised a total of 20,000 ethers, an amount worth approximately $6.2 million at press time. The token sale was divided in two parts, including a pre-sale and a public sale that concluded on Tuesday.  The startup had previously received an investment from InMotion Ventures, Jaguar Land Rover's investment outfit. Creative England, a fund backed by the U.K. government, also bought an undisclosed stake in the firm.  DOVU is aiming to build a platform through which users will voluntarily submit data (from traffic reports to weather conditions) and be rewarded through the distribution of the ""DOV"" tokens. The idea is that the token will act as an incentive for getting more information on the platform, which can then be sent to connected devices and other entities that are using the network for up-to-date transport data.  In statements, the company said that the ICO is ""the beginning"" of a longer process to come, with the funding being devoted in part to building out the existing DOVU team.  ""Over the course of the next few months we’ll be announcing exciting partnerships and protocol developments. We’re going the hire the best blockchain talent, so if that’s you, reach out. Now the hard work starts,"" said Irfon Watkins, DOVU's CEO.  As shown by CoinDesk data, the blockchain use case has seen growing interest since the start of the year.

Although bitcoin is still the most dominant coin, a plethora of niche coins have emerged in the market, creating sub-economies within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. eSports’ ERT is a great example of how it is possible to develop such a niche coin that can become the pillar of an emerging industry. The advantage now is that after the advent of the bitcoin economy, it will take ERT a fraction of the time to develop an economy around it. This is due to the fact that it was designed with a specific set of goals in mind, and it plays a specific role within cryptocurrency markets.

If a token such as the ERT allows specific customers that are identified with the gaming industry, to get better deals and bespoke products and services, then the economy will enter a whole new era by going deeper down the cryptocurrency rabbit hole. Imagine the following: Gamers start buying gaming related products with ERT tokens, such as gaming PCs, or perhaps special mice and keyboards. The producer of these goods will have an incentive to market and retail within the eSports platform, which will allow them to spend less on marketing and distribution efforts through other platforms.

42380028,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LXgV,1508416232,"Cautiously Bullish? $6,000 in Play as Bitcoin Price Stages Sharp Recovery","Having witnessed a solid recovery from the low of $5,100 in the last 24 hours, bitcoin is once again trading on the front foot and looking northwards.  At press time, the bitcoin-US dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate was roughly $5,700. As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has gained 6.47 percent in the last 24 hours. Week-on-week, BTC is up 4.77 percent, and on a monthly basis, it is carrying 45.7 percent gains.  So, is the bitcoin price eyeing $6,000? Strong dip demand would seem to suggest so.  The drop to $5,100 witnessed yesterday turned out to be healthy correction as expected, and the subsequent 'V' shaped recovery could be taken as an indication cash is waiting on the sidelines for a good opportunity. Further, the potential (or perceived) benefits of holding bitcoin ahead of the hard fork in November could also bring in more buyers, leading to higher prices.  However, short-term overbought technical conditions persist. Therefore, the price action analysis suggests there is merit in being 'cautiously bullish' on bitcoin.  Daily chart  The above chart shows:  Wednesday's candle was a 'Dragonfly Doji.'  The relative strength index is still overbought.  Higher lows pattern (as indicated by a rising trend line & Wednesday's sharp rebound from $5,100) is still intact.  View  'Dragonfly Doji' is candlestick pattern with a long lower shadow (also known as long wick or long tail or long leg) and without a real body and upper shadow. The long tail indicates dip demand, while the dragonfly doji indicates indecision among traders.  In this case, the price action on the following day generally decides the short-term outlook. The fact that bitcoin is well bid today indicates the bulls have been able to carry forward the strong move from the low of $5,100. Thus, prices may jump above $6,000 if the bid tone remains intact over the next few hours.  On the other hand, a negative price action today would confirm a bearish doji reversal. A bullish-to-bearish trend change is likely only below $5,000 (rising trend line support).

42379991,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LXfF,1508414406,Odd Bedfellows? Blockchain Developers Can Learn to Love the World Bank,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  In this opinion piece, one of a weekly series of columns, Casey assess the unorthodox role that multilateral organizations can play in developing blockchain technology.  At first glance, the World Bank looks like an ill-suited partner for any self-respecting blockchain developer intent on disrupting the financial order.  This isn't just a bank, it's one that’s owned by the world's governments. It would seem the very embodiment of the centralized third party that Satoshi Nakamoto sought to disrupt.  But working with the World Bank's new Blockchain Lab offers more opportunities for change than it sounds. And the bank is not the only strange bedfellow within the international community that blockchain innovators should be making. The International Monetary Fund also wants to collaborate. So, too, do many U.N. agencies.  Multilateral organizations are warming to blockchain technology, driven by a belief that reducing the economic rents charged by trusted intermediaries can advance social-impact goals such as financial inclusion. Serious crypto developers should seize a chance to jointly promote decentralizing, open-source applications before corporate interests beat them to it with more centralized solutions.  'Massive disruptions'  During last week's IMF and World Bank annual general meetings in Washington, blockchain technology was a hot topic. In separate CNBC interviews on the sidelines, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said it is ""something that everyone’s excited about"" and IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde predicted that digital currencies would soon unleash ""massive disruptions.""  Such comments mean nothing without commitments. So it's heartening to see both international financial institutions, as well as some of their smaller siblings such as the Inter-American Development Bank, ramping up resources and creating research partnerships.  Perhaps the most unlikely convert is the United Nations, where various agencies are now engaged in blockchain pilots. Bernhard Kowatsch, who heads the innovation accelerator at the U.N.'s World Food Program, says a test of an ethereum-based system for tracking cash disbursements, payments and food distribution to 5,000 Syrian refugees produced such resounding efficiency gains that it will soon be rolled out to a further 100,000 refugees in Jordan.  It's understandable that developers intent on disintermediating business processes might be wary of these giant entities. They helped perpetuate a 20th-century political-economic model dominated by centralized government and corporate institutions. And they are run by hulking bureaucracies whose members are as interested in self-preservation as those of any incumbent organization. ""Innovation"" isn't a word one associates with the World Bank.  Interests aligned  Still, in some ways, the interests of the staff of these international agencies are more closely aligned with those of the crypto community than those of national governments and established companies. Having neither taxation nor profit-seeking capacity, they too often find themselves as outsiders in global capitalism's battles for economic and political supremacy. Yet they do retain enough clout to influence certain governments and with which they could foment the kind of policy environment that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology need.  Socially motivated crypto people can also find common ground with these organizations’ mission statements. The World Bank has a mandate to reduce poverty, a part of which is its ambitious goal of universal financial inclusion by 2020. The U.N. is all about its SDGs – Sustainable Development Goals – for 2030. It's tempting to see these as hollow slogans, but the positive branding gives social impact-focused blockchain innovators something with which to hold these institutions to account.  The international financial institutions (IFIs) have their own motives to change, too. With the U.S. backpedalling from its substantial international commitments, they are forced to do more with less. It's one reason agencies are looking to disruptive technologies to extract new efficiencies.  There's even a subtle but healthy strain of quiet subversion among this new breed of blockchain enthusiasts, a desire to reform their institutions from within.  When Yoshiyuki Yamamoto, a veteran employee of the U.N.'s Office for Project Services, wanted to launch a blockchain initiative, he knew that creating a formalized U.N. unit would get bogged down in a bureaucratic no-man's land. So he unilaterally created the UN-blockchain.org website – the homepage of which opens by comparing Satoshi Nakamoto to John Lennon – and invited U.N. staffers from any agency anywhere to reach out if they were interested in exploring pilots.  Within a few months, he had attracted an ad-hoc group of more than 75 staffers from seven separate agencies. Many are now engaged in blockchain research, including with government partners. Yamamoto had created something remarkable: a distributed organization inside the ultimate centralized bureaucracy.  Of course, the governments that fund them can and do constrain these institutions' ability to push for disruptive solutions. That's especially so when the disruption is targeted at politically connected businesses. But their influence over policymakers is not insignificant either, and innovation partners can exploit that. After all, the regulation environment can be a major determinant of whether a blockchain venture succeeds.  Influence over policy  While the IFIs have no sway over big shareholder governments like the U.S, that's not the case with emerging-market countries, where they can place conditions on funds disbursement.  That's not without controversy, of course. The IMF and World Bank's role in promoting ""Washington Consensus"" free-market policies drew the ire of many in the post-Cold War era, when they were viewed as agents of the U.S. (With a 17.46 percent stake in the IMF, the U.S. holds unique veto power over the IMF's policymaking, which is based on 85 percent majority voting.)  But, for now at least, the U.S. is agnostic on how blockchain technology is deployed. That creates a window of opportunity for these organizations' blockchain labs to autonomously make a difference. And because of their mandate for social good, they can act as honest brokers on behalf of their innovation partners. When World Food Program staffers explore blockchain technology to improve food supply chains, they are not doing so to maximize profits, protect entrenched interests, or further Washington's geopolitical agenda. They're driven by a need to deliver sufficiently safe food to 80 million people worldwide.  There are no assurances these institutions will promote the principles of open-access and permissionless innovation, however. And without that, they could sell this technology short. Banks and other large corporations, smelling dollars, are courting them with promises of permissioned blockchains run by familiar names and centralized payment solutions. These offer short-term solutions to the scalability challenges of public blockchains but ultimately reinforce old economic power structures.  So it was good to see the value of public blockchains recognized during a summit on Friday that the World Bank co-hosted with the Blockchain Trust Accelerator. The event, held at the New America Foundation, highlighted bitcoin infrastructure provider BitFury's work registering land titles in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. The Georgian government's support for that project, in which a snapshot of the national land registry is periodically hashed to the bitcoin blockchain, is an encouraging endorsement of the permissionless model. Ukraine is now pursuing a similar arrangement with BitFury.  Using that experience as a model, the World Bank and other international institutions can play an influential role steering other governments to support this approach.  Well-intended or not, the Washington Consensus failed because it was built on the old, centralized organizational structures of the 20thcentury. Now, these centralized behemoths, the offspring of that world, are in a unique and ironic position. They can help us forge a 21st-century economic model that's based on decentralization, open access and a level playing field on which all get to compete.

Following the passing of new legislation in the country's parliament today, the long controversial ""double taxation"" of cryptocurrencies – first when buying it, then later when buying items subject to the tax – is finally coming to an end.  The situation arose from the previous law, enacted in 2014, which treated cryptocurrencies as bartered goods for GST purposes – legislation that quickly received criticism from technology advocates, and last year saw pledges from government officials to rectify the issue.  The Australian Senate Economics References Committee proposed a review of the situation this August, and the Treasury Department first set out new legislation to resolve the issue in May's budget.

The move comes amidst a larger, international conversation about the tax treatment of blockchain-enabled assets, and the various approaches regulators can (or should) take.

42379986,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LXaD,1508407209,"Blockchain of the Vanities? Sibos, Swell and Stellar Troll in Toronto","So much for collaboration...  In the latest sign that the blockchain sector has reached peak hubris, two much-anticipated conferences devolved this week into what can only be described as elaborate trolling.  But for those following the run-up to the events, the result is unlikely to be a surprise. When distributed ledger startup Ripple announced it would host an event called Swell, aimed at uniting financial leaders to discuss trends and strategies, it was hardly coy about its intent.  What might have seemed pretty innocent on the surface showed its true colors when Ripple decided to have the event in the same city, on the same days as Sibos, the flagship annual conference that its incumbent competitor has been putting on since 1978.  As a result, the city of Toronto played host to an all-out grab for attention, one where none of the players involved were willing to let the others have their day. But, the publicity did have its benefits, and it does seem to have favored the startups if attendees are any indication.  ""It's more fun over here,"" one Swell attendee said to another, both of whom had passes to attend Sibos.  Even onstage attendees and online commentators were forced to recognize the situation.  When Swift CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt poked fun at Ripple, describing one of his initiatives as ""not a swell, but a tsunami,"" Ripple's chief technology officer Stefan Thomas sent it right back on Twitter, retorting:  ""To the future victims of @SWIFT's 'tsunami' - @Ripple will be here to help rebuild.""  But in other ways, Ripple's PR offensive didn't work.  For one, big-budget keynotes, such as those for the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee didn't fill the room (former Fed chief Ben Bernanke's keynote was standing room only, though). Of course, that may be because speakers didn't exactly choose sides (prior to his appearance at Swell, Berners-Lee had been reportedly spotted at Sibos).  If all that wasn't enough, the move also sparked another form of boycott, with one of Ripple's own industry-specific competitors using the event as a platform for attention-seeking.  On Monday, Stellar came out of hiding, announcing a partnership with IBM in which the incumbent tech company revealed it is settling real transactions with Stellar's native cryptocurrency.  Not to stop there, on Tuesday night, Stellar founder Jed McCaleb (who has had a longstanding beef with Ripple executives) spoke about his protocol to about 100 people at a local bitcoin enthusiast group Bitcoin Bay's MeetUp.  A game of trolls?  If you're looking for winners, though, the sad truth is no one wins in a game of trolling at this scale. Rather attendees were perhaps given more one-sided content in two (or three) different ways.  Protest events notwithstanding, financial incumbent Swift remains a powerhouse, and it used its event to herald its own blockchain solution for moving money in nostro-vostro accounts.  The same could largely be said about Swell – where panels mainly focused on enterprise use cases for Ripple tech. Swell may have been unique, however, in the sheer emphasis it put on the idea that there is a competition to be had between the two camps.  For example, a number of financial institutions used the Swell stage to laud blockchain (and Ripple's platform specifically) for being an easier way to transact cross-border than Swift.  On day one, Marwan Forzley, CEO and co-founder of business-to-business payments provider Veem, was keen to stress that blockchain allows cross-border transactions to move in real-time (unlike the incumbent's generally slower payment mechanisms).  ""The [blockchain] environment is very useful in markets like the Philippines,"" he said, pointing to the currencies outside the G10 (those that are the most liquid and heavily-traded).  Day two of Swell was more of the same, with a handful of Ripple's clients – including Banco Santander, SBI Remit, Nordic bank SEB and India's Yes Bank – speaking about the protocol's benefits.  For instance, Banco Santander's blockchain innovation lead Richard Bell talked about his company's pilot Ripple iOS app, which allowed the bank's employees to pay in British pounds when the merchant wanted to accept euros or U.S. dollars.  ""Very quickly our employees were using this application for mission-critical things, like mortgages on homes in other countries and … speeding fines,"" Bell said.  The catch  Of course, all of this actually ended up exposing similarities between the providers.  With more than 100 clients, Ripple may be well on its way toward becoming a competitor to the legacy financial payments system, but it also must work with it to get there.  Even Stellar's McCaleb acknowledged the importance of getting legacy partners to the effort of growing the use of distributed ledger systems, telling his meetup attendees:  ""Everytime we get a financial institution to use the network, it's easier to get more financial institutions to use it too.""  This line of thinking was perhaps best on display during the last panel at Swell, which likely packed the room because ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin was onstage (also speaking were Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf, Chain president Tom Jessop and Ripple's Thomas).  But, all the panelists conceded that right now, it's too early to compete to the death.  While Buterin built (and continues to build) what he calls a general-purpose blockchain, he also said that there's no right answer for every use case. Sometimes private blockchains work best, other times a public blockchain is necessary, and in other cases, a hybrid approach is the only route, he said.  ""We are building the new financial world and some parts of the new internet,"" Buterin said, adding in that way, it's more about competing over ideas, instead of with people and companies.  Plus, sometimes, it's hard to tell whether blockchain companies know who their competition really is.  In response to a question about Swift, Behlendorf came to the incumbent's aid, saying, ""Well first, you have to understand what Swift is. They're a co-op ... and they don't help their shareholders by charging exorbitant rent. It's pretty cheap.""  He continued:  ""For [Swift] it's about getting payments down from T-2 days to T-5 minutes ... so they're in a perfect position to adopt blockchain.""  Even Thomas, taking inspiration from the blockchain interoperability play Interledger Protocol where he devotes much of his time, was more reserved during the panel when it came to dissing the competition.  This was true for other Ripple executives as well. On Wednesday, the last day of Swell, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse reflected on Tuesday's closing panel, clarifying that what's good for his company, is generally good for everyone in the ecosystem.  He concluded:  ""I want all boats to rise.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has ownership stakes in Chain and Ripple.

42379985,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LXYx,1508403656,Bank of America Seeks Patent for Blockchain Processing System,"Bank of America is exploring how it might use a blockchain to better track the processing of file transfers in real time.  The proposed system, outlined in a pair of patent applications recently released by the US Patent and Trademark Office, detail a system by which a blockchain could be combined with communications and memory devices to simplify the data processing process.  As put forward in the filings, current systems require middleware to work, and have a large number of memory, resource and time requirements. At the same time, the data's status during processing cannot be tracked, due to these memory requirements.  Instead, the bank proposes using a blockchain to transfer large volumes of data more quickly, while simultaneously tracking the data using cryptographic keys as packets are transferred.  The system aims to use a tblockchain to handle two types of data processing: the actual data transfer itself, as well as a log of the cryptographic keys that identify each data packet and its current processing stage.  According to the applications:  ""The present invention is directed to providing a novel technical solution that reduces transactional and informational complexities and transforms the processing of electronic files and management of data contained within such files.""  All in all, the patents are the latest that find the U.S. banking giant continuing to build a portfolio of protected blockchain uses. As of August, Bank of America has filed for more than 20 patents related to blockchain or cryptocurrency since 2014.

42379987,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LXcj,1508400044,"Blockchain Forks Are All the Rage, But Can They Ever Be Safe?","Hard forks have earned a bit of a bad name.  Long portrayed as dangerous (or at least disruptive), the mechanism is also one of the more intuitive for upgrading blockchains. Quite simply, since blockchains are built on common rules, it can seem like the easiest way to improve them is to introduce new rules (or change existing ones) – and that's exactly what hard forks, one type of a wider variety of forks, seek to do.  But as developers have learned the hard way, executing them is a challenge.  So, while best practices have come a long way since a hard fork unexpectedly split ethereum's blockchain in two last summer, developers are still seeking a better understanding of the process, studying its nuances and testing how to execute safely.  That said, not all blockchains struggle with the transition. The anonymous cryptocurrency monero carries out hard forks on a regular schedule and even cryptocurrency developers who some view as more conservative agree the mechanism might have a place in the future.  Bitcoin cash, for example, successfully split off from bitcoin in August, with relatively few problems for the network's many users. Now, at least two bitcoin hard forks are on the way – both of which will take place in the next two months.  But while hard forks are growing more common, developers haven't stopped debating under what conditions they are safest to use – and how to mitigate their less-than-desirable side effects.  In ethereum's case last year, users and companies lost money because of the resulting ""replay attacks"" that exploited the sudden creation of two chains.  So, with demand for the mechanism increasing, developers from across the ecosystem are working to make hard forks smoother and safer, in an effort to ensure that users don't lose any funds or faith in the networks that protect them.  Protecting money  One issue is that the ""right"" way to execute a hard fork isn't so cut and dry.  The problem is that when a blockchain splits in two, users – and the software they use – can get confused about which cryptocurrency to follow. One example of this confusion is referred to as a ""replay attack,"" where users can accidentally send cryptocurrencies on two blockchains when they only meant to send funds on one.  Bitcoin cash, bitcoin's first hard fork in August, made a change that protects against this problem and bitcoin gold, another upcoming hard fork with goals opposite to bitcoin cash, claims it will add replay protection also.  Still, different developers have different ideas of the best way to deal with these attacks. The developers behind Segwit2x, perhaps the best-known proposed hard fork (since it's garnered support from many bitcoin industry leaders), have flipped back and forth on the topic.  Developers behind the controversial proposal maintain that the hard fork will become the new bitcoin and that implementing protection would deter the project since users will have to take the extra step to upgrade their software.  Post-fork confusion  Meanwhile, others argue that adding protection against replay attacks will ensure users don't get confused and accidentally lose money.  BitGo engineer Mark Erhardt (aka Murch) explained that since bitcoin cash is a copy of bitcoin in many ways, it uses the same address format. Since the addresses are of the same type, it's possible to send bitcoin between the two networks, where they then get stuck.  Murch, who leads moderation of Bitcoin Stack Exchange, an active forum to ask technical questions about the protocol, mentioned that he's seen ""numerous questions"" about this issue from users who accidentally sent funds to the wrong network.  If users send bitcoin cash to a bitcoin address, it's possible to recover funds by importing the corresponding bitcoin private key into a bitcoin cash wallet. On the other hand, if a bitcoin cash user sends bitcoin cash to a bitcoin SegWit address, it might be ""lost altogether,"" he said.  Murch said that he thinks this confusion with bitcoin cash is a sign of what could come in future hard forks, like the one in November.  ""There will be numerous incidents of users sending funds accidentally on both chains or from addresses of one chain to the other,"" he told CoinDesk, adding that one way to get rid of this problem would be for future forks to use a different address format.  ""I am expecting a significant increase in support requests,"" he added.  Governance questions  Still, what's been less discussed is that there might be a way of wiping this attack vector away entirely.  Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr recently reintroduced a proposal that would make bitcoin naturally resistant to replay attacks, ""hopefully ending the whole argument,"" he wrote.  This sort of development takes time, though, and will require a couple of different changes to bitcoin.  Dashjr told CoinDesk that he thinks the change is ""not likely"" to be implemented in time for the Segwit2x fork in November, although it might be implemented some day in the future. At least, if the bitcoin hard forks continue.  Then there are also broader governance questions and concerns.  You could say that this makes up the bulk of the argument around Segwit2x, as each side frames the debate as a power struggle for control of the technical direction of bitcoin. And there is a broader worry that hard forks could make certain groups more influential in systems where no one is supposed to have power.  These questions came to light in recent discussions among developers of MimbleWimble, as its developers plan to finally put its novel cryptographic tricks into practice by launching a new blockchain next year.  In the early stages, the developers are still working out the code and cryptography, so they are mulling over the idea of allowing hard forks for a short grace period, as a safeguard against unexpected technical problems that might pop up soon after the launch.  ""We're a young project and we may make mistakes both with technical and governance rules,"" MimbleWimble lead developer Igno Peverell told CoinDesk.  The developer suggested a novel approach, though: putting an end to the upgrading mechanism after two years.  Some were skeptical of the idea. Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra, one of the earliest MimbleWimble advocates, argued that hard forks pose a ""centralization"" risk and there's ""rarely a need"" to use one.  After expressing those concerns, though, he hinted that the best approach might not be so black-and-white, seeming open to the idea of limiting developers' ability to execute the type of upgrade to a shorter time frame.  He wrote:  ""I like the idea of being clear upfront that the 'early days' won't last forever.""
