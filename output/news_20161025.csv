42427110,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPVh,1477432258,Civic Demos Vision for Blockchain Web Login Service,"Civic CEO Vinny Lingham isn't someone you'd be likely to identify as quiet.  Yet, since its launch in January, the outspoken founder of the Palo Alto identity startup has been tight-lipped about his new venture, the follow up to mobile gift card service Gyft (which was sold to First Data in mid-2014). That changed today as Lingham previewed a new use case for the service today to a crowd at the Money2020 conference in Las Vegas.  First described as a digital identity protection startup, Lingham showcased how users who provide Civic with information such as their Social Security number and home address can now leverage the service to log into online accounts at participating websites.  In this light, Lingham touted Civic as an alternative to OAuth, the open standard for authorization that today enables users to access customized experiences on platforms including Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter, one of its first major champions.  In interview, Lingham described the services that use the technology today as ""very centralized"" while positioning them as unfriendly to developers and consumers due to how they both track and enable access to this information.  Lingham told CoinDesk:  ""Civic offers the ability for third-party websites to request information from a consumer, or in the case of an app, transfer your personal information and approve the information transfer to that site. But it's up to you whether you want to give it to them and Civic doesn't track what happens.""  At today's event, Lingham gave a demonstration of how users can sign up for Civic, and how it stores the credentials to services locally on user devices, ""decentralizing data architecture"" and offering ""anonymous web logins"".  Lingham said Civic is now in the process of onboarding partners, and that it is particularly interested in working with financial institutions that want to offer a new way to meet anti-money laundering (AML) requirements.  So far, Lingham said Civic is working with ridesharing startup RideConnect, and he explained how the service reduces the need for its app to track and store customer data.  ""We are never in the middle of this transaction, but the beauty is [they're] getting verified information,"" CTO Jonathan Smith said.  Blockchain details  Onstage, Lingham was open about the company's use of blockchain technology and why the technology reduces friction in the identity verification process, though he didn't offer any specifics on how this aspect of the service works.  For example, Lingham indicated that blockchain will likely play a role in facilitating and guarding the information exchange that takes place between users and websites that seek to use Civic as a way to offer logins.  ""We're using cryptography and blockchain to sign messages back and forth and show that you're owner of the credentials,"" Lingham said, adding:  ""If you can verify if you have the private keys that are verified by Civic, you can prove you're the authorized user.""  Blockchain technology, he suggested, would also enable Civic to offer the service without owning or managing the data.  Identity player  Still, Civic isn't the only player working on solving problems related to identity, a sector that has received new attention in the wake of improving sentiment about blockchain.  As opposed to larger firms that have expressed interest in the use case, Lingham said that innovation in this area was more likely to come from a startup, one that has a ""core culture and DNA"" that supports consumer privacy.  ""How many companies want to build a decentralized ID system where they have no data on the consumer? We don't want to do data mining, we do things that protect the user,"" he said.  Lingham argued that this gives Civic an advantage over companies that have traditionally monetized by leveraging access to consumer data.  He concluded:  ""It's all about empowering the user.""

42427107,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPRh,1477419928,Overstock's Blockchain Stock Will Begin Trading in December,"Online retail giant Overstock will begin trading blockchain-based shares of its stock in December.  CEO Patrick Byrne revealed the news today at Money2020, outlining the actions investors will need to take in the run-up of the release of the shares, as well as the key dates involved in the process.  As explained by Byrne, the initial sale will done as a rights offering, meaning interested investors will need to hold Overstock stock by 7th November in order to be eligible to receive shares by 10th November. On 15th November, a subscription period will open, at which time investors can decide whether they want to partake in the offering.  Byrne told the audience.  ""Given our T+3 settlement, you will be a record holder by 10th November... If all goes well, it could be trading by 15th December.""  The reveal comes just days after Overstock's cryptocurrency group general manager Judd Bagley hinted at an upcoming announcement in an earlier panel session on capital markets. (Byrne had suggested the news was forthcoming as early as August when he returned to a leadership role at the company following a leave of absence).  Onstage, Byrne indicated his belief remains that the blockchain could prove to be a ""more disruptive force"" than the Internet.  ""My allegiance is not to bitcoin, but the blockchain. Three years ago, I realized the blockchain was going to disrupt a lot of things in our civilization,"" he told attendees.  Byrne used the remainder of the talk to discuss the various technology and business partnerships that enabled Overstock to build up to the forthcoming stock offering.  Additional details about the offering can be found in the full press release.

42427103,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPHh,1477413342,Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Tests Blockchain,"One of Japan’s largest banks is working with IBM on a series of blockchain trials.  Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited announced today that it is exploring applications related to finance, real estate and asset custody.  Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank is a member of the R3 blockchain consortium, having joined the group last December. Earlier this year, the bank announced that it was partnering with several institutions in Japan, including Osaka-based Kinki University, to research applications of the technology. Today’s announcement suggests that the research has spurred the bank to begin developing prototypes alongside IBM Japan and domestic IT firm NEC Corporation.  The bank said in a statement:  “The experiments aim to assess the possibilities and validate the effectiveness of utilizing revolutionary IT technologies to achieve dramatic improvement or streamlining of existing services and operations.”  The bank further said that it would work with a joint venture between SBI Holdings and Ripple on testing cross-border remittances using the technology. Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank said that, in the long term, it hopes to “create new remittance/settlement services utilizing blockchain technology”.

42427113,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPdh,1477404462,"Russian, Chinese Central Securities Depositories Partner on Blockchain","The central securities depositories (CSDs) in Russia and China have signed a memorandum of understanding that sets the stage for the two institutions to begin partnering on post-trade blockchain applications.  Announced today  , the deal will see Russia’s National Settlement Depository (NSD) and China’s Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited (CSDC) ""exchange experience and information” on a range of issues, according to an announcement from NSD. The two institutions will also collaborate on experimenting with fintech, which will include trials involving blockchain.  According to NSD executive board chairman Eddie Astanin, the cooperation on fintech and blockchain is one of the primary aspects of the deal.  Astanin said in a statement:  ”Cooperation in the FinTech sphere will become an important element in our cooperation with CSDC. In particular, we agreed to coordinate our efforts aimed at researching the opportunities for using the blockchain technology in the post-trade sector.”  The NSD announced earlier this year that it was experimenting with blockchain-based voting, developing a prototype to enable votes directly on the ledger. The firm later told CoinDesk that the technology could enable financial firms to discover new markets and services.  Representatives from the CSDC recently spoke out about the tech, calling for more involvement from regulators.

42427102,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPFh,1477401781,Walmart Wants to Apply Blockchain to Other Products Beyond Pork,"Trying to make pork products in China safer was just the first step of Walmart’s global plans for blockchain.  The pilot unveiled last week uses technology from the Hyperledger project to track pork shipping information, including farm origination details, batch numbers and storage temperatures on a secure blockchain.  Over the months ahead, the retail giant wants to expand on that work. Walmart vice president of global food safety Frank Yiannas told CoinDesk that, in anticipation of a successful pilot launch, the company is already looking to the future for other applications.  Yiannas told CoinDesk:  ""We will immediately work to identify additional food products where we might utilize blockchain to enhance our ability to track and trace them.""  If successful, the project could improve accountability on a major supply chain (pork is China's most popular meat product). Walmart is undertaking the project in partnership with IBM and Tsinghua University in Beijing.  Following the completion of the trial, Yiannas said Walmart will work with IBM on additional applications, including other supply chains that could be tracked via blockchain.  Blockchain side-effects  But it’s not just healthier food that Yiannas believes will be among the final results of building blockchain into a number of industries in China and around the world.  Yiannas says the safer conditions resulting from a more transparent, accurate record of supply chain transactions on a blockchain could have an overall impact on the Walmart brand.  He remarked:  ""Examples of the benefits could include safer food, enhanced consumer trust, enhanced flow to provide fresher products to customers, fresher and faster deliveries could reduce food waste in the home, and more.""  The $213b global retailer has long been working to ensure that products which reach its stores meet certain standards, but continues to face related lawsuits.  Walmart was sued earlier this year because cheese products it sold allegedly contained wood pulp, and last year the retailer settled charges over a corn starch it sold that claimed to be ""all natural"" but actually included genetically modified material.

42427116,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPhh,1477398211,Consumers’ Research Publishes Bretton Woods Blockchain Paper,"Consumers' Research has published a new white paper months after organizing a meeting of legislators, regulators and blockchain entrepreneurs at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire.  Held in July under Chatham House rules, the event drew attendees from the US Department of Commerce, the Federal Trade Commission and the National Institute of Standards and Technology as well as groups like the MIT Media Lab and Coin Center. Also taking part were US Representatives Mick Mulvaney and David Schweikert.  The goal of the event was to produce a framework focused on consumer protection, with an eye to bridge the concerns of regulators and lawmakers with the ambitions of entrepreneurs working in the digital currency and blockchain space.  The result: a white paper detailing “guiding principles on consumer protection best practices” that emerged from those discussions. Consumers’ Research also published a draft bill of consumers’ rights, which includes a call for free access at any time to funds held by third parties.  CR executive director Joe Colangelo explained to CoinDesk:  “You have a right to work with a website, to demand security, to demand privacy. We enumerated on those and if you’re a business, we didn’t want to go too into the weeds. We wanted to have guiding principles.”  From here, the organization plans to solicit input from industry stakeholders, regulatory bodies and mainstream financial institutions. The hope, according to Colangelo, is to “tear apart our definitions and suggestions” in order to build the strongest framework possible.  “We’re really focused on making this into a self-regulatory effort,” he said.

42427108,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPPh,1477365783,The Blockchain Created By Ethereum's Fork is Forking Now,"A blockchain that was born out of the rejection of a contentious technical change is on the cusp of making a decision some argue contradicts its core values.  That's the situation the developers behind ethereum classic face ahead of a hard fork expected to be enacted on its blockchain on 25th October (should network participants approve the upgrade). Originally formed in reaction to a decision by the ethereum community to edit its ""immutable"" ledger, the fork caused an ideological schism among its enthusiasts.  Alarmed by the action (or seeing a chance to profit by continuing the original network), miners and speculators began running its blockchain, which developers named ""ethereum classic"". Other investors then bought into the vision, and today, there are currently 85m classic ethers (ETC) worth $87m.  What perhaps wasn't foreseen, though, was that ethereum classic would face a situation where it would soon need to enact an unplanned hard fork.  But following a series of attacks that have targeted ethereum over the past month, ethereum classic has realized it is also vulnerable given its use of nearly identical technology. Pressure has further mounted on developers to resolve the issue after ethereum's successful hard fork.  Given the nascent nature of its community, the uncertain path forward for ethereum classic has spurred discussion among its supporters and detractors. As a result, some in the ethereum classic feel the group must act.  Ethereum classic community manager Carlo Vicari argued for the fork in practical terms, telling CoinDesk:  ""Either you do the update and the chain survives, or you don’t and the chain ceases to function. So, it’s kind of an easy choice.""  Those in the project's leadership say any criticisms amount to ""trolling"", or the willful spreading of uncertainty about ethereum classic and its vision.  Criticisms emerge  Still, the wider industry perhaps hasn't been friendly to ethereum classic's predicament.  Cornell computer scientist Emin Gün Sirer, for example, argued that by ethereum classic's reasoning, its new hard fork would compromise its immutability, or the idea that a transaction history should be final and not subject to revisions.  Ethereum classic developers don't quite see it that way, however. Instead, they argue that their ""own founding rules"", leave room for hard forks that fix technical problems.  ""Because of the technical nature of this fork and important security vulnerabilities it addresses, there was no contention about it within the community,"" lead developer Arvicco told CoinDesk.  He asserted that those who are against it don't ""understand the difference"" between protocol changes meant to improve the protocol and those that ""confiscate"" and ""redistribute"" funds.  A small group has even said that they will stay on the old ethereum classic blockchain if the fork occurs, with possible names including ""Ethereum Classic Unlimited,"" ""Ethereum Classic Uncensored"" or ""Ethereum Classic Classic"".  It's questionable how seriously to take this group, as the subreddit claims that they will never, under any circumstances, update the ethereum software. Others are less committed to a blockchain that never changes, arguing that ethereum classic should have voted on the decision.  Reddit user gobriangao, who has supervised two ethereum classic public surveys, argued that it sets a precedent for ethereum classic decision-making.  ""If we don't measure consensus formally now, how are we better than [ethereum]? How do we know when something is contentious? Who judges what constitutes an easy protocol fork or something worse? A few devs?"" Gobriangao wrote.  Gobriangao argued that ethereum classic needs to establish a governance system that sets the new blockchain apart from ethereum.  What's next?  The comments suggest ethereum classic will continue to try to differentiate itself from the second most popular blockchain from which it spawned, but the event itself highlights how disagreement about technical terms continues to divide blockchain communities.  Further, the hard fork strikes at the root of the recent discussions around immutability and the best way to make updates to public blockchains, a discussion also happening in bitcoin as well.  Some seem to think that the event at least it furthers discussion about different ""types"" of hard forks, and how much they change ""consensus rules"" (though others have speculated as to just how accurate this view is in describing how blockchains function).  Should ethereum classic execute a hard fork, it will also be recreating the events that led this to form. This means that miners and users will tomorrow have a choice whether they want to continue running the old blockchain, though Arvicco suggested community sentiment is against this idea due to the usability issues at play.  He concluded:  ""ETC volunteers keep informing people about the need to upgrade and help the users that encounter issues.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which is led by CEO and founder Barry Silbert. Silbert has previously disclosed he has invested in ethereum classic.
