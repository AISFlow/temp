The software is essentially a web-based mining manager for owners of large setups. You install it onto your machines and then launch a server that will collect and analyse all of the miners on your network. Once it has everything sorted, it will show their output, allow you to manage security and uptime, and generally makes it easy to see your network at a glance. It also manages overclocking and shows you, at a glance, how hot each machine is running.  The web-based tool is in public beta at Titan.io.  ""We're building an automation layer for farm management,"" said co-founder and CEO Ryan Condron. ""Each install is actively monitoring your network on-boarding devices, securing the devices, optimizing the devices, and then routing the hash power to the most popular point at any moment. ""  ""We get granular control over each device so we can really try to overclock based on chip temperatures. We do share auditing so every single share that rolls through the Titan software can see what was accepted by the pool,"" he said. ""Rejecting one of the biggest issues right now with mining farms that use a public pool. They have to trust the pool's dash for for the stats.""  Titan watches the work done by each miner, confirming that each machine receives credit for its work.  The team made installing Titan a one-click process. Once the miners are connected to the network you can watch them and even change root passwords as necessary. Condron said the solution even works globally, allowing you to connect miners remotely. The product works with a number of mining rigs including the AntMiner S9 and S11.  ""The concept for this was to make mining as easy as possible and as stable as possible,"" he said. ""Our long term vision is called the Titan Marketplace, where you could take a portion of your hash power and if you you want, you can put up on the market for others to use.""  The tool will launch this summer and the Marketplace launches in the fall, said Condron.

42430520,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvLPh,1558112422,SEC Uncertainty Looms Over Token Summit – Again,"It looks like Kik won't sue the SEC after all, founder Ted Livingston told CoinDesk.  In a widely circulated story, the Waterloo, Ontario, company had promised legal action against an expected regulatory action, but the odds that Kik will pursue that seem to be diminishing, even if the company's legal expenses are not. Nevertheless, Livingston would prefer the SEC take any action rather than continuing to delay.  ""What we’re saying to them is, ‘Stop dragging this out, if you want to go to court, if you think there is an infraction, then let’s go to court,’"" Livingston told CoinDesk at Token Summit 2019 in New York City on Thursday.  Livingston's remarks fell in line with a major theme of the summit itself: regulatory uncertainty.  The topic had also been a major theme last year and at the summit's prior iteration in San Francisco. In fact, it has felt like the endless conversation in crypto ever since ERC-20 tokens created a new fundraising strategy: selling access to new networks, rather than ownership stakes.  Jae Kwon, of Cosmos, gave a generally positive view of regulators' efforts, though he still noted gaps. He said it made a lot of sense for regulators to tamp down an ICO market that ""wasn't sustainable.""  Still, Kwon noted, ""There's a lot of innovation that's always ahead of the regulators.""  An investor in the space, Ash Egan of Accomplice VC, said this continuing conversation about what's legal is ""taking mindshare away.""  He told CoinDesk:  ""You have to actually think about: Do you want to engage, like Blockstack is, or do you want to ignore it?""  Courses of action  Playing by the rules is not cheap.  Muneeb Ali of Blockstack took the stage to discuss his company's Regulation A+ filing with the SEC. The Reg A+ is colloquially known as the mini-IPO and requires much of the same legal legwork.  Token Summit co-host William Mougayar said on stage that he had heard Blockstack had spent as much as $2 million to finalize its filing. While declining to confirm that figure, Ali said he expected that if Blockstack got a qualification for its offering to U.S. investors, then future companies would be able to take the same approach at a lower cost.  ""We are considering it a donation to our industry,"" Ali quipped.  Faith in Congress?  There are other approaches out there to dealing with regulatory uncertainty.  Many members of the larger crypto community appear to support redefining the terms, offering their support for Congressmen Warren Davidson and Darren Soto and their Token Taxonomy Act, which would exempt certain cryptocurrencies from securities laws.  Soto, a Florida Democrat, spoke briefly via video, urging attendees to press their own representatives to support his legislation:  ""As I look to the future of our economy, more and more transactions will be done through cryptocurrency.""  For his part, Ali acknowledged the legislative process currently underway but said his company did not feel it could wait. He also said he couldn't really conceive of following Kik's approach and challenging the SEC to a courtroom showdown.  Timothy Massad of the Brookings Institution didn't seem to believe the bill had much hope anyway.  He said that Soto is the exception among the House Democrats on the legislation because, he believes, most are uncomfortable with how much the bill undermines securities law.  An attorney who formerly helmed the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) under President Barack Obama, Massad's take comes from a Washington insider's perspective.  He also disagrees with the approach.  ""I wouldn't agree that this industry is different, that it needs a special exemption from securities law,"" he said. He conceded, however, that more clarity is needed and the present course, via enforcement actions, hasn't been the most efficient.  And that's left a bevy of other problems. One attendee pointed to protocols that suddenly forked themselves. Massad pointed to frontrunning and exchanges with trading desks that use their own customers' info to make trades.  Massad noted:  ""You've got all sorts of problems in the cash market for things that aren't securities.""  Definitional delay  But, on that point, another lawyer on the panel noted there are a lot more issues beyond how the law views crypto.  Robert Rosenblum, an attorney at Wilson SAonsini Goodrich & Rosati, said his firm has typically seen most cryptos as securities. He said that his coworkers have always felt the gap then was, ""So, now what?""  In other words, regulators need to explain, if tokens are securities, how the public should buy them and where trading markets can be established.  Kwon of Cosmos made a similar point. He noted that no one has any idea how to run a decentralized exchange in a way that's OK with U.S. regulators right now. But Rosenblum seemed to feel this would and could be worked out.  ""Only after we have a reasonably well-functioning market, will we have more experience, and a much better framework,"" Rosenblum said.  How long will that take, though? And that became the underlying question. Slowness tortures a very fast-moving industry.  Andreas Glarner, an attorney with European compliance firm MME, said that the view from Europe is that this entire industry is confused:  ""After roughly five years' time, the answer is: It's not clear. Otherwise, we wouldn't be sitting here. That's the outside view.""  Attorney Nancy Wojtas, a partner at Cooley LLP, said she agreed that the doubts are spurring companies to leave or at least domicile elsewhere, and that's a concern.  Kwon concurred:  ""If the U.S. is not careful, it's going to lose its ability to participate.""  Additional reporting by Nik De.

In an announcement Friday, Bitfinex said that the token – whose full name is apparently UNUS SED LEO, also the name of the token's formal issuer – will be listed on its platform and tradeable against bitcoin, the U.S. dollar, the tether stablecoin, ether and EOS. The company was first rumored to be considering a token sale last month, to make up for an $850 million shortfall in funds.  The exchange's chief technology officer, Paolo Ardoino, previously said that Bitfinex had closed the $1 billion sale last week, with investments apparently ranging from $1 million to $100 million.  It was not immediately clear who specifically had bought into this fundraising round, but on Friday, Bitfinex said that it had sold 100 percent of its tokens, in return for $1 billion in USDT.  ""The overwhelming response and expedient execution of the token sale represents a new milestone for Bitfinex and the greater Blockchain community,"" the post said, adding:  ""In addition to our excitement around bringing such an unprecedented and powerful token to the heart of our community, the Bitfinex team remains dedicated to continuing to grow and develop core infrastructure for our industry as a whole.""  The exchange has said in its white paper that it will buy back some percent of its circulating exchange tokens every month, based on its monthly revenue or potentially the unlocking of its funds by a payment processor, Crypto Capital.  The New York Attorney General's office first revealed that Bitfinex lost access to the funds held by Crypto Capital in April, though the exchange reportedly provided conflicting stories about why.  In recent court filings, Bitfinex said its funds were seized by authorities in the U.S., Poland and Portugal, but that it was working to regain access.

42430509,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvL3h,1558106116,OneCoin Claims It's Not a Ponzi or Pyramid Scheme,"The OneCoin cryptocurrency investment project has responded to the suggestion it is a Ponzi or pyramid scheme, arguing it does not fit the narrow definition of either.  In a report by Samoa Observer on May 14, the Central Bank of Samoa is quoted as saying last month that OneCoin is a ""hybrid ponzi-pyramid scheme"" which ""laundered money through New Zealand to Samoa"" and was targeting local residents through churches.  After the Observer reported the warning, it said it received a statement from OneCoin presenting its claims as to why it is neither Ponzi nor pyramid scheme.  It firstly offered up a definition of Ponzi schemes as arrangements where ""revenue for old investors is generated through the investment of new investors."" It also said that, regarding legislation on pyramid schemes, ""its origin and its express purpose is consumer protection.""  OneCoin makes the defense, therefore, that it, in fact, does not contractually require its agents, or Independent Marketing Associates (IMAs), to recruit other IMAs in order to earn their bonuses.  OneCoin states:  ""IMAs’ success depends entirely on their personal commitment, abilities and effort. IMAs can obtain an educational package and can only receive a bonus for their marketing activity, meaning they are not obliged to incur any additional expenses or recruit a new IMA.""  Agents are not rewarded for the recruitment of new agents but for the ""value of sales,"" it adds.  OneCoin goes on to make the argument that because when IMAs join the scheme they sign a contract classifying them as ""an independent, self-employed business owner,"" they cannot be defined as consumers who are protected under general legislation.  The statement reads:  ""The users which are part of the OneLife Network are NOT consumers. They are IMAs, meaning they are self-employed business owners.""  In effect, OneCoin says it's not a pyramid scheme because any financial harm to agents can't be classed under a dictionary definition of pyramid scheme, and it's not a Ponzi scheme because, although heavily incentivized to do so, it's not compulsory for IMAs to recruit new agents.  The statement further claims that as a ""centralized, closed source cryptocurrency"" with ""strict"" anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules, OneCoin ""is much more compliant than decentralized [cryptocurrencies].""  Indictments and arrests  It should be noted that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) recently indicted the leaders of the scheme, Ruja Ignatova and Konstantin Ignatov, on charges of wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering. Konstantin was arrested at the time, while Ruja remains at large.  U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said at the time that “these defendants created a multibillion-dollar ‘cryptocurrency’ company based completely on lies and deceit.”  The scheme has also been the subject of fraud warnings from authorities in numerous nations, while people associated with OneCoin have been arrested and charged in China and India. Its operations were also shut down in Italy.  A lawsuit, filed in New York last week by law firm Silver Miller on behalf of investor Christine Grablis, alleges that OneCoin fraudulently promoted cryptocurrency investments and violated federal securities laws. Grablis claims she lost $130,000 through the scheme.

42430517,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvLJh,1558098028,"Unpatched Ethereum Clients Pose 51% Attack Risk, Says Report","Ethereum clients that still haven't patched known vulnerabilities pose a security risk to the entire network, according to new research.  A report from Security Research Labs that used ethernodes.org data, indicates that a large number of nodes using the most popular clients Parity and Geth have been left exposed for ""extended periods of time"" after patches for security flaws have been released.  SRLabs says it reported a vulnerability in the Parity client in February that can open nodes up to being crashed remotely.  The report states:  ""According to our collected data, only two thirds of nodes have been patched so far. Shortly after we reported this vulnerability, Parity released a security alert, urging participants to update their nodes.""  Another patch, released on March 2, was also not picked up by 30% of Parity nodes, it says, while 7 percent of Parity nodes still have a version vulnerable to a critical consensus vulnerability patched last July.  While the Parity client does have an automated update process, it ""suffers from high complexity"" and not all updates are included, the report says.  The patch scenario for Geth is even worse, the research indicates.  ""According to their announced headers, around 44% of the Geth nodes visible at ethernodes.org were below version v.1.8.20, a security-critical update, released two-month before our measurement.,"" say the SR Labs team, noting that Geth does not have an auto-update feature, apparently by design.  SR Labs goes on to say that by leaving large numbers of clients potentially open to attacks, the whole ethereum network, which relies on having nodes highly available, is vulnerable too.  It warns:  ""If a hacker can crash a large number of nodes, controlling 51% of the network becomes easier. Hence, software crashes are a serious security concern for blockchain nodes (unlike in other pieces of software where the hacker does not usually benefit from a crash).""  To address the issue, the team suggests that ""more reliable"" processes for auto-updating clients are required. Further decentralizing the ethereum network by moving hashing power away from concentrations of miners would also help, it adds, although that looks unlikely to happen and wide security awareness would be key to the move's success.

42430519,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvLLh,1558094419,Bahamas Securities Regulator Proposes Rules for Token Sales,"The Bahamas' securities regulator is pushing for a new framework for token projects, aiming to turn the island nation into the jurisdiction of choice for blockchain startups.  The Securities Commission of the Bahamas has filed a draft of the new bill regulating token offerings not deemed securities. The bill lays out a procedure for registering such offerings and informing authorities and investors on the details of a token sale.  The draft was submitted for public consultations March 27 and comments will be gathered until May 28, Christina Rolle, executive director of the commission, told CoinDesk.  According to Rolle, the regulator is receiving a lot of comments and the consultation period will likely be extended for another month. Once it’s over, the document will be passed to the government of the Bahamas, and then to parliament. If everything goes as planned, the legislation may be passed this autumn, Rolle said.  Several other island nations have recently introduced various legislation aiming to attract crypto projects.  In Malta, the government passed three laws last June allowing to issue cryptocurrencies and trade in the country. The country scored a big win in the jurisdiction competition when Binance announced it was opening an office there in March. In Bermuda, a new law allows the projects carrying out initial coin offerings (ICOs) to apply to the minister of finance for fast approval. And Gibraltar, new legislation allowing the issuing and trading tokens is underway.  Inbound requests  “In late 2017, we started receiving a lot of interest in the jurisdiction for the registration of tokens. When we started to benchmark what was happening around the world we saw that we needed to create a legal framework,” Rolle said.  She added that other regulatory bodies in the Bahamas, including the Ministry of Finance, also have been getting inquiries from token projects looking for a jurisdiction to register.  Then the commission decided to come up with guidance that will give the token projects not deemed securities legal certainty. According to Rolle, the criteria for distinguishing security and utility tokens are still to be drafted and are expected to be ready before the end of May.  Even some tokens representing equity shares might be exempted from the country’s securities law, but the rules for that are still in the works, Rolle said.  In the meantime, a handful of companies that asked the commission for clarity have already received no-action letters, according to Rolle. These are letters written by staff members of a government agency stating that it will not take enforcement action against an entity for pursuing a proposed course of action.  One of these companies was PO8, a project aiming to tokenize archeological artifacts. While the artifacts themselves are stored in museums in the Bahamas and around the world, PO8 will be issuing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing their value, CEO Matt Arnett told CoinDesk.  The letter, obtained by CoinDesk, says that “the Commission will not pursue any enforcement action against PO8"" if it issues the NFTs, as the plan is not subject to existing securities law. However, once the new legislation is passed, PO8 will have to comply with it, the letter says.  What’s in the bill  According to the bill, shared with CoinDesk, the new regulation will apply to token issuers, wallet providers, exchanges and anyone who is facilitating an initial token offering on the Bahamas.  The bill obliges token projects to publish a memorandum with a description of the project, and if any significant changes are made to the offering, like the class of tokens or the scale of fundraising, the memorandum should be updated in a timely manner.  Any information that can “reasonably negatively affect the interests” of token buyers should also be disclosed by the issuer immediately, and the failure to do so might cost the company a fine of 10,000 Bahamian dollars ($10,000), the document says. Companies should also secure adequate insurance coverage for their projects.  In the application for the registration, a company would have to give a detailed technical and financial description of the token issuance, covering the project’s technology; governance; risks related to anti-money-laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations; and even the system’s scalability — this will help the regulators evaluate the projects' viability, Rolle said. The document doesn’t elaborate on how scalability will be measured.  To register, token projects will need to hire an attorney who will be the “sponsor” of the registration and communicate with the regulator. Registrants will be subject to the Bahamas’ Data Protection Act, Financial Transactions Reporting Act, Financial Transactions Reporting Regulations and Financial Intelligence Regulations, the draft says.  Failure to comply with the law will lead to a fine of $500,000 or imprisonment up to five years, and if issuers file misleading information in their registration documents, they risk up to ten years in prison.

42430522,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvLVh,1558090813,Bitcoin Suffers Biggest Intraday Price Drop for Over a Year,"View  Bitcoin tanked by $1,702 early on Friday, the biggest intraday drop since January 2018.  On the way back up, the hourly chart shows scope for re-test of former support-turned-resistance at $7,619.  A bounce to $7,619, if any, could be short-lived with prices falling back to $6,178 (daily low) over the weekend, as both the 4-hour and daily charts are biased bearish.  A bounce from the historically strong support of the 30-day moving average (MA) at at $5,986 would imply an end to the price pullback.  Amid extremely overbought conditions, bitcoin has fallen by $1,702 – its biggest intraday price drop since January 2018.  The cryptocurrency market leader nosedived from the day’s opening price (UTC) of $7,880 to a seven day low of $6,178 on Bitstamp in the Asian trading hours.  The $1,702 drop is the highest since January 17, 2018, according to Bitstamp data. On that day, BTC had tumbled by $2,171 from the opening price of $11,393 only to recovery all the way back to $11,191 by UTC close.  Bitcoin has recovered more than 50 percent since the low hit earlier today. However, just before press time, its price is still down around 8.2 percent on the day at $7,223.  The sell-off seen today doesn't come as much of a surprise, as the widely followed relative strength index (RSI) has been reporting extremely overbought conditions with a near-90 reading earlier this week.  Buyer exhaustion was also evident from BTC’s repeated failure to hold onto 10-month highs above $8,300, as seen in the last 72 hours.  What’s more, many in the investor community had associated BTC’s recent rise with Blockchain Week NYC and Consensus 2019. The cryptocurrency, therefore, was perhaps vulnerable to “sell the fact” pullback.  A massive unwinding of long BTC/USD positions (profit taking) was seen in the 120 minutes to 04:00 UTC, according to data tweeted by bot powered twitter handle @WhaleCalls. Further, some are saying online that a major sell order from one party may have triggered the downward move.  Looking forward, a minor bounce could be seen in the next 24 hours before a possible fall back to levels below $7,000.  Hourly and 4-hour charts  On the hourly chart (above left), the relative strength index (RSI) has bounced up from oversold levels seen earlier today, suggesting scope for a recovery toward the former support-turned-resistance of the double top neckline at $7,619.  That resistance, however, may cap upside and reverse any price bounce, as a bearish crossover of the 50- and 100-hour moving averages (MA) is almost confirmed.  Further, the RSI on the 4-hour chart (above right) has breached key support at 49.00 in favor of the bears and is yet to hit oversold territory, meaning there is scope for another drop below $7,000.  Daily chart  Bitcoin created a bearish outside day (engulfing) candle on Thursday, a sign of bullish exhaustion, validating a divergence of the RSI. That resulted in a slide to today's low of $6,178.  The move amounts to short-term bearish reversal, as per technical theory. So, the pullback may not be over yet and we could revisit lows seen today over the weekend.  That said, investors should watch out for a bounce from the 30-day MA, as that would imply an end of the correction. The average had reversed pullbacks in March and April.

42430507,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvKzh,1558087208,Amazon Wins Patent for Proof-of-Work Cryptographic System,"Tech giant Amazon has been granted a patent for various techniques to build a proof-of-work (PoW) cryptographic system similar to those used by blockchains such as bitcoin.  First filed in December 2016 and awarded Tuesday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the patent outlines how Merkle trees can be generated as a solution to a proof-of-work challenge, among other benefits.  A Merkle tree structure allows for verification of data sent between computers, and on peer-to-peer networks such as blockchains is used to ensure blocks are not falsified. The concept dates back to 1979.  PoW, on the other hand, is an algorithm that is used to protect networks by asking a service participant to do ""work"" – often involving using computer processing power to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The bitcoin blockchain network, for instance, uses a PoW algorithm with the work done by miners.  In this case, Amazon says, the Merkle tree creation is the work demanded by the algorithm.  The patent explains:  “A proof-of-work system where a first party (e.g., a client computer system) may request access to a computing resource. A second party (e.g., a service provider) may determine a challenge that may be provided to the first party. A valid solution to the challenge may be generated and provided for the request to be fulfilled.”  “The challenge may include a message and a seed, such that the seed may be used at least in part to cryptographically derive information that may be used to generate a solution to the challenge. A hash tree [or Merkle tree] may be generated as of generating the solution,” it adds.  PoW could also help prevent denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that frequently hit computer networks, Amazon says, explaining:  “Requiring a valid proof-of-work may mitigate a DOS or DDOS attack by causing the participants of the DOS or DDOS attack to generate a valid proof-of-work solution, which may require the use of computational resources on the attacking systems and dramatically reduce the rate at which entities participating in the attack may send requests.”  Elsewhere, the patent also mentions “cryptographic key,” “digital signature” and “public signing key,” among other concepts related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies. The patent does not directly discuss blockchains or cryptocurrencies, however.  While a much talked about Amazon cryptocurrency has so far remained elusive, the e-commerce giant has been moving further into the blockchain space. Earlier this month, its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), launched its Managed Blockchain service for wider use among enterprise clients. The service currently supports open-source framework Hyperledger Fabric, while the support for the ethereum network is still in the works and is expected to be made available later this year.

A Reuters report on Friday, citing “people familiar with the plans,” said possibly a dozen unspecified banks are involved in the project. The participating banks will reportedly be setting up a new entity called Fnality for the project, which could launch next year.  Back in 2015, Swiss banking giant UBS was said to be working on a cryptocurrency that would be “linked to real-world currencies and connected to central bank accounts” along with blockchain startup Clearmatics.  Indeed, Clearmatics seems to have filed a trademark application for the word “Fnality,” according to information from trademark service Justia Trademarks.  Later, in August 2016, four other banks – BNY Mellon, ICAP, Deutsche Bank and Santander – joined UBS and Clearmatics on the “utility settlement coin” (USC) project. Clearmatics founder Robert Sams told CoinDesk at the time that USC is as a form of digital cash that is “fully backed by cash assets at the central bank.”  According to the Reuters report, Bank of New York Mellon Corp, State Street Corp, Credit Suisse Group, Barclays, HSBC Holdings and Deutsche Bank have also been working on the USC project.  A Barclays spokeswoman told Reuters:  “We are a member of the USC Project and can confirm that the Research & Development phase is coming to an end.”  The news comes soon after investment banking giant JPMorgan revealed its own cryptocurrency, dubbed JPM Coin, to settle some of its transactions between clients of its wholesale payments business in real time.

42430521,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvLNh,1558080049,Digital Renminbi: A Fiat Coin to Make M0 Great Again,"Dovey Wan is a partner at Primitive Ventures, a crypto asset investment fund.      Contrary to what many think, China does not oppose blockchain technology.  Rather, it takes issue with bitcoin and other privately issued cryptocurrencies, which it fears may facilitate financial fraud and capital flight. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has, in fact, had an initiative for issuing a blockchain-based digital renminbi (RMB) since 2014. The project has already generated 71 patents and has initiated a trial operation for an interbank digital check and billing platform.  If successful, this digital RMB project could expand the central bank’s influence over both the domestic and international economy. It has broad implications for the geopolitics of money and for the future of private cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. To understand the PBOC’s motives, we must first distinguish between the digitalization of fiat currency and digital fiat currency. They are not the same thing. Each has a very different impact on the money supply and on the power balance between central banks and commercial banks.  The digitization of currency, which stems from the advent of electronic payment/clearance and mature interbank IT systems, allows commercial banks to more efficiently and independently generate the credit flows that expand broad  money supply, or M2. By contrast, digital fiat currency, enabled by blockchain technology, affects the base currency measure known as M0.  Traditionally, central banks directly control base money creation/destruction but have only indirect power over the broader, credit flow-driven monetary supply. Now, with digital fiat currency, they have the potential to bypass commercial banks and regain control of currency creation/supply end to end, thereby structurally centralizing their power in policymaking.  The PBOC’s interest in this solution comes as highly advanced digital payment systems like Alipay and WeChat have created a cashless and cardless economy. This is a form of currency digitalization, built upon a network of commercial bank accounts, operating at the M2 level of money supply.  By contrast, a digital RMB would be integrated into M0, thus restoring control and influence to the PBOC. As the Vice President of PBOC Fan Yifei put it in a public interview: “With the help of technology innovation, we can gradually transit into issuance and circulation of digital RMB and impose effective supervision of in the private sector.""  High M2 supply and massive shadow banking  From 2007 to 2017, China's M2 supply grew from 40 trillion RMB to 170 trillion RMB ($25.5 trillion), with an average annual growth rate of 15%, far outpacing the 10 percent nominal GDP growth rate over the same period. This massive expansion is largely due to the excessive issuance of commercial bank loans, primarily for real estate development, local governments’ infrastructure projects, and state-owned enterprises.  It has led to a highly leveraged banking system and left a huge debt risk hanging over the Chinese economy.  What’s more, the measurement of M2 underestimates the real currency growth rate in China due to shadow banking. High-yield “wealth management products” and structural deposits offered by banks, as well as internet financing such as P2P lending, make up a separate financial industry that’s worth 70 trillion RMB.  Wealth management products alone have grown from a 0.5 trillion RMB industry in 2007 to a whopping 30 trillion in 2017. These are not counted as M2 and are often hard to track due to their being hidden from bank balance sheets, making it even harder for the PBOC to manage the Chinese economic cycle. Current attempts to address the problem largely consist of more stringent reporting and regulation, but this merely chases behind the problem rather than stamping it out.  To get ahead of it requires a new financial system altogether. That’s what’s intended with the Digital RMB, a project that’s conceived of as a means of reasserting monetary control in the interests of financial stability.  Design methodology  While the PBOC is still considering different possibilities for network design, it seems likely to be a permissioned network in which nodes are controlled by the PBOC and major Chinese banks. This suggests transactions will be visible to the banks and government, but not to the public.  According to Yao Qian, the head of PBOC Digital Currency Research Center, the designated PBOC digital currency system has a few key elements:  A PBOC-managed private cloud as the IT infrastructure  A database on the private cloud to allow the PBOC to exercise full control over monetary issuance and ledger management  A reserve database accessible by commercial banks, which can either reside on the PBOC private cloud or on banks’ own private cloud  A digital RMB wallet client, published and maintained by the PBOC that’s used by all entities and individual  A verification center where the PBOC can manage institutional and user identity information  A registration center which records the registration of currency ownership and keeps the ledger of digital currency generation, circulation, and inventory management  A big data analysis center used for anti-money laundering, payment behavior analysis, and analysis of regulatory signals.  Some might wonder why blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) is needed at all if nodes are not highly decentralized. The answer is that a blockchain model offers a better coordination paradigm compared to traditional currency supply management, which is heavily dependent on bookkeeping. Blockchain’s tamper-proof nature and private-key cryptography prevent false transactions and counterfeiting, while also making it much easier for the PBOC to manage the circulation flow.  Domestic impacts and beyond  The issuance of a digital RMB will not only make cash and coinage obsolete (which is already happening in China), but also make commercial banks and M2 easier to control. It means the PBOC can more effectively control and regulate an  overextended debt market. Thanks to blockchain’s traceability and programmability, it will become much more difficult to hide banking products and services from balance sheets.  This also allows for easier execution and more accurate assessment of monetary policy, and makes the measurement of currency supply, circulation speed, currency multipliers, and distribution much more accurate. PBOC can write rules at the code level regarding where digital RMB can and cannot flow to. If it wants to cool down the housing market, for example, it can simply set a program preventing digital RMB from entering the real estate sector.  As for policing individuals, a person’s spending history and assets balance are immediately evident on the blockchain, making it much easier to accurately assess creditworthiness, detect money laundering, and prevent tax evasion and capital flight. This is, of course, is likely to strengthen privacy advocates’ already mounting criticisms of China’s social credit score model, It’s not clear that such criticism is having any influence over the government’s thinking on such matters, however.  A digital RMB could even strengthen China’s influence overseas. If the One Belt One Road initiative succeeds, a digital, borderless, stable currency could facilitate international trade among its 60-plus member countries. This, coupled with the fact that China is the biggest creditor to Venezuela and it holds over 14 percent of African countries’ sovereign debt, would position it to offer a digital RMB as the next reserve currency of emerging-market economies.  This would require those countries to confer to China some degree of influence over their monetary conditions. Would they prefer that to their current dependency on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s dollar?  It’s an open question. But it will be highly synergetic with China’s rigorous effort of de-dollarization: reducing US dollar asset in both its foreign exchange reserve, largely increasing its gold reserve and selling off US Treasury debt. Either way, these moves could increase tensions between US and China and might even force the U.S. to pursue a similar digital model for the dollar.  We still have a little time before such questions become pressing. Even so, change is coming. According to people working on this initiative, adoption will come with a great deal of observation and adjustment over the course of 10 years or more, with experiments in various use cases starting in “special economic zones” like the city of Shenzhen. Eventually, the plan is to use incentives such as increasing the transaction cost of cash to push people towards using digital currency.  Cash is expected to disappear almost entirely.  The next question is: what does this mean for private, decentralized cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin?  It may seem incongruous that blockchain technology, initially introduced under the ethos of censorship-resistance, is now being used by central banks to further centralize their financial power. But from the perspective of the Chinese government, it’s not hard to see why. Over the long term, a digital RMB has the potential to make global trade more efficient and money laundering more difficult.  Yet, given worldwide concern over surveillance by centralized institutions – both public and private – and the perennial risk that monetary policy mismanagement could foster a currency collapse akin to the Venezuelan bolivar, there’s no reason to believe such programs will kill private cryptocurrencies. On the contrary, it could boost demand for them. Anonymous, non-sovereign currencies like bitcoin or privacy coins become increasingly important in an environment where government money is closely surveilled and controlled.  What’s more, a programmable fiat digital currency could provide a seamless fiat-to-crypto on-ramp. Ironically, projects such as China’s, in which governments aim to concentrate control over money, could foster greater competition from private systems of money such as bitcoin.

On May. 17 at 2:00 UTC, bitcoin (BTC) dropped by 16.7 percent to find a bid below $7,000 at $6,600 before rising once more on the back of high volatility, moving above $7,000 to where it currently sits at $7,300, according to CoinMarketCap and CoinDesk data.  In the last 24 hours, bitcoin’s market capitalization also dropped more than $10 billion over a 24-hour period. However, BTC remains positive over a 7-day period, up $14 billion on the week amid high volatility and market disagreements on its true price.  The reasons for the sell-off could be attributed to large sell-orders liquidating numerous stop-loss positions and invoking general panic amongst traders.  Indeed a sell-order on the Bitstamp exchange for example, of 3,645 BTC or $26.8 million in US dollar terms, was executed at around 02:00 UTC on May 17 and could have been one of the major causes for a dip below $7,000.  It’s no small secret that when bitcoin moves in value, the rest of the crypto markets may also do so as seen by a large capitulation in daily prices which are currently down between 11 and 22 percent amongst the top 100 at CoinMarketCap.  Ether (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC) all suffered similar losses losing between 8 and 16 percent in value while stellar (XLM), XRP and cardano (ADA) were the hardest hit in the top 10 by market capitalization, dropping 16.3, 16.5, 16.7 percent respectively.
