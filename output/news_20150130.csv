The news comes amid a service update in which it introduced new “cards” that aim to deliver timely information to Android phone users while removing their need to search for it directly.  The launch included 40 cards, each based on a company or popular Internet service such as Airbnb, Pandora and Coinbase.  According to the company, Coinbase’s card will specifically notify Google Now users when there are fluctuations in the price of bitcoin, while Airbnb's will suggest travel information.  With the news, Google Now becomes the latest Google service that supports some bitcoin-related functionality, following its decision to add bitcoin prices to its search engine this summer.

42398190,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSlc1,1422657330,Bitcoin ATM Maker Robocoin Hints at Software Shift,"Robocoin CEO Jordan Kelley has addressed rumors the company may be pivoting, suggesting it may soon expand the means by which its allows consumers to buy and sell bitcoin.  The rumors, which first surfaced on 29th January, implied the company would be moving away from its bitcoin ATM hardware due to the technical difficulties managing its network, and that Robocoin's future was perhaps in jeopardy due to these issues.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Kelley didn’t deny the rumors so much as seek to rephrase the question, suggesting that Robocoin has always been broadly focused on helping consumers acquire bitcoin.  Kelley said:  “Our core business has been bringing bitcoin to the world. That means that we allow customers to easily buy and sell bitcoin via ATMs and kiosks. Our business hasn’t changed, it isn’t changing.”  Rather than framing the company as failing, Kelley suggested the company is on the verge of upcoming announcements, stating also his belief that it has largely addressed many of the problems its operators previously reported.  What was perhaps most notable about the conversation was his choice of words, referring to ATM operators as owners of “Robocoin-enabled devices” and emphasizing the strength of the company’s software solutions.  When asked if this meant Kelley would be shifting the company strategy toward selling software solutions to more traditional ATM manufacturers, here again Kelley answered cryptically, promising more details at a later date.  “I’m not saying the word just yet, but you might be on to something,” he said.  Kelly suggested more announcements will be forthcoming in Q1 of 2015.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/30/bitcoin-atm-maker-robocoin-hints-at-software-shift,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42398193,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSljt,1422652871,Ribbit Capital's Micky Malka Talks Bitcoin's Slow Road to Mainstream,"Two years ago, the entrepreneurs in bitcoin were inexperienced and those investing in the space were merely a collection of friends, according to Meyer “Micky” Malka.  Flash forward to today and the Bitcoin Foundation board member and founder of VC firm Ribbit Capital can find more than a few reasons to be optimistic about the future of bitcoin, even in the face of continued price declines, issues in the mining community and questions about the commercial viability of bitcoin technology.  Before it can propel itself forward to new highs, however, Malka believes bitcoin must first account for mistakes made during its impressive hype cycle that began at the end of 2013. He predicts we’ll see a “reshuffling” of the ecosystem, as sectors like mining are forced to recover from a bullish run of investments founded on lofty expectations.  Suggesting that this might be another transitional year for the bitcoin market as a whole, Malka told CoinDesk:  “There’s going to be an adjustment in the market, and now my expectation is this is a year when we'll see more clarity and guidance from regulators around the world.”  In this light, Malka sees announcements like Coinbase’s recent recordsetting $75m funding round as part of a slow but steady turnaround for the industry.  This period, he expects, won’t be marked by any impressive leaps forward, but rather a steady build-up of trust between consumers and businesses and a potentially transformative technology.  Building consumer trust  Through most of the conversation, Malka returns to his bedrock belief, that building consumer trust is essential for the bitcoin ecosystem.  “We always thought that you had to have consumer-centric brands that the general public will trust, the same way they trusted PayPal in 1999,” Malka explained. “If you look at our portfolio, they are all companies that are building consumer brands and that create trust.”  Despite his status as a bitcoin advocate and investor, Ribbit Capital, the company he runs with Nick Shalek and Nikolay Kostov, has made few moves in the bitcoin ecosystem to date, a factor Malka attributes to this philosophy.  Ribbit Capital investments include peer-to-peer lending startup BTCJam, Coinbase and bitcoin security leader Xapo.  Malka pointed to Coinbase and Xapo as two brands that have succeeded at building trust, even amidst a sometimes turbulent bitcoin ecosystem, noting the partnerships Coinbase has secured with tier-one merchants.  “This reinforces trust over time and like in any sector, when it starts to mature, some companies become the clear leaders in the category,” he added.  Malka went on to suggest that this process is already visibly underway, comparing the issues experienced this year by bitcoin exchange Bitstamp, with that of the implosion of the former market leader Mt Gox in 2013.  “Fast forward a year and companies go through troubles, but you see how Bitstamp managed its problems, how they were transparent, how they said what happened and how they committed to getting capital to make it up to all the clients,” Malka said. “That’s astonishing.”  Silk Road spectre wanes  Alluding to the ongoing, high-profile court case, Malka suggested that there is a broader understanding in the mainstream media that bitcoin and the online black market Silk Road, while intertwined in history, are not correlated.  Smart companies, Malka argued, have always built bitcoin business with the understanding that bitcoin needs to be regulated – as Coinbase and Xapo, two companies that act as custodians for customer funds, have always recognized.  “Each one of the entrepreneurs that we’ve backed, they understand that their business is one that, one way or the other, will have some regulation, because that’s what happens, and they have to be willing to work in that environment,” he said.  Malka cited Xapo CEO Wences Casares as an example given his long experience as an entrepreneur working within regulatory environments. Casares’ previous work includes projects like the Lemon digital wallet, which was sold to LifeLock for $42m in December 2013.  Further, he indicated that Coinbase founders Fred Ehrsam and Brian Armstrong always demonstrated a willingness to work with banks, a factor that set them apart from other younger entrepreneurs Ribbit Capital considered.  Still a venture space  Despite the growth and maturation he’s seen, Malka believes that the bitcoin ecosystem is still one best suited to venture capitalists, not more risk-averse investors.  Notably, he ended by referencing the existential risk the bitcoin ecosystem faces, suggesting that for all the work, bitcoin could still prove an impressive failure.  “The chances of things blowing up is still very high, it could be a price drop, it could be the government blows up … so we have to be aware of that, the risk is still that it can go away,” he cautioned.  Still, Malka seems convinced that these risks, while real, won’t come to pass. Instead, he believes that those involved in bitcoin’s development will look back on current developments with a wistful nostalgia that exposes how truly impressive its evolution has been.  “We’re going to look back and say, ‘Oh the government was trying to get bitcoin to auction, they consider it an asset’ … ‘Oh wow, Fortune 500 companies were starting to back companies,” Malka said, adding:  “Those are the things that are changing. Those are very powerful experiences that will take a while for people to realize.”  Images via About.me, YouTube",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/30/ribbit-capitals-micky-malka-talks-bitcoins-slow-road-to-mainstream,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/32716ff4e27ab3e9cd4934a71f586cb86551bf26-1059x684.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398191,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSlgw,1422645952,Bank Suspends Polish Bitcoin Exchange's Accounts,"Polish bitcoin exchange BitMarket.pl has had its bank accounts suspended by Bank BPH.  BPH  initially said the suspension was the result of a technical glitch, but later claimed it was due to outstanding debt and lack of credentials, according to BitMarket.pl. The exchange said it discovered its BPH accounts were suspended on 26th January.  BitMarket.pl founder Michal Pleban told CoinDesk that the real reason for the bank’s decision was prompted by a query filed by the local district attorney’s office. The filing revolved around one particular transaction on the exchange, which was allegedly performed with stolen funds.  “For that reason, the bank decided to close all our accounts and refuse our business,” he said.  The exchange never received a notification from the bank or the authorities, according to Pleban. He said he was unable to see the query that eventually prompted the bank to freeze the accounts.  In addition, Pleban said the bank’s compliance team made a mistake by closing the account before it disabled the IT connector. This resulted in transactions being channelled to the already disabled account. The bank said the transactions would eventually be returned to their senders.  CoinDesk has contacted BPH for additional comment on the matter, but no response had been received at press time.  New bank account  Pleban said the exchange has decided to create a new company to take ownership of BitMarket.pl and is seeking to open a new account with a different bank.  He added that the exchange is trying to normalise operations:  “This should take no more than two weeks. In the meantime, we have re-enabled electronic fiat transfers which will be warehoused at the payment processor until a new bank account is opened. We also re-enabled crypto deposits, and all withdrawals are performed normally from my own personal account. Normal (non-electronic) fiat transfers will be re-enabled once a new bank account is established.”  Pleban is also looking into the possibility of taking legal action against the bank, claiming his lawyer is preparing the necessary paperwork.  “I am currently on a quest to find a bitcoin-friendly bank in Poland,” he added.  BitMarket.pl opened in March 2014, promising to offer superior security following a number of attacks on local exchanges.

42395312,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaH36,1422637022,UK Exchange Launches with Backing From Regulated E-Money Firm,"The team behind a regulated e-money issuer has launched a bitcoin exchange called Digital Securities Exchange (DSX).  The issuer, ePayments Systems Ltd, has been an authorised electronic money institution with the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, since last July. ePayments Systems has in turn made DSX its agent.  The move is meant to position DSX to capture the market for sterling-bitcoin trading, said Mike Rymanov, who founded and leads both ventures.  Rymanov said:  ""The sterling market is absolutely untouched. We have the opportunity to corner this market completely and this is our intention.""  DSX, which launched in December, offers trading in bitcoin, litecoin, pounds sterling and euros. Customers can make deposits and withdrawals through SEPA or SWIFT transfers.  ePayments Systems has more than 200,000 customers and a transaction volume of $50m a month, according to Pari Andrade, the exchange's head of marketing.  Dual accounts required  Deposits to the exchange have to flow through ePayments Systems. Customers of the exchange therefore have to create accounts on both platforms.  The relationship between DSX and ePayments Systems is complicated by a third company, Electronic Payments Association Ltd. Customers funds are currently routed through the EPA, also a Rymanov company, that works in partnership with an e-money issuer in Gibraltar.  ""The EPA is our distribution concept. In order to get a wallet, you have to become a member of this association,"" he said.  The EPA mainly serves online publishers and currency traders, who were an ideal market for a ""soft launch"" of the bitcoin exchange, Rymanov said. Within the next month, the EPA will be removed from the chain of transactions, allowing customers to deal directly with DSX and ePayments Systems, he added.  The same executive team runs both DSX and ePayments. Rymanov said he ran business development for Mergermarket, a financial information service that was part of the Financial Times Group when Rymanov worked there, in Central and Eastern Europe before starting ePayments.  The use of an FCA-regulated payment processor to accept deposits from customers for a bitcoin exchange is not a new manoeuvre. The longstanding but shadowy exchange BTC-e – its operators remain anonymous – accepts deposits from an FCA-regulated company called Mayzus Financial Services, for example.  However, DSX's status as a registered agent of the regulated ePayments Systems adds a new layer of scrutiny to the exchange, although it does not confer FCA-regulated status on the exchange.  Users must create accounts and offer their identity information to ePayments Systems as part of anti-money laundering rules the issuer must follow.  ""Everybody who trades on DSX is subject to the same compliance procedures as the regulated entity,"" Rymanov said.  The fact that funds must flow through ePayments Systems before going to DSX will likely give potential customers of the exchange some reassurance, at least of their fiat funds, said Adam Vaziri, a director of consultancy Diacle, which advises on compliance and regulatory matters.  ""From a customer's point of view, they see the money they're depositing is with an authorised institution and flowing to a related party,"" he said.  Debit card offering  Another novelty in the DSX/ePayments approach is the fact that customers can transfer funds from the exchange into a pre-paid MasterCard offered by the payment processor.  The card works like a debit card and can also be used to withdraw cash from ATMs. The spending limit on the card is $20,000 per day, while ATM withdrawals are capped at $3,000 daily, Andrade said.  She explained that funds on ePayments are insured by Lockton, an insurance brokerage headquartered in Kansas City. DSX is working to obtain insurance for funds on its platform and is in contact with underwriters in London, Andrade added.  The importance of regulation  Exchanges and bitcoin businesses in the UK have been unable to secure stable relationships with local banks.  Swedish exchange Safello, in a notice to customers days before it was force to abandon UK Faster Payments by its bank, said it had done ""everything in its power"" to prevent the closure of its account, but to no avail. It did not reveal who its bank was.  Last month the bitcoin hedge fund manager Global Advisors was forced to look elsewhere after its longtime bank HSBC gave notice.  In September, the London-based exchange Coinfloor ceased offering Faster Payments when its service provider Capital Treasury Services cut ties with its bitcoin clients after pressure from the banks it works with.  Rymanov is sanguine about his firm's prospects with UK banks:  ""Our banking relationships will hold up. This is the reason we take the regulated approach, the banks do not bank a company that handles bitcoins, it handles an entity that is regulated.""

42398186,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSla3,1422624667,DigitalBTC Dissolves Bitcoin Mining Agreement with CloudHashing,"Australian bitcoin company digitalBTC has dissolved a supply agreement with cloud mining service CloudHashing.  Under the agreement, which was finalised in March, CloudHashing was to run digitalBTC hardware in data centres in Iceland and Texas to mine bitcoins.  Today, however, digitalBTC announced that it was pulling out of the deal, filing an announcement with the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) that stated the companies had agreed to dissolve the supply deal.  Under the settlement, CloudHashing's shares in digitalBTC are to be cancelled.  The announcement states:  “The settlement agreement stipulates that 8,276,465 ordinary shares in the company (4.9% of the issued capital) are to be cancelled for nil consideration, delivering a net benefit to all remaining shareholders by reducing the total number of ordinary shares on issue. In addition, 3,742,520 Performance Rights issued to CloudHashing under the previous supply agreement are to be cancelled.""  DigitalBTC's management board unanimously recommended that all shareholder vote in favour of the proposal, as it would deliver an increase in value per share for remaining shareholders.  The buyback will not require any payments on to CloudHashing. DigitalBTC also stressed that it had managed mining operations without any input from CloudHashing from mid-2014.  ""Basically digitalBTC have not used CloudHashing for over six months, it's just taken time to settle the agreement,"" a person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk.  DigitalBTC said the arrangement was reached after “key outcomes from the strategic agreement in March 2014 did not eventuate”. The company also pointed out that planned launch of its Mintsy product is expected to enable it to “sell significant processing capacity.”  CoinDesk has reached out to both companies for comment.  CloudHashing buys back contracts  In other news, CloudHashing has started buying back cloud mining contracts, according to reports from customers.  CoinDesk has obtained one email from the company, while others were posted on discussion boards and Reddit by other users. In the offer, the company also announced an increase in the maintenance fee.  CloudHashing  informed its customers about the buyback plan in an email sent on 29th January:  ""We have some important information for you about your CloudHashing service. Please visit [our website] and login to view your account message. For a limited period only CloudHashing is offering to purchase your bitcoin mining contract. This offer expires in 10 days. Please log into your account to view this offer.""  Once contacted customers logged in, they were presented with a choice of keeping their contracts with an increased management fees, or selling them back to the company.  One example read:    “Due to the changed financial viability of our cloud mining service, we have decided to increase the management fees associated with the service to USD $0.15 (15 cents) per gigahash per month.      This amount ($4.26 per month) will be deducted directly from your mining earnings. If your mining earnings are not sufficient to cover the management fees, you will be invoiced for the remainder amount.”    The $4.26 fee was for a standard $999 mining plan.  Limited compensation  The company went on to offer a chance of buying back contracts for a limited time, as the offer is set to expire on 8th February.  One Reddit user received the following offer for his $999 mining plan:  “In order to avoid management fees, CloudHashing customers may opt to sell their contracts back to Cloud Hashing. You currently have 28.37 Gh/s of CloudHashing contracts. CloudHashing offers to buy these contracts back today for a price of 0.00631990 bitcoins.”  We also obtained an email from one customer who accepted the offer:  “You have accepted the Cloudhashing.com buyout offer. 0.05052865 BTC has been applied to your account.
