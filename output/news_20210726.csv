42407000,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8vYB,1627331828,The Tether Put: Crypto Equivalent of Credit Default Swap?,"Tether, the largest dollar-backed stablecoin, penetrating nearly every nook of the crypto market, is in the news again and for inauspicious reasons.      Perma-bears who are worried that the lingering tether (USDT) scare would eventually culminate in a breaking of the buck might now be searching for the crypto market equivalent of a credit default swap ‚Äì a derivatives instrument that allows buyers to bet on another trading counterparty's creditworthiness.      The answer to that might be a put option on tether, essentially a bet that the stablecoin's price will fall below its ostensible redemption value of $1. Some traders have been actively scouting around for such a trade, according to some players in digital-asset markets.      ""We do continually have inquiries on tether puts,"" said Rich Rosenblum, co-founder, and president at institutional market maker GSR Markets.      Once an academic question, the matter of how to bet against Tether is getting fresh impetus from a report Monday that the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the stablecoin issuer for possible bank fraud. So far, the token, which serves a crucial role in the plumbing of the $1.6 trillion crypto market, has held its peg to the dollar. Tether described the latest report as ""repackaging stale claims as news.""      A put option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish and pays a premium or compensation to the seller for offering insurance against a price drop.      Traders asking for tether puts are essentially looking for a hedge against tether losing its 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar. Tether maintains a dollar peg, helping buyers bypass volatility risks associated with other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. USDT has been widely used to fund crypto purchases over the past 12 months, as evidenced by the sixfold rise in its market capitalization to over $60 billion.      What makes tether controversial is the lingering lack of transparency about the reserves backing it and the growing regulatory unease concerning stablecoins in general.      ""Since the beginnings of the Tether foundation, there have been market participants questioning the stablecoin's reliability,"" Chris Dick, a quant trader at B2C2, said in a Telegram chat.      Some are worried that the stablecoin is not fully backed by liquid reserves and the dollar peg will break if there are mass redemptions, leading to a crypto-equivalent of a bank run. That's a situation when customers start withdrawing money from a bank at once, leading to the insolvency of that institution.      The market could face severe liquidity shock if traders were to lose faith in tether, analysts at JPMorgan said earlier this year. Therefore, it's no surprise that there is some demand for put options on tether. Fulfilling that demand, however, is easier said than done.    Costly affair    Currently, there is no active market for put options on tether. Exchanges don't find a business case there, as technically, there is no exposure to offset. Traders don't make bullish or bearish bets on tether as they do on other assets. It's a stablecoin bought on confidence that eventual redemptions will return an equivalent amount of dollars, and it's used to fund crypto purchases.      Participants fearing a tether collapse need to find a put seller in over-the-counter (OTC) markets or approach market makers. That's a costly affair.      ""Because there is no active market for USDT options or even bitcoin options with tether as counter currency [BTC/USDT], a dealer selling a USDT put cannot hedge the volatility exposure,"" B2C2's Chris Dick said. ""This risk is naturally reflected in the premium paid for a USDT put.""      Market makers and dealers stand on the opposite side of traders and investors and typically run a direction-neutral portfolio. For instance, a market maker selling a bitcoin put option is exposed to a potential price drop and might hedge by selling bitcoin in the spot or futures market.      If that option is not available, the market maker could demand higher compensation or premium from the buyer to justify entering into the trade.      According to GSR's Rosenblum, the high cost has played spoilsport to date. ""The pricing comes out to be too expensive for most buyers,"" he said.      The solution may be dealing in a tether put at a much lower or out-of-the-money strike below $1.00. That would cost relatively less than buying a put at $1.00.      For example, if a fund is looking to hedge against a complete collapse of the Tether foundation, it would likely pick a strike deep out of the money ‚Äì perhaps a price of $0.50 for USDT. That would help keep the fund's premium low but pay off handsomely if the view is realized.      B2C2, being a liquidity provider, doesn't have a view on tether, but stands ready to give a price and other hedging solutions.      ""Any fund managers looking to take this position should consider borrowing USDT from B2C2, collateralized with any currency of their choice,"" Dick said. ""This would allow them to sell their borrowed USDT, giving them a short position that would profit from a fall in USDT/USD.""    Tether put, a bearish bet on the entire market?    According to Kaiko Research, bitcoin-tether trading volume is magnitudes greater than bitcoin-dollar volume. So there are fears that instability with tether's peg might cause market-wide panic.      Binance remains the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume despite the recent regulatory crackdown, a sign traders continue to access its predominantly tether-denominated markets. The stablecoin is also widely used for yield harvesting in decentralized finance protocols.      So buying a put option on a tether option would essentially mean taking a bearish bet on the entire crypto market. That's a factor to consider for the buyer.      ""If USDT were to drop substantially, it likely would be a time when the crypto market, in general, is suffering substantial losses,"" GSR's Rosenblum said.

42407012,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8vj0,1627331042,Market Wrap: Possible Trend Reversal as Bitcoin Spikes Past $40K,"Bitcoin is in rally mode, posting its largest daily gain in six weeks as shorts covered positions over the weekend. The cryptocurrency was trading around $38,874 at press time and is up 14.5% over the past 24 hours. Sentiment has shifted from extreme bearishness after a sharp correction in May and two months of consolidation between $30,000 and $40,000.      Some analysts expect further upside and view the recent bounce as a trend reversal.      ‚ÄúWe turned bullish last Wednesday but weren‚Äôt expecting the short squeeze to happen quite so soon,‚Äù wrote QCP Capital in a Telegram chat. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been pleasantly surprised by how supported the market was after Wednesday and sentiment flipped decisively bullish into the weekend.‚Äù    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $38,874, +14.5%  Ether (ETH) $2,324.7, +9.08%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4422.3, +0.24%  Gold:¬†$1976.8, -0.31%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.293%, compared with 1.281% on Friday.    ‚ÄúThis move higher feels more like a bounce back into a neutral state after being overstretched to the downside below $30K,‚Äù QCP wrote. ‚ÄúThe real pain could be lurking from short gamma positions above the $40K level.‚Äù      ‚ÄúBitcoin momentum is back, and incremental endorsements on Wall Street could easily be the catalyst to help prices rally towards the $45,000 level,‚Äù wrote Edward Moya, strategist at Oanda, in an email to CoinDesk.      Blockchain metrics are also showing positive signs for bitcoin.      ‚ÄúBitcoin has slowly trickled back into the hands of longer-term holders throughout these months after the dramatic sell-off from all-time highs in May,‚Äù wrote Sean Rooney, head of research at crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments, in an email to CoinDesk.      ‚ÄúHistorically this trend of entities that hold long term does not reverse quickly, which will likely result in further advance in price as we move towards Q4,‚Äù Rooney wrote.    Short squeeze confirmed    The strong bounce in bitcoin over the weekend occurred as shorts covered positions. Roughly 2,000 short positions were liquidated over a two-hour period, according to data from CryptoQuant.      The short-squeeze rally occurred despite regulatory pressure surrounding stablecoins.      ‚ÄúThe short order liquidation amount in the past hour reached $640 million, which is the largest single-day liquidation volume in more than two months,‚Äù wrote WuBlockchain in a tweet on Monday.    Bitcoin options expiry    A strike price of $40,000 represents the largest source of open interest for the upcoming bitcoin options expiry this Friday, which could be a source of volatility.      ‚ÄúBTC has been rangebound between $28K-$43K and most expect an upside squeeze to occur on a break above $40K,‚Äù wrote Coinbase in a newsletter to institutional clients on Saturday.      ‚ÄúBut with overwriting strategies forced to settle on lower strikes ($35K-$38K), a sharp short-covering rally will likely begin from lower levels,‚Äù Coinbase wrote.    Weekly fund flows    They missed out.      Investors pulled money out of digital-asset funds as bitcoin dipped below $30,000 last week, according to a report Monday by CoinShares. Outflows coincided with negative sentiment that preceded a near-24% price jump in bitcoin over the past seven days.      Monday‚Äôs crypto price rally ‚Äì bitcoin jumped above $38,000 ‚Äì could encourage digital-asset inflows because many investors have been on the sidelines since the sell-off in May.    Altcoin roundup  USDT maintains dollar peg: USDT has largely held its dollar peg since Bloomberg reported Monday that the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating Tether, issuer of the largest stablecoin, for possible bank fraud. The token, which serves as crucial plumbing for the $1.6 trillion crypto market, has traded at $1 for most of its history, but past scares have caused it to temporarily lose parity with the greenback. In 2018, for example, USDT fell to as low as 92 cents amid concerns about its collateral and about Bitfinex, the crypto exchange that shares owners and managers with Tether. The reaction to the latest news is mild by comparison.  Altcoin rally: Bitcoin‚Äôs price surge early Monday led a rally in so-called altcoins, with aave (AAVE), chainlink (LINK) and bitcoin cash (BCH) notching double-digit percentage gains. Aave, an open-source and non-custodial protocol that runs on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend and borrow a range of crypto assets, has climbed 18% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Chainlink, a decentralized oracle network, was trading at $19.17, representing a 14% gain in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin Cash, the blockchain that forked off Bitcoin in 2017, was up 13%.  Uniswap Labs Limits Access to Some Tokens: Uniswap Labs is restricting access to some tokens, including tokenized stocks and derivatives on the protocol interface that it supports, the software development studio said in a blog posting Friday. The news comes days after U.S. regulators‚Äô announcement that they would increasingly scrutinize these types of decentralized finance (DeFi) products. Uniswap cited an ‚Äúevolving regulatory landscape‚Äù in explaining its decision.

42407011,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8vg3,1627330891,"Tether's Collapse Would Be Chaotic, Not Cataclysmic","According to a new report from Bloomberg, an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department is weighing whether criminal charges should be filed against executives of stablecoin issuer Tether. The charges reportedly stem from Tether lying about the nature of its business when it was opening bank accounts around the world.      Tether has issued a statement saying the Bloomberg report ‚Äúfollows a pattern of repackaging stale claims as ‚Äònews,‚Äô‚Äù but did not deny awareness of pending charges. Such charges would be credible based on known information, including public admissions by Phil Potter, CEO of Tether's conjoined-twin company Bitfinex, of using ‚Äúcat and mouse tricks‚Äù to maintain banking access. Tether was also linked to Crypto Capital Corp., a now-shuttered shadow bank that allegedly engaged in similar bank fraud on behalf of crypto clients.      The report adds a sharp edge to long-simmering concerns about Tether‚Äôs financial stability. Tether claims its dollar-denominated tokens are backed by an equal value of assets held by the company. But the company has never presented a full formal audit of its balance sheet, despite repeatedly promising to do so. In February, the company paid an $18.5 million settlement to New York‚Äôs attorney general (NYAG) related to allegations that it had previously misrepresented its backing. Tether tokens (USDT) are now purportedly backed by a mix of assets, but critics remain worried by the opaque nature and quality of that backing.      Despite vindication in the NYAG case, ‚ÄúTether truthers‚Äù have met fierce blowback from crypto traders and others. That‚Äôs at least in part because USDT has been a key tool for traders to move money safely and quickly, and for roughly half a decade, there were no truly superior alternatives. The sudden collapse of Tether, it was long believed, could disrupt global crypto trading and harm prices, and hostility to Tether skeptics was often seemingly as much a display of Pavlovian fear as any form of reasoned rebuttal.      But things have changed, and the market would no longer necessarily be deeply disrupted by an unwinding of Tether. More tightly regulated stablecoins have grown immensely in recent years, particularly Circle‚Äôs USDC, which has ballooned to a $27 billion market cap, nearly half of Tether‚Äôs issued volume. A wind down of Tether at this point would be chaotic, in other words, but not crippling.    Read more: A Bridge Called Tether | Opinion    That suggests a scenario where Tether can be retired, calmly and (one may hope) smoothly. This old dog has worked hard ‚Äì it‚Äôs time for some well-deserved time at a farm out in the country.    The not-so-great unwinding    The interesting thing about criminal charges against corporate executives is that, in principle, they can leave a company itself intact and free to operate. We saw that with the charges filed last year against former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes and two other founders of the crypto derivatives exchange. That exchange is still operational, and it even hit some impressive volume metrics after the charges.      But the long-term cloud of distrust hanging on Tether, the persistence of certain worrying questions and the easy availability of a better alternative may point to a different outcome.      Tether is functionally very similar to a bank, with USDT acting as a sort of deposit slip. Traders or others who want to hold tether give money or other assets to Tether, which then issues USDT. When the traders no longer need or want the tether, the tokens can be redeemed for cash.      The question facing tether users, now as ever, is just how reliable that redemption process is likely to be ‚Äì or, put even more simply, whether Tether‚Äôs reserves actually add up to the $61 billion worth of tokens in circulation. If they don‚Äôt, the company may eventually run out of money to pay out in USDT redemptions. This creates the incentive for a run on the bank, and charges against executives would stir up fear even more ‚Äì even if the charges aren't directly related to the question of reserves.      Once it stopped claiming to be fully backed by U.S. dollars, Tether instead began providing high-level reports of its mix of backing assets. Skeptics have been focused on the roughly 15% of that mix made up of commercial bonds, basically loans to corporations. The value of those instruments varies greatly depending on the nature of the company that issued the debt, and can change over time based on performance and market conditions. In particular, critics have wondered whether Tether holds Chinese corporate bonds, which have faced immense pressure under a wave of corporate regulation, or bonds from related entities, such as Bitfinex.      The ‚Äúrelated entities‚Äù question is particularly worrying, because prices and current values for such instruments could be set by an internal negotiation rather than by market forces. That means they could be inflated to fill holes in Tether‚Äôs reserve balance sheet, but would be difficult or impossible to sell for their declared prices if Tether needed to convert them to cash. (As I discussed recently on the podcast Crypto Critics Corner, that would be similar to the structured finance tactics that propped up Enron before its collapse.)      That would be particularly true if they are bonds issued by crypto companies, because Tether redemptions could increase during periods of declining crypto markets. That‚Äôs also when bonds from Bitfinex or other crypto entities would be extremely difficult to cash out at their book value. Such bonds would likely form the proverbial ‚Äúbottom of the barrel‚Äù in the event of a true bank run on Tether: If they turned out to be illiquid, the final holders of USDT might not be able to get their money out.      That risk was highlighted in a recent CNBC interview with some of Tether‚Äôs leadership, itself notable because the executives give very few media interviews. During the interview, the execs stated that Tether has ‚Äúat least 24 hours of liquidity‚Äù for redemptions. That was meant to be reassuring, but finance veterans such as Bloomberg‚Äôs Matt Levine took away quite the opposite.      Speculation about Tether‚Äôs assets, including possible worst-case scenarios, is justified by the lack of actual disclosures from the company. The uncertainty is one of the reasons Circle‚Äôs USDC has managed to gain market share so quickly. Though USDC has itself been criticized for incomplete transparency, Circle‚Äôs status as a U.S.-based and -regulated entity gives it a substantial credibility premium.    Read more: Circle CEO Says USDC to Take High Road, But It‚Äôs a Long Road    While Tether‚Äôs defenders have continued to cry FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) at every new allegation or question, large sections of the market have already decided the risk of Tether isn‚Äôt worth it, given better options. Over the past year, USDC‚Äôs total issuance has grown from just over $1.1 billion to over $27 billion. Tether‚Äôs supply also expanded immensely during the bull run, but much more slowly in percentage terms ‚Äì from $10.2 billion to just over $62 billion. And Tether‚Äôs growth has effectively stalled for nearly two months.      That points to a broad market rotation already in progress, which is great news for the long-term stability of the crypto market. Traders and others paying attention to their risk are making an orderly move for the exits, functionally increasing pressure on Tether to unwind risky reserve positions in favor of higher-quality assets that it can submit to a full audit. That audit has been promised within months, and would likely ease any redemption pressure on Tether substantially, though Tether has teased an impending audit repeatedly in the past without following through.      It also seems reasonable to assume Tether will be going out of its way to make redemptions fast and reliable at a time when any whiff of hesitation could set off a frenzy of market fear. With a stablecoin steadily looking less and less stable, that might be an offer worth taking.",NEGATIVE,USDT | USDC,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | USDT | USDC,David Z.

Fiat currency-backed stablecoins depend on a match between the value on-chain and the value of assets in an off-chain bank. Financial instruments that are triggered based on off-chain activities or pricing are also dependent on external data feeds, as are supply chain business models.    Paul Brody¬†is EY's global blockchain leader and a¬†CoinDesk¬†columnist.    All business agreements are based on the exchange of one item of value for another, often subject to specific terms and conditions. If any of those assets or the data necessary for the terms and conditions exists off-chain, then you must trust at least one other party in the agreement to be providing truthful information.      That does not mean the value proposition of public blockchains evaporates the moment you leave the realm of cryptocurrencies. However, it does become more complex as there are many different options for how to build trust into business models.    Centralized systems do not offer you a choice of who you trust.    Centralized systems require you to trust a single party. Blockchains offer many choices. As blockchain technology matures, one of the crucial business advantages of the ecosystem will not be the lack of trust, but the rich set of choices of whom you trust.      Further, centralized systems do not offer you a choice of who you trust. You must trust the operator of the network, and that trust is often an all-or-nothing proposition.      Selling your product in a digital marketplace? Chances are you agreed that the marketplace operator can set fees, change them and adjudicate disputes when and how they please. They are free to shut off your account or change the terms of the deal whenever they want. If you don‚Äôt trust them, you are free to not join the marketplace, but that may not be a commercially viable choice.      Decentralized systems have no central authority with equivalent power. Instead, there are a range of options. Top of the list are oracles, which are going to become increasingly critical for verifying off-chain data. Tied closely together with oracles are algorithms that are designed to reward reliable behavior and punish bad behavior, and wherever possible, to do so based on multiple redundant sources of data. These algorithms include economic incentives for people to trust but verify.      When it comes to applying human judgment, there are two major options: the wisdom of crowds and the rigor of experts. Crowd-sourced decision-making fits with the governance models of many blockchain systems, but it can also turn key decisions into a popularity contest.¬†What‚Äôs right isn‚Äôt always what is popular. Rigorous external expertise, the kind you get from auditors and external specialists, has its own appeal and is already widely used in the legacy world of audits of all kinds, from financial statements to security systems.    Read more: The Age of Autonomous Supply Chains    The history of off-chain trusted systems shows that there is no one perfect method, group or system that works all the time and in every situation. Auditors get bamboozled, crowds are duped, and algorithms prove over and over again that they can be hacked and manipulated.      What is different and exciting about the world of public blockchains is that the future is one in which being trustworthy isn‚Äôt just a part of business, it is itself a competitive business.

42434911,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuLnh,1627323336,USDT Maintains Dollar Peg as Traders Shrug Off DOJ Tether Probe Report,"There‚Äôs at least one cryptocurrency that appears impervious right now to the infamous ‚ÄúTether FUD‚Äù (fear, uncertainty, and doubt): Tether‚Äôs own token.      USDT has largely held its dollar peg since Bloomberg reported Monday that the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating Tether, issuer of the largest stablecoin, for possible bank fraud.      The token, which serves as crucial plumbing for the $1.6 trillion crypto market, has traded at $1 for most of its history, but past scares have caused it to temporarily lose parity with the greenback.      In 2018, for example, USDT fell to as low as 92 cents on concerns about its collateral and about Bitfinex, the crypto exchange that shares owners and managers with Tether.      The reaction to the latest news is mild by comparison:      Tether ‚Äúgets sued every other day,‚Äù scoffed Darius Sit, co-founder of Singapore-based QCP Capital, who suggested that the very properties of USDT that attract regulators‚Äô ire are what give it utility.      ‚ÄúThe FUD is the reason [USDT] is popular, right?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs FUD because it‚Äôs unregulated and people use it because the SEC (the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) can‚Äôt just freeze it.‚Äù      At the same time, the broader crypto markets have continued climbing: Bitcoin‚Äôs price is changing hands at $39,30 7.84, up by 13.82% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20. Some market observers have hypothesized that traders may have rotated money out of USDT and into bitcoin and other cryptos, sending the overall crypto markets higher.      The ‚Äúmarket clearly doesn‚Äôt care about the seemingly bad DOJ news because the sentiment has shifted to bullish,‚Äù said Hassan Bassiri, vice president at Los Angeles-based asset management firm Arca.      Other analysts and traders also said that the Bloomberg report felt more like noise than¬†a signal.      ‚ÄúMy guess is that this isn't something really telling until [Tether] gets actually convicted of this crime,‚Äù Andrew Tu, an executive at quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier, told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúAlso because they are being investigated for past events, whereas the New York attorney general office settled with Tether just recently, the market probably doesn't see the Tether stablecoin itself as being at risk.‚Äù      According to the report by Bloomberg, which cited anonymous sources, the DOJ is investigating Tether for a possible offense conducted ‚Äúyears ago.‚Äù Tether issued a statement that stopped short of denying the claims, calling them ‚Äústale‚Äù and ‚Äúrecycle[d].‚Äù      Earlier this year, Tether and its sister crypto exchange Bitfinex settled an investigation by the New York attorney general‚Äôs office (NYAG) into whether the stablecoin issuer was covering up the loss of nearly $1 billion in customer funds.      Another reason why the markets appear unfazed by the DOJ news could be that Tether revealed the breakdown of its reserves for the first time in May, clearing out at least some worries around USDT‚Äôs backing.      ‚ÄúAfter last time they disclosed their treasury allocation, people came to peace with it,‚Äù Annabelle Huang, partner at Hong Kong-based Amber Group, said.      Stuart Hoegner, Tether‚Äôs general counsel, also recently said in a CNBC interview that an audit for Tether could be ‚Äúmonths away, not years‚Äù ‚Äì the USDT issuer promised audits as far back as 2017, but has yet to produce one.      Hoegner‚Äôs comment came as investors have been demanding more transparency from stablecoin issuers broadly.

The first cryptocurrency by market cap records a 13% profit on the daily and a 21.1% profit on the weekly chart and trades at $38,622. The move to the upside came as a surprise for most of the traders as Bitcoin&apos;s price on Binance Futures even managed to break above $48,000 for a brief moment.

When BTC&apos;s price approached the $35,000 and $36,000, bears displayed weakness and were unable to support a compelling pullback.

42434910,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuLlh,1627321270,"Bigger, Better, Faster, Same ‚Äì Crypto's Builders Are Upgrading, Not Breaking Ground","Everyone's building decentralized finance, even bitcoiners.      Jack Dorsey announced¬†a new division of Square¬†that was going to build an open financial infrastructure using Bitcoin as its basis.¬†RSK and Sovryn¬†have already been doing¬†decentralized finance (DeFi)¬†for Bitcoin for a while now.      Does anyone want to try to come up with new applications for blockchain technology any longer? It doesn't seem that way.    This article is excerpted from¬†The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full¬†newsletter here.    Bitcoin was a step change in technology because it proved that cash value can exist online in a purely digital way. Ethereum was a step change because it proved computing could be distributed trustlessly.      Nothing else has leveled up the internet since, at least as far as I can tell. Since Bitcoin and Ethereum, every project since has been an attempt to slightly improve what's already come so far.      This isn't so bad, but it's disappointing that all the new changes that are faster, better, smarter versions of what's been done already only seem interested in copying the applications to date as well (mainly¬†DeFi and NFTs).      Some examples: The mood out of the Tezos ecosystem seems to be all about¬†non-fungible tokens. That's a lot of¬†NEAR's vibe¬†these days, too.      Solana got a pretty¬†nice DEX built¬†and it too has moved¬†fast into NFTs, with a little more of an intellectual property orientation, it seems.      Polkadot has appeared to be going more for¬†the DeFi angle, which makes sense because the Polkadot and Ethereum communities go way back.      You get my point.      The only project that even claims to be breaking genuinely new ground is DFinity with¬†its Internet Computer. I don't quite see it, but I'm also not completely dismissive of the idea that it might be. But, much like the other examples, it's not trying to¬†run¬†anything fundamentally different yet. When it¬†went live, it announced applications in DeFi, social networking, infrastructure services and a provenance application ‚Äì all nice lines of business but nothing we haven't seen before.    Read more: FTX to Launch ‚ÄòScalable‚Äô Decentralized Exchange in Weeks    And, look, incremental improvements got TVs from bulky cathode ray tube sets to liquid-organic-dilithium-D^6-ODANG displays today, so it's not for nothing! There's a lot of value to be captured in the whole incremental improvement hustle!      But there's a point in a technology when it feels like blinders have fallen on its builders and inventors can't see beyond those limits.    Greatness isn't born of incremental improvements on what's come before.    With everyone but everyone building exchanges, DeFi and NFTs ‚Äì that is, the same things as everyone else ‚Äì this all feels much like the cities around the world vying to be ""The Next Silicon Valley."" None of them have done it and none of them will.      Even if technology's HQ relocates someday, it won't be because that place did Silicon Valley better, but because it found a paradigm-shifting formula.      Greatness isn't born of incremental improvements on what's come before. Greatness is born of changing what we believe to be possible, and I can't help but think that there is a bit more greatness to be squeezed out of this distributed ledger idea.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/26/bigger-better-faster-same-cryptos-builders-are-upgrading-not-breaking-ground,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe86f593f766e749711e8929bc74c441ac6e0ef7-2048x1362.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The most notable milestones were the Beeple piece, THE FIRST 5000 DAYS, which was auctioned off at Christie&apos;s for $69 million. This proved to be a turning point for digital art and NFTs, which had gone from a place of digitized meme&apos;s like Jack Dorsey&apos;s first Tweet, gifs and songs, to an awakening of modern art, More than just collectible, this was a way that the art world could display more pieces to more people. It took art away from the few, where a piece attached to someone&apos;s wall could now be viewed by millions of people in a digital gallery. However, NFTs hit a bump in the road. The news hit hard about how the minting of one single NFT could consume the same amount of energy as a household in the EU would use over the course of a full month. This marked a turning point for NFTs, with critics claiming that NFTs were bad news. And yet, despite the critics, according to Reuters, the market for NFTs surged to new highs in 2Q21, with $2.5 billion in sales so far, compared to just $13.7 million in the first half of 2020.

The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating Tether for a possible offense conducted years ago, the outlet reported citing people with knowledge of the matter.  The price of bitcoin dipped on the news, falling about $1,000 shortly after the report came out.  Tether, which administers USDT, the crypto market's largest stablecoin, has long been dogged by accusations of murky banking relationships.  Tether and its sister exchange Bitfinex settled an investigation by the New York Attorney General's Office (NYAG) into whether the stablecoin issuer was covering up the loss of nearly $1 billion in customer funds earlier this year.

The intermediate-term downtrend is reversing, although resistance near $40,000 could trigger some profit taking.      Upside momentum is improving after several months of consolidation and multiple oversold readings on the charts. Bitcoin was trading around $38,000 at press time and is up 10% over the past 24 hours. Early Monday, the price climbed to about $39,500.    The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is approaching overbought levels for the first time since April. This could precede a brief period of profit-taking near the 100-day moving average at $40,000.  The weekly RSI is not yet oversold, although selling pressure from May is starting to slow.  Price action is consistent with previous rallies from $30,000 support, albeit more persistent given the break above the 50-day moving average.  Bitcoin remains in a consolidation phase until price moves above $40,000, which is the top of a two-month range.

42434914,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuLvh,1627290392,Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Hit $48K on Binance,"Binance-based bitcoin perpetual futures denominated in dollar-backed stablecoin tether (USDT) spiked early Monday, widening the spread over the spot market price to more than $8,000.      The BTC/USDT perpetual contract hit a high of $48,168 at around 01:00 UTC, Binance data show. Around the same time, bitcoin jumped almost $3,000 in the spot market, reaching a 1 1/2-month high of $39,544, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The cryptocurrency looked poised for a rally, having toppled the widely-tracked 50-day moving average (MA) resistance at $35,000 during overnight trading.      The exaggerated bullish move in the perpetual contract probably resulted from a big trade.      ""A user placed a large number of [buy] orders for BTC/USDT perpetual futures during the market upswing, resulting in a candlewick of 48,168 USDT,"" Binance's spokesperson told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""We reviewed and did not detect any system issues. No other users were affected as we utilize mark price for liquidation,"" the spokesperson said.      Binance is the world's largest bitcoin futures exchange, contributing $3.5 billion or nearly 10% of the global open interest of $13.9 billion, according to data provided by Skew. Open interest refers to the number of futures contracts traded but not matched by an offsetting position.      Aside from large buy orders, short liquidations or forced closure of sell positions due to margin shortage may have added upward pressure on prices.      According to data source Coinalyze, major exchanges including Binance have liquidated futures positions worth more than $650 million today. Of that, short liquidations account for almost 85%, or $550 million. The data show that futures market positioning was skewed bearish. The number of open futures contracts rose steadily since late May to hit a two-month high last week as traders took short positions.      The crypto derivatives market has seen explosive growth since the March 2020 crash. One effect of that is price volatility caused by long-short liquidations. ""We would like to take this opportunity to remind the community that the crypto market can be volatile and all trading carries risks. We advise all users to trade responsibly and only trade within their means,"" Binance's spokesperson said.      Also read: Bitcoin Breaks Back Above $39K in Largest Single Daily Gain in 6 Weeks      The situation may improve going forward as Binance and FTX, two of the biggest exchanges, have imposed limits on leverage. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, announced early today that it had imposed a 20x leverage limit for new users starting from July 19, down from the original 100x leverage. Zhao said the new limit would be applied to existing users progressively over the next few weeks.      At press time, bitcoin was changing hands near $38,200, representing a 10% gain on the day.

42434908,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuLjh,1627275385,Blockchain Australia Recommends Safe Harbor Provision for Crypto Providers,"A leading blockchain industry body in Australia says the country's current regulatory framework for crypto falls short, particularly when it comes to derivatives trading.      Blockchain Australia (BA) has written to the country's Senate Select Committee on Australia as a Technology and Financial Centre, making three primary recommendations, according to a paper released on Friday.      Its recommendations are in response to the committee's request for submissions from industry participants on how to improve Australia's standing as a ""technology and financial"" hub. The industry body is calling for a ""coordinated and graduated approach"" to the regulation of digital assets.      BA's recommendations include implementing immediate safe harbor provisions for crypto providers, greater regulatory guidance, and engagement in the short-term while in the long-term overseeing the establishment of a ""fit-for-purpose legislative framework.""      ""A staged fit-for-purpose approach, as recommended in the submission, requires consultative and considered commitment of resources,"" BA CEO Steve Vallas told CoinDesk via Telegram. ""The submission details the accelerating pace of development across the world. The opportunity for Australia to lead a regulatory discussion will pass.""      It's not the first time BA has asked for greater regulatory clarity and considerations for a measured approach to regulating blockchain and crypto. In February the body put forward recommendations to the same committee over the need for more support from the federal government and regulators to boost the confidence of the country‚Äôs blockchain businesses.      The first step, BA recommends, should provide crypto asset providers with a window of time until the introduction of guidance or legislation occurs. ""Any legislation should contain an appropriate transition period and not apply retrospectively,"" the paper reads.      BA also says a ""new licensing regime modelled off the existing Australian Financial Services Licence,"" should be implemented to allow the provision of cryptocurrency financial advice from those involved. Crypto derivatives under the existing licensing legislation are ""fundamentally different"" from traditional derivatives, argues BA.

BA says continuous disclosure rules in respect to price-sensitive announcements, custody, clearing and settlement rules, and trading halts are inappropriate for the crypto derivatives market.

42434913,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuLrh,1627263299,Bitcoin Breaks Back Above $39K in Largest Single Daily Gain in 6 Weeks,"Bitcoin briefly traded above $39,000 for the first time since June 16 and is currently trading its sixth consecutive day in the green.      Prices have continued to rally since July 21, with Sunday's current price rise representing the largest single daily gain in over six weeks. The world's oldest crypto is changing hands for around $38,250, having cooled slightly after hitting a monthly high of around $39,850.      Datamish data show a short squeeze appears to have driven prices higher as those betting on bitcoin heading lower had to sell in quick succession to cover. The reason remains unclear.      ""This price action is aligning with what we‚Äôve been seeing the past couple of weeks,"" said Daniel Kim, head of capital markets at Maple Finance. ""Borrowing rates for USD have started to increase from its lows.""      ""We‚Äôve also been seeing a significant increase in demand for USDC from institutional borrowers and the sentiment seems to be bullish following the news of Amazon participating in bitcoin,"" Kim added.      An unconfirmed single-source story in City A.M. has reported retail giant Amazon is looking to accept bitcoin payments by year's end and is considering minting its own token by 2022. The retail giant is also seeking a Digital Currency and Blockchain Product Lead, CoinDesk previously reported.      CoinDesk attempted to contact Amazon but did not receive a reply by press time.      Others argue the rebound in crypto prices is a reaction to a range of good news coming from big tech and finance players from the U.S. markets.      ""Most prominently, there were conversations held last week between Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk, and Cathie Wood at the Bitcoin Conference where they talked about where they see bitcoin and cryptocurrencies going with respect to their own organizations,"" said Caroline Bowler, CEO of Australian crypto exchange BTC markets.
